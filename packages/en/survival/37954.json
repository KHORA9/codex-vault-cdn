At best of times\r\nit was dangerous.  More than one of them had sacrificed a horse to it\r\nat some time or other.  Some had come near to sacrificing more.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours in the field, wound up by a fast five-and-twenty\r\nminutes' run which had led round Endsley Wood and the coppices almost\r\nto Wynn Hall, and then back through Dursel Bottom, and up Whin Hill, it\r\nwas too much to ask of any horse.  Besides, it meant the end of the run\r\nin any case, for that old fox, if he failed to shake them off\r\nelsewhere, always made for the Roman Road and always managed it there.\r\n\r\nThe hedge on this side was as thick and matted a quickset as ever grew.\r\nThe sunk road had no doubt originally been a covered way from the old\r\nfort up above.  It was indeed more of a trench than a road, with a\r\nsheer descent from the quickset of ten good feet, a width of about as\r\nmuch, and a grass slope on the other side at a somewhat lower level.\r\n\r\nThe leap was therefore by no means impossible if your horse could rise\r\nto the hedge and cover the distance and the extra bit for a footing.\r\n\r\nBut what was the good?  The bottom of the old road was always a muddy\r\ndribble from the fields above, and up and down it went several flocks\r\nof sheep whenever they changed pasture.  And the wily old fox knew the\r\neffect of these things on scent as well as any hound or huntsman.  So,\r\nwhen it was his day, and he had had enough of them, he made for the Old\r\nRoman Road, and then went home with a curl in his lip and a laugh in\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\nBut there were riders among them to whom a ride was nothing without a\r\nrisk in it, and the Roman Road a standing test and temptation.  It was\r\ntwo such that the rest who had got that length stood watching, some\r\nwith tightened faces, none without anxiety.  For a leap that is good\r\nsport when one's horse is fresh may mean disaster at the end of the\r\nrun.  Even old Job, the huntsman, and young Job, his son, who acted as\r\nwhipper-in, watched with pinched faces and panted oaths between their\r\nteeth.  Pasley Carew, the Master, lifted his foam-flecked black to the\r\nhedge, and the dull crash of his fall came up to them, horribly clear\r\non the still autumn air.\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale, the Doctor, on his big bay, cleared hedge and road with\r\nfeet to spare, flung himself off as soon as he could pull up, and ran\r\nback to help.\r\n\r\nIt was as bad as it could be.  Carew lay in the road, smothered in mud\r\nand obviously damaged.  His horse had just rolled off him, and the\r\nDoctor saw at a glance that one of its forelegs was broken.  It was\r\nkicking out wildly with its heels, flailing clods out of the steep bank\r\nand floundering in vain attempts to rise.\r\n\r\nCarew, on one elbow, was cursing it with every oath he could lay tongue\r\nto, and with the pointed bone handle of his crop in the other hand was\r\nhammering the poor brute's head to pulp.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, Carew!\" shouted Wulfrey, sickened at the sight, as he jumped\r\ndown the bank.  \"Damn it, man, it wasn't her fault!\"\r\n\r\n\"---- her!  She's broken my back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have tried it.  I told you you were too heavy for her.\r\nStop it, I say!\" and he wrenched the crop, all dripping with hair and\r\nblood, out of the other's hand, and with difficulty bit off the hot\r\nwords that surged in his throat.  For the man was broken and hardly\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard age and given to forceful language.  But never in any age\r\nare there lacking some to whom brutality to the dumb beast appeals as\r\nkeenly as ill-treatment of their fellows.\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale was of these, and a great lover of horses besides, and\r\nCarew's maltreatment of his broken beast cut him to the quick.\r\n\r\nWith another quick look at the useless leg, and a bitter word which he\r\ncould not keep in, at the horror of the mauled head, he drew from his\r\npocket a long knife, which had seen service on many a field, opened it,\r\npressed down the blinded tumbling head with one hand, and with the\r\nother deftly inserted the blade at the base of the skull behind the\r\nears and drove it home with all his force, severing the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old girl!\" he said, as, with a quick sigh of relief, the great\r\nblack body lay still.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Carew and knelt down to examine into his injuries.\r\n\r\n\"No need,\" said the broken man.  \"Curse it all!  Get a gate.  My back's\r\ngone.  I've no legs,\"--and the others, having found their roundabout\r\nways, came flocking up, while the dogs still nosed eagerly up and down\r\nthe road but got no satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYoung Job plied his whip and his tongue and carried them away.  His\r\nfather looked at Carew, then at the Doctor, who nodded, and the old man\r\nturned and hurried away to get what long experience of such matters\r\ntold him was needed.\r\n\r\n\"Take a pull at this, Carew,\" said the Doctor, handing him a flask.\r\nAnd as he drank deeply, as though to deaden the pain or the thought of\r\nit, Dale beckoned to one of the group which stood a little aloof lest\r\nthe broken man should take their anxiety for morbid curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Barclay, will you ride on and break it to Mrs. Carew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, his back's broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" and he stumbled off to his horse, and with a word to the\r\nrest, mounted and rode away.\r\n\r\nOld Job came back in a minute or two with a hurdle he had rooted up\r\nfrom the sheep-fold, and they lifted the Master on to it and carried\r\nhim slowly and heavily home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCarew was on the front door steps as they came up the drive.  The\r\nDoctor went on in advance to speak to her.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" she jerked breathlessly, as he strode up.\r\n\r\n\"Not dead.  Badly broken.  He may live,\" and her tightened lips pinched\r\na trifle tighter.\r\n\r\nShe was a slight, extremely pretty woman of three and twenty,\r\nwhite-faced at the moment with the sudden shock; in her blue eyes a\r\ncurious startled look--anxiety?--expectancy?  Even Dale, who had known\r\nher all his life, could not have said.  All he knew was that it was not\r\nquite the look one found in some wives' faces in similar circumstances,\r\nand this was not the first he had seen.\r\n\r\nShe looked scarcely more than a girl, though she had been married five\r\nyears.  That was due largely to the slim grace of her figure.  Her face\r\nwas thinner than he had known it, less eloquent of her feelings,\r\nsomewhat tense and repressed, and her eyes seemed larger; and all that,\r\nhe knew, was due to the fact that it was to Pasley Carew to whom she\r\nhad been married for five years, for he had seen these changes come\r\nupon her gradually.\r\n\r\nThey had played together as boy and girl, when he was just little Wulf\r\nDale, the Doctor's son, and she Elinor Baynard, living with her mother\r\nat Glynne.  As youth and maiden they had flirted and even sweet-hearted\r\nfor a time.  But Mrs Baynard of Glynne had no intention of letting her\r\npretty girl throw herself away on a mere country doctor's son, however\r\nhighly she might esteem both father and son personally.\r\n\r\nWulf had at that time still to prove himself, and even if he did so,\r\nand eventually succeeded his father in the practice, it meant no more\r\nthan a good living at the cost of constant hard work.\r\n\r\nElinor, she was sure, had been gifted by Nature with that face and\r\nfigure for some better portion in life than that of a country doctor's\r\nwife, and so she saw to it that the feelings of the young people should\r\nnot get too deeply entangled before it was too late.\r\n\r\nAs for Elinor herself she was very fond of Wulf.  She liked him indeed\r\nalmost well enough to sacrifice everything for him.  But not quite.  If\r\nhe had only been in the position and possessions of Pasley Carew of the\r\nHall, now, she would have married him without a moment's hesitation,\r\nand she would undoubtedly have had much greater chance of happiness\r\nthan was vouchsafed her.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, Wulf had ardently pushed his suit he might possibly have\r\nprevailed on her to marry him in spite of her mother, though whether\r\nWulf without the possessions would have satisfied her eventually may be\r\ndoubted.  But Wulf, two years older than herself, had no intention of\r\nmarrying at twenty, even if his father would have heard of it.\r\n\r\nHe was a gay, good-looking fellow, with the cheerfullest of humours,\r\nand on the best of terms with every man, woman and child, over all the\r\ncountry-side.  Moreover he was an excellent shot, a fearless rider,\r\ngood company at table, an acceptable and much-sought-after\r\nguest,--whenever circumstances and cases permitted of temporary release\r\nfrom duties with which no social engagements were ever allowed to\r\ninterfere.  Marrying and settling down were for the years to come.\r\n\r\nAs his father's assistant he had proved his capabilities.  And when the\r\nold man died, Wulf stepped up into the vacant saddle and filled it with\r\nperfect acceptation to all concerned.\r\n\r\nHis ready sympathy, and his particular interest in and devotion to\r\neveryone who claimed his services, endeared him to his patients.  They\r\nvowed that the sight of him did them as much good as his medicines, but\r\nhe made them take the medicines all the same.\r\n\r\nHe had also lately been appointed Deputy-Coroner for the district, in\r\norder, in case of need, to relieve Dr Tamplin--old Tom Tamplin who\r\nlived at Aldersley, ten miles away.  So that matters were prospering\r\nwith him all round.  All men spoke well of him, and the women still\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nA practitioner from the outside, with a London degree and much\r\nassurance, had indeed hung out his large new brass plate in the village\r\nabout a year before, and lived on there in hope which showed no sign of\r\nfulfilment.  For everyone knew and liked Wulf Dale, and Dr Newman,\r\nM.B., clever though he might be and full worthy of his London degree,\r\nwas still an outsider and an unknown quantity, and the way of the\r\nmedical outsider in a country district is apt to be as hard as the way\r\nof the transgressor.\r\n\r\nSo Elinor Baynard, for the sake of her bodily comfort and her own and\r\nher mother's worldly ambitions, married Pasley Carew and became\r\nMistress of Croome, and learned all too soon that it is possible to pay\r\ntoo high a price even for bodily comfort and the realisation of worldly\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nWorldly ambition may, indeed, be made to appear successfully attained,\r\nto the outside world; but bodily comfort, being dependent more or less\r\non peace of mind, is not to be secured when heart and mind are sorely\r\nexercised and bruised.\r\n\r\nJealous Jade Rumour even went the length of whispering that it was not\r\nheart and mind alone that had on occasion suffered bruising in this\r\ncase.  For Carew was notoriously quick-tempered and easily upset--and\r\nnotoriously many other things also.  His grooms and boys knew the feel\r\nof his hunting-crop better than his reasons for using it at\r\ntimes--though doubtless occasion was not lacking.  As to his\r\nlanguage!--it was said that the very horses in his stables lashed out\r\nwhen he began, as though they believed that, by much kicking, curses\r\nmight be pulverised in mid-air and rendered innocuous.\r\n\r\nNow a wife cannot--Elinor at all events could not--kick even to that\r\nextent under the application of sulphur or riding-whip.  Nor can she\r\nlegally, except in the extremest case, throw up her situation, as the\r\nstable-boys could, but did not.  For the pay in both cases was good,\r\nand for the sake of it the one and the other put up with the\r\ndiscomforts appertaining to their positions.\r\n\r\nPasley Carew's redeeming characteristics were a large estate and\r\nrent-roll, sporting instincts, and extreme openhandedness in everything\r\nthat ministered to his own pleasures.\r\n\r\nHe ran the hounds and was a fine rider, though over-hard on his horses,\r\nwith whom he was never on terms of intimate friendship.  He esteemed\r\nthem solely for their carrying capacities.  He preserved, was a good\r\nshot, and free with his invitations to the less-happily situated.  He\r\nwas a jovial host and a hard drinker as was the fashion.  He enjoyed\r\nseeing his friends at his table and under it.  He was not a hard\r\nlandlord, and this, and his generosity in the matter of compensation\r\nfor hunt-damage, secured him the good-will of the country-side and\r\npalliated all else.\r\n\r\nMorals were slack in those days, and no one would have thought for a\r\nmoment of affronting Carew by calling him a moral man.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Elinor paid a somewhat high price for the bodily comfort\r\nfrom which--according to the Jealous Jade--sulphurous language and an\r\noccasional blow were not lacking, and for the satisfaction of a worldly\r\nambition which, if the gradual shadowing of her pretty face was\r\nanything to go by, had not brought her any great peace of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale was a very general favourite.  With men and women alike,\r\nquite irrespective of their station in life, his manner was\r\nirresistibly frank and charming.  With the women it might be said to be\r\nalmost unfortunately so.\r\n\r\nHe was so absolutely and unaffectedly sympathetic, so exclusively and\r\ndevotedly interested in every woman he met, that it is hardly matter\r\nfor wonder that in many quarters impressionable hearts beat high at his\r\ncoming, and thought tenderly and hopefully of him when he had gone.\r\nThat, too, in spite of the fact that their owners knew perfectly well\r\nthat it was simply Wulf's way, as it had been his father's before him,\r\nand that neither of them could change his nature any more than he could\r\nchange his skin or the colour of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep and genuine human interest in every man, woman and child\r\nwith whom he came into contact, and showed it.  With men and children\r\nit made for good-fellowship and extraordinary confidence.  The older\r\nfolk all trusted young Wulfrey as they had all their lives trusted the\r\nold Doctor.  The children would talk to him as between man and man, and\r\nwith an artlessness and candour which as a rule obtained only among\r\nthemselves.  With the women it led in some cases to little affections\r\nof the heart--flutterings and burnings and barely-self-confessed\r\ndisappointments, for which their owners, if honest in their searchings\r\nafter truth, had to acknowledge that the blame lay entirely with\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of hard drinking, hard riding, and quite superfluously\r\nstrong language, but none the less, among the women-folk, of a\r\nsentiment which in these days of wider outlook and opportunity we\r\nshould denominate as sickly.  The blame was not all theirs.\r\n\r\nSo far Wulf had shown exceptional interest or favour in no direction,\r\nthat is to say in all, and so none could claim to say with any\r\ncertainty in which way the wind blew, or even if it blew at all.\r\n\r\nNot a few held that Elinor Baynard's marriage with Pasley Carew had so\r\nwounded his affections that it was probable he would never marry,\r\nunless----.  And therein lay strictly private grounds for hope in many\r\na heart.\r\n\r\nFor a heart-broken man, however, Wulfrey managed to maintain an\r\nextremely cheerful face, and his manner to Elinor, whenever they met,\r\nwas just the same as to other women.\r\n\r\nIf it had in fact been somewhat different it would not have been very\r\nsurprising.  For it needed no professional acumen to recognise that her\r\nmarriage with Pasley had not fulfilled her expectations.\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed, Mrs Carew of Croome, mistress of the Hall and all such\r\namenities--and otherwise--and luxuries of living as appertained to so\r\nexalted a position, winner of the prize so many had coveted, and--wife\r\nof Pasley Carew.  And sometimes it is possible she wished she were none\r\nof these things because of the last.\r\n\r\nFor Carew made no pretence of perfection, or even of modest\r\nimpeccability, never had done so since the day he was born, never would\r\ntill the day he must die, would have scorned the very idea.  Was he not\r\na man,--rich and hot-blooded, able and accustomed all his life to have\r\nhis own way in all things, easy enough to get on with when he got it,\r\notherwise when thwarted?\r\n\r\nAnd Wulfrey Dale had seen the freshness of the maiden-bloom fade out of\r\nElinor's pretty face, in these five years of her attainment, had seen\r\nit stiffen in self-repression, and even harden somewhat.  Her eyes had\r\nseemed to grow larger, and there were sometimes dark shadows under\r\nthem.  Without doubt she had not found any too large measure of the\r\ncomfort and happiness she had looked for.  At times, mind acting on\r\nbody, her health was not of the best, and then she sent for Wulfrey to\r\nminister to her bodily necessities, and found that he could do it best\r\nby allowing her to relieve her mind of some of its burdens.\r\n\r\nThey had always been on such friendly terms that she could, and did,\r\ntalk to him as to no other.  Her mother was worse than useless as a\r\nburden-sharer.  Her only counsel was not to be too thin-skinned, and\r\nabove all to present a placid face to the world.  Which, as medicine to\r\na sorely-tried soul, was easier to give than to take, and proved quite\r\nineffective.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, on the other hand, gave her tonics, and, to the fullest limits\r\nof his duty to Carew, his deepest sympathy in her troubles and\r\nvexations, and his friendly advice towards encouragement and hope of\r\nbetter times, when Pasley's hot blood would begin to cool and he would\r\nsettle down to less objectionable courses.\r\n\r\nAt times, under stress and suffering from some more than usually\r\nimmoderate outbreak on her husband's part, she would let herself go in\r\na way that pained and surprised him, both as friend and doctor.  He\r\ndoubted if she always told him all, even at such times.  More than once\r\nshe had seemed on the point of still wilder outbreak, and it was all he\r\ncould do to soothe her and bring her back to a more reasonable frame of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she openly threatened to take her life, since it was no\r\nlonger worth living, and it took Wulfrey a good hour to wring from her\r\na solemn promise not to do so without first consulting him.  So\r\nover-wrought and alternately excited and depressed was she that there\r\nwere times when, in spite of her promise, he would not have been\r\ngreatly surprised by a sudden summons to the Hall with the news that\r\nits mistress had made a summary end of her troubles.\r\n\r\nHis mind was sorely exercised on her account, but it was only the\r\neffects that came within his province.  The root of the trouble was\r\nbeyond his tackling.  He did, indeed, after much debate within himself,\r\nbring himself to the point of discussing the matter, in strictest\r\nconfidence, with the parson, one night.  But he, jovial sportsman and\r\nrecipient of many bounties from Pasley, including the privilege of\r\nsubsiding under his table whenever invitation offered, genially but\r\nflatly refused to interfere between man and wife.\r\n\r\n\"No good ever comes of it, Doctor.  You know that as well as any man.\r\nIt's only the intruder suffers.  They both turn and rend him like boars\r\nof the wood and wild beasts of the field.  Take my advice and leave 'em\r\nalone.  These things always straighten themselves out in time--one way\r\nor the other.  Deuce take the women!  They're not blind kittens when\r\nthey marry.  They've got to take the rough with the smooth.  Another\r\nglass of punch before you go!\"--was the irreverent Reverend's final\r\nword on the matter.  And Wulfrey could do no more in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was under such circumstances that they carried Pasley Carew home to\r\nCroome on the hurdle; under such circumstances that Elinor met them on\r\nthe steps and asked Wulfrey, with that curious, startled look in her\r\neyes which might be anxiety and might be expectancy.--\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Wulfrey, subconsciously wondering whether she really had got the\r\nlength of hoping for her husband's death, and subconsciously feeling\r\nthat if it were so it was not much to be wondered at, though\r\nundoubtedly greatly to be deplored, had answered her, somewhat sternly,\r\n\"Not dead.  Badly broken.  He may live,\"--for the shock of the whole\r\nmatter, and the extreme discomfort of having had to sever that poor\r\nBlackbird's spinal cord, were still heavy on him.\r\n\r\nElinor shot one sharp, searching glance at his face, and turned and\r\nwent on before the bearers to show them the way.\r\n\r\nThe staircase at Croome was a somewhat notable one, wide enough to\r\naccommodate hurdle and bearers with room to spare, so they carried the\r\nMaster right up to his own bedroom and as gently as possible\r\ntransferred him to his bed.\r\n\r\nThe explosive fury of his outbreak against Fate and Blackbird, in the\r\nfirst shock of his fall, had been simply a case of vehement passion\r\ndisregarding, and momentarily overcoming, the frailty of the flesh.\r\nExhaustion and collapse followed, and as they carried him home he lay\r\nstill and barely conscious.\r\n\r\nHe came to himself again as they placed him on the bed, and after lying\r\nfor a moment, as though recalling what had happened, murmured in a\r\nbitter whisper, \"Damnation!  Damnation!  Damnation!\" and his eyes\r\nscrewed up tightly, and his face warped and pinched in agony of mind or\r\nbody, or both.\r\n\r\nAs Wulfrey bent over him, and with gentle hands assured himself of the\r\ndamage, Carew looked up at him out of the depths; horror, desperation,\r\nfurious revolt, hopelessness, all mingled in the wild gleam that\r\ndetected and scorched the pity in Wulfrey's own eyes, and gave him\r\nwarning of dangers to come.\r\n\r\n\"---- it all!  It's no good, Dale,\" he growled hoarsely.  \"I'm done.\r\n---- that horse!  Give me something that'll end it quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk that way, man!  You know I can't do that.  We'll pull you\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"To lie like a log for the rest of my life!  I won't, I tell you.  ----\r\nit, man, can't you understand I'd liefer go at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bring you up a draught and you'll get some rest,\" said Dale\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n\"Rest!  Rest!  A dose of poison is all I want, ---- you!  Don't look at\r\nme like that, ---- _you_!\" to his wife, who stood watching with her\r\nhands tightly clasped as though to hold in her emotions.  She walked\r\naway to the window and stood looking out.\r\n\r\n\"Carew, you--must--be--quiet.  You're doing yourself harm,\" said the\r\nDoctor authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\"Man, I'm in hell.  Poison me, and make an end!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till tomorrow, anyway.  I'll run down and get that draught.  We'll\r\nsee about the other in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Carew turned as he left the room, and followed him out, and the\r\nsick man sank back with a groan and a curse.\r\n\r\n\"Will he die?\" she asked quickly, as she closed the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily.  But if he lives he'll be crippled for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would sooner die than live like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't help that.  It's my business to keep him alive.  I'll run\r\ndown and mix him a draught which may give him some rest.  You'll need\r\nassistance.  He may go off his head.  He's a bad patient.  I'll send\r\nyou someone up----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Jane Pinniger then.  I won't have her.\"\r\n\r\nHe knitted his brows at her.  \"It was Jane I was thinking of.  She's an\r\nexcellent nurse, both brains and brawn, and he may get violent in the\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't have her here,\" said Elinor obstinately, and he remembered\r\nthat gossip had, not so very long ago, been busy with the names of\r\nPasley and Jane, as she had at other times occupied herself with Pasley\r\nand many another.  Undoubtedly Elinor had had much to bear.\r\n\r\n\"All right!  If I can find anyone else----\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"I won't have Jane Pinniger here,\"--and he went off at speed to get the\r\ndraught and find a substitute for Jane if that were possible.\r\n\r\nHis doubts on that head were justified.  He sent his boy up with the\r\ndraught, and started on the search for a nurse who should combine a\r\nmodicum of intelligence with the necessary strength of mind and body.\r\n\r\nBut his choice was very limited.  Old crones there were, satisfactory\r\nenough in their own special line and in a labourer's cottage, but\r\nuseless for a job such as this.  There was nothing for it at last but\r\nto go back to the Hall and tell Mrs Carew that it was Jane or nobody.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody then,\" said she decisively.  \"I will manage with one of the\r\ngirls from downstairs, and young Job to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young Job is all very well with the dogs----\"\r\n\r\n\"He will do very well for this too.  We may not require him, but he can\r\nbe at hand in case of need,\" and he had to leave it at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCarew suffered much, more in mind even than in body.  The thought of\r\nlying there like a damned log, as he put it, for the rest of his days\r\nfilled him with most passionate resentment, and drove him into\r\nparoxysms of raging fury.  He cursed everything under the sun and\r\neveryone who came near him, with a completeness and finality of\r\ninvective which, if it had taken effect or come home to roost, would\r\nhave blighted himself and all his surroundings off the face of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nEven his wife, and the maid who took turns with her to sit within call,\r\naccustomed as they were to his outbreaks, quailed before the storm.\r\nYoung Job alone suffered it without turning a hair, and paid no more\r\nheed to it all, even when directed against himself, than he would to\r\nthe yelping of his dogs.\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale came in for his share, chiefly by reason of his quiet\r\ninattention to the sufferer's impossible demands for extinction.\r\n\r\nBut he found his visits to the sick-room trying even to his seasoned\r\nnerves.  What it must all mean to the tortured wife he hardly dared to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nOnce when he was there, Carew hurled a tumbler at her which missed her\r\nhead by a hair's-breadth.  Dale got her out of the room, and turned and\r\ngave his patient a sound verbal drubbing, and Carew cursed him high and\r\nlow till his breath gave out.\r\n\r\n\"Has he done that before?\" the Doctor asked the white-faced wife, when\r\nhe had followed her downstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.  But I'm generally on the look-out.  I was off my guard\r\nbecause you were there.  Oh, I wish he would die and leave us in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll kill himself if he goes on like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll kill some of us first.  He's wanting to die.  It would be the\r\nbest thing for him--and for us.  Can't you let him die?\" and a tiny\r\nspark shot through the shadowy suffering of her eyes as she glanced up\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't.  Don't talk like that!\" he said brusquely, and then,\r\nto atone for the brusqueness, \"I am sorely distressed for you, but\r\nthere is nothing to be done but bear it as bravely as you can.  What\r\nabout your mother?  Couldn't you----\"\r\n\r\n\"It would only make him worse still, if that is possible.  Pasley\r\ndetests her.  Oh, I wish I were dead myself.  I cannot bear it,\" and\r\nshe broke into hysterical weeping, and swayed blindly, and would have\r\nfallen if he had not caught her.\r\n\r\nA woman's grief and tears always drew the whole of Wulf's sympathy.\r\nAnd he and she had been almost as brother and sister all their\r\nlives--till she married Carew.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Elinor!  Don't!\" he said soothingly, as with her shaking head\r\nagainst his breast she sobbed as though her heart were broken.\r\n\r\nMollie, the maid, came hastily in, without so much as a knock, her red\r\nface mottled with white fear.\r\n\r\n\"He's going on that awful, Ma'am, I vow I daresn't stop in there alone\r\nwith him.  It's as much as one's life's worth when he's in his\r\ntantrums.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get your mistress a glass of wine, Mollie, and then find young Job and\r\nsend him up.  I'll go up and wait with Mr Carew till he comes.\"\r\n\r\nHe led Mrs Carew to the couch and made her lie down there, and\r\nexplained matters to the girl by asking her,\r\n\r\n\"Does he throw things at you too?\"\r\n\r\n\"La, yes, Doctor, at all of us, if we don't keep 'em out of his reach.\r\nHe do boil up so at nothing at all,\" and she went off in search of\r\nyoung Job, who was passing a peaceful holiday hour in the company of\r\nthirty couple of yelping hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nDale was confronted with the problem with which every medical man comes\r\nface to face during his career.\r\n\r\nHere was a man who, both for his own sake and still more for the sake\r\nof those about him, would be very much better dead than living; who\r\nwanted to die, and, as he believed, make an end; who begged constantly\r\nfor the relief of death;--and yet, against his own equally strong\r\nfeeling of what would be best for all concerned, his doctor must do his\r\nvery utmost to keep his patient alive and all about him in torment.\r\n\r\nWulfrey wished, as devoutly as the more immediate sufferers, that he\r\nwould die.  He wished it more ardently each time he saw Mrs Carew, and\r\nwholly and entirely on her account.\r\n\r\nHer white face, which grew more deathly white each day, and her woful\r\neyes, which grew ever more despairing in their shadowy rings, were sure\r\nindexes of what she was passing through.  Dale wondered how much longer\r\nshe would be able to stand it.\r\n\r\nHe gave her tonics, and his most helpful sympathy and encouragement.\r\nAnd at the same time, by the irony of circumstance and the claims of\r\nhis profession, he must do everything in his power to perpetuate the\r\nburden under which she was breaking.\r\n\r\nBut the whole matter came to a sudden and unlooked for end, on the\r\nseventh day after the accident.\r\n\r\nWulfrey was hastening up to the Hall to clear this, the unpleasantest\r\nitem, out of his day's work, when he met young Job coming down the\r\ndrive with a straw in his mouth and three couples of young hounds at\r\nhis heels.\r\n\r\n\"Wur comen fur you, Doctor,\" said young Job.  \"He's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" jerked the Doctor in very great surprise, for his patient had\r\nbeen more venomously alive than ever the night before.\r\n\r\n\"Ay--dead.  An' a good thing too, say I, and so too says everyone\r\nthat's heard it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what took him, Job?  He was going on all right last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twere the Devil I expecs, Doctor, if you ask me straight.  He were\r\ngetten too strampageous to live.  Th' air were so full o' fire and\r\nbrimstone with his curses, it weren't safe.  'Twere like bein' under a\r\ntree wi' th' leeghtnin' playin' all round.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mrs Carew? ... Who was with him when he died?  Tell me all you\r\nknow about it,\" as they hurried along.\r\n\r\n\"I come up at ten o'clock as ushal, an' the missus met me at door wi'\r\nher finger to her lips.  'He's sleeping, Job,' she says, an' glad I was\r\nto hear it.  'I'll go an' lie down, Job, for I'm very tired,' she says,\r\nand she looked it, poor thing.  'Knock on my door if you need me, Job,'\r\nshe says, and she went away.  He were lying quiet and all tucked up,\r\nan' I sat down an' waited for him to wake up and start again.  But he\r\nnever woke, and when the missus came in this morning she went and\r\nlooked at him, and she says, 'Why, Job, I do believe he's dead,' and I\r\nwent and looked at him, and, God's truth, he looked as if he might be.\r\nBut I couldn't be sure, not liking to touch him, and I says, 'No such\r\nluck, ma'am, _I_'m afraid,'--polite like, for we all knows the time\r\nshe's had wi' him, and she says, 'Go and fetch Dr Dale.'  So I just\r\nloosed these three couple o' young uns--they're all achin' for a\r\nrun,--an' I'm wondering who'll work th' pack now he's gone, if so be as\r\nhe's really gone, which I'm none too sure of.  Th' Hunt were best thing\r\nhe ever did, but he were terrible hard on his horses.\"\r\n\r\nDale hurried into the house and up the stair, and into the sick-room,\r\nthe windows of which were opened to their widest, as though to cleanse\r\nthe room of the fire and brimstone which had seemed over-strong even to\r\nsuch a pachyderm as young Job.\r\n\r\nCarew lay there on the bed, at rest at last, as far as this world was\r\nconcerned, startlingly quiet after the storm-furies of the last seven\r\ndays and nights.\r\n\r\nDale was still standing looking down at him, full of that\r\never-recurring wonder at the quiet dignity which Death sometimes\r\nimparts even to those whose lives have not been dignified; full too of\r\nanxious desire to learn how it had come about.\r\n\r\nThe tightly-clenched hands and livid rigidity of the body suggested a\r\nstartling possibility.  He was bending down to the dead man to\r\ninvestigate more closely when a sound behind him caused him to look\r\nround, and he found Mrs Carew standing there.  Her face was whiter, her\r\neyes heavier and more shadowy, than he had ever seen them.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"One can only look upon it as a merciful release--for all of you.  How\r\nwas it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to die,\" she began, in the dull level tone of a child\r\nrepeating an obnoxious lesson.  Then the self-repression she had\r\nprescribed for herself gave way somewhat.  Her hands gripped one\r\nanother fiercely and she hurried on with a touch of rising hysteria,\r\nbut still speaking in little more than a whisper.  \"You know how he\r\nwanted to die.  He was asking you all the time to give him something to\r\nend it.  But you could not.  I know--I quite understand--being a\r\ndoctor, of course you could not.  But there was something he kept--for\r\nthe rats, you know, in the stables.  And he told me where it was and\r\ntold me to get some.  So I got it and gave it him in his\r\nsleeping-draught, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!  Elinor!...\" he gasped.  \"... You never did that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.  Why not?  He wished it.  We all wished it.  It is much\r\nbetter so,\" and she pointed at the dead man on the bed.  \"It is better\r\nfor him ... and for all of us.  I only did what he told me.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood staring at her in blankest amazement, and found himself\r\nunconsciously searching her face and eyes for signs of aberration.  Her\r\nface was wan-white still, but had lost the broken, beaten look it had\r\nworn of late.  The shadow-ringed eyes were perfectly steady and had in\r\nthem a curious wistful look, like that of a child expecting and\r\ndeprecating a scolding.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what it means?\" he asked at last, in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"It means release for us all,\" she said quickly, and then more quickly\r\nstill, \"Oh, Wulfrey, I couldn't help thinking--hoping\r\nthat--sometime--not for a long time, of course,--but sometime--when we\r\nhave forgotten all this--you might--you and I might----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he said sternly.  \"Were you thinking that when you did this?\"\r\nand he pointed to the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Not then--at least--no, I think not.  I just did what he told me to\r\ndo.  But when I saw he was really dead----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped her again with a gesture, and broke out with brusque\r\nvehemence, \"Is it possible you don't understand what you have done?  Do\r\nyou know what the law will call it?\"----\r\n\r\n\"The law?  No one needs to know anything about it but you and me----\"\r\n\r\n\"The law will want to know how this man died----\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can tell them all that is necessary.  It was Blackbird falling\r\nat the old road that killed him.  If he hadn't broken his back he\r\nwouldn't have been lying here, and if he hadn't----\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have lived for twenty years,\" he said, breaking her off short\r\nagain with an abrupt gesture.  \"The law requires of me the exact truth.\r\nDo you understand you are asking me to swear to a lie?  I would not do\r\nit to save my own life.\"\r\n\r\n\"He took it himself----\"\r\n\r\n\"He could not get it himself, and the law will hold you responsible for\r\nsupplying it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--Wulfrey! ... You won't let them hang me?\"--and he saw that at last\r\nshe understood clearly enough the peril in which she stood if the whole\r\ntruth of the matter became known.\r\n\r\nHang her they most certainly would if the facts got out, or coop her\r\nfor life in a mad-house, which would be infinitely worse than hanging.\r\nAnd the thought of either dreadful ending to her spoiled life was very\r\nterrible to him.\r\n\r\nShe stood before him, little more than a girl still, woful, wistful,\r\nwith terror now in her white face and shadowy eyes, and he remembered\r\ntheir bygone days together.\r\n\r\n\"Go back to your room, and rest, if you can.  And say nothing of all\r\nthis to anyone.  You understand?--not a word to anyone.  I must think\r\nwhat can be done,\" he said, and she turned and went without a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale thought hard and deep.\r\n\r\nHe must save her if he could.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nFor a moment--inevitably--he weighed in his mind the question of his\r\nown honour versus this woman's life.\r\n\r\nWith a few strokes of the pen he could probably bury the whole matter\r\nsafely out of sight along with Carew's dead body.  But those few\r\nstrokes of the pen, certifying that this man died as the result of his\r\naccident, were as impossible to him as would have been the\r\nadministration of the poisoned draught itself.\r\n\r\nMoreover--though that weighed nothing with him compared with the\r\nother--there was in them always the possibility of disaster, should\r\nrumour or tittle-tattle cast the shadow of doubt upon his statement;\r\nand an idle word from Mollie or young Job might easily do that.  The\r\nneighbours also had made constant enquiry after Pasley since his\r\naccident, and had been given to understand that he was progressing as\r\nwell as could be expected.  His sudden death might well cause comment.\r\nIndeed, it would be strange if it did not.  That might lead to\r\ninvestigation, and that must inevitably disclose the fact that he died\r\nfrom strychnine poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe Dales had never been wealthy, but their standards had been high,\r\nand Wulfrey had never done anything to lower them.  He could not sell\r\nhis honour even for this woman's life.\r\n\r\nHe pitied her profoundly.  He understood her better probably than any\r\nother.  He knew how terribly she had suffered, and could comprehend,\r\nquite clearly, just how she had fallen into this horrible pit.  But\r\ncast his honour to the dogs for her, he could not.\r\n\r\nThen how?\r\n\r\nAnd, pondering heavily all possibilities, he saw the only feasible way\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt meant almost certain ruin to himself and his prospects, but, if it\r\ncame, it would be clean ruin and he would feel no smirch.\r\n\r\nIt involved a false statement of fact, it is true, but of a very\r\ndifferent cast and calibre from the other, and one that he himself felt\r\nto be no stain upon his honour.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of pure ethics a lie is a lie, and of course indefensible.\r\nI simply tell you what this man did and felt himself untarnished in the\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nAnd the very first thing he did was to go straight home to the little\r\ndispensary which opened off his consulting-room, and alter the\r\npositions of some of the bottles on the shelves; and from one of them\r\nhe withdrew a measured dose which he tossed out of the window into the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down at his desk and quietly wrote out a certificate of the\r\ndeath of Pasley Carew, of Croome Hall, Gentleman, through the\r\nadministration of a dose of strychnine in mistake for distilled water,\r\nin a sleeping-draught compounded by Dr Wulfrey Dale.  And he thought,\r\nas he wrote the word, of the awful pandemonium Pasley Carew, Gentleman,\r\nhad created in his own household these last seven days.\r\n\r\nHe enclosed this in a covering letter to Dr Tamplin, the coroner, in\r\nwhich he explained more fully how the mistake had occurred.  The\r\nbottles containing the strychnine and the distilled water stood side by\r\nside on his shelf.  He had come in tired from a long country round.\r\nHad remembered the draught to be sent up to the Hall.  As to the rest,\r\nhe could not tell how he came to make such a mistake.  But there it\r\nwas, and he only was to blame.  He could only express his profound\r\nregret and accept the consequences.\r\n\r\nThen, having completed his documents, instead of galloping off to see\r\nhis waiting patients, he sat down before the fire and let his thoughts\r\nplay gloomily over the whole matter.  His man was off delivering\r\nmedicines, and would not be back till midday.  Time enough if Tamplin\r\ngot his letter during the afternoon.  As to his own patients, he had\r\nrun rapidly over them in his own mind, and saw that there was no one\r\nvitally demanding his attention.  He could not go his rounds and say\r\nnothing, and the thought of carrying the news of his own default was\r\ntoo much for him.  As soon as the matter got bruited about, he thought\r\ngrimly, there would probably be a run on Dr Newman's services, which\r\nwould greatly astonish and delight that gentleman and would compensate\r\nhim for all his months of weary waiting.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing for Elinor, he thought, as he sat staring into the\r\nfire, that he was not married.  If he had had a wife and children, they\r\nmust have gone into the scale against her, and she must certainly have\r\nbeen hanged.\r\n\r\nQuite impossible to bring it in as an accident on her part.  That he\r\nhad seen at a glance.  The jury would be composed of neighbours, and in\r\nspite of the placid face she had turned to the world, it was well\r\nenough known that she and Pasley had not lived happily together.  And\r\nthough the fault of that was not imputed to her, every man's thought\r\nwould inevitably jump to the worst, and condemn her even before she did\r\nit out of her own mouth, which she most certainly would do the moment\r\nshe opened it to explain matters.\r\n\r\nNo, this was the only possible way.  If the cost was heavy, he was more\r\ncapable of bearing it than she.  In any case he could not hand her over\r\nto the hangman.  That was out of the question.\r\n\r\nHe could pretty well forecast the consequences.  His practice would be\r\nruined, for who would trust a doctor capable of so fatal a mistake?  He\r\nwould have to go away and start life afresh elsewhere.  It would have\r\nto be somewhere where he was quite unknown, or this thing would dog him\r\nall his life.  Some new country perhaps,--say Canada or the States.\r\nGad, it was a heavy price to pay for a foolish woman's lapse!\r\n\r\nHe would not be penniless, of course.  His father had laid by a\r\nconsiderable sum in the course of his long and busy life.  If necessary\r\nhe could live in quiet comfort, without working, for the rest of his\r\ndays.  But it was hard to break away like this from all that had so far\r\nconstituted his life.  A heavy price to pay for mere sentiment--but not\r\ntoo heavy for a woman's life!\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of his having to go.  The question was whether he\r\nshould go at once, or wait till there was nothing left to wait for.\r\n\r\nIt would be dismal and weary work waiting.  But going would feel like\r\nbolting, and he had never run from trouble in his life.  As a matter of\r\nfact he had never until now had any serious trouble to face, but now\r\nthat it had come he found himself in anything but a running humour.\r\n\r\nIf there had been anything to fight he would have rejoiced in the melee\r\nand plunged into it with ardour.  But here was nothing to be fought.\r\nBy his own deliberate act he was labelling himself untrustworthy, and\r\nno uttermost striving on his part could rehabilitate him.  For the\r\nessence of healing is faith, and a doctor who has forfeited one's\r\nconfidence is worse than no doctor at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he sent off his man on horseback with the letter to Dr\r\nTamplin, and towards evening he came galloping back with this very\r\ncharacteristic reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR WULFREY,\r\n\r\nShocking business and I'm sorely grieved about whole matter.  Humanum\r\nest errare, but a doctor's not supposed to.  Good thing for us we're\r\nnot always found out.  Could you not bring yourself to certify death as\r\nresult of the accident?  I consider it a mistake to admit the\r\npossibility of such a thing, so d--d damaging to the profession.  And\r\nhave you considered the matter from your own point of view?  Cannot\r\nfail to have bad effect.  Perhaps give that new fellow just the chance\r\nhe's been waiting for.  ---- him!\r\n\r\nThink it over again, my boy, from all points, and be wise.  I return\r\ncertificate.  Your man will tell you all about my fall.  My cob\r\nstumbled over a stone last night and broke me a leg and two ribs.  I'm\r\ntoo heavy for that kind of thing and he's a ---- fool!  But it was very\r\ndark and we're neither of us as young as we were.  For all our sakes I\r\nhope you'll come through this all right.  We can't spare you.  And it\r\nmight come to that.  Remember what silly sheep folks are.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n    THOMAS TAMPLIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJust like the dear, easy-going old boy, fall and all, thought Wulfrey,\r\nand the advice tendered and the course suggested did not greatly\r\nsurprise him.  But he had to make allowances for the old man's age and\r\neasy-goingness, and his lack of detailed knowledge of all the\r\ncircumstances of the case,--how almost impossible it would be to\r\nascribe Carew's death to the accident, even if he could have brought\r\nhimself to do so.\r\n\r\nThe old man's own shelving would add greatly to the unpleasantness of\r\nthe situation, for, as deputy-coroner, he would have to call a jury\r\nhimself, and submit the matter to their consideration and himself to\r\ntheir verdict.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no way out of that, so he set to work at once and\r\nsent out his summonses, calling the inquest for ten o'clock the next\r\nmorning, at the Hall; and to relieve Elinor as much as possible, he\r\ngave orders to the undertaker at Brentham to do all that was necessary,\r\nand sent her word that he had done so.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, before he was up, young Job was knocking on his\r\nfront door, with half the pack yelping and leaping outside the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Job?  What's it now?\" he asked, from his bedroom window.\r\n\r\n\"That gal Mollie says you better come up and see th' missus----\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  What's wrong with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ d'n know, n' more don't Mollie.  _She_ thinks she's had a stroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait five minutes and I'll go back with you,\" and in five minutes they\r\nwere crunching through the lanes, all hard underfoot with frost that\r\nlay like snow, and white and gay with hedge-row lacery of spiders' webs\r\nin feathery festoons, and, up above, a crimson sun rising slowly\r\nthrough the mist-banks over the bare black trees.\r\n\r\n\"What makes Mollie think your mistress has had a stroke?\" asked the\r\nDoctor.  \"What does Mollie know about strokes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I d'n know.  'Sims to me she've had a stroke,' was her very words.\r\nShe've just laid on her bed all day an' all night without speakin' a\r\nword, Mollie says,--eatin' noth'n, and drinkin' noth'n, which is\r\nonnat'ral; an' sayin' noth'n, which in a woman is onnat'ral too.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was quite worn out with nursing Mr Carew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like enough.  He _wur_ a handful an' no mistake.  Th' house is a deal\r\nquieter wi'out him.  But who's goin' to run th' pack?--that's what\r\nbothers me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry, Job.  Someone will turn up to run the pack all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe, but it depends on who 'tis.  Why not yourself now, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a great compliment, Job, and I appreciate it.  But,\" with a\r\nshake of the head, \"I'll have other work to do,\" and he wondered grimly\r\nwhere that work might lie.\r\n\r\nMollie took him straight up to Mrs Carew's room, where she lay just as\r\nshe had sunk down on the bed when he sent her away the previous morning.\r\n\r\n\"She's nivver spoke nor moved since she dropped down there yes'day,\"\r\nwhispered Mollie impressively.  \"I covered her up, but she took no\r\nnotice.  An' I brought her up her dinner and her supper but she's never\r\nate a bite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get me a cup of hot milk with an egg and a glass of sherry beaten up\r\nin it, Mollie,\" he whispered back.  \"And I'll see if I can induce her\r\nto take it.  You did quite right to send for me,\" and Mollie hurried\r\naway with a more hopeful face.\r\n\r\nElinor lay there with her eyes closed and a rigid, stricken look on her\r\nwhite face, a picture of hopeless despair.  But Wulfrey's quick glance\r\nhad caught the flutter of her heavy lids, and the gleam of terrified\r\nenquiry that had shot through them, as they came into the room, and he\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her and whispered, \"I have made it all right, Elinor.  You\r\nneed have no further fears----\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not hang me?\" she whispered, and looked up into his face\r\nwith all the terrors of the night still in her woful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"No one will know anything about it unless you tell them yourself.  You\r\nwill eat something now, and then you had better lie still.  Get some\r\nsleep if you can or you will make yourself ill.  If you fell ill you\r\nmight say things you should not, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe struggled up on to one elbow.  \"You are quite sure they will not\r\nhang me?\" she whispered again.\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure, unless you are so foolish as to tell them all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have felt the rope round my neck all night.  Oh, it was terrible in\r\nthe dark.  It was terrible ... terrible----\" and she felt about her\r\npretty white neck with her trembling hands.\r\n\r\n\"Forget all about it now.  I have made all the necessary arrangements.\r\nThere will have to be an inquest.  It will be held here---\"\r\n\r\n\"Here?\" she shivered.\r\n\r\n\"At ten o'clock this morning.  You are too ill to be present, so you\r\nwill just lie still.  It will not take long.  And I have done\r\neverything else that had to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very good of you,\" she murmured, with a forlorn shake of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nShe did not ask by what means he had saved her from the consequences of\r\nwhat she had done.  Perhaps she dared not.  Perhaps she believed he\r\nhad, after all, forsworn himself for her sake, and refrained from\r\nquestioning him lest it should only add to his discomfort.  Anyway she\r\nwas satisfied with the fact.  She was not going to be hanged.  That was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nMollie came in with her deftly-compounded cup.\r\n\r\n\"Drink it up,\" said the Doctor.  \"I will look in again later on,\" and\r\nhe went away to prepare the household for the coming meeting in the big\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe sixteen jurymen, whom Wulfrey had summoned in order to make quite\r\nsure of a legal panel, came riding up in ones and twos, with faces\r\ntuned to the occasion, disguising, as well as they could, the vast\r\ncuriosity this sudden call had excited in themselves and all their\r\nvarious households.\r\n\r\nThat there was something gravely unusual behind it they could not but\r\nfeel.  They were all friends and neighbours; many of them had witnessed\r\nCarew's accident and had been constant in their enquiries as to his\r\nprogress.  The news of his death had come as a surprise and a shock,\r\nand such of them as happened to join company on the road discussed the\r\nmatter by fits and starts, and surreptitiously as it were, but did not\r\nventure below the surface.  Their women-folk at home had done all that\r\nwas necessary in that respect for the fullest ventilation of the\r\nsubject, without in any degree rendering it more savoury or\r\ncomprehensible.\r\n\r\nEvery man had felt it his bounden duty to be there, and so it was\r\nsixteen keenly interested faces that confronted Wulfrey when he took\r\nthe chair at the head of the table and stood up to speak to them.\r\n\r\nHis face was very grave, his manner noticeably quiet and restrained and\r\nvery different from its usual jovial frankness.\r\n\r\n\"This painful duty, doubly painful under the circumstances, as you will\r\nunderstand in a moment, has fallen to me in consequence of Dr Tamplin\r\nbeing laid up through the fall of his horse yesterday.  I am sure you\r\nwill not make it any more painful for me than it is.  I shall not\r\ntrouble you long.  The matter is unfortunately clear and simple.  Our\r\nfriend, Mr Pasley Carew, died the night before last from the effects of\r\na dose of strychnine, administered in a sleeping-draught in mistake for\r\ndistilled water which was in the bottle alongside it on the shelf in my\r\ndispensary.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes ranged keenly over the startled faces round the table at which\r\nthey had all of them so often sat,--under which some of them had not\r\ninfrequently lain.\r\n\r\nEvery face was alight with startled surprise.  Not one of them showed\r\nthe remotest sign of questioning his statement.\r\n\r\nIndeed, why should they?  A man does not as a rule confess to so grave\r\na lapse unless it is absolutely unavoidable, unless the truth must out\r\nand there is no possible loophole of escape.\r\n\r\nNot many men would fling away their life's prospects from simple pity\r\nfor a woman.  For love--yes, without a doubt, and count the cost small.\r\nBut from simple pity, in remembrance of the time when the greater love\r\nhad been possible? ...\r\n\r\nBut no such idea found place in any of their minds.  His eyes searched\r\ntheirs for smallest flicker of doubt, but found none.  Whatever the\r\nwomen at home might have suggested as extreme possibilities, these men\r\naccepted his word without a moment's hesitation.  Elinor was perfectly\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n\"He was in great pain and could only get rest and relief by means of\r\nopiates.  How the mistake occurred I cannot explain, except that the\r\nbottles of distilled water and of strychnine stand alongside one\r\nanother on my shelf, and that I had come in very tired that night and\r\nthe sleeping-draught was prepared hurriedly.  I deplore the results\r\nmore than any of you possibly can, and of course I must accept the\r\nconsequences.  I have not judged it necessary to make any post-mortem\r\nexamination.  I was called by young Job early yesterday morning, and\r\nwhen I got here Carew was dead and the symptoms were those of poisoning\r\nby strychnine.  I was amazed and horrified, but when I hurried back\r\nhome I saw at once how the mistake might have been made,\r\nand--and--well, there the matter is and you must bring in such verdict\r\nas you deem right.  You can see the body if you wish.  You can examine\r\nthe servants.  Mrs Carew, I am sorry to say, is quite broken down with\r\nthe shock.  She has been, I am told, practically unconscious for nearly\r\ntwenty-four hours and has only just come to herself.  But if you would\r\nlike to see her----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no.\"  \"No need whatever,\" said the jurymen deprecatingly.\r\n\r\nDr Wulfrey sat down and dropped his head into his hands, then got up\r\nagain heavily and said, \"You will discuss this matter better without\r\nme.  I will leave you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you possibly say he died as result of the accident, Wulf?\"\r\nasked one--Jim Barclay of Breme.\r\n\r\nThey all liked the Doctor.  With some he had been on terms of very\r\nclose friendship.  Some of them had known him all his life and his\r\nfather before him.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, couldn't you?\" chorussed some of the others.\r\n\r\n\"If I could I should have done so,\" he said quietly.  \"But it wasn't so\r\nand I couldn't say it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say it now, Wulf,\" urged his friend.  \"And I swear none of us will let\r\nit out.  Isn't that so, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\"--but somewhat dubiously from the older members, who saw that\r\nafter this revelation of the actual facts to themselves their relations\r\nwith the Doctor could never be quite the same again, however they might\r\nsucceed in hoodwinking the world outside.\r\n\r\nThey knew him, they liked him, but--well, at the back of their minds\r\nwas the thought that if Dr Wulf could make a mistake in one case, there\r\nwas no knowing but what he might in another,--that he might at any time\r\ncome in tired and pick up the wrong bottle,--that, whatever risks one\r\nmight accept on one's own account for old friendship's sake, one's wife\r\nand daughters should hardly be put into such a position all unknown to\r\nthemselves.  And more than one of them wondered what he would do if he\r\nshould happen to be taken ill that night--send for Dr Wulf or the new\r\nman down in the village?\r\n\r\nDale diagnosed their symptoms with the sensitiveness born of the\r\nequivocal nature of the new relationship in which his confession placed\r\nhim towards them.\r\n\r\n\"It is like your good-heartedness to suggest it, Barclay,\" he said to\r\nhis impetuous friend, \"but it cannot be.  I can only do what seems to\r\nme right,\" and he left them to talk over their verdict.\r\n\r\n\"Gad! but I'm mighty sorry this has happened,\" said one old squire who\r\nhad known Wulf from the year one.  \"Many's the time I've sat at this\r\ntable----\"\r\n\r\n\"And under it,\" interjected one.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and under it, and I never expected to sit round it on Pasley\r\nCarew.  I'd give a year's rents to have him back, even if he was all in\r\npieces and raging like the Devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here.  Whatever we decide it'll get out, and it's bound to tell\r\nagainst Dr Wulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's bound to suffer,--can't help it,--it's human nature.  Suppose you\r\ntook ill tonight now, Barclay.  What would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would I do?  I'd send for Wulf Dale of course, and I'd have same\r\nfaith in him as I've always had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\"--but even those who said it had more the air of\r\nwishing to placate Barclay, who had a temper, rather than of any deep\r\nconviction as to their own course should the unfortunate necessity\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Barclay, with the manner of a volcano on the point of\r\neruption.  \"All I can say is that if any man I know goes ill and does\r\nnot send for Wulf Dale, he'll have me to reckon with if the other man\r\ndoesn't kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" from various points about the table.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've got to decide something and make an end of the matter,\"\r\nsaid one.  \"Barclay, you write out what you think and I've no doubt\r\nwe'll all agree to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to write nothing,\" said Barclay, whose strong brown hand was\r\nmore accustomed to the hunting-crop than the pen.  \"I say 'Accidental\r\nDeath,' and keep your mouths shut.\"\r\n\r\nThey all said 'Accidental Death' and promised to keep their mouths\r\nshut; and Wulfrey, when he was called in, thanked theta soberly for\r\ntheir good intentions, but added to their verdict,--\"as the result of\r\nstrychnine poison administered in mistake for distilled water in a\r\nsleeping-draught prepared by Dr Wulfrey Dale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nJim Barclay, who was a bachelor, kept his bed next morning with an\r\nalleged bad cold,---a thing he had never been troubled with in all his\r\nborn days, and ostentatiously sent his man galloping for Dr Wulfrey as\r\nthough his master's life depended on it.\r\n\r\nWulfrey smiled at the message, understanding the staunch friendliness\r\nwhich lay behind it, and went.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's wrong with you?\" he enquired of the burly patient, when\r\nhe was shown up to his bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"Just you, my boy.  Haven't slept a wink all night for thinking of the\r\nwhole ---- mess.  Wulf, my lad, I'm afraid you'll have a deuce an' all\r\nof a time of it.  Thought I'd show 'em there was one man thought none\r\nthe worse of you.  ----!  ----!  ----!  Can't any man make a little\r\nmistake like that?  Trouble is, most of those other fools have got a\r\npack of yelping women-folk about 'em, and they're all on the quee-vee\r\nand as keen on the scent as any old----,\" and he launched into\r\ncomparisons drawn from the kennels into which we need not enter.  \"They\r\nall promised not to blab, and they'll none of 'em tell any but their\r\nwives under promise of secrecy, and it'll be all over the country-side\r\nin a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, old man.  I've just got to stand it,\" said Dale soberly.\r\n\r\n\"What's in your mind then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll just wait quietly and see what comes.  I can't expect things to\r\nbe as they were before.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if things go badly?  ---- ---- ---- it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm thinking I'll go too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, right away.  America maybe, or Canada.  It's a big country they\r\nsay and just beginning to open up.  I shan't starve anyway, wherever I\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,--to leave us all and all this?  ---- ---- ---- it all, man!  The\r\nplace won't be like itself without you.  ---- Pasley Carew!\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't his fault, you know----\"\r\n\r\n\"It was his ---- fault putting Blackbird at that ---- Old Road after\r\nthe run we'd had, wasn't it?  I told him he was two stone too heavy for\r\nher.  But he always was a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was to blame there undoubtedly.  But the rest I take to myself.  If\r\nfolks go to the other man I can't blame them.  I shall go nowhere\r\nunless I'm sent for.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have a ---- long holiday,\" growled Barclay.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can do with one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've half a mind to have a smash-up just to keep your hand in.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do I'll--I'll turn the other man on to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he puts his nose in here he'll go out faster than he came, I wager\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nIt was comforting to have so whole-hearted a supporter; but one\r\npatient, and a sham one at that, does not make a practice, and Dale\r\nvery soon felt the effects of the course he had chosen.\r\n\r\nHe adhered resolutely to the decision he had come to to visit none of\r\nhis patients unless he were sent for.  It would be neither fair to them\r\nnor agreeable to himself.  It might do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nAs to Mrs Carew,--he had visited her immediately after the inquest, and\r\ntold her briefly that all was right and she need have no further fears.\r\nThere was nothing wrong with her which a few days' rest and the relief\r\nof her mind would not set right.  All the same he rather feared she\r\nmight send for him, and he debated in his own mind whether, if she did\r\nso, he should go or send her messenger on to Dr Newman.  It appeared to\r\nhim hardly seemly that the man who had accepted the responsibility for\r\nthe death of the husband should continue his attendance on his widow.\r\n\r\nShe did not of course as yet know the facts of the case as outsiders\r\ndid.  He was somewhat doubtful of the effect upon her when she came to\r\na clear understanding of the matter.  On the whole, he decided it would\r\nbe better if possible not to see her again.  What he had done for her\r\nhad been done out of pity, but it was not the pity that sometimes leads\r\nto warmer feeling.  All that had died a natural death when she married\r\nCarew.\r\n\r\nHe attended the funeral with the rest.  It would only have made comment\r\nif he had not.  And Jim Barclay and most of the others were at pains to\r\nmanifest their continued friendliness and confidence.\r\n\r\nWhether the full facts had got out he could not tell, but, rightly or\r\nwrongly, imagined so, and for the second time in his life he found\r\nhimself ill at ease among his neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe day after the funeral, young Job and a bunch of lively dogs came\r\ndown again with an urgent message from Mrs Carew requesting him to call.\r\n\r\n\"Is your mistress worse, Job?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"She be main bad, Doctor, 'cording to that gal Mollie, but what 'tis I\r\ndunnot know.  Mebbe she's just down wi' it all.  Have ye heard ony talk\r\nyet as t' who's going to tek on th' pack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Barclay will, I believe.  He's a good man for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, he may do.  Bit heavy, mebbe, an' he's got a temper 'bout as bad\r\nas Pasley's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bit hot perhaps at times, but he's an excellent fellow at bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that, and his cussin' ain't to compare wi' Pasley's, which is a\r\ngood thing.  I c'n stand a reasonable amount o' cussin' myself and no\r\noffence taken, but Pasley did go past th' mark at times.  Th' very\r\nhosses kicked when he let out.  An' Jim Barclay he is good to his\r\nhosses, an' he only cusses when he must or bust.  Ay, he'll do, seein'\r\nyou won't tek it on yourself, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not for me, Job.  A doctor's time is not entirely his own, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Job, and picked a twig from the hedge, and stuck it in his\r\nmouth, and trudged on in solemn silence.\r\n\r\n\"We wus rather hopin', feyther an' me,\" he grunted after a time, \"you'd\r\nmebbe have more time now fur th' pack an' would tek it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why that, Job?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, y' see, it'll mek a difference this.  It's bound to mek a\r\ndifference.  Folks is such silly fools 'bout such things----\"\r\n\r\n\"What things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that there strychnine.  'S if anyone couldn't mek a li'l mistake\r\nlike that.  Might have sense to know ye'd never let it happen again.\r\nEven th' leeghtnin', they say, never strikes twice i' same place.\r\nThough sure 'nuff it did hit th' old mill one side one day and t'other\r\nside next day.  But even then 'twere opposite sides.  But folks is\r\nfools.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you know all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure!  'Twere that gal Mollie told me, an' it were Mrs Thelstane's\r\ngal Bet told her.  None o' us think a bit the worse o' you, Doctor, you\r\nb'lieve me.  But some folks is fools--most folks, if it comes to\r\nthat....  An' as to Pasley--well, he were a terror now'n again.  Th'\r\nHall's like Heaven wi'out him.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on again in silence for a time.  But there was that in young\r\nJob's mind which had to come out.\r\n\r\n\"If 'twere me, Doctor, askin' your pardon in advance for bein' so bold,\r\nwhat I'd do would be this.  I'd just sit quiet till they done yelpin'\r\nand yappin' 'bout it all, then I'd marry th' missus,--we all knows you\r\nwas sweet on her once,--and settle down comfortable at th' Hall and tek\r\nover th' pack an' mek us all happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's out of the question, Job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it now? ... Well, I'm sorry.  Wus hopin' mebbe a word of advice\r\nfrom a man what's old enough to be your feyther, an's known you since\r\nday you was born, might be o' some use to ye.  We'd like you fain well\r\nfor Master, both o' th' Hall an' th' Hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a good old chap, Job, and so's your father, but you'll both be\r\ndoing me a favour if you'll stop any talk of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"No manner o' use?\"\r\n\r\n\"No use at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm main sorry.  An' so's feyther, I can tell ye.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Carew was sitting in a large chintz-covered armchair before the\r\nfire in her bedroom, when he was taken up to her by Mollie, who\r\nfavoured him with her own diagnosis as they mounted the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"She's that bad again.  Can't sleep and off her food.  Ain't had hardly\r\nanything all day or yes'day.  Just sits 'fore th' fire and mopes from\r\nmorn'n till night.  'Taint natural for sure, for him 'at's gone weren't\r\none to cry for, that's cert'n....  No, she don't complain of any pain\r\nor anything.  Just sits and mopes and cries on the quiet 's if her\r\nheart was broke.  Sure she'd more cause to cry before he was took than\r\nwhat she has now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the room he did not at first see her, so sunk down was\r\nshe in the depths of the great ear-flapped chair.\r\n\r\nShe made no attempt to rise and greet him.  When he stood beside her\r\nand quietly expressed his regret at finding her no better, she covered\r\nher face with her hands and sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\nShe looked little more than a girl, slight and frail and forlorn, as\r\nshe crouched there with hidden face, and he was truly sorry for her.\r\nIt was impossible for him to keep the sympathy he felt entirely out of\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Mrs Carew?\" he asked quietly, and the forlorn\r\nfigure shook again but made no response.\r\n\r\n\"You are doing yourself harm with all this,\" he said gently again.\r\n\"And there is really no occasion for it, that I can see.\"\r\n\r\nHer silent extremity of grief--her utter discomfiture was pitiful to\r\nlook upon.  It touched him profoundly, for he penetrated the meaning of\r\nit.  She was overwhelmed with the knowledge of the sacrifice he had\r\nmade for her--and with pity for herself.\r\n\r\nAll he could do was to wait quietly till the feeling, roused afresh by\r\nhis presence, had spent itself.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not know,\" she whispered at last, through the shielding\r\nhands.  \"I did not know you would do that....  You have ruined\r\nyourself....  You should have let them hang me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there and then, on the spur of the moment, he leaped up a height\r\nwhich he had not even sighted a second before.\r\n\r\nHe had, by the sacrifice of his prospects, saved her from the legal\r\nconsequences of her act.  That was irrevocably past and done with, and\r\nhe must pay the price.  But she was paying a double due--remorse for\r\nwhat she herself had done, bitter sorrow at the ruinous price he had\r\npaid for her safety.\r\n\r\nHe had saved her life.  Why not save her the rest?--her peace of mind,\r\nall her possibilities of future happiness.\r\n\r\nIn any case it would make no difference to him.  For her it might mean\r\nall the difference between darkness and light for the rest of her life.\r\nAnd she looked pitifully helpless and hopeless as she lay there sobbing\r\nconvulsively in the big chair.\r\n\r\nHe saw the possibility in a flash and gripped it.\r\n\r\n\"Hang you?  Why on earth should anyone want to hang you?\" he asked,\r\nwith all the natural surprise he could put into it.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\"--in a scared whisper.  \"Because I got him the poison----\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come now!  Let us have no more of that.  I was hoping a good\r\nnight's rest would have ridded you of that bad dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dream?\" and she looked up at him wildly.  \"Ah, if I could only believe\r\nit was a dream!\" and she shook her head forlornly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course it was a dream.  You were over-wrought with it all, and\r\nyour mind took the bit in its teeth and ran away with you.  What you've\r\ngot to do now is to try to forget all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget!\"\r\n\r\n\"How I came to make such a mistake I cannot imagine, but when I got\r\nhome I saw at once that there was an extra dose gone out of my\r\nstrychnine bottle instead of out of the distilled water, and that\r\nexplained it at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_? ... _You_ made the mistake?\" she looked up at him again,\r\neagerly, with warped face and knitted brows, and a wavering flutter of\r\nhope in her eyes....  \"You are only saying it to comfort me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying to show you how foolish it is to allow yourself to be\r\nridden by this strange notion you've got into your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange notion? ... Did he not beg me to get him that stuff he used\r\nfor the rats?  And did I not get it for him?  And he took it.  And\r\nthen----\" she shivered at the remembrance of what followed when her\r\nhusband took the draught.\r\n\r\n\"All in that horrible dream when your mind was running away with\r\nyou----\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not come and tell me they would hang me unless I kept my\r\nmouth shut?  And I lay all that dreadful night with the rope round my\r\nneck----\"\r\n\r\n\"All in your dream.  I'm sorry.  It must have been terribly real to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dream?\" and she stared wistfully into the fire, hex hands clasping\r\nand unclasping nervously.  \"If I could believe it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must believe what I tell you, and forget all about it and recover\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" she said after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be all right.  Don't trouble your head about me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I did not do it,\" she said, after another long silent gazing into\r\nthe fire, \"then there would be no need for you to hate me----\"\r\n\r\n\"No need whatever,--all part of that stupid dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ... sometime perhaps ... you would think better of me ... as you\r\nused to do.  Oh,--Wulfrey! ...\"\r\n\r\nIf it had all happened as he had almost persuaded her to believe, he\r\nmight have fallen into his own pit.\r\n\r\nFor, under the stress of her emotions,--the wild hope of the\r\npossibility of relief from the horror that had been weighing her\r\ndown,--the letting in of this thread of sunshine into the blackness of\r\nher despair,--the sudden joy of the thought that it was not she who\r\nneeded Wulfrey's forgiveness, but he hers;--the shadows and the years\r\nfell from her, and she was more like the Elinor Baynard he had once\r\nbeen in love with than he had seen her since the day she married Pasley\r\nCarew.\r\n\r\n\"We must not think of any such things,\" he said quickly, but not\r\nunkindly.  He was very sorry for her, but he was no longer in love with\r\nher.  \"At present all we've got to think about is getting you quite\r\nyourself again.  I will send you up some medicine,--if you won't be\r\nafraid to take it----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Wulfrey! ...\" with all the reproach she could put into it, and\r\nanxiously, \"You will come again soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you get on well perhaps.  If you don't I shall turn you over to Dr\r\nNewman,\" and he left her.\r\n\r\n\"She ain't agoing to die, Doctor?\" asked Mollie, as she waylaid him.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mollie.  She's going to get better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I knew it'd do her good if you came to see her,\" said the astute\r\nhandmaid with an approving look.\r\n\r\n\"Get her to eat and feed her up.  She's been letting herself run down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, she'll eat now maybe, if so be 's you've given her a bit of an\r\nappetite,\" said Mollie hopefully; and Dr Wulfrey went away home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nBut even two patients hardly make a practice, and though from the\r\nstolid commoner folk calls still came for 'th' Doctor's' services, upon\r\nthe better classes a sudden blessing of unusual health appeared to have\r\nfallen, or else----\r\n\r\nDr Newman bought a horse about this time, and, though he did not as yet\r\ncut much of a figure on horseback, it enabled him to get about as he\r\nhad never had occasion to do since he settled in the village, and it\r\nseemed as though, in his case as in others, practice would in time make\r\nhim passable.\r\n\r\nWulfrey watched the course of events quietly and with a certain\r\nequanimity.  His mind was quite made up to go abroad, but he would not\r\ngo till he was satisfied that that was the only course left to him.\r\n\r\nEverybody he met was as friendly as ever, the men especially, but\r\nsickness was a rare thing with them at any time, and their women-folk\r\nseemed to be getting along very well, for the time being without\r\nmedical assistance, so far at all events as Dr Wulfrey Dale was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nMrs Carew was better.  Whatever she really believed as to the actual\r\nfacts of her husband's death, she apparently accepted Dale's statement,\r\nto the great relief of her mind and consequent benefit to her health.\r\nShe sent for the Doctor as often as she reasonably could, and sometimes\r\nwithout any better reason than her desire to see him.  Until at last he\r\ntold her she was perfectly well and he would come no more unless there\r\nwere actual need.\r\n\r\n\"But there is actual need, Wulfrey.  It does me good to see you.  If\r\nyou don't come I shall fall into a low state again.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do I shall know it is simple perversity and I'll send Dr Newman\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mollie would never let him in.\"\r\n\r\nWhich was likely enough, for Mollie's mind was quite made up as to the\r\nonly right and proper course for matters to take under all the present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe March winds brought on a mild epidemic of influenza.\r\n\r\nDr Newman and his new horse were ostentatiously busy.  Wulfrey saw that\r\nhe had waited long enough, and that now it was time to go.  No one\r\ncould accuse him of running away.  It was his practice that had found\r\nits legs and walked over to Dr Newman.\r\n\r\nHe made his arrangements at once and by no means downcastly.  The\r\nhanging-on had been trying.  It was new life to be up and doing, with a\r\nnew world somewhere in front to be discovered and conquered.\r\n\r\nHe packed his trunks, gave Mr Truscott, the lawyer, instructions to\r\ndispose of his house and everything in it except certain specified\r\narticles and pictures, arranged with his bankers at Chester to collect\r\nand re-invest his dividends, drew out a couple of hundred pounds to go\r\non with, told them he was going abroad and they might not hear from him\r\nfor some time to come, and went round to say good-bye to Jim Barclay\r\nand Elinor Carew.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Barclay, when he heard he was off.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever the chase may lead,\" said Wulfrey, in better spirits than he\r\nhad been for many a day.  \"I shall go first to the States and Canada\r\nand have a good look round.  If any place lays hold of me I may settle\r\ndown there.\"\r\n\r\n\"For good and all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.  Can't say till I see what it's like.  I want you to take\r\nGraylock and Billyboy till I come back.  You know all about them.\r\nThere's no one else I'd care to leave 'em with and I don't care to sell\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll miss you, same as the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a week or two, maybe.  Dr Newman is getting into things nicely,\r\nbut you might give him a lesson or two in riding, Jim.\"\r\n\r\n\"---- him, I'd liefer break his back!\" was Barclay's terse comment.\r\n\"You'll let me know where you get to, Wulf, and maybe I'll take a run\r\nover to see you, if you really find it in your heart to settle out\r\nthere.  I'll bring the horses with me if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll let you know.  Fine sporting country, I believe,--bears, wolves,\r\nbuffaloes, game of sorts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye and God bless you, my boy!  Remember there'll always be\r\none man in the old country that wants you.  I'd sooner die than have\r\nthat new man poking round me.  I'll send for old Tom Tamplin, hanged if\r\nI don't.\"\r\n\r\nWulfrey rode on to the Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Going away, Wulf?  Where to and for how long?\" asked Elinor, anxious\r\nand troubled.\r\n\r\n\"That depends.  I've not been up to the mark lately and a good long\r\nchange will set me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have really no plans made, except to get away for a time and see a\r\nbit of the outside world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping ... you would stop and ... sometime, perhaps...\" and the\r\nsmall white hands clasped and unclasped nervously, as was her way when\r\nher mind was upset.\r\n\r\n\"The change I am sure will be good for me.  And you are quite all right\r\nagain.  You are looking better than I've seen you for a long time past.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" she said drearily, \"except that I have bad dreams now\r\nand again.  I cannot be quite sure in my own mind----\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, now!\"--shaking a peremptory finger at her.  \"That is all past and\r\ndone with.  Bad dreams are forbidden, remember!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help their coming.  They come in spite of all my trying at\r\ntimes.  And they are always the same.  I see Pasley lying on the bed,\r\nraging and cursing, and ordering me to go and get him----\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a dream of a dream.  I was hoping you had quite got the\r\nbetter of it.  You must fight against it.  Now I must run.  Got a lot\r\nof things to do yet, and I'm off first thing in the morning.  Good-bye,\r\nElinor,--and all happiness to you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nNO MAN'S LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nWulfrey Dale, as he strolled about the Liverpool docks and basins, felt\r\nvery much like a schoolboy who had run away from home in search of the\r\nwide free life of the Rover of the Seas.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, one vast advantage over the runaway, in that he had\r\nmoney in his pocket and could pick and choose, and there was no angry\r\nmaster or troubled parent on his track to haul him back to bondage.\r\n\r\nHe had no slightest regrets in the matter.  Under all the circumstances\r\nof the case, he said to himself, he could have done nothing else.\r\nElinor, left to herself, would undoubtedly have paid with her life,\r\neither on the gallows or in a mad-house, and that was unthinkable.  The\r\ninexorable Law would have taken no account of the true inwardness of\r\nthe case.  He had saved her because he understood, and because the\r\nalternatives had been too dreadful to think of.\r\n\r\nAs to the cost to himself,--the long blue-green heave of the sea, out\r\nthere beyond the point, made little of that, changed it indeed from one\r\nside of the account to the other, and presented it, not as a loss, but\r\nas very substantial gain.\r\n\r\nOut beyond there lay the world, the vast unknown, the larger life; and\r\nthe windy blue sky streaked with long-drawn wisps of feathery white\r\ncloud, and the tumbling green waves with their crisp white caps, and\r\nthe screaming gulls in their glorious free flight, all tugged at his\r\nheart and called him to the quest.\r\n\r\nAnd these cumbered quays, with their heaps of merchandise, and the\r\njerking ropes and squeaking pulley-blocks that piled them higher and\r\nhigher every moment,--the swaying masts up above and busy decks down\r\nbelow,--the strange foreign smells and flavour of it all,--the rough\r\ntarry-breeks hanging about and spitting jovially in the intervals of\r\nuncouth talk,--all these were but a foretaste of the great change, and\r\nhe savoured them all with vastest enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHe inspected, from a distance, the great clippers that did the voyage\r\nto New York in twenty to twenty-five days, stately and disciplined, in\r\nthe very look of them, as ships of the line almost.\r\n\r\nThere were ships loading and unloading for and from nearly every port\r\nin the world.  It was like being at the centre of a mighty spider's web\r\nwhose arms and filaments reached out to the extremest ends of the\r\nearth.  He had never felt so free in his life before.\r\n\r\nHe was in no pressing hurry to settle on either his port or his ship,\r\nbut in any case it would not be on one of those great packet-boats he\r\nwould go.  His fancy ran rather to something smaller, something more\r\nintimate in itself and less likely to be crowded with passengers whose\r\nacquaintance he had no desire to make.\r\n\r\nHe wandered further among the smaller craft, with a relish in the\r\nsearch that was essentially a part of the new life.  He developed quite\r\na discriminating taste in ships, though it was only by chatting with\r\nthe old salts who lounged about the quay-walls that he learned to\r\ndistinguish a ship from a barque and a brig from a schooner.  His\r\npreferences were based purely on appearances.  The sea-faring qualities\r\nof the various craft were beyond him.\r\n\r\nBut here and there, one and another would attract him by reason of its\r\nlooks, and he would return again and again to compare them with still\r\nlater discoveries, saying to himself, \"Yes, that would do first-rate\r\nnow, if she should happen to be going my way.  We'll see presently.\"\r\n\r\nHe came, in time, upon a brig loading in one of these outer basins, and\r\neven to his untutored eye she was a picture,--so graceful her lines, so\r\ntapering her masts, so trim and taut the whole look of her.\r\n\r\n\"Where does she go to?\" he asked of an old sailor-man, who was sitting\r\non a cask, chewing his quid like an old cow and spitting meditatively\r\nat intervals.\r\n\r\n\"Bawst'n, 'Merica, 's where she's bound this v'y'ge, Mister, an' ef she\r\ndid it in twenty days I shouldn' be a bit s'prised, not a bit, I\r\nshouldn'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-looking boat!  What does she carry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miskellaneous cargo.  Bit o' everything, as you might say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when does she sail?\"'\r\n\r\n\"Fust tide, I reck'n, ef so be's her crew a'n't been ganged.  Finished\r\nloading not ha'f an hour ago she did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she take any passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn' say.  Passenger boats is mostly down yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but I like the look of this one better than the big ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you c'n ask aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?  How can I get on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, down that there ladder,\" and Wulfrey, following the direction of\r\na ponderous roll of the old fellow's head and a squirt of\r\ntobacco-juice, came upon some iron rungs let into a straight\r\nup-and-down groove in the face of the quay-wall.  By going down on his\r\nhands and knees, and making careful play with his feet, he managed at\r\nlast to get on to this apology for a ladder and succeeded in climbing\r\ndown it, over the side of the ship on to its deck.\r\n\r\nThe deck, dirty as it was with the work of loading, felt springy to his\r\nunaccustomed feet.  It was the first ship's deck he had ever trodden.\r\nThe very feel of it was exhilarating.  It was like setting foot on the\r\nbridge that led to the new life.\r\n\r\nAs he looked about him,--at the neatly-coiled ropes, the rope-handled\r\nbuckets, the blue water-casks lashed to the deck below one of the\r\nmasts, the masts themselves, massive below but tapering up into the sky\r\nlike fishing-rods, the mazy network of rigging, four little brass\r\ncarronades and the ship's bell, all polished to the nines and shining\r\nlike gold,--the worries and troubles of the last few months fell from\r\nhim like a ragged garment.  Elinor Carew, and Croome, and Jim Barclay,\r\nand even Graylock and Billyboy, the parting with whom had been as sore\r\na wrench as any, all seemed very far away, things of the past, shadowy\r\nin presence of these stimulating realities of the new life.\r\n\r\nHe walked aft along the deck towards a door under the raised poop, and\r\nat the sound of his coming a man came out of the door and said,\r\n\"Hello!\" and stood and stared at him out of a pair of very deep-set,\r\nsombre black eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, well-built fellow of about Wulfrey's own age,\r\nblack-haired, black-bearded and moustached, and of a somewhat saturnine\r\ncountenance.  His face and neck were the colour of dark mahogany with\r\nmuch sun and weather.  He wore small gold rings in his ears, and\r\nWulfrey set him down for a foreigner,--a Spaniard, he thought, or\r\nperhaps an Italian.\r\n\r\n\"I was told you were sailing tomorrow for Boston,\" said Wulfrey.  \"I\r\ncame to ask if you take passengers.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's black brows lifted a trifle and he took stock of Wulfrey\r\nwhile he considered the question.  Then he said, \"Ay? well, we do and\r\nwe don't,\" and Wulfrey rearranged his ideas as to his nationality and\r\ndecided that he was either Scotch or North of Ireland, though he did\r\nnot look either one or the Other.\r\n\r\n\"That perhaps means that you might.\"\r\n\r\n\"Et's for the auld man to say----\"\r\n\r\n\"The Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Cap'n Bain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where could I see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's up in the toon.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll tell me where to find him I'll go after him.\"\r\n\r\nThe other seemed to turn this over in his mind, and then said, \"Ye'd\r\nbest see him here.  He'll mebbe no be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll wait.  What time do you expect to clear out?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll know when the old man comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would let me see the rooms, while I'm waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe dark man turned slowly and went down three steps into the small\r\nmain cabin.  His leisurely manner suggested no more than a willingness\r\nnot to be disobliging.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair-sized room, with a grated skylight overhead, portholes at\r\nthe sides, seats and lockers below them, and a table with wooden forms\r\nto sit on.  At the far end were two more doors.\r\n\r\n\"Cap'n's bunk and mine,\" said his guide, with a roll of the head\r\ntowards the left-hand door, and opened the other for Wulfrey to look in\r\nat the narrow passage off which opened two small sleeping-rooms.\r\n\r\n\"You are then----?\" asked Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"Mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're Scotch, aren't you?  I took you at first sight for a foreigner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm frae the Islands....  Some folks hold there's mixed blood in some\r\nof us since the times when the Spaniards were wrecked there.  Mebbe!  I\r\nd'n know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Captain Bain?  He's Scotch too, I judge, by his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, he's Scotch--Glesca.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he'll take me as passenger I'll be glad.  This would suit me\r\nuncommonly well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, well.  He'll say when he comes,\" and whenever his black eyes\r\nrested on Wulfrey they seemed to be questioning what it could be that\r\nmade him wish to travel on a trading-brig rather than on a\r\npassenger-liner.\r\n\r\nHowever, he asked no questions but pulled out a black clay pipe, and\r\nWulfrey pulled out his own and anticipated the other's search for\r\ntobacco by handing him his pouch.  They had sat silently smoking for\r\nbut a few minutes when a heavy foot was heard on the deck outside, and\r\nthere came a gruff call for \"Macro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\" and the doorway darkened with the short burly figure of\r\na man whose words preceded him, \"Tom Crimp'll have 'em all here by ten\r\no'clock an' we'll----  Wha the deevil's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wants to go passenger to Boston,\" explained the mate, and left Wulfrey\r\nto his own negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"If you're open to take a passenger, Captain Bain, I've fallen in love\r\nwith the looks of your ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for d'ye no want to go in a passenger-ship?  We're no a\r\npassenger-ship,\" and the Captain eyed him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Just that I dislike travelling with a crowd, I've been looking round\r\nfor some days and your ship pleases me better than any I've seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you from, and what's your name and rating!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm from Cheshire.  Name, Wulfrey Dale.  Rating, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' what for are ye wanting to go to Boston!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going out to look round.  I may settle out there if I find any\r\nplace I like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are ye in trouble?  Poisoned ony one?  Resurrectionist, mebbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither one nor the other.  I've no work here.  I'm going to look for\r\nsome over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can ye pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  I'm not asking you to take me out of charity.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a guid thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much shall we say?  And when do you sail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Et'll be twenty guineas, ped in advance, an' ef ye want ony victuals\r\nbeyant what the ship provides, which is or'nary ship's fare same as me\r\nand the mate eats, ye'll provide 'em yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Understood!  And you sail----\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night's flood, ef the men get aboard all safe.  They're promised me\r\nfor ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pay you now and go up for my things.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' whaur may they be?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Cotton's, in Castle Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aweel!  Juist keep a quiet tongue in your heid, Doctor, as to the ship\r\nye're sailing on.  The 'Grassadoo' doesna tak passengers, ye ken, an' I\r\ndinna want it talked aboot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.  I've only got a box and a bag, but I'll have to get a\r\nman to carry them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--weel!\" and after a moment's consideration, \"You wait at Cotton's\r\nan' we'll send Jock Steele, the carpenter, up for them at eight\r\no'clock.  Ye can coach or truck 'em as far as he says and carry 'em\r\nbetween you the rest.\"\r\n\r\nSo Wulfrey paid down his twenty guineas, and Captain Bain stowed them\r\naway in his trouser pocket, and buttoned it up carefully, with a dry,\r\n\"Donal' Bain's word's his only recip_ee_.  You be here before ten\r\no'clock and the 'Grassadoo' 'll be waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Captain,\" said Wulfrey.  \"And I'm much obliged to\r\nyou for stretching a point and taking me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me that's doing it, ye understand, not the owners.  That's why.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nThe 'Grace-a-Dieu' justified Wulfrey's inexperienced choice.  She was\r\nan excellent sea-boat, fast, and as dry as could be expected, seeing\r\nthat she was chock full to the hatches, as Jock Steele informed him,\r\nwhile they carried down his baggage.\r\n\r\nBut after his first four hours on board his personal interest in her\r\ncharacter and performance lapsed for three full days.  He had stood\r\nleaning over the side watching the lights of Liverpool as they dropped\r\naway astern, and then those of the Cheshire and North Welsh coasts, and\r\nfelt that now indeed he had cut loose from the past and was in for a\r\ngreat adventure.\r\n\r\nIt gave, him a curious, mixed feeling of depression and elation.  He\r\nfelt at once homeless and endowed with the freedom of the universe.  He\r\nhad burned his boats, he said confidently to himself, and was going\r\nforth to begin a new life, to conquer a new world.  And he set his\r\nteeth and hung on to the heaving bulwark with grim determination.\r\n\r\nBut the sense of elation and width of outlook dwindled with the sinking\r\nlights.  The feeling of homelessness and helplessness grew steadily\r\nupon him.  He had taken the precaution of stowing away a good meal\r\nbefore he set foot on board, and he lived on it for three days.\r\n\r\nHe had never been bodily sick in his life before, but sick as he now\r\nwas he was not too far gone to note the wretched peculiarity of his\r\nsensations, and to muse upon them and the ridiculousness of the\r\nprovision he had made, at the Captain's suggestion, to supplement the\r\nusual cabin fare.\r\n\r\nHe could not imagine himself ever eating again, as he lay there in his\r\nheaving bunk, with nothing to distract his mind from the unhappy\r\nvacuums above and below but the heavy tread of feet overhead at times,\r\nand the ceaseless rush and thrash of the waves a few inches from his\r\near, and the grinning face of the cabin-boy who came in at intervals to\r\nask if he would like anything yet.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees his head ceased to swim if he lifted it an inch off the\r\npillow.  By further degrees he found himself crouching up and clinging\r\nlike a cat while he gazed unsteadily out of the tiny round porthole at\r\nthe tumbling green and white water outside.  Still further\r\ndetermination got him somehow into his clothes, and he dared to feel\r\nhungry and empty without nausea.  Then he crawled out to the deck,\r\nfeeling like a soiled rag.  But the brisk south-west wind cleaned and\r\nbraced him, and presently he nibbled a biscuit and found himself as\r\nhungry as a starving dog.\r\n\r\nAfter that he very soon found his sea-legs, and by the fourth day he\r\nwas a new man, eating ravenously to make up for lost time, and keenly\r\ninterested in all about him.\r\n\r\nSo far they had had favourable weather and made good way.  But Captain\r\nBain was a fervent believer in the inevitability of equinoctials, and\r\nprophesied gales ahead, and the worse for being overdue.\r\n\r\nWulfrey learned, from one and another, chatting at meals with the\r\nCaptain or Sheumaish Macro, one or other of whom was generally on deck,\r\nor with Jock Steele the carpenter, who also acted as boatswain, that\r\nthe 'Grace-a-Dieu' was French-built which, according to Steele,\r\naccounted for the fineness of her lines.\r\n\r\n\"We build stouter but we cannot touch them for cut.  She's as pretty a\r\nlittle ship as ever I set eyes on and floats like a gull,\" was the\r\ncharacter Steele gave her.  And he should know, as he'd made four\r\nvoyages in her since their owners in Glasgow bought her out of the\r\nPrize Court, and she'd never given them any undue trouble even in the\r\nvery worst of weather.\r\n\r\nThe crew, again according to Steele, were a very mixed lot, a few good\r\nseamen, the rest just lubbers out of the crimp house.\r\n\r\nWith Captain Bain and Sheumaish Macro, the mate, he got on well enough,\r\nbut found both by nature very self-contained and manifesting no\r\ninclination for more than the necessary civilities of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"And why should they?\" he said to himself.  \"I'm an outsider and they\r\nknow nothing more about me than I've told them myself.  Another fifteen\r\nor twenty days and we part and are not likely ever to meet again.\"\r\n\r\nHe made one discovery about them, however, which disquieted him\r\nsomewhat.  They were both heavy drinkers, but they usually so arranged\r\nmatters, by taking their full bouts at different times, as not to bring\r\nthe ship into serious peril.\r\n\r\nWulfrey's eyes were opened to it by the fact of his not being able to\r\nsleep one night.  After tossing and tumbling in his bunk for a couple\r\nof hours, and finding sleep as far off as ever, he dressed again\r\nsufficiently to go on deck for a blow.  As he passed through the cabin\r\nhe found Captain Bain there with his head sunk on his arms on the\r\ntable, and, fearing he might be ill, he went up to him.  But he needed\r\nno medical skill to tell him what was the matter.  The old man was as\r\ndrunk as a lord and breathing like an apoplectic hog.  So he eased his\r\nneck gear and left him to sleep it off.\r\n\r\nMacro was on deck in charge of the ship.  Wulfrey simply told him he\r\nhad been unable to sleep, but made no mention of the Captain's\r\ncondition.  And the mate said,\r\n\r\n\"Ay, we're just getting into thick of Gulf Stream and it tells on one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother night he found Steele in charge, and on the growl at the length\r\nof his watch, and gathered from him that both Captain and mate had on\r\nthis occasion been indulging in a bit drink and were snoring in their\r\nbunks.\r\n\r\nHe could only hope that Captain Bain's prognosticated equinoctials,\r\nwhich were now considerably overdue, would not come upon them when both\r\ntheir chiefs were incapacitated.  And his only consolation was the\r\nthought that this was not an exceptional occurrence but probably their\r\nusual habit when well afloat, and that so far no disaster had befallen\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo, day after day, they sped along west-south-west, making good way and\r\nsighting none but an occasional distant sail.  Then they ran into mists\r\nand clammy weather, and sometimes had a wind and drove along with the\r\nswirling fog or across it, and sometimes lay rocking idly and making no\r\nway at all.\r\n\r\nWulfrey gathered, from occasional words they let fall between\r\nthemselves, and from their answers to his own questions, that this was\r\nall usual and to be expected.  They were getting towards Newfoundland\r\nwhere the Northern currents met the Southern, hence the fog, and it was\r\ntoo early for icebergs, so there was no danger in pressing on whenever\r\nthe wind permitted.\r\n\r\nTheir seventeenth day out was the dullest they had had, heavy and\r\nwindless, with a shrouded sky and a close gray horizon and, to\r\nWulfrey's thinking, a sense of something impending.  It was as though\r\nNature had gone into the sulks and was brooding gloomily over some\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bain stripped the ship of her canvas, and sent down the\r\ntopmasts and yards, and made all snug for anything that might turn up.\r\nAll day and all night they lay wallowing in vast discomfort, and\r\nWulfrey lost all relish for his food again.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Bo's'un?\" he asked, as he clawed his way up to\r\nSteele on the after deck, where he was temporarily in charge again.\r\n\r\n\"Someth'n's comin', sir,\" said Steele portentously, \"but what it is\r\nbeats me, unless it's one o' them e-quy-noctials the skipper's bin\r\nlooking for.\"\r\n\r\nIn the night the fog closed down on them as thick as cotton wool; and,\r\nwithout a breath of wind, the long seas came rolling in upon them out\r\nof the thick white bank on one side and out into the thick white bank\r\non the other, till their scuppers dipped deep and worked backwards,\r\nshooting up long hissing white jets over the deck, and making\r\neverything wet and uncomfortable.  Every single joint and timber in the\r\nship seemed to creak and groan as if in pain, and Wulfrey, as he\r\nlistened in the dark to the strident jerkings and grindings and general\r\ncomplainings of the gear, and pictured the wild sweeps and swoops of\r\nthe masts away up in the fog there, wondered how long it could all\r\nstand the strain, and how soon it would come clattering down on top of\r\nthem.  Once, when a bigger roll than usual flung him against the\r\nmainmast and he clung to it for a moment's safety, the rending groans\r\nthat came up through it from the depths below sent a creepy chill down\r\nhis spine.  It sounded so terribly as though the very heart of the ship\r\nwere coming up by the roots.\r\n\r\nSleep was out of the question.  His cabin was unbearable.  Its dolorous\r\ncreakings seemed to threaten collapse and burial at any moment.  If\r\nthey had to go down he would sooner be drowned in the open than like a\r\nrat in its hole.  And so he had crawled up on deck to see what was\r\ntowards.\r\n\r\nThe only comfort he found--and that of a very mixed character--was in\r\nthe sight of Captain Bain and the mate, sitting one on each side of the\r\ncabin table with their legs curled knowingly round its stout wooden\r\nsupports, which were bolted to the floor, and which they used\r\nalternately as fender and anchor to the rolling of the ship.\r\n\r\nThey had made all possible provision against contingencies.  They could\r\ndo no more, and it was no good worrying, so now they sat smoking\r\nphilosophically and drinking now and again from a bottle of rum which\r\nhung by the neck between them from a string attached to the beam above\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nWulfrey stood the discomforts of the deck till he was chilled to the\r\nmarrow, then he tumbled into the cabin, and annexed a third leg of the\r\ntable and sat with the philosophers and waited events.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard on the ship, Captain,\" he said, by way of being\r\ncompanionable.  But the Captain only grunted and deftly tipped some rum\r\ninto his tin pannikin as the bottle swung towards him on its way\r\ntowards the roof.  And the mate looked at him wearily as much as to\r\nsay, \"Man! don't bother us with your babytalk,\" and it seemed to him\r\nthat they had both got a fairly full cargo aboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, he decided it was not for him to judge or condemn.  They knew\r\ntheir own business better than he did.  There was no wind, no way on\r\nthe ship, and all they could do was to lie and wallow and wait for\r\nbetter times.  And the fact that they took it so calmly reassured him\r\nsomewhat.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was so full of fog and tobacco-smoke that the light from the\r\nswinging oil-lamp could barely penetrate beyond the table.  It made a\r\ndull ghastly smudge of yellow light through which the bottle swung to\r\nand fro like an uncouth pendulum, and he sat and watched it.  Now it\r\nwas up above his head between him and the mate; now it was sweeping\r\ngracefully over the table; now it was up above the Captain, who reached\r\nout and tipped some more rum into his pannikin.\r\n\r\nHe watched it till it began to exert a mesmeric influence on, him and\r\nhis head began to feel light and swimmy.  He knew something about\r\nMesmer and his experiments from his reading at home.  He experienced a\r\ndetached interest in his own condition and wondered vaguely if the\r\nbottle would succeed in putting him to sleep.  He tried to keep his\r\neyes on it, but they kept wandering off to the Captain, on whom it had\r\nalready done its business, though in a different way.\r\n\r\nHe was dead tired.  It was, he reckoned, quite six-and-thirty hours\r\nsince he had had any sleep.  What time of night or morning it was he\r\nhad no idea.  This awful rolling and groaning and creaking seemed to\r\nhave been going on for an incalculable time.\r\n\r\nWhat with the heavy unwholesomeness of the atmosphere, and the\r\nmonotonous swing of the bottle, and the lethargic impassivity of his\r\ncompanions, he fell at last into a condition of dull stupidity, which\r\nmight have ended in sleep but for the necessity of alternately hanging\r\non to and fending off the table, as the roll of the ship flung him away\r\nfrom it or at it.  And how long this went on he never knew.\r\n\r\nHe was jerked back to life by a sudden clatter of feet overhead and a\r\nshout.  Then he was flung bodily on to the table, and found himself\r\nlying over it and looking down at Captain Bain, who had tumbled\r\nbackwards in a heap into a corner.  The rum-bottle banged against the\r\nroof and rained its fragments down on him.  The lamp leaned up at a\r\npreposterous angle and stopped there.\r\n\r\n\"We're done,\" thought Wulfrey dazedly, and became aware of fearsome\r\nsounds outside,--a wild howling shriek as of all the fiends out of the\r\npit,--thunderous blows as of mighty hammers under which the little ship\r\nreeled and staggered,--then grisly crackings and rendings and crashes\r\non deck, mingled with the feeble shouts of men.\r\n\r\nThen, shuddering and trembling, the ship slowly righted herself and\r\nWulfrey breathed again.  Outside, the howling shriek was as loud as\r\never, the banging and buffeting worse than before.\r\n\r\nMacro unhooked his long legs from the table and made for the door.  The\r\nCaptain gathered himself up dazedly and rolled after him, and Wulfrey\r\nfollowed as best he could.\r\n\r\nBut he could see very little.  The fog was gone.  The fierce rush of\r\nthe gale drove the breath back into his throat and came near to choking\r\nhim.  Huge green seas topped with snarling white came leaping up over\r\nthe side of the ship near him.  A man with an axe was chopping\r\nfuriously at the shrouds of the fallen main-mast amid a wild tangle of\r\nropes and spars.  As they parted, the ship swung free and went\r\nlabouring off before the gale under somewhat easier conditions, and\r\nWulfrey hung tight in the cabin doorway and breathed still more\r\nhopefully.  He had thought the end was come, but they were still\r\nafloat, though sadly shorn and battered.  What their chances of\r\nultimate safety might be was beyond him, but while there was life there\r\nwas hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nFor three days life to Wulfrey was a grim experience made up of damp\r\ndiscomfort, lack of food and rest, and growing hopelessness.\r\n\r\nBoth their masts had gone like carrots, leaving only their ragged\r\nstumps sticking up out of the deck.  \"An' if they hadn't we'd bin gone\r\nourselves,\" growled the carpenter to him one day.  Where they fell the\r\nsides of the ship were smashed and torn, and the hungry waves came\r\nyapping up through the gaps, most horribly close and threatening.\r\n\r\nThree men had been washed overboard in that first fierce onrush.  The\r\nrest crouched miserably in the forecastle, and no man on board could\r\nremember what it felt like to be dry and warm and full.\r\n\r\nMeals there were none.  When any man's hunger forced him to eat, he\r\nwolfed sodden biscuit and a chunk of raw pork, and washed it down with\r\nrum.\r\n\r\nSo ghastly did the discomfort become, as the wretched days succeeded\r\nthe still more miserable nights, that at last Wulfrey, for one, was\r\nprepared to welcome even the end as a change for the better.\r\n\r\nObservations were out of the question.  In these four days they never\r\nonce saw sun or moon or star, nothing but a close black sky, gray with\r\nflying spume.  The great seas came roaring out of it behind them and\r\nrushed roaring into it in front of them, and where they were getting\r\nto, beyond the fact that they were driving continuously more or less\r\nwest-by-north, no man knew.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bain and the mate and the carpenter had done all that could be\r\ndone since the catastrophe, but that was very little.  An attempt was\r\nmade to rig a jury mast on the stump of the foremast, but the gale\r\nripped it away with a jeering howl and would have none of it.  With\r\nsome planking torn from the inside of the ship they barricaded the seas\r\nout of the forecastle as well as they could.  It was the carpenter's\r\nidea to fix these planks upright, so that their ends stood up somewhat\r\nabove the top of the forecastle, and so great was the grip of the gale\r\nthat that slight projection sufficed to keep their head straight before\r\nit and afforded them slight steerage way.\r\n\r\nSo they staggered along, dismantled and discomfited, and waited for the\r\ngale to blow itself out or them to perdition, and were worn so low at\r\nlast that they did not much care which, so only an end to their misery.\r\n\r\nAnd the end came as unexpectedly as the beginning.  From sheer\r\nweariness they slept at times, in chill discomfort and dankest\r\nwretchedness, just where they sat or lay.  And Wulfrey was lying so, in\r\na stupor of misery, caring neither for life nor death, when the final\r\ncatastrophe came.\r\n\r\nWithout any warning the ship struck something with a horrible shock\r\nthat flung everything inside it ajee.  Then she heeled over on her\r\nstarboard side, baring her breast to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe great green waves leaped at her like wolves on a foundered deer.\r\nThey had been chasing her for three days past and now they had got her.\r\nShe was down and they proceeded to worry her to pieces.  No ship ever\r\nbuilt could stand against their fury.  The 'Grace-a-Dieu' melted into\r\nfragments as though she had been built of cardboard.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, jerked violently out of the corner where he had been lying,\r\nrolled down towards the door of the cabin as the ship heeled over.  As\r\nhe clawed himself up to look out, a green mountain of water caught him\r\nup and carried him high over the port bulwarks which towered like a\r\nhouse above him, and swept him along on its broken crest.\r\n\r\nHe could swim, but no swimmer could hope to save himself by swimming in\r\nsuch a sea, and he was weak and worn with the miseries of the last\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nHe had no hope of deliverance, but yet struck out mechanically to keep\r\nhis head above water, and his thrashing arm struck wood.  He gripped it\r\nwith the grip of a drowning man and clung for dear life.\r\n\r\nIt was a large square structure, planking braced with cross-pieces,\r\nalmost a raft.  He hung to the edge while the water ran out of his\r\nmouth and wits, and then, inch by inch, hauled himself cautiously\r\nfurther aboard, and, lying flat, looked anxiously about for signs of\r\nhis shipmates, but with little hope.\r\n\r\nHe could see but a yard or two on either side, and then only the\r\nthreatening welter of the monstrous green seas, terrifyingly close and\r\nswelling with menace.\r\n\r\nNothing? ... Stay!--a white gleam under the green, like a scrap of\r\npaper in a whirlpool, and a desperate face emerged a yard or so away\r\nand a wildly-seeking hand.\r\n\r\nThe anguished eyes besought him, and, not knowing what else to do, he\r\ngripped two of the cross-pieces of his raft and launched his legs out\r\ntowards the drowning man.  They were seized as in a vice, and\r\npresently, inch by inch, the gripping hands crept up his body till the\r\nother could lay hold of the raft for himself.  And Wulfrey, turning,\r\nsaw that it was the mate, Sheumaish Macro, whose life he had saved.\r\n\r\nThey drew themselves cautiously up into such further safety as the\r\nfrail ark offered and lay there spent.  And Wulfrey, for one, wondered\r\nif the quicker end had not been the greater gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nSleeping and eating anyhow and at any time, they had lost all count of\r\ntime this last day or two.  It was, however, daylight of a kind, but so\r\ngray and murky and mixed with flying spume that they could see but\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nNeither man had spoken since they crawled up on to the raft.  Death was\r\nso close that speech seemed futile.  They both lay flat on their\r\nstomachs, gripping tight, and peering hopelessly through nearly closed\r\neyes, expectant of nothing, doubting the wisdom of their choice of the\r\nlonger death.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" cried Macro of a sudden, as they swung up the back of a wave.\r\n\"Where in ---- ha' we got to?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Wulfrey got a glimpse of most amazing surroundings.\r\n\r\nRight ahead of them the sea was all abristle with what, to his quick\r\namazed glance, looked like the bones and ribs of multitudinous ships,\r\nthe ruins of a veritable Armada.\r\n\r\nNow it was all hidden, as they sank into a weltering green valley with\r\ntumbling green walls all about them.  Then the solid green bottom of\r\ntheir valley was ripped into furious white foam, and stark black baulks\r\nof timber came lunging up through it, all crusted with barnacles,\r\nfestooned with hanging weeds, and laced with streaming white.  They\r\nlooked like grisly arms of deep-sea monsters reaching up out of the\r\ndepths to lay hold of them.  They seemed intent on impaling the frail\r\nraft.  They seemed to change places, to dart hither and thither as\r\nthough to head it off, to lie in wait for it, to spring up in its\r\ncourse.  It was frightful and unnerving.  Wulfrey shut his eyes tight\r\nand set his teeth, and waited for the inevitable crash and the end.\r\n\r\nA great wave lifted them high above the venomous black timbers and,\r\nswinging on its course, dropped them as deftly as a crane could have\r\ndone it, into the inside of a mighty cage.\r\n\r\nWave after wave did its best to lift them out and speed them on.  Their\r\nraft rose and fell and banged rudely against the ribs of their prison.\r\nUp and down they swung, and round and round, bumping and grinding till\r\nthey feared the raft would go to pieces.  But the tide had passed its\r\nhighest and the storm was blowing itself out, and they had come to the\r\nend of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\"We're in hell,\" gasped the mate, as he clung to the jerking\r\ncross-pieces to keep himself from being flung off, and to Wulfrey's\r\nstorm-broken senses it seemed that he was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nAll that night they swung and bumped inside their cage, with somewhat\r\nless of bodily discomfort as the wind fell and the sea went down, but\r\nwith only such small relief to their minds as postponement of immediate\r\ndeath might offer.\r\n\r\nWulfrey lay prone on the raft, grimping to it mechanically, utterly\r\nworn out with all he had gone through these last four days.  He sank\r\ninto a stupor again and lay heedless of everything.\r\n\r\nThe tide fell to its lowest and was rising again when dawn came, and\r\nthough the huge green waves still rolled through their cage, and swung\r\nthem to and fro, and sent them rasping against its massive bars, they\r\nwere as nothing compared with the waves of yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of Macro cracking shell-fish and eating them that\r\nroused Wulfrey.  He raised his heavy head and looked round.  The mate\r\nhacked off a bunch of huge blue-black mussels from the post they were\r\ngrinding against at the moment, opened several of them and put them\r\nunder his nose.  Without a word he began eating and felt the better for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPresently he sat up and looked about him in amazement, and rubbed the\r\nsalt out of his smarting eyes and looked again.\r\n\r\n\"Where in heaven's name are we?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nAnd well he might, for stranger sight no man ever set eyes on.\r\n\r\n\"Last night I thocht we were in hell,\" said Macro grimly.  \"An' seems\r\nto me we're not far from it.  We're in the belly of a dead ship an'\r\nthere's nought but dead ships round us.\"\r\n\r\nTheir immediate harbourage, into which the friendly wave had dropped\r\nthem, was composed of huge baulks of timber like those that had tried\r\nto end them the night before, sea-sodden and crusted thick with\r\nshell-fish, and as Wulfrey's eyes wandered along them he saw that the\r\nmate was right.  They were undoubtedly the mighty weather-worn ribs of\r\nsome great ship, canting up naked and forlorn out of the depths and\r\nreaching far above their heads.  There in front was the great curving\r\nstem-piece, and yon stiff straight piece behind was the stern-post.\r\n\r\nBut when his eyes travelled out beyond these things his jaw dropped\r\nwith sheer amazement.\r\n\r\nEverywhere about them, wherever he looked, and as far as his sight\r\ncould reach, lay dead ships and parts of ships.  Some, like their own,\r\nentire gaunt skeletons, but more still in grisly fragments.  Close\r\nalongside them a great once-white, now weather-gray and ghostly\r\nfigurehead representing an angel gazed forlornly at them out of\r\nsightless eyes.  From the position of its broken arms and the round\r\nfragment of wood still in its mouth, it had probably once blown a\r\ntrumpet, but the storm-fiends would have no music but their own and had\r\nlong since made an end of that.\r\n\r\nClose beside it jutted up a piece of a huge mast, with part of the\r\nsquare top still on and ragged ropes trailing from it.  Alongside it a\r\nbowsprit stuck straight up to heaven, defiant of fate, and more\r\nforlornly, a smaller ship's whole mast with yards and broken gear still\r\nhanging to it all tangled and askew.  And beyond, whichever way he\r\nlooked--always the same, dead ships and the limbs and fragments of them.\r\n\r\n\"It's a graveyard,\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Juist that,\" said the mate dourly, \"an' we're the only living things\r\nin it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd presently, brooding upon it, he said, \"There'll be sand down below\r\nan' they're bedded in it.  When tide goes down again maybe we can get\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Deil kens! ... But it cann't be worse than stopping here.\"\r\n\r\nThe slow tide lifted them higher and higher within their cage, hiding\r\nsome of the baleful sights but giving them wider view over the whole\r\ngrim field.  They sat, and by way of change stood and lay, on their\r\ncramped platform.  They knocked off shell-fish and ate them.  So far,\r\nso water-sodden had they been of late, they had not suffered from\r\nthirst, but the dread of it was with them.\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, the waters sank, and all the bristling bones of ships\r\ncame up again.\r\n\r\n\"Can you swim?\" asked Macro abruptly at last.\r\n\r\n\"I can.  But I feel very weak.  I can't go far I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't stop on here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over yonder.  They're thickest there and they stand out more.  Mebbe\r\nit's shallower that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best to follow you.  If I can't, you go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay.  You gave me a hand last night.  We'll stick together, and sooner\r\nwe start the better....  Stay ... mebbe we can----\" and he began\r\npounding at the end planks of their raft with his foot to start them\r\nfrom the cross-pieces.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas the roof of the galley,\" he explained, \"and none too well made.\r\nIt got stove in last voyage and we rigged this one up ourselves.  My\r\nwonder is it held together in the night.\"\r\n\r\nHe managed at last with much stamping to loosen four boards.\r\n\r\n\"One under each arm will help,\" he said, \"An' we can paddle along an'\r\nnot get tired.\"\r\n\r\nHe let himself down into the water, shipped a board under each arm, and\r\nstruck out between two of the gaunt ribs, and Wulfrey followed him,\r\nsomewhat doubtful as to what might come of it.\r\n\r\nBut the mate had taken his bearings and was following a reasoned\r\ncourse.  Over yonder the wrecks lay thick.  There might be one on which\r\nthey could find shelter--even food.  But that he hardly dared to hope\r\nfor.  As far as he had been able to judge, at that distance, they were\r\nall wrecks of long ago and mostly only bare ribs and stumps.\r\n\r\nTo Wulfrey, from water-level, the sea ahead seemed all abristle with\r\nshipping, as thick, he thought to himself, as the docks at Liverpool.\r\nBut there all was life and bustling activity, and here was only\r\ndeath,---dead ships and pieces of ships, and maybe dead men.  The\r\nfeeling of it was upon them both, and they splashed slowly along with\r\nas little noise as possible, as though they feared to rouse the\r\nsleepers who had once peopled all these gruesome ruins.\r\n\r\n\"See yon!\" whispered Macro hoarsely, as he slowed up and waited for\r\nWulfrey to come alongside, and following the jerk of his head Wulf saw\r\nthe figure of a man grotesquely spread-eagled in a vast tangle of\r\ncordage that hung like a net from a broken mast.\r\n\r\n\"We had better see,\" said Wulfrey, and kicked along towards it, the\r\nmate following with visible reluctance.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of Jock Steele, the carpenter, livid and sodden, and\r\nmany hours dead.\r\n\r\n\"I would we hadna seen him,\" growled Macro.\r\n\r\n\"He'll do us no harm.  He was a decent man.  I'm sorry he's gone.  Is\r\nthere any chance of any of the others being alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Deil a chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, we are----\"\r\n\r\n\"You had the deil's own luck and it's only by you I'm here.  Let's get\r\non,\" and they splashed on again.\r\n\r\nPast wreck after wreck, grim and gaunt and grisly, mostly of very\r\nancient date, all swept bare to the bone by the fury of the seas, all\r\nwith the water washing coldly through them.  Now and again Macro\r\ngrowled terse comments,--\r\n\r\n\"A warship,--from the size of her.  See those ribs, they'll last\r\nanother hundred years.  And yon's a Dutchman.  They build stout too.\r\nMostly British though, bound to be, hereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea where we are, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"An idea--ay!  I've heard tell o' this place, but I never met anyone\r\nhad been here.  They mostly never come back.  They call it what you\r\ncalled it a while ago--'The Graveyard.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sable Island, if I'm right,--'bout one hundred miles off Nova Scotia.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is there any island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,--on the chart, but I never met any man had been there.  We're\r\nlooking for it.  There's no depth here or all them ribs wouldn't be\r\nsticking up like that.  They're stuck in the sand below.  Must be over\r\nyonder where they lie so thick....  An' a fearsome place when we get\r\nthere, with the spirits of all them dead men all about it--hundreds of\r\n'em,--thousands, mebbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do ships ever call there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if they can help it, I trow.  It's Death brings 'em and he holds\r\n'em tight....  Hearken to that now!\"--and he stopped as though in doubt\r\nabout going further.\r\n\r\nAnd Wulfrey, listening intently, caught a faint thin sound of wailing\r\nfar away in the distance.  It rose and fell, shrill and piercing and\r\nvery discomforting, though very far away.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he jerked.\r\n\r\n\"Spirits,\" breathed Macro, and his face was more scared and haggard\r\neven than before.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Wulfrey, with an assumption of brusqueness for his own\r\nreassurance, for this dismal progress through the graveyard was telling\r\nsorely on him also, and the sounds that came wavering across the water\r\nwere as like the shrieking of souls in torment as anything he could\r\nimagine.  \"There are no such things.  Don't be a fool, man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Man alive!--no spirits?  The Islands are full o' them, an' this place\r\nfuller still.  Yes, indeed!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was obviously impossible to float about there for ever.  The\r\nwater was not nearly so cold as Wulfrey had expected, but the strain of\r\nthe night and of the preceding days of semi-starvation had told on him,\r\nand he was feeling that he could not stand much more.  He set off\r\ndoggedly again towards the thickest agglomeration of dead shipping in\r\nfront, and the mate followed him with a face full of foreboding.\r\n\r\nThey went in silence, paying no heed now to the things they passed on\r\nthe way, though the apparently endless succession of dead ships and the\r\nparts of them was not without its effect on their already broken\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" cried Macro of a sudden.  \"I touched ground or I'm a Dutchman!\r\nAy--sand it is,\" and Wulfrey sinking his feet found firm bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Better keep the floats,\" suggested the mate.  \"Mebbe it's only the\r\nside of a bank we're on.\"\r\n\r\nThey waded on, breast-deep, and presently were out of their depth\r\nagain.  But the feel of something below them, and the certainty that it\r\nwas still not very far away, were cheering.  In a few minutes they were\r\nwalking again, having evidently crossed a channel between two banks.\r\nAnd so, alternately walking and swimming, they drew at last towards the\r\njungle of wreckage; and all the time, from somewhere beyond it, rose\r\nthose piercing, wailing screams which Macro in his heart was certain\r\ncame from the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nHere the water was no more than up to their knees and shoaling still,\r\nand they came now upon more than the bones of ships,--chaotic masses of\r\nmasts and spars and rigging piled high and wide in fantastic confusion,\r\nand in among them, tangled beyond even the power of the seas to chase\r\nthem further, barrels and boxes and crates, some still whole, mostly\r\nbroken; rotting bales, and pitiful and ridiculous fragments of their\r\ncontents worked in among them as if by impish hands.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, what wastry!\" said Macro at the sight.  \"There's many a thousand\r\npounds of goods piled here,--ay, hunderds of thousands, webbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd give it all for a crust of bread,\" said Wulfrey hungrily.\r\n\r\n\"An' mebbe there's that too.  If any o' them casks has flour in 'em we\r\nneedn' starve.  It cakes round the sides wi' the wet, but the core's\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\nThen, beyond the gigantic barrier of wastry, rose again that shrill\r\nscreaming and shrieking, louder than ever, and Macro said \"Gosh!\" and\r\nlooked like bolting back into the sea.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, determined to fathom it, hauled himself painfully up a tangle\r\nof ropes and clambered to the top of the pile and saw, about a mile\r\naway, a narrow yellow spit of sand, and all about it a dense cloud of\r\nsea-birds, myriads of them, circling, diving, swooping, quarrelling.\r\n\r\nOne moment the vast gray cloud of them drooped to the sea and seemed to\r\nsettle there, the next it was whirling aloft like a writhing\r\nwater-spout, every component drop of which was a venomous bundle of\r\nfeathers shrieking and screaming its hardest in the bitter fight for\r\nfood.  And the harsh and raucous clamour of them, each intent on its\r\nown, had in it something fiendishly inhuman and chilling to the blood.\r\n\r\n\"It's only sea-birds, man,\" he cried to Macro.  \"Come up and see for\r\nyourself,\" and the mate, with new life at the word, hauled himself up\r\nalongside and stood staring.\r\n\r\n\"My Gosh! ... I never saw the like o' that before,\" he said at last.\r\n\"There's millions of 'em.  They're fighting ... over our shipmates\r\nmebbe....  We needn' starve if we can get at 'em,\" a sentiment which\r\nsomehow, in all the circumstances of the case, did not greatly appeal\r\nto Wulfrey, hungry as he was.\r\n\r\n\"If they all set on a man he wouldn't have much chance,\" he said, with\r\na shiver.  \"They could pick him clean before he knew where he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only dead men they feed on,\" said Macro, quite himself again,\r\nsince it was only birds they had to deal with and not disembodied\r\nspirits.  \"There's land.  Let's get ashore,\" and they crawled\r\nprecariously along over the wreckage, which sagged and dipped beneath\r\nthem in places, and in places towered high and had to be scaled as best\r\nthey could, and at times they had to wade or swim from pile to pile.\r\n\r\nAmazing things they chanced upon in their course, but were too intent\r\non reaching land to give them more than a passing glance or a shudder.\r\nMore than once they came on bones of men, jammed in tight among the\r\nraffle, and slowly picked by the sea and the things that lived in it\r\ntill they gleamed white and polished and clean.  And their grinning\r\nteeth, set in the awful fixed smile of the fleshless, seemed to welcome\r\nthem as future recruits to their company.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--ah!  So you've come at last!\" they seemed to say, as they laughed\r\nup at them out of holes and corners.  \"We've been waiting for you all\r\nthese years and here you are at last.\"\r\n\r\nThere were, too, bales and boxes of what had been rich cloths and silks\r\nand satins and coarser stuffs, worried open by the fret of the sea and\r\nreduced to sodden slimy punk, and casks and barrels beyond the counting.\r\n\r\n\"Wastry!  Wastry!\" panted Macro.  \"We'll come back sometime, mebbe.\"\r\n\r\nBut, for the moment, their only craving was for dry land, to savour the\r\nsolid safety of it, and get something to eat if they could, and a long\r\nlong rest.\r\n\r\nWith desperate determination they dragged their sodden and weary bodies\r\nthrough the shallows beyond, and blind fury filled them with spasmodic\r\nvigour as they saw what the sea-birds were feeding on.\r\n\r\nOver each poor body the carrion crew settled like flies, and tore and\r\nscreamed and quarrelled.  The two living men dashed at them with angry\r\nshouts, and the birds rose in a shrieking host amazed at their\r\ninterference.  But only for a moment.  They came swooping down again in\r\na gray-white cloud, with raucous cries and eyes like fiery beads, and\r\nbeat at them with their wings, and menaced them with already reddened\r\nbeaks.  And they looked so murderously intentioned that the men were\r\nfain to bow their heads and run, with flailing arms to keep them off.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last to dry land, and grateful they were for the feel of it,\r\neven though it seemed no more than a waste of sand but a few feet above\r\ntide-level.  That last tussle with the birds had drained their strength\r\ncompletely.  They dropped spent on the beach and lay panting.\r\n\r\nTheir flight had set their chilled blood coursing again, a merciful sun\r\nhad come up above the clouds that lay along the horizon, and in spite\r\nof their hunger and the fact that their very bones felt soaked with\r\nsalt water, they both fell asleep where they lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nWulfrey was wakened by a sharp stab in the neck, and when he sat up\r\nwith a start a huge cormorant squawked affrightedly at the dead man\r\ncoming to life again, and flapped away, gibbering curses and leaving a\r\nmost atrocious stink behind him.\r\n\r\nThe mate was still sleeping soundly, and Wulfrey, for the time being\r\nmore painfully cognisant of the gnawing emptiness within than of the\r\nmiracle that permitted him any sensation whatever, sat gazing anxiously\r\nabout and revolving the primary problem of food.\r\n\r\nOut there among all that mass of wreckage it would be strange if they\r\ncould not find something eatable,--cores of flour barrels, perhaps\r\npickled pork, rum almost certainly; and the clammy void inside him\r\ncraved these things most ardently.  But he could not, as yet, imagine\r\nhimself venturing out there again to get them.  Later on perhaps, but\r\nfor the present the land, such as it was, must provide, for him at all\r\nevents.  He felt that he simply had not the heart or the strength to\r\nmake the attempt.\r\n\r\nLet me say at once that the trying of these men, which came upon them\r\npresently, was not in the matter of ways and means.  It was of the\r\nspirit, not of the flesh.  But yet it is necessary to show you how they\r\ncame through these lesser trials of the flesh only to meet the greater\r\ntrials of the spirit later on.  And even these smaller matters are not\r\nentirely devoid of interest.\r\n\r\nMany birds came circling round expectantly, and swooped down towards\r\nthe dark figures lying in the sand, and went off in shrill amazement\r\nwhen they were denied.  And Macro at last stretched and yawned and sat\r\nup, staring dazedly at Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, but I'm hungered,\" he said at last, as that paramount claim\r\nemphasised itself.  \"Anything to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm wondering.  Plenty of birds, and very bad they smell.  I've seen\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate got up heavily and found himself sore and stiff.  He stood\r\nlooking thoughtfully about him.\r\n\r\n\"What about all that stuff?\" and he jerked his head towards the\r\ngraveyard wreckage.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't go again yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor me either....  Ground's higher over yonder,\" he said.  \"Let's go\r\nand see,\" and they set off slowly over the sand.\r\n\r\nThe level of high water was thickly strewn with seaweed and small\r\nwreckage.  The slope of the shore was so long and gentle that no large\r\nobject could come in unless it were first broken into fragments outside.\r\n\r\nThe mate kicked over the sea-weed and found some which he put into his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Any good?\" asked Wulfrey anxiously, hungrier than ever at sight of the\r\nother's working jaws.\r\n\r\n\"Better'n nothing,\" and he rooted up another piece and handed it over.\r\nWulfrey found it tough and pungent of the sea and, after much chewing,\r\ncapable of being swallowed, but the most he also could say for it was\r\nthat it was just that much better than nothing.\r\n\r\nThey each picked up a piece of wood with which to root in the tangle,\r\nand, bending and picking and munching, made their way slowly towards\r\nthe hummocks in front.\r\n\r\nThese were a low range of sandhills, some of them as much as thirty\r\nfeet high, and on the seaward side, which they climbed, they were\r\nsparsely clothed with coarse slate-green wire-grass about a foot in\r\nheight, which bristled up like porcupines' quills and helped to keep\r\nthe loose soft sand together.  They pulled some up to see if the roots\r\nlooked edible, and found them spreading far and wide below ground in a\r\nmatted tangle of white succulent-looking tendrils, which proved as\r\ntough and unsatisfying as the sea-weed, but had the advantage of a\r\ndifferent flavour.\r\n\r\nGrubbing along, they climbed heavily through the yielding sand to the\r\ntop of the nearest hummock.  Macro, arriving there first, jerked a\r\ngratified \"Gosh!\" and floundered down the other side whirling his\r\nstick, and Wulfrey was just in time to catch the amazing sight of the\r\nwhole surface of the little valley beyond in violent motion.\r\n\r\nHe thought at first that something had gone wrong with his eyes, for\r\neverywhere he looked the sand seemed to be jumping and skipping and\r\nburying itself in itself.  And then from the innumerable little flecks\r\nof white, bobbing spasmodically all over the place, he perceived that\r\nthese were rabbits, and the mate was in among them, knocking them on\r\nthe head as fast as his stick could whirl.  By the time Wulfrey reached\r\nhim he was sitting in the sand, skinning one with his knife, and half a\r\ndozen more lay round him.\r\n\r\n\"Better than roots and seaweed,\" he said, as he hacked the first in\r\npieces and stuffed some into his mouth and handed some to Wulfrey.\r\n\"There's millions of 'em.  We won't starve,\" and he started skinning\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nRaw meat was a novelty, to Wulfrey at all events but baby-rabbit flesh\r\nis eatable, even raw, and it put new life into them both.\r\n\r\nThe little valley in which they sat was like an oasis in the sandy\r\ndesert outside.  For here, among the wire-grass grew innumerable small\r\ncreeping-plants and that so sturdily though so modestly that, in spite\r\nof the vast horde of rabbits, the whole place was carpeted with green,\r\nand right in the centre, where the ground was lowest and the\r\nundergrowth thickest and darkest, was a considerable pool of rainwater,\r\nwhich they found brackish but drinkable.\r\n\r\n\"All we want now is shelter and fire, and we'll live like kings and\r\nfighting-cocks,\" said Macro, when he had time for anything but\r\nrabbit-flesh, and lay back comfortably distent.\r\n\r\n\"And where shall we find shelter and fire in this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man!  There's more'n we'll ever need in all our lives, over yonder.\r\nBut it'll keep....  I'm not for going back there this day anyway.\r\nTo-morrow, mebbe,----\" he said drowsily, and presently they were both\r\nfast asleep again.  And the rabbits came out at sunset and hopped about\r\nthem, and sniffed them with quivering noses and disrelish, and the\r\nheavy dew fell on them, but they never woke.  For Nature had now got\r\nall she needed for the reparation of the previous waste, and she was\r\nbusily at work making good while they slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nMorning broke dull, and heavy.  The air was mild but full of moisture,\r\nand they were chilled with their long sleep in the open.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh! but I'd like to feel dry again,\" said Macro, as they sat\r\nmunching raw rabbit for breakfast.  \"D'you feel like going out yonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel three times the man I was yesterday.  But should we not go on\r\nfurther first?  There may be someone living on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul but us two, I warrant you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But since we're here there might be others.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so.  There might be, but not likely.  It's just luck, deil's\r\nown luck, 'at those screeching deevils out yonder aren't picking us to\r\npieces like the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say Providence, and I'll agree with you,\" said Wulfrey, who saw no\r\nneed to ascribe to the devil so obviously good a work as far as they\r\nwere concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Ca' it what you like, not one man in a thousand comes alive through\r\nwhat we came through.  And I'm not forgetting that but for you I'd no\r\nbe here myself.  We can take a bit look round, but I'm sore set on a\r\ncovering of some kind and a fire, and some rum would be cheerful.  It's\r\nin my bones that we'll find all we want out there, and more besides.\"\r\n\r\nSo, after breakfast, they set off, carrying a couple of rabbits for\r\nprovision by the way.\r\n\r\nLooking round from the top of the highest hummock, they saw the great\r\ntwisting cloud of sea-birds hovering over the distant wreckage, and the\r\nshrill clamour of their screaming came faintly to them on the still\r\nair.  They had cleaned up what the sea had stranded on the spit and had\r\nhad to go further afield.\r\n\r\nFrom this vantage point they could to some extent make out the lie of\r\nthe island.  It ran nearly west and east and the narrow sand-spit on\r\nwhich they had landed was the extreme western point.  Where they stood,\r\nthe land was about a quarter of a mile in width and it stretched away\r\nin front further than they could see, in vast stretches of sand with a\r\nline of hummocks all along the northern side.  It seemed very narrow,\r\njust a long thin wedge of sand, with illimitable gray sea on each side,\r\nas far as their eyes could reach.  Right ahead, and about a mile away,\r\nwas a great sheet of water, whether lake or inlet they could not tell.\r\nThe hummocks ran along its northern side, and a narrow strip of sand\r\ndivided it from the sea on the south.\r\n\r\n\"We'd best keep to the ridges,\" said Macro.  \"Yon spit on the other\r\nside may only end in the sea,\" so they tramped on along the firm beach\r\non the seaward slope of the line of hummocks, and every now and again\r\nclimbed up to see what was on the other side.  When they found\r\nthemselves abreast of the sheet of water they went down and found it\r\nsalt and very shallow.  It stretched away in front as far as they could\r\nsee, but Macro thought he could see more sand hummocks at the far end.\r\n\r\nEvery here and there, when they climbed the ridge to look over, they\r\ncame on little basins like their own, comparatively green and populous\r\nwith rabbits.  But never a sign of human life or habitation, not a tree\r\nor a shrub, not an animal except the rabbits.\r\n\r\n\"A God-forsaken hole,\" was the mate's comment, as they stood, after a\r\ncouple of hours' trudging, looking out over the interminable ridges in\r\nfront, and the great unruffled sheet of water below, and the gray\r\nslow-heaving sea beyond on both sides, and the gray sky enclosing all.\r\n\r\n\"There's nought here and never has been.  Let's go back and get to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"That lake, or inlet, or whatever it is, seems to narrow over there.\r\nSuppose we see where it goes to,\" suggested Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"Only back into sea, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, they tramped on along the beach, and next time they looked\r\nover the ridge the land below had broadened out.  The water had shrunk\r\nto a mere channel which ran, they saw, not into the sea but into a\r\nstill larger lake beyond, unless it in turn should prove to be a long\r\narm of the sea running all through the middle of the island.  They\r\ncould follow the low sand-spit which divided it from the sea on the\r\nsouth side, and the long line of hummocks on the north, till they faded\r\nout of sight in the distance.\r\n\r\nRight in front of them spread the largest valley they had yet come\r\nacross, and the coast ridges ran down into the middle of it and ended\r\nin the highest hill they had seen, and between the hill and the lake\r\nlay a number of large ponds.\r\n\r\n\"We must get up there,\" said Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"No manner o' use,\" growled the mate, who found tramping through the\r\nsand very tiring, and was eager to get back and attack the wreckage for\r\nshelter and fire and food and rum.\r\n\r\n\"Stop you here then, Macro, and I'll go on.  If there's anything to see\r\nI'll wave my arms.  You might skin those rabbits too.  I'm beginning to\r\nfeel empty again.\"\r\n\r\nHe struck straight across the valley to the ponds, and was delighted to\r\nfind them fresh and much better to the taste than their own little\r\npool.  Then he climbed the hill, which was not far short of a hundred\r\nfeet in height.  And then Macro, who had been watching him\r\nintermittently as he hacked at the rabbits, saw him wave his arms in so\r\nexcited a fashion that he picked up the rabbits and ran, wondering what\r\nnew thing he'd found now that set him dancing in that fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd when at last he panted heavily up the yielding side of the hill and\r\nsaw, he gasped \"Gosh!\" with all the breath he had left, and sat down\r\nopen-mouthed and stared as if he could not believe his eyes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the end of the valley, the great lake stretched away further\r\nthan they could see, and in a deep bend on the north side of it lay two\r\nships.\r\n\r\n\"Schooners, b' Gosh!\" jerked Macro, as soon as he could speak; and eyed\r\nthem intently.  \"How in name of sin did they get there?\" and his eye\r\ntravelled quickly along the sand-spit that shut out the sea, in search\r\nof the break in it through which the schooners must have entered.  But\r\nno break was visible.  Still it might well be that this great inland\r\nlake joined the outer sea somewhere over there, beyond their range of\r\nsight, and that this was a harbour of refuge, though he had certainly\r\nnever heard of it before.\r\n\r\n\"We must find out about 'em,\" he said at last, and they set off at\r\nspeed towards the ships to which his eyes seemed glued.\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign of a man aboard either of 'em,\" he jerked one time, as he\r\nlurched up out of a rabbit-hole.  \"Nor ashore either.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Wulfrey also there was something strange and uncanny in the look\r\nof them.  The absence of any slightest sign of life anywhere about\r\nimparted to them something of a lifeless look also.  And their masts\r\nwere bare of sails, spars, or even cordage, just bare poles sticking up\r\nout of the hulls like blighted pine trees.  The sea outside had a long\r\nslow heave in it, but the water of the lake was smooth as a pond, not a\r\npulse in it, not a ripple on it, and the two little ships lay as\r\nmotionless as toy boats on a looking-glass sea.\r\n\r\nMacro was evidently much exercised in his mind.  He never took his eyes\r\noff the ships.  So intent was he on them that he stumbled in and out of\r\nrabbit holes without noticing them, and the \"Gosh!\" that jerked out of\r\nhim now and again was provoked entirely by the puzzle of the ships.\r\n\r\nSo they came at last round the curve of the land and stood opposite the\r\nnearer of the two, which lay about a hundred yards out from the shore\r\nof bare sand, and neither on ship nor shore nor water had they\r\ndiscovered any sign of life.\r\n\r\n\"Schooner a-hoy!\" bellowed the mate through his funnelled hands.  And\r\nagain.  \"Schooner a-hoy!\"\r\n\r\nBut no sudden head bobbed up at the hail, and but that they were whole\r\nand afloat the ships looked as dead as those others out past the point.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, but it's odd!\" and he looked quickly both ways along the shore\r\nand over his shoulders, as though he feared some odd thing might start\r\nup suddenly and take him unawares.  \"What's it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no one there.  They're deserted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deserted?  Man alive!  Who'd desert ships afloat like that?  What in\r\n---- does it mean?\" his native fears of the unnatural and inexplicable\r\ngetting the better of him.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go and see,\" said Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"Swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.  I don't expect we can wade.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate shook his head.  He had evidently no liking for the job, keen\r\nas was his desire to get to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's feed first anyway,\" he said, and produced the rabbits, which he\r\nhad held on to in spite of his surprise and many stumblings.  So they\r\nsat in the sand and ate raw rabbit, with their eyes on the ships all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n\"They're dead ships like all the rest,\" was the sum of Macro's\r\nconclusions.  \"But how they got there beats me flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're afloat anyway and they'll be better to sleep in than the\r\nsandhills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--mebbe,--if so be's there's no dead men aboard--or ghosts.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no ghosts anyway.  If there are any dead men we'll bury them\r\ndecently and occupy their bunks.\"\r\n\r\nAt which the mate gave a shiver of distaste and chewed on in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible there's an opening to the sea over yonder?\" asked\r\nWulfrey, with an eastward jerk of the head.\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe, but I don't think it.  There's no seaweed here, and no move in\r\nthe water, and no tide-mark.  It's dead level.  But what if there is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then they might have got in that way, and then some storm blocked\r\nthe opening and they couldn't get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe.  We can find out by travelling along yon spit till we get to\r\nthe end of it.  I'd liefer do that than go aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll sleep better on board than on the sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, ye don't know what ill things may be aboard yon ships!  There's a\r\nwrong look about 'em,\" which was undeniable, but still not enough to\r\ncommend the chill sand to Wulfrey as a resting-place when shelter and\r\npossibly bunks might be had on board.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" he said, as they finished their meal, \"that it\r\ndoesn't matter much how they got there.  We can perhaps find that out\r\nlater.  There they are, and if they're habitable we want to make use of\r\nthem.  I'm going to swim out to this nearest one and find out what's\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go I go,\" grumbled the mate uncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"It's evident there's no one aboard or anywhere about, and it's absurd\r\nto sit here looking at them,\" said Wulf, and began to peel off his\r\nclothes, which had got almost dry with walking.  \"No good getting them\r\nwet again,\" he explained.  \"I've been all of a chill for the last five\r\ndays.  I'll fasten them on to my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be coming back.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might decide to stop there all night.  Better take what's left of\r\nthe meat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" with a perceptible shiver of distaste again.\r\n\r\nHowever, he peeled also, and by careful contrivance with belt and\r\nbraces they bound their bundles on to their heads and stepped into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Phew!  It's cold,--colder than the sea,\" said Wulfrey through\r\ntight-set teeth, as they struck out.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis that,\" and the mate's teeth chittered visibly, between the chill\r\nof the water and distaste of the adventure.\r\n\r\n\"Temperature ought to be same ... if sea comes in,\" sputtered Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"'Tisn't, all same.  It's cauld as death.\"\r\n\r\nThey ploughed along till they reached the nearer ship, and swam round\r\nit in search of entrance, and failing other means laid hold of the\r\nrusty anchor-chain, which peeled in ruddy flakes at their touch.  By\r\nthe time Wulf tumbled in over the bows he was streaked from head to\r\nfoot with iron-mould, and presented so ghastly an appearance that\r\nMacro's jaw fell as he came up the side, and he looked half inclined to\r\ndrop back into the water.\r\n\r\n\"Man!  You look awful.  I tuk you for a ghost,\" he gasped in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"You're nearly as bad yourself, but I took the cream of it.  Now let us\r\nsee what's what.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate's experienced eye showed him at once that the condition of the\r\nship was not due to storm or accident.  She had been deliberately\r\nstripped of everything that could be turned to account elsewhere.  She\r\nwas bare as a board,--not a rope nor a spar was left.  The hatches were\r\nclosed and looked as though they had not been touched for years.\r\n\r\nThey came to the fore-hatch leading down to the fo'c's'le, and he\r\nhauled it up with some difficulty and looked suspiciously down into the\r\ndarkness within.\r\n\r\n\"Below there!\" he cried, in a repressed hollow voice.  But only the\r\nechoes answered him.\r\n\r\nThey passed the main-hatch leading to the hold, and went along, past a\r\ngrated skylight thick with green mould, to the covered gangway leading\r\nto the officers' quarters.  The doors were closed and bolted with rusty\r\nbolts.  There could not by any possibility be anyone below, not anyone\r\nalive, that is.\r\n\r\nMacro wasted no breath here, when they had managed to undo the bolts,\r\nbut he visibly hesitated.  Wulf stepped down into the cabin, and he\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nJust bare walls, nothing more.  Table, stools, lamps, everything\r\nmovable or unscrewable had been carried away.  In the four small rooms\r\nadjacent there were just four empty bunks and not a thing besides.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, but it's queer!\" whispered Macro.  \"Mebbe they're all lying dead\r\nin the hold.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll make sure,\" and they went up on deck again, and with some\r\nlabour, for the wood had swelled and stuck, got up the main hatch and\r\ndropped down into the hold.\r\n\r\nBut that was bare like the rest.  The ship was as empty as a drum.\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as a rat, b' Gosh!\" said the mate, with recovered spirits,\r\nseeing no sign of dead men or ghosts.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked Wulf.\r\n\r\n\"She's been stripped bare, that's plain.  But why, beats me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, there's no objection to our stopping here now, I suppose.\r\nBare bunks will be drier than the sand over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so....  And I'm thinking that if we can bring over some of the\r\nstuff from that big pile out yonder we can make ourselves mighty\r\ncomfortable here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can start on that tomorrow.  We've done enough for one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll make a raft, like old Robinson Crusoe, and bring the stuff right\r\ndown to the spit yonder,\" said Macro, waxing quite cheerful at the\r\nprospect.  \"Then we'll make a smaller raft to bring it aboard here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better walk along that spit tomorrow and see if there's any\r\nopening to the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do that, but I doubt there's not, else this water wouldn't be\r\nso cold, and there'd be some movement in it.  It's all dead like\r\neverything else.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent the rest of the daylight poking into every corner of the\r\nship, and in the dark fo'c's'le Macro made a find of surpassing worth.\r\n\r\nHe had rooted everywhere, with a natural enjoyment in the process, and\r\ncome on nothing but bare boards.  \"But you never know,\" he said, and\r\nwent on rooting.  And in the blackest corner his foot struck something\r\nloose which slid away and eluded him.  He went down on his hands and\r\nknees and groped till he found it, and then gave a triumphant shout\r\nwhich brought up Wulfrey in haste.\r\n\r\nIt was a small round metal box such as was used for carrying flint and\r\nsteel and tinder, well-worn and battered, but tightly closed, and the\r\nmate's fingers trembled with anxiety as he opened it with his knife.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks be!\" he breathed deeply, for there in the little battered box\r\nlay all the possibilities of fire,--warmth, cooked food, life--all\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nAnd--\"Thank God!\" said Wulfrey also.  \"That's the best find yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it'll work it's worth its weight in Guinea gold.  But it's old,\r\nold,\" and he poked the tinder doubtfully with his finger, \"as old as\r\nthe ship, and that's older than you or me, I'm thinking.  It's dropped\r\nout of some old pocket and rolled out of sight.  We do have the deil's\r\nown luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Providence!\" said Wulfrey.  \"Can't we make a fire and roast some\r\nrabbit?  I'm sick of raw meat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where'd we make it?  Galley-stove's gone with all the rest, and galley\r\ntoo for that matter....  Wouldn't do to set the ship afire....  There's\r\nonly one safe way.  Soon as we've got a bit of a raft together we'll\r\nbring over sand enough to make a fire-bed in the hold.  Then we can\r\nroast all the rabbits in the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the cover of the big hatchway there?  Wouldn't that carry\r\none of us and sand enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might.  And there's wood enough and to spare in the skin of her down\r\nbelow.  But it'll be dark in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on.  Let's get it overboard.  I'll go.  Can you rip up a board\r\nfor a paddle?\"\r\n\r\nThe hatch-cover was slightly domed and had four-inch coamings all\r\nround, and when let upside down on to the water made a sufficiently\r\neffective raft for light freight.  Macro dropped down into the hold and\r\nripped up a board and jumped it into pieces, and Wulfrey lowered\r\nhimself gingerly down on to his frail craft and set off for the shore,\r\nwith roast rabbit in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll have to look smart or ye'll be in the dark,\" Macro called after\r\nhim, as he leaned over the side watching his clumsy progression.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!  I'll shout if I get lost,\" and the mate went down to break up\r\nfirewood and shred filmy shavings in default of sulphur sticks.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, wafting slowly ashore, lighted on a colony of rabbits intent\r\non supper, and was able to capture a couple in their panic rush for\r\ntheir holes.  Then he hastily loaded his float with all the sand it\r\ncould safely carry and set off again for the ship in great content of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of his cargo to the deck of the ship was a much more\r\ndifficult and precarious job than getting it alongside.  He tried\r\nthrowing it up in handfuls, but that proved slow work and more than\r\nonce came near to spilling him overboard.  And finally, as the night\r\nwas upon them, he took off his coat and sent up larger parcels in it;\r\nand so at last Macro cried enough, and having shown him how to wedge\r\nhis float in between the rusty anchor-chain and the bows, so that the\r\nwind should not drift it away in the night, he helped him up over the\r\nside.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious moment when the first sparks shredded down into the\r\nancient tinder.  But they caught and glowed, and with tenderest coaxing\r\nlighted the mate's carefully-prepared matches, and these the chips, and\r\nthese the faggots, and the mighty cheer and joy of fire were theirs.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night in great comfort, replete with roasted meat,\r\nroofed from winds and dew, and grateful both, each in his own way, for\r\nthe marvellous encouragement of this first day on the island.\r\n\r\nThough their beds were but bare boards, they had no fault to find with\r\nthem, but slept like tops.  And Macro's black head was so full of the\r\nwonderful possibilities of that vast pile of wastry out beyond the\r\npoint, in conjunction with this amazing find of the ships, that there\r\nwas no room left in it for any thought of ghosts or evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nOver their last night's fire they had made provision of roast meat for\r\nbreakfast, and after it they paddled precariously across to the other\r\nschooner, a couple of hundred yards away, and explored it thoroughly.\r\nBut it was in exactly the same condition as their own, so they closed\r\nall the hatches again and then, after a short discussion, decided to\r\nleave the solution of the puzzle of the ships for the present and\r\ndevote the day to the salvage of any necessaries they could discover\r\namong the wreckage.\r\n\r\nThey paddled across to the southern spit which divided the lake from\r\nthe sea, and found it a bare hundred yards in width, and at its highest\r\npoint not more than ten feet above high-water level.  They walked\r\nbriskly along the side of the narrow channel that joined the two lakes,\r\non past the first one, and in a couple of hours reached the sandy point\r\nwhere they had landed two days before.  Out above the piles of wreckage\r\nthe gray cloud of sea-birds swung and whirled, and their shrill\r\nscreamings rose and fell with the varied fortunes of their quest.\r\n\r\n\"Screeching deevils!\" was the mate's comment on them, and presently,\r\n\"It'll be a long pull back with a log of a raft.  It must be six or\r\nseven miles, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we'll strike a boat among the wreckage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--p'r'aps.  We do have the deil's own luck.\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost dead low water.  The storm of the previous days seemed to\r\nhave exhausted the elements for the time being.  The sea was smooth,\r\nwith no more movement than the long slow heave which curled, as it\r\nneared the shore, into great green and white combers of exquisite\r\nbeauty, rushing up the beaches in a dapple of marbled foam, and back\r\ninto the bosom of the next comer with a long-drawn sibilant hiss.\r\n\r\nThere was a soft south-west wind and even a cheering touch of the sun,\r\nand as their work was like to be of the wettest, and dry clothes were a\r\nluxury, they left them above tide-level and went out stripped to the\r\nfight, their only weapon the mate's sailor's-knife in the belt which he\r\nbuckled round his waist.  But, in view of the screeching deevils\r\nalready in possession, they forethoughtfully armed themselves with the\r\nweightiest clubs they could pick out of the raffle of the beach.  For\r\nin that countless predatory host, although its components were but\r\nbirds, there was menace passing words.  It made them feel bare and\r\nvulnerable, and Macro cursed them heartily as he went.\r\n\r\nThey reached the pile without any difficulty, and the mate's keen eye\r\nraked round for the likeliest stuff for a raft.  It was no good\r\nacquiring cargo till they had a craft to carry it.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of timber, however, and cordage was to be had for the\r\ncutting, and with these the skilled hands of the seaman soon\r\nconstructed a raft large enough for their utmost probable requirements.\r\nThen he turned with gusto to the more satisfying joys of plunder, and\r\ndeveloped new and startling sides to his character.\r\n\r\nWulf laughed, but found him surprising, as the cateran spirit of his\r\nforebears came uppermost with this tremendous opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe climbed up and down and in and out of the high-piled wreckage like a\r\nhungry tiger, bashed in boxes and cases with a huge club of mahogany\r\nwhich had once adorned the cabin-staircase of a ship, and raked over\r\ntheir contents with the avidious claws of a wrecker of the evil coasts.\r\nNow and again strange ejaculations broke from him.  More than once, in\r\nthe wild glee of pillage and unexpected booty, he shouted snatches of\r\nweird runes and chanties which Wulf supposed were Gaelic.  At times he\r\nstood and shook his fist at the screaming birds that swooped about him,\r\nand cursed them volubly.  And once, Wulfrey, on the raft below, knitted\r\nhis brows and watched him with doubtful perplexity as, in the\r\ndisappointment of his hopes respecting one great case which had\r\nresisted his efforts and finally yielded nothing of consequence, he\r\nattacked another with shouts of fury and a Berserk madness that\r\nscattered chips and splinters far and wide.  An incautious cormorant\r\nswooped by him.  With a stroke he sent it spinning, a bruised and\r\nbroken bundle of feathers, and it fell with a dull flop into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe man seemed demented, drunk with a rage for plunder and the\r\ndestruction of everything that stood between him and it.  His great\r\nclub whirled, and the blows flailed here and there without any apparent\r\nregard to direction.  The lust of slaughter and demolishment burst from\r\nhim in volcanic fire and fury.  For the moment he had reverted to his\r\nelemental type.\r\n\r\nTo the cooler head below he looked dangerous.  Wulfrey's amused\r\namazement gave place to doubt and a touch of anxiety.  He could only\r\nhope that his companion was not often subject to fits such as this.\r\n\r\nBut the Berserk madness was not wholly without method, and presently\r\nplunder of all kinds came raining down on the raft.\r\n\r\nHeralded by a sharp \"Below there!\" came a roll of linen and one of\r\nwoollen cloth, a bale of blankets, more rolls,--this time of silk and\r\nsatin and velvet, all more or less damaged by the sea, though they were\r\nthe pick and cream of his salvaging, and all no doubt dryable.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!  What does he want with these?\" thought Wulfrey, but\r\npiled them up obediently.\r\n\r\nThen, following the unmistakable course of the marauder up above, and\r\nclawing the raft along to keep in touch with him, down came on his head\r\na bulging little sack, which felt like beans but proved to be coffee,\r\nand presently, after a pause, necessitated by packing arrangements up\r\nabove, a series of soft bundles made up in crimson silk and tied with\r\nslimy rope.\r\n\r\nThen, after another pause punctuated by shouts and crashes, down came a\r\nrattling heap of rusty cooking utensils all slung together with more\r\nslimy rope, a rusty axe, four broken oars.  Till at last the raft\r\nbecame so crowded that there was barely standing room left on it.\r\n\r\n\"Steady, above there!  We're full up.  I can't take another pound, and\r\nI doubt if we can get this all home safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just this, man!\" and Macro appeared up above with a small keg in his\r\narms, and let himself and it carefully down on to the raft, with every\r\nappearance of a return to sanity.\r\n\r\n\"Man!\" he said, with the afterglow of it all still in his face.  \"That\r\nwas fine.  We'll come again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get all these things home first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy that.  This wind'll carry us fine,\" and he set to work with a\r\ncouple of the broken oars and a blanket, and contrived a sail of sorts.\r\nThen, taking another oar and thrusting one into Wulfrey's hands, he\r\npropelled the clumsy raft along the side of the wreckage till it got\r\nclear, and the wind caught their sail and wafted them slowly towards\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\"A grand grand place, yon!\" he broke out again.\r\n\r\n\"There's stuff enough there to load a hundred ships....  Gosh, I've\r\nforgotten the pork!\" and he uprooted the sail and began paddling back\r\nto the wreckage.  \"I stove in the head of a barrel and was smelling at\r\nit when I spied the wee keg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it eatable?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've eaten worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we get it next trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, my stomach's been crying for it ever since I set eyes on it.\r\n'Sides, those deevils of birds will finish it in no time.  See them!\r\nThey're at it now.  Och, ye greedy deevils!\"\r\n\r\nHe clambered up the pile with his oar and laid about him lustily, The\r\nbirds rose up from the meat like a dense cloud of flies, and screamed\r\nand raved at him, and swooped at him with vicious eyes and beaks and\r\nclaws, so that in a moment he became the centre of a writhing,\r\nfluttering, shrieking mass which threatened to annihilate him\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nHe flailed blindly at them with his oar, smashing them by dozens.  But\r\nthey were too many for him.  He shouted for help, and when Wulfrey\r\nscrambled up he found him in very sore case, fighting blindly and\r\nstreaming with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Come away, man!\" shouted Wulfrey, and thrashed away at the nightmare\r\nof whirling birds.  \"Come away before they end us!\" and in a moment he\r\nfound himself the centre of a similar shrieking mass, dazed and blinded\r\nwith their numbers and their fury.  The terrified glimpse he got of\r\ntheir cold glittering eyes and gnashing beaks, and the compressed venom\r\nof their overwhelming assault, were too much for him.  It was like\r\nfighting single-handed against all the fiends out of the pit.\r\n\r\nHe hurled his oar overboard, put up his arms to protect his eyes, and\r\nstaggered to the edge of the pile, acutely conscious of jags and pecks\r\nand rips innumerable on his bare arms and shoulders.  As he flung\r\nhimself down into the water and dived under, a plunge alongside told\r\nhim that Macro had done the same.  A raucous swarm of birds followed\r\nthem, but on their disappearance fluttered off to more visible chances\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\"Man! but that was awful!\" gasped the mate hoarsely.  \"They nigh ate me\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get aboard or they'll be at us again.  There's my oar,\" and he\r\nswam quietly to it and they climbed back on to the raft.\r\n\r\n\"An' never ae piece o' pork,\" lamented Macro.  \"The poaching deevils!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be thankful you're alive, man!  It was a close touch that.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twas that.  I'm bit all over.  I'd like to end 'em all with one\r\ncrack.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the birds were too busy quarrelling up above to give them\r\nmore than cursory attention.  A few came whirling and swooping after\r\nthem with greedy eyes and ravening beaks.  But it was only in their\r\nmultitudes that they were formidable and they soon gave up a chase that\r\noffered no easy prey.\r\n\r\nThe men, shaken and trembling, clawed along the pile till they caught\r\nthe wind again, when Macro readjusted his masts and sail, and they\r\ndrifted slowly back towards the island.\r\n\r\n\"Ye deevils!  Ye scratching, scrawming, skelloching deevils!\" breathed\r\nMacro deeply, every now and again, and shook his fist at the twisting\r\ncolumn of birds behind.  \"I wish ye had ae neck and me ma hond on it.\"\r\n\r\nTheir weighty progress was of the slowest.  When they drew alongside\r\nthe yellow spit Macro plunged overboard and waded ashore for their\r\nclothes, and they drifted on along the low southern beach.  But it was\r\nwell after mid-day before they came abreast of the stark little ships\r\nwhich stood to them for home.\r\n\r\nThen they made busy traffic transporting their salvage to the shore and\r\ncarrying it across the bank to the edge of the lake.  And when that was\r\nall done Macro unlashed the raft and they carried it over piece by\r\npiece, and roughly put it together there and loaded up again.\r\n\r\n\"It'll all come in for firing,\" said the mate.  \"We can't go on burning\r\nour own inside all the time.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no easy work propelling their rough craft with broken oars.\r\nMoreover Macro insisted on taking the hatch-cover in tow.  But the\r\nspirit of accomplishment was upon them and the weight they dragged was\r\na comforting one.\r\n\r\nAll the way, as they joggled slowly along, the mate never ceased\r\nenlarging on the wonders of the wreckage, nor forgot his one\r\ndisappointment, which evoked resentful curses each time he thought of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Man, but we're doing fine!  A roof we've got, and fire, and things to\r\neat.--There's flour in yon bundles,--just the cores of half a dozen\r\ncasks.  And yon bag's coffee, but we'll need to roast it and grind it.\r\nAnd the wee keg's rum, unless I've mistook it.  An' there's enough\r\nstuff out yonder to last us for a thousand years.  But,\r\nblankety-blank-blank-blank!--my stomach's crying after yon pork that\r\nthem screeching deevils took out of our mouths, as you might say.\r\nBlankety-blank-blank 'em all--every red-eyed son o' the pit among 'em!\r\nBut we'll try again, and next time I'll not broach the barr'l an'\r\nthey'll know noth'n about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they'll attack us all the same.  It was the most horrible\r\nsituation I was ever in.  One felt so utterly helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, blank 'em!  There was no end to 'em....  They'd have ate me alive\r\nif you hadn't come and helped me tumble overboard.  Blank 'em!  Blank\r\n'em!  Blank 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth are all these things for?\" asked Wulfrey one time,\r\nkicking a roll of crimson silk with his heel.\r\n\r\n\"Blankets to sleep on,--better than boards.  The others for their gay\r\ngaudery,--the bonny reid and blue o' them.  They mek me feel good and\r\nwarm just to look at 'em.  I just couldna leave them.  Man, they're\r\ngrand!\"\r\n\r\nThey hoisted all their stuff on board, and found themselves hungry and\r\nthirsty with the heavy day's work.  There were but the scantiest\r\nremnants of their breakfast left, and Macro undertook to chop wood and\r\nmake a fire, scour some of the rusty cooking-utensils, and make\r\nflour-and-water cakes as soon as he had some water, if Wulfrey would go\r\nacross for it and some fresh meat.\r\n\r\nSo he set off on the hatch-cover with a good-sized kettle, and was back\r\ninside an hour with water from the ponds by the hill and a couple of\r\nyoung rabbits, and found that the mate had not been idle.  He had\r\ntransferred a sufficiency of sand to the cabin to make a hearth at the\r\nfoot of the steps, and had broken up wood enough to last for a week.\r\nHe had spread out all the blankets, scoured most of the rust off a\r\nfrying-pan and a small kettle and a couple of tin pannikins, and had\r\nopened the keg and sampled its contents and found it French cognac of\r\nexcellent quality.\r\n\r\nIn the best of spirits he skinned the rabbits and set them roasting,\r\nwith an incidental commination of thae screeching deevils that had\r\nrobbed them of the pork which would have been such a welcome\r\naccompaniment.  Then he compounded cakes of flour and water and fried\r\nthem deftly, and set a kettle to boil wherewith to make hot grog, and\r\nboastfully promised coffee for the morrow when he had time to roast and\r\ngrind it.\r\n\r\nThey both ate ravenously, and found great content in the taste of hot\r\nfood and drink once more, after all these days of clammy starvation,\r\nand then they slept.  And Wulfrey dreamed horribly all night of\r\nfighting helplessly with legions of screeching birds, and several times\r\nfought himself awake, and each time found Macro actively engaged in the\r\nsame unprofitable business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nIn spite of his torn shoulders and unrestful night, Macro was for\r\nsetting off again first thing next morning for more plunder.  That huge\r\npile of wastry drew him like a magnet.  He hungered and thirsted to be\r\nat it again.\r\n\r\nBut Wulfrey flatly refused.  They had enough to go on with, and he\r\nclaimed at least a day to recover from the effects of the last\r\nexcursion.  And as Macro declined to tackle the job single-handed he\r\nwas fain to agree, though with none too good a grace.\r\n\r\n\"This weather mayn't last.  We'd best get all we can while we can,\" he\r\nurged.\r\n\r\n\"The stuff will be there tomorrow.  Most of it's been there for years,\r\nyou said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but man, there's mebbe things out of the 'Grassadoo,' that'll be\r\nspoiling for want of finding.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll not spoil much more in one day.  You're more used to this kind\r\nof work than I am, you see.  I must have a rest.\"\r\n\r\nMacro consigned rest to the bottomless pit, but after relieving his\r\nfeelings in that way, consented at last to an easy-going exploration of\r\nthe southern spit, to see if their lake opened into the sea, though he\r\nexpressed himself satisfied, from his observations, that it did not.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, out of the larger raft he constructed a smaller one,\r\nwhich bore them better than the hatch-cover and was more manageable,\r\nand the hatch they hauled on board again and fitted into its place, so\r\nas to keep the ship dry in case of bad weather.  Then they paddled\r\nacross to the spit and set off along it, both scrutinising the lie of\r\nthe land carefully.\r\n\r\nFor a good hour they trudged through heavy sand, the sea swirling with\r\nlong soft hisses up the yellow beach on their right hand, and on their\r\nleft the placid water of the lake without a pulse in it.  The dividing\r\nbank was nowhere in all its length more than a hundred yards wide, nor\r\nmore than ten feet high at its crown.\r\n\r\nMore than once Macro stood and studied it in places, and when in time\r\nthey came to long ridges of hummocks which stretched as far in front as\r\nthey could see, he stood again, looking back from the top of the first\r\nthey climbed, and said, \"I'm thinking there's no opening this end.\r\nMebbe it was on the level there.  But this stuff shifts so in a gale\r\nyou never know where you are.\"\r\n\r\nPresently they came on the shallow rounded end of the lake, with higher\r\nsandhills beyond it, which ran along both sides of the island further\r\nthan they could see.  In between lay a vast unbroken stretch of level\r\nsand, and when they climbed to the top of the highest hill, they saw\r\nthis sandy desert dwindle in the far distance to a point, with the sea\r\non each side of it, like the one at the other end of the island.\r\n\r\n\"There's not a sign of anybody else,\" said Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"If there'd been anyone they'd bin living on them ships.  We've got it\r\nall to ourselves, that's certain.  And what's more, we'll have it all\r\nto ourselves till Kingdom come.  No one else'll ever come, 'cept dead\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those two ships came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty, thirty years ago,--mebbe more.  Must have bin an opening then\r\nand it's got silted up.  They couldn't have got washed over the spit.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several more large fresh-water ponds close to these larger\r\nhills, and rabbits everywhere.  They secured a couple and tramped back\r\nthe way they had come.\r\n\r\nMacro seemed to accept the whole situation and outlook with the utmost\r\nequanimity.  They had very much more than they had had any right to\r\nexpect; more was always to be had for the fetching from that wonderful\r\npile out yonder; what that pile might yield in the way of richer\r\nplunder remained to be seen, and he was the man to see to it.\r\n\r\nBut Wulfrey had been cherishing a hope that the great lake would prove\r\nan inlet from the sea, a harbour of refuge into which other ships might\r\nbe expected to run at times.  And the fact that it was not, that no\r\nrelief was to be looked for in that direction and that this desolate\r\nsandbank, bristling with wrecks, must necessarily be shunned by all who\r\nknew of it, weighed more and more heavily on him as he thought about it.\r\n\r\nThey were alive, where all their shipmates had perished.  They were\r\nprovided for beyond their utmost expectation.  For all that he was most\r\ndeeply grateful.  But the prospect of passing the rest of his life on\r\nthis bare bank troubled him profoundly and reduced him to silence and\r\nthe lowest of spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nThey woke next morning into a dense white fog, so thick that they could\r\nnot see across the deck.  Macro, intent on plunder, hailed it as an\r\nexcellent screen from possible attack by the other pillagers of the\r\nwreck-pile, and though Wulfrey had his doubts, he would not counter him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of human nature suggested to him the almost impossibility\r\nof two men living alone, in intimacy so close and exclusive, and with\r\nso little outlet for their thoughts and energies, without coming to\r\nloggerheads at times.  He determined that, so far as in him lay, the\r\nprovocation thereto should not come from him.\r\n\r\nSo far he had not only had nothing to complain of in his companion's\r\npresence, but, on the contrary, had found himself distinctly the gainer\r\nby it in every material way.  But the strange wild outbursts, to which\r\nhe had given vent when they were at the wreckage before, warned him of\r\nhidden fires below, and suggested the advisability of non-provocation\r\nof the under-man, if it were possible to avoid it.\r\n\r\nSo they paddled across to the spit, which they could not well miss, and\r\nset off on foot for the point, steering by the sullen lap and hiss of\r\nthe waves as they stole softly up out of the fog on their left hand.\r\nThere was a clamminess in the air which commended the idea of clothes\r\nto them while they worked on the pile.  So they made their things into\r\ntight bundles, and carried them above their heads as they waded out\r\nneck-deep to their store-house.  The shrill cries of the birds came\r\ndull and thin through the fog, more ghostly than ever from their\r\ninvisibility.  Now and again an inquisitive straggler fluttered down at\r\nthem out of the close white curtain, and whirled back into it with a\r\nterrified squawk when it found they were alive.\r\n\r\nThey climbed the pile cautiously, but the birds seemed mostly at a\r\ndistance; and when they had flung down sufficient timber Macro\r\nproceeded to construct another raft, while Wulfrey poked about up above\r\non his own account.\r\n\r\nAnd as he climbed about among the chaotic mass of barrels, boxes,\r\ncases, bales, he came to understand the wild craving to get at them, to\r\nbash them open and learn what they contained, which had possessed the\r\nmate that other day.  There might be anything hidden there--goods of\r\nall kinds for the easement of their present situation.  There might\r\neven be treasure of gold and jewels.  It was impossible to say what\r\nthere might not be.  And though gold and jewels were absolutely useless\r\nto them, placed as they were, and with no prospect, according to Macro,\r\nof rescue or relief, the possibility of such things lying hidden in\r\nuntold quantity all about him stirred him strangely.\r\n\r\nHe recognised feelings so abnormal to himself with no little surprise.\r\nHe felt as a penniless small boy might feel if he were given the\r\nfreedom of a great shop full of boxed-up toys and told to help himself.\r\nHe wanted to smash open very closed case he came to, to see what was\r\ninside it.\r\n\r\nThe water lapped and clunked dismally in the hollows below, and at\r\ntimes he had to climb almost down to it, and then up the further side,\r\nto get across faults in the pile.  In one such black gully, on what was\r\nusually the leeward side of the pile, he had stepped cautiously from\r\nledge to ledge, and laid hold of a projecting spar and was hauling\r\nhimself up the other side, when he came face up against a dark little\r\ncranny between two great cases.  And in the niche sat the skeleton of a\r\nman, all huddled up and jammed together, but grinning at him in so\r\nferociously jovial a manner, as though he had been expecting him and\r\nwas rejoiced at the sight of him, that Wulfrey came near to loosing his\r\nhold and falling into the water.  He scrambled hastily past, and saw\r\ngrinning faces in every dark corner for the rest of the day, and some\r\nof them were fact and some were only fancy.  For the tumbled pile of\r\nwreckage was like a huge trap for the catching of anything the sweeping\r\ngales might bring it.\r\n\r\nHe heard Macro's voice, dulled by the mist, calling to him, and he\r\nanswered but knew not which way to go to get to him.  It was only by\r\nconstant shouting and long and precarious scrambling that they came\r\ntogether again.\r\n\r\n\"We'd best keep close in this fog,\" said the mate, \"or one of us'll be\r\nstopping the night here.  Found anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dead man----\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he was only bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's full of 'em.  They're no canny, but they'll not harm us.\r\nWhere'll we begin?\"\r\n\r\n\"One place is as good as another.  Here, I should say, and quietly, or\r\nthose fiends of birds will be at us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand with this, then,\" laying hold of a newly-stranded barrel.\r\n\"That's pork out of the 'Grassadoo,' so it'll be all right,\" and\r\nheaving and hauling, they managed to get the barrel down on to the raft.\r\n\r\nAs they poked about the pile in the mist, it was evident they had\r\nstruck a spot where a good portion of the contents of the\r\n'Grace-a-Dieu' had lodged.  Macro, having superintended the loading,\r\nrecognised many of the marks and in some instances could recall their\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n\"Women's fallals,\" he said, with a scornful crack at one large case.\r\n\"If they'd been men's, now, they'd have come in handy....  Boots and\r\nshoes, if I remember rightly,\"--nodding at another case.  \"We'll soon\r\nsee,\" and with a chunk of wood he stove in one side and hauled out a\r\nhandful of its contents.--\"Women's troke again!  Mebbe we'll find some\r\nmen's stuff in time....  I've seen yon chest before....  Old Will\r\nTaggart's, I think,\" and he stove it open, and went down on his knees\r\nand raked over the contents.  \"Seaman's slops, not much account....  A\r\nnew pipe and a tin of tobacco!  Thanks be!  We'll take that ... and\r\nanother flint and steel.  Always useful! ... Clothes not much good, but\r\nwe might be glad of 'em later on....  Yon's a box of tea and it'll be\r\nlead-lined inside.  Should be more about.  We had two hunderd\r\naboard....  Glory! yon barrels are hard-tack.  These ones are flour.\r\nIf we work hard and get 'em ashore before the weather breaks again\r\nwe'll live in clover....  What's this now? ... 'Duke of Kent'\"--and he\r\nhauled up a stout wooden box by one handle out of a raffle of cordage\r\nand ragged sail-cloth.  \"Name of a ship--or name of a man?  That's no a\r\nship's box.\"\r\n\r\nA deft blow under the lock and the box lay open, displaying a number of\r\nuniforms, richly decorated with gold braid and lacing, all more or less\r\ndamaged by water, but otherwise in good condition.\r\n\r\n\"Duds enough to keep us going for a couple of years if so be as they\r\nfit,\" said the mate exuberantly, and Wulfrey laughed out at the idea of\r\ntheir peacocking about their sandbank rigged out in court costumes.\r\n\r\n\"He was Governor-General of Canada,\" he said.  \"I remember hearing he\r\nlost his baggage on the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be Governor-Generals here when we're needing a change....\r\nNothing but his clothes,\" as he ran his hands all over the box.  \"Mebbe\r\nwe'll find more of 'em lying about.  Man! what a place it is!  It'd\r\ntake a man a lifetime to work through all the stuff there is here.\"\r\n\r\nThey worked hard and carried home a huge load, but as there was no wind\r\nthey had to paddle all the way, and even Macro acknowledged to being a\r\nbit tired before they got all their plunder across the spit and on\r\nboard, the transit across the lake on the smaller raft necessitating\r\nthree separate journeys.  He was in the highest of spirits however, and\r\nkeen to be back at the pile next day.  As for Wulfrey, hardening though\r\nhe was with all these unusual labours, he found himself almost too\r\nweary to eat.\r\n\r\nThe fog lay on them like a white pall for six days.  Macro predicted\r\nthat it would go in a storm, and was urgent on salvaging all they could\r\nbefore it came.\r\n\r\nSo, day after day, they went out to the pile, and came back loaded at\r\nnight till they had stuff enough in their hold to keep them in comfort\r\nfor many months to come.\r\n\r\nThey had meat and drink, clothes and firing, and comfortable quarters.\r\nWhat more could any man want, unless it were to get away from it all?\r\nAnd that, the mate asserted, time after time, was the unlikeliest thing\r\nthat could happen.\r\n\r\n\"We're here till Kingdom come,\" was the burden of his tune.  \"So we may\r\nas well be comfortable.  And we've had the deil's own luck.  We might\r\nha' been living on rabbits and roots, and sleeping on the sand.  Man!\r\nbe thankful at being tired to such good purpose!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thankful enough and tired enough, and we've got stuff enough for a\r\nyear.  I'm going to take a rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm for the pile again tomorrow.  If you won't come I'll e'en make\r\nshift alone,\" and Wulfrey let him go alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nThe smothering white fog lay thick on them for six days and then\r\ndisappeared in the night.  The morning broke dull and heavy, with a\r\ngusty wind from the south-west, and they could hear the waves breaking\r\non the spit with a sound like the low growl of a menacing beast.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off to the pile,\" said the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Better take a day off.  You've been working too hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me.  I cannot sit here while all yon stuff's crying aloud to be\r\npicked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be on the look-out, and come across to give you a hand from\r\nthe spit when you get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll lash you up a bit float that'll bring you over, before I go.  And\r\nyou'll mebbe have some food ready against I get back.  It's hungry work\r\nout there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be ready for you.  If you load up too heavily you'll not get back\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see to that.  Wind's fair, it'll bring me home all right.\"\r\n\r\nSo Wulfrey had the day to himself, and had time, which the labours of\r\nthe previous days had not permitted him, to consider the situation in\r\nall its aspects.\r\n\r\nSo far they had been marvellously favoured, without doubt.  Ten days\r\nago they were swinging up and down on the galley-roof inside the cage\r\nof the dead ship's ribs, possessed of nothing but their bare lives, and\r\nthose but doubtfully.  And here they were, provided for in every\r\nrespect, with comforts which shipwrecked men had no right to expect,\r\nand with unlimited further stores to draw upon.  They could live\r\nwithout fear....\r\n\r\nBut what a life, after all.  Eating, drinking, sleeping,--raking over\r\nthe wreckage for possible plunder that was useless to them,--rambling\r\namong the rabbits and the sandhills.  Quarrelling in time, maybe.\r\nPerhaps it was a good thing there was a ship for each of them.\r\n\r\nHe was not himself of a quarrelsome disposition.  The mate, he thought,\r\nmight be difficult to put up with if he took a crooked turn.  But it\r\nwould be the height of folly for two men, bound together by\r\nill-fortune, and to this bare bank for all time, to fall out.  Every\r\ncircumspection within his power he resolved to exercise, and so far,\r\nindeed, his companion had given him no cause to mistrust or doubt him.\r\n\r\nBut he had a somewhat discomforting feeling that he knew very little of\r\nthe real man that lay beneath that saturnine exterior, that there might\r\nbe elemental depths there which would surprise him if they came to be\r\nrevealed.  This Macro that he knew was to him something in the nature\r\nof a sleeping volcano, outwardly quiet but full of hidden fires.\r\n\r\nHe could imagine no likely grounds for dispute between them.  Each\r\nworked for the common good, and so far they had shared all things\r\nequally and without question.  But how would it be as the weeks dragged\r\ninto months, and the months into years?\r\n\r\nSo far the rifling of the wreckage had afforded the mate all the outlet\r\nhe needed for his activities.  In ministering to the cravings of the\r\nriever spirit that was strong in him it had also supplied their wants\r\nin overwhelming abundance.  The longer it kept him busy the better, and\r\nif it yielded him plunder of value he was entirely welcome to it.\r\n\r\nWulfrey could not imagine his discovering anything out there which\r\ncould by any possibility lead to any serious difference between them.\r\nAnd yet, in spite of all that, from little glimpses he had caught at\r\ntimes of the strange wild, hidden nature of the man, he was not without\r\ndoubts as to his absolute congeniality as a sole companion for the rest\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nIn short he had a vague feeling that, if by any chance they came to\r\nloggerheads, Macro might prove an extremely unpleasant person to be\r\nshut up with, within bounds so limited as this great bank of sand.\r\n\r\nHe recognised such feelings, however, as unnecessarily morbid, and\r\nascribed them to the general murkiness of the outlook and\r\nover-weariness from the exertions of the last few days.  So he tumbled\r\noverboard on to the new raft and paddled to the nearer shore, and set\r\noff for a brisk walk over the sandhills and along the beach, in search\r\nof a more hopeful frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWhy could they not build a boat?  Macro said the coast of Nova Scotia\r\nwas but a hundred miles or so away.  A hundred miles was no great\r\naffair, and there was wood among that pile enough to build a thousand\r\nboats.  So far, indeed, they had not come upon any tools except the\r\nrusty axe, for tool-chests probably sank at once on the outer banks\r\nwhere the ships went to pieces.\r\n\r\nStill, he would suggest it to Macro.  It might prove a further outlet\r\nfor his energies.  If he should by chance find plunder of value out\r\nthere he might, when he was satiated, favour the idea of an attempt at\r\nescape.  In fact, plunder without any attempt to utilise it would be\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity of making his own position clear, and thereby obviating\r\nany cause for dispute, occurred that same day.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the afternoon, he saw the mate coming slowly along before the\r\nwind, he paddled over to the spit to meet him and found him in great\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\"Man! it's been a great day, and if ye'd been there ye'd have had your\r\nchance.  I lit on some graand things.  Wait while I show you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get 'em all aboard first.  They'll keep, and I'll be bound\r\nyou're tired and hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hungert as a wolf, but finding siccan things takes the tired out o'\r\none,\" and his black eyes sparkled over his finds, and he must go on\r\ntelling about them as they worked.\r\n\r\n\"It was down under where we found yon Duke o' Kent box.  I spied\r\nanother, and then more, mebbe there's, more yet down below.\"\r\n\r\n\"More fancy coats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--and some with jewelled stars on 'em and swords with fancy hilts.\r\nI'll show you when we get aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't come across any tools, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tools?  No.  What would we want tools for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering if it might not be possible to build some kind of a\r\nboat and get across to Nova Scotia.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're safer here than trying that, I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you've got all there is to be got out there you'll want to get\r\nhome and enjoy it----\"\r\n\r\n\"Man!  It'd take a hunderd years to go through it all.  It's bin piling\r\nup there since ever this bank silted up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, we don't want to stop here a hundred years, that's certain.\r\nWhat's the good of it all if you can't make any use of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's graand to handle anyway.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when they had eaten, he opened some of his bundles and displayed\r\nhis treasures,--a jewelled 'George,' roughly cut from some\r\nGarter-knight's court-coat, several smaller decorations, all more or\r\nless ornamented with precious stones, three dress-swords with\r\nmountings, in ivory and gold, a small wooden box lined with sodden blue\r\nvelvet in which were half a dozen rings, some of which from the size of\r\nthe stones and the massiveness of their setting, seemed to Wulfrey of\r\nconsiderable value.\r\n\r\n\"They're worth something, all those,\" said Macro, as he handled them\r\nwith loving exultation.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, if you could get them home and turn them into money.  I don't see\r\nwhat use they're going to be to you here,\" said Wulfrey, fiddling his\r\nown string again.\r\n\r\n\"They're fine to have anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd sooner have another pipe and some more tobacco than the whole of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye can have that too,\" and he rooted in another bundle and produced\r\nboth.  \"They're oot a dead man's chest and they're wet.  But he's no\r\nuse for 'em and they'll dry.  So there ye are.  Ye dinnot care for\r\njewels?\" and he looked at Wulfrey wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"As to that, I don't say I wouldn't pick them up if I came across them,\r\nbut I've no hankering for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye've plenty money of your own, mebbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as I need--if ever I get ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  It meks a difference, ye see.  I never had any to speak of, and\r\nthese bonny sparklers pluck at the heart o' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome to all you can get, as far as I'm concerned----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, man, they're mine, for I found 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they're no use to you unless we can get away from here.  Get\r\nashore and you can turn them to account.  Now why couldn't we build\r\nsome kind of a boat and get across to Nova Scotia?  There's wood enough\r\nand to spare out yonder----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, there's wood, but ef we had the tools 'twould still be no easy\r\nmatter.  An' then ye've got to reckon wi' the weather.  'Twould be a\r\nbad move to spend our time building a boat only to go to the bottom in\r\nher with all the gear we'd gathered.  We're safe here, anyway.  Mebbe\r\nsome day a boat'll come ashore not so broke but we can patch her up....\r\nHow'd ye like to be afloat in a home-made boat a night like this?\"\r\n\r\nFor while they sat, eating and talking, the day had darkened, and now\r\nand again there came a menacing whuffle down the open hatch, and the\r\nlittle ship was filled with a tremulous humming as the rising wind\r\nplayed on their bare masts, and the growl of the spit had deepened into\r\na long hoarse roar.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a bitter bad night I'm thinking.  I saw it coming away out\r\nyonder.  Mebbe it'll add some to our pile of stuff.  Mebbe it'll bring\r\nus a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not hope for either,\" said Wulfrey soberly, \"for that means\r\nmore deaths out yonder----\"\r\n\r\nA long shrill scream outside sent a creepy chill down his spine for a\r\nmoment.  He glanced apprehensively across at Macro in the flickering\r\nlight of the fire, and saw his face livid, his eyes like great black\r\nwells, his jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"The spirits o' the dead!\" jerked the mate.  \"There's a hantle o' them\r\nout there....  They're mebbe after me for these things....\" and he\r\nrocked himself to and fro, where he sat on the floor, and muttered\r\nstrange words,--\"An ainm au Athar, 's an Mhic, 's an Spioraid\r\nNaoimh,\"--in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy\r\nGhost.\r\n\r\nThe weird shrieking waxed louder and shriller.  Wulfrey got up and\r\nclimbed the steps, and found the stormy twilight gray with that vast\r\ncloud of birds, all fleeing blindly before the gale and each one\r\nscreaming its loudest.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearsome, blood-curdling clamour, an ear-splitting\r\npandemonium, a whirling Sabbat, as if all the demons of the pit had\r\nbroken loose and clothed themselves in wings and shrieks and deadly\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\"It's only those damnable birds,\" he bent and shouted gruffly down to\r\nMacro, vexed with himself at his own momentary fright.\r\n\r\nBut the mate was not for accepting any such simple explanation as that.\r\n\r\n\"Man!\" he said hoarsely.  \"Birds ye may think 'em, but I know better.\r\nIt is spirits they are,--spirits of all the dead that ever died in this\r\ndread place,--a great multitude--their bones are white out there, but\r\nthe spirits of them cannot rest.  A Mhoire ghradhach!  'Twas under the\r\nDark Star we were born, and here we'll die and leave our bones to\r\nwhiten in the sand, and the spirits of us will go screeching and\r\nscrauchling wi' the rest.  Come away, man, and shut the doors tight or\r\nthey'll be in on us!\"\r\n\r\nWulfrey had never seen anything like it.  Those myriads of fluttering\r\nwings looked as though the whole gray sky had come tumbling down in\r\nfragments.  It was like a snowstorm on a gigantic scale, every whirling\r\nflake a bundle of wildly screaming feathers.\r\n\r\nHe stood watching for a time and listening to the growing thunder of\r\nthe rollers on the spit.  He imagined their crashing in white foam-fury\r\namong the stark ribs of the dead ships out there on the banks.\r\n\r\nHe shivered as he recalled the chill horrors of their own undoing and\r\ndeliverance.  It was wonderful beyond words, with that in his mind, to\r\nbe standing there, safe and warm, and well provided, and his heart was\r\nfull of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"God help any who are out there this night!\" he said to himself, and\r\nclosed the doors on the storm-fiends, and squatted on the floor over\r\nagainst the mate, who sat rocking slowly to and fro in great discomfort\r\nand muttered Gaelic seuns as a protection against the unholy things\r\nthat wandered outside.\r\n\r\nAll night long their little ship was filled with the hum of the\r\nshuddering masts, broken now and again with the creaking and jerking of\r\ntheir rusty cable.  And whenever Wulfrey, warm in his bunk with many\r\nblankets, woke up for a moment, he heard the deep thunder of the waves\r\non the spit, and the howl of the wind, outside, and the thrashing of\r\nthe rain on deck; and he thanked God for warmth and shelter, and lay\r\nlistening for a moment, and then rolled over and went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nThe storm lasted three full days, during which they never once left the\r\nship.  They had all they needed, and fresh water was obtainable in any\r\nquantity by slinging an empty keg outside one of the scupper-holes\r\nthrough which the rain drained off the deck.\r\n\r\nMacro's gloomy humour lasted, off and on, as long as the storm.  The\r\nbirds had mostly hidden themselves in sheltered nooks among the\r\nsandhills.  But every now and again the evil in them, or maybe it was\r\nhunger, would stir them up and set them whirling and shrieking round\r\nthe ship, and sometimes lighting on it in prodigious numbers, and the\r\nmate would curse them long and deep and fall once more to his spells\r\nand invocations.  The fury of the storm did not trouble him, but the\r\nscreaming of the birds seemed to touch the superstitious spot in his\r\nnature and set all his nerves jangling.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of the lull times that he astonished Wulfrey by\r\nhauling out his rolls of silks and velvets, and with an elemental,\r\nalmost barbaric, delight in their rich colourings, he cut them into\r\nlong strips, which he fixed neatly to the walls of the cabin by means\r\nof wooden pegs.  The gorgeous results afforded him the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, which nothing but the wailing of the birds could damp.\r\nWhenever their shrill clamour broke out the darkness fell on him again.\r\nHe hurled uncouth curses at them and no arguments availed against his\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nTo Wulfrey, on the other hand, the birds and their dismal shriekings\r\nwere but an incident, the fury of the storm a wonder and a revelation.\r\n\r\nAll through that former time of stress, which had ended in their\r\nundoing, his powers of observation and appreciation had been dulled by\r\nhis fears of disaster.  Then, the howl of the gale and the onslaught of\r\nthe seas had been like hungry deaths close at his heels.  But here, in\r\nthe perfect security of the land-locked lake, he was free to watch and\r\nto wonder.\r\n\r\nAt times, indeed, it seemed to him that the terrible force of the wind\r\nmight lift them bodily, ship and all, and hurl them into the turmoil\r\nbeyond.  Then he remembered that many such storms must have swept the\r\nisland and still the ships were there.\r\n\r\nThe waves that broke on the spit seemed to him higher than tall houses,\r\nand the weight of them, as they curled and crashed on the sand, made\r\nthe whole island tremble, he was certain.  The uproar was deafening,\r\nand at times great lashes of white spray came hurtling over into the\r\nlake, and scourging it into sizable waves of its own.\r\n\r\nWhen Wulfrey woke on the fourth morning he was conscious of a change,\r\nand running up on deck he found the sun shining in a pale-blue,\r\nstorm-washed sky, and nothing left of the gale but the great green\r\nwaves breaking sullenly on the beach beyond the spit.\r\n\r\nHe stripped and plunged overboard, and climbed up again full of the joy\r\nof life and physical fitness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nThe days crept into weeks, the weeks into months, with nothing to break\r\nthe monotony of their life but visits to the wreckage, an occasional\r\nskirmish with the birds, rabbit-hunts, rude attempts at fishing, which\r\nmet with so little success from lack of anything approaching proper\r\nmaterial that they gave it up in disgust, and rambles among the\r\nsandhills.\r\n\r\nThey got along companionably enough; the mate's only complaint,--and\r\nthat not untinged with satisfaction, and obviously prompted more by a\r\ndesire for his help than from any wish to halve his spoils--that\r\nWulfrey showed so poor a spirit in the matter of plunder, and so\r\nshamefully neglected the opportunities of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nFor himself, if he could have found safe lodging out there, he would\r\nhave lived on the wreck-pile, to save the time and trouble of going to\r\nand fro.  The riever spirit of his forefathers was kept at\r\nboiling-point by the possibilities of fortune which lurked there.  The\r\nsearch in itself at once satisfied and stimulated the natural craving\r\nfor booty which rioted in his Highland-Spanish blood, and he never\r\ntired of it.\r\n\r\nHe came back laden every time with things for the common good, and\r\nrarer pickings for his private hoard, over which he exulted like a\r\nchieftain returned from a successful foray.\r\n\r\nWulfrey was on the whole not ungrateful to the pile for affording him\r\nsuch distraction.  He discussed the latest additions to his\r\ntreasure-trove with him, as they sat by the fire of a night, and\r\nspeculated with him on their probable origin and value, and the higher\r\nhe assessed this the more the mate's black eyes glowed.\r\n\r\nHe would sit watching Wulfrey as he turned the latest find over and\r\nover, and weighed it in his hand, and polished a bit of it to get at\r\nits basic metal, and mused on its shape and endeavoured to arrive at\r\nits history.  And at such times there was in the sombre black eyes\r\nsomething of the look of an uncertain-tempered dog whose lawful bone is\r\nin jeopardy.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, Wulfrey, glancing up as he passed an opinion, caught\r\nthat curious suspicious look bent on him, and was amused and annoyed at\r\nit, and also somewhat discomfited.  Did the man think he coveted his\r\nuseless little gauds?--useless in their present extremity, though some\r\nof them doubtless valuable enough if they could be sold.  Why, he\r\nesteemed a dryable twist of tobacco infinitely more highly than any\r\nsilver candlestick or shapely silver cup that the other could fish up\r\nfrom the depths.  It seemed to him just as well that the plunder-fever\r\nhad attacked only one of them, for he doubted if his companion would\r\nwillingly have shared with another.  For the fever grew with his finds.\r\n\r\nOnce they came within an ace of a quarrel, and though it blew over, the\r\nseeds remained.\r\n\r\nWhere the mate hid his spoil, Wulfrey neither knew nor cared nor ever\r\ntroubled his head about.  He would no more have occupied his thoughts\r\nwith it than he would have taken more than his proper share of the food\r\nor tobacco.\r\n\r\nBut increase breeds suspicion, and suspicion clouds the outlook.  Among\r\nother things, Macro one day brought home a small crucifix and some\r\nstrings of beads, which he believed to be of gold, while Wulfrey, from\r\ntheir hardness to the touch of the knife, pronounced them only brass.\r\nThey were all curiously carved or cast, however, and, whatever the\r\nmetal of which they were made, he expressed his admiration of the\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nA night or two later, to his amazement, Macro came out of his own cabin\r\nmore black-a-vised than he had ever seen him, and asked abruptly,\r\n\"Where's that cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"What cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what cross.  Yon gold cross I showed you two nights ago.\r\nWhere is it?\" and he lowered at Wulfrey like a full-charged\r\nthunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of your cross, man.  I suppose you put it with the rest\r\nof your things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did that, and it's gone.  Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak to me like that, Macro.  I won't have it.  I know nothing\r\nabout your cross or any of your plunder.  I've told you before, it is\r\nnothing to me.  If I wanted it I'd go and get it for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was there with the rest and it's no there now.  And----\"\r\n\r\n\"---- ---- ----!\" cried Wulfrey, springing up ablaze with indignation.\r\n\"Do you dare to think I would touch your dirty pilferings?\" and it\r\nlooked as though the next instant would find them at grips.\r\n\r\nBut the mate had broken out in the sudden discovery of his loss.  Wulf\r\nstood full as tall as himself.  He looked very fit and capable, and\r\nlooked, moreover, as the mate's common sense told him, as soon as it\r\ngot the chance, the last person in the world to tamper with another\r\nman's goods--even though he might be the only one circumstantially able\r\nto have done so.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone anyway,\" he growled.  \"But it's no good fighting about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not enough.  Your greed for gain has blinded you.  Till you\r\ncome to your senses I've nothing more to do with you,\" and for two days\r\nnot a word passed between them.\r\n\r\nEach prepared his own food as and when he chose, and ate it apart from\r\nthe other.  The mate hung about as though loth to leave Wulfrey in sole\r\ncharge at home, and the atmosphere of the little cabin was murky and\r\ncharged with lightning.\r\n\r\nOn the third day Wulfrey ostentatiously set off for the wreck-pile by\r\nhimself.  He was running out of tobacco and would not have accepted any\r\nfrom the mate if it had been offered.\r\n\r\nHe waded out, made a rough raft on Macro's lines, and smashed open such\r\nseamen's chests as he could discover, for it was always in them that\r\nthey found tobacco.\r\n\r\nHe got several small lots, and a couple of new pipes, and a flint and\r\nsteel, charged his raft with a keg of rum and a case of hard-tack, and\r\nmanaged to get it all back to the spit and to the ship single-handed.\r\n\r\nAs he came up the side, the mate met him, with the missing crucifix in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"The little deevil of a thing,\" he said, with quite unconscious\r\nincongruity, \"had slipped down a crack, back o' the locker, and I were\r\nwrong to think ye could have taken it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't play the fool again,\" said Wulfrey shortly.  \"If your\r\ngreed for other folk's goods hadn't blinded you, you would understand\r\nthat a gentleman does not stoop to stealing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen some I wouldn't trust further'n I could see 'em, and then\r\nonly if their hands were up over their heads.  But ye're not that kind,\r\nan' I was wrong.  So there 'tis, an' no more to be said.  What have ye\r\nfound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pipes and tobacco.  That is all I went for.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his two days of enforced silence Macro was inclined to expand,\r\nbut found his advances coldly received.  Wulfrey's pride was in arms\r\nand the insult rankled.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, however, the storm-cloud drifted by, and matters between\r\nthem became again much as they had been, with somewhat of added\r\nknowledge, on each side, of the character of the other.\r\n\r\nThe mate had learned that the Doctor, quiet as he might appear, was not\r\na man to suffer injustice or to be meddled with.  And Wulfrey had got a\r\nfurther warning of the possibilities of trouble should he and the mate\r\ncome to serious differences.\r\n\r\nIt seemed absurd that two men, stranded, perhaps for life, on this bare\r\nsandbank, should be unable to live together in amity.  Yet, his\r\nexperience of men told him that it was just such enforced close\r\nintimacy--the constant rubbing together of very divergent natures, with\r\nnothing in common between them but the necessities entailed by their\r\ncommon misfortune--that might, nay almost certainly must, come to\r\nexplosion at times, unless they both set themselves sedulously to the\r\nkeeping of the peace.\r\n\r\nIf any actual rupture took place between them, he foresaw that the mate\r\nmight develop phases of character which would be exceedingly awkward\r\nand difficult to deal with.  Freedom from all the ordinary restraints\r\nwhich civilisation imposed upon the natural inner man might easily run\r\nto wildest licence.\r\n\r\nAt bottom this man was just a wild Highland cateran with a dash of\r\nSpanish buccaneer, hot-blooded, avid of gain under circumstances so\r\npropitious, insatiable.  The chance of a lifetime had come to him and\r\nhe was exultantly set on making the most of it.  He was like a\r\ncage-bred wolf set down suddenly into the midst of an unprotected flock\r\nof sheep.  There was his natural prey in profusion and there was none\r\nto stay him.  To be dropped unexpectedly on to this enormous pile of\r\nplunder was like the realisation of a fairy tale.  No wonder he was\r\ninclined to lose his head.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate, thought Wulfrey, that they were built on different\r\nlines, and that the plunder-pile made absolutely no appeal to himself\r\nbeyond the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nHe determined, as far as in him lay, to walk warily and to avoid, as\r\nfar as possible, any just cause of offence on his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nBONE OF CONTENTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nThey had been three months on the island, and in all that time had\r\nnever sighted a living ship, though the remains of newly-dead ones were\r\nnever wanting after bad weather.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the men of the sea avoided Sable Island as if it\r\nwere a pestilence, and came there only when it no longer mattered to\r\nthem whether they came there or not.\r\n\r\nMacro was, by degrees and with never-lessening enjoyment, amassing a\r\nvery considerable treasure.  If ever the chance of getting back to land\r\narrived, and he could get his plunder home, he would have no need to\r\nfollow the sea for the rest of his life.  But, whether or not that\r\ncrowning good fortune should ever be his, this gathering of spoil was a\r\nhuge satisfaction to the very soul of him, and he desired no better.\r\n\r\nThe only flies in his big honey-pot were those rival depredators the\r\nbirds.  He had many a battle royal with them, and came home at times\r\nscratched and clawed and furiously comminative, consigning birds of all\r\nshapes and sizes to everlasting perdition.  Spirits or no spirits, in\r\nthe day time, and in the prosecution of his work, he would fight them\r\nvaliantly or trick them cleverly.\r\n\r\nBut in the black storms that swept over them at times, when the great\r\nwaves crashed like thunder on the spit, and the sandhills and hummocks\r\nmelted away under Wulfrey's wondering eyes and built themselves afresh\r\nin new places, when the shrieking hosts came whirling round the ship\r\nand the sky was full of their raucous clamour, then the darkness came\r\non Macro and he fell again to his seuns, and knew them, beyond all\r\ndoubt, for things of evil.\r\n\r\nWhen the odds out there on the wreck-pile were too much for him, he\r\nlearned by experience how to fool them.  He would smash furiously at\r\nthem with his club, shouting in wild exultation as the bashed bodies\r\nwent tumbling into the sea.  If that did not discourage them, and their\r\nvenom persisted, he would drop quietly into some adjacent hole amid the\r\nwreckage where they could not get at him, and wait there till they\r\nwhirled away after easier prey.\r\n\r\nSo keen was he on adding to his store that, when their commissariat\r\nneeded replenishing, Wulfrey found it necessary to accompany him and to\r\ninsist on his attending strictly to this more important business, or at\r\ntimes they would have gone short.  For the rest, Wulfrey left him to\r\nthe satisfaction of his cravings and interfered with him not at all.\r\n\r\nOne memorable morning, which broke sweet and clear after two days of\r\nstress and storm, the mate set off as usual to find what the gods had\r\nsent him; and Wulf, leaning over the side, watched him paddle across to\r\nthe spit, and land there, and stride away towards the western point\r\nfrom which they always waded out to the wreckage.\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion, before he disappeared in the distance, he stopped\r\nand stood looking out over the sea, and the next moment Wulfrey saw him\r\nwading out towards something which only caught his eye when thus\r\ndirected to it,--something which bobbed up and down among the waves\r\nwith a glint of white at times.\r\n\r\nHe saw Macro reach it and lift his arms in a gesture of amazement.\r\nThen he bent over it and presently came staggering back up the shore\r\nbearing a white burden over his shoulder.  It looked at that distance\r\nso very like a body that Wulfrey tumbled over on to his raft, and\r\npaddled across to the spit, and ran along the shore to where the mate\r\nwas kneeling now alongside his find.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of a woman, pallid and sodden, with her long dark hair\r\nall astream, her white face pinched and shrunken and blue-veined, with\r\ndark hollows round the closed eyes, and colourless lips slightly\r\nretracted showing even, white teeth.  She was clothed only in a long\r\nwhite nightdress, which the water had so moulded to her shapely figure\r\nthat it looked like a piece of fair white marble sculpture.  In life\r\nshe must have been beautiful, Wulfrey thought, as he stood panting, and\r\ngazed down upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" he jerked.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure!  She were lashed to yonder spar and I couldna leave her\r\nthere....  The pity of it!  She's been a fine bit.\"\r\n\r\nWulfrey knelt down, and slipped his hand to the quiet heart,\r\ninstinctively but without hope, bent closer, gently raised one of the\r\nclosed eyelids, and said hastily, \"There may be a chance.  Help me back\r\nhome with her!  Quick!  You take her feet....\" and he taking her under\r\nthe arms they hurried back along the spit.\r\n\r\n\"She is not dead from drowning anyway,\" he jerked as they went.  \"The\r\nexposure may have killed her....  She must have suffered dreadfully.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task to get her on board, but they managed it somehow,\r\nand laid her gently among the blankets in Wulfrey's bunk.\r\n\r\n\"Now....  Bags of hot sand, as quick as you can and as many....  Then\r\nmix some hot rum and water--not too strong,\"--and Macro found himself\r\nspringing to his orders with an alacrity which would have surprised him\r\nif he had had time to think about it.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, his professional instincts at highest pressure, drew off the\r\nclinging garment, muffled the sea-bitten white body in the blankets,\r\nand through them set to gentle vigorous rubbing, to start the chilled\r\nblood flowing again.\r\n\r\nMacro came hurrying in with hot sand from the hearth, wrapped in linen\r\nand tied with strands of untwisted rope.\r\n\r\n\"Good! ... As many more as you can,\" said the Doctor, and placed them\r\nagainst the cold, blue-white feet, and rubbed away for dear life.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he packed her all round with hot sand-bags, Macro heating\r\nthem as fast as they cooled, in a frying-pan over the fire.  He placed\r\nthem under her arms and between her shoulders, and never ceased his\r\nvigorous friction except to renew the bags.\r\n\r\nEach time the mate came in, his face asked news, and each time Wulfrey\r\nshook his head and said, \"Not yet,\" and went on with his rubbing.  His\r\nown blood was at fever-heat with his exertions in that confined space.\r\nBut that was all the better.  His superfluous warmth might transmit\r\nitself in time to the chill white body of his patient.\r\n\r\nMacro came in with hot rum and water, and Wulfrey poured a few careful\r\ndrops between the still-livid lips, watched the result anxiously, and\r\nfollowed them up with more, and then resumed his patient rubbing.\r\n\r\nFor over an hour they worked incessantly, and then Macro was for giving\r\nit up as hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"'S no good.  She's gone, sure,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so....  Too soon to give up anyway,\" and the Doctor\r\nworked on tirelessly.  \"If she should come round----\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"--She'll be starving.  You might break up some hard-tack very small\r\nand warm it up in some weak rum and water,\" and he went on with his\r\nrubbing.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, when he had almost given up hope himself, he had his\r\nreward.  The mate, poking in a head deprecatory of further waste of\r\ntime and energy on so hopeless a job, stood staring amazedly.  For the\r\npinched dead look of the pitiful white face had given place to a faint\r\npresage of life, like the first flutter of dawn on the pallid darkness\r\nof the night.  Death had visibly relaxed his chill grip.  There was a\r\ntinge of colour in the parted lips, and the white teeth inside had come\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"She lives,\" said Wulfrey softly.  \"Her heart is at work again.  Warm\r\nup that rum and water,\" and when it came he administered it cautiously\r\nin drops again, and this time they were visibly swallowed.\r\n\r\n\"Have the warm mash ready,\" he said; and even as he spoke the\r\nblue-veined lids fluttered, but so feebly as hardly to lift the long\r\ndark lashes from the white cheeks.  And through that narrowed window\r\nthe recovered soul looked mistily out on life once more.\r\n\r\nHe gave her still a little more hot rum and water, and when the warm\r\nmashed biscuit came fed her slowly with that, and she swallowed it\r\nhungrily if unconsciously.\r\n\r\nThen, well satisfied with his work, he piled more blankets on her and\r\nleft her to herself.\r\n\r\nHe had had many a fight with death, but none closer than this.  The\r\nsnatching of a life from the cold hand that was closing on it was\r\nalways a cause for rejoicing with him.  And this life, by reason of its\r\ncomely tenement, had appealed to him in quite an unusual way.\r\n\r\nWho she was, and what manner of woman, was still to be learned.  For\r\nthe moment it was enough that she had been within an ace of death and\r\nwas alive again, and that she was unusually good to look upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nWhen the Doctor had had a plunge overboard to restore the vitality he\r\nhad expended on his patient, they sat down to eat, and the mate was\r\ninclined to enlarge somewhat exuberantly on the morning's work,--upon\r\nhis own share in it especially.\r\n\r\n\"A wonderful fine piece of goods for any man to drag out of the water.\r\nI'm doubting if you'd have seen her if you'd bin there, Doctor.  Just\r\nhappened to lift my eye that way, and the white of her caught it, and\r\nin I went.  Not that I thought she could be living, you understand.\r\nShe felt like Death itself when I carried her ashore in my arms----\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll be distressed for lack of clothes when she's ready to get up.\r\nBut that won't be to-day anyway.  Do you think you can light on any out\r\nyonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lit on some last time I was there, but left 'em 'cause they were no\r\nuse to us.  That lot'll mebbe be gone, but there's plenty more for the\r\nfinding.  I'll see to it to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will be grateful to you, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"She should, for if it hadn't bin for me she'd be tumbling about on yon\r\nspar still, and dead by this time, I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"She couldn't have stood much more, that's certain.  I was near losing\r\nhope myself at times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't have believed she'd ever come back if I hadn't seen it.  It's\r\nbeing a doctor made ye keep on so.\"\r\n\r\n\"One feels bound to keep on while there's a possible chance left.  In\r\nthis case one couldn't but feel that there was a chance, if only a\r\nsmall one.  We've done a good day's work to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said the mate, and presently, \"I'm thinking I'll go out there\r\ntoday to get her some clothes.  They'll need a lot of drying, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you do it before dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it.  Ye'll see to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see to her all right.  A little more food and then the longer she\r\nsleeps the better.  If she'd lie where she is for a couple of days it\r\nwould be all to the good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go,\" but he came back to bend down into the little\r\ncompanion-way and say, \"If she's asking, ye'll tell her it was me\r\npulled her out the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell her.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, presently, Wulfrey went to see how she was going on, he found her\r\nsleeping quietly the sleep of utter exhaustion, and as he stood looking\r\nat her it seemed to him that she grew more beautiful each time he saw\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe long wet tresses, whose clamminess he had carefully disposed behind\r\nthe rolled-up blankets which served as a pillow, were drying to a deep\r\nwarm brown.  As they carried her in he had thought her hair was black.\r\nIt was very thick and long.  The texture of her skin, now that the\r\ncoursing blood had obliterated to some extent the pinch and the bite of\r\nthe sea, was fine and delicate, he could see, though suffering still\r\nfrom the salt.\r\n\r\nThe pink fingers of one hand had pulled down the blankets round her\r\nneck as though she had craved more air, and the soft white neck was\r\nsmooth and white as marble.  The one ear turned towards him was like a\r\ndelicate little pink shell.\r\n\r\nAll these things he noted before his gaze settled on the quiet sleeping\r\nface, and lingered there with a strange new sense of joyous discovery\r\nand unexpected increase, as one might feel who suddenly unearths a\r\nhidden treasure.\r\n\r\nHe wondered again who she was and whence she came.  Of gentle birth, he\r\nwas sure.  It showed in every feature of the placid face,--in the\r\nstrong sweet curves of a not too small mouth,--in the delicately-turned\r\nnostrils,--in the soft level brows,--in the long fringing lashes which,\r\nwith the shadows left by her sharp encounter with Death, cast about her\r\nclosed eyes a misty enchantment full of witchery and allurement.  He\r\nwondered what colour her eyes would be when they opened.\r\n\r\nA wide white forehead, somewhat high cheek-bones, and a round\r\nwell-moulded chin, added a fine dignity to the sleeping face.  He stood\r\nso long gazing at its all-unconscious fascination that he feared at\r\nlast lest the very earnestness of his look might disturb her.\r\n\r\nSo he picked up her only earthly possession, and leaving her, sleeping\r\nsoundly, in sole charge of the ship, paddled across to the nearer\r\nshore, washed the salt out of her dainty single garment in a\r\nfresh-water pool, and spread it in the sun to dry, and then went after\r\nrabbits for her benefit when she should waken ravenous.\r\n\r\nReturned on board, after a glance at his still-sleeping patient,--who\r\nlay so motionless that, but for the slight, slow rise and fall of the\r\nblankets over her bosom, one might have deemed her dead,--he set to the\r\nmaking of as tempting a soup as rabbit and rice could furnish, and\r\nregretted, more sorely than ever before, his lack of salt and seasoning.\r\n\r\nThen he sat waiting for her to awake and for Macro to come home.  If\r\nshe did not wake of her own accord before sunset he decided to wake her\r\nhimself.  Sleep was without doubt the best of all restoratives, but\r\nNature craves sustenance, and she was almost certainly starving.  She\r\nwould recover strength more quickly still if her system had something\r\nto draw upon.\r\n\r\nThen, too, they had no light but that of the fire.  If she woke up in\r\nthe dark she would be sorely exercised in her mind to know where she\r\nhad got to.  It would be better to satisfy her, mentally and bodily,\r\nwhile still there was daylight to see by.\r\n\r\nSo, when the sun shone level through the western portholes, he went\r\nsoftly to where she lay, still sleeping soundly, and after watching her\r\nagain for a moment, he placed his hand gently on her forehead.\r\n\r\nShe frowned at the touch and moved uneasily among her blankets.  Then\r\nthe heavy eyes opened and she lay staring wonderingly up at him,\r\nevidently trying to piece past and present together, and to make out\r\nwhere she was.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I? ... Who are you?\" she jerked, in a voice that would have\r\nbeen rich and full if it had not been a little hoarse and husky.  And\r\nthe pink fingers grasped the blanket and drew it up under the rounded\r\nwhite chin.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite safe on a ship.  I am a doctor.  I want you to eat some\r\nwarm soup and then you shall sleep again as long as you can.  Here is\r\nyour night-rail, washed and dried; perhaps you would like to put it on.\r\nI will go and fetch the soup.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he came back presently she was visibly more at ease with her\r\nfrills about her neck.  She raised herself on her left elbow, and he\r\nplaced the tin pannikin of soup in front of her, together with some\r\nbroken biscuit.\r\n\r\n\"Can you feed yourself?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--if I had a spoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to say we have no spoons.\"\r\n\r\n\"No spoons?\" and she stared at him in vast surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you can make shift to drink it out of the pannikin.  You\r\nsee----\"\r\n\r\n\"What a very odd ship--to have no spoons!\" she took a sip of the soup\r\nand screwed up her lips.  \"Would you get me some salt, if you please?\r\nThis soup----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, but we have no salt either.  You see----\"\r\n\r\n\"No salt?\" and she shot another quick amazed look at him.  \"Mon Dieu,\r\nmon Dieu!\" at which Wulfrey pricked up his ears.  \"Whatever kind of a\r\nship--you did say a ship, did you not?  Where is it going to?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not going anywhere.  You see, it's practically a stranded ship\r\nthough it's really afloat----\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her forehead and rubbed it gently, and then clasped\r\nit tightly, with her thumb at one temple and her fingers at the other.\r\n\"I think my head is swimming yet,\" she said simply.  \"I cannot follow\r\nwhat you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll understand as soon as you get on deck.  This ship is bottled up\r\ninside a lake on an island.  It has been here for probably thirty or\r\nforty years----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you--have you been here all that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we were wrecked as you were, I suppose, on the banks out there.\r\nWe managed to get ashore and found this ship to live on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are 'we'?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mate of the ship and myself.  We were the only ones saved.  It was\r\nhe saw you in the water and went in after you and brought you ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was good of him.  I will thank him.  Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's out at the wreckage trying to find you some clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a good man....  How long have you been here?\"\r\n\r\n\"About three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no one has come to you in all that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the first.  Now\"--as she finished the soup--\"take a good drink\r\nof this,\"--some weak rum and water warmed up in another pannikin, over\r\nwhich she choked and coughed and wrinkled up her pretty nose\r\ndistastefully.  \"Then you will go to sleep again, and in the morning I\r\nhope you will be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is so much I would like to know----\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have had another long sleep.  Are you quite warm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.  That horrid stuff was like fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were cold enough when we found you.  In fact we believed you were\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nShe shivered and nestled down among the blankets with a wave of colour\r\nin her face.\r\n\r\n\"I will sleep,\" she said quietly, and the Doctor left her to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark before the mate pitched his cargo up on to the deck\r\nand came groping up the side after it.\r\n\r\n\"What luck?\" asked Wulfrey, as he came up to help him.\r\n\r\n\"Brought all I could lay hands on, but I wouldn't like to say they're\r\nright kind of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll be glad of them whatever they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she come round?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wakened her to take some soup and biscuit.  Now I hope she will\r\nsleep till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told her it was me brought her ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I told her that.  She will thank you herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find out who she is and where she hails from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.  There'll be time enough to learn all that.  My only desire\r\nwas to get some nourishment inside her.  She'll be building up now all\r\nthe time she's sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' she's a good-looking bit of goods, eh?\" asked the mate, as they\r\nsat eating.\r\n\r\n\"Very good-looking, I should say, and pulling round quickly.  A\r\ngentlewoman without doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can ye tell that now?  There's many a good-looking hussy\r\nthat's not gentle-born.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Wulfrey, looking across the fire at him.  \"But this\r\nisn't one of that kind.  She's a lady to the finger-tips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--too fine a lady to live on a ship with the likes o' you and me,\r\nmebbe,\" growled the mate.  \"All same, if't 'adn't bin for me her\r\nleddyship ud be no more'n a little white corp tumbling about out yonder\r\nin its little white shift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Wulfrey, on whom this insistence on his sole claim to\r\nthe salvaging of her was beginning to pall.  \"And if it hadn't been for\r\nme your bringing her ashore wouldn't have been of much service to her.\r\nSo suppose we say no more about it.  We'll divide the honours.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't brought her ashore ye couldn't have brought her round,\"\r\ngrowled the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Six of one and half a dozen of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"No six of anything.  Ye can't deny I brought her ashore.\"\r\n\r\nWulfrey lit his pipe and went up on deck, wondering what was working in\r\nthe curious fellow's brain now.\r\n\r\nWhen he went down again he found that Macro had opened his bundles and\r\nspread their contents out to dry, and had turned in.  He just glanced\r\nat the varied assortment, and then, not to disturb his patient by going\r\nanywhere near her, spread some blankets in the room next to the mate's,\r\nand turned in himself.  But he lay awake for a long time, wondering if\r\nthe introduction of this new element into the limited circle of their\r\nlives was like to make for peace or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nWulfrey was up early, after a restless night, anxious to see how his\r\npatient fared.  It was such a morning as usually followed their\r\nstorms--clear and bright and sunny, with a pale-blue wind-swept sky,\r\nand a crisp breeze that tipped the green of the waves outside with\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe first time he went softly in she was still sleeping, and with much\r\nsatisfaction he noted the improvement the food and rest had wrought in\r\nher.  Her face had filled out, the cheek-bones were less prominent, the\r\ndark circles round her eyes were not nearly so pronounced as before,\r\nthough he imagined the long dark lashes and level brows would always\r\nlend a sense of depth and witchery to the great dark eyes themselves.\r\nThe slight salting and roughening of the skin would speedily cure\r\nitself under the application of fresh water.  She was almost herself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTheir fire, on its bed of sand, was never allowed to go out.  The\r\nsupply of wood was unlimited and always, in the depths of the heap of\r\nwhite ashes, was a golden core of heat only waiting to be fed.  So he\r\nset to and prepared coffee for her, and some flour-and-water biscuits,\r\nand when he went in again she was awake.  She turned her head and\r\nlooked at him, and his heart beat quicker than was its wont.\r\n\r\nHer eyes, he perceived, were very dark blue, almost black, and looked\r\nthe darker for the dark fringing lashes.  They were very beautiful\r\neyes, he decided, and very eloquent,--there was something of\r\napprehension in them when first they met his, but it vanished when he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"You are better, I can see.  You slept well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only just wakened.  You are the doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am the doctor.  I have got some coffee for you and some\r\nbiscuits.  I will get them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" as he came in with them and she raised herself on\r\nto her elbow again.  \"Did your friend get me any clothes?  I feel quite\r\nwell, and I would get up.\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought a whole heap of things.  They have been spread out all\r\nnight, but I'm afraid they'll never dry properly till they are washed\r\nin fresh water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you fresh water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, plenty,--Ashore there, in pools.  If you can select a few things I\r\nwill go across and steep them.  They will soon dry in the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" she said again, and sipped the coffee and glanced\r\nup at him with a somewhat wry face.  \"No, you have no sugar on this\r\nstrange ship--nor milk.  Nor a brush, nor a comb, I'll be bound.\r\nNothing but----\"\r\n\r\n\"A brush and a comb we can provide at all events, and of exceptional\r\nquality.  They belonged, I believe, to His Royal Highness the Duke of\r\nKent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward of Kent?\" she asked quickly.  \"Why--how....\"\r\n\r\n\"Some ship, bringing home his belongings from Canada, must have been\r\nwrecked here.  We have found quite a number of his things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he would not mind my using them,\" she said quietly.  \"He is of a\r\npleasant temper, quite the nicest of them all\"; and as she finished the\r\ncoffee and biscuits, \"If you could find me ... a brooch--no, you will\r\nnot have a brooch! ... a large pin or two,--but no, you will not have\r\nany pins! ... Let me see, then,--a sharp splinter of wood----\"\r\n\r\n\"I can get you all the splinters you want.  Might I ask----\"\r\n\r\n\"To pin some of these blankets about me, do you see,--so that I may get\r\nup.  And if you would get me that royal brush and comb----\"\r\n\r\nHe trimmed up half a dozen sharp little skewers and left them with her,\r\ntogether with the brush and comb, and plunged overboard for his morning\r\nswim.\r\n\r\nThe mate was sitting by the fire at his breakfast when he went down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Well?--how is my lady this morning?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"So well that she is getting up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Them clothes all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will pick out what she wants.  But they'll never dry with the salt\r\nin them.  I'll rinse them in one of the pools as soon as she says\r\nwhich.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's more mebbe for the finding----\" and then they heard the door\r\nof her little room open and she came into the cabin to them.\r\n\r\nThe mate jumped up and stood staring as if she were a ghost; and even\r\nWulfrey, who had already made her acquaintance, eyed her with surprise,\r\nand was confirmed in the idea that had been growing in him that there\r\nwas foreign blood in her.  He doubted if any Englishwoman could have\r\nmade so brave a showing out of such poverty of material.\r\n\r\nFastened simply with her wooden skewers, she had one blanket draped\r\nabout her as a skirt, and another covered her shoulders, with a high\r\npeak behind her neck, like a monkish cloak.  And inside this rough\r\ncalyx the fair white column of her neck rose out of its surrounding\r\nfrillery like the stamen of a flower from its nest of petals.  Her\r\nabundant hair, combed and brushed, but still lacking somewhat of its\r\nnatural lustre, was coiled about her head in heavy plaits.\r\n\r\nThough her garments were only rough blankets they were so disposed\r\nabout her person that she stood before them tall and slim and graceful.\r\nHer eyes and face were all aglow at the novelty of her situation.  Her\r\nfeet were bare.\r\n\r\nShe sailed up to the mate with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"It was you who brought me ashore out of that terrible sea,\" she said,\r\nand her voice was no longer hoarse and husky.  \"I thank you with all my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nMacro ducked his head but never took his eyes off her.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!  Ye looked very different then, miss,\" he jerked.  \"We scarce\r\nexpected ye'd ever come round like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the more grateful.  But--what a wonderful room you have!\"--as she\r\nlooked round at the mate's barbaric hangings.  \"Silks and satins!--and\r\nsuch gorgeous colours!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's bales of them about, miss, and you're very welcome to them.\r\nThey'd look better on you than them blankets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the blankets are warm, and the dreadful chill of the sea is still\r\nin my thoughts all the time.  Now I would go on deck and understand\r\nabout this strange ship of yours,\" and Macro hastened to lead the way\r\nand Wulfrey followed.\r\n\r\n\"But it is truly amazing,\" she said, as she gazed round at the\r\nsandhills and the spit, at the tumbling waves beyond, and the unruffled\r\nwaters of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"And another ship!  Who lives there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one.  There is not another soul on the whole island but we three,\"\r\nsaid Wulfrey.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds dreadfully lonely.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not so lonely as the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not so lonely as the sea.  The sea is dreadful, and oh,\r\nso-o-o cold when you are dying in it slowly, an inch at a time,\" and\r\nshe shivered again at the recollection.\r\n\r\n\"You must try to forget all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forget it.  That is not possible.  The memory of it is\r\nfrozen into my soul.  What noise is that?\" she asked, listening\r\nintently with her hand uplifted.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great cloud of sea-birds that haunts the island.  All the\r\nwrecks come ashore at that end, and they live there most of the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like the wailing of lost souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, miss!\" broke in Macro.  \"That's what it is.  They're only\r\nbirds, mebbe, but there's the souls of the dead inside 'em, an'\r\nsometimes they're fair deevils when they come screaming round in a\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could believe that,--the souls of the dead without a doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we turn to something pleasanter,\" suggested Wulfrey.  \"Perhaps\r\nyou will choose out the things you think most suitable from all that\r\nthe mate brought over from the wrecks?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the wrecks?\" ... and she glanced at him doubtfully with a little\r\nshiver.  \"It does not sound too nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will bring them up.  You will see them better here,\" and they\r\nspread the deck with Macro's latest importations.\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!\" murmured she, as she turned them over with\r\ncurious fingers, and held them up to adjudge their style and make.\r\n\"But they are things of the days before the flood! ... They are too\r\namazing! ... They are wonderful beyond words!\"\r\n\r\n\"Could ye no alter them to your needs, mebbe?\" suggested Macro\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps--with needle and thread and scissors.  But have you these?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe I can find 'em for ye.  There's the cargoes of hunderds o' ships\r\nout there.  Ye can find a'most anything if ye look long enough.  And\r\nmebbe there's newer things if I can light on 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"And some shoes and stockings, think you?  I would be very glad of\r\nthem.  It feels strange to go with bare feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll find 'em if there's any there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very good of you.  I thank you.  Could I perhaps come too?\"\r\n\r\nThe idea evidently appealed strongly to him.  He looked at her eagerly,\r\nand hesitated, but finally said, \"It's no easy getting there.  There's\r\nover six miles' walk through the sand, then near a mile of wading up to\r\nyour neck in the water, and sometimes a bit of a swim, all according to\r\nthe tide.  Some day, mebbe, I'll mek a bit raft to tek ye across from\r\nthe point there--just to see what it's like.  But ye want these things\r\nand I'll get along quicker alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you all the same.  It will be for some other time then,\" and\r\nMacro let himself down on to his raft and paddled away to the spit.\r\nShe stood watching him till he landed and set off at speed towards the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\"He is truly good-hearted,\" she said, as he disappeared.  \"He is not\r\nall English?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is from the islands off the west coast of Scotland, but he\r\nconfesses to a strain of Spanish blood also.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why confesses?  It is not, I suppose, his own doing.  One\r\nconfesses to a fault.  Is a strain of foreign blood a sin in your eyes\r\nthen, Monsieur le Docteur?\" she asked, with pointed emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"By no means.  I should have said he rejoices in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We English--British, I should say,\"--with a fleeting gleam of a\r\nsmile--\"are too apt to look upon all foreigners as of lower breed than\r\nourselves, which is quite a mistake and leads to much misunderstanding.\r\nEvery nation has distinctive qualities of its own, is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly.  And unless one knows them by personal experience one\r\nshould not pass judgment.  I must confess to being nothing of a\r\ntraveller.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came you here?\" she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"I was bound for America--or Canada, with the intention of settling out\r\nthere.  It looks now, according to the mate, as though this strip of\r\nsand has got to suffice us for the rest of our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" ... with a startled look.  \"Is there no getting away then?\r\nDoes no one ever come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"None but dead men, if they can help it, apparently.  You were an\r\nexception to the rule.  So were we.  We have none of us any right to be\r\nhere alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had some shoes and stockings, and some proper clothes, I believe\r\nI could be quite happy here,\" she said.  \"That is if one has not also\r\nto starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to starve.  The island is over-run with rabbits.\r\nThere are fish in the lake here if only we could catch them, and out\r\nthere among the wreckage are all kinds of things--casks of pork and\r\nbeef, and coffee, and rum, and flour--enough to last us for hundreds of\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a most excellent retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"If one were sick of the world.  But you surely are too young to have\r\narrived at that stage.\"\r\n\r\n\"One may be young and yet be sick of one's world....  Sometime I will\r\ntell you....  Now, if you please, I will take a few of these things and\r\nyou will show me your pool and I will wash them----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll do all that for you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  Besides, with your permission and if you will leave me\r\nquite alone, I would like also to wash in fresh water.  I too shall\r\nnever feel quite dry until I have done so.\"\r\n\r\nHe assisted her down to the other raft, through a break they had long\r\nsince made in the side for that purpose, and paddled ashore.  There he\r\nshowed her the pool they had set apart for washing, and told her he\r\nwould come back for her at whatever time she chose.\r\n\r\n\"In two hours, please,\" and he went off into the sand-hills.\r\n\r\nBut his mind stubbornly refused to interest itself in rabbits.  He\r\ndropped down on the sunny side of a hummock and let his thoughts run on\r\nthis most surprising addition to their company.  What could possibly\r\nexplain her,--young, beautiful, of undoubted birth and breeding, yet\r\nready to renounce the world, of which her twenty years or so had\r\napparently given her a surfeit, and to welcome the chance of a hermit\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nIt was a puzzle beyond any man's understanding.  All his thinking led\r\nhim only towards shadowy possibilities.  And these the thought of her\r\nsweet face and clear frank outlook rejected instantly as libels on her\r\nfair fame, which he, with no more knowledge than he now had, yet felt\r\nhimself prepared to defend with all his might against the whole world.\r\nIf that girl was not all that she seemed and that he believed her to\r\nbe, he would never trust his own judgment again.\r\n\r\nAll the same, it was very amazing, and she filled his thoughts to such\r\nan extent that the rabbits hopped fearlessly about him as he sat\r\nthinking of her; and it was long after the two hours before he came to\r\nhimself, and rewarded their temerity by knocking a couple on the head\r\nand striding away back to find her.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting waiting for him, with a fresh-water brightness in her\r\nface, her hair coiled loosely round her head, and her washing still\r\ndrying in the sun.  She hastily bundled up her things at sight of him\r\nand came along to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"I began to fear you had forgotten me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Very much to the contrary.  It was our dinner I came near forgetting,\"\r\nand he dangled the rabbits before her.  \"You feel better for the fresh\r\nwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very much better.  And now I am hungry.  When does your friend\r\ncome back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till evening as a rule.  If he can lay hands on what you want he\r\nmay come sooner to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you--do you never go out there with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sometimes.  But it doesn't attract me as it does him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are differently made, I suppose;--which is perhaps a good thing.\r\nHe delights in finding things out there.  I go out only for\r\nnecessaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he find--besides strange old clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heaps of things--treasure.  There are the cargoes of very many\r\nships out there.  They have been accumulating for hundreds of years, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it does not attract you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the slightest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, perhaps, rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have enough, and I have my profession,--and little chance apparently\r\nof making any use of either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah...\" and presently, \"As to that, am I wrong then in thinking that if\r\nyou had not been here I would most likely not have been here either?\"\r\nand the wind and the sun had whipped a fine colour into her face.\r\n\r\n\"You would, perhaps, not be very far wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember it dimly, and in broken bits, like a horrible dream,--the\r\ncrash, the terrible noise of the waves, the shouting and the screaming.\r\nIt was the Captain himself who tied me to that mast when everything was\r\ngoing to pieces.  And when the waves washed over me, and I felt myself\r\nslowly dying, I would have loosed myself if I could, to make an end.\r\nIt was terrible to be so long of dying.  And the cold of the sea!--oh,\r\nit was a horror,\" and she shivered again at the remembrance...  \"Then I\r\ndied....  And then--long long afterwards--I found myself coming slowly\r\nback to life, and beginning to get warm again, with prickly pains like\r\npins and needles all over me----\"\r\n\r\n\"That was your blood beginning to flow again.\"\r\n\r\n\"----I felt warm hands rubbing me--rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.  They\r\nmust have rubbed for years, and, all the time, I was slowly coming\r\nback.  They were very warm and soothing.  And at last they rubbed me\r\nback to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the name of your ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Ben Lomond,' from Glasgow to New York, and the Captain was John\r\nMacDonald.  It was a large ship and full of passengers.  It is terrible\r\nto think of them all gone but me.--Oh, terrible!--terrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask your name--since we are like to be neighbours for the rest\r\nof our lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Avice Drummond,\" she said, with a quick glance at him.  \"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wulfrey Dale.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the mate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheumaish Macro,--or Hamish, I'm not sure which.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same.  He is a good man?--to be trusted?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no reason to think otherwise, but I have only known him since\r\nwe landed here.  He is chock full of superstition----\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the Highlander in him.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bit hot-blooded too, and apt to boil over.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the Spaniard.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's crazy after the spoil out yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Highlander again.  It is, as you say, perhaps just as well you do\r\nnot care for it, or you might have quarrelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is welcome to it all as far as I am concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of his country.  I can understand how he feels.  It is the old\r\nriever spirit in him finding its opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nHe was vitally conscious of her proximity to him as they paced through\r\nthe soft sand towards the raft.  The sight of her pink toes popping in\r\nand out from under her blanket-skirt quickened his blood.  He knew\r\nwithout looking when she glanced round at him now and again, as when he\r\nhad asked her name.\r\n\r\nHe had not thought that the feeling of a woman's eyes upon him could\r\nstir him to such an extent, no matter how wonderful they might be in\r\ntheir depths of eloquent darkness.  He knew all about\r\nwomen,--physically, organically, professionally, and still held woman\r\nin reverence.  Experience had taught him also that in reality he and\r\nhis fellows knew very little about them beyond merest surface\r\nindications,--that there were in most women, perhaps in all, deeps\r\nbeyond man's sounding, heights beyond his attainment,--a general\r\nelusiveness mysteriously comprehensive of feelings, instincts,\r\npassions, emotions, nerves, moods, humours, vapours, which a wise man\r\naccepted without expecting ever fully to understand.\r\n\r\nThat this shapely girl in her swathed blankets should affect him to\r\nsuch an extent that he was actually conscious of a superb new joy in\r\nliving, of an absolute rejuvenescence, of a vitalising of all his\r\nenergies, was a very great surprise to him.  He could feel the blood\r\nrunning redder in his veins.  His heart beat more briskly than it had\r\ndone since he landed on the island.\r\n\r\nBut after three months of nothing but Macro and rabbits and screaming\r\nbirds, it was not to be wondered at after all, he reasoned to himself.\r\nLife had been running on a low level.  There had been nothing to lift\r\nthem above the mere satisfaction of their bodily necessities.  Eating,\r\nsleeping, getting through the days had sufficed them.\r\n\r\nAnd here, into that rough husk of a life, had suddenly come a soul, to\r\nanimate them both to higher things, even though it were no more than\r\nthe ministering to her more delicate necessities.\r\n\r\nEven Macro was feeling it, and was toiling out yonder, not for himself\r\nbut for her.  Without doubt life was immensely more worth living than\r\nit had been two days ago.\r\n\r\nIt was a joy even to cook for her, though he had always detested the\r\npreparation of food.  To know beforehand what one was going to eat was\r\nsufficient to reduce one's appetite.  To superintend a meal through all\r\nits stages, from raw to ready, put anything beyond the mere filling of\r\nan internal void out of the question.\r\n\r\nBut cooking for himself and cooking for her were matters of very\r\ndifferent complexion, and he found himself considering culinary\r\nenterprises which surprised him greatly.\r\n\r\n\"You will let me help,\" she said, when they had climbed on board, and\r\nshe saw him setting to work on the rabbits.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make biscuit?\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything to make it with,\" so he provided her with flour\r\nand water and a frying-pan, and tackled his own repulsive job, looking\r\nforward to the best-made biscuit they had had since they came ashore.\r\n\r\n\"You have no butter--lard--dripping--fat--nothing?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"There is some fat pork.  We stew it with the rabbit as a rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get me some and I will render it down and we shall have much better\r\ncakes.  Men never know how to cook unless they are trained to it.  You\r\nhave no seasonings of any kind--no?  Nor salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a scrap.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might find something on shore there.  I saw many little plants.  We\r\nwill search next time we go.\"\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, even the repellent cooking took on quite a new aspect and\r\nbecame a joyous pastime in her company, and they presently sat down to\r\nsuch a meal as he had not tasted since he left Liverpool.  Many a more\r\nabundant one he had had, but none with such a flavour to it, and that\r\nwas due entirely to the deft white hands that had helped to prepare it.\r\n\r\nMeals hitherto had been in the nature of necessary nuisances.  He and\r\nthe mate had often sat eating without a word between them, and with\r\nperhaps less enjoyment in it than the rabbits out there among the\r\nsandhills.  But, henceforth, meals would be feasts full of delight\r\nbecause of this stranger girl, whose presence would be salt and savour\r\nand seasoning to the poorest of fare.\r\n\r\n\"And he--the mate,--when does he eat?\" she asked suddenly, after they\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\n\"Not till he gets back,--at night-fall as a rule.  It's a good long\r\nway, you see, and he likes to spend all his time working.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he will find me some shoes,--and some needles and thread.  Then\r\nI shall feel much happier....  And you really think we shall never get\r\naway from here?\" she asked, quite cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"If we could prevail on Macro to think of building a boat, instead of\r\namassing treasure-trove, we might at all events try it.  Nova Scotia is\r\nbut a hundred miles away, he says,----\"\r\n\r\n\"So close?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he seems to think it a risky voyage, and so far we have come\r\nacross no tools with which to build.  You see, they are not things\r\nlikely to come ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I believe I could be quite content to live here,\" she said\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"For ever?--Never to get back to the larger life of the world as long\r\nas you lived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--that! ... I do not know....  It is a very hollow life after all,\r\nthat larger life of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"To grow old here,\" he said thoughtfully, emphasising his points with\r\nslowly nodding head.  \"To be the last one left alive perhaps....  To be\r\nall alone, sick, starving, dying slowly in the dark, unable to lift a\r\nfinger....\"\r\n\r\n\"I would drown myself if it came to that.  It sounds horrible....\r\nPerhaps, after all, we had better build the boat and get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know that we can.  I know nothing about boat-building even\r\nif I had the tools, and Macro won't turn to it till he has raked\r\nthrough the wreckage, and that will take him about a hundred years.  It\r\ngrows with every storm, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the tools?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two difficult jobs, perhaps impossible ones.  You might perhaps\r\nprevail on Macro, but even he can do nothing without tools....  But, if\r\nI may venture to say so--it is surely early days for you to have\r\ndiscovered the hollowness of life, and to feel ready to spend the rest\r\nof it on a sandbank.  Life should hold more in it than that for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked meditatively across at him for a moment, then seemed to make\r\nup her mind.  \"It is natural you should wish to know....  I will tell\r\nyou....  It is a somewhat sorry story, but I think you will\r\nunderstand....  My name told you nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--except that it was a very pretty name.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared it would.  It is natural, I suppose, to imagine that the\r\nwhole world knows of one's misfortunes.  Have you ever heard of the\r\nCountess d'Ormont?\"\r\n\r\n\"The name is familiar to me in some way,\" he said, staring at her in\r\nsurprise at the trend this was taxing.\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot recall----\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Comte d'Artois----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" he nodded.  \"Now I remember----\"\r\n\r\n\"The Countess d'Ormont was Margaret Drummond, my mother.  My father is\r\nCharles Philippe, Comte d'Artois, brother of the poor King, Louis,\r\nwhose head they cut off; and I hate and detest him for his treatment of\r\nher....  She is dead, my poor dear one! ... She believed at first that\r\nshe was properly married to him, and I have no doubt she was--in\r\nLondon.  He is a poor thing, but he was very fond of her, for a\r\ntime....  I was born at Chantilly.  It was before his quarrel with the\r\nDuc de Bourbon, and we lived in Paris and elsewhere according to his\r\ncaprice.  When my mother learned all the truth, and that in Paris she\r\nwas not legally his wife, it broke her heart, I think.  I never\r\nremembered her but as sad and troubled.  Except on my account she was\r\nnot sorry to die, I know.  I was in Paris all through the Red times,\r\nand saw--oh, mon Dieu,--the horrors of it all!--things I could never\r\nforget if I lived to be a thousand....  In London we were all very\r\nbadly off....  But he liked to have me with him, and poor Mme de\r\nPolastron was very good to me, but she was a strange, strange woman....\r\nHer death was a great blow to him ... and a great loss to me.  He was\r\nreally very badly off there, and I did not like the people he had about\r\nhim,--de Vaudreuil, de Roll, du Theil, and the rest, and I made up my\r\nmind to seek my own life elsewhere.  And that is about all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have friends in America--relatives perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother's people, in Virginia.  They have prospered there....  The\r\nnew life out there, where all men are equal, appeals to me.  Now you\r\nunderstand why I would not have cared very much if Mr Macro had not\r\nbrought me ashore and if you had not rubbed me back to life.  I seem to\r\nhave no place in the world.  I hate the aristocrats for what my mother\r\nsuffered at their hands, and I hate the others for the terrible scenes\r\nI passed through as a child.  These things are stamped into my heart\r\nand brain for ever.  And that is why this lonely island, far away from\r\nit all, seems better to me than any place I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would grow tired of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could never grow as sick of it as I did of what I have left.  It is\r\nnot perhaps a very full life, but neither is it hollow and heartless.\r\nYou I can trust, and Mr Macro also.  It is lonely, but it is sweet and\r\npeaceful----\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you see it in a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Storms are nothing when you have seen Paris drunk with blood.\r\nAch!--the horror of it!\" and she flung out her hands in a gesture\r\nfull-charged with terrible memories, and then pressed them over her\r\neyes as though to blot it all out.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will do all in our power to make things comfortable for you,\r\nfor as long as we have to stop here....  For your sake I hope it will\r\nnot be long.  Life should hold more for you than this,\" said Wulfrey,\r\nand mused much on the beautiful stranger and her strange history, and\r\nwondered what the future held for them all.\r\n\r\nThe mate came back when it was growing dark, very tired and in none too\r\ngood a humour at the poverty of his finds.  The results of a hard day's\r\nwork, so far as he disclosed them, were a number of rusty sail-maker's\r\nneedles which he had found in a chest, and half a dozen pairs of shoes,\r\nsodden almost out of semblance to leather.\r\n\r\nMiss Drummond, however, was delighted and thanked him heartily.\r\n\r\n\"You will lend me a knife, and out of some of your beautiful silks I\r\nwill make a new dress.  I shall like that better than wearing any of\r\nthose ancient ones which belonged to the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're very welcome, miss.  I broke into more'n a score of chests and\r\nboxes and not a blessed stocking among the lot.  And them shoes are\r\npretty bad, but they were best I could find.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will rub them with fat and they will return all right, and the\r\nneedles will come bright with sand.  I shall do very well now.  Thread\r\nI can get from a piece of your linen.  I thank you very much.  Now you\r\nwill eat some of my cakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best cakes ever I tasted,\" he said with a full mouth.  \"Takes a woman\r\nto cook properly.  And best day's work I done since I got here, fishing\r\nyou out the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps--I am not yet sure, but I thank you all the same.  When will\r\nyou begin to build a boat for us to get away in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ... Building a boat needs tools.  What for do you want to get away\r\nso quick?  You're but just got here.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present I am content.  But--for always?  I am not sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, there, is always wanting to get away.  But he knows we can't\r\nbuild a boat without tools.  An' I put it to him--has he so much as set\r\neyes on a tool out yonder since we come ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say I have, but then I haven't seen as much of the wreckage as\r\nyou have.  There may be any amount of----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ay, there mebbe!  But so far we haven't struck 'em, an' it's no\r\ngood talking o' boats till we got the tools.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will look for them,\" said The Girl confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ay, ye can look for 'em, and mebbe sometime a boat'll come ashore\r\nready-made, or one that we can make shift to patch up.  Meantime we've\r\ngot all we want here and there's plenty more for the getting out\r\nyonder.  So be content, say I, miss, for by rights the Doctor and me\r\nought to be two clean-picked white skeletons out there on the pile, an'\r\nyou ought to be a little white corp tumbling about on yon spar for the\r\nbirds to peck at.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there skeletons out there?\" she asked with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Heaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I will not go.  I have seen so much of Death.  I would forget\r\nit for a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll meet him sure if ye try to get across from here in any boat we\r\ncould build,\" growled the mate, and filled his pipe and his pannikin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nNext morning Macro went off as usual to the wreck-pile, and Miss\r\nDrummond set to work on her dressmaking.  Wulfrey hoisted up out of the\r\nhold for her such pieces of silk and linen as she required, and scoured\r\na couple of the smallest needles with sand till they were usable.\r\nThen, with the sharpest knife he could find among their stock, he cut\r\nout on the deck, under her direction, various lengths and designs which\r\nto him were meaningless, but replete with possibilities from her point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nBut when, presently, she saw him preparing to go ashore for water and\r\nrabbits, she threw down her needle and said, \"I will go also.  You will\r\nnot mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I shall mind very much.  I shall feel honoured by\r\nyour company.  It is a pleasure to have someone to talk to again,\" and\r\nhe helped her down on to the raft, and thought how much less\r\ninteresting shoes were than little naked feet.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not then talk much with Mr Macro?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, and sometimes we hardly spoke all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You quarrelled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that, but ... well, we had not very much in common, you see.\r\nHis mind was always full of his discoveries out there, and one got\r\nrather tired of it at times.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I shall like him as much as I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why that?  I'm sorry if I have said anything that seems to reflect on\r\nhim in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am used to judging for myself.  It is a look that comes into his\r\neyes at times,--like a horse when it is going to bite.  No,\"--with a\r\ndecided little nod,--\"I shall not like him as much as I hoped; and I am\r\nsorry, for I ought to feel grateful to him for pulling me out of the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you are feeling grateful for being alive, anyway,\" he said,\r\nwith a smile.  \"That is better than being doubtful about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to be alive than dead.  And if we have to live here all\r\nour lives--very well, we must put up with it.  And if you and he die,\r\nand I am left all alone, and get old and sick, as you said yesterday, I\r\nwill make an end of myself.  I was thinking about it all night except\r\nwhen I was sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to have troubled you so.  We will hope for better things.\r\nAnyway I have no intention of dying for some time to come, if I can\r\nhelp it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not,\" she said, with sudden deep earnestness.  \"I count it\r\nGod's good mercy that you are here, for I can trust you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am used to being trusted,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I know.  I can see it....  If I had been all alone ... with nobody but\r\nhim ... But, no!  I could not...\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that there is any harm in him.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat nodding her pretty head meaningly....  \"You have not seen men\r\nloosed from all restraints as I have.  I was but a child and did not\r\nfully understand.  But I see their faces and their eyes still, fierce\r\nand wild and hungry for other than bread.  When men are answerable to\r\nnone but themselves they become wild beasts and devils.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a hard saying.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is true.  I have seen it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And women?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are as bad, but in a different way.  Oh, they are terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you and I and Macro here?  To whom are we answerable?\" he asked,\r\nto sound her to the depths.\r\n\r\n\"He is answerable to you,\" she said quickly.  \"You and I are answerable\r\nto one another, and to God, and to ourselves--to all that has made us\r\nwhat we are.  I do not think you could trespass outside all that, any\r\nmore than I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I could.  I am honoured by your confidence in me.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped her ashore, and they filled the buckets at the pools, and\r\nthen she expressed a wish to see something more of this sandbank where\r\nthey might have to pass the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nSo they threaded their way among the hummocks to the northern shore,\r\nand, at the first green valley they came to, she went down on her knees\r\nand examined carefully the nestling growths on which the rabbits fed,\r\nand found among them certain pungent little plants which she thought\r\nmight serve for flavouring, and they gathered enough to experiment with.\r\n\r\nThe firm smooth tidal beach, with the ripples creaming up it in\r\nsibilant whispers tempted her to bare feet, and she handed him her\r\nshoes and splashed along as joyously as a child.\r\n\r\n\"It is a most delightful island,\" she said.  \"I do not think I would\r\never tire of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you would.  It is all just the same, you see.  You can walk\r\non and on like this and round the other side for forty or fifty miles,\r\nand every bit of it is just like the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It gets monotonous in time.  The only diversion is the pile of\r\nwreckage down yonder.  That is constantly changing and growing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And discovering more skeletons!  It feels odd to think that I should\r\nhave been one myself if you two had not happened to be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it feels very much nicer to be comfortably clothed with\r\nflesh,\" and glancing at her supple grace and entrancing bare feet and\r\nankles, he found himself profoundly grateful for the facts of the case.\r\nThe thought of her as a skeleton was eminently distasteful to him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is better.  Dead bodies and bones have always had a horror for\r\nme; but not the simple fact of being dead, I think....  I do not think\r\nI would be afraid to die--if it were not very painful.  But ... well,\r\nthe thought of my dead body is horrid to me.  I would not like to see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not likely to be troubled to that extent anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, one is at all events spared that.  But why do you talk of such\r\nunpleasant things when the sun is shining and the waves are sparkling?\r\nTell me about yourself.  All you have told me so far is that you are a\r\ndoctor, and that your name is Wulfrey Dale.  I never heard the name\r\nWulfrey before.  And that you were going out to Canada when you were\r\nwrecked here.  Why were you going out?\"\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to be as frank with her as she had been with him.\r\nBut that was impossible.  Another woman's good name was too intricately\r\ninterwoven with his story, and the whole matter was so open to\r\nmisjudgment.  If he tried to explain he must either label that other\r\nwoman as murderess or himself as an incapable doctor, and he chose to\r\ndo neither.  He wished she had not asked, but found it only natural\r\nthat she should desire to know all about him.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing much to tell,\" he said.  \"I come from Hazelford, in\r\nCheshire.  My father had the practice there and when he died I\r\nsucceeded to it.  But the wander-spirit seized me.  I wanted a larger\r\nsphere.  The new world called, and I came,--as it turns out to a still\r\nsmaller place----\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are not going to stop here all our lives.  We must build that\r\nboat and get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will live in hope, anyway, but for that we are dependent on Macro,\r\nand he's not an easy man to drive.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will see,\" she said confidently.  \"How do you catch your rabbits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one of these little valleys is full of them.  As soon as you\r\nappear they all bolt for their holes and in the panic they tumble over\r\none another and you pick them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am always sorry to kill things, and they are so pretty,\" she said,\r\nas they crept cautiously up the side of the nearest hummock.  \"But they\r\nare very good and I suppose one must eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or starve.  Now--see!\" and he jumped down into the hollow, which\r\nscurried into life under his feet, and came back in a moment with a\r\ncouple of rabbits which he had already knocked on the head.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little things!\" she said, stroking the soft fur.\r\n\r\n\"They were dead before they knew it....  Our lake ends there,\" he said,\r\npointing it out to her from where they stood on top of the hummock.\r\n\"But the island goes on and on, all just the same as this as far as you\r\ncan see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks very lonely ... but I like it,\" and she sat long, with her\r\nhands clasped round her knees, gazing out over the wandering yellow\r\nline of sandhills, and the slow-heaving seas which broke in\r\nwhite-fringed ripples along the beach.\r\n\r\n\"And you left no ties behind you there in England?\" she asked suddenly,\r\nshowing where her thoughts had been.\r\n\r\n\"No ties whatever.  Friends in plenty, but nothing more.  When my\r\nfather died I was quite alone in the world.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded fellow-feelingly, and they sauntered back in a somewhat\r\ncloser intimacy of understanding and liking for one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nMacro had had a good day out there, and returned in the best of humours\r\nwith himself and as hungry as usual.\r\n\r\nAs he ate he enlarged on his finds, and when he had finished his supper\r\nhe piled the fire with light sticks to make a blaze, and spread them\r\nout for Miss Drummond's inspection.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently lighted on the personal baggage of some person of\r\nquality.  There were rings and brooches and pins and bracelets, of gold\r\nand silver, set with coloured stones, a couple of small watches\r\nbeautifully chased and studded with gems, a small silver-mounted mirror\r\nall blackened with sea-water, two gold snuff-boxes with enamelled\r\nminiatures on the lids--quite a rich haul and very satisfactory to the\r\ncraving of his spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Girl examined them all carefully, and Wulfrey, watching her quietly\r\nthrough the smoke of his pipe, thought she handled them somewhat\r\ngingerly and distastefully, and understood her feeling in the matter.\r\nAnd now and again he caught also a glimpse in the mate's black eyes, as\r\nthey rested on her, of that which she herself had felt and resented.\r\n\r\nIt might be only the unconscious continuation of the gloating\r\nproprietorial look with which he regarded his treasures, which still\r\ngleamed in his eyes when they rested on her as though she herself were\r\nbut one more of them.  But whatever it was it was not a pleasant look,\r\nand Wulfrey was not surprised at her discomfort under it.  He was as\r\ndevoutly glad that he was there as she could be.  Alone with this wild\r\nriever, in whom the cross-strain of his wilder forebears was running to\r\nlicence in its sudden emancipation from all life's ordinary\r\nshackles....  It would not bear thinking of.  Yes, he was truly glad he\r\nwas there.  And then he remembered, with another grateful throb, that\r\nif he had not been there, neither would she have been.  For the mate\r\nmost assuredly would never have brought her back to life.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these are of value,\" she was saying.  \"But they are rather\r\npitiful to me....  Some dead woman has treasured them and she is gone.\r\nPerhaps you came upon her skeleton out there....  But they are not all\r\nreal stones----\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can ye tell that now?\" asked Macro gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell at once by the feel of them.  That now\"--pointing to a\r\nheavily-gemmed bracelet--\"the emeralds are real, the rubies are real,\r\nbut they are all small.  The white stones are not diamonds, but very\r\ngood imitations.  They look almost as well, but they are not diamonds.\r\nIf they were that bracelet alone would be worth some hundreds of\r\npounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deil take 'em!  And you can tell that by feeling at 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell in a moment.  You see I have handled many jewels--some of\r\nthe finest in the world, and I have seen very many imitations of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deil ye have!  How that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have lived among those to whom they belonged, and I am very fond of\r\nprecious stones.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away to his own cabin and came back presently with a good-sized\r\nbundle done up in blue velvet, and opened it before her.  Wulfrey was\r\nsurprised at the extent of his treasure-trove.  For these were only his\r\nmost precious possessions.  He knew that he had in addition\r\nconsiderable store of silver articles which he had been allowed to\r\nexamine from time to time.\r\n\r\nIf Macro's idea had been to dazzle her with his riches he must have\r\nbeen disappointed.  For she greeted the display with a depreciatory\r\n\"T't--t't!\"--and said presently, as she picked out a piece here and\r\nthere for examination, \"It looks like a peddler's pack....  And it\r\nmakes me sad to think of those to whom they belonged....\"\r\n\r\n\"They've no further use for them.  And there's no telling who they\r\nbelonged to.  They're for any man's getting now,\" said Macro\r\ndefensively.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.  All the same ... For me--no!\" with a most decided shake\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n\"Are they good, or is there false ones among them too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many are good,\" she said, passing them rapidly and somewhat\r\ndistastefully under her delicate fingers, \"but not by any means all....\r\nYou have laboured hard to accumulate so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harder than ever I worked in my life before, but it suits me fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what good is it all unless you can get away from here and turn it\r\nto some good use?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll talk of that when I've got all I want, mebbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are like a miser then, ever accumulating and loth to spend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that!  Ye see I never had siccan a chance before,--nor many\r\nothers either.  Ye wouldna care for a ring or two, or mebbe a bracelet\r\nor a brooch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I could not.  It is good of you to offer, but ... no, I thank you.\r\nThey would always make me think of the skeletons out there.  Poor\r\nthings!\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't hurt, and they're aye laughing as if 'twas all a rare\r\njoke,\" which made her shiver with discomfort and draw her blanket\r\ncloser round her neck at the back.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said he, with a hoarse laugh, as he made up his bundle\r\nagain.  \"Folks has queer notions.  Ef 't 'adn't been for me----\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Doctor,\" she interposed quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Ay--and the Doctor there----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she cut him short, \"and it is very much nicer to be sitting\r\nhere by a warm fire than tumbling about on a mast out there.  I\r\nappreciate it, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was to restore the balance of his spirits, which had\r\nsuffered somewhat from the discovery that his treasure was not all he\r\nhad thought it, that made him apply himself more heartily than usual to\r\nthe rum cask that night.  By the Doctor's advice any water they drank\r\nfrom the brackish pools was mixed with a few drops of rum.  Macro\r\nalways saw to it that a cask was at hand, and he himself took but small\r\nrisks as far as the water was concerned.  But he could stand a heavy\r\nload, and as a rule it only made him sluggish and uncompanionable.\r\n\r\nThis night, however, as he sat dourly smoking, and taking every now and\r\nagain a long pull at his handy pannikin, it seemed to set him brooding\r\nover things and at times he grew disputatious.\r\n\r\nMiss Drummond had turned with obvious relief to the Doctor and said,\r\n\"These things do not interest you?\"\r\n\r\n\"As curiosities only, not intrinsically.  I never had any craving for\r\njewelry!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a feminine weakness, I suppose, though I have known men who\r\noutvied even the women in their display.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have simpler ways in the country, and more robust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe you're right, and mebbe you're wrong,\" growled Macro, as the\r\nresult of his cogitations.  \"I d'n know, an' you d'n know, an' Doctor,\r\nhe d'n know, an' none of us knows....  They're mebbe all right...  What\r\nthe deil wud folks want mixing bad stuff wi' good like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is done sometimes to make a larger show, and sometimes as a matter\r\nof precaution,\" said Miss Drummond quietly.  \"Those who have valuable\r\njewels are always in fear of having them stolen.  They have imitations\r\nmade, and wear them, and people believe they are the real ones.  It is\r\ncommonly done.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' is it a thief you wud call me for taking these?\"\r\n\r\n\"These are dead men's goods and dead women's, and you do not know whose\r\nthey were, so it is not stealing.  But, for me, I do not like them.\"\r\n\r\n\"An', for me, I do.  An' more I can get, better I'm pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each to his taste, and you are very welcome to them all.  Now, if you\r\nplease, we will forget all about them, and speak of pleasanter things,\"\r\nand she turned to Wulfrey and began questioning him as to his knowledge\r\nof London, which was not nearly so extensive as her own.\r\n\r\nThe mate smoked and drank and glowered across at them.  More than once\r\nWulfrey caught his glance resting balefully on The Girl.  More than\r\never was he thankful that he was there to look after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said The Girl to Wulfrey, as she sat busily sewing at her new\r\ndress on deck next morning, \"I do not like your mate as much even as I\r\nthought.  Do you know what I would do if you were not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would go and live on that other ship, or else among the sandhills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Either would be very uncomfortable.  I am glad I am here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks at me as though I were another piece of his treasure-trove,\r\nespecially when he is getting drunk.  If he had tried to wrap me up\r\nwith the rest in that blue bundle of his I should not have been very\r\nmuch surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought you ashore, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?  What use would that have been if you hadn't brought me back to\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much, I'm bound to say.  But I imagine he considers it gives him\r\nfirst claim on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"First claim?--for what?\" she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, on your regard, your gratitude,----\"\r\n\r\n\"My gratitude, if you like.  My regard--that goes only where I can\r\nrespect and esteem.  And for him--neither.  If he were never to come\r\nback again from over there I would not in the least regret it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as inevitable that these two should instinctively draw closer to\r\none another, as that their doing so should create something of a breach\r\nbetween them and the mate, and that he should feel and resent it.\r\n\r\nExcept the untoward circumstances of their lot there was practically\r\nnothing in common between him and them.  His outlook and aims were as\r\ndifferent from theirs as were his habits and upbringing.  Yet it did\r\nseem preposterous to them that three persons, situated as they were,\r\nshould not be able to live together in peace and good-fellowship.\r\n\r\nTo the ancients, without doubt, the gods would have been apparent\r\nbehind the slow-drifting white-piled clouds, and behind the storm-wrack\r\nand the mists, laughing at the perverse little ways of men, and\r\nwatching with interest the inevitable tangle produced among them by the\r\nadvent of a woman.\r\n\r\nSince the year one, two have found themselves good company and the\r\ncoming of a third has led to mischief.  And yet even that depends on\r\nthe spirit that is in them.  More than once, since he landed on the\r\nisland, Wulfrey had found himself wishing Providence had sent him\r\nhonest Jock Steele for company, and that it was the mate's bones that\r\nwere whitening out there in place of the carpenter's.\r\n\r\nWhether he himself would have fared so well, if he had not stuck out\r\nhis leg at risk of his life and helped the mate on to his raft, and so\r\nhad come ashore alone, he was not sure.  And again, whether, if he had\r\nbeen alone, he would ever have sighted The Girl on her mast, was\r\ndoubtful.  If they had much to put up with in Macro, they had also much\r\nto thank him for.  And so--to bear with him as well as they might and\r\ngive no occasion for offence if that were possible.\r\n\r\nBut it was no easy matter.  They were having a spell of fine weather\r\nwhich enabled him to go out to the wreckage every day.  And every night\r\nhe came home ravenous, and ate and drank and afterwards sat smoking\r\nwith scarce a word.\r\n\r\nIf they enquired how he had fared he growled the curtest of answers,\r\nand showed plainly that their polite interest in his doings was not\r\ndesired by him.  He showed them none of his finds, but sat smoking\r\ndoggedly, and occasionally gazing through his smoke at The Girl in a\r\nway that distressed and discomforted her.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing in it that Wulfrey could openly take exception\r\nto.  Even a cat may look at a queen.  The look in the mate's black eyes\r\nwas akin to that with which the cat favours the canary, when he licks\r\nhis lips below its cage;--if he only dared!\r\n\r\nStill, they were free of him during the day, and the discomfort of him\r\nat other times but drew them closer together.  But Wulfrey, watching\r\nthe man cautiously, saw in him signs and symptoms that he did not like,\r\nwhich bade him be prepared for a possible change for the worse in their\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, he was drinking more heavily than he had ever done since\r\nthey landed, and the drink and the brooding of his black thoughts might\r\nwell hatch out unexpected evil to one or other of them.  As he lay\r\nthere of a night, smoking and drinking, with a face of gloom and\r\nsmouldering fires in his eyes, he was more than ever like a sleeping\r\nvolcano which might burst forth in flame and fury at any moment.\r\n\r\nBut for the lurking possibilities of trouble, the cool way in which he\r\ndevoted himself to his own private concerns, and left them to attend to\r\nall the irksome little details of the common life, would have had in it\r\nsomething of the humorous.\r\n\r\nMiss Drummond was indignant and was for leaving him supperless when he\r\ncame home of a night.\r\n\r\nBut Wulfrey rigorously repressed his strong fellow-feeling therewith,\r\nand determined that no provocation should come from their side.  So\r\nthey continued to make ample provision for all, and the mate helped\r\nhimself as if by right.  If, however, good-feeling on the part of the\r\nmaker has anything to do with the compounding of cakes, as The Girl\r\naverred, those she made for the mate must surely have lacked flavour,\r\nfor her views on the matter were most uncompromisingly expressed, both\r\nby hands and tongue, as she made them.\r\n\r\n\"Does he look upon us as his servants, then?\"--with a contemptuous slap\r\nat the innocent dough.--\"To do all his work without so much as a 'Thank\r\nyou'?\"--another vicious slap.  \"--And to be glowered at as if one were\r\na rabbit that he wanted to devour!\"--cakes pitched disdainfully into a\r\ncorner till the time came to cook them.--\"No!--for me, I wish he would\r\nstop out there among his skeletons and trouble us no more.\"\r\n\r\nHer little tantrums at thought of Macro gave Wulfrey no little\r\namusement.  The vivacity of her manner as she delivered herself,\r\nblended as it was of Scottish frankness and French sparkle, made her\r\naltogether charming.  He soothed her ruffled feelings, however, by his\r\nown eulogistic appreciation of the cakes she provided for their own\r\nuse, and it was then that she explained to him how intimately the\r\ncharacter of a cake is associated with the feelings of its maker.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head a few days later, when the commissariat\r\ndepartment began to run low in certain essentials.\r\n\r\n\"We're almost out of flour and pork, Macro,\" Wulfrey said to him, as\r\nthe mate was preparing to set off as usual one morning.  \"Will you\r\nbring some back with you?\"\r\n\r\nThe black-faced one hesitated one moment, and then cast the die for\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know where to get 'em,\" he growled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know where to get them,\" and Wulfrey braced himself for the\r\ntussle.  \"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then--get 'em, and be ---- to you!\" and he leaped down on to his\r\nraft and set off for the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nWulfrey watched the mate's retreating figure for a minute or two and\r\nthen turned quietly to The Girl.\r\n\r\n\"Are you prepared to trust me completely, Miss Drummond?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely.  What is it you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot go on this way.  He is becoming insufferable.  Unless you\r\nhave anything to say against it, we will take possession of the other\r\nship--you and I, and leave him here to himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--let us go.  When shall we go?  Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make it habitable first.  It is as empty as a drum, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better, since we are overcrowded here with that man.  It is to\r\nget away from unpleasantness that we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall need fire,--that means sand for a hearth; and wood--we have\r\nheaps here; and cooking things--we will take our fair share, and our\r\nblankets.  Everything else I can get out yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allons!  Let us go at once and get them.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked carefully round the horizon.  \"The weather will hold for a\r\nday or two still, I think.  Today we had better lay our\r\nfoundations--sand, wood and so on.  Then tomorrow we will go out to the\r\npile and take our cargo straight to the other ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do we do first?\" she asked, abrim with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"We will take a load of wood across at once and then go for sand.  We\r\nwill leave the cabin open to air it and light a fire.\"\r\n\r\nShe was as eager as a child going to a new house, and when presently he\r\nhelped her up over the side of the other schooner, she tripped to and\r\nfro delightedly, and could hardly wait till he forced back the rusty\r\nbolts of the cabin hatch with a piece of wood, so impatient was she to\r\ninspect the new home.\r\n\r\n\"I like it better than the other,\" she said, as they stood in the\r\nlittle cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Why?  It seems to me just about the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man of gloom is not here.  It makes all the difference.\"\r\n\r\nThey got their wood on board, and he tumbled it down the fore-hatch,\r\nwhich was easier to handle than the main.  Then they went ashore,\r\nfilled a bucket with fresh water, got half a dozen rabbits and a supply\r\nof the pungent herbs....  \"Why so many?\" she asked, and he said\r\nquietly, \"I don't want to hit him below the belt,\"--at which she\r\nlaughed--\"We can afford to be generous.  The breach will be wide enough\r\nas it is.\"\r\n\r\nThen they loaded the raft with sand, and getting back to the ship,\r\narranged their hearth, and with his flint and steel succeeded at last\r\nbetween them in lighting a thin chip, which he ceremoniously handed to\r\nher and begged her to start their fire.\r\n\r\nAnd as she knelt and applied it, and coaxed and blew till the cheerful\r\nflames shot up with a crackling shower of sparks, and the thin blue\r\nsmoke streamed up the companion-way, still kneeling she waved her hands\r\nabove it and said, \"Light and warmth and comfort and peace!  God bless\r\nthe fire!\" and he endorsed it with a hearty \"Amen!\" and thought he had\r\nnever seen a fairer sight.\r\n\r\nWhen the mate got home that night, he was somewhat surprised to find a\r\nsupply of food and no objections made to his helping himself.  He\r\nchuckled grimly, and showed by his face and manner that he considered\r\nthe matter settled on eminently satisfactory lines.\r\n\r\nThey made no enquiries as to his doings and he volunteered no\r\ninformation.  Wulfrey and Miss Drummond talked together as if he were\r\nnot there.  He lay and smoked, and drank, and glowered at them.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he set off as usual, and when they had taken their\r\nblankets and their fair share of cooking-utensils across to the\r\n'Martha,' and got them all stowed away, Wulfrey turned to The Girl and\r\nsaid, \"Now I will go out to the store-house yonder and get all I can\r\nlay hands on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come too.  Perhaps I can help.  I am very strong, and I would\r\nrather go with you than wait here alone.  But I do not wish to see any\r\nskeletons if you can manage it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will try to keep clear of them,--if you are quite sure----\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we got to swim, as that man said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may have to.  You need not.  I will go out to the pile and make a\r\nraft, and take you across on it.  And all that will take time, so the\r\nsooner we're off the better.\"\r\n\r\nThey paddled across to the spit and hurried along to the point, as\r\nnondescript a pair as could well be imagined in disrespect of clothing,\r\nbut in all else that mattered--in all the great essentials that make\r\nfor vigorous life--in health, good looks, and high and cheerful\r\nspirit--pre-eminently good to look upon.\r\n\r\nFor work on the wreck-pile the less one wore the better; and so he was\r\nclad in one simple but sufficient garment, which consisted of a long\r\nstrip of linen wound many times round his waist and falling to the\r\nknees like a South Sea Island kilt.  And she wore one of the\r\nprehistoric woman's sarks which Macro had brought over from the pile,\r\nand a similar, but slightly longer, kilt which swung gracefully a foot\r\nor so above her ankles as she walked.\r\n\r\nHe carried an axe in his hand, and had a knife at his back, in a\r\nseaman's belt which he had unhooked from its owner's body out there on\r\nthe pile one day; and his face was somewhat grave and intent, since he\r\nwas considering the possibilities of Macro's violent rejection of the\r\nsituation he had himself created, and the consequences that would then\r\nensue.  But her bright face was all alive with the spirit of adventure\r\nand the novelty of this new departure.\r\n\r\n\"We look like Adam and Eve turned out of Paradise, and setting out to\r\nconquer the world,\" she laughed excitedly.  \"What would _your_ friends\r\nthink if they saw you so?\"\r\n\r\n\"What they thought wouldn't trouble me in the slightest.  If they\r\nunderstood they would understand.  If they didn't it would not matter.\r\nWe are doing what has to be done in the only way to do it.  See the\r\nbirds out there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are those really all birds?  I thought it was a cloud whirling about,\"\r\nand she stood and stared in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Listen and you'll hear them,\"--and every now and again the south-west\r\nbreeze brought them the thin strident wailing of the hungry myriads as\r\nthey swooped and fought for their living.\r\n\r\n\"They sound horrid,\" said The Girl, with a sudden shadow on her face.\r\n\"It is like the wailing of lost souls, as he said.  Do they never\r\nattack you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have had more than one fight with them.  But you can always escape\r\nby slipping down into a crack or jumping into the sea.  Where did you\r\nlearn to swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a cottage in the Isle of Wight for a year, when first we came\r\nfrom France, and I grew very fond of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see Macro over there?\" as they came to the end of the point.\r\n\"He's hard at work.  We'll tackle a different part.  If you will sit\r\ndown here and rest, I will get across and be back as soon as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I not come with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how deep the channels may be.  Sometimes we can wade\r\nacross, sometimes we have to swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind.  It can't make me any wetter than if I have to jump in\r\nbecause of the birds.  And I have been wetter still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.  It will save much time,\" and they waded out alongside one\r\nanother,--The Girl catching her breath at times with spasmodic little\r\njerks of laughter, as she stepped into unexpected depths or a wave came\r\nhigher than usual;--and he, intent as he was on the business in hand,\r\nyet mightily cognisant of her proximity and the penetrating and\r\nintoxicating charm of it.\r\n\r\nWhen, at one sudden plunge, she gasped and clutched wildly at his bare\r\narm, her touch sent the blood whirling through his veins.  He took her\r\nsoft wet hand, which was all of a tremble with excitement, in his\r\nstrong and steady one, and she gripped it tightly and drew new strength\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nOut on the great pile of wreckage in front, but somewhat towards their\r\nright, they caught glimpses now and again of Macro--a wild dark figure\r\nsilhouetted against the pale-blue sky behind--as he climbed to and fro,\r\nand stood at times, and swung up his arms and his club and smashed his\r\nway through to the desire of his heart.\r\n\r\nWulfrey worked round to the left, and so came upon a channel which they\r\nhad to swim.  He fastened his axe into his belt at the back and they\r\nstruck out together.  He watched her anxiously at first, but was\r\nsatisfied.  She swam well and knowingly; they soon touched ground\r\nagain, and another wade and another short swim brought them to the pile.\r\n\r\nThe Girl had been regarding it with curious eyes and ejaculations of\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\"But it is amazing!\" she jerked, when at last they clung to a ledge of\r\nthe chaotic jumble of flotsam and jetsam.  \"I never saw anything like\r\nit in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just as well.  Now we'll climb up here, and you will rest while\r\nI gather wood and rope and make a raft.  Then we'll see what fortune\r\nsends us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever are all those?\" she asked, when they had worked their way to\r\nthe top, and stood looking round.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the bones of the ships that have perished here.  There are\r\nhundreds of them half-buried in the sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the most amazing sight I ever set eyes on,\" she said again, and\r\nsat and gazed at it all while he worked busily at the raft.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, climbing up to her again at last, \"We will look for\r\nnecessaries first and take anything else we come upon that may be\r\nuseful.  Those barrels are pork, but they are too heavy for us to\r\nhandle----\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you break one open?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the birds would be on us like a shot.  Some of them have got\r\ntheir eyes on us already,\" and he pointed to them swooping watchfully\r\nround.  \"We did that once and had to fight and run for it.  Maybe we'll\r\ncome across some smaller ones before we're done.  Here's a small cask\r\nof rum.  We'll make sure of that,\" and he rolled and carried it to\r\ntheir landing-place, and they scrambled on.\r\n\r\n\"These barrels are biscuits.  Some of it may be good.  We'll bring the\r\nraft round for it.  Those small casks are flour.  It's only good in the\r\nmiddle.  We'll come round for one of them presently.  We want some\r\ncoffee.  We're sure to come across some sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Small square cases about so big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wonder what's in this great case.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon see,\" and he smashed at it with his axe.  \"Hardware.  We'll\r\nadd to our stock since it's here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this?  Oh, I wish I had an axe too.  I want to break open every\r\nbox we come to,\" and he laughed out at her quick surrender to the\r\nriever spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you laugh at me then?  It would surely be helping you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know just how you feel, and now you know just how Macro feels.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know just how he feels.  It must grow upon one.  I don't want any of\r\nthe things, but still I would like to break open and find.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better stick to business.  When we've got all we come across that\r\nwill be of service I'll hand you the axe and you can smash away at\r\nanything you like, except your toes....  No doubt what's in that box\r\nanyway,\"--for the ends of rolls of silk were sticking out of it.  \"I\r\nexpect Macro has been over this ground already.  Shall we take some?\"\r\n\r\nShe picked out several rolls, saying, \"They may come in useful, even if\r\nit's only to make our cabin as fine as his,\" and he stacked up the silk\r\nalong with a raffle of rope, which was always to the good.\r\n\r\nThey scrambled to and fro, so busily smashing open cases and discussing\r\ntheir contents that they took no note of the birds gathering above them\r\nin ever-increasing numbers.  Their ears had grown accustomed to their\r\nraucous clamour, and the fact that it had grown louder had not troubled\r\nthem.  But suddenly--they were delving into the side of a huge crate of\r\nblankets at the moment--the sky was darkened as by a cloud, and\r\nWulfrey, glancing up in fear of a change in the weather, jerked out a\r\nsudden exclamation which made her jump.  Then he crushed her roughly\r\ndown into a narrow black chasm between the blanket-crate and another,\r\nand dropped in after her, just as the cloud, grown bold by its\r\nincrease, came swooping down upon them.\r\n\r\nNever in her life had she imagined such a nightmare experience.  The\r\nbristling confusion of the wreckage, the shimmering blue sea beyond,\r\nthe very light and peace of day itself, all were blotted out in an\r\ninstant, and in their place was nothing but a prodigious whirling and\r\nswooping of vari-coloured feathered bodies, snaking necks, cold beady\r\neyes, pitilessly craving them as food, cruel curved beaks keen to rend\r\nand tear, and a hideous clamour of wild wailings.  The flutter and beat\r\nof myriad wings set the whole atmosphere throbbing, till the blood\r\ndrummed furiously in The Girl's ears and her head felt like to burst.\r\n\r\nShe shrank down on something that crackled and subsided under her,\r\nfeeling herself terribly bare to their assault.  Wulfrey reached out an\r\narm and groped for a loose blanket and dragged it over them and so hid\r\nthe nightmare from her.  His arm was bleeding when he drew it in.\r\n\r\n\"They will go presently when they find there is nothing to eat,\" he\r\nsaid into her ear.\r\n\r\n\"They looked as if they would tear one to pieces,\" and he could feel\r\nthe shudder that shook her.\r\n\r\n\"They would try if they got the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are awful....  Oh, listen!\"--as the rest of the cloud, sure that\r\nsuch a clamour portended food, whirled round their shelter, brushed it\r\nwith wings and feet, shrilled their needs and their disgust more loudly\r\nthan ever, and swept away to seek more satisfying fare elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe sound of them drifted away at last, occasional stragglers still\r\nswooped down to make quite sure there was not a scrap left, but\r\npresently these followed the rest and Wulfrey climbed up and looked\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said, and reached down a hand to her.  \"I think they've\r\ngone after Macro,\" and he hauled her up into the light.\r\n\r\n\"Your arm!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Only scratches.  No harm done....  What is it?\" for she was staring\r\nwith tragic face into the hole out of which she had just come.\r\n\r\nAnd looking down into it he saw that he had flung her bodily on to what\r\nhad been a skeleton, but was now only a confused heap of brittle bones.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but there was no time to pick and choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a horrible place.  Let us go home!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go at once as soon as we've found some coffee ... and I would\r\nlike another knife or two....  Look in that chest.  Macro has opened it\r\nfor us....  And if you find any tobacco, I'll thank you,\" and he rooted\r\nrapidly through one broken-open seaman's box, while she did the same by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Tobacco--I think,\" she announced presently, ... \"and a knife and a\r\ntinder-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another knife\" was his find.  \"And we'll take these two coats----\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--if any of those screaming deevils, as the mate calls them,\r\nshould come after us as we go back, you feel them less through a coat\r\nthan on your bare skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll come again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's quite easy to avoid them, you see.  And they soon go if they\r\nfind nothing eatable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hideous things! ... Will those cases be coffee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so....  We'll chance one anyway....  And those small casks are\r\nrice.  We're doing famously.  Is there anything else you would like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaps of things--spoons, forks, plates, stockings----\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are stockings----\" and he delved into his chest again.\r\n\r\n\"Truly--but twenty sizes too large.  These boxes all seem to have\r\nbelonged to men.  Let us get home before those awful birds come back.\"\r\n\r\nSo they returned to the raft and pushed it slowly along the pile, from\r\nplace to place, where the various portions of their cargo stood\r\nawaiting them, and Wulfrey wrestled manfully with casks and barrels and\r\nboxes in a way that would have astonished himself mightily three months\r\nbefore.  And The Girl, eager to help as far as she could--brushing\r\nshoulders with him as they hauled and lifted, their hands overlapping\r\nat times, their bare arms in closest contact as they struggled with the\r\ninsensate obstinacy of dead weights,--was very conscious of the play of\r\nthe corded muscles in his arms and back, and the energy and\r\ndetermination of the quiet resolute face.  And she was at once grateful\r\nand exultant in the knowledge that all the powers this man possessed\r\nwere at her service, and that, if occasion should arise, they would be\r\nexpended for her to the uttermost and without hesitation.\r\n\r\nShe experienced sensations entirely new to her.  She found them good.\r\nThey quickened her blood and stimulated her mind.  She had seen much of\r\nmen, more perhaps than most for her years, but men of a very different\r\ntype,--unmuscular, powdered and peruked and befrilled, with airs and\r\ngraces and velvet coats which hid the lack of virility within, and did\r\nduty for it to the world at large; men of wealth and highest culture\r\nand too often of meanest heart, self-seeking, intent only on their\r\npersonal satisfactions, self-forgetful only in the pursuit of ignoble\r\nends.\r\n\r\nIn every particular so different from this man.  She had met but very\r\nfew men whom she felt she could trust implicitly.  Some of the most\r\napparently sincere had proved the least worthy.  And they were the most\r\ndangerous.  They drew your trust, and so disarmed and then most\r\ntreacherously betrayed you.  Oh, she had seen it, time and again, and\r\nso her mind had come to look on men in general as beasts of prey, to be\r\ndreaded, and avoided except in the most open and superficial fashion.\r\n\r\nBut this was a man of another world.  She had met none like him.  He\r\nroused her and soothed her as none of those others ever had done, as no\r\nman before had ever done.\r\n\r\nShe had seen men as good-looking, perhaps, but in a very different way.\r\nWould they have looked as well, stripped of their trappings?  She\r\ndoubted it.  And never a man among them could or would, she was sure,\r\nhave handled these obdurate barrels and boxes as this man did.  Truly\r\nthey seemed to object to removal from their lodging-places as though\r\nthey were endowed with minds of their own.\r\n\r\nAnd she had trusted him implicitly, from the first moment she had\r\nlooked into his eyes, and recognised that it must be he who had drawn\r\nher back out of the closing hand of death.\r\n\r\n\"Better put that on,\" said Wulfrey, dropping one of the coats over her\r\nshoulders, when they had got everything aboard.\r\n\r\n\"Why?  I am quite warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have done our work now till we get to the spit.  No good chilling\r\nin the wind.  We're going to sail home,\" and he slipped on the other\r\njacket, and proceeded to rig up a sail and a steering plank as he had\r\nseen the mate do.\r\n\r\nThe Girl broke into a laugh at the change for the worse produced in\r\ntheir appearance by the jackets.\r\n\r\n\"You looked like a Greek or a Roman before,\" she said.  \"Now we both\r\nlook like gipsy tinkers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine feathers--fine birds?\" he smiled, as they hauled out past the end\r\nof the pile and began lumbering slowly homewards.\r\n\r\n\"Those awful birds!\" and she glanced anxiously round for them, but they\r\nwere busy a mile away and troubled them no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nThe Girl was glad enough of her old coat before they reached the spit,\r\nin spite of its demoralising effect on her appearance,--glad even to\r\nsnuggle down among the blankets, for, after the hard work of loading,\r\neven the south-west wind began presently to feel cool.\r\n\r\nThen came the discharging, and the transporting of their heavy weights\r\nto the smaller raft on the lake, which could not take more than half\r\ntheir cargo at a time.  So he took her and a portion across to the\r\n'Martha,' and she undertook to have supper ready by the time he got\r\nback with the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd surely she wrought pleasanter thoughts even than usual into her\r\ncooking that day, for it seemed to him, when in due course he sat\r\nopposite to her on the other side of their fire, that he had never\r\nenjoyed a meal so much in his life, deficient as it was in many things\r\nthat he had always regarded as needful.\r\n\r\n\"We have done a good day's work,\" he said, as he lit his pipe at her\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what he will say about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not let it trouble us.  He has only himself to blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you and he would have quarrelled if I had never come.\"\r\n\r\n\"We certainly would if he had taken the line he has done.  As long as\r\nhe did his fair share of the providing I did not mind.  But the\r\nposition he took up was an impossible one.\"\r\n\r\nThey fell into reminiscent talk of that great outer world which seemed\r\nso remote, and from which, for all they knew, they were now for ever\r\ncut off.  She had many strange recollections of her earlier life in\r\nFrance, some very terrible ones of the times of the Red Deluge, very\r\nmixed ones of the later times in England.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing to him to sit in that bare cabin of a deserted ship, on\r\nan island shunned by all, listening to her familiar talk of men and\r\nwomen who had been but names to him, until her intimate knowledge of\r\nthem made them into actual living personages.\r\n\r\nHer outlook on life had been very much wider than his own.  She had\r\nlived among the scenes and people of whom he had only read in the\r\nnews-sheets.  He was immensely interested, both in the things she\r\ntalked about and the way she talked about them.  His questionings\r\ntowards a clearer understanding on points which were to her matters of\r\nsimplest elementary knowledge amused her not a little.  And he got many\r\na self-revealing glimpse into that strange past life of hers, from\r\nwhich she was so contented to escape, but which was yet so full of\r\ncolour and contrast and vivid actuality that, in spite of all its\r\ndiscrepancies and disillusionments, it had assumed for her a certain\r\nglamour which she averred it had never worn at the time.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" he would say, breaking into her flow of reminiscence,\r\n\"'Monsieur' is----?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Comte de Provence, the late King's brother, my uncle.  My father,\r\nthe King's next brother, the Comte d'Artois, is 'Monseigneur.'  He has\r\nbecome terribly devout since Mme de Polastron died.  The abbe Latil is\r\nhis heart and mind and conscience.  In his way he was fond of me, I\r\nbelieve, but since I came to understand the wrong he did my mother, I\r\nhave detested him.  And I have no doubt he was not sorry when I broke\r\naway.  I was a perpetual reminder, you see----\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is another Countess d'Artois?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,--Marie Therese of Savoy, but she is too awful,--a quite\r\nimpossible woman, one must say that much for him.  If ever a man had\r\ngood excuse for seeking his pleasures elsewhere, he had.  She was\r\nterrible.  She had no more moral feeling than a cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Madame Adelaide----?  Let me see--who was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"My great-aunt--poor old thing!  Those atrocious Narbonnes lived on her\r\nand turned her round their fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Madame Elizabeth?  It is terribly confusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  It is all as simple as can be.  Madame Elizabeth was my\r\naunt, my father's sister.  She was very sweet.  Poor dear!  They cut\r\noff her head, though she never harmed a soul since the day she was\r\nborn.  She was very good to me.  If she had lived I do not think I\r\nwould be here.  She was not like the rest.  I could have lived happily\r\nwith her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so she chattered away,--about the late King--her uncle also,--and\r\nof the Duc d'Orleans,--\"always a self-seeker, and intriguer, with a\r\nvery sharp eye on the way things might turn to his own benefit.  Oh, I\r\nam glad they took his head off.  It was righteous retribution.\"--And of\r\nthe Queen----  \"She did foolish things at times, but she meant no harm,\r\nand, mon Dieu, how she suffered!\"--And of Lafayette, and Talleyrand,\r\nand many and many another.\r\n\r\nAnd it was indeed passing strange to lie there listening to it all--she\r\nclad in her blankets, for the night air had a chill in it, and he in\r\nthe sea-damaged coat and small clothes of a gentleman of the Duke of\r\nKent's suite, while between them the thin blue reek of the drift-wood\r\nfire on its hearth of sand stole up through the half-closed\r\ncompanion-hatch to the lonely night outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\"We shall have a visit from our next-door neighbour presently, I\r\nexpect,\" said Wulfrey, when The Girl came out of her cabin next\r\nmorning.  \"Will you mind stopping below while I dispose of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"He puts things coarsely at times, and he will probably be in a very\r\nbad humour at having to get his own meals ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I, except on your account.  But I shall feel happier if you are\r\nout of sight and hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well.  But nothing he could say would trouble me in the\r\nslightest.\"\r\n\r\nSo, after breakfast, she sat down on the cabin floor to her sewing, and\r\nhe lit his pipe and went up on deck carrying his axe.  He closed the\r\ncompanion-doors and hatch very quietly--but she heard him--and went\r\nforward into the bows, which, since the usual wind blew from the\r\nsouth-west, was the nearest point to the 'Jane and Mary.'\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before the mate showed any signs, beyond an extra\r\nrush of smoke when he made up his fire to cook his breakfast.  But he\r\ncame up at last, caught sight of Wulfrey, and stood scowling across at\r\nhim for a time.  Then he dropped down on to his raft and came wobbling,\r\nwith quick angry strokes, across to the 'Martha.'\r\n\r\n\"So that's it, is it?\" he growled, with a grim look on his dark face.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said Wulfrey coolly.\r\n\r\n\"And you think you've got her all to yourself?--what you've been\r\nplotting for ever since I hauled her ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you speaking of Miss Drummond?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm speaking of that girl.  'Twas me hauled her ashore an' she's my\r\nright if she's anybody's.\"\r\n\r\n\"There it is, you see.  She is nobody's right but her own.  And neither\r\nshe nor I are your servants, to prepare your food and see to your\r\ncomfort while you dig treasure out of the wreckage.  So we have decided\r\nto fend for ourselves and you can fend for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  You think so, do you?  We'll see about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We undertake not to go aboard your ship if you give your word not to\r\ncome aboard ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"See you ---- first!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!  Then now we know how we stand, and will act accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, now you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will act accordingly,\" emphasised Wulfrey once more.  \"I must ask\r\nyou to keep off,\" as the mate paddled alongside and reached up a rough\r\nhairy hand to the side.  \"I'm sorry it's come to this, but I won't have\r\nyou on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't, eh?\" and as he reached up the other hand and prepared to mount,\r\nWulfrey picked up his axe and held it threateningly above the clinging\r\nhands, which straightway loosed their hold amid a volley of curses.\r\n\r\n\"---- ---- ---- ---- you!  You'd maim me! ---- ---- ---- ---- me, if I\r\ndon't pay you for this!  The girl's mine.  I found her.  I'll get her\r\nover your dead body if needs be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  And who found you?  And where would you be if I hadn't helped you\r\non to the raft yon first night?  Tell me that, will you?  By the same\r\nrule you're mine, and all you've got is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"---- ---- ---- ---- you for a ---- ---- ---- sea-lawyer!\" foamed the\r\nmate, his dark face and eyes all ablaze, his shaking fists hurling\r\ncurses beyond the compass of his tongue.\r\n\r\nWulfrey, eyeing him professionally, said to himself, \"Too much rum.\r\nHe'll have D.T. if he doesn't slack off--or a fit if he does much of\r\nthis kind of thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate thrashed back to his own ship with furious strokes and climbed\r\naboard, and Wulfrey, having watched him safely up the side, went down\r\nto The Girl.\r\n\r\n\"He is very angry,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"He did not whisper.  I couldn't help hearing him.  What will he do\r\nnext?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can only wait and see.  We shall have to be on our guard, but we\r\nwon't let him trouble us.  He is drinking too much.\"\r\n\r\nThey saw nothing more of him all that day, not even his head above the\r\nbulwarks.  Wulfrey surmised that he was probably treating his wrath\r\nwith rum, and plotting mischief, or maybe he was lying dead drunk in\r\nhis cabin.  They themselves were well provided in all respects, but he\r\nhad good reason to know that stocks across there were running low, and\r\nthat before long the man of wrath would have to go abroad to make up\r\nhis deficiencies, and that would give them the opportunity of getting\r\nin fresh water and rabbit-meat.\r\n\r\nHe could only hope the mate would not postpone his journey too long,\r\nfor the weather seemed like changing.  There was no sun visible, not a\r\nspeck of blue sky, but in their place a wan-white opaqueness which\r\nlooked portentous and might mean anything.\r\n\r\nWulf spent most of the day on the alert, leaving the deck only for\r\nmeals, and popping up even in the middle of them to make sure that all\r\nwas right.  But Macro made no sign.\r\n\r\nThere was no knowing, however, what a furious, rum-fuddled man might\r\nattempt.  His crazy jealousy and anger might stick at nothing, and\r\nWulfrey looked forward to a watchful night as a necessity.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he paced the deck, he ruminated on the handicap imposed by\r\nvirtue on an honest man when fighting roguery.  Here was Macro at\r\nliberty to sleep without fear of assault, to go ashore for water and\r\nfresh meat, and to the wreckage for everything he wanted, assured in\r\nhis own mind that no one would rifle his stores, or fire his ship, or\r\nplay any other dastardly trick, in his absence.  While they, if they\r\nleft their stronghold unguarded for an hour, must be exposed to all\r\nthese things, and constant watchfulness would be necessary to prevent\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant prospect and he did not see how it was going to\r\nend.  At the same time he did not see what other course had been left\r\nto them, and he was determined to go through with this, cost what it\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nThe thought of striking down this man with whom he had lived in\r\nfellowship, even in fair fight, was abhorrent to him.  The thought of\r\nbeing struck down himself made his blood run cold on The Girl's\r\naccount.  Both possibilities must be avoided if possible.  The latter\r\nat all hazards.  If it came to the mate suffering or The Girl, the mate\r\nwould have to go without compunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nThe night passed without disturbance, the morning found them swathed in\r\ndense white mist which hid one side of the ship from the other.\r\n\r\n\"He did not come again?\" asked The Girl when they met.  \"I am ashamed\r\nto have slept so soundly.  I intended to take my fair share of the\r\nwatching.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no need.  I bolted the doors and slept at the foot of the\r\nstairs.  It's all cotton-wool outside.  You can't see a couple of feet.\r\nHe won't venture out in that, if I know him.  But we need water.  I'll\r\ngo across after breakfast and get some.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall come too.  I wouldn't stop here alone for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.  Our only difficulty will be in finding the shore and\r\ngetting back to the ship.  Fog is terribly bewildering.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can find the shore we can get back all right,\" she said, after\r\nthinking it over.\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have that heap of rope you brought over.  Could we not untwist some\r\nand make a cord?  Then if we tied one end to the ship and carried the\r\nother ashore we could feel our way back by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will take a lot of untwisting.  We're quite two hundred yards from\r\nthe shore.  But it's worth trying.\"\r\n\r\nSo they untwisted rope till their fingers were sore, and tied the\r\npieces together till he judged they had enough, and presently they\r\nembarked noiselessly on their raft and paddled in the direction in\r\nwhich he believed the shore lay, The Girl paying out the string as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThis weird envelopment of dense white mist was a new experience for\r\nher.  She could barely see the water a foot or two away.  The string\r\nslipped through her fingers and vanished into the fog-wall.  Dale,\r\nsweeping the water with his oar, loomed dim and large just above her.\r\n\r\nThey went on and on, but found no shore.\r\n\r\n\"The string is nearly all done,\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Then we're going wrong,\" he whispered.  \"Don't speak loud, we don't\r\nknow how near we may be to----\" and, as if to confirm his fears, a\r\ngreat black bulk appeared in the clammy white above them, and Wulfrey\r\nhurriedly checked their way and backed off into the fog again.\r\n\r\n\"'The Jane and Mary,'\" he whispered, when they had put a space between\r\nthem and it.  \"We've been circling round.  The shore must be this way,\r\nI think----\" and the cord slacked in The Girl's fingers as he struck\r\noff to the right, and in due course they made the beach with cord to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\nThey tied the precious guiding-line to the raft and set off with their\r\nbuckets, Wulfrey trailing his oar behind him so that by its mark in the\r\nsand they might grope their way back.  In his belt he carried the only\r\nweapon he possessed, his axe, which, as matters stood with the mate, he\r\ndeemed it advisable always to have at hand.\r\n\r\nKeeping along the edge of the lake till he judged they were opposite\r\nthe ponds, they struck inland, and managing to keep a straighter course\r\nthan on the water, came at last to their goal.\r\n\r\nThey filled their buckets and were returning on their trail, bending\r\nevery now and again to make sure they were right, when, with an\r\nabruptness that startled the buckets out of their hands, a dark figure\r\nloomed up on them out of the fog and they found themselves face to face\r\nwith the mate.\r\n\r\nHe had heard them coming and was ready.  Wulfrey had barely time to\r\ndrop his oar and pluck out his axe when the other sprang at him with\r\nhis weapon swung up for the blow.\r\n\r\nIt was very grim.  Of all fighting-tools the axe is the most\r\nbrutal--after, perhaps, the spiked club and the scythe-blade tied on a\r\npole, which are only fit for savages.  It is cumbersome and ungainly.\r\nIt admits of little skill either in attack or defence.  Its arguments\r\nare final and convincing, and its wounds are very ghastly.\r\n\r\nThe Girl could barely make out which was which, so thick was the\r\nveiling fog.  But that did not matter.  She sprang in between the two\r\ndark figures with arms outspread, at imminent risk of receiving both\r\ntheir blows, crying, \"No!--You shall not!  You shall not!\"\r\n\r\nThe mate hurled oaths at her.  She thought he was going to strike her\r\ndown.  And past her, at Wulfrey,--\"---- ye!  It's like ye.  Steal her\r\nfirst, then hide behind her!\"\r\n\r\nWith one big black hand he gripped her blanket cloak and whirled her\r\naway into the mist, and came plunging at Wulfrey, who stood with poised\r\naxe and eyes that watched his every movement.\r\n\r\nThe mate played round him for an opening.  Out of the corner of his eye\r\nhe saw The Girl groping about for the oar.  He rushed in to end it with\r\none crushing blow.\r\n\r\nBut Wulf was ready for him and he was the cooler man.  As the mate's\r\naxe came swooshing down straight for his shoulder and neck, his own\r\nswung round, caught the other full in the blade with its own stout\r\nback, and with a ringing click sent it flying, with such a shock to the\r\narm that had held it that the mate believed it was broken.  He ducked\r\nwith an oath and disappeared into the fog.\r\n\r\nThe Girl came panting up, her face all sanded with her fall, her eyes\r\nablaze.  \"Did it reach you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  I'm all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"The brute!  I feared he would kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did his worst....  What were you going to do with that?\"--the oar\r\nshe had picked up.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to smash him on the head with it, but I couldn't find it\r\nat first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two to one!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care.  I'd have killed him if I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about our water?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all spilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go back for more.  He won't come back.  I doubt if he'll find\r\nhis axe in this fog.  Which way now?\" and he stood puzzling, for force\r\nof circumstance and much trampling of the sand had lost them their\r\nclue.  \"You cast round that way for the mark of the oar, but don't go\r\nfar.  I'll try this side.  Call if you find.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" she cried, almost at once, and he followed her voice into the\r\nfog and found her standing on the line.\r\n\r\nBut so confused were they that even then they had not an idea which way\r\nto follow it.\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\" she asked, staring down at the groove under her feet.\r\n\r\n\"This, I think....  I don't know,\" and he stood perplexed, \"There is\r\nnothing for it but following it up and seeing where we come to.\"\r\n\r\nSo they picked up their buckets, and he took the oar, and they set off\r\nagain,--and came out at last, not on the green undergrowth which\r\nflourished round the ponds, but on the bare shore of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Now we know where we are at all events.  Dare you stop here while I go\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then!\" and they turned and went back, and he discoursed of\r\nfogs as they went.  \"Nothing like a fog for absolutely confusing one's\r\nsense of direction.  I've known people wander for hours on a common,\r\nround and round, quite unable to get anywhere.  And one soon gets into\r\na panic and common sense goes overboard.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not had much experience of fogs, but expressed herself\r\nvehemently on the subject, and so they came to the ponds, and back, in\r\ntime, to their raft.  And Wulfrey was mightily glad to see it again,\r\nfor the idea had been troubling him that Macro might have found it, and\r\nset it adrift, or gone off to their ship to find solace there for his\r\ndiscomfiture ashore.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where he's got to?\" he said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care.  I wish he'd get lost in the fog and never come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You feel strongly,\" he said, with a smile at her vehemence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I like or I dislike, and both to the full.\"\r\n\r\nThe guiding-line led them safely home, and glad they were to get there,\r\nfor the chill of the fog and the treacheries it held were enough to\r\nweigh down the staunchest of spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTheir experiences in the fog had occupied many hours, and the unusual\r\nstrain had left them both somewhat lax and weary.  By the time they had\r\nprepared and eaten their much-delayed meal, and were enjoying the\r\nafter-rest, the thick whiteness outside had turned to chiller gray, and\r\nthe comfort of a blazing fire was eminently agreeable.\r\n\r\nWulfrey closed the companion-doors and hatch, all except the narrowest\r\ncrack through which the smoke could escape, lit his pipe, and lay at\r\nease, watching the many-coloured tongues of the dancing flames and The\r\nGirl who sat gazing dreamily into them on the other side, and wondered\r\nhow it would have been with them all if Macro's vicious blow had got\r\nhome on his neck.\r\n\r\nShe was very good to look upon as she sat there in the flickering\r\nhalf-darkness.  The gracious curves of her supple young figure\r\ntransformed the bare little cabin into a Temple of Youth and Beauty.\r\n\r\nThe dusky glamour of her hair, the shadowy beauty of her dark soft\r\neyes, the level brows and wide white forehead which gave such strength\r\nand dignity to her face--they all held for him an arrest and an appeal\r\nsuch as he had never before experienced.\r\n\r\nShe had made herself a robe out of a piece of the crimson silk they had\r\nbrought over from the pile.  It was hardly a dress, for it swathed\r\nabout her in flowing folds rather than fitted to her.  But he thought\r\nhe had never seen so becoming a garment.  It was sheer delight to lie\r\nand look at her.\r\n\r\nBut it was a sufficiently difficult problem that faced him.  In his\r\npresent state of mind, the mate seemed determined to make an end of him\r\nthe first chance that offered.  Was there any reasonable hope of a\r\nchange for the better in him?  Were they to live in a perpetual state\r\nof defence till one of them went under?--all the advantages of\r\nunscrupulous attack being left to the enemy.  Was it reasonable?  If\r\nnot, what was to be done, and how?\r\n\r\nThe man had suddenly become a deadly menace.  He was no better, in his\r\nunprincipled cravings, than a wild beast.  If that girl fell helpless\r\ninto his coarse hands....  And she knew it and looked to him for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nAnd protection to the utmost of his powers she should have....  Was he\r\njustified in slaying the man? ... In view of the deadly intent of this\r\nlatest attack he thought he was.  But whether he could bring himself to\r\nit, if the chance offered, he was not by any means sure....  The\r\ndeliberate killing of one's fellow was a serious matter....  In\r\nself-defence of course one was justified....  As to the law--it seemed\r\nas though the mate was right in his belief that they were destined to\r\nspend the rest of their lives--some of them at all events--on this bare\r\nbank of sand, where none ever came who could help it, and where no law\r\nbut that of Nature obtained....  But there was a higher law.  \"Thou\r\nshalt not kill.\" ... Yes, it would be very much against the grain of\r\nhis life and conscience, but it might have to be....\r\n\r\nHe sat up suddenly, listening intently.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked The Girl, startled out of her own reverie.\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand for silence.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I heard a cry,\" and he got up, and went up the steps, and\r\nopened the door and stood there straining his ears into the clammy\r\ndarkness.  The fog lay thicker than ever.  It was like listening into\r\nthe side of a bale of raw cotton.  The faint glow of the fire below\r\ndied against the opaque wall in front.  It could not have been seen a\r\nyard away.\r\n\r\nThe Girl stood on the stairs close behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I must have been mistaken,\" he murmured, \"or perhaps it was a\r\nseagull,\"--when, just below and almost alongside them, there came the\r\nviolent sweep of an oar used as a paddle, and a wild spate of curses\r\nlike the furious outburst of a panic-stricken brain.\r\n\r\nWulf slipped noiselessly down for his axe and stepped up on deck.  If\r\nhe went past, well and good.  If he ran into them----\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden bump against the side of their ship and the sound\r\nof a fall on the raft.\r\n\r\n\"---- ---- ---- ---- ye, ye ---- ---- rotten old coffin!  I've got ye\r\nat last, ---- ---- ----!\" and right up out of the fog under Wulfrey's\r\nnose came two clammy black hands clawing nervously at the bulwark.\r\n\r\n\"You can't come aboard here, Macro,\" he said quietly.  The grimy hands\r\nloosed with a startled oath and the mate dropped back on to his raft.\r\n\r\n\"----!  That you again?  ---- ---- ---- ---- you!  I thought....  Then\r\nmy ---- craft must be over there.  ----  ---- ----!  I'll do for you\r\nyet, my cully!\" and the oar dashed into the water again and he cursed\r\nhimself off into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"You could have killed him,\" gasped The Girl at his side, through her\r\nchattering teeth.\r\n\r\n\"I could--but I couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have no peace while he lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear not.  Still--I couldn't cut him down in cold blood like that.\r\nWhat would you have thought of me if I had done so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have said you had done well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you better.\"\r\n\r\nAt which she shook her head.  \"You don't know what horrid thoughts\r\nwhirl about in my mind.  No man really knows what a woman thinks,\" and\r\nthe frank dark eyes regarded him solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"I know you better than you do yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" with another shake of the head.  \"But, even then, it\r\nmight have been best,\"--with a shiver--\"It sounds horrible--but----\"\r\n\r\nHe could understand all her feeling in the matter.  In her place he\r\nwould have felt just the same.  The man was a hideous menace--to her\r\nespecially--and there would be no security for them while he lived.\r\nBut all the same....\r\n\r\n\"Let us get back to the fire,\" he said quietly.  \"He won't come back\r\ntonight.  Poor wretch, he's probably been paddling about all day\r\nlooking for his ship and he's half crazed with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I am bloodthirsty by nature,\" she said, with her hands\r\npressed tight to her eyes, when she had sunk down before the fire\r\nagain.  \"But I fear that man with all my soul, both for myself and you.\r\nHe will kill you if he gets the chance.  If he kills you I shall kill\r\nmyself.  It is better that one should die than two.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree, but I don't want to have the killing of him if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killing is horrible,\" and she shivered again, \"But being killed is\r\nworse ... and to fall into the hands of a man like that would be even\r\nworse still.  What will be the end of it all?\"\r\n\r\nBut that was beyond him, and their hearts were heavy over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\n\"Is it often like this?\" asked The Girl depressedly, on the third day\r\nof mist.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there's a good deal of it.  We've had it three or four\r\ntimes since we came.  It may be worse in the winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish so too, but I don't see how we're to manage it ... unless,\r\nsometime, a boat washes ashore among the wreckage.  And even then ...\r\nwithout Macro to manage it...\" and he shook his head unhopefully.  \"...\r\nIn the meantime I count it marvellous gain that you should have\r\ncome----\"\r\n\r\nAnd at that it was her turn to shake her head.  \"I don't know.  I seem\r\nto have brought more harm than good.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has made all the difference in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it has set you two by the ears and put you in peril of your life.\r\nThat is not a good work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your company more than compensates.  Besides, we should probably have\r\ngot to loggerheads in any case, and without anything like so good a\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been better, I think, if you had let me go when I was so\r\nnearly gone, and not rubbed me back to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank God that you came,\" he said weightily.  \"Without you we might\r\nhave sunk into savages, caring only for the lower things.  You lift me\r\nwithout knowing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't sink into a savage.  He is one naturally.  And I am\r\nbecoming one, for I am all the time wishing he were dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be having a bad time, unless he brought over provisions that\r\nlast time, and I doubt if he did.  He's probably living chiefly on rum.\r\nAnd that won't bring him to any better frame of mind, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"To think,\" she mused, \"that three people cannot live on an island big\r\nenough to hold thousands, without quarrelling to the death!\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is not of our making, so we need not blame ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is.  I began it by coming ashore.  You ought to have let me\r\nstop out there----\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very much better here.\"\r\n\r\n\"----And you continued it by bringing me back to life.  You ought to\r\nhave let me die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.  I accept all the blame and rejoice in it,\" he said, with a\r\nsmile.  \"It is just the fog getting into you.  You'll feel differently\r\nabout it when the sun comes out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sun?  I don't believe we are going to see it again.  I don't believe\r\nit ever shines here or ever has done since the world began.  It is an\r\nisland of mist ... and we are just vapours----\"\r\n\r\n\"Macro's not anyway.  I wish he were.  He wouldn't trouble me in the\r\nslightest then.  He's a solid strong mixture of Spanish buccaneer and\r\nHighland robber, with a touch of volcano to keep the mixture boiling.\"\r\n\r\nBut the chill of the mist was upon her and nothing he could say availed\r\nto cheer her.  So he hauled out the rolls of silk they had brought\r\nover, and set to work decorating the cabin with them, and interested\r\nher out of her depression by the purposed mistakes he made.\r\n\r\nIt was the ravelling off of a long thread from one of the pieces of\r\nsilk he was cutting, that showed him the way to a new employment for\r\nher and the possibilities of a welcome addition to their meagre larder.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could twist two or three of these into a\r\nfishing-line?\" he asked her.  \"I've seen heaps of fish in the lake.  We\r\nmight try for some.\"\r\n\r\n\"And hooks?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you could spare me one of your big needles I think I could make\r\nsomething that might do.\"\r\n\r\nShe went at once and got him one, and then set to work on the line, and\r\nhe could hardly get on with his own job for watching her.\r\n\r\nShe was so eminently graceful in all her movements.  Her tall slender\r\nfigure, supple, shapely, and all softly rounded curves without a\r\ndiscoverable abruptness or angularity anywhere about it, lent itself\r\nwith singular charm to her present occupation.  After thoughtful\r\nconsideration of the matter, she unrolled one of the pieces of silk the\r\nwhole width of the cabin, then picking out a thread, she fastened the\r\nend of it to the woodwork and travelled along the side of the piece,\r\nbending and releasing it as she went.  The same with two more threads.\r\n\r\n\"Three ply will be strong enough?\" she asked, straightening up and\r\nlooking across at him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see what three ply feel like,\" and he went across and watched\r\nher while she twisted the threads tightly together with deft soft\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"I should think that would do,\" he said, running it between his finger\r\nand thumb.  Their hands met, and the touch of hers sent a quite\r\nunexpected thrill of physical delight tingling through his veins.  He\r\ndid not dare to look full at her for the moment, lest she should see it\r\nin his eyes.  But he was conscious to the point of pain of her close\r\nproximity,--somehow conscious too--and that quite unconsciously and\r\nwithout any reasoning on the matter--that, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nshe was no longer simply a beautiful and charming girl, but had become\r\nfor him the most beautiful and charming girl in all the world.\r\n\r\nHis heart felt suddenly too big for his body.  He could have taken her\r\nin his arms then and there, and crushed her to him, and smothered her\r\nwith hot kisses.  And he could no more have done it than he could have\r\nbrained her with his axe.  For she trusted him implicitly, and he was\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath to give his heart more room, and bent to examine\r\nher twist.\r\n\r\n\"It will do splendidly,\" he said, and she glanced quickly at him and\r\nwondered what had made that curious change in his voice.  \"How will you\r\nkeep it rolled tight like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking.  If I greased my fingers with some of that pork\r\nfat as I roll it, and roll it very tight, it will probably keep so.\r\nHow long will you want it?\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as you can make it without too much trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make it the full length of that silk as far as I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do admirably....  If I can make as good a hook as you have\r\nmade a line we will have fish for dinner,\" and he went back to the\r\nfire, where, with his axe and his knife and two rusty nails lashed\r\ntogether at the top to act as tweezers, he was endeavouring to bend a\r\nportion of her needle into a hook.\r\n\r\nAt the cost of some burns and cuts he managed at last to make something\r\ndistantly resembling one.\r\n\r\n\"It looks horrid,\" said The Girl when he showed it to her.  \"I shall be\r\nsorry for the fishes if they get that into them.\"\r\n\r\n\"So shall I.  But we'll not let them suffer long if they give us the\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nShe was as eager as a child with a new toy to put their work to the\r\ntest.  So he cut some small pieces of pork and embedded his hook in\r\none, and dropped it into the bed of mist over the side.\r\n\r\nAnd she leaned over, with her shoulder unconsciously against his,--but\r\nhe felt it, and rejoiced in the feel as keenly as ever Macro did in his\r\ntreasure-trove--and peered anxiously down at the line, of which she\r\ncould see but a couple of feet, and waited impatiently for results.\r\n\r\nHe put it into her hand, saying,\r\n\r\n\"If anything comes of it you shall have the honour of catching our\r\nfirst fish,\" but he held on to the slack behind.\r\n\r\n\"It's jerking,\" she whispered breathlessly, \"Oh, I'm sure there's\r\nsomething on it...\" and as she let go the line he gave it a jerk on his\r\nown account, then drew it quickly in and a plump astonished fish lay\r\njumping and twisting on the deck.  It was over a foot in length, very\r\nprettily coloured, dark blue with many cross-streaks and silvery below.\r\n\r\n\"Mackerel, I think,\" he said, and promptly knocked it on the head, to\r\nend its troubles and allow him the further use of his hook.\r\n\r\n\"The poor little thing!  I'm so sorry,\" she said, looking mournfully\r\ndown at the iridescent beauty.  \"I don't think I like fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll think better of it when it's fried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't touch it,\" with a vigorous shake of the head.\r\n\r\nSo he asked her to go down and make some cakes, and then caught another\r\nfish of a different kind the moment the bait reached the water, and a\r\ncouple more for breakfast next day, and was thereby much reassured as\r\nto the future of their larder.  He cleaned two of his fish and fried\r\nthem with some pork fat as soon as she had made her cakes, and\r\nproceeded to reason her out of her prejudice.\r\n\r\n\"You have eaten fish all your life, haven't you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, every fish has had to be caught before you could eat it.  They\r\ngenerally leave them to die.  But even that is probably only similar to\r\nour drowning, which is said to be about as pleasant a way as there is\r\nof going.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's horribly cold if you're lashed to a mast,\"--with a reminiscent\r\nshiver.  \"And being rubbed back to life is just as bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we are more merciful, because we kill them at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's horrible to think that everything we eat, except things that grow\r\nof course, has got to suffer death for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have always eaten these things without being troubled about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The killing has never been brought home to me so closely before.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Nature's law, you see.  Everything feeds on something else.\r\nThese fishes feed on smaller things.  And how do you know that when you\r\ncut a cabbage or a potato----\"\r\n\r\n\"How I wish I had the chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, most heartily.  But how do you know they don't feel it just\r\nas much, in their own dull way, as the pig did from which we get our\r\npork?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and sighed.  \"We can't get away from it, I suppose,\"\r\nand tasted the fish and found it good, and ate quite heartily though\r\nwith an appearance of protest.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said.  \"Some fishes lay millions of eggs at a time.  If\r\nthey all grew up the sea would be choked with them, as the earth would\r\nbe with animals if they weren't killed off.  Besides, unless I am\r\nmistaken in my recollection of our old parson's reading, all these\r\nthings were expressly provided for man's sustenance, so we are only\r\ndoing our duty in eating them.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same, I think I will let you do all the catching and killing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  That is the man's proper part in the family economy.  He\r\nis the bread-and-meat winner.  And the wife's--the woman's, I mean--is\r\nto see to the cooking,\" and he occupied himself busily with fish-bones,\r\nand felt like biting his tongue off for its involuntary slip.\r\n\r\n\"If you had lived on pork and rabbits for months you would find this\r\nfish delicious,\" he said presently, to break the odd little silence\r\nthat had fallen on them.\r\n\r\n\"It is very good.  I wonder you never caught any before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did try, but my tackle was too rough.  The fish would have none of\r\nit.  It is your clever line that has done the trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to be of some use, though I can't help being sorry for the\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if he had dared he would have delighted to tell her of what\r\ninfinitely greater use she was to him in other and higher ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nWulfrey was awakened in the night by the sounds he had come to\r\nrecognise as the accompaniments of bad weather.  The ship was humming\r\nin the wind and straining and jerking restively at the rusty cable\r\nwhich he was always expecting to give way.  He wondered sleepily what\r\nwould happen to them if it did.  Wondered also if The Girl was\r\nfrightened at the changed conditions, or whether she would understand.\r\nHe slipped on some clothes and went into the cabin, to reassure her if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe fire was a bed of white ashes and a rose-gold core in the centre.\r\nHe piled on some chips and the flames broke out with a cheerful\r\ncrackle.  The door of The Girl's little passage way opened an inch or\r\ntwo, and he caught a glimpse of her startled eyes shining in the\r\nfire-light.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid you might be disturbed by the storm,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe went back for a moment, and then came out with her blanket skirt\r\nand cloak swathed about her, and sat down by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"It woke me, and I cannot get to sleep again.  Oh ... what is\r\nthat?\"--as a shrill scream pealed out just above the opening in the\r\ncompanion-hatch.\r\n\r\n\"It's only those infernal birds.  They always come screeching round us\r\nin bad weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had just been dreaming that that horrid man came across in the night\r\nand murdered us both.  It was such a relief to see you alive again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of his venturing out in this weather.  Those screaming birds\r\nget on his nerves.  He'll be sitting drinking, and cursing them in the\r\nmost awful Gaelic he can twist his tongue to.  This weather will\r\nprobably last a couple of days.  Then it will slack up, and just when\r\nyou're thinking it's all gone it will come back worse than ever.\r\nFortunately we've got----  By Jove!\"--and he ran hastily up the\r\ncompanion, unbolted the door and ran out on deck.  The gale came\r\nwhuffling down on the fire and scattered the white ashes in a cloud,\r\nand set the silken drapery of the walls rustling wildly.  The shrill\r\nclamour of the birds sounded very close, and The Girl sat anxiously\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\nHe came back in a minute, empty-handed and disconsolate.  \"I just\r\nremembered my fish.  I left two up there for breakfast, but the birds\r\nhave had them.  They're as thick on the deck as bees on a comb, hoping\r\nfor more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?  I was afraid that man was coming and you'd heard him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It means living on pork till the storm passes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing.  We shall enjoy the other things all the more later\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm wondering all the time how Macro is getting on----\" he said,\r\npulling out his pipe and filling it.\r\n\r\n\"Why trouble about him?  He would not trouble about us if we were\r\nstarving.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose he would....  I suppose it comes of my being so in the\r\nhabit of helping people through their bodily troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wasted on him.  He would not let you help him if you could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he would, unless he were helpless....  I wish he'd\r\nnever come ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in that case I would not be here either, and you would have been\r\nall alone for the rest of your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, after all, I'm glad he came ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you would have gone mad in time with the loneliness of\r\nit,\" she said musingly.\r\n\r\n\"It would be horrible to be all alone for all the rest of one's life,\r\nbut I don't think I would have gone mad.  I've no doubt there are books\r\nto be found among the wreckage out there.  Still ... for the rest of\r\none's life!\"--and he shook his head doubtfully.  \"As things are,\r\nhowever....\"\r\n\r\n\"As things are?\" she queried, after waiting for him to finish.\r\n\r\n\"As things are, I am quite content to stop here for the rest of my\r\nlife, if that has to be.  But that won't stop my doing my best to get\r\naway if the chance offers....  And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were delivered from that man I could be content here also....\r\nBut I do not say for all my life.  That sounds terribly long....  But\r\nfor that man it would be a welcome retreat from a world of which I had\r\nhad a surfeit.\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered much if she were heart-whole.  It seemed almost incredible\r\nto him that she could have lived that strange life of hers without some\r\nman wanting and touching it.  So fair a prize, to go wholly unclaimed\r\nand undesired!  But never, in all her talk, had she said one word that\r\npointed to anything of the kind.  Rather had she held up the men she\r\nhad met to derogation and contempt.  Surely, if there had been anyone\r\nto whom her heart turned and clung, some evidence of it would have\r\nshown itself.\r\n\r\nFrom all she had said, from all her little unconscious\r\nself-revelations, and the wholesome judgment he had formed of her in\r\nhis own mind, he could well believe that, in that whirlpool of a world\r\nin which she had lived, she had come to hold most men in doubt and all\r\nat arm's length.  And the thought was agreeable to him.\r\n\r\nWhen the slow day broke, dim and clangorous with the gale, they dallied\r\nover a meal, talking of many things to pass the time, and then went up\r\non deck, and with a brandished stick he ridded the ship of the\r\nclustering birds.  They shrieked threateningly and came swooping at him\r\non the wings of the wind, with hungry beaks and merciless eyes.  But\r\nhere he was at home and would not suffer their invasion, and finally\r\nthey gave it up and fled to the sandhills, cursing him shrilly as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's one gone downstairs,\" cried The Girl; and running down\r\nafter it, he found a great black cormorant squawking fearfully round\r\nthe cabin and dashing itself against the walls in its wild attempts at\r\nescape.  At sight of him it grew frantic, but finally found its way out\r\nof the hatch again, almost upsetting The Girl in its passage, and then\r\ntore away to tell its fellows of the awful place it had been in, which\r\nsmelt so good but was so much easier to get into than out of.  Wulfrey\r\nhad to open one of the lee ports and let the gale blow through to get\r\nrid of the smell of it, and then he went up again to The Girl.\r\n\r\nThey watched the great rollers thundering on the beach beyond the spit,\r\nrocketing their white spume high into the grim black sky, and lashing\r\nover at times into the lake.  And when he called to her to look the\r\nother way she watched with amazement sandhills of size melt away before\r\nher eyes and re-form themselves in quite different places.\r\n\r\n\"But it is past words!\" she cried into his ear.\r\n\r\nThey stared long too at the 'Jane and Mary' of Boston, but saw no sign\r\nof life aboard of her except the birds that clustered there unmolested.\r\n\r\n\"It is a most amazing place,\" she said, when they went down again, as\r\nshe dusted the saltness out of her hair with her hand.  \"Is it often\r\nlike this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very often in the winter, I should fear.  We've had our best weather\r\nsince you came.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I want to live all my life here,\" she said dejectedly.\r\n\"I love the sun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would dearly have liked to tell her that he did the same, but\r\nthat for him she made more sunshine even than the sun itself.\r\n\r\nInstead, he prosaically set her to the making of more fishing-lines, in\r\ncase of accident to the one they had, and he himself hammered away at\r\nmore hooks, burning and ragging his fingers out of knowledge, but\r\nproducing hooks of a kind somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nThe gale slackened on the third day, and Wulfrey was actually relieved\r\nin his mind at the sight of Macro hurrying ashore on his raft, after\r\nfresh meat, and, from the fact of his buckets, water, which he had\r\nprobably been too careless, or too drunk, to secure during the storm.\r\nFor the thought of his possibly lying there alone and foodless had not\r\nbeen a pleasant one, good reason as he had for disliking the man.\r\n\r\nFor themselves, he baited and cast his hooks, and landed half a dozen\r\nfish as fast as he could haul them out.  Their fresh meat supply would\r\nhave to wait until Macro went out to the wreckage and their minds could\r\nbe at ease as to the safety of their headquarters.  The sea outside was\r\nstill too high for any possibility of his going that day, and\r\nfortunately, thanks to their new source of supply, they could wait with\r\nequanimity.  Water they had caught in plenty in the buckets slung under\r\nthe scuppers.\r\n\r\n\"He's alive at any rate,\" said Wulfrey, when he went down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse for us,\" said The Girl.\r\n\r\n\"He's been fasting, I should say, by the way he has gone off after\r\nrabbits.  We ate our first ones raw, I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Savages!\"\r\n\r\n\"Savage with hunger.  We had had nothing to eat but shell-fish and\r\nsea-weed for days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!--raw rabbit and sea-weed!\"\r\n\r\n\"We had no means of making fire, no shelter.  We slept out on the\r\nsands, and were glad to be simply alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm truly thankful you had risen to a higher state before I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I.  We were not good to look at.  We were as men who had died\r\nout there among the dead ships' bones and been born again on this\r\nsandbank, lacking everything.  Fortunately for us the years that had\r\ngone before had been unconsciously making provision for us, and here\r\nwere houses ready-made and waiting, and out there more than we could\r\nuse in a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nThey saw the mate return after a time with his supplies, and he never\r\nshowed head again all day.  Wulfrey let The Girl keep a look-out, and\r\ntried himself to get some sleep, in anticipation of the night-watch\r\nwhich he saw would be necessary.\r\n\r\n\"He will probably go out to the pile tomorrow,\" he said.  \"He must be\r\nout of flour and probably of rum.  Then we can take a run ashore\r\nourselves.  When he gets back he will probably be too tired to be up to\r\nany mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he would tame down and let us have peace, or else go and get\r\nhimself killed,\" she said anxiously.  \"We can't go on like this for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid he won't oblige us either way.  We can only hang on and\r\nhope for the best, and keep our eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nHis watch that night passed undisturbed.  In the morning, as he\r\nexpected, Macro set off for the wreckage; and, taking some food with\r\nthem, they went ashore for a long day's ramble.\r\n\r\n\"It is good to feel the width of land under one again,\" said The Girl,\r\nfairly dancing with delight.  \"I am very grateful for the ship, but\r\ntruly it is small and cramping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandhills are good for play-time, but you'd miss the ship when\r\nbed-time came.  It's cold work sleeping on the sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost as bad as sleeping on a broken mast.  Which way shall we go?\r\nYou are quite sure he has gone to the wreckage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure.  I watched him out of sight.  Besides, I am sure he had to\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go the opposite way, as far as we can, and we'll stop out\r\nall day long and behave like children.  I'm going to walk in the\r\nwater,\" and she kicked off her shoes and lifted her blanket skirt and\r\ntripped along in the lip of the tide, and he did the same, enjoying her\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nA watery sun shone feebly through a thin gray sky, the air was still\r\nheavy with moisture, the water in which they were walking was warmer\r\nthan that of the lake.  On that side, the island curved like the\r\nconcave side of a great half-moon.  The pale yellow sand stretched on\r\nand on as far as their eyes could reach.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to bathe,\" said she exuberantly.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we get beyond the end of our lake, then you can take this\r\nside and I'll go across to the other.  You won't go out too far?  There\r\nmay be under-currents that would carry you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be very careful.  And you must not come back for an hour...  Oh,\r\nwhat are those? ... Dead men?\"\r\n\r\nIn a tiny dent in the long sweep of the curve, made by the sandhills\r\nrunning almost down to the water, were half a dozen dark objects lying\r\non the dry sand and looking for all the world like dead bodies.  He had\r\nnever seen any jetsam of size on that side.  The drive of the storms\r\nand drift of the currents landed everything on the western spits and\r\nbanks.  Still there was no knowing.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here!\" he said, and set off towards them.  And she followed close\r\nat his heels.\r\n\r\nBut before they had gone many paces, one of the bodies set itself\r\nsuddenly in motion and began to shuffle towards the water.\r\n\r\n\"Seals,\" said Wulf, who had never set eyes on a live one in his life,\r\nbut had a general idea of what they were like.\r\n\r\nBefore they could reach them, all had flopped away except one, which,\r\nwhen they drew near, raised its head and eyed them piteously and made\r\nan effort to rise.\r\n\r\n\"It is sick or wounded,\" said Wulf.  \"Poor beast!  Its eyes are like a\r\nwoman's in----\"  He bethought himself and bit it off short.  He had\r\nseen just such a look in many a woman's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We won't disturb her,\" he said, and led the way round to give her wide\r\nberth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--look!  Oh, the little darling!  How I would love to cuddle it!\"\r\nwhispered The Girl, for there, on the other side of Mrs Seal, with her\r\nfront fins clasping it protectingly, was a late-born baby sucking away\r\nfor dear life.\r\n\r\nThe Girl's face was transfigured,--ablaze with intensest sympathy and\r\nthe wonderful light of mother-love.  The mother's eyes followed them\r\nanxiously, the fear in them died out as they backed slowly away, and\r\nshe bent her head to her baby and seemed to say, \"Thank you so much!\r\nYou understand, and I am very grateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ so glad we saw them.  I like the island better than ever I did\r\nbefore,\" said The Girl.  \"What a dear little thing it was!  And she was\r\njust delightful,\" and all day long she kept referring to them and to\r\nher joy at the sight of them.\r\n\r\nThey went on again, mile after mile, and whenever he glanced at her,\r\nher face was still alight with happiness, and unconscious smiles\r\nrippled over it in tune with her thoughts.  So inborn and unfailing is\r\nthe mother-feeling in all true women.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if you wish to bathe, here is a good place.  I will strike across\r\nto the other shore and will come back in about an hour.  Don't go too\r\nfar out!\" and he strode away across the hummocks.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the nearest sandhill she loosed her slender garments,\r\nand sped like a sunbeam across the beach and into the water; and her\r\nface, as it came up from the kiss of the sea, was like a sweet\r\nblush-rose all beaded with morning dew, than which no fairer thing will\r\nyou find.  And as she swam and dived and splashed in the lucent green\r\nwater, like a lovely white seal, her bodily enjoyment and her mental\r\nexhilaration flung wide her arms at times, as though she would clasp\r\nall Nature's joys to her white breast, and her eyes shone with a\r\nbrighter light than had the mother-seal's, and a seal's eyes are\r\ndeeply, beautifully tender and bright.\r\n\r\nShe laughed aloud at times, though none but herself could hear it, in\r\nthe pure physical joy of living and being so very much alive.  She was\r\nhappier than she had ever been in all her life before.  And one time,\r\nas she lay afloat with her arms outspread, she looked up at the pale\r\nsun in the thin gray sky, and all inconsequently said, \"Yes--he is\r\ngood.  He is good.  He is good,\" and her face was golden-rosier than\r\never when she was conscious that she had said it aloud.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting in the side of the sandhill, combing her hair with her\r\nfingers, when she heard his distant hail.  And she climbed the hill and\r\nwaved to him that he might come.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need to ask if you enjoyed your bathe,\" he said, as he came\r\nup.  \"I can see it in your face.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was delightful.  I would like to bathe every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two days ago?\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"No, days like this.  Oh, it _was_ so good!  And now I am hungry.  Let\r\nus eat.\"\r\n\r\nSo they sat in the wire grass of the hill-top and ate their frugal\r\nmeal, she with her wonderful hair all astream, the ends spread wide to\r\ndry on the sand; and he, clean, and strong, and brown, as fine a figure\r\nof a man as she had ever met, though his raiment was nothing to boast\r\nof.  And he said to himself, \"She is the most wonderful girl I have\r\never seen.  I would like to kiss her hair, her hands, her feet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she, to herself,--\"He is good.  He is good.  He is good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, buried deep in both their minds, yet fully alive, was the thought\r\nthat it might be that all their lives would have to be passed on that\r\nlean bank of sand--together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nOn their way back, Wulf lingered behind for a moment or two and came\r\nalong presently with rabbits enough for their requirements, but did not\r\nobtrude them on her notice.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a day of delight,\" she said, as they drew to their ship.\r\n\"Let us do it again....  I wonder if that man has got home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.  I can see his raft on the spit.  Just as well we're here\r\nbefore him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only he were not here at all----\"\r\n\r\n\"Even the original Paradise had its serpent.\"\r\n\r\n\"This one cannot beguile this woman at all events.\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark when they saw Macro's laden raft lumbering slowly\r\nacross to the 'Jane and Mary.'\r\n\r\n\"He won't starve,\" commented The Girl.\r\n\r\n\"Nor go dry.  I see at least half a dozen kegs there.  He's making\r\nprovision for bad weather.  The gale may blow up again during the\r\nnight.  See the birds whirling about over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you have to watch again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Safer so, though the chances are the kegs will keep him quiet for a\r\ntime.  He's probably been on short allowance the last day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is monstrous that you should have to.  I wish----\" and the petulant\r\nstamp of her stout little brogue conveyed no suggestion of a blessing.\r\n\r\n\"Time may work for us,\" he said quietly.  \"He is our thorn in the\r\nflesh----\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a whole axe if you give him the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't, I promise you.  I cannot afford to give him any chances,\" and\r\nshe knew that in that his thought was wholly for her.\r\n\r\nWulf dutifully patrolled his deck when it grew dark, though he\r\nacknowledged to himself that the precaution was probably unnecessary,\r\nfor this night at all events.  Still, he was there to protect The Girl\r\nand he would suffer no risks.\r\n\r\nIt was possibly the distant sight of him, tramping doggedly to and fro\r\nin the wan moonlight, that set Macro's rum-heated passions on fire.\r\nWulf heard him spating curses as he tumbled over on to his raft and\r\ncame splashing across.  He went quietly to the companion-way and closed\r\nthe door, then picked up his axe and stood waiting, with a somewhat\r\nquickened heart at the thought that the next few minutes might end the\r\nmatter one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\"---- ---- ---- ---- you, you white-livered skunk!  Come out and fight\r\nfor her like a man if you want her,\" was the mate's rough challenge,\r\nsupplemented by a broadside of oaths, as he drew near.\r\n\r\nWulf stood looking quietly down at him.  Words were sheer waste.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye hear me?  Come down an' fight it out like a' man, an' best man\r\ntakes her, ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- you!\"\r\n\r\nHe bumped roughly against the side and picked up his axe.  Curses\r\nfoamed out of him in a ceaseless torrent, and he made as though he\r\nwould come swarming over.\r\n\r\n\"Keep off,\" said Wulf.  \"If you try to come aboard I'll cut you down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come down then and fight it out if you're half a man, ---- ---- ----\r\n---- you!  What right have you to her, I'd like to know, ---- ---- ----\r\n---- ----!\"--he picked up his oar and whirled it round at Wulf's head\r\nand it splintered on the hard-wood rail.\r\n\r\n\"Get back to your ship, man, and don't make a fool of yourself,\" said\r\nWulf.  \"I won't fight you.  If you try to come on board here I'll make\r\nan end of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye skunk, ye!  Ye ---- ---- ---- white-livered cowardly skunk!\"--etc.\r\netc. etc.--to all of which Wulf made no reply, which provoked the\r\nfurious one more than any words he could have flung at him.\r\n\r\nHe remained there, hurling abuse and invective at the steady-faced man\r\nup above, till the night air cooled the boiling in his brain.  Then he\r\nseized his splintered oar and thrashed away home.  Wulf quietly resumed\r\nhis sentry-go, watched till all was quiet on the 'Jane and Mary,' and\r\nthen went down.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise The Girl was sitting by the fire.  He had supposed her\r\nin bed, had hoped she was fast asleep and had heard nothing of the\r\nbombardment.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has gone home to bed.  I was hoping you were asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Asleep! ... And you did not kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He gave me no chance.  He invited me on to his raft for a fight----\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry.  He is hardly suitable for a lady's ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel myself a terrible burden to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are not.  Very much the reverse.  You are----\" he began\r\nimpulsively, and stopped short.  It was too soon to tell all that she\r\nwas to him.\r\n\r\n\"I am a bone of contention.  I bring you in peril of your life----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I thank God I am here to protect you.  Now, take my advice and go\r\nto bed.  I will bring my blankets and lie at the foot of the stairs\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nThe next day passed without any sign of the mate, beyond the thin blue\r\nsmoke that floated up from his hatchway.\r\n\r\nWulf surmised that he was making up his leeway in the matter of food\r\nand drink, and would probably not be over-eager for battle for the time\r\nbeing.  Nevertheless he relaxed no whit of his vigilance, and after\r\nwatching on deck for half the night slept the rest at the foot of the\r\ncompanion-way as before.\r\n\r\nContrary to his expectations, the gale did not work itself up again,\r\nbut the sky was still low and dark and full of thin smoky clouds\r\nhurrying along towards the north-east, and he was not at all sure that\r\nthey had done with it yet.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, to their great satisfaction, Macro set off early\r\nfor the wreckage, and when they had watched him out of sight they went\r\nashore for a ramble, and to get water and fresh meat.\r\n\r\nThe Girl must of course make straight for the place where they had met\r\nMrs Seal and her baby, but, to her great disappointment, there was not\r\na sign of them.\r\n\r\n\"And I did so want to see them again,\" said she.  \"She would have known\r\nus by this time and not been afraid.  Perhaps she would even have let\r\nme touch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are much happier in the water,\" he said, with a smile, for her\r\nface made him think of a child who had lost its toy.\r\n\r\nShe would not be satisfied till they had searched far along the shore,\r\nbut nothing came of it, and she was disconsolate.  The day was not\r\ncheerful and she would not bathe.  They filled their buckets, and he\r\ncaught some rabbits and they returned early to the ship.\r\n\r\nHer humours appealed to him, even though he could not possibly\r\nunderstand them completely.  Everything she did, and the way she did\r\nit, and indeed everything connected with her, was coming to have a\r\nvital interest for him.\r\n\r\nHe could not know how the anguished fear in that mother-seal's eyes had\r\ntouched her heart, how she had yearned to pick up that sleek little\r\nbaby and fondle it in her arms, how she had been hoping and longing to\r\nsee them again, how great her disappointment had been.  She felt bereft\r\nand went off early to bed.\r\n\r\nWulf lay smoking and thinking till night fell, and then went up to do\r\nsentry.  He paced the deck till midnight, saw no sign of movement\r\naboard the 'Jane and Mary,' and went below and was soon sound asleep.\r\n\r\nHe woke once with a start, believing he had heard a footstep.  Then a\r\nripple clop-clopped against the side of the ship and he lay down again\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened again by a hand gripping his shoulder, and, starting\r\nup, found a ghostly white figure bending over him, and The Girl's voice\r\nin his ear,\r\n\r\n\"There is something wrong.  Can you not smell it?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he imagined her dreaming.  Then his nose warned him that\r\nshe was right.  There was something unusual in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEven when their fire was no more than a heap of gray ashes with a\r\ngolden core, and one of their lee ports was open, the faint, not\r\nunpleasant smell of wood smoke hung about the cabin.  But this was\r\nquite different,--an acrid, pungent smell as of burning fat.  He\r\nglanced at the fire and raked his mind for an explanation of it.\r\n\r\n\"It is worse in my room,\" she said, and he went quietly to the sacred\r\nlittle passage off which her sleeping-apartment opened.\r\n\r\nYes, it was worse there, and what it meant he could not imagine.\r\n\r\n\"You have not been burning anything?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  The horrid smell wakened me.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and ran up the companion-steps, with a vague idea that\r\nsomething in the hold might have caught fire, though how that could be\r\nwas beyond him.  There was nothing there but their reserve stores, and\r\ncertainly nothing that could take fire of its own accord.  Besides, it\r\nwas two days since he had been down there, and he never took a light,\r\nas the hatch, when shoved askew, gave all that was needed.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled the bolts of the little doors open, but the doors seemed\r\njammed.  He pushed.  They remained firm.  He made sure of the bolts\r\nagain and put his shoulder to the doors.  They resisted all his efforts.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" he said, in something of a panic.  \"What's all this?\"\r\n\r\nHe brushed hastily down past The Girl again, groped for his boots by\r\nthe side of his blankets, pulled them on, and picked up his axe, with\r\nthe certainty in his mind that something wrong was toward and it was as\r\nwell to be fully armed.\r\n\r\nThen he smashed away at the woodwork till it was in fragments, and he\r\ncould climb up through the bristling splinters and over an unexpected\r\nplank that had somehow got across the doors and prevented their opening.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he saw when he got on deck was a faint glow about the\r\nmain-hatch opening, and smoke pouring out of it.  Running to it, a\r\nglance showed him a fierce fire roaring somewhere down below.  A cry of\r\ndismay at his side told him that The Girl had scrambled up after him.\r\n\r\n\"The buckets,\" he jerked, and she sped back, tearing skin and garment\r\non the splintered doors, while he sought and found a length of rope.\r\n\r\nHis voice was steady again, though his hands shook with agitation, as\r\nhe slipped one end of the rope through the handle of the bucket and\r\nheld the two ends, while the bucket hung in the bight and so could be\r\nreleased instantly by loosing one end of the rope.  He filled both\r\nbuckets and with a hasty, \"Hand them down to me and fill again as I\r\nthrow them up,\" lowered himself into the hold.\r\n\r\nThe fire was burning fiercely against the after starboard bulkhead,\r\nwhich, as it happened, was the one nearest The Girl's sleeping-cabin.\r\nTheir lighter stores had been moved from their usual places and heaped\r\nabout it and were blazing furiously.  The bulkhead itself was on fire,\r\nbut had apparently only just caught.\r\n\r\nWulf flung his first bucketful at it, and it answered with a hiss like\r\na snarling curse, and showed a red-starred black blotch amid the\r\ncrawling yellow flames.\r\n\r\nHe tossed the empty bucket up on deck, and gave the bulkhead another\r\ndose with his second, and as he tossed that one up the first came\r\ndangling down filled again.\r\n\r\n\"Good girl!\" he shouted exultantly, to reassure her.  \"Plenty more!  We\r\nshall do it all right,\" and the full buckets came dangling down as fast\r\nas he could empty them.\r\n\r\nA score or so of bucketfuls ended it, and he climbed up, black with\r\nsmoke and streaked with steam and sweat, and very grateful to be in\r\nfresh air again.\r\n\r\nThe night was just thinning towards the dawn.  The Girl was sitting on\r\nthe coaming of the hatch in a state of collapse, her wet garment\r\nclinging clammily about her, her head in her hands, her slender figure\r\nshaken with convulsive sobs.  His anger boiled furiously at thought of\r\nthe malice that had planned her suffering--her possible death.  Love\r\nand pity swelled his heart for her.  She looked so utterly forlorn and\r\nbroken with the fight.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right, dear!\"--he could not help it, it slipped out in spite\r\nof him.  \"Come away down to the cabin.  You are shivering.  You are wet\r\nthrough and torn to pieces.  You have done splendidly, but it was an\r\nupsetting piece of business all round.  Come!\" and he put his arm under\r\nhers and drew her up.\r\n\r\nShe was so limp, however, that he had almost to carry her, and the feel\r\nof her unconscious sobs under his enfolding arm quickened his blood\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt the companion-doors he had to release her and go back for his axe.\r\nA stout plank had been cunningly bound against the doors by a rope tied\r\nround the companion.  His lips tightened sternly as he chopped the rope\r\nthrough and the plank fell to the deck.\r\n\r\nHe carried her gently down and laid her on his blankets, put some\r\nsticks on the fire and blew them into flame, and set on the kettle,\r\nwhich was fortunately full.  By the time he had made some coffee and\r\ndashed it with rum, she had recovered herself and was sitting up in the\r\nblankets with one drawn closely about her.\r\n\r\n\"That was an unnerving business,\" he said, as he handed her her cup.\r\n\"I'm afraid you had the worst of it.  You have a lot of scratches--and\r\nyour hands!  Oh, I am truly sorry----\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the rope,\" she said quietly, looking at the rasped rawness of\r\nthem.  \"It was all horrible.  How did it get on fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a deliberate attempt on the part of that wretch to make an end\r\nof us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"--and she gazed at him in blankest amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt.  He blocked our doors here with a plank and a rope, and\r\nthen started the fire down in the hold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is such wickedness possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a madman living chiefly on rum anything is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"He deserves to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Richly.  He deserves no mercy.  The thought of cutting him down with\r\nan axe was horrible.  But after this----\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no safety for us while he lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there isn't.\"\r\n\r\nSleep, he knew, would brace her unstrung nerves better than any thing\r\nelse, so, after bathing her hands in luke-warm water and anointing them\r\nwith some of the rendered pork fat she kept for her cooking, he induced\r\nher to go and lie down in her bunk.  Her other scratches she said she\r\nwould attend to when she could see them properly.\r\n\r\nThen he went on deck and drew up a bucket of water and washed off his\r\nown stains, and afterwards smoked many pipes as he pondered the\r\nunpleasantly weighty subject of Macro.  For that matters could go on\r\nlike this was out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nHe had cakes made and breakfast all ready long before she came out of\r\nher room, still visibly feeling the effects of the night's proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"I am stiff and sore all over,\" she said, lowering herself carefully to\r\nher seat on the floor.  \"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorer in mind than in body.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go over presently and tell him that now he must look out for\r\nhimself.  I will end him, the first chance I get, as I would a wild\r\nbeast.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will try to kill you on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't get the chance.  I'll see to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.  My heart would thump itself to pieces, waiting here all\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dangerous, and he has a vile tongue when it runs away with\r\nhim----\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care.  It is no more dangerous for me than for you.\r\nNo--no--no!\"--as he was about to argue the matter,--\"I cannot be left\r\nbehind,\" and nothing he could say could move her.\r\n\r\nThey saw no sign of life on the 'Jane and Mary,' not so much as a whiff\r\nof smoke from the companion-hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he fled when he saw his horrid scheme had failed,\" suggested\r\nThe Girl hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Not very likely, I'm afraid, but we can go across and see.  Won't you\r\nbe good now and take my advice----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be good, but I won't stop here alone.\"\r\n\r\nSo perforce he took her with him on the raft, and paddled quietly\r\nacross to the other ship.\r\n\r\nBut before they reached it she lifted a warning finger for him to stop\r\npaddling and listen.  And on their anxious ears there broke the\r\nstrangest medley of sounds conceivable, and chilled them in the\r\nhearing.  Wild bursts of laughter, cut short by yells of rage or sudden\r\nscreams, as of one in mortal fear,--hoarse shouts, torrents of oaths,\r\ndull flailing blows which sounded like fists on wood, and, through it\r\nall, the never-ceasing yells and screams.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone mad,\" panted The Girl, very white in the face, and looked\r\nat him with wide anxious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Delirium tremens,\"--with an understanding nod.  \"He could stand more\r\nthan most, but a man cannot live on rum alone,\" and he paddled slowly\r\ntowards the ship, his face knitted with doubts as to what he should do.\r\n\r\nHe was in two minds.  If he left the man to himself he would inevitably\r\ndie in the end, for he had unlimited liquor on board and would turn to\r\nit at once, like a hog to its mire, as soon as this bout ran its\r\ncourse.  On the other hand, every fragment of professional instinct in\r\nhim impelled him to the rescue.\r\n\r\nNever in his life had he withheld aid from one in extremity.  And yet\r\nit seemed monstrously absurd--to drag a man back from death solely for\r\nthe purpose of letting him do his best to kill you, the first chance\r\nthat offered.\r\n\r\nAnd he had more than himself to think for.  Suppose he saved this\r\nwretched man, and was worsted by him later on, what of The Girl?  She\r\nwould have reason enough to blame his pusillanimity, and he himself\r\nwould curse it with his last breath.\r\n\r\nBut was it fair fighting--to see your enemy in a hole and make no\r\neffort to save him?  Old-time Chivalry would never even have argued the\r\nmatter.  It would have helped the enemy out, handed him his weapons,\r\nand courteously awaited the renewal of the combat.  Ah--times were\r\nchanged....  And this man was compound of treachery and malice.\r\n\r\nThoughts such as these whirled through his brain before he had covered\r\nthe short space to the other ship.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here!\" he said to The Girl, and climbed through the well-known\r\nhole in the side,--and she followed him close in spite of his frowning\r\nobjection.  She had not come thus far to be out of the critical moment.\r\n\r\nHe ran down to the cabin, and went straight to the mate's door.  The\r\ndreadful sounds,--the shouts and yells and cries of fear, the furious\r\noaths, the wild thumping blows--filled the cabin with horrors.  Even in\r\nthat anxious moment The Girl was cognisant of a dreary, dirty,\r\nrepulsive look about it which had not been there before.  It was more\r\nlike the den of a wild beast than a living-room.  Some of the silken\r\nhangings were torn down, the one or two that were left hung by single\r\npegs.  It looked as though a maniac had chased his mad fancies round\r\nthe room and sought them behind the draperies.\r\n\r\nWulf, gripping his axe, opened the door into the passage, looked in,\r\nthen went in.  And The Girl drew near, to be at hand in case of need,\r\nand stood shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"Keep off!  Keep off, ye blank-eyed deevils!  ---- ---- ----!  Wi' your\r\nbloody beaks and tearing claws....  Keep off!  Keep off ---- ---- ----\r\nye!\" and the black fists, all bruised and bleeding, whirled and struck\r\nat the roof and sides of the bunk as he fought the birds the rum had\r\nbred in his brain.  Then, as they beat him down in a pestiferous crowd,\r\nhe gave a shrill scream and doubled himself over in a heap in his bunk,\r\nwith his hands clasped over his head to save it from their attacks.\r\nThen up again, shouting and fighting for dear life, and down flat again\r\nwith a scream, cowering in uttermost extremity of terror, while oaths\r\ndribbled out of him like water out of a spout.\r\n\r\nWulf came out and closed the door, and pushed her brusquely up the\r\nstairs to the deck.\r\n\r\n\"You should not have come down,\" he said sternly.  \"This is no place\r\nfor you,\" and then, seeing how white her face was, he added more\r\ngently, \"There is no danger--except to him.  He is fighting for his\r\nlife with the birds.  I can do nothing for him--except get rid of all\r\nhis rum.  He would turn to it the moment he comes round, and it is\r\npoison in his present state.\"\r\n\r\nHe went down again and rooted about everywhere, found two kegs in the\r\ncabin under the torn hangings, and another in Macro's room, with a\r\nspigot in it.  He carried them up on deck, staved in the heads with his\r\naxe, and emptied them overboard.  In the main-hold he found three more\r\nand did the same with them.\r\n\r\n\"When he gets through, his throat will be like a lime-kiln.  There is a\r\nbucket of water down there.  I will put in it the coffee we left from\r\nbreakfast and leave it in his cabin.  It will be the best thing for him\r\nif he will drink it.  But he'll be crazy for rum----  I'll take you\r\nback and get the coffee.  I'm sorry you came.\"\r\n\r\nThere was strong disapproval in his tone, but she did not resent it.\r\nAfter all, his thought was entirely for her in the matter.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure he won't fly at you?\" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"He's much too busy with the birds.  Besides, I shall not touch him or\r\nspeak to him.  It is best to leave him to himself.  We will leave some\r\nfood by him also,\" and she obediently let herself down before him on to\r\nthe raft.\r\n\r\n\"It does seem absurd----\" she began impulsively, as they joggled along.\r\n\r\n\"To keep him alive so that he may try again to kill us,\"--he nodded.\r\n\"I know.  But there it is, as the country-folk say.  However, he won't\r\nlive long if he keeps on at the rum.  As soon as he gets better he'll\r\ngo straight out to the pile to get more, unless he's too weak.  It's\r\nterribly wasteful work, what he's at, and no food to work on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether it's wrong or not, I cannot help wishing he would die,\" she\r\nsaid passionately.  \"It is too dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want his blood on my hands if I can help it,\" he said briefly.\r\nBut he felt as she did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\nAfter carrying supplies to the mate, he came back for her, and they\r\nwent ashore for fresh water, and he providently secured a couple more\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nThe Girl was very quiet, depressed, and very unlike her usual bright\r\nself.  But he was not surprised.  Her anxiety for the future was enough\r\nto account for it, and there was, besides, the reaction from the\r\nstrenuous upsetting through which they had just passed.\r\n\r\nEach morning he went across to see how the sick man was getting on, and\r\nshe let him go alone, but followed him with anxious eyes, and stood in\r\nthe bows watching till she saw him safely on his way back.\r\n\r\nOn the third day they took advantage of the enemy's enforced inactivity\r\nto go out to the pile and make good the losses caused by the fire.  And\r\nall the time they were away The Girl was in a state of dire anxiety\r\nlest he should have discovered their absence and got across and fired\r\ntheir ship.  But to her great relief it was there all right when they\r\ngot back, and showed no signs of visitation.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth morning Wulf found his patient sufficiently recovered to\r\nbe spoken to plainly as to the future, and he did not mince matters.\r\nWhile he spoke, the mate lay watching him through almost closed eyes,\r\njust one narrow line between the heavy lids catching the light from the\r\nport and imparting a singularly sinister look to the haggard face.  The\r\nveiled eyes watched him cautiously, charged with what?--suspicion?\r\nhatred? treachery?  All these, Wulf imagined.  But they gave no sign.\r\nThey were like the eyes of a snake, of a caged beast being rated by its\r\nkeeper.\r\n\r\n\"Your dastardly attempt on us failed,\" said Wulf, to the steely glint\r\nof the black soul behind the narrowed lids.  \"And now,--understand!\r\nYou are outside the pale.  Leave us alone and we leave you alone.\r\nInterfere further with us and I will kill you as I would a dangerous\r\nbeast.  Now you are warned, and your blood be on your own head.\"\r\n\r\nThe other made no sign.  The narrow gleam of the dark eyes out of the\r\nrigid impassivity of the dark face was more bodeful than a torrent of\r\ncurses.\r\n\r\nAs he left the ship, Wulf picked up and took with him the only two axes\r\nhe could find.  Magnanimity had its limits, but it was wasted here.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked The Girl anxiously, when he returned.\r\n\r\n\"He is almost himself again, but very much weakened of course.  I have\r\ngiven him final warning that if he molests us further I shall kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been simpler to let him die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simpler--yes, but I could not bring myself to it.  We'll fight him\r\nfair if fight we must.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather still kept dull and gray and heavy, with a reserve of\r\nmenace and malice in it akin to that of the mate.  The sky was veiled\r\nwith ever-hurrying clouds.  The sea was smooth, with something of\r\ntreachery in its sullen quietude, as though it were only biding its\r\ntime to break out again and do its worst.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, to their surprise, they saw Macro start out\r\nearly for the wreckage.  And Wulf, watching him grimly, said, \"He's\r\nafter his poison.  And now he'll probably drink himself to death.  It's\r\namazing the hold it takes on a man.  He won't trouble us much longer.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent the day ashore, but the vivacity and enjoyment of that other\r\nday were awanting.  Perhaps it was the cheerless weather,--the physical\r\nand mental strain of these later days,--the thought that their devil\r\nwas loosed again,--anyhow, a subtle sense of foreboding.  Whatever it\r\nwas it weighed upon their spirits, and a long tramp up the beach, in\r\nforlorn hope of meeting Mistress Seal again, did not succeed in raising\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, I wonder?\" said The Girl.  \"Something is going to happen,\r\nI know.  I have felt like this before, and always something dreadful\r\nhas followed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you never knew what, beforehand?  Perhaps you have the gift of\r\nprevision,--the second sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may have, but it doesn't go so far as to explain things.  I just\r\nfeel anxious for it to be over and done with.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's coming, whatever it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be extra careful for a time, till you are sure the trouble is\r\npast,\" he said, with a smile, but he felt the weight on his spirits as\r\nshe did.\r\n\r\nPhysically, however, their long tramp did them good, and they returned\r\nhome with famous appetites.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if he's back yet,\" said The Girl, as they were paddling to\r\nthe ship.  There was no doubt as to where her fears centred.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see the raft.  We'll see better from the deck,\" and when they\r\nhad climbed aboard they looked at once towards the spit and saw the\r\nmate's raft still lying there.  He was not back yet.\r\n\r\nThey ate, and rested, and until the darkness swallowed the spit, the\r\nraft still lay there.\r\n\r\n\"He's staying late,\" said Wulf.  \"Maybe he's broached a keg and taken\r\ntoo much.  It would be what I would expect from him under the\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHe patrolled the deck, after she had gone to bed, listening for the\r\nsound of the mate's oar.  But he heard nothing, and at last made up his\r\nmind that the fellow had probably waited too late and had made himself\r\nsnug out there for the night, though, for himself, the idea would not\r\nhave commended itself.  There was little danger, however, of his coming\r\nacross in the dark, so he went down and slept soundly at the foot of\r\nthe companion-steps.\r\n\r\nAll the next day they were on the look-out for him, but he did not come.\r\n\r\nWulf had told her of his idea that he had probably found means of\r\npassing the night out there, in which case he would no doubt put in\r\nanother long day rooting for treasure.  So that it was not until night\r\nhad fallen again, and the raft still lay waiting on the spit, that he\r\ndecided in his own mind that something was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go across to the pile in the morning to find out,\" he said, as\r\nthey sat by the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would very much sooner you stopped here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose it was all a trick on his part.  He may be hiding in the\r\nsandhills.  He would watch you go and then come out on me.  No,\" with a\r\nvery decided shake of the head, \"I go with you.\"\r\n\r\nSo, in the morning, they set off, walked along the spit to the western\r\npoint and waded and swam to the wreckage, keeping a keen look-out for\r\nfirst sight of the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Those hideous birds!\" panted The Girl, as the skirling, squabbling\r\ncrew swooped and hovered over the far end of the pile.\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep as far away from them as possible,\" and they crept up at a\r\ndistance, and he proceeded to make a raft, since a supply of further\r\nstores was needed to make good their losses by the fire.\r\n\r\nSo far they had come upon no signs of Macro.  From the top of the pile\r\nthey looked carefully all round, but beyond the usual smashed boxes and\r\ncases there was nothing to show that he had ever been there.\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth can he have got to?\" said Wulf.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he's fallen into the sea, or down into some crack,\" said The\r\nGirl, not unhopefully.\r\n\r\n\"It is always possible.  He might not recognise how the fever had\r\npulled him down.\"\r\n\r\nThey loaded their raft without any interference from the birds, beyond\r\nthe blood-curdling clamour of their angry disputations.  They were\r\nquite ready to go, but still the whereabouts of the mate was a mystery,\r\nand Wulf was loth to leave it at that.  He might be lying broken in\r\nsome crack.  If he had come to some sudden end it would be best to know\r\nit, if that were possible, so that their fears--on their own account as\r\nwell as his--might be at rest.  On the other hand it was quite\r\nimpossible to rake over the whole pile.  That would be a good month's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA grim idea shot suddenly into Wulf's mind, as he stood looking keenly\r\nround from the highest point he could clamber up to.  It came at sight\r\nof the birds whirling and clamouring round the end of the pile.\r\nSuppose ... oh,--horrible! ... yet it might very well be.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked The Girl anxiously, for his lips and face had\r\ntightened ominously at his thought.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, maybe.  I'm going over there to see....\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you see anything of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nHe poled the raft along the edge of the pile towards the hovering cloud\r\nof birds.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm going to swim along here and climb up.  I want to see what\r\nthey're at.  You will be quite safe here.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him with a startled look, fathoming his grim thought\r\ninstantly, and it blanched her face for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"They may turn on you,\" she jerked.\r\n\r\n\"They seem too busy.\"\r\n\r\nHe let himself down into the water and swam noiselessly along the side\r\nof the pile, and she stood watching anxiously.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the outskirts of the whirling cloud he found a sodden\r\ncrack, and drew himself in, and disappeared from her sight.  Her heart\r\nkicked till it felt like choking her.  Her face was strained, her eyes\r\nwide and fearful.  She felt horribly alone.\r\n\r\nInside his niche, Wulf climbed cautiously, the curdling clamour very\r\nclose.  Now and again a feathery fiend with eyes like glass and\r\nreddened beak swooped past his hiding-place, with a shrill cry of\r\nwarning to the rest at sight of him, or it might be of invitation.\r\n\r\nHe got his eyes above the top at last, in spite of pointed attentions\r\nfrom angry outsiders, scanned the spot where the shrieking crew centred\r\nmost thickly, and dreamed of what he got a glimpse of there for weeks\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n---- The remnants of what had been a man, all pecked and scratched and\r\ntorn to shreds,--white, clean-picked bones showing through fragments of\r\nhis clothing, myriads of squawking birds, of all shapes and sizes,\r\nclustered on it like bees on a comb, hustling and fighting one another\r\nwith shrill screams and thrashing wings and red beaks.  It was only\r\nwhen, through some unusually bitter struggle, the mass writhed and rose\r\nfor a moment, only to settle more closely the next, that he could see.\r\nNot far from the body was a broached keg which the birds had overturned\r\nin their strife.  It explained everything to him.\r\n\r\nHe dropped back down his cleft, sick at the sight, grateful for the\r\nclean feel of the water.  He plunged his head under and spat out the\r\nfeeling of it all.  Then he made his way quietly back to The Girl, and\r\nshe had no need to ask what he had found.  He nodded, and climbed up on\r\nto the raft and pushed quickly away.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure he is dead?\" she asked, after a time.\r\n\r\n\"Horribly dead,\" and told her no more till later, and then not very\r\nmuch.  \"It is strange to think of it all,\" he said, in conclusion.  \"He\r\nalways feared the birds.  In his delirium it was the birds he was\r\nfighting.  And the birds got him at last.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner of his death shocked and horrified them.  But the knowledge\r\nthat the menace of him had passed out of their lives was untellable\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nLOVE IN A MIST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mate's death on The Girl's spirits was visible at\r\nonce.  The cloud had lifted from her face before they got fairly home.\r\nHer eyes shone untroubled, though a look of horror and disgust came\r\ninto them whenever they rested on the swirling gray cloud behind them.\r\nIn her very movements Wulf noticed a new and gracious freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd his judgment did her no injustice in the matter, nor imputed it, in\r\nany slightest degree, to mere exultation over a fallen enemy.  For he\r\nknew to the full in what terror of the dead man she had lived, and how\r\nthe fear of him, both for herself and himself, had lain like a weight\r\non her soul and darkened all her outlook.\r\n\r\nHe felt as she did about it.  He could not regret the fact of the man's\r\ndeath, but the manner of it gave him poignant distress.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their hard work they had neither of them much appetite for\r\nfood that night.  They turned in early and slept as they had not slept\r\nfor long, without fear and without strain.  The darkness was no longer\r\npregnant with ungaugeable terrors.  The dawn was like the beginning of\r\na new life to them.\r\n\r\nWulf, indeed, saw again that night, and many a night thereafter, the\r\nhorror of the clustering birds and that over which they bristled and\r\nfought.  But he woke each time to the immeasurable relief of the man's\r\ndeath.  That had been essential to their own safety, but he thanked God\r\nwith his whole heart that it had not been by his hand that he had had\r\nto die.  For that he never could be sufficiently grateful.  He had\r\nplayed him fair and more than fair.  He was dead, and their consciences\r\nand their hearts were alike at rest.\r\n\r\nThey woke next morning to the close folding of the mist, and he had to\r\nset to work at once making good the broken companion-doors to keep it\r\nout of the cabin as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBeing but a poor carpenter, the only way he could do this was by\r\nnailing a blanket to the top of the hatch and pegging it down tightly\r\nto the top step.  But he foresaw that the next gale would blow his\r\nstop-gap to pieces and destroy their comfort below.  So did the dead\r\nman's deeds live after him, and it was not the only one.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting at their mid-day meal, when the thick silence of the\r\nmist outside was rent by a shrill frightened scream right above their\r\nheads, and almost simultaneous with it a heavy thump, and then, on the\r\ndeck above them, blows and screams and the sound of some large body\r\ntumbling to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe Girl sprang up with a white face and scared eyes and a word of\r\ndismay.  Wulf picked up his axe and burst through his carefully\r\nadjusted blanket at the top of the companion.  Then she heard the\r\nchop-chop of his axe on the deck, and the fall of something into the\r\nwater, and he came down laughing at the start it had given him also.\r\n\r\n\"It was the biggest bird I ever saw,\" he said.  \"It had banged itself\r\nagainst the mast, I think, and was flopping all over the place.  I\r\nchopped its head off and pitched it overboard.  It must have measured\r\nsix feet at least from tip to tip of its wings.  It gave you a start.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just thinking of that man and how different everything was now\r\nhe is gone, and then that horrid scream----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was enough to make anyone jump.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me for a moment that it was his spirit come back to\r\ntrouble us still, as he had done while he lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't come.  Unless it's got inside a bird, as he always said.  You\r\nmust try to forget all about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy.  But, whether it is wicked of me or not, I thank God\r\nhe is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I thank God that he did not die by my hand.  I shall never cease\r\nto be thankful for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall never be able to build a boat now,\" she said presently,\r\nfollowing out the natural train of her thought.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\"--with a doleful shake of the head.  \"Unless you have\r\nhad any experience in such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so we may have to pass the rest of our lives here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to consider how very much worse off we might be.  For\r\nmyself....  Besides, one never knows.  Some unexpected chance may turn\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can bear to think of living on and on and on here till--the\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can bear to think of it very much better than I could a short time\r\nago....  No cloud is black on both sides.  Look on the bright side.\r\nEither of us might have been here alone.  That would have been\r\nterrible----\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"But instead of that we are two, we have comfortable shelter, the\r\nmighty blessing of fire, food enough to last us as long as we live----\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like that man in the Bible--the man who had his barns full,\r\nall he wanted to eat and drink, and so he made merry.  And that night\r\nhe died, if I remember rightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not boasting.  We arrived here lacking everything, and\r\neverything has been provided for us.  We have reason to be grateful.\r\nEven Macro was necessary.  He showed us how to turn the wreck-pile to\r\naccount.  If I had come ashore alone I doubt if I would ever have gone\r\nout to it again.  It did not attract me....  And--he found you and\r\nbrought you ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was the beginning of the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--the beginning of better things.  We will hope the end is a long\r\nway off yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder ... and what it will be,\" said she thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nAnd he wondered if in her heart there was any sweet white seed of hope\r\nakin to that which was striking its roots so deeply in his own,--and if\r\nnot, if it might be possible to plant it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\nThis new life, free from the shadow of perpetual menace, was full of\r\nrare and delicate charm for both of them, differing only in quality and\r\ndegree according to that wherewith Nature had endowed them.\r\n\r\nOne root-thought was inevitable to both their minds--that here were\r\nthey two, cut off from the rest of the world, probably for the term of\r\ntheir natural lives.  Here, as far as they could foresee, they two must\r\nlive, alone,--together; and here, in the end, they must die; their\r\nliving and their dying alike unseen and unknown except by their Maker.\r\n\r\nIn his heart the white seed of the greater hope was striking deep and\r\nstrong, filling his whole being with a new and exquisite delight before\r\neven it had had time to shoot and flower.\r\n\r\nExile for life on that barren strip of sand, which with Macro as sole\r\nfellow-sufferer would have been barely tolerable, assumed a very\r\ndifferent aspect with Avice Drummond as his companion; and with her as\r\nsole companion, an aspect of supremest joy and expectation.  It was no\r\nlonger a thing to look forward to with foreboding, or at best with dull\r\nand hopeless acquiescence in the inevitable.  The shadow had suddenly\r\nlifted.  The desert had suddenly blossomed like the rose.  The future\r\nsmiled shyly as does the dawn with promise of the day.\r\n\r\nBut this new great hope, and the sense of it all in him, were of so\r\nfine and delicate a nature that he hardly dared to whisper it even in\r\nhis inmost heart, lest she should see some sign of it and take fright,\r\nand all his hope vanish like smoke in a gale.\r\n\r\nShe was so fair and sweet, so charming and gracious, so pre-eminently\r\nand perfectly desirable.  It was highest and keenest delight--delight\r\nso keen that at times it had in it the elements of pain--simply to\r\nwatch the play of her face, so eloquently responsive to the quick\r\nemotional soul within,--the large dark eyes so clear and frank, so\r\nunreservedly trustful of him.\r\n\r\nHe would sooner die than forfeit one iota of the honour her faith\r\nconferred on him.  And that great springing hope of his must be\r\ncarefully covered and concealed, until such time as he should discover\r\nin her eyes the outlook of a hope responsive.\r\n\r\nIt would come.  It would come, he said to himself--in time--when she\r\nshould have come to know him still better and to trust him still more\r\nfully--to the uttermost.\r\n\r\nFor the ultimate goal of his desire was, in the manner of its possible\r\nattainment at all events, somewhat nebulous to him, though it set the\r\nwhole distant future ablaze with rosy fires.  In the nature of things,\r\ncircumstanced as they were, such ultimate attainment, if ever it were\r\nreached, could be reached only by the treading of unusual ways.  And to\r\nrequire that of any girl--and especially of a girl such as this,\r\nhigh-born, intelligent beyond most, and deeply versed in the great\r\nworld's ways--was asking of her more than any true man, truly loving,\r\ncould bring himself to ask,--unless to both their hearts no other thing\r\nwere possible,--unless the barrier of Circumstance left no other\r\npossible hope or way.\r\n\r\nAnd for the proving of that, Time held the keys and must have his say.\r\n\r\nHe wondered often, and with keenest anxiety, if her heart could\r\npossibly have come through all the strange experiences of her previous\r\nlife unchallenged, unassailed, unwon.  Seeing that she was what she was\r\nit seemed to him almost impossible.\r\n\r\nShe was to him so compact of goodness and beauty, so fashioned to\r\nbewitch, that he could not imagine any man impervious to her grace and\r\ncharm.  What manner of men could they be who, consorting with her daily\r\nand on terms of equality, had failed to capture a heart so made for\r\nloving?\r\n\r\nHe recalled in minutest detail all she had told him of her past life\r\nand friends and acquaintances, figured them all in his mind, weighed\r\nthem jealously in the scales of his own devotion, and could not\r\ndiscover one trace of emotion towards one or another, but rather of\r\naversion towards all.\r\n\r\nAgain and again she had expressed the joy she had felt at the prospect\r\nof her escape to a freer and larger life.  It was, of course, not\r\nimpossible that that feeling might but hide some heart-breaking\r\ndisappointment of the earlier times.  But he did not think so.  She was\r\nto him truth personified, though still a woman.  He believed in her\r\nabsolutely, as a man should in the woman who holds his heart.  So far\r\nas assurance could go,--without the definite question which he longed\r\nto put but did not yet dare, lest the hopeful anxiety of his present\r\nstate should be turned to hopeless regret,--he felt fairly safe in\r\nbuilding on a rosy future.\r\n\r\nHow she regarded himself he could not surely say.  But she trusted him\r\nand that was a good foundation for his building.\r\n\r\nAnd she?  Well, that is our story!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\nThat thick white bank of mist clung to them for the best part of a\r\nweek.  But, freed from all fear of treacherous assault, it troubled\r\nthem little.\r\n\r\nOnce they had to go ashore for water, but got back safely by means of\r\ntheir guiding-line, and as they pushed through the fog they recalled\r\nthat former time, when the mate's grim figure fashioned itself suddenly\r\nout of the clammy whiteness and brought them near to a disastrous end.\r\n\r\nFor the rest they had no scarcity.  The fish bit as well in the fog as\r\nin the clear, and they had pork and flour for weeks to come.\r\n\r\nIn their narrow confinement to the ship, their intimacy and knowledge\r\nof one another grew with the days.  She talked well, and he was an\r\nexcellent listener, and led her on and on to tell him of the past and\r\nall that had interested her in it, and mused on all she said, and\r\nsought in it enlightenment as to her heart's freedom or otherwise.\r\n\r\nOnce, when she had been roving at length through her earlier days, she\r\nbroke off suddenly with, \"But, mon Dieu, I am doing all the talking!\r\nNow, tell me of yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have so little to tell compared with you.  Shall I tell you of\r\nschool-days--of college--of the hospitals--of my patients and their\r\nailments?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me why you left it all to seek the new life.\"\r\n\r\n\"For very much the same reason as you did, I imagine.  I was living in\r\na groove and I wanted something wider and larger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now you are sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So very sorry that if I had the chance again, and knew beforehand all\r\nthat was to come, I would jump at it like the fish to our hooks,\" as he\r\nhauled one aboard and knocked it an the head.  \"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye--es, I think I would have come also.  Not perhaps if I had known I\r\nwould have to float about on that mast.  It was so terribly\r\ncold,\"--with a shiver.  \"For the rest, I have no regrets, but it is\r\nperhaps too soon to say.  In ten years hence I may have come to be\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--ten years hence!\" he said musingly.  \"Many things may happen in\r\nten years.  There's a fish on your hook,\" and she hauled it in and let\r\nhim dispose of it.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at supper that night the blanket which supplied the place\r\nof companion-doors began to flap, and, going up to look, he found the\r\nmist whirling away before a gusty breeze.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to blow,\" he told her, \"and when it's blown itself out we\r\nmay have a spell of fine weather again,\" and he proceeded to block the\r\nopening with some planks he had chipped to size as well as he could\r\nwith his axe.\r\n\r\nThe wind was rising rapidly, and before they turned in for the night\r\nthe birds had all come in and were whirling and screaming round the\r\nship, and lighting on it as was their custom in bad weather.  But they\r\nhad grown accustomed to their clamour and both slept soundly.\r\n\r\nWulf was shaken back to life in the dead of the early morning by a\r\nrestive jerk of the ship at her rusty anchor-chain, followed by a\r\nmomentary sense of the unusual.  And while he lay sleepily considering\r\nthe matter, his bunk heeled slowly over--over--over, and rolled him\r\nright against the side of the ship.  The sound of a heavy fall,\r\nsomewhere beyond, made him scramble out very wide awake, full of\r\nwonder, but dimly perceptive of what must have happened.  The rusty\r\nchain had evidently parted, the ship had drifted ashore broadside on,\r\nand the force of the wind had caused her to heel over.  The sound he\r\nhad heard was, he feared, of Miss Drummond's falling out of her bunk.\r\n\r\nHe flung on some clothes and clawed his way out to the cabin.  The\r\nfloor of it was tilted up at such an angle that he had to claw his way\r\nup by the side wall as best he could.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" he cried, outside The Girl's door.\r\n\r\n\"Bruised a bit.  Whatever has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"The cable has parted and we're ashore on our beam-ends.  No danger, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be out in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nThen he became aware of a smell of burning, and found that the sand\r\nhearth with its core of fire had slid downhill and was smouldering\r\namong the silken draperies, which were beginning to break into flame.\r\n\r\nHe crawled back and tore them down and bunched them tightly together,\r\nthen scooped up handfuls of sand and smothered every cinder he could\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nMiss Drummond's door opened just as he had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Stop where you are,\" he cried.  \"I'll come up for you.  Everything's\r\non the slope.  I think we'd better sit on the floor and let ourselves\r\ndown by degrees.\"\r\n\r\nOutside, the wild screaming of the birds mingled eerily with the rush\r\nand howl of the gale.  It was still quite dark.  He could not see her,\r\nbut groped about till he felt her blankets, then found her hand and\r\neased her carefully down the slope, and they crouched side by side in\r\nthe angle made by the floor and the side of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Will she go down?\" she asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no.  No fear of that.  We're aground.  But whether she'll ever\r\ncome straight again I don't know.  Did it pitch you out of your bunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I woke with a crash on the floor, and could not imagine what had\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you didn't break yourself.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment and then said, \"I'm afraid I did break\r\nsomething, but I couldn't----\"\r\n\r\n\"Broke something?  What?\" he asked hastily.\r\n\r\n\"My arm feels numb and queer.  I fell on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me feel it,\" and, kneeling in front of her, he groped till he\r\nfound it, and felt it with anxious gentle fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, it's broken!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it.  You see\"----\r\n\r\n\"Your right arm too!  Don't move it!\"\r\n\r\nHe groped about for another length of the silken hangings, tore it\r\ndown, and wound it tightly round her arm.  \"That will keep it in\r\nplace,\" he said.  \"The moment it is light I will make splints and set\r\nit properly.  I am truly sorry you should have suffered so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better me than you.  It might have been worse.  What made that chain\r\nbreak, I wonder?  We've had worse storms than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was bound to give sooner or later.  It was very old and rusted.\r\nIts time came, I suppose, and it went.  Sure you have no other damages?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only bumps and bruises.  I felt as if the side of my face were crushed\r\nin, but I don't think it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you in the top bunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I liked to look out of the window in the mornings.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good big fall to take unawares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I fell out like a sack and woke on the floor.  What shall we do\r\nif she doesn't come right side up again?  We can't live all upside down\r\nlike this.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's always the other ship to fall back on ... unless her chain's\r\nbroken too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like our own much the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not if she stops like this....  And even if she straightened up\r\nshe would heel over again in the next gale.  I'm afraid we'll have to\r\nmove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always see that man's black face about the cabin, glaring at\r\nme as he used to do as if he wanted to eat me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we have to go we'll give it a good cleaning, and fresh hangings,\r\nand make it to your taste.\"\r\n\r\nSo they chatted quietly, while the gale and the birds shrieked in\r\nchorus outside, and the waves of the lake thumped scornfully on the\r\nexposed bottom of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could see, he rooted about for axe and knife, and chopped\r\nup a board and made a set of splints for her arm.  And, though he\r\ngrieved for the pain she must have suffered, he could not but feel a\r\nhuge enjoyment in ministering to her.\r\n\r\nThe mere touch of her firm white flesh was a rare delight and made his\r\nfingers tingle.  He did his best to think of her only as a patient, but\r\nfound it impossible.  She was so very much more to him than any\r\nordinary patient ever had been or could be.\r\n\r\nBut for her suffering, he felt inclined to bless the breaking of the\r\nrusty cable.  It brought them closer than ever before.  It threw her\r\nmore than ever on to his care.  With her right arm prisoner she would\r\nbe able to do but little for herself.  She had not been able to dress\r\nherself properly, but had simply swathed a blanket about her night\r\nattire, leaving the broken arm free.  But even so, her natural taste\r\nand capability had so arranged it, even in the darkness and moment of\r\ndanger, that she looked like a Greek goddess, he said to himself, with\r\none arm in a sling.  One can make allowances for him.\r\n\r\nAs the light grew stronger he saw, to his distress, that her face had\r\nalso suffered sorely in her fall.  The whole right side was badly\r\nbruised and discoloured.\r\n\r\n\"Is it very bad?\" she asked, as she saw him looking at it.  \"It feels\r\nsore and my head hums like a bee-hive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got a bad bump there.  I will get some salt water and bathe it.\r\nOur fresh will all be gone in the upset, but I'll sling a bucket under\r\nthe scupper-hole and we'll have enough for some coffee presently.  When\r\nyou've had some breakfast you will go and lie down in my bunk.  If you\r\ncould get a good sleep it would be the very best thing for you.  Does\r\nthe arm hurt much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as it did, but I don't think I can sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will when you lie down.  You've had a bad shaking up.  I'm truly\r\nsorry that all the penalties have fallen on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing you didn't break yourself too.  Suppose we'd broken\r\nall our arms!\" and she laughed a wry little laugh.\r\n\r\nHe crawled up the slope, and wormed himself through his barricade, and\r\ncame back presently with a bucketful of water, found a piece of soft\r\nlinen and insisted on bathing her face, under plea that she would\r\njoggle the broken arm if she tried to do it herself.\r\n\r\nThen he scraped together at the foot of the slope sand enough for a\r\nsmall hearth, split some wood and kindled a fire, but found it\r\nnecessary to open one of the ports to leeward to let out the smoke.\r\nWhen he did so he found the water within a foot of it and could only\r\nhope they would heel over no more.  He proceeded to make cakes and\r\ncoffee, and then fried some salt pork, and anointed the bruised face\r\nwith the fat of it, and she found it soothing.\r\n\r\nWhen he had cut up her meat for her, and she had managed to eat a\r\nlittle, he helped her into his bunk, the upper one because it was\r\nairier and allowed more head-room, and covered her with blankets and\r\ntold her to go to sleep.  And then, since there was nothing more to be\r\ndone, he crawled up the slope and got her blankets off the floor of her\r\nroom, and made up a bed for himself in the angle at the foot of the\r\nslope.  He lay for a time listening to the gale, and pondering the\r\npossibility of its doing them any further damage, and fell asleep with\r\nthe matter still unsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was close on mid-day, unless his appetite misled him.\r\nHe prepared another meal and then tapped gently on The Girl's door.\r\nReceiving no answer he peeped into the dim little room and found her\r\nstill sleeping soundly, her head in the crook of her left arm, from\r\nwhich the wide sleeve of her night-dress had slipped down,--as fair a\r\npicture as man could wish to look upon, in spite of her bruised face\r\nand broken arm.\r\n\r\nHe stood watching her for a moment with bated breath, and recalled that\r\nfirst morning when she came ashore and he had doubted if he could\r\nrecover her; and he thanked God again for the dogged obstinacy which\r\nwould not let him accept defeat so long as smallest hope remained.\r\n\r\nShe moved, opened her heavy eyes, and lay quietly looking at him, just\r\nas she had done that other time, and for a brief space there was no\r\nmore recognition in them than there had been then.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?  Who are you?\" she asked, and he suffered a momentary\r\nshock.  But for reply he laid his cool strong hand--rougher than it\r\nused to be, but vitally sensitive to the feel of her--on the broad\r\nwhite forehead, and found it hot and throbbing.  That did not greatly\r\nsurprise him.  There was sure to be a certain feverishness after such\r\nan experience.  And he would have given much for five minutes' root\r\nround his old dispensary.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing,--nothing but common sense, and his professional\r\nknowledge, and Nature's simplest remedies.  He went out quietly and got\r\ncold water and soft linen, and bathed the throbbing forehead and then\r\nlaid the wet bandage on it.\r\n\r\n\"That is nice,\" she said softly.  \"What a trouble I am to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, frightful!\" he smiled, as he changed the cloth for a fresh one.\r\n\"You see how I resent it.  Has the arm been hurting?\"\r\n\r\n\"It hurts at times, but my head is the worst, and I feel bruised all\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no more breakages?\" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, just bruised and stiff and sore.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a second.  She was so very much more to him than\r\nsimply a patient.\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me remind you that I am a doctor?  The very best cure for\r\nall that is gentle rubbing.  If you will allow me I will undertake to\r\nreduce the pains by one half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then please do, Doctor, for I ache in every bone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drew off all her blankets but one, and through it proceeded to\r\nmassage the aching limbs, and had never in his life found greater\r\nenjoyment in his work.  He even ventured to treat the throbbing head in\r\nthe same way, drawing his fingers soothingly over the white forehead\r\nand up into the masses of her hair.\r\n\r\n\"There is virtue in your fingers,\" she murmured drowsily, and before he\r\nhad done she was sleeping soundly again.  Then he laid another wet\r\ncloth on her forehead and left Nature to do her share in the good work.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that she had little appetite for the next few days.\r\nThe cakes he made for her, and water, scrupulously boiled and cooled\r\nand flavoured with coffee, amply satisfied her; and he, himself lived\r\non pork, fish and fresh meat being unobtainable.\r\n\r\nFor four days the gale bellowed round them, but being to leeward, and\r\nprotected somewhat by the heeling of the ship, they felt it less than\r\nif they had been on an even keel, and it never kept The Girl from\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nMuch of that time Wulf spent in an endeavour to obtain salt from sea\r\nwater, the lack of it being one of their greatest deprivations.  As the\r\nresult of many boilings and the careful scraping up of the slight\r\nencrustations on his pans, he managed to get a little, and exultantly\r\nlet The Girl taste it as a great treat; but it was a long and slow\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe default of her right arm made her very dependent on him in many\r\nlittle ways, but never was service more tactfully rendered or more\r\ndelighted in by the servitor.  And every service, so rendered and\r\naccepted, made for increased knowledge on both sides, and so for closer\r\nintimacy.\r\n\r\nNever, in all her contact with the greater world, had she met any man\r\nin whom she felt such implicit confidence as in this man.  Never, since\r\nthat first time her wondering eyes met his, when his strenuous\r\nexertions had dragged her back from the dead, had he by word or deed or\r\nlook, raised one shadow of fear or mistrust in her mind.  In\r\neverything, to the extremest point of death itself, he had proved\r\nhimself a simple, brave, and honest gentleman.\r\n\r\nAnd as she lay there helpless, with the gale howling outside and the\r\nbroken waves of the lake clop-clopping in the strakes under her ear,\r\nshe had much time to think of him and all he had done and was doing for\r\nher, and all her thought was warm and grateful.\r\n\r\n\"I am a dreadful burden to you,\" she would say.  \"And you are very very\r\ngood to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would answer her, with the smile she liked to provoke, \"But for\r\nyour suffering in the matter I would tell you how grateful I am to that\r\nrotten chain for giving me the opportunity.  I count it a privilege as\r\nwell as a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had left her, she would think at times how it might have\r\nbeen with her if it were not this man but the other with whom she had\r\nbeen left alone.  And she would shiver at the thought, and then\r\nremember that if the other had been alone she would not have been\r\nthere, for he could never have drawn her back from the dead as this one\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nAnd she thought also at times of their fight with the other in the fog,\r\nand followed that idea up and shivered still more.  For if the mate had\r\nkilled this man it would indeed have gone hard with her.  Ay, she had\r\nmuch to be thankful for, and thankful she was.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the future....  It was all vague and dim, as the future\r\nalways must be, but she had no fear of it, because she trusted this man\r\nso perfectly.\r\n\r\nVague and dim it might be, but it was shot with rosy gleams.\r\n\r\nWhatever he might ask of her she would hold it right because he asked\r\nit.  She had found him worthy.  She would trust him completely, ask\r\nwhat he might.  Yes, ... ask ... what ... he ... might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\n\"The sun's coming out,\" was his cheerful announcement, one morning when\r\nhe came in with her breakfast.  \"And here's some fish for you at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sight of it makes me hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the best news you've given me for four days.  There's some salt\r\nfor you in payment,\" he said, with full pride of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\"Salt is a great treat.  Have you left any for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've got some.  I'm going to set up a regular salt factory as soon\r\nas you're about again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to get up and go on deck when I've had breakfast.  Surely\r\nthe ship is not so tilted as it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so bad, but I'm afraid it will never come quite right side\r\nup again.  It's hard and fast on the shore at present.  I could wade\r\nacross.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must see it.  I will get up as soon as I have had my breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you manage?\" he asked doubtfully.  \"You must keep that arm quiet,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try anyway.  If I get stuck I will call,\" and in due course she\r\ncalled, and he found that she had managed to get her blankets round\r\nher, and that as gracefully as ever in some marvellous fashion, but she\r\nhad doubted her power of getting out of the bunk in its lopsided state\r\nwithout his help.\r\n\r\nHe stepped up on to the lower bunk, and worked his arms under her.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if you wouldn't mind steadying yourself with your usable hand on\r\nmy shoulder--so!  There you are!\" and he lifted her gently to her feet\r\non the floor.  \"Now, hang on to my arm....  But your shoes?--you had\r\nbetter have them on.  In your own room of course.  Wait and I'll get\r\nthem,\" and he climbed up and got them, and put them on and tied them\r\nfor her.  \"I've pegged some slats across the slope for better\r\nfoot-hold.  You can't slip,\" and he got her safely out on to the deck.\r\n\r\n\"It is delightful to be in fresh air again,\" she said, as she drank it\r\nin.  \"I wish the good weather would last for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll hope for a good long spell anyhow.  Doesn't it feel odd to be so\r\nclose to the shore?  We'll have rabbit for dinner.  You must almost\r\nhave forgotten what it tastes like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can still just remember,\" she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get up some blankets and tuck you into this corner, and then I'll\r\ngo and get some and some fresh water.  Our raft's blown ashore and the\r\nother one also.  I shall have to wade.\"\r\n\r\nHe made her comfortable in the corner, got his buckets and a stick, and\r\ndropped over the side.\r\n\r\nShe lay watching him as he waded ashore, saw him stop for a moment to\r\nexamine the raft, and then, with a wave of the hand, he set off for the\r\npools, swinging his buckets jauntily.\r\n\r\nWere there many such men in the world, she wondered, and why had she\r\nnever met any of them before?  The men she had met were so very\r\ndifferent.  They were as a rule so elusive and evasive that you never\r\nquite knew what they were driving at ... except that it was certain to\r\nbe for their own satisfaction and advantage ... and that unless you\r\nwere always on your guard it was likely to turn out ill for you ... a\r\nqueer world, and life was a puzzle past comprehending.....\r\n\r\nShe was glad to be out of it ... even on this sandbank....  Life was\r\nsweeter here, and certainly very much simpler....  Well, perhaps a\r\nlittle too severely simple in some respects....  But one could not have\r\neverything....  Thank God, again, that it was this man who was with her\r\nand not that other!...\r\n\r\nShe saw him coming at last with his full buckets, and presently made\r\nout a couple of rabbits hanging round his neck.\r\n\r\n\"The birds are having a great time out yonder,\" he called to her.\r\n\"Lots of new wreckage, I expect, and they've been fasting.  I must get\r\nacross as soon as I can and see if the storm has brought anything for\r\nus.  One never knows,\"--he had come alongside, and lifted the buckets\r\nand tossed the rabbits on to the deck.  \"I'll fasten the raft to the\r\nchain there\"--and he hauled himself along on it to the bows.\r\n\r\nShe heard a smothered exclamation, and presently he climbed up and came\r\nalong the deck with something in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that?\" and he handed her the link of the rusty\r\ncable which had given way and let them drift ashore.\r\n\r\nShe turned it over in her fingers.  Just where it had opened, the metal\r\nglinted in the sunshine, and just above that there was a patch that\r\nlooked like grease.  She shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see?--it's been filed enough to weaken it, and there was\r\ngrease on the file.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think----\" with a shocked look.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly.  No one else could have done it.  But what his idea was,\r\nI can't make out.  Just to make trouble, I suppose.  Of course if the\r\nwind had come the other way, as it has done once or twice, we might\r\nhave blown right down the lake.  It was a mean trick.  I wonder when he\r\ndid it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more thankful than ever that he's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I....  I've been thinking we'd better move across there as soon\r\nas possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must we?  I have grown so fond of this old ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't live on the slope like this.  Besides, if a gale did come\r\nthe opposite way we might have trouble.  I'll go over presently and\r\nbegin cleaning.  When I've finished you'll find it much more\r\ncomfortable than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always like this the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking as I went over to the pools that it might not be a bad\r\nidea to build some kind of a house on shore.  I can get timber enough\r\nfor a hundred.  You see, we don't quite know what winter may be like in\r\nthis place, but it's pretty sure to be a time of storms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you build a house?\"\r\n\r\n\"One never knows what one can do till one tries.  This is a great place\r\nfor bringing out one's unknown faculties.  I've done a good many things\r\nI never expected to do, since I came here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be a good plan.  Can't it wait till I can help?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see.  We must do like the ants and squirrels--work hard while\r\nit's fine and get in our supplies for the winter.  We are mighty\r\nfortunate to have such a store to draw upon.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent all the rest of the day slaving like a charwoman on the 'Jane\r\nand Mary,' and The Girl lay in her nest watching him, as he went up and\r\ndown, now flinging rubbish overboard, then hauling up buckets of water,\r\nand sluicing and mopping, with every now and again a cheery wave of\r\nhand or mop in her direction, and long periods below devoted, she did\r\nnot doubt, to the doing of more of those things which he had never\r\ndone, or expected to do, until he came there.  And her heart was very\r\nwarm to him, knowing that it was not for his own comfort but for hers\r\nthat all these great labours were toward.\r\n\r\nShe saw him busy on deck, bending and bobbing up and down, and once she\r\ncaught the gleam of vivid colours, and wondered what he was at.  He was\r\na long time below after that, and then he went ashore for a load of\r\nsand, and when it was getting dark she suddenly caught glimpse of his\r\nhead in the water as he wound up the day's work with a very necessary\r\nswim.\r\n\r\nHe came across on the raft all aglow, but visibly tired and hungry, and\r\ngreeted her with a cheery, \"I think you'll find it all to your liking.\r\nI've swabbed away every trace of the former tenants and everything is\r\nfresh and new.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could have helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you did, by sitting quietly here and getting better, to say\r\nnothing of a wave of the hand now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was not doing much when you were working like a----\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a nigger.  I looked like one too till I'd had that swim.  Now\r\nI'll get supper ready, and tomorrow we'll flit, and you'll be able to\r\nwalk about on an even keel without any danger of falling.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped her down to the cabin and their very close quarters at the\r\nbottom of the slope, and set to work preparing their evening meal.  And\r\nthe more incongruous his occupations and the more menial his tasks, the\r\nmore The Girl's heart warmed towards him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as soon as they had eaten, he got the raft round to the\r\nlower side of the ship, ruthlessly hacked out a section of the bulwarks\r\nso that she could step down with the smallest possible exertion, and\r\ntook her across to the new house.\r\n\r\nGetting her on board without shock to the broken arm was not so easy.\r\nHe moored the raft, stem and stern, and braced it tight so that it\r\ncould not move.  Then he built on it a pyramid of three empty boxes,\r\nforming steps up which she could climb high enough to grip his strong\r\nhand teaching down through the gap in the side and so be drawn safely\r\nup on to the deck, which he had swabbed with sand and water till it was\r\ncleaner than it had been for years.\r\n\r\n\"It is nice to be able to walk on the flat of one's feet again,\" she\r\nsaid, and he led her down below to a cabin gorgeous as an Eastern room\r\nwith drapings of amber silk and blue, and every bit of woodwork scoured\r\nas clean as elbow-grease could make it.\r\n\r\n\"It is delightful,\" she said fervidly.  \"How you must have slaved at\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how I enjoyed doing it!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a new sand hearth, nicely banked up between planks pegged\r\nupright on the floor, and a pile of wood on it ready for lighting.  He\r\nlit a match with his flint and steel, and handed it to her as before,\r\nso that she might start the first fire in the new home.\r\n\r\n\"You will take your old room,\" he said.  \"Then if we should topple over\r\nagain you won't be able to fall out of your bunk.  Now I'll go back and\r\nbring over all our belongings.  I made a complete clearance here,\r\nexcept some of the stores which we can use,\" and before mid-day he had\r\neverything transferred and stowed away.\r\n\r\nHe spent most of the afternoon weaving in and out of their rusty cable\r\nlengths of the least-rotten rope he could lay hands on, in order to\r\nstrengthen it and stop its chafing as much as possible.  But below\r\nwater he could not go beyond a foot or two, and the lower links he had\r\nto leave to Providence.\r\n\r\nAs he worked, The Girl paced the deck, rejoicing in its horizontality,\r\nand came each time to lean over the bows and watch him and say a lively\r\nword or two.  And, if any had been there to see, it would have been\r\ndifficult to believe that two such cheerful people were, to the very\r\nbest of their belief, condemned by an inscrutable fate to imprisonment\r\nfor life on this lonely sandbank,--to a confinement as solitary in some\r\nrespects, and in the prospect of escape as hopeless, as that of the\r\nBastille itself.\r\n\r\nBut--they were together; and Adam and Eve, cast out of the Garden,\r\ncould still make a home in the wilderness and turn the joys that were\r\nleft them to fullest account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\nHe was up betimes next morning, and had fish for their breakfast before\r\nshe came out of her room, and, moreover, had made cakes and full\r\nprovision for all her needs during the day.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go out there at once,\" he said.  \"You will not mind being\r\nleft?  I want to get in everything we shall need for the winter as soon\r\nas possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry not to be able to help, but I shall be quite all right\r\nhere.  You will...\" she began, with a quite novel access of timidity,\r\nand finished with a rush,--\"you will be very careful.  I am rather\r\nfearful of that horrid wreckage.  If you never came back----\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be very careful, and I will certainly come back--laden, I hope,\r\nwith good things,\" and he went off on the raft, and she stood watching\r\nand waving her hand at times when he turned, until he disappeared along\r\nthe spit.  And as he went his heart beat high, for he did not believe\r\nthat her fears were chiefly for herself, although she had made it\r\nappear so.\r\n\r\nHe found the wreckage considerably altered.  The gale had swept it bare\r\nof all traces of their previous peckings and nibblings, and had piled\r\nand stuffed it with tempting-looking new plunder.  And with things less\r\nattractive.  Whatever had been left of the mate had disappeared, hurled\r\ndown probably into some black crack.  But, during the day, in various\r\ncrannies he came on no less than three drowned men, partly dressed in\r\nwhat appeared to him naval uniform, anyway not in the usual slops of\r\nthe merchant service.  And they set him thinking how narrow, yet how\r\nsharp, was the dividing line between themselves and the outer world.\r\n\r\nHe built his raft as usual and toiled all day, smashing his way through\r\nscores of boxes, cases, seamen's chests, and rooting in them as eagerly\r\nas ever did the mate, but with a different spirit within him.\r\n\r\nFirst he gathered indispensable stores, and practice had by this time\r\nso perfected his eye that he could tell almost at a glance what a cask\r\nor box contained, how long it had been afloat, and what damage its\r\ncontents were likely to have suffered.\r\n\r\nMany odd, and some extraordinary and incomprehensible, things his hasty\r\nsearch brought to light.  It was indeed an absorbing inquisition into,\r\nan endless revelation of, the ruling passions and frailties of the\r\nhuman heart.\r\n\r\nLittle hoards of money and jewelry were his commonest finds, pitiful\r\nnow in view of their uselessness to those who had gathered them.  But\r\nhe would take from the pile nothing but what it rightly owed them,\r\nmeans of life and the tempering of its hard conditions, and he left all\r\nthese untouched.  Tobacco and pipes, and flints and steel, were lawful\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nOne brass-bound chest he broke open and found great store of women's\r\nclothing, rich with lace and finely wrought even to the eyes of a man.\r\nThe Girl might find that useful and he began to make a selection, with\r\nthe eyes of her delight dancing before him as he did so.  Then with a\r\nstart, and a sharp breath of amazement, he straightened up for a\r\nmoment, crammed everything back into the chest, and hauled it to the\r\nedge of the pile and hurled it into the sea.  For there, at the bottom,\r\nwedged tight among all these delicate draperies was the body of a\r\nnew-born child, strangled at its birth, as he knew by the look of it.\r\n\r\nBundles of letters, papers which might be of highest import to waiting\r\nfriends, anxious heirs, business houses, he found in places, but left\r\nthem as they were.\r\n\r\nHe came on another box containing women's clothes, of plainer material\r\nand simpler make, and rooted carefully after the character of its owner\r\nbefore deciding to take some back for The Girl.  It seemed above\r\nsuspicion, and he rejoiced to be able to supply some of her more\r\npressing needs.  Clothes for himself the wreckage had always been\r\ngenerous of, but to come upon two chests of women's things in one day\r\nwas extraordinary.  They had at times searched far and wide and\r\nanxiously, and never lighted on one.\r\n\r\nHe got back with his load, and in two journeys from the spit got it all\r\non board, before it was too dark for his reward in The Girl's exuberant\r\njoy at the things he had brought for her.\r\n\r\n\"Shoes! ... stockings! ... Some proper needles and thread! ... and oh,\r\nbut I am glad to see these other things! ... I was washing some of my\r\nthings while you were away, but it was not easy with one hand ... And\r\nanother brush and comb! ... and scissors!  If we can clean them I can\r\ncut your hair for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be grateful.  I feel like a savage.  I'll clean them all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you make any strange discoveries?\" she asked, while they sat\r\nat supper, as one asks news of the outer world from a traveller.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heaps.  Jewels and money, and papers, letters and so on----\"\r\n\r\n\"They might be interesting,--in winter days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not thought of that.  I'll bring you an armful tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will go again tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go till I think we have enough for the winter's siege.  There\r\nmay be weeks when I can't get out there.  This storm brought in a\r\nmighty pile of stuff and it's best to get it while it's in good\r\ncondition.  Do you want more clothes if I can find them?\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman never has too many,\" she laughed.  \"But don't waste time\r\nsearching for them.  I can manage very well, especially now that I have\r\nneedles and thread.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just smash open each box as I come to it.  One never knows what one\r\nmay come upon.  Their contents are as different as their owners.  I\r\nhave been trying to imagine them from their belongings.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrought at the pile for many days, and she filled in the time at\r\nhome by evaporating endless pans of water over the fire to get the\r\nsalt, and managed to accumulate quite a fair supply.\r\n\r\nHe brought over for her amusement a great bundle of written papers\r\nwhich she was too busy to delve into at the moment, all her time being\r\ngiven to salt-making.  And then one day he returned exultant with some\r\ngreat lumps of rock salt, such as cattle love to lick, and her little\r\nefforts were like to be put in the shade.  But he averred that her salt\r\nwas infinitely the finer to a cultivated taste and they would use it\r\nonly on very special occasions.\r\n\r\nHe brought her too a quantity of oatmeal in cases, and--treasure-trove\r\nindeed--a dozen cans of the oil used for ships' lights.  He searched in\r\nvain for a lantern, but felt sure he could turn that oil to account in\r\nsome way during the long winter nights.  From the marks on the cases in\r\nthe neighbourhood of these discoveries, and the superior quality of\r\nsome of their contents, he thought a warship must have gone down not\r\nvery far away.\r\n\r\nHis belief was confirmed by finding other unusual supplies in the same\r\nplace, and he worked at it for days until there was hardly a case or\r\nbox or barrel which he had not tapped.\r\n\r\nOne of his greatest finds was a handful of spare tools, in a chest that\r\nhad probably belonged to a ship's carpenter--an auger, a gimlet, a\r\nchisel, a screwdriver, and a small piece of sharpening hone.  And that\r\nsame day he lighted on an unpretentious little box, stoutly made of\r\ndeal, which had swelled with the water to the partial protection of its\r\ncontents.  A glance inside showed him how great was this treasure, and\r\nhe carried it at once to his raft and bestowed it with care.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened the little deal case on deck that evening The Girl gave\r\na joyful cry, \"Books!  Oh, but I am glad, and the winter nights will\r\nnot be long!  Let me see them all quickly.--\"Poems,\" by Robert Burns.\r\n\"Life of Samuel Johnson,\" by James Boswell.  The Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" by Edward Gibbon, Vol 1.  \"The\r\nVicar of Wakefield,\" by Oliver Goldsmith.  \"Tristram Shandy,\" by\r\nLaurence Sterne.  \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by Horace Walpole.  The\r\nAnnual Register--one, two, three volumes.  \"Tom Jones,\" by Henry\r\nFielding.  \"Clarissa Harlowe,\" by Samuel Richardson.  Cruden's\r\nConcordance.  Hymns by Rev. Isaac Watts, D.D.  A Bible.  One, two,\r\nthree volumes of sermons.  John Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and \"Holy\r\nWar,\" and Foxe's \"Book of Martyrs\"!  Oh, we shall do famously.  Now\r\nwhat do you make of the owner of this fine thing?\" she challenged him\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n\"A parson, I should say.  They are the greatest readers.  But that is\r\neasily seen,\" and he turned to the fly-leaves of several of the volumes\r\nand found them all inscribed with the same name, 'James Elwes, Esq.\r\nM.A.  Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford.'\r\n\r\n\"Good Mr Elwes!  I am sorry he is drowned, but I am grateful to him for\r\ntaking his books with him when he travelled, and leaving them behind\r\nhim when he went.  That is the greatest find yet,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"We won't despise the lower things.  All the same I'm glad to have the\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be a wonderful help.  Let us dry them at once.  They are\r\nmore precious than jewels,\" and he got her soft cloths, and they\r\ncarefully mopped up and wiped over every volume and promised them they\r\nshould be set in the sun to complete their cure on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"And those horrid birds?\" she asked, as they worked.  \"You had no\r\ntrouble from them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were all too busy elsewhere.  There is grain enough floating\r\nabout there to feed a city.  They will be plump and happy birds for\r\nsome time to come.  They were too busy even to quarrel and they never\r\nso much as looked my way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI\r\n\r\nAs though exhausted by its late violence, or needing rest before\r\nrenewing it, the weather continued mild and open except for occasional\r\nmists.\r\n\r\nThanks to her own caution and Wulfrey's assiduous attention, The Girl's\r\narm was going on well, and she was looking forward eagerly to being an\r\nactive member of society again.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I have never been laid up in my life before,\" she said, \"and\r\nit is unnatural to me.  A dozen times a day I have to stop that\r\nwretched arm when it wants to do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very little longer and it shall do what it wants, within reason.\r\nLet me rub it again for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a great believer in rubbing,\" she said, with reminiscent\r\nsmiles, as she surrendered the arm to him, and he rubbed it gently and\r\ntirelessly to keep the sinews and muscles from stiffening.\r\n\r\n\"I have found great virtue in it, and great reward,\" he smiled back.\r\n\r\nHe took her ashore almost every day, and they rambled far along the\r\nnorthern beach and enjoyed the soft autumnal days to the full.  But all\r\nthe time his thoughts were on the coming winter whose rigours he had no\r\nmeans of forecasting.  And so, like a wise man, he made such provision\r\nas was possible for the worst.\r\n\r\nHe set her to gathering and drying every herb she deemed suitable for\r\nseasoning purposes.  And he himself caught very many fish and split\r\nthem open and dried them in the sun as he had read was done elsewhere.\r\nHe tried some rabbits in the same way, but they did not take to it and\r\nhad to be used for bait.\r\n\r\nAnd, after a few days' rest from his exertions at the wreckage, he set\r\nto work on building a house on shore, in case anything should happen to\r\nthe 'Jane and Mary,' or they should find solid ground preferable to\r\nwater during the winter gales.\r\n\r\nHe had for a long time past secured every nail he could knock out of\r\nthe old timbers, and regarded them as most precious possessions.  The\r\nfinding of the auger and gimlet opened up wider possibilities.  Where\r\nnails are scarce, a hole and a peg may take their place.  Wood he had\r\nin superfluity, for the remains of every raft that had brought cargo\r\nfrom the pile lay strewn about the spit, in some cases hurled half-way\r\nacross it by the waves that broke there in the storm times.\r\n\r\nWhere best to build was a matter not easily decided.  They would need\r\nall the sunshine obtainable.  But all the heaviest gales came from the\r\nsouth and west and from these they wanted shelter.  And they must be\r\nwithin easy reach of the fresh-water pools and not too far from the\r\nship, where their supplies would be mostly stored.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion they fixed on an odd little hollow--a mere cup in\r\nthe centre of three sandhills of size, which stood close together and\r\nmoreover were well matted with wire-grass and looked too solid to whirl\r\naway in a gale as the smaller hills constantly did.\r\n\r\nTo the south-west of these stood the largest hill in the neighbourhood,\r\nand this would break the force of the gales in that direction.  The\r\nwater-pools lay out in the sandy plain just beyond this hill.\r\n\r\nWulf entered on the building of this first house he had ever attempted,\r\nwith the gusto of a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\"I feel about fourteen,\" he laughed, as he detailed his ideas to her.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,--except this wretched arm, which is one hundred and five.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon have it back to fourteen.  You see, if I can carve out the\r\nsides of those three smaller hills, and back our house into each of\r\nthem, it will make immensely for solidity and warmth.  No gale can blow\r\nthrough a sand-hill, though they do waltz about now and again.  But\r\nthese seem fairly well set and fixed.  I'll start on it tomorrow.  I\r\nwish I had a spade and a saw.  I can chop out some kind of a spade from\r\na plank, maybe, but, lacking a saw, the house will be a bit rough, I'm\r\nafraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter as long as it stands up and keeps us warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll guarantee it will stand up and keep you warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you make a chimney?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking of that.  I will run four boards up through a hole\r\nin the roof, and we must try to induce the smoke to go up.  There is no\r\nclay here, you see, nor stone,--nothing but sand.\"\r\n\r\nThe site settled, he set to work at once rafting his timber across the\r\nlake from the spit, and then hauling it across the sandy plain past the\r\nfresh-water pools, and this gave him a full week's hard labour.  Some\r\nof the lighter planks he let The Girl drag across, since she insisted\r\non having at all events one hand in the work.  The heavier ones were as\r\nmuch as he could handle himself.  In his rest times, and after supper\r\nof a night, he whittled pegs till he had an ample supply, and sharpened\r\nhis axes with the bit of hone he had found in the carpenter's chest.\r\n\r\nWith his axe he hacked out a rude spade from a plank, and trimmed the\r\nhandle and the point with his knife; and then he set to work on his\r\nthree sandhills, cutting down the side of each where it rounded down\r\ninto the cup-like hollow, and flinging the sand into the cup itself to\r\nmake a level floor.\r\n\r\nThe building of such a house was entirely new to him, but he had brains\r\nand he bent them all to every problem that presented itself, and never\r\nfailed to find the way out.  For instance,--the space he wished his\r\nhouse to occupy between the sandhills was quite twelve feet in width,\r\nand his planks ran mostly to six or eight feet only.  There must\r\ntherefore be a row of posts in the middle, with one or more beams on\r\ntop as a ridge-pole, from which he could carry side pieces to the walls\r\nsix feet away on either side, and he had foreseen some difficulty in\r\nfixing these posts absolutely rigid in the yielding sand.  If they\r\nwobbled or gave in any direction his roof would be in danger.\r\n\r\nBut before he began carving down his sand-slopes he had settled that\r\npoint.  He selected his uprights, the longest and strongest in his\r\nstock, chopped them to size, and to the end of each pegged stout flat\r\ncross-pieces, boring the holes with his auger and driving home the pegs\r\nwith the back of his axe.  These he set up in a line in the middle of\r\nthe hollow, standing upright on their cross-piece feet.  Then, as he\r\ncarved down his slope, every spadeful of sand buried the cross-pieces\r\ndeeper, till, when he had finished, they were under two feet of\r\nwell-trampled sand and he looked upon their rigidity as a personal\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThat was surely as extraordinary a house as was ever built by a man who\r\nknew nothing whatever about building.  It took him five full weeks and\r\nhe enjoyed every minute of it.  And so did The Girl, for she sat in the\r\nsun, watching all his cheerful activities with envious eyes because she\r\nwas so unable to share them, discussing points with him as they arose,\r\ngiving suggestions and advice which he always adopted when they chimed\r\nwith his own, and approving heartily of all he did.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could help,\"--how many times she said it, and thought it very\r\nmany more.  \"It is disgusting to have to sit and watch while you work\r\nlike a--like a galley-slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Galley-slaves don't build houses--not such houses as this anyway.\r\nThere never was such a house before,\" he laughed.  \"Besides, you help\r\nmore than you know by simply sitting there and approving of it.  'They\r\nalso serve,' you know, 'who only sit and watch.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Who says that?\"\r\n\r\n\"One John Milton,--not quite in those words, but the meaning is the\r\nsame.  As a matter of fact, he had, I believe, just gone blind when he\r\nsaid it and was feeling rather out of it.  Your arm will soon be all\r\nright again.  It's doing famously.\"\r\n\r\nTruly a wonderful house, not so much because of the quaint way in which\r\nits difficulties were surmounted or evaded--which alone might have\r\ngiven an ordinary builder nightmares for the rest of his life, but more\r\nespecially by reason of the rose-golden thoughts which swept at times\r\nlike flame through hearts and minds of both watcher and builder as they\r\nwrought.  If all those glowing thoughts could have transmuted\r\nthemselves into visible adornment of that rough little home no fairy\r\npalace could have vied with it.\r\n\r\nFor ever and again--and mostly ever--in his heart--helping the auger as\r\nit bored and the axe as it hammered the pegs well home--was the thought\r\nthat was radiant enough and mighty enough to transform that desolate\r\nbank of sand into a veritable Garden of Eden;--\"If no rescue comes,\r\nhere we shall live--she and I--together,--one in heart and soul and\r\nbody, and here, maybe, we shall die.  But death is a long way off, and\r\nLove lives on forever.  I would not exchange my Kingdom for all the\r\nKingdoms of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps he would permit himself a foretaste from the cup of that\r\nintoxicating happiness, in a quick caressing glance at her as she sat\r\nin the sand nursing her arm; and at times she caught those stolen\r\nglances, for her eyes found great satisfaction in his tireless energy\r\nand visible enjoyment in his work.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew as well as if he had told her in words,--nay better, for,\r\nwithout a word, the heart speaks louder than all the words in the world\r\nwhen it shines through honest eyes,--she knew all that possessed him\r\nconcerning her, and she was not discomforted thereby.\r\n\r\nShe trusted him completely.  She had never felt towards any man as she\r\ndid to this man.  Whatever he willed for her would be right.  Her whole\r\nheart and soul rejoiced that he should find such hope and joy in her.\r\nShe was wholly his for the asking, but she knew he would not ask it all\r\nuntil he was satisfied in his own mind that he was right in asking and\r\nshe in giving.\r\n\r\nShe felt like a wounded bird, sitting below there, while her mate built\r\ntheir nest up above.  But not, she said to herself, like their island\r\nbirds, for they were harsh and cruel, with cold hard eyes, and\r\never-craving hunger in place of hearts.\r\n\r\nThat wonderful house, when at last it was finished, would have given no\r\nsatisfaction to the soul of any ordinary builder, but to these two it\r\nwas a monument of hard work and difficulties overcome.\r\n\r\nIt contained one room twelve feet square in front, with two smaller\r\nrooms opening out of it at the back.  The roof sloped slightly from\r\nridge-pole to side-walls and was made in four layers--boards side by\r\nside below, then thick sheets of crimson velvet, an outer shield of\r\noverlapping planks, and a thick coat of sand and growing wire-grass\r\nover all.  He was hopeful that it would withstand the heaviest gales\r\nand rains the winter might bring.  The walls were of stout boards\r\nbacked up against the sandhills, with new sandhills thrown up in the\r\nintervening spaces, and inside they were draped with more crimson\r\nvelvet, of which they had a large supply.  The floor was of planks.\r\nThe door had been a troublesome problem, and, lacking hinges, had to be\r\nlifted bodily in and out of its place.  The bay-window alongside it was\r\nthe cabin skylight from the 'Martha' and this, and the square\r\nsmoke-shaft of four stout boards above the sand hearth, they regarded\r\nas crowning achievements.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by success, and finding enjoyment in the development of a\r\ncraft of which he had never suspected himself until now,--experiencing\r\ntoo, to the very fullest, the primal blessing of work, he evolved an\r\narm-chair for The Girl, out of a barrel that had once held salt pork,\r\nand when its asperities were softened and hidden under voluminous folds\r\nof red velvet she assured him it was the most comfortable chair she had\r\never sat in.\r\n\r\nAnd, for his part, he knew that no girl ever sat in any chair that ever\r\nwas made who could compare with her.\r\n\r\nBeds too he made with some old sail-cloth fitted to rough frames, and a\r\ntable, and their furnishing sufficed, though he promised to add to it\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nThe Girl's arm was well again, though he still urged caution in the use\r\nof it, and kept a watchful eye on it and her; and never had he felt\r\nhimself so full of the joy and strength of life.  When the house was\r\nfinished, they brought over a supply of stores and lived in it for a\r\ntime, and turned the waning autumn days to account by long ramblings\r\nall over the island, in anticipation of the days when ill weather might\r\ncoop them strictly within narrower bounds.\r\n\r\nThere were no discoveries to make in land or sea or sky, scarcely any\r\nin themselves.  He felt assured in his own mind that she was not\r\nunaware of all that he felt for her.  The fact, the great undeniable\r\nfact, that she did not seem to resent it, was a deep joy to him.\r\n\r\nTheir good-comradeship had known no cloud.  She was as charmingly frank\r\nand gracious as ever.  She talked away without reserve or constraint of\r\nthat strange past life of hers, which, in every smallest particular,\r\nwas so absolutely the opposite of this one.  And never once did she\r\ndisplay any hankering after Egypt, rather seemed to regard this as the\r\nPromised Land, or at all events the doorway to it.\r\n\r\nEver and again the possibilities of rescue or escape came to the front\r\nin their discussions, but grew less and less as the weeks went by.  He\r\nhad been seven months on the island, and she four, and save herself, in\r\nall that time no other living soul had come to it,--unless, as the mate\r\nhad so strenuously held, the bodies of those discomforting sea-birds\r\nwere occupied by the souls of drowned sailor men.\r\n\r\n\"And you, you know, were a miracle,\" he would remind her.  \"The chances\r\nagainst you were about a thousand to one----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were that one.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not that I was thinking of----\"\r\n\r\n\"I never forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This place is undoubtedly shunned, as Macro said.  It is known as a\r\ndeath-trap.  No ship comes here except in pieces.  No man comes until\r\nhe is dead.  And so, our prospects of rescue or escape are very small,\r\nI fear.  For your sake I wish it were otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I shown signs of discontent, then?  I assure you I have never\r\nbeen so ... so content to wait and hope.  It is the most delightful\r\nholiday from the world I have ever had....  Sometime perhaps we shall\r\nlook back upon it as the wide dividing line between the old world and\r\nthe new ... and between the old life and the new.\"\r\n\r\n\"A line is black as a rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be light,\" she said, and waved her hand expressively towards\r\nthe shimmering golden spear which the setting sun sent quivering over\r\nthe water right up to their feet, as they stood watching it on the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\n\"If we could only walk on it!\" she said softly, as the red disc swelled\r\nand sank and disappeared amid a glory of tender lucent greens and blues\r\nand glowing orange, with a line of crimson fire on the edge of every\r\nhovering cloud, and a heavenful of crimson flakes and splashes\r\nsmouldering slowly into gray above their heads.\r\n\r\n\"It points the road, but we cannot take it,\" he said quietly, and they\r\nturned and went back to the house.\r\n\r\nThere were times when she thought he was about to tell her all that was\r\nin his heart concerning her.  She could see it in his face and eyes and\r\nrestless manner.  And she was ready to respond.\r\n\r\nThere were times when it was almost more than he could do to keep it\r\nall in.  He believed she knew.  He hardly doubted her response.\r\n\r\nBut he said to himself, with set jaw and a firmer grip of his\r\nmanhood,--\"She has known me just four months.  She is here helpless in\r\nmy hands.  I may not press her unduly, for she might feel that she\r\ncould hardly say me nay.  Her very helplessness must make me the more\r\ncareful and considerate.\"\r\n\r\nAnd more than once, when the desire of his heart was leaping to his\r\nlips, he jumped up abruptly and went out into the night and strode away\r\nalong the beach.  And there he would pace to and fro under the quiet\r\nstars, with the black waves swirling up the shore in long slow gleams\r\nof shimmering silver, till the peace of it all passed into his blood,\r\nand presently he would go quietly in again, with face and heart toned\r\ndown to reasonableness.\r\n\r\nAnd when he went out so, The Girl would smile to herself at times, as\r\none who understood.  And again, at times the smile would slowly fade\r\nand she would sit thoughtful.  But, if she wondered somewhat, and found\r\nhim beyond her complete understanding, she liked him none the less for\r\nhis restraint.\r\n\r\nShe was quite happy in their present fellowship, but she knew it could\r\nnot continue so, indefinitely.  A man always wants more.  The woman\r\ngives.\r\n\r\nShe felt towards this man as she had never felt towards any man before.\r\nWithout a word spoken, she was satisfied as to the integrity of his\r\nintentions, as she had never been of any of those who had approached\r\nher in that old life, and she had been approached by many.  But the\r\ncoinage of love about the Court had grown as debased as did the paper\r\nmoney of the Republic later on.  Whispers of love had become but fair\r\ncloaks for foul deeds.  This man had whispered nothing, but she\r\nunderstood him and held him in honour.\r\n\r\nAnd she was in no hurry.  His love would not burn out, or she was much\r\nmistaken in him.  The flame repressed burns brightest in the end.\r\n\r\nAnd then ... and then....  Well, she sometimes laid hold of the future\r\nby the ears, as it were, and held its changing face while she peered\r\nintently into it, and endeavoured to read there all that it might mean\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nSooner or later he would open his heart to her--and that would be the\r\nfirst change.  Their relationship would of necessity become closer and\r\nwarmer.  She would welcome that.  It would bring great happiness to\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nAnd then--later on--sometime--when all hope of rescue or escape had\r\nleft them ... he would ask still more of her....  That was\r\ninevitable....  And in her heart, hiding behind a thinning cloud of\r\ndoubt, which had, when first it came upon her, been tinged with dismay,\r\nshe knew he would be right, and that in consenting, she would do no\r\nwrong, although it must run counter to all her normal views of right\r\nand wrong.\r\n\r\nShe faced it all squarely and honestly,--Courtship properly ends in\r\nMarriage.  If by this accident of their strange fate the regular\r\nmarriage rites prescribed by the law of the land could not take place,\r\nthey would have to content themselves without them.  It was inevitable.\r\n\r\nElemental views of right and wrong were indeed tap-rooted in her heart\r\nand safe from bruising.  But she recognised that circumstances alter\r\ncases and that normal views were out of place here.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the law of the land--what country claimed this bank of sand\r\nshe did not know.  It was a No Man's Land, outside the pale of all laws\r\nsave God's and Nature's.\r\n\r\nWith no man she had ever met, except this man, could she have imagined\r\nherself considering possibilities such as these.  But with him she\r\nwould feel as safe and happy as if all the archbishops and bishops in\r\nthe land had performed the ceremony.  For, after all, it was only man's\r\nlaw and man's ceremony; and God's law and Nature's were mightier than\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts in her--deep thoughts and long--she could wait\r\nquietly, and she veiled her feelings for him lest he should deem her of\r\nlight mind and too easily to be won.\r\n\r\nNow and again, induced perhaps by some adverse humour of body or\r\natmosphere, a plaguy little fear would leap at her heart and nibble it\r\nwith sharp teeth,--could it be that he had ties in the old life of\r\nwhich he had never dared to hint,--some other woman--to whom he was\r\nbound by honour or by law?\r\n\r\nHe had told her much, and yet not very much.  Had he told her all?  Did\r\nmen ever tell all?  He had told her much, but there was room in what he\r\nhad not told for anything--for everything.\r\n\r\nBut surely he had one time said that he had left no ties behind\r\nhim,--that he was alone.\r\n\r\nIf there should be anything of the kind it would explain his\r\nself-restraint, his quiet service, the looks he could not wholly check,\r\nthe words he did not speak.\r\n\r\nThat his heart had gone out to herself she could not mistake.  But that\r\nwas not incompatible with ties elsewhere that might keep them apart.\r\n\r\nBut fears such as that could not hold her long.  They had sprung up, in\r\nspite of her, once or twice when he had jumped up and left her alone,\r\nand gone out into the night to pace the beach.  But when he returned,\r\nquieted and all himself again, they disappeared at once, and her heart\r\nwas at rest.  Wrong and this man had nothing in common, she said to\r\nherself.  She felt as sure of his honour as of her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII\r\n\r\n\"This weather cannot last much longer,\" he said, one night as they sat\r\ntalking after supper; he with his pipe, which she never would permit\r\nhim to sacrifice on her account, pronouncing the smell of it homely and\r\ncomfortable, in spite of his apologies for the varied qualities of his\r\ntobacco.  \"We must be somewhere near the end of October.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is either the 21st or 22nd or 23rd,\" she said very definitely.\r\n\r\n\"You have kept count?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except the time I was on the mast and before I came to life again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two days probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagined so.  In that case it is the 21st.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we must be ready for November and bad weather.  Would you sooner\r\nstop here or go back to the 'Jane and Mary'?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could not be more comfortable than we are here.  But I will do\r\nwhatever you wish.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her through the wreathing smoke of fire and pipe, for\r\nnothing they could do would make it all go up the chimney.\r\n\r\nWould she say as much if he asked her more? he wondered.\r\n\r\nWas she ready to be asked?  Or was it still too soon?\r\n\r\nIf he told her all that was in his heart, would he startle her out of\r\nthis most pleasant companionship?\r\n\r\nShe sat gazing quietly into the fire of scraps of old ship's timber.\r\nThose leaping tongues of blue and green and yellow and crimson flame\r\nwere a never-failing joy to her.  Many a curious thing had she seen in\r\nthem, and thought many strange thoughts to the tune of their merry\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nShe was winsome beyond words when she sat so, with the lights and\r\nshadows playing over her face, and about the misty dark eyes in which\r\nher clear soul dwelt and shone without disguisements.\r\n\r\nSuppose he said to her--here and now,--\"Avice, dearest, do you know\r\nwhat you are to me?  I cannot possibly tell you in words, but--do you\r\nknow?...\"  And she said \"I know,\"--and said again, \"I will do whatever\r\nyou wish....\"\r\n\r\nAh--God! ... If that could be he would ask no more of life....  One\r\nword from her and this bare bank would be swept with golden fires; in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye it would become a Paradise for him and her to\r\ndwell in....\r\n\r\nIf he sat there looking at her it must out.  He could not keep it in.\r\nAnd why should he?  Why not tell her, here and now? ...\r\n\r\nHe got up quietly and strode out into the night.  A smile hovered in\r\nthe corners of her lips, as, without looking, she caught sight of his\r\nface.  Then she rose also and stole out after him.\r\n\r\nShe was causing him pain when she wished him only joy.  His thought,\r\nshe knew, was all for her.  She would think and act for them both.  If\r\nhe had sat there like a pent-up volcano for another second the hot lava\r\nwould have come rushing out.  She had felt it all in the air.  Her\r\nheart too was so full of expectant joy that the tension was akin to\r\npain.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark, with only throbbing stars in a velvet sky and the\r\nwhite gleam of the foam along the beach.  She did not know which way he\r\nhad gone, but he would come back presently, all himself again.  She\r\nsank down into the side of a hummock and waited.\r\n\r\nHe came at last, slowly, heavily, with bent head.\r\n\r\nHe stopped quite close to her, where the way led to the house, and\r\nstood looking out over the darkness of the sea.  Then he heaved a great\r\nsigh and turned to go back to the house.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" she heard him mutter.  \"If I dared but tell her!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose swiftly out of her form and caught him by the arm, with\r\nsomething between a laugh and a cry, \"Tell me, then!\"--and the mighty\r\narms of his love were round her, gripping her to him till she was\r\nsqueezed almost breathless.\r\n\r\n\"Avice!  Avice!--and you knew!  Oh, thank God for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I knew,\" she gasped.  \"And I want you as much as you want\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for you, dearest!\" he said deeply.  \"We will thank Him all\r\nour lives.  He has given us with a full hand....  I have nothing left\r\nto ask Him ... except your fullest happiness, now and always.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I yours.  You are my happiness.  You give me Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"God requite me ten times over if ever you rue this day.  I have longed\r\nfor you till my heart was sick with the pain of longing----\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish!  Why did you not tell me before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not.  Until I knew....  Placed as we are, you see, it felt\r\nlike forcing you....  You might not have felt free to say no....  It\r\nmight have put an end to all our comradeship....\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know me.  I'd have said no quickly enough if I hadn't wanted\r\nyou.  But I do, and you make me very happy.\"\r\n\r\nHe led her into the house and held her there at arm's length in the\r\nfirelight, as though he could hardly believe it all true, and looked\r\ndeep into the dark eyes and rosy face and kissed it rosier still.\r\n\r\nAnd the blue and yellow and green and crimson flames danced their\r\nmerriest, as these two sat hand in hand watching them, and talking\r\nsoftly by snatches with long sweet silences in between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII\r\n\r\n\"I was so afraid there might be some other to whom you were bound,\" she\r\nsaid, as she lay there in the firelight, with her head against his arm\r\nand his right hand smoothing her hair, that wonderful hair which had\r\nbeen to him as the aureole of a saint and was more to him now than all\r\nthe gold in all the world.\r\n\r\n\"There is no other, my dear one.  Not a soul on earth has any claim on\r\nme except that of friendship....  It was inevitable that we should both\r\nhave that fear.  Four months ago we did not know of one another's\r\nexistence----\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it wonderful?\" she murmured.  \"I wonder if we had never met if\r\nyou would have found someone else----\"\r\n\r\n\"Never anyone to fill my heart as you do.  I cannot even imagine it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I should have found someone else?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is possible, but no one who could feel for you all that I do, or\r\ncould want you as much as I do.  You are to me the one supreme good,\"\r\nand the clasp of his arm told her even more than his words.\r\n\r\n\"You do not ask me if I had any ties in the old life,\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"You would not be lying in my arm like this if there were.  I know you\r\ntoo well.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true and I thank you.  It is good to be taken on trust.  But\r\nindeed there were none.  The men one met there--faugh!--they were\r\nmasquers, puppets, dandies;--some had brains, but few had hearts, and\r\nthey were most dreadful liars.  Such talents as they possessed were\r\ndevoted to finesse and intrigue, and the turning of everything to their\r\nown satisfaction and advantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God you are out of it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do thank God,--for the shipwreck and everything else, but\r\nchiefly that He sent you here to meet me and took that other one away.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather held still for a few days, and he spent them in providing\r\nfor her future comfort in every way he could think of.\r\n\r\nHe chopped logs enough to last them through the winter, and piled them\r\nin stacks about the house.  He got over from the ship supplies in\r\nabundance.  As the result of much labour and many failures he\r\nconstructed a primitive lamp out of the silver mug from which Macro\r\nused to swill his rum.  He distorted a beak out of one side of it, and\r\ncontrived a wick which passed through a hole in a piece of beaten\r\ncopper, and if the light was not brilliant it was at all events\r\nsteadier to read by than the dancing flames.\r\n\r\nHe had lighted quite by accident on Macro's hidden hoard in the hold of\r\nthe 'Jane and Mary.'  He was rooting in a corner there for his knife,\r\nwhich had worked out of its sheath at his back as he hoisted out\r\nprovisions, and found it sticking point downwards in a plank.  As he\r\npulled it out, the plank gave slightly, and lifting it he found,\r\nunderneath, the useless treasure.\r\n\r\nHe wanted none of it, was indeed loth to touch it, but, on\r\nconsideration, took out two more silver mugs for their daily service\r\nand half a dozen gold pins and brooches for Avice's use, since she was\r\nalways needing such things and regretting her lack of them.\r\n\r\nThe long spell of mild soft weather--which had come at last to have in\r\nit a sense of sickness and decay--broke up in the wildest storm they\r\nhad yet seen.\r\n\r\nThe birds came whirling in in a shrieking cloud, but the wind\r\nout-shrieked them.  It shrilled above their heads in a ceaseless\r\nstrident scream like the yelling of souls in torment.  It shook their\r\nprotecting sandhills and made their house shiver right down to the\r\nburied cross-pieces of its pillars.  It picked up the smaller hummocks\r\noutside and set them waltzing along the shore.  It heaped a foot of new\r\nsand on their roof and sent a cartload of it down the chimney.\r\n\r\nBut their position had been well chosen.  The more the sand piled on\r\ntheir house and against it, the tighter it became.  Then the rain came\r\ndown in sheets and torrents, but no drop came through, except down the\r\nchimney, and that Wulf presently plugged with a blanket and let the\r\nsmoke find its way out through an inch of opened door, which he had\r\npurposely placed to leeward, as all their great storms came from the\r\nsouth and south-west.\r\n\r\nBut the change of atmosphere was bracing, and with solid sand under\r\ntheir feet, and assured of the safety of their house, they welcomed it\r\nand felt the better for it.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day's confinement he must out to see, and she would not\r\nstay behind.  So they rigged themselves in oldest garments and fewest\r\npossible and started out.\r\n\r\nThey were drenched to the skin in a second and whirled away like leaves\r\nthe instant they forsook the cover of their hollow.\r\n\r\nAvice was being carried bodily towards their nearest shore.  He feared\r\nshe would go headlong into the sea and started wildly after her.  He\r\nsaw her throw herself flat and grip at the sand, but she was broadside\r\non to the merciless wind and it bowled her over and over, and rolled\r\nher along like a ball.  It carried him along in ten-feet leaps.  He\r\nflung himself down beside her, put his arm round her, wrenched her head\r\nto the gale, and they lay there breathless, she choking hysterically\r\nwith paroxysms of laughter.\r\n\r\nIt took them an hour, crawling like moles, to get back to the shelter\r\nof the hills.  He would have had her go in, but she would not hear of\r\nit.  They could hear the booming thunder of the great waves on the spit\r\neven above the wind, and she must see them.\r\n\r\nSo they set off once more, flat to the sand, and worked round in time\r\nto the breast of the great hill near the fresh-water pools, and lay in\r\nit, safe from dislodgment unless the hill went too.\r\n\r\nThey could only peer through pinched eyes, and then only with their\r\nhands over them, into the teeth of that wind, but, even so, the sight\r\nwas magnificent and appalling.  The grim gray sky and the grim gray sea\r\nmet just beyond the spit, and out of that close sky the huge gray waves\r\nburst, high as houses,--whole streets of houses rushing headlong to\r\ndestruction.  They curved gloriously to their fall with a glint of\r\nmuddy green below and all their crests abristle with white foam-fury.\r\nRight out of the sky they came, right up to the sky they seemed to\r\nreach, flinging up at it great white spouts of spray like flouting\r\ncurses, towering high above the land, crashing down upon it with a\r\nthunderous roar which thinned the voice of the wind to no more than a\r\nshrill piping.\r\n\r\nTheir own land-locked lake was lashed into fury also.  The flying\r\ncrests of the outer waves came rocketing over in wild white splashes.\r\nHe was not sure that some of the waves themselves did not cover the\r\nspit and come roaring into it.  The 'Jane and Mary' danced wildly to\r\nher cable.  He wondered if it would hold.  The 'Martha,' more than ever\r\non her beam-ends, was being pounded like a drum.\r\n\r\n\"Did you feel that?\" he shouted in her ear, and she nodded, with a\r\ntouch of fear in her wind-blown face.  For, under the impact of one\r\nvast mountainous avalanche, the very ground on which they lay seemed to\r\nshake like a jelly, and the whole island shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot wash it all away, can it?\" she gasped, when they had wormed\r\ntheir way back to shelter.\r\n\r\n\"It never has done yet anyway,\" he said cheerfully, as he squeezed\r\nwindy tears out of his smarting eyes.  \"Now, dear, change all your\r\nthings at once.  We are wet through to the bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very wonderful.  I wouldn't have missed it for anything.  But\r\nI'm glad we're ashore,\" and she slipped away into her own room.\r\n\r\nThat was the first of the winter storms, and there were many like it.\r\nBut they bore them equably.  They were in splendid health, the weather\r\nat its worst was never very cold, indeed the gales were more to their\r\ntaste than the smothering chill of the frequent fogs.  They had all\r\nthey needed,--food and fire, and light and books, a weather-tight\r\nhouse, and one another.\r\n\r\nIf they lacked much of what their former life had taught them to\r\nconsider necessary, they had more than all that former life had given\r\nthem, and they were happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV\r\n\r\nBetween the storms and fog-spells, they tramped to and fro discovering\r\nthe changes wrought in their island, and many a strange thing their\r\nwanderings showed them.\r\n\r\nOne great gale which lasted a full week strewed the south-west Point\r\nwith wreckage as thickly almost as the great pile beyond.  Their hearts\r\nached at thought of the still greater loss it represented, of which the\r\nproofs were never lacking.  The chaotic bristle was studded with the\r\nbodies of the drowned, and the sight sent them home sorrowfully, yet\r\nmarvelling the more at their own deliverance, and still more grateful\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\"We are miracles, without a doubt,\" said Wulf gravely, as they went\r\nback home.  \"No one else gets here alive, you see....  I was the first\r\nmiracle.  Macro was the second,\" and he told her what she had not known\r\nbefore, how he had contrived to save the mate, and of his regret that\r\nit had not been old Jock Steele the carpenter, who would have been a\r\nblessing to them instead of a curse.  \"And you are the third and best\r\nmiracle of all,\" he said, clasping her arm more tightly under his own.\r\n\"God! what a difference it has made!\" he said fervently.  \"Alone here\r\none might go mad.  In time one most certainly would.  See how good a\r\nwork you are accomplishing by simply remaining alive.  Instead of being\r\na melancholy madman you make me the happiest man on earth.  Oh, the\r\nGod-given wonder of a woman!  Truly you are the greatest miracle of\r\nall, and He has been good to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to me.  If you had not been here I should have been dead and we\r\nwould never have met.  Perhaps He sent us to one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure He did, and all our lives we'll thank Him for it,\" and so the\r\nsight of the dead but put a keener edge on their gratitude for life and\r\ntheir joy in one another.\r\n\r\nThe next big storm washed the point clean again.  All had gone,\r\nwreckage, bodies, everything, and the great pile beyond bristled higher\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\"Do you notice anything strange?\" he asked her, as they stood looking\r\nout at it.\r\n\r\n\"There seems more of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not a bird to be seen.  They've all gone for the winter, I expect.\r\nWe shall not see them again till next year.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad.  They are evil things.  Our Paradise is sweeter without\r\nthem,\" and he kissed her for the word.\r\n\r\nThe weird forces of the gales, however, afforded them many surprises.\r\n\r\nTramping round the further end of their lake one day, they saw changes\r\nin the great stretch of sand that ran out of sight towards the eastern\r\npoint.  What had been a level plain was scored and furrowed as by a\r\nmighty ploughshare.  It was like a rough sea whose tumbling waves had\r\nin an instant been turned into sand--league-long grooves with\r\nhigh-piled ridges between, and in the hollows the watery sun glinted\r\nbriefly here and there on shining white objects sticking out of the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n\"Bones!\" said Wulf in surprise, as they stood looking into the first\r\nhollow, and he jumped down and picked up a human skull.\r\n\r\n\"Horrid!\" said Avice.  \"And there's another, and another over there.\r\nIt's a regular grave-yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"A battle-field, I should say,\" as he examined them one after another.\r\n\"This is very curious.  This fellow was killed by a bullet through the\r\nhead.  Here's the hole.  And this one's skull was split with an axe or\r\na sword.  This one also.  I wonder what it all means....\"\r\n\r\n\"Pirates and murderers.  That's what they look like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder....  Here's an ancient cutlass.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's this?\"--rooting at something with her foot....  \"An old\r\npistol! ... and the hilt of another sword! ... I wonder if they were\r\nthe men who lived on our ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe.  But I think these things are older than the ships....\r\nWhy--the place is thick with them,\" as they wandered on.  \"There must\r\nbe scores of them, and more still underneath the ridges, no doubt....\r\nThere was no lack of life here at one time evidently----\"\r\n\r\n\"And death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and death without a doubt.  A good thing for us, perhaps, that\r\ncustomers such as these don't frequent it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad we live at the other end.  You haven't found any bones there,\r\nhave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bone!  They're not very cheerful company.  Let us hope the next\r\ngale will cover them up again.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on, in another trench, they found one side of a boat, mouldered\r\nalmost into the similitude of the sand in which it had been embedded\r\nfor very many years.  And, further along still, Wulf thought he could\r\nmake out the stark ribs of ships like those on the outer banks at their\r\nown end of the island.  But they were very far away and held out no\r\ninducement to closer investigation, and Avice had had enough of such\r\nthings for the time being.\r\n\r\nThere were spells of bad weather, when, for days at a time, they\r\nscarcely ventured out except to get in wood or fetch water from the\r\npools, which always meant a thorough soaking.\r\n\r\nBut they were completely happy in one another's company, and ever more\r\ngrateful for the Providence that had cast their lot together.\r\n\r\nThe days slipped by without one weary hour.  Shrewder and subtler\r\nproving of hearts and temperaments could hardly be conceived.  But they\r\nstood the test perfectly, never thought of it as such, found in their\r\npresent estate nothing but cause for joy and deepest thankfulness.\r\n\r\nThe depth and warmth of his love for her expressed itself in most\r\ndevoted service and tenderest care, and hers for him in so frank and\r\nimplicit a confidence that he felt it an uplifting honour to be so\r\nfavoured.  Indeed the man who could have betrayed so great a trust must\r\nhave been lowest of the low and basest of his kind.\r\n\r\n\"I can't help wondering sometimes whether we would have felt like this\r\nto one another if we had met in an ordinary way, outside there,\" she\r\nsaid musingly, one night, as she lay in the hollow of his arm, watching\r\nthe coloured flames.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said emphatically.  \"For you laid hold of my heart as soon as\r\nI set eyes on you.  It got tangled first in the meshes of your hair,\r\nand in your long eyelashes, and the thing I wanted most was to see what\r\nyour eyes were like.  They were wells of mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--they were right?\" she laughed softly.\r\n\r\n\"They were exactly right and just what I had hoped.  Large and dark and\r\neloquent and tender and true and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear! dear!  If I had known such an inquisition was going I should\r\nhave been afraid to open them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you didn't know me, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you, but I knew I was all right as soon as I saw you.  I\r\nknew I could trust you....  How strange and wonderful it all was!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV\r\n\r\nOne strange and terrible experience they had when the winter was almost\r\nover, and it came within measurable distance of making an end of them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nDepending on their reserve stock of flour on board the 'Jane and Mary,'\r\nthey had used freely what they had on shore.  When he opened the other\r\nhe found to his dismay that it must have been more damaged at first\r\nthan he imagined.  It was nearly all mouldy and smelt badly.  He had\r\nrun short of tobacco also, and so decided to go over to the pile for\r\nsupplies on the first possible day.\r\n\r\nThe worst of the storms seemed over.  They had occasional brisk\r\ngleaming days in between times, and on one such, after seeing that\r\nAvice had all she would need in his absence, they set off along the\r\nnorthern shore.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to go out with him, but he dissuaded her from that.  The\r\ncrossing would be very different from what it was in the summer and he\r\nwould not have her exposed to it.  Besides, he intended to make only a\r\nshort job of it, just get what he wanted, and be back almost before she\r\nknew he had gone.  She was so loth to be parted from him, however, even\r\nfor that short time, that she insisted on walking with him to the point\r\nand said she would sit there and wait till she saw him on his way back.\r\n\r\nSo she sat down in the sand and drew her blanket cloak about her, and\r\nwatched him wade and swim and at last scramble up on to the pile.  He\r\nwaved his hand to her and then set to work constructing a raft as usual.\r\n\r\nShe saw him climbing to and fro among the wreckage, smashing away at\r\ncasks and cases, and then, to her dismay, he and the pile and the gaunt\r\nwrecks beyond disappeared completely, wiped out by a bank of mist that\r\nhad come sweeping in from the sea.  The sun still shone up above, but\r\nintermittently.  Dark clouds came rushing up out of the south and\r\npresently it too was hidden.  The wind blew gustily and increased in\r\nviolence every minute.\r\n\r\nShe wished he had not gone.  She could do no good by stopping there,\r\nbut she did not care to go home.  Behind her, on the southern shore,\r\nthe waves were beginning to break with the short harsh sounds that\r\nportended storm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would leave his work and swim across.  He would know she was\r\nwaiting for him.  She must wait till he came.  She drew her blanket\r\nover her head and sat there, huddled up with her back to the wind, and\r\nhoped and prayed.  For, if this sudden storm should work up into a gale\r\nand last, she would be full of fears for his safety.\r\n\r\nSuppose he should be drowned!  What that awful pile would be like in\r\nbad weather she dared not think.\r\n\r\nShe prayed wildly for his life,--\"Oh God, spare him to me!  He is all I\r\nhave!  Spare him!  Have pity on us both!  Spare him!  Spare him!\"--over\r\nand over again the same ultimate cry, for her mind was closed to every\r\nother thought but this, that the man she loved more than anything on\r\nearth was out there in peril of his life.\r\n\r\nShe stayed there, drenched by the rain and flailed by the wind, till it\r\nbegan to grow dark, and then she crept wearily home like a broken bird.\r\n\r\nGrim fear gripped her heart like an icy hand, but she would not despair\r\nentirely.  He was so strong and capable.  He might have tried and found\r\nit impossible to get back.  He might come in at any minute.\r\n\r\nIf he were here the first thing he would have told her was to change\r\ninto dry clothes.  She changed, and made up the fire and put on the\r\nkettle.  He would be cold and hungry when he came.  She must be ready\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut there on the wreckage, Wulf had been so hard at work that he\r\nnoticed no sign of change in the weather, till the clammy mist swept\r\nover him and blotted out everything but the box he was delving into.\r\n\r\nThe winter storms had wrought great changes in the pile.  It seemed\r\nthicker and higher and more chaotic than ever, bristling with new stuff\r\nwhich he would have liked to investigate, in case it should contain\r\nanything that would add to Avice's comfort.\r\n\r\nBut first, to find some decent flour, and, as it happened, there seemed\r\nfewer barrels about than usual, and most of them had suffered in their\r\nrough transit.  The search for a good one took time.  Such as he found\r\nwere gaping and he did not trouble to open them.  However, he\r\ndiscovered one at last, opened it to make sure of the goodness of its\r\nheart and then turned to seek tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the fog swept down on him and chained him to three\r\nsquare feet or so of precarious foothold.  Trespass beyond that limit\r\nmight mean a broken limb or neck, for the surface of the pile was\r\nseamed with ragged rifts and chasms, in which the tide whuffled and\r\ngrowled like a wild beast anticipating food.\r\n\r\nSo he rooted away in the chest he had just smashed open, lighted on a\r\nsupply of tobacco to his great satisfaction, and then sat down where he\r\nwas, to wait till the fog cleared.  But this, he perceived, was not one\r\nof their usual clinging fogs which enveloped one like a pall of\r\ncotton-wool.  It drove on a rising wind and sped past him in dense\r\nwhirling coils that made his head spin.  He thought briefly of mighty\r\nspirits of the air trailing ghostly garments in rapid flight.  Down\r\nbelow him, in the black rifts and along the sides of the pile, the\r\nwater was yapping savagely, as if the wild beast would wait no longer.\r\n\r\nWhen the last of the fog tore past him in tattered fragments, he found\r\nto his dismay that the sea between him and home was beyond any man's\r\nswimming,--every channel raging and foaming, and the banks between\r\nboiling furiously in the rising tide and the rush of the south-west\r\nwind.  The raft he had made had already broken loose and started\r\nnorthwards on its own account.  It went to pieces on the nearest bank,\r\nas he watched, and swept away in fragments.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but waiting.  So sudden a storm might pass as\r\nquickly as it had come.\r\n\r\nFor himself he had no great fears.  The pile had stood a thousand\r\nstorms, and worse ones than this.  But he was filled with anxiety on\r\nAvice's account.  She would imagine the worst when he did not come, and\r\nher suffering would be great.  Thought of her troubled him infinitely\r\nmore than fear for himself.\r\n\r\nHe tried hard to make her out on the beach, though how to reassure her\r\nhe did not know.  But the sky was overcast and the atmosphere murky\r\nwith sweeping showers, and he could not even see the point.\r\n\r\nHe was wet through with his swim, and the wind, though not cold in\r\nitself, was so strong that it chilled him.  He searched about for\r\nshelter, and coming on a huge case which presented a solid back to the\r\nweather, he stove in the front and found it contained fine lace\r\ncurtains.  He hauled out a sufficiency, which the wind whisked\r\nplayfully away.  Then he crept into their place, grateful for so much,\r\nand lay and watched the strange writhings and contortions of the pile\r\nunder the impact of the gale and the rising tide.\r\n\r\nThe wind would go down with the tide probably, and then he would make\r\nanother raft and get home as quickly as he could with his flour.  For,\r\ngreat as Avice's anxiety would certainly be, they were still short of\r\nflour, and it would be better to take it with him than to have to come\r\nback for it.  The wreck-pile in a gale was a decidedly unpleasant\r\nexperience, and its behaviour most extraordinary.  He had never\r\nimagined a dead conglomeration such as that capable of such antics.\r\nWhen the tide was at its height the whole mass writhed and shuddered\r\nthrough all its length and breadth like some great monster in its death\r\nagonies.  The rifts and chasms gaped and closed like grim black wounds\r\nor hungry mouths.  Strange and awesome sounds broke out all about,\r\ngroanings and creakings, ragged rendings and grindings, as the\r\ncomponent pieces lifted and settled regardless of their neighbours.\r\nWhen the tide went down it was more at ease, and the only sounds were\r\nthe waves snapping at the sides and gurgling and rushing in the depths\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nHe did not find it very cold.  Sheltered from the wind, the heat of his\r\nbody in time made a warm nook round him in the heart of the curtains.\r\nBut he was never dry.  And before it got too dark, when he saw it would\r\nbe impossible to get away that night, he crept out and crawled\r\nprecariously to and fro till he lighted on a small cask of rum.  He\r\ncarried it to his shelter, knocking in the head with his axe, and it\r\nkept his blood warm through the night.  But it was a terribly long\r\nnight, chiefly because he was thinking all through it of Avice, and her\r\nfears for him, and her suffering.\r\n\r\nTo his bitter disappointment, morning showed no signs of abatement or\r\nrelief.  It brought another wild gray day without a glimmer of hope in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nHe had eaten nothing for more than twenty hours and was feeling empty\r\nand ravenous.  The tide had risen and gone down again in the night.\r\nBefore the pile began its writhings and contortions again he must eat.\r\nSo he crept out and foraged till he found a barrel of pork, and bashed\r\nit open and carried back to his nest a big chunk which he ate raw and\r\nwashed down with rum.\r\n\r\nAll that day the gale held.  He hardly dared to think of Avice and yet\r\ncould think of nothing else.  At times, under the impulse of his fears\r\nfor her, he was tempted to leap into the sea and try to battle through\r\nto the point.  But when he studied the chances of it, common sense\r\nprevailed.  Adventure into those boiling currents meant death as surely\r\nas if he cut his throat on the pile.\r\n\r\nIf he could only let her know that he was alive....  If he had had his\r\nflint and steel he would have tried to set something on fire--even if\r\nit were his nest--on the chance of her seeing the smoke and\r\nunderstanding it.  He searched eagerly for another tinder-box, but\r\ncould not light on one.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious and gloomy man that crept into the heart of the\r\ncurtain-case that night; but he slept, in a way and brokenly, in spite\r\nof it all, for Nature knows man's limits, and when he goes beyond them\r\nshe steps in at times and takes command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI\r\n\r\nTo Avice, also, that first night was one long horror.\r\n\r\nShe made up the fire and sat waiting for him to come.  He would know in\r\nwhat a state of despair she would be and he would certainly come.  She\r\nwas sure he would come--if he could.  If he did not it was because he\r\ncould not.  And ... if he could not....\r\n\r\nThe wind shrilled eerily outside.  It sounded cold and heartless ...\r\npitiless ... like messages from the dead ... warnings of evil.  It got\r\non her nerves and set her shivering.  She crept to her room at last and\r\ndropped hopelessly on to her bed, and lay there sorely stricken.\r\n\r\nIn the gray of the morning she ate mechanically, and hurried away to\r\nthe point for sign or sight of him.  But it was all she could do to\r\nmake out the pile itself, like a bristling rampart in the dull dim\r\ndistance.  As to distinguishing anything on it, that was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nShe wandered about there all day long, with her eyes strained on the\r\npile like one bereft, and only crept back when night shut it out and\r\ndrove her home.\r\n\r\nShe was satisfied in her own mind now that he was dead.  If he had been\r\nalive he would certainly have come.  Well, she would not be long in\r\nfollowing him....  Without him she had no desire to live ... even if\r\nshe could struggle on alone, which was very doubtful ... better to join\r\nhim quickly than to drag on miserably all by herself on that lonely\r\nbank, and go crazy in the end.\r\n\r\nShe sobbed herself asleep, her last wish that she might never waken.\r\nShe had eaten nothing since the morning, and then only a hasty scrap\r\nthat had no taste in it.  The fire had gone out....  It did not matter.\r\nShe would go out herself as soon as might be....  A woful end to all\r\ntheir golden hopes and happiness.\r\n\r\nMorning found her still lying spent and hopeless on her bed, comatose,\r\nneither asleep nor awake, simply careless of life and even of the fact\r\nthat the wind had fallen at midnight and that the new day had broken\r\nsoft and clear.\r\n\r\nThen, in her dream-weariness, she heard a voice in the outer room--or\r\nthought she did--but all her senses were dulled except the sense of\r\nloss and heartache.  People, she knew, heard voices when they were\r\ngoing to die.\r\n\r\n\"Avice!\"--the voice of God calling her--the sweet voice of death.  She\r\nwas ready to go.\r\n\r\n\"Avice!  Where are you?\"--and a tapping on the wall of her room.\r\n\r\nHow like Wulfrey's voice!  Perhaps he was permitted to be the\r\nmessenger,--a gracious thought--a joyful thought.\r\n\r\nShe rose painfully, stiff with weakness and long lying, stumbled to the\r\ndoorway, stood leaning her hands against the sides, and peered,\r\nwhite-faced and awe-stricken, through the curtains into the room.\r\nThen, with a broken cry, she threw up her hands and fell forward into\r\nWulf's arms.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to herself she was lying on a blanket outside the house\r\nand he was bathing her forehead and kissing her.  She lay looking up at\r\nhim in wonder, out of eyes almost lost in the mists and darkness of her\r\nsuffering.  She raised a hand and touched his face.\r\n\r\n\"Are you real?  Are you alive?\" she whispered doubtfully.\r\n\r\nHe proved it with hot kisses.  His eyes swam with pity for her\r\nsufferings.  Her face and eyes told him all the story.\r\n\r\n\"By God's mercy we are both alive, dear.  It might have been\r\notherwise....  You have suffered sorely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were sent for me ... the angel of Death.  And it was so\r\ngood of them to send you and not a stranger....  But it is better to\r\nhave you alive,\" and happy tears welled weakly out of her eyes and\r\nrolled down the white cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you have eaten nothing since I went.  Lie still and I will\r\nget you something,\" and he jumped up and went inside, lighted the fire\r\nquickly, and presently was sitting by her side, feeding her with warm\r\nrum and water, for she was icy cold, and some bits of the cakes she had\r\nmade three days before.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to have starved yourself like that,\" he remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"I was sure you were dead and I had no wish to live....  You will never\r\ngo out there again....\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the break of a storm anyway.  We must go to the storehouse\r\nsometimes, but we'll make sure of our weather in future.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have minded if I'd been with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would.  It was ghastly out there in the night,\" and he told her how\r\nhe had lived in the big case of curtains, and how the pile heaved and\r\nwrithed like a wounded sea-serpent under the tide and the gale.  And\r\nhow he had brought back some flour after all, though it had been no\r\neasy job as there was no wind to help him.\r\n\r\n\"It is dear flour,\" she said.  \"It nearly cost us our lives.  I would\r\nsooner live on raw meat another time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII\r\n\r\nThat was their sorest trial of the winter.  Often, over the fire of a\r\nnight, they talked of it and told one another all there was to tell of\r\ntheir feelings and their fears, and their love burned the brighter for\r\nits tempering.\r\n\r\nBut Avice was soon herself again, and as the Spring quickened all about\r\nand in them, the bitterness of the experience gradually faded out of\r\ntheir recollection and only the brightness was left.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was so much to interest one everywhere that the days\r\nwere hardly long enough for all there was to see and do.\r\n\r\nFirst, seals--mothers and babies galore.  Those sandy beaches of the\r\nnorthern coast seemed a favourite basking place and nursery, and Avice\r\ncould creep along behind the sandhills, and crawl up among the\r\nwire-grass, and peep over, and she never tired of watching them.  There\r\nwas something so human in the way the babies snuggled up to their\r\nmothers when they were hungry, and still more in the way the mothers\r\nlooked down at their nurslings.\r\n\r\nAnd the baby-rabbits.  They were almost as entrancing as the seals, but\r\nfar shyer and more difficult to spy upon.\r\n\r\nFor the simple lifting of a head among the sparse tufts of grass set\r\nthe hollow below alive with tiny bobbing white scuts, whose terrified\r\nowners tumbled over one another in their anxiety to get below ground.\r\nAvice would not hear of rabbit-meat in those days.  She said the very\r\nthought of it made her feel like a cannibal.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly,--birds.  They were coming back in flights.  The eastern\r\npoint seemed their chosen ground, but closer at hand stray families\r\nwere found, and importunate babies were being fed by the cold-eyed\r\nmothers with whom, a few months later, they would be waging the fierce\r\nbattle for food.  But Avice never took to the birds as she did to the\r\nseals and rabbits.  She could never forget what they would grow\r\ninto--brigands and fighters and cold-blooded raucous screamers at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nNow and again they lived on the 'Jane and Mary' for a week by way of a\r\nchange, and fish was always obtainable whether they were afloat or\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nThe clear fire of their love waxed ever stronger, devoured the days and\r\nweeks and months, and refined and fused them all into golden memories\r\nwithout one smallest speck of alloy.  More devoted lover never woman\r\nhad, nor man a sweeter mistress.  Never was princess of the\r\nblood--without a bar across her scutcheon--held in loftier esteem or\r\nshown it more gallantly.  Never, in word or act, did he offend her\r\nsense of right in the smallest degree; yet she could set his heart\r\nleaping and his blood racing by a touch--and she knew it.\r\n\r\nSometime,--when he believed it right--she knew he would ask more of\r\nher.  It was inevitable.  She had known it from the beginning.  And she\r\nhad no fear of it.  Love such as theirs knows nothing of fear.\r\n\r\nThey were not playing at love.  They loved with all the white fire of\r\npassionate devotion which loses sight of self in the one beloved.  For\r\nbetter, for worse; in life, in death, she was wholly his.  With the\r\nardour of the Spring in her blood, and the love-light in her eyes, she\r\nwaited for him to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII\r\n\r\nTime came when, according to her calendar, he had been there full\r\ntwelve months and she just about nine.  And as to prospect of escape,\r\nor further addition to their company, they were in exactly the same\r\nposition as when they came.\r\n\r\nWhenever they discussed that matter, she said, \"Still, I came ashore\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he always said, \"You were the miracle.  Besides you were\r\nnine-tenths dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe wondered when he would ask the next step of her, and how he would\r\ndo it.  Her answer was ready--herself.  Still, something of extra\r\nfragrance--something ineffably sweet and delicate--would cling to it\r\nfor ever, or be for ever just that much lacking, according to the\r\nmanner of his asking.\r\n\r\nBut she believed his great love would choose the proper chord and\r\nstrike it with strong and gentle fingers.\r\n\r\nAnd it did.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the firelight one night, when a more than usually\r\npregnant silence fell on them.  The depth of their feeling for one\r\nanother expressed itself not infrequently in these long delicious\r\npauses in their talk, when that which was in them was all too sacred\r\nfor words.  Her Northern blood, of which she was proud, prevailed as a\r\nrule over the Gallic strain, which she held in light esteem, and made\r\nfor undemonstrativeness in any outward display of feeling.  But she\r\nfelt to the depths, and when she did permit the brakes to slip, the\r\nwheels struck sparks.\r\n\r\nHe also was more doer than talker.  Hence those long sweet silences,\r\nwhen she lay with her head in his arm in the coloured firelight, and\r\nthe gentle play of his hand on her hair was more to them both than all\r\nthe words in the world.\r\n\r\nBut this night there was more in the silences that fell on them.  In\r\nboth their hearts the high-charged thoughts and feelings of many months\r\nwere converging to a point.  The quickening of the Spring was in their\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHis hand slipped suddenly down from her hair and clasped on both of\r\nhers where they lay in her lap.  His voice as he spoke was deep with\r\nemotion.  It thrilled her to the depths.  She felt the hot pulses in\r\nhis hand leaping and throbbing.  His words were very simple, as became\r\na matter so vital.  Deepest feeling needs no garnishment.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest, you have honoured me with your trust and love\"----  Her hands\r\nturned and clasped his fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Every hair of your head is precious to me.  I would not knowingly\r\noffend your feelings in any smallest thing....  We are here, cut off\r\nfrom our kind, it may be, for ever....  We are as alone here with God,\r\nas Adam and Eve were in The Garden....  You make my Paradise.  You can\r\nperfect it....  Will you?...\"\r\n\r\nAnd for answer she put up her arms, and drew down his face, and kissed\r\nhim passionately, and clung to him as if she would never let him go.\r\n\r\n\"I thank God for so precious a gift,\" he said, clasping her to him so\r\nthat she felt his heart pounding inside as furiously as her own.\r\n\r\n\"Heart ... soul ... body ... all yours!\" she whispered, and he kissed\r\nher hair, because her face was hidden, and clasped her closer still.\r\n\r\n\"It is the ordained crown of our love,\" he said presently, when their\r\nfirst blinding whirl of emotion was over.  \"I cannot see that we offend\r\nany law of man's, for here we are beyond the law.  God's law we are\r\nsurely keeping....  And, so as not to act on simple impulse I have\r\nthought that we would let another month go by before...\" and he kissed\r\nher rosy face again.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have not thought it all out as I have----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have ... I knew it must be so....\" and the joy in him was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\"All the same, dear, we will not enter into that high estate without\r\nyour very fullest consideration....  And if you should find any reason\r\nor instinct against it I shall abide by your decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all yours.  I shall not change.\"\r\n\r\n\"From what the mate said I imagine this island may pertain to Nova\r\nScotia.  It is possible that Scottish law runs there....  We can take\r\none another for man and wife and place it on record....\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have books with fly-leaves.  Among the sand-hills you will find all\r\nthe quills you want.  The birds are some use after all....  Anyone can\r\nmake a pen ... and ink we can always get even though it is red....  All\r\nwe need for a good Scots marriage is a pair of witnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seals, rabbits, birds....\"\r\n\r\n\"They cannot testify....  All we can do,\" he said thoughtfully, \"if, by\r\nGod's mercy, we ever leave this place is to regularise ourselves by\r\nproper marriage ashore as soon as we land.  But the prospects of\r\ngetting away seem very small, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been very happy here.  We can still be very happy here,\" she\r\nsaid contentedly.\r\n\r\nSo amazing is this great power of Love in covering all deficiencies of\r\noutward circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX\r\n\r\nThe days slipped past, and each day he watched her quietly for\r\nslightest sign of compunction, or retraction.  And if such had come to\r\nher, sore though he might have felt, and bereaved of the perfect\r\nunfolding of the fair flower of their love, he would have choked the\r\nfeeling down, trampled on it, buried it so that she would have seen no\r\nsign of it in him.  For he recognised to the fullest what a mighty\r\nthing this was that he was asking of her.\r\n\r\nBut she understood him perfectly, fathomed his fears, was on the\r\nlook-out for his quietly-questioning looks, and met them with clear\r\nfull-eyed serenity and a face rosy at times with anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"You need not fear for me,\" she laughed softly, one night as she lay in\r\nhis arm before the fire.  \"I shall not change.\"\r\n\r\nHe clasped her closer.  \"I could not blame you if you did.  From every\r\nworldly point of view you would be right----\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we to do with worldly points of view?  We are out of it all.\r\nWe are here alone, and like to be.  And we are doing right in our own\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would risk my soul on what seems right to these pure eyes,\" and he\r\nbent and kissed them warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Ten more days!\" she murmured, and nestled closer, with her head on his\r\nbreast so that she could feel the strong beating of his heart.\r\n\r\n\"It says 'Avice!--Avice!--Avice!'\" he said quietly.  \"It is full of\r\nAvice,\" and she pressed still closer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the great day came, the greatest day either of their lives had known.\r\n\r\nWulf had found sleep impossible.  His heart, full-charged, felt like to\r\nburst its mortal bounds.  He rose quietly in the dark and went out into\r\nthe soft twilight of the dawn--to greet the coming of the perfect day.\r\nAnd she, as impossible of sleep as he, heard him in spite of all his\r\ncaution, and laughed softly to herself for very happiness in him and in\r\nherself.  And when he had gone, she thanked God for this great gift of\r\na true man's love, and for that in herself which responded to it so\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nShe had not a doubt nor a fear.  The smallest of either would have\r\nbarred her from him.  But there was not the smallest shadow between\r\nthem.  Their hearts were one.  It was meet and good that their lives\r\nshould be one also.  Wulfrey paced the beach out there and found the\r\nsilent darkness soothing to his bounding senses.\r\n\r\nIt was late April.  The air was sweet and fresh.  The sea just breathed\r\nin its sleep and no more.  The water rippled silently up the hard sand\r\nwith scarce a murmur.  The darkness of the eastern sky thinned as he\r\npaced and watched.  There came a soft suffusion of light there.  It\r\nthrobbed and grew.  A faint touch of carmine outlined a cloud above it.\r\nThe darkness seemed to fade and melt out of the sky.  All the tiny\r\nclouds above him turned their faces to the east and flushed rose-red\r\nwith the joy of the new day.\r\n\r\nHe climbed a hill and caught the first golden gleam of the rising sun.\r\nHis eyes shone, and his face.  In his eyes two suns were reflected.\r\nBut there was only one sun.  And they were two and now were to become\r\none.  The Perfect Day had dawned.\r\n\r\nAnd just as she, lying in her bed with her face in her hands, had\r\nthanked God for His goodness, so he.  He flung his right hand up\r\ntowards the sun in the brightening sky and said deeply, \"My God, I\r\nthank Thee for this day and most of all for her!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, down below, he saw her coming out of the house towards him.\r\n\r\nHe sprang down to meet her, caught her hands, and looked right down\r\nthrough her eyes into her heart, and was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX\r\n\r\nArm in arm they paced the beach till the sun was well up, and their\r\nbank of sand shone in the flood of golden light as it had never shone\r\nbefore,--fresh and sweet as if but new-created.\r\n\r\nA light wind had come with the sun.  The small waves came hurrying in\r\nas though they were invited guests.  At sight of the wedding-party they\r\nbroke into crisp white laughter, curled themselves over in league-long\r\nsickles of tenderest lucent green, and raced up the sands to their feet\r\nin long soft swirls of liquid amber, laced with bubbles and edged with\r\ncreamy foam.\r\n\r\n\"They haste to the wedding, to pay their tribute to the only bride they\r\nhave ever set eyes on,\" said Wulf, as they stopped to watch them.  \"And\r\neach one is glad to give his life for a single peep at her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish little waves,\" laughed she.  \"I am going to make their very\r\nclose acquaintance presently.  How beautiful the sea is this\r\nmorning!\"--as her eyes travelled out to the wide blue sweep beyond,\r\nwith its dapple of purple shadows.\r\n\r\n\"The most beautiful sea and the most wonderful morning that ever was,\"\r\nhe asserted heartily.  \"But it is only a beginning.  There will be many\r\nmore like it.  And still better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad it is so sweet a day.  A dull one would have troubled me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it could not possibly have been anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but it could.\"\r\n\r\n\"In mere outward accident perhaps.  But I've got the sun inside me.  I\r\nwonder it doesn't show through.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does,\" she laughed joyously.  \"You are all aglow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And never man had better reason.  I would not change places with all\r\nthe kings of all the earth rolled into one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I with all the queens.  We are happier here by far with nothing\r\nbut ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ourselves, and our Love, and infinite Hope.  Now let us go and eat.\r\nMy bride must not starve.  That would be a bad beginning.  Did you\r\nsleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a wink.  I heard you go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I was pluming myself on not having made a sound.\"\r\n\r\nWhile she was making cakes he busied himself making a pen out of a\r\nquill he had picked up on the beach, and she smiled when she saw what\r\nhe was at.\r\n\r\n\"And the ink?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it all ready.  I always carry some with me in case of need,\"\r\nat which she knitted her brows prettily and looked puzzled.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast she said, \"Now you must leave me for a couple of hours.\r\nI am going to thank the waves for their good wishes and then I shall go\r\nto the fresh-water pool.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be very careful..  You won't get yourself drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be very careful.  And you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go across to the spit.  But when we are wed----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--then!\" she nodded rosily, and he kissed her and went off past the\r\nfresh-water pools, and splashed through the narrows that joined their\r\nlake to the smaller one, and so to the shore and into the sea, for the\r\nlast time alone.\r\n\r\nHe waited till he was sure she had done with their bathing-pool, and\r\nthen ran across and plunged into it, for the salt water braces, but\r\nsticks and never makes one feel so clean as fresh.\r\n\r\nShe was still busy with the princely brush and comb when he came on\r\nher, and his heart leaped again at her fresh and radiant beauty.\r\n\r\nShe had clothed herself all in spotless linen, swathed about her in\r\nthat marvellous fashion of which she held the secret to perfection.  To\r\nhis rejoicing eyes she appeared half angel, half Vestal Virgin, yet all\r\nbewitching human girl, and, best of all, his bride.\r\n\r\n\"Be thankful you're a man, and delivered from this,\" she said, her eyes\r\nshining through the glorious veil at his visible joy in her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thankful I'm a man, but I wouldn't have you relieved of that for\r\nhalf the world.  I glory in it,\" and he bent and kissed it.  \"For a\r\nmoment I thought you were an angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you are.  But, thank God, you're human too!  Men don't wed with\r\nangels....  I must go and dress myself also,\" and he disappeared into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nWhen, in due course, he came out, gallantly clad in a long blue coat\r\nwith flap-pockets, and figured vest, and white silk knee-breeches, and\r\nstockings to suit, she first stared and then laughed.\r\n\r\n\"My faith, but we are fine!\" said she.  \"But, in truth, I like you best\r\nas I have known you best.  Do you marry in a dead man's clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I know it.  Sooner in my rags.  But, to the best of my belief,\r\nthese belonged to your friend the Duke of Kent.  Macro would have them,\r\nbut little he dreamed of the high use to which they would be put.  I\r\nborrow them for the occasion.  His Highness would make no objection I\r\nam sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure he would not, and they become you well.  But still I like\r\nyou best as I have known you best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will doff them presently.  But you are so like a queen that I did\r\nnot like to come to you like a beggar.\"\r\n\r\nIn his hand he had brought the Prayer-book, with the quill in a certain\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHe stepped up to her and lifted her hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"You do not repent you of this we are about to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never repent it,\" she said, with dancing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Please God, and as far as in me lies, you shall never have cause to\r\nrepent it....  We are here, our two selves, with none to witness this\r\nthat we do but God....  We are doing what we believe to be right for\r\nour own great happiness and well-being....  It would suffice, I\r\nbelieve, for a Scots wedding, simply to declare ourselves man and wife.\r\nBut I have thought it would please us both to do something more.  We\r\nare not entering upon this new estate lightly or without due\r\nthought....  It will, I know, be to both our minds and comforting to\r\nboth our hearts, to think that in our loneliness here we have done all\r\nwe could to supply the deficiencies for which we are not to blame.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with very great emotion.  She rejoiced in this fresh evidence\r\nof the heights and depths of his nature and his essential goodness of\r\nheart, though indeed she had not needed it.\r\n\r\nHer great dark eyes, fixed on his, were abrim with happy tears.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he continued, \"We will read together the Form for the\r\nSolemnization of Matrimony in this Prayer-book, and then we will\r\ninscribe on the front leaf of it the fact that this day we have become\r\nman and wife.  We will sign our names to it, and we can do no more to\r\ncomply with man's law....  Is that your will, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then here we will kneel and wed,\" and down they knelt in the sand,\r\nwith a clear sky and bright sun above, and the blue sea that held them\r\ncaptive dancing and laughing in front; and holding the book between\r\nthem he read the Service aloud in a deep and reverent voice.\r\n\r\nParts of it were of course somewhat incongruous to their situation, but\r\nhe would not slur or miss a word.  The statement that they were\r\ngathered together in the face of this congregation almost provoked her\r\nto an explosion.  For out of the corner of her eye, as she followed his\r\nreading, a slight movement on the side of an adjacent sandhill showed\r\nher a rabbit, sitting up and watching them with critical attention, and\r\nit looked to her just like the frowsy old female in black she had seen\r\nhovering about the skirts of a wedding in a London church.\r\n\r\nAnd there were parts that brought the colour to her face, though she\r\nwas familiar with them.  Applied to oneself they seemed to hold new\r\npoint and meaning.\r\n\r\nHowever, he read bravely on.  No one interfered to show any just cause\r\nwhy they should not lawfully be joined together, nor had either of them\r\nany confession of impediment to make.\r\n\r\nAt the \"Wilt thou----?\" he answered heartily, \"I will.\"  And waited for\r\nher to do the same when her turn came.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to--\"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\"--he\r\nanswered boldly,--\"God.\"\r\n\r\nThen they took hands and plighted their troth, reciting the words in\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nBut when it came to the putting on of the ring there came an interlude\r\nnot provided for in the Marriage Service.\r\n\r\nHe had duly provided a plain gold wedding ring.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" she asked with a look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I found it among Macro's treasures.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be some dead woman's, then.  I would sooner not.  Can we not\r\nleave that out?  Will it make any difference?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear.  It will make no difference to our being truly wed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then please go on without it.\"\r\n\r\nSo they left the ring out and read on to the end together.\r\n\r\nHe closed the book and drew her to him as they knelt, and kissed her as\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, lifting her up.  \"We will put on record the most\r\nwonderful thing that has ever happened on this island, and then we will\r\ngo home and prepare the marriage-feast....  I wonder now if James\r\nElwes, M.A., late of Brasenose College, Oxford, is aware of the high\r\nuse to which his Prayer-book is being put,\"--as he pointed to the name\r\ninscribed on the fly-leaf, and turned over to the blank on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see why not.  But as we never knew him, nor he us, it is\r\npossible he is not present.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly those words at the beginning of the Marriage Service\r\nassumed a new and mighty significance for her.  \"In the face of this\r\ncongregation\" might mean more than she had ever dreamed of.  Perhaps\r\nher mother had been there----  If she had, if she should be here\r\nnow--it, was somewhat startling to think of--she would be glad, for she\r\nwould know how good and true a man this was.\r\n\r\nBut he was busily writing, and at the sight she cried, \"Oh!\"--for the\r\nwriting was red and the ink was drawn from a little jag he had made in\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\n\"In blood,\" she said, with a touch of dismay.\r\n\r\n\"It could not be put to better use,\" he laughed.  \"It is all at your\r\nservice ... to the very last drop....  How begin better than by setting\r\ndown here that we are one till death?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you said made me think that perhaps my mother had been with\r\nus----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure she was, and mine too....  They will both approve, you may\r\nbe sure....  Here is what I have written--\r\n\r\n\"'I, Wulfrey Dale, do hereby declare that I have this day taken Avice\r\nDrummond to be my lawful wedded wife.'  And for you, 'I, Avice\r\nDrummond, do hereby declare that I have this day taken Wulfrey Dale to\r\nbe my lawful wedded husband.'  Now I will sign....  And you will sign\r\nthere ... and I will add the date as far as we know it ... and our\r\npresent place of abode--Sable Island.\"\r\n\r\nHe held the book till the writing was dry, then kissed her signature.\r\n\"It is the first time I have set eyes on your handwriting,\" he said.\r\n\"It is like yourself--clear and strong and true ... Mistress\r\nDale,\"--with a smiling bow, as he handed her the book,--\"your\r\nmarriage-lines!  You will like to keep them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the pen, please,\" she said, holding out her hand for it, and\r\nwrapping it and the book in a fold of her white robe.  \"These will be\r\nmore to me than all the treasures of the world.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her and they went slowly home--man and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nGARDEN OF EDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI\r\n\r\nHappy?  If all newly-married folk could find such happiness as was\r\ntheirs, what a wonderful world it would be!\r\n\r\nFrom every worldly point of view they had nothing.  They were outcasts,\r\npaupers, dependent for the food they ate and the clothes they wore, on\r\nNature and the caprice of the sea.  Yet, having nothing, they had\r\neverything, since they had one another.\r\n\r\nIf he had rejoiced in her before, and loved her with a love akin to\r\npain in the repression he subjected it to, he loved her now a thousand\r\ntimes more, and she filled him with a joy that knew no bounds.  Time,\r\nhe said to himself, would not suffice for all their love, it would fill\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nThe days were never long enough for them.  In this new joy of life and\r\nperfected fellowship they forgot their years at times, and were like a\r\npair of children, endowed with the freedom of time and space and hearts\r\nattuned to the most perfect enjoyment of these new attributes.\r\n\r\nThey made long journeys and explored every inch of their\r\nterritory--sleeping out at times in the side of a sandhill under the\r\nsoft summer night.  And those were wondrous times.\r\n\r\n--To lie there flat on their blanket, side by side, chin in hand like\r\nchildren, his arm about her, and watch the red sun sink into the water\r\nat the end of his fiery trail, while all the sky above burned crimson\r\nright into the east behind them.--To watch, with bated breath, the\r\nrabbits creeping out to feed and frolic about them, all unconscious of\r\ntheir presence.--To lie and watch the colours fade slowly in the\r\ndarkening sky, and the stars come out till the whole dark dome was a\r\nnever-failing marvel of delight.--Or, on the other shore, to lie and\r\nwatch the moonbeams dancing on the sleeping bosom of the sea.--To feel\r\noneself oneself in the midst of it all--a part of it all--the height\r\nand the width and the immensity and wonder of it all.--To feel his arm\r\nenfolding her, and all that that meant to them both.--To feel the\r\nwarmth of life, and all the mighty joy of it, throbbing in her slender\r\nbody as he drew her closer.--To know, as he knew, that God lived and\r\nhad given her to him, and that she loved him with every fibre of her\r\nbeing, as he loved her....\r\n\r\nHappy?  At times, so full was her heart that she wondered if such\r\nhappiness was right for mortals to enjoy, and so, if it could last.\r\n\r\nAnd when she shared that with him, as they shared everything in common,\r\nhe reasoned her back to comfort.\r\n\r\n\"Happiness and health are life's proper conditions,\" he asserted, with\r\nsuch hearty conviction that her doubts hid their heads.  \"Sorrow and\r\nsickness come of trespass, somehow, somewhere, somewhen, though it is\r\nnot always easy to trace them back to first causes.  But, without\r\ndoubt, people were meant to be as healthy and happy as it is possible\r\nfor them to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have known people suffer who, I am sure, never did any\r\nwrong--none, that is, deserving of suffering such as they had.  In\r\nfact,\" she mused, \"it seems to me that the good people suffer most and\r\nthe wicked prosper.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as we judge.  But we see only the outsides of things and we\r\nare purblind at best.  Nature has certain laws, and God has certain\r\nlaws--though a parson could tell you more about these than I can.  And\r\nif those laws are broken the results have to be borne, and sometimes\r\nthey run on and on and fall on innocent people.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem very fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"The laws cannot be altered for individuals or exceptional cases.\r\nFathers sin and the children suffer.  But the blame is the fathers'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she nodded, and perhaps she was thinking of her own case.\r\n\r\n\"So you've no need to fear being as happy as you can,\" he added\r\nquickly.  \"God meant you for happiness, and truly, I think we have more\r\ncertainty of it here than we might have had elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it and I am happy,\" and she nestled still closer under\r\nhis folding arm.\r\n\r\nBut they had their strenuous working times as well, and enjoyed them\r\nequally.  He developed his new-found capacity for carpentering.  Made\r\nher more chairs and a table, added to the comfort of their house in\r\nmany ways.  And she kept it all in perfect order, and attended to the\r\ncooking, and proved herself a most admirable housewife and helpmate.\r\n\r\nThey were down almost to fundamentals.  Their life--partaking as it did\r\nof the development of the ages, and so of the wider freedom of thought\r\nand feeling, was the life of the ancients and not far from idyllic.\r\n\r\nThe hunter went forth to the chase--though it was only rabbits--and the\r\nfisherman to the lake, and brought home his spoils to his waiting mate,\r\nand they ate of them and were content.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed the most perfect health, and for society they had one\r\nanother and desired no more--at all events, no outsiders.\r\n\r\nThey had storms and mists and spells of dull weather, but their house\r\nwas proof against all assault from without, and warm and bright with\r\ntheir abounding love.  They had fire and light and books and\r\nthemselves, and always in time the sun shone out again, and they\r\nenjoyed it the more perhaps for its frequent defaults.\r\n\r\nThey had their trying times too.  Stores had to be replenished from the\r\npile, and, after that dreadful experience before they were married, she\r\nwould not be left behind.\r\n\r\n\"I do not care what happens if we are together,\" she said.  \"The worst\r\nthat could happen would be nothing compared with that other time,\" and\r\nhe could not gainsay her.\r\n\r\nSo whenever he had to go she went also, and they chose their day with\r\ncare and made a picnic of it, and came home laden with spoils.\r\n\r\nOnly once they got caught by one of those swift-travelling mists which\r\nseemed to spring from nowhere.  It swept over them just as they were\r\npreparing to leave, and in the twinkling of an eye they were prisoners,\r\nbound clammily to the pile till it should pass.  For in that\r\nclose-clinging bank, as thick as wet cotton-wool, all sense of\r\ndirection was gone in a moment.  They could not see a foot before them,\r\nthe pile was pitted with death-traps, a step might be fatal.\r\n\r\nThey had both come lightly clad, for the day had been warm and the\r\nwreckage claimed unhampered limbs.\r\n\r\nFortunately they had come upon a case of blankets during their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\"Sit you down here,\" he said, as he felt her shivering under his arm,\r\n\"And I'll get you some blankets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't get yourself lost?\" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you will keep calling to me,\" and he crawled away in search of\r\nthe case, while she sat calling, \"Wulf ... Wulf ... Wulf,\" and he\r\nanswered her, \"Avice ... Avice ... Avice,\" and at last a shout, \"I've\r\ngot it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd presently his muffled \"Avice ... Avice ... Avice,\" drew near again,\r\nand he loomed through the fog like a creeping ghost, and taking her arm\r\nthey crept together from blanket to blanket, which he had spread as a\r\nguide, till they came to the case itself.  He hauled out more of its\r\ncontents till there was room inside for both of them, and they crawled\r\ninto their nest and in time got warm and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe fog showed no sign of lifting, so before it got quite dark he\r\ncrawled out again, she calling to him as before, and found a cask of\r\nrum, of which there was always plenty about, and one of pork, and on\r\nthese they supped as best they could.\r\n\r\nThe writhing and creaking of the pile, as the tide rose and fell,\r\ncaused her some alarm.  But he explained it all to her, and after a\r\ntime she fell asleep with his arm about her, and they were wakened to a\r\nclear bright morning by the shrieking and squabbling of the birds over\r\nthe barrel of pork, which he had left standing open.\r\n\r\nThe barrel itself and all the pile adjacent seemed suddenly to have\r\nsprouted feathers.  It was alive with fiercely-beating wings and\r\njerking feathered necks and squirming feathered bodies, and cold hard\r\nlittle glassy eyes, and cruel rending beaks, and shrill angry cries.\r\n\r\n\"How hideous they are!\" she said, shrinking back into the case.\r\n\r\n\"It is the great fight for life.  They seem always hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThe barrel stood on end.  The fortunate ones among the feathered\r\npirates wormed themselves in, and tore and rent at the food, regardless\r\nof the shrill expostulations of their fellows and the beaks and claws\r\nthat tore and rent at them in turn, till the barrel itself was lost\r\nunder a seething mass of shrieking, fiercely-struggling birds.  They\r\npecked at one another's glassy eyes, they struck wildly with their\r\nwings, they clawed with somewhat futile feet, and all the time screamed\r\nat the tops of their voices as though they were trying who could scream\r\nthe loudest.\r\n\r\n\"I wish they'd empty it and go,\" said she, and he wrenched down a slat\r\nof wood and leaned out with a blanket over his head and arm, and\r\nsucceeded at last in tipping the barrel over, and pork and pirates\r\nrolled out together.\r\n\r\nIt was all cleaned up in five minutes and the cloud drifted away after\r\nother prey.  The disappointed ones swooped round the empty barrel for a\r\ntime, and some of the bolder, or more hungry, or least intelligent,\r\ncame fluttering at the opening in the blanket-box as though set on\r\nfresh meat at any cost, and he had to beat them back with his slat.  It\r\nwas only when a score or more were flopping brokenly about the pile in\r\nfront of the box that the rest grew tired of so losing a game and sped\r\naway to join the main body.  As soon as the way was clear, he helped\r\nher out of her nest and they got to their raft, and eventually safely\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nBut that was only an incident, though it confirmed her dislike and\r\ndread of the pile.  She still always insisted on going with him when he\r\nhad to go, and at such times they laboured long and hard, and got in\r\nsupplies enough for many weeks, and so went out there as seldom as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII\r\n\r\nSo, working, wandering, bathing, reading, hunting, fishing, eating,\r\nsleeping, with hearts and minds stripped bare to one another and every\r\nthought in common, they lived that first golden year of their married\r\nlife, and grew into still closer fellowship and communion, into still\r\nclearer understanding of one another, into still greater\r\nlove,--although, at the beginning, all this would have seemed to them\r\nimpossible.  But there are always heights and depths beyond, and will\r\nbe, until the final heights are scaled--and doubtless even then also.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to one such depth and height they were drawing near, with a\r\ntouch of not unnatural fear on her part, as to an experience unknown\r\nand invested with all the possibilities of life and death, and new life.\r\n\r\nHe cheered her with his own great confidence; and her reliance on his\r\nprofessional knowledge, and the love he bore her, comforted her\r\nmightily.  But they both knew full well that, given all the knowledge\r\nand love in the world, the certain issue of this great matter still lay\r\nbeyond the utmost power of man; and it sent them to their knees and\r\nbrought them nigher heaven than ever in their lives before.\r\n\r\nIt also set her very busily to work on tiny garments, which she had to\r\ncontrive as best she could from her very scant materials.  And it set\r\nhim to the making of a cradle out of a very carefully-cleaned and\r\nsand-scrubbed pork-barrel, which turned out an immense success and\r\nfilled him with great pride of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nShe was in the very best of health, without a trouble on her mind, and\r\nrejoicing more than ever in his joy and pride in her.  And these and\r\nthe free open-air life they led all made for good.  He would not permit\r\nher a despondent thought, though as the time drew near she not seldom,\r\nfor his sake, assumed a braver and more cheerful aspect than her heart\r\nactually warranted.\r\n\r\nBut all went well, and within a day or two of the anniversary of their\r\nwedding-day, their son, Wulfrey, was born and proved himself at once a\r\ntrue Islander, lusty both of lung and limb.\r\n\r\nProuder and happier father and mother, and more wonderful baby, it is\r\nsafe to say that island never saw.  And if their days had been full of\r\ndelight before, the coming of Little Wulf filled them quite three times\r\nas full.  For there was Little Wulf's own happiness, which was patent\r\nto all,--and his mother's rapture in him, and his father's,--and his\r\nfather's mighty joy in them both,--and her joy in his joy,--and so on\r\nall round the compass;--and deep below and high above and all through\r\nit all, their unbounded thankfulness for safe deliverance from peril.\r\n\r\nIf he had admired and loved her as a maid, and loved and rejoiced in\r\nher as a wife,--as mother of his child he found himself at times dumb\r\nwith excess of delight.  He could only sit and watch, with worshipful\r\neyes, and newer and deeper thoughts of that other Mother, and of The\r\nChild whose coming had transformed the world.\r\n\r\nShe got out the treasured old Prayer-book, and they read over him as\r\nmuch as seemed applicable to his case of the Ministration of Private\r\nBaptism of Infants, and then inscribed on the fly-leaf, under the\r\nrecord of their marriage, his name, Wulfrey Drummond Dale, and the date\r\nof his birth as nearly as they knew it--with the same pen as before, in\r\nthe same red ink, and from the same glad source.\r\n\r\nAnd now indeed their days were full, and their nights, for Master\r\nWulfrey had an appetite that brooked no waiting, and he ruled that\r\nhousehold with a lusty pair of lungs against which even equinoctial\r\ngales strove in vain.\r\n\r\nBut it was all part of the price of their joy in him, and they paid it\r\njoyfully; and he repaid them tenfold by simply being alive and\r\npermitting them to watch his vigorous kickings as he lay naked on a\r\nblanket at their feet in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nAvice was speedily herself again, herself and so very much more.  In\r\nhis rejoicing eyes all her beauty was clarified, dignified, emphasised\r\nmanifold, in a way that he would not have believed possible.\r\n\r\nIt was his turn now, in spite of all his philosophy,--and at times hers\r\nagain also--to marvel at all that had been vouchsafed them, and to\r\nwonder, with a fleeting touch of fear, if happiness so great could\r\npossibly last.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the mighty responsibility their love entailed was upon\r\nthem.  Suppose, by any dire misfortune, he were to be taken away,--what\r\nwould happen to them?  He believed her capable of rising to the\r\noccasion for the boy's sake and doing man's work in his place, but it\r\nwould be a desperately hard fight for her.  Suppose they should be\r\ntaken from him--either, both.  God!--he could spare the boy best, but\r\nit would be terrible to lose either.\r\n\r\nAnd suppose, thought she in turn, either of themselves should be taken!\r\nSuppose they should both be taken!--Well, in that case the poor little\r\nfellow would linger behind but a very short time.  They would soon all\r\nbe together again.\r\n\r\nBut such black thoughts, natural as they were, inevitable almost, still\r\npartook, to both their minds, of basest ingratitude and lack of trust.\r\nAnd yet they did high service, for, when they came upon them their\r\nsouls went down on their knees, and there they found strength and\r\njoyousness again.\r\n\r\nLittle Wulf--but they very early began to call him Cubbie, it seemed so\r\nappropriate--fulfilled all the promise of his advent.  He was a\r\nmarvellous child.  He crawled vigorously at nine months, and headed\r\nstraight across the soft yellow sand for the water, like a true\r\nIslander, born of freedom and the open air and the sunshine, the moment\r\nhe discovered this new power.  And they followed him, foot by foot,\r\nwith beaming faces, as he wallowed along like a well-developed white\r\nfrog, digging his little snub nose into the sand at times, but gurgling\r\nand laughing all the same, and struggling on without a look to right or\r\nleft, intent only on the water in front.\r\n\r\nAt the lip of the tide, where it came creaming up the beach in long\r\nsoft swirls of amber, laced with bubbles and edged with filmy foam, she\r\nwas for snatching him up.  But Wulf stayed her.  He wanted to see what\r\nthe boy would do.\r\n\r\nHe was no stranger to cold water, but he had so far met it only in a\r\ntub, never in such quantity as this.  He crawled on along the wet sand\r\nand the soft swirl came rushing up to welcome him.  It was quite two\r\ninches deep.  It filled him with astonishment and took away his breath.\r\nEverything under him seemed on the move.  He stiffened for a second on\r\nhis front paws, gave a huge bellow of amazement, tried to grab the\r\nback-streaming water with both hands as a cat pounces on a mouse, and\r\nthen set off after it at top speed, and was swung up into the air by\r\nhis delighted father, and held there, kicking and crowing, and striving\r\nstill after the enchanted water below.\r\n\r\n\"He'll do,\" laughed Wulf.  \"He'll swim as soon as he can walk.  The\r\nfirst native!  And a credit to the Island!\"\r\n\r\nGolden days!  If the first year of their married life was all pure\r\ngold, this second was gold overlaid with jewels of rare delight.  Every\r\nmoment of it was happiness unalloyed.  The boy throve mightily.  Avice\r\nwas in the best of health and spirits, and to the eyes of her lover\r\ngrew more beautiful with every day that passed.\r\n\r\nWhat more could the soul of man desire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII\r\n\r\nTheir Wulf Cub was fifteen months old, and could swim like a fish, and\r\nrun like a free-born savage, and talk in a jargon of his own which was\r\nyet quite understandable to his parents, when his sister Avice came on\r\nthe scene.  She took after her mother, and her father vowed there never\r\nhad been such a lovely child born into this world before.\r\n\r\nTheir patriarchal life flowed on, deepening and widening, as it went,\r\nand so far without any break in its smooth-swelling current.  The great\r\ngales, to which they had grown accustomed, piled up ever-increasing\r\nsupplies for them.  Within certain narrow bounds they knew no lack, nor\r\nwould they though they lived there for a hundred years.  On great\r\noccasions the wreckage even yielded them luxuries of the commonplace\r\nwhich in the former life they had looked upon as ordinary adjuncts to a\r\nmeal and accepted perfunctorily, without a thought of special\r\nthankfulness.  But here they were rarities, priceless delicacies to be\r\nheld in esteem and made the most of.  Apples for example.  Once their\r\nwestern point was strewn thick with what seemed a whole ship-load of\r\ndelicious red apples.  They had probably been packed in frail barrels\r\nor cases which the waves made short work of, and the birds were\r\nfortunately away.  They spent days carrying them up above tide-level\r\nand then transporting them home, and revelled in apples for weeks till\r\ntheir stock went bad.  Another time it was potatoes, which they had not\r\ntasted for over three years.  Wulf declared it was almost worth while\r\nto have been denied them so long, to find such new relish in them now.\r\nAvice regretted, for the children's sakes, that they could not have\r\nthem all the time.\r\n\r\nAnd that set him to planting a quantity in some of the damp bottoms by\r\nthe water-pools.  They came up all right, but the rabbits cleared the\r\ngreen shoots as fast as they appeared.  Upon that he fenced off a patch\r\nwith some of his superfluous raft timber and planted more, and\r\nsucceeded in raising a small crop, but they were a degenerate race,\r\nlacking the good soil which had gone to the making of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, that fact started into expression trains of thought\r\nthat had been latent in both their minds.\r\n\r\nHe had come in exultantly with his first fruits of the potato-patch,\r\nCubbie at his heels proudly bearing one in each hand, and Avice cooked\r\nthem rejoicingly and pronounced them excellent.\r\n\r\n\"It will be so delightful to have potatoes again,\" said she.\r\n\r\nBut he was critical of his own production, as the author of a\r\nwork--even though it be but a potato--may be allowed to be.  \"They have\r\nneither the texture nor the flavour of the original stock,\" he said.\r\n\"I suppose they need better soil than our old sandbank can afford\r\nthem,\"--and his eyes happened to fall on Cubbie munching away at a\r\npotato, and hers lighted on the dark little head in her arm.  The same\r\nthought pricked both their hearts and their eyes met with understanding.\r\n\r\nAs with potatoes--so with children.  He and she, growths of the larger\r\nworld, had found unlooked-for happiness through the accident of their\r\ntransplantation to this outer isle.  But they brought with them the\r\nstrength of heart and mind that had come to them through contact with\r\nthat other world.  In many respects it was a vain and hollow world.\r\nThe change had made entirely for their good and happiness.\r\n\r\nBut--these little ones! ... Were they to be condemned for ever to the\r\nsweet narrow groove of this island life, which to their father and\r\nmother, by reason of the wonder of their love, had been like Paradise?\r\n\r\nTo the children no such transformation, no such veritable\r\ntransfiguration of life as had been theirs would be possible.\r\n\r\nThey could, indeed, teach them all they knew themselves--all the\r\nessentials at all events.  They could train their hearts and brains to\r\nhighest things.  But in time the children would feel what the island\r\nlife entailed and denied them--what their lives were missing.  The\r\nhigher their development the keener would be their regrets.\r\n\r\n\"Dear,\" he said, clasping her closer, as she lay in the hollow of his\r\narm before the fire that night, \"I know what you are thinking.  It came\r\non me, and it came to you, when I was criticising those degenerate\r\npotatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it must have been lurking somewhere in my heart,\" she said\r\nquietly.  \"But it all came on me with a rush as you spoke.  You and I\r\ndesire no better.  It has been wonderful ... perfect happiness.  But\r\nfor them....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said soberly.  \"For them it would be different.  For them we\r\ndesire the very best.  And here they cannot get it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they were face to face with the mighty problem which thenceforth\r\nmust of necessity be constantly in their minds and hearts.\r\n\r\nFor themselves, all that the outside world could give them could add no\r\nwhit to their perfect content and happiness.\r\n\r\nBut for the children's sakes ... how to cross that treacherous hundred\r\nmiles of sea which barred the way to the wider--in some respects\r\nwider,--to the larger--in some respects larger,--to the questionably\r\nhappier life, which yet these newcomers must prove for themselves, as\r\nwas their right?\r\n\r\nThey discussed it quietly and at great length that night, but could see\r\nno way out, and for the moment he could find no further comfort for her\r\nthan this--and yet it was much,--\"Providence, which has done so much\r\nfor us,\" said he, \"may in time do this also.  Meanwhile the Island life\r\nis all to the good for them.  They are splendid little specimens, and\r\nif they run wild and free for some years they will reap the benefit all\r\ntheir lives.  We will hope and pray, and puzzle our brains for them.\"\r\n\r\nHope they did.  And pray they did.  But no amount of brain-puzzling\r\nafforded them any solution of their difficulty.\r\n\r\nNothing in the shape of a boat had ever come ashore, and he had neither\r\nthe tools nor the skill to build one.  And if he had done he would not\r\nhave dared to risk his wife and children in it for so doubtful a voyage.\r\n\r\nWild ideas came upon him of constructing a raft stout enough for such a\r\njourney and venturing on it himself, leaving Avice and the children,\r\nfully provided for, to await his return with succour.  But he knew she\r\nwould never hear of such madness, so sent it to limbo with the rest.\r\n\r\nHe took to lighting huge fires of timber from the pile, as he had done\r\nmore than once before, but the wood burned brightly, with splendid\r\ncrackings and spittings which set Master Cubbie dancing with delight,\r\nand the volume of smoke was trifling.  It occurred to Wulf also that no\r\nmatter how dense a smoke he could raise it would, if seen at all, be\r\nprobably taken only for the cloud of sea-birds which were doubtless\r\nknown to mariners and avoided like death itself--when avoidance was\r\npossible to them.\r\n\r\nThat every ship that could do so kept well away from their notorious\r\nbank was evident, for they had never set eyes on a single sail since\r\nthey landed.  Of course their ordinary range from the level could not\r\nbe more than four or five miles, he supposed; and even from their\r\nhighest hill, which he reckoned to be sixty to eighty feet, they would\r\nsee but twice as far;--and nothing came so close to Sable Island as\r\nthat if it could help it.\r\n\r\nStill wilder ideas he had,--of tying messages to some of the birds'\r\nlegs--but they were such a vicious set that he knew they would get rid\r\nof them at once,--of nailing messages to boards, to empty casks, to\r\nanything that would float--but he knew they might float for a score of\r\nyears and never be found, even if the seas did not strip them within a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nHe was reduced at last to that certainty of knowledge which it is\r\nalways of highest benefit to man to attain,--that in this matter he was\r\nas helpless as a child in arms.  He could do absolutely nothing that\r\nwas of the slightest avail.  And so he was thrown back upon, and led\r\nand lifted up to, that complete and perfect trust in a Higher Power\r\nwhich is the measure of a man's understanding of the great lesson of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV\r\n\r\nThey had been five years on the Island.  Little Wulf was three, Avice\r\ntwo,--as healthy and handsome youngsters as the world could show.\r\n\r\nLife had been all joyous to them.  All the year round, except just now\r\nand again when unusual drift of ice came rustling and grinding about\r\ntheir island, they trotted about with almost nothing on.  They swam\r\nbefore they could walk, and now were in and out of the water a dozen\r\ntimes a day, and so they regarded clothing of any kind as a hindrance\r\nto pure enjoyment and freedom of action, and their mother judged it\r\nwell to insist on no more than the most reasonable minimum.\r\n\r\nThey never lacked friends or company, though truly the friendship was\r\nmostly on their side and provokingly lacking in mutuality.  Rabbits and\r\nseals, especially baby-rabbits and baby-seals, were the chiefest\r\nobjects of their young affections, and they were sorely disappointed at\r\nthe small response their proffered friendship evoked.  On crabs this\r\ncould be enforced by capture and imprisonment, but they found them\r\ncold-blooded, impassive playfellows, of altogether too-retiring\r\ndispositions, and only to be stirred into display of their natural\r\nabilities by provocation.  Sea-birds were just as bad in a different\r\nway, and fishes were altogether too elusive until you wanted to eat\r\nthem, when a baited hook did the trick in a moment.\r\n\r\nThat wonderful father of theirs, however, managed to capture a pair of\r\nbaby-rabbits, whose mother he had unfortunately knocked on the head for\r\ndinner before he perceived the mischief he was doing.  The babies were\r\nwelcomed with shrieks of delight and were like to be killed with the\r\nexpression of it.  The youngsters spent hours flat on their stomachs\r\nwatching them in their boarded enclosure alongside the house, and more\r\nhours foraging for them the sweetest and tenderest herbs the hollows\r\ncould yield.  And presently the captives became friends, and were so\r\ncomfortable in their narrow estate that they had no desire for a wider,\r\nbut galloped about after their owners wherever they went, and sat\r\nanxiously twisting their noses on the beach when the irrepressibles\r\nfound it necessary to wallow and frolic in the water.\r\n\r\nAt times, for a change, they lived aboard the 'Jane and Mary' for a\r\nweek or two, but Mistress Avice always had a very reasonable fear of\r\none or other or both of the children tumbling overboard, and so the\r\ngreater part of their life was passed ashore, with the sand-house as\r\nheadquarters and all the rest of the island as playground.\r\n\r\nThat a life so circumscribed should never have grown monotonous tells\r\nits own pleasant story.  But the youngsters had known no other life\r\nwith which to compare it, and their elders, who had, found it fuller\r\nand sweeter in its pastoral simplicity than any the great world had\r\never offered them.\r\n\r\nEvery moment of their day was occupied, if not with work, then with\r\nenjoyments.  The elders had to provide for the youngsters, and these\r\nagain for theirs; and when every single thing must be drawn from Nature\r\nor from an accommodating but distant wreck-pile, such provision takes\r\ntime and forethought.\r\n\r\nWhen the day's work was completed they all bathed and rambled far and\r\nwide, and it was on one such ramble, when they had gone as far along\r\ntowards the eastern end of the Island as small legs could carry, that\r\nthe end came--as suddenly as had come the beginning.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on the sunny side of a great sand-hill, eating and\r\nresting after their journey,--resting, that is, so far as the elders\r\nwere concerned.  The youngsters, who had found walking tiring, or\r\nperhaps tiresome, found no fatigue in scrambling to the tops of\r\nsandhills and sliding down the smooth soft sides with shouts and\r\nshrieks of laughter.\r\n\r\nA cessation in the sport drew their father's and mother's eyes to them.\r\nThey were both standing on the hill-top gazing eagerly out to sea and\r\nchattering to one another.\r\n\r\n\"Seals probably,\" said their mother.  From where they sat they could\r\nnot see the shore for an intervening ridge.  And seals were always a\r\nmighty attraction to the children.\r\n\r\nBut when they began dancing excitedly on their hill-top their father\r\ncalled, \"What is it you see, Cubbie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somefing, dad!  Somefing funny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somefing funny!\" repeated little Avice eagerly, and the elders got up\r\nlazily and slowly climbed the hillside to see what it was.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" said Wulfrey, as his eyes cleared the top first, and he\r\nturned and kissed his wife joyously.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" she breathed deeply, as her eyes also lighted on that\r\nwhich was coming.\r\n\r\nFor there, not half a mile away, was a white boat manned by blue\r\nsailors, leaping towards the shore as fast as eight lusty oars could\r\ndrive her, and out beyond her, probably three miles away, was a\r\nwhite-sailed ship of size.\r\n\r\nWulfrey shouted and waved his arms.  The children immediately did the\r\nsame, and the regular rise and fall of the oars stopped suddenly as\r\nevery eye in the boat turned on them.  There were men in the stern with\r\ngilt on their hats.  Then the oars fell-to again and the boat came\r\nbounding on.  Wulfrey and Avice picked up each their namesakes, and\r\nplunged down the hill and ran round the ridge to the shore.\r\n\r\nWith a final lunge the boat came up the beach, and a tall man rose in\r\nthe stern and asked, \"Who, in heaven's name, are you, and what are you\r\ndoing here?\"--while nine pairs of eager eyes raked over the little\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"I am Dr Wulfrey Dale, of Hazelford in Cheshire.  This is my wife--and\r\nour children.  We have been here five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!  Five years!\"--he was ashore by this time, and the rest\r\ntumbled hastily out and stood about them, the burly sailors listening\r\nwith one ear and trying to make up to the children, who gazed with\r\nwondering awe at the only men they had ever seen except their father.\r\n\"How on earth have you lived? ... Five years! ... Not all of you,\" he\r\nsaid with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Not all of us.  The children were born here.  We were afraid we would\r\nall have to live and die here.  I thank God you are come.  What brought\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been sent to prospect with a view to a lighthouse here.  There\r\nhas been an outcry about the number of wrecks----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, there are hundreds over yonder,\" said Wulfrey, pointing westward.\r\n\"They have kept us alive, but the cost to others has been heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and I'll show you--or will you take us along in the boat?  It's\r\ngood four miles over that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boat'll be easiest.  Sand's heavy walking.  How long can we count on\r\nthis weather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for a week at least.  It's our best time of year.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will take us home?\" asked Avice eagerly, when they had climbed\r\ninto the boat and were swinging along parallel to the shore, the\r\nchildren staring in a vast silence and with rounded eyes at the bearded\r\nsailor-men and their amazing ways.\r\n\r\n\"As far as our service permits, madame, we will do anything and\r\neverything you wish.  We return to Halifax in Nova Scotia, but once\r\nthere you will have no difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is where we want to go,\" said Wulfrey....  \"Better keep out a bit\r\nhere.  There are ridges below there....  Now if you will turn in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?  A ship?\" asked the tall man, and all eyes shot round to\r\nthe bare poles of the 'Jane and Mary' snowing over the sandhills.\r\n\r\n\"A schooner, land-locked in a lagoon.  That was our first home.  Now we\r\nlive ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've been all alone all that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had one companion, the mate of the ship....  He died four years\r\nago.  Since then none have come but the dead....  We can get in here, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat ran softly up the beach again, the sailors carried out Avice\r\nand the children, and they all struck up through the sandhills to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY WILLIAM BRENDON AND SON, LTD.\r\n\r\nPLYMOUTH, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  WORKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n  GOD'S PRISONER\r\n  RISING FORTUNES\r\n  OUR LADY OF DELIVERANCE\r\n  A PRINCESS OF VASCOVY\r\n  JOHN OF GERISAU\r\n  UNDER THE IRON FLAIL\r\n  BONDMAN FREE\r\n  MR.
