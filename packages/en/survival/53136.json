Of this\r\nspecies there are now described about 400 varieties which are\r\nsufficiently distinct to be considered by the student and the practical\r\nhorticulturist. The intending planter should study the character of the\r\nvarieties more closely than has hitherto been customary in this country,\r\nthough his safest plan is, of course, to plant in quantity only such\r\nvarieties as have proved valuable in his own locality, or where soil and\r\nclimate are similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n       NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE FLOWERS AND FRUIT OF THE FIG.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider these different varieties, a few remarks on the\r\nnature and structure of the fruit are necessary. The fig which we eat is\r\nreally a receptacle, on the surface of which are situated the numerous\r\nflowers. But as this surface is concave, or curved inwardly, like the\r\nhollow of a closed hand, the flowers can not be seen except when the fig\r\nis cut. Then it becomes apparent that the chamber formed by the curved\r\nreceptacle communicates with the outside by means of the “eye” at its\r\napex. In some varieties the “eye” is almost closed, opening only when\r\nthe fig has reached a certain age; in others it is so large that a pea\r\ncould easily pass through. The flowers are always more or less fleshy,\r\nare generally imperfect, and do not much resemble the bright flowers of\r\nother fruit trees and plants in our gardens. There are four distinct\r\nkinds of fig flowers, but these are not always found in a single fig, in\r\nfact they are rarely all found together. They are designated as follows:\r\n\r\n_Male flowers._—These possess four pollen-producing stamens. They are\r\nfound only in the wild or “caprifig,” the ancestor of our cultivated\r\nfigs, and in a very few varieties of edible figs.\r\n\r\n_Female flowers._—These possess a single style, stigma, and ovary, and\r\nwhen fertilized, produce seeds. Owing to the absence of male flowers, or\r\nthe failure of the male and female flowers in the same fig to mature at\r\nthe same time, they rarely produce fertile seeds unless fertilized by\r\npollen carried by insects.\r\n\r\n_Gall flowers._—These are degenerate female flowers which do not produce\r\nseeds, the abortive ovary serving only for the habitation and breeding\r\nplace of a very small wasp, the _Blastophaga_, which is used in\r\ncaprification. The gall flowers are found only in the original wild fig.\r\n\r\n_Mule flowers._—These are imperfect female flowers, incapable of\r\nproducing seeds or of affording a breeding place for the wasp. These\r\nflowers are found to the exclusion of all others in most of our\r\ncultivated figs.\r\n\r\nBecause of these differences in the flowers the numerous varieties of\r\nedible figs may be divided into tribes or subspecies. These are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n              CLASSIFICATION OF VARIETIES OF EDIBLE FIGS.\r\n\r\n_Caprifigs_ (_goat figs or wild figs_).—These figs grow wild in southern\r\nEurope, northern Africa, and western Asia, and have been recently\r\nintroduced into California. They bear all the kinds of flowers except\r\nthe _mule_ flowers, and as they are the only figs bearing _male_ flowers\r\nthey are essential in all fig districts where mature and fertile seeds\r\nare of importance, or in other words, where caprification is necessary.\r\n\r\n_Smyrna figs._—These are grown only in the Smyrna district of Asia\r\nMinor. They have only female flowers, and neither these latter nor the\r\nreceptacle on which they grow will come to any maturity without\r\ncaprification or pollination. So-called Smyrna figs, which have been\r\nbought of nurserymen, have generally proved spurious, as, unlike the\r\ntrue Smyrna figs, they mature their fruit without pollination. Of late\r\nyears true Smyrna figs have been planted in California, but they have\r\nfailed to ripen fruit except when artificially pollinated. These will\r\nnot produce ripe fruit in commercial quantities until caprification can\r\nbe practiced, and neither these nor the caprifig should be planted at\r\nthe present time, except for experimental purposes.\r\n\r\n_Common edible figs._—These are the common varieties of our orchards,\r\nwhich bear fruit and mature it with regularity without pollination or\r\ncaprification. They bear two crops a year, the “early figs” or “brebas,”\r\nand the later or “summer figs.” Of this tribe alone there are some 400\r\nvarieties described more or less perfectly, and probably as many more\r\nundescribed and unknown.\r\n\r\n_San Pedro figs._—This tribe contains only a few dozen varieties, some\r\nof which are cultivated in California, and also in Florida and other\r\nSouthern States. They are characterized by maturing only the first crop\r\nor “brebas.” The second crop always drops before reaching maturity. The\r\ncause of this is that the first crop contains only “mule flowers,” like\r\nthose of the common figs, while the second contains only “female\r\nflowers,” like those of the Smyrna figs.\r\n\r\nThe San Pedro tribe of fig varieties is specially valuable on account of\r\nthe large size and early maturity of the “brebas” or first crop. They\r\nshould, therefore, be planted only in places where it is desirable to\r\ngrow large, early figs, for marketing fresh. They do not succeed\r\neverywhere, as they require a warm and early spring climate.\r\n\r\nIn tropical countries there are numerous varieties of other species of\r\nfigs growing wild. Many of them are edible, but all are less palatable\r\nthan our edible fig, and with the exception of the Sycomore fig, _Ficus\r\nsycomorus_, of Africa, are of no economic importance except as food for\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, however, they are very useful, and the Sycomore fig\r\nshould be introduced into the Southern States, where it would probably\r\nthrive in frost-free localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n             VARIETIES OF FIGS FOUND USEFUL IN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nThe existing confusion regarding the names of the varieties of the fig\r\nis largely due to incomplete descriptions. The following points are of\r\nimportance in every fig description, and should always be noted: Size,\r\nform, neck, stalk, ribs, eye, color of skin, color of pulp, seeds,\r\nquality, growth, and leaf. In order to simplify descriptions, these\r\npoints should always be mentioned in the same order. It is also of great\r\nimportance to note whether the first crop alone matures fruit, and\r\nwhether the two crops differ materially in any of the above-mentioned\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nOf the 400 or more described varieties of figs, comparatively few have\r\nbeen tested in the United States. Most of those tested are French or\r\nhot-house varieties, very few southern or Mediterranean figs having been\r\nintroduced, though many of the latter are worthy of testing in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA few of the varieties that have been found most useful in California\r\nare described:\r\n\r\nADRIATIC.—Size medium, roundish; neck medium, stalk short; ribs obscure;\r\neye open, with red iris; skin very thin, greenish in the shade,\r\nyellowish in the sun; pulp bright strawberry red or with violet streaks\r\nin the meat; varies in quality according to location.\r\n\r\nThis has been found very useful in California, but is not of fine flavor\r\nwhen dried. It requires rich soil, with considerable moisture and a very\r\nlarge percentage of lime. This variety is _not_ identical with that\r\nknown in Italy as Adriatic.\r\n\r\nANGELIQUE (syn. _Angelica_).—Medium, pyriform; ribs prominent, yellowish\r\nwhite; pulp white with rose-colored center; leaves five-lobed. A very\r\ngood variety in some of the coast valleys.\r\n\r\nATHENES (syn. _Marseillaise_).—Small, roundish or turbinate, with\r\nindistinct ribs, depressed at apex, skin rough; color whitish yellow,\r\npulp red, opaline; very sweet and one of the best drying figs both in\r\nFrance and California.\r\n\r\nBOURJASSOTTE, BLACK (syn. _Barnissotte, Black_).—Medium, broader than\r\nlong, flattened at apex, with no neck and an uneven cheek; ribs\r\ndistinct, even; eye small, sunk, closed; skin waxy, black with violet\r\nblush; bloom clear blue, wanting at apex; meat pink, pulp blood-red. A\r\nmost excellent fig for table. It requires rich, moist soil.\r\n\r\nBOURJASSOTTE, WHITE (syn. _Barnissotte, White_).—A fig related to the\r\nformer, but larger; eye large, sunk; skin waxy, green; pulp bright red.\r\nA very fine fig. Tree very large.\r\n\r\nBROWN TURKEY.—Large, turbinate, pyriform, with hardly distinct neck;\r\nstalk short; apex flattened; ribs few, slightly elevated; eye medium,\r\nslightly open, scales large; skin smooth, greenish to violet-brown in\r\nsun, with darker ribs; pulp dark, rosy red, quality good, and tree a\r\ngood bearer. Brunswick is frequently confounded with this fig.\r\n\r\nBRUNSWICK.—Very large, pyriform, with swollen cheeks, one of which is\r\nlarger than the other; apex very obtuse; neck and stalk very short; ribs\r\ndistinct, but not much elevated; eye medium, open; skin pale amber with\r\nviolet tint; pulp amber. An early, large fig, but with no flavor. Very\r\ncommon; requires rich, moist soil.\r\n\r\nCELESTE, BLUE (syn. _Violette_).—Small, ovate, turbinate; ribs few, but\r\ndistinct, especially near apex; eye raised, rough; color dark, violet\r\namber, without reddish blush; bloom confined to the neck; skin thin;\r\npulp deep rose; meat amber; sweet, but lacking in flavor.\r\n\r\nDOTTATO.—Medium ovate, pyriform; neck well set; stalk very short or\r\nnone; ribs low; skin smooth; eye medium; skin thin, yellowish green;\r\nmeat white; pulp yellowish amber, sometimes with violet flush. One of\r\nthe best figs for drying; tree a strong grower, requiring moist, rich\r\nsoil. Lately introduced into California.\r\n\r\nDRAP D’OR.—Large, pyriform, with very low neck and stalk; ribs elevated;\r\napex obtuse and concave; color light, violet, reddish amber, not dark;\r\npulp rosy red. A fig of very fine quality, especially useful for\r\nconfections and crystallizing; not identical with Brunswick.\r\n\r\nDU ROI.—Above medium; round, pyriform; stalk very short; eye large or\r\nvariable, with scales standing out; skin smooth, pale bluish green; pulp\r\namber, with rosy streaks and exceedingly minute seeds. Related to\r\nMarseillaise and Athenes, and one of the very best figs in California\r\nfor drying.\r\n\r\nEARLY VIOLET.—Small to very small, round, turbinate; neck distinct but\r\nshort; stalk medium to long; ribs distinct, elevated, skin rough;\r\nviolet-brown, with thin, pearl-colored bloom; pulp red. This variety\r\nbears almost continuously and is preferable to the Ischias and Celeste.\r\n\r\nGENOA, WHITE.—Above medium, pyriform; neck small; stalk short; ribs\r\nindistinct; skin downy; eye very small; skin pale olive-green; pulp pale\r\nrose. One of the better figs, quite distinct from Marseillaise.\r\n\r\nGENTILE.—Very large; ovate pyriform; neck short but distinct; stalk very\r\nshort; skin uneven, with ridges; eye very large, open, with projecting\r\nscales; color greenish yellow spotted with white; pulp amber, streaked\r\nwith rose; seeds few but very large. Only the first crop of this variety\r\nripens. It is of the San Pedro tribe. One of the best early figs.\r\n\r\nGROSSE GRISE BIFÈRE.—Medium, ovate pyriform; neck very short, stalk\r\nshort; ribs distinct; eye small; skin downy, dark violet amber, pale\r\nolive in shade; the bloom is separated by a distinct line from the apex;\r\npulp deep red. A tender, good fig.\r\n\r\nISCHIA, BLACK.—Small; neck short; stalk medium; skin smooth; color dark,\r\nviolet black, greenish around the apex; neck dark; eye medium, open;\r\nbloom thin, dark blue; pulp red. Of fair quality but small size.\r\n\r\nISCHIA, WHITE.—Size below medium, round, with small neck; stalk very\r\nshort; eye open; skin smooth, bluish green with brown flush; pulp rosy\r\nred. Common in California, but hardly worthy of cultivation in that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMAGDALEN.—Below medium; round; ribs distinct, rough, disappearing around\r\nthe eye; stalk longer than the fig; eye open, large; skin greenish\r\nyellow; pulp amber white. A very delicious fig, superior to the Ischias\r\nand Celeste; not synonymous with Angelique.\r\n\r\nMARSEILLAISE, LONG.—Large, longer than wide; skin thick with brownish\r\nshade; pulp dull red. Requires moist soils. A fair fig which dries well;\r\nnot related to either Black or White Marseillaise.\r\n\r\nMARSEILLAISE, WHITE.—Medium ovate, pyriform; neck short; stalk medium;\r\nribs numerous and distinct; apex flattened; eye large, open; skin downy,\r\npale yellowish green, mottled with white; pulp amber, with a few large\r\nseeds. One of the best figs for drying. Requires sandy, rich soil.\r\n\r\nMISSION, BLACK.—Medium to large, turbinate; neck long; stalk short; ribs\r\ndistinct; eye prominent, open; skin rough, deep mahogany violet, with a\r\nred flush; pulp not fine, red, but not bright or brownish amber; sweet\r\nbut not high-flavored; common in the Southern States, California, and\r\nMexico. The oldest fig in this country.\r\n\r\nMONACO BIANCO (syn. _White Monaco_).—Large, rounded, turbinate,\r\nflattened; neck small but very distinct; ribs numerous; eye very open;\r\nskin dark, bluish green with thin bloom; pulp dark-red rose; a most\r\nexcellent fig for table; one of the best in California.\r\n\r\nPASTILIÈRE.—Large, 3 inches by 1½; elongated, pyriform with long neck;\r\nstalk short; eye closed, surrounded by an elevated iris; skin rough,\r\nhairy, with blue bloom; pulp red. Fine for preserves.\r\n\r\nRONDE NOIRE.—Large, round, but irregular; neck distinct, short; eye\r\nsmall; skin smooth, waxy, dark violet brown; pulp amber. Greatly to be\r\nrecommended as a table fig. It is not related to Black Ischia or Osborn\r\nProlific.\r\n\r\nSAN PEDRO, BLACK.—Very large, elongated ovate, with no stalk, but with\r\nwell set neck; skin smooth, violet black with green neck; pulp red,\r\ncoppery, tinted violet. For table use. The largest fig known. It is not\r\nrelated to the following variety:\r\n\r\nSAN PEDRO, WHITE (syn. _Brebas_).—Very large, round, flattened at apex;\r\nstalk and neck short; eye open; skin thick, tender, of a bright yellow\r\ncolor or greenish in the shade, without bloom; pulp amber. A remarkable\r\nand handsome fig. Only the first crop matures without caprification.\r\nSuited only for table use. Requires moist, rich soil.\r\n\r\nVERDAL, ROUND.—Below medium, round pyriform, without stalk or neck; skin\r\nsmooth, waxy, bluish green; eye closed; pulp dark, blood red. A small\r\nfig, but valuable for canning and preserves; better than the Ischias or\r\nCeleste. It does well in the Santa Clara Valley, but is inferior in the\r\ninterior of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CAPRIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThis process must be practiced wherever the Smyrna figs are grown, for\r\nwithout it they will not mature either seeds or figs. The flowers of the\r\nSmyrna figs are all pistillate and require pollination, which in the\r\ncase of these varieties can be effected on a large scale only through\r\ncaprification. The process consists in the suspension of wild caprifigs,\r\nwhich possess staminate and gall flowers, in the Smyrna fig trees, when\r\nthe pistils in the blossoms of the latter are in a receptive condition.\r\nA minute wasp, the _Blastophaga_, breeds in the caprifig in large\r\nnumbers, and on leaving it crawls into the Smyrna fig, covered with the\r\npollen of the caprifig. This pollen, transferred by contact from the\r\nbody of the wasp to the receptive stigmas of the flowers in the Smyrna\r\nfigs, effects the fertilization of the ovules of those flowers and\r\ncauses them to form seeds and mature the fruit of which they are a part.\r\nThese seeds impart a nutty aroma and flavor to the fig when dried, and\r\ngive it a marked superiority to our common figs. Caprification is not\r\nyet practiced in the United States, the wasp not existing here, though\r\nboth it and some of the Smyrna figs have been brought to this country\r\nseveral times. The first importation of Smyrna fig trees was made by\r\nGulian P. Rixford, about 1880, when three varieties of Smyrna figs and a\r\nsingle caprifig tree were introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CLIMATE SUITABLE FOR FIG CULTURE.\r\n\r\nA native of a semitropical climate, the fig requires a similar climate\r\nto attain perfection. Many horticultural varieties, however, have\r\noriginated in temperate regions, and these can be grown with profit in a\r\nclimate much colder than that of the habitat of the wild fig. Figs, in\r\nfact, may be grown in all regions where peaches and apricots succeed\r\nwithout protection, and if given winter protection they can be\r\nprofitably grown in such regions near large cities which furnish a\r\nmarket for the fresh fruit at profitable prices.\r\n\r\nIn considering the suitability of the climate of a region for fig\r\nculture, the purpose for which the figs are to be grown must be first\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nFigs may be grown for drying, for canning and preserving, for sale in\r\nthe fresh state, or for general home consumption. As the conditions and\r\ntreatment necessary to produce fruit suited to these different uses vary\r\nconsiderably, each subject will be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIGS FOR DRYING.\r\n\r\nThe best dried figs are produced in warm countries, such as the\r\nMediterranean region of Europe, Asia Minor, Upper and Lower California,\r\nbut especially in Asia Minor, in the valleys near Smyrna. The conditions\r\nof climate there are as follows: The days are moderately warm, the\r\ntemperature seldom exceeding 90° F. These conditions prevail during the\r\nsummer, while the figs are growing and ripening. The winter is seldom\r\nfrosty. The winter climate, however, is of less importance, provided it\r\nis not cold enough to injure the young figs or the tips of the branches.\r\nSuch frosts will not injure the second crop, which is used for drying,\r\nbut it is a great drawback to the wild fig and to the fig insects, which\r\nare necessary to the maturing of the fruit of certain varieties of\r\ndrying figs. The summer climate is almost rainless, while in winter\r\nthere are abundant rains. The air in summer is not a dry, desert air,\r\nhowever, but carries considerable moisture. The moisture of the air is\r\nan important point, as in a very dry air the figs do not develop high\r\nflavor, but are “flat” in taste. During the drying season there should\r\nbe little or no rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FIGS FOR TABLE USE.\r\n\r\nFigs are grown for the table as far north as Paris, in France, and in\r\nthe south of England.\r\n\r\nThey may be similarly grown in most of the Middle States of the United\r\nStates. In England figs are grown against walls as dwarf trees or\r\nshrubs, and the trees are covered with mats during the winter. In the\r\nvicinity of Paris the trees are dwarfed and grown as “suckers,” which\r\nare bent to the ground in winter and covered with several feet of soil.\r\nOnly certain varieties are suitable for this culture, which, however, is\r\nvery profitable. The figs produced are all “first crop” figs, and are as\r\na rule of superior quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n          FIGS FOR PRESERVING, CANNING, AND HOME CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nExcept in the most favored localities in the Southern States and\r\nCalifornia, these are the uses to which American-grown figs must be\r\ndevoted. To produce fruit suitable for these purposes, freedom from\r\nfogs, from summer rains, and from spring frosts is essential. If there\r\nis a choice of locality, a warm southern or eastern exposure is to be\r\npreferred. The soil should be well drained, never swampy, and the\r\nlocality should not be exposed to heavy winds. Elevated bottom lands or\r\nbenches along creeks are the most favorable localities for figs. Large\r\nplains, swampy places, or exposed hillsides are all unfavorable. The\r\nnearer the conditions approach those of the Smyrna region the better.\r\nRains during the fruiting season are frequently injurious to figs,\r\ncausing them to crack and sour. Still, the fruit may be profitably grown\r\nwhere moderate summer rains occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SOIL.\r\n\r\nAll varieties of figs do not require the same kind of soil. Most of\r\nthem, however, must have a warm, moist, but not wet soil. A very few\r\nvarieties thrive in a poor, gravelly soil, but most kinds require a\r\ndeep, rich loam, containing a considerable percentage of lime, in order\r\nto produce superior figs. A moderate proportion of gravel tends to keep\r\nthe soil warm and is desirable, but the soil must be rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROPAGATION.\r\n\r\nThe fig tree is easily propagated by the methods commonly practiced with\r\nfruit trees. It may be budded or grafted, but is most readily grown from\r\ncuttings. These may be planted where the trees are to stand or rooted in\r\nthe nursery rows and transplanted later to the orchard site. Which\r\nmethod is advisable for any particular site depends upon the conditions\r\nthere. If the soil and climatic conditions of the proposed location are\r\nfavorable to the uninterrupted growth of cuttings, it is better and\r\ncheaper to plant them directly in the field. If there is any doubt on\r\nthese points, or if the proper care and attention can not be given them,\r\nthe better plan is to plant trees with good roots and well-formed heads,\r\ngrown under favorable conditions by a nurseryman. The best time for\r\nmaking cuttings is after the leaves have fallen, when the fig tree is\r\ncomparatively dormant. Cuttings may be made of either one year or two\r\nyear old wood. If the cuttings are to be planted where they can remain,\r\n2-year-old wood is preferable, as longer cuttings can be secured, but if\r\nthey are to be planted in nursery, yearling wood is best. In either case\r\nthe wood when freshly cut should disclose a moist surface, covered with\r\nsmall, whitish, milky drops. If dry when cut, it should be discarded.\r\nThe length of the cutting must be regulated by the condition of the\r\nsoil. If this is moist and likely to remain so the cuttings may be 12 to\r\n18 inches long. If the surface soil is dry, the cutting should be\r\nsufficiently long to have its lower end in moist soil. On very dry soils\r\nthis may require a cutting 3 or 4 feet in length, though such long\r\ncuttings are rarely needed, and in no case except when they are to be\r\nplanted directly in the orchard. In making the cuttings care should be\r\nobserved that the lower cut be made just below a joint or node and the\r\nupper one just above a joint. The best cutting is one which terminates\r\nin a bud and has a smooth, clean cut just below a joint at its base. No\r\nmatter what the length of the cutting, it should always be planted so\r\ndeeply that but one joint protrudes above the surface of the soil. This\r\nwill prevent the drying out of the cutting by the action of sun and\r\nwind. It is better to have the top bud covered with earth than to leave\r\na high stump projecting above the surface.\r\n\r\nFig trees may be grown from single eyes or short tips, in boxes filled\r\nwith moist sand, set in frames and covered with cloth to keep the soil\r\nmoist and cool. These will make fine trees in time, but they generally\r\nrequire to be a year older than those grown from large cuttings before\r\nthey are suitable for planting in orchard. Great care should be\r\nexercised in removing fig cuttings or plants from one place to another.\r\nThey dry out readily and a few moments’ exposure to the sun or hot, dry\r\nwind will seriously damage them. They should never be allowed to become\r\ndry, and should be wrapped in wet sacks or cloths as soon as taken from\r\nthe trees or from the propagating bed. Cuttings partially dry may be\r\nrevived by soaking in water, but fig roots once dry are dead and\r\nincapable of restoration to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\nSeedling figs are easily grown from seeds of imported Smyrna figs. These\r\nSmyrna figs always possess germinable seeds, as they have been\r\npollinated. It is quite safe to say that any seedling fig so far\r\nrecorded in this country has originated from seeds of Smyrna figs\r\nimported from Asia Minor. The seeds of our common figs are mere shells\r\nwithout germs, and will of course fail to grow. The percentage of trees\r\nproducing fruit of high quality among seedlings grown from Smyrna figs\r\nis very small, however, and a commercial orchard planted with such\r\nseedlings would be a failure. The grower may now and then produce a\r\nvariety which will repay his efforts, and such variety can be propagated\r\nfor general planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BUDDING AND GRAFTING.\r\n\r\nThe fig may be propagated by shield budding, provided the work is done\r\nat the proper time. That time is winter, when the tree is as near\r\ndormant as it can be found. Budding is rarely resorted to, however, as\r\nit is an uncertain method when done by persons without skill. Grafting\r\nthe fig is successfully practiced in California by a method invented by\r\nMr. John Rock. It is the only method of fig grafting that has proved\r\nreliable, practical, and of real value there. By means of it, new\r\nvarieties are brought into heavy bearing within three years after\r\ngrafting on old trees. In addition to this saving of time, the usual\r\nadvantages resulting from grafting, such as better and stronger stock,\r\nmore vigorous growth, etc., may also be attained.\r\n\r\nThe best time for grafting the fig is autumn or winter, when the sap is\r\nmost sluggish. Late spring grafting is less successful. The best scions\r\nare made of 2-year-old wood. The sloping end of the scion must be\r\nwedge-shape, tapering from front to back as well as from the top of the\r\ncut to the bottom. But one surface of the wedge should show the pith,\r\nand this surface should face toward the center of the stock when the\r\nscion is set. Incipient fruit buds should be cut away without injuring\r\nthe scion. The scion should be so placed that the broad side of the\r\nwedge will be outside and the narrow edge toward the center of the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nFor the stock, any limb from 2 to 4 inches in diameter may be used. This\r\nshould be cut off squarely at the point to be grafted. A downward cut\r\nshould then be made with a chisel, in such a way that it shall be\r\ntangential to the circular stub. It must not pass through the pith of\r\nthe stub. The cut should run somewhat obliquely downward and outward, in\r\norder that the stock may not be split. The scion, which is about 3 or 4\r\ninches long, must, when inserted, form an angle with the long diameter\r\n[pith] of the stock branch on which it is grafted.\r\n\r\nIt is best to place two scions on each branch grafted. These should be\r\non opposite sides of the stub and they should lean slightly toward each\r\nother. The exposed surfaces of the stock and scion should then be\r\nheavily waxed and the scions should be held in place by binding with\r\ncord or other material. It is best to place a large number of scions on\r\none tree. Four or five branches may be cut off and grafted, but one or\r\ntwo should be left uncut for a year to draw the sap. A large stake\r\nshould be driven into the ground near each branch grafted, and when the\r\nscions have started the new growth should be secured to the stakes to\r\nprevent them from breaking off. The trunk and main limbs of the fig tree\r\nshould be covered with bundles of straw to prevent sunburn. The\r\nafter-treatment of the new growth is similar to that required in the\r\ngrafting of other fruit trees. The new growth is strong and rapid and\r\nthe connection with the stock perfect. Ninety per cent of the grafts may\r\nbe readily made to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PLANTING.\r\n\r\nThe proper distance to be given fig trees in the orchard depends upon\r\nthe size and habit of the variety to be planted. The smaller kinds\r\nrequire 25 feet; the larger ones should be 50 feet apart in every\r\ndirection. Sometimes other fruit trees are planted between the figs and\r\nallowed to remain until the latter become so large that they require the\r\nentire space. The fig tree requires an abundance of air and sunshine to\r\nmature its fruit, and it is therefore absolutely necessary that the\r\ntrees be so arranged that they shall not shade one another. After the\r\ndistance is decided, the laying out and planting require the same\r\ngeneral skill, labor, and methods used in planting other permanent\r\norchards. A few points in planting are peculiar to the fig, however, and\r\nrequire special consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DOUBLE TREES.\r\n\r\nTrees may be set singly, as standards, in the way commonly practiced\r\nwith other fruit trees, or they may be set “double”—that is, two trees\r\nplanted together in one hole and allowed to remain. The latter method\r\nhas not heretofore been advocated in this country but is worthy of\r\nthorough trial. The method consists in planting two long cuttings, about\r\n12 inches apart, in the same hole, allowing them to protrude from the\r\nground a few inches. Both are allowed to grow and the two are treated as\r\na single tree with two stems or standards. The object sought is to\r\nproduce two distinct stems or trunks, in order that the splitting down\r\nof branches may be prevented. In this way trees with low, sloping\r\nbranches, having their main trunks leaning outward, will be formed and\r\nit will be impossible for the trunks, the main branches, or the smaller\r\nones to split down. Branches split only when they point upward or stand\r\nstraight out—never when they slope downward from the trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD TREES.\r\n\r\nThese may be planted in the usual way, but great care must be taken in\r\nshading the roots while the trees are being planted. After they are set,\r\nthe trunks should be shaded by wrapping them with paper bags or other\r\nmaterial, as a sun-burnt tree will never regain its health or bear\r\nprofitably. Standard trees should only be set for ornament or shade, and\r\neven for these purposes the double trees are preferable. The fig tree\r\nnaturally branches near the ground, and the only way to successfully\r\nimitate this habit in cultivation is to plant by the double-tree method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRUNING.\r\n\r\nThe pruning of the fig varies according to the age of the trees and the\r\npurpose for which pruning is done. While other fruit trees require\r\nyearly, and generally heavy, pruning to insure fruit of good quality,\r\nthe object in pruning the fig is simply, or at least principally, to\r\nkeep the tree healthy and give air and light to the fruit. The most\r\nimportant rule to be observed in pruning the fig is that no branch shall\r\nbe cut off squarely or be cut back so as to leave a stump. This is\r\nalmost surely fatal to the future welfare of the tree and to the quality\r\nand quantity of its fruit. When it becomes necessary to remove a\r\n1-year-old limb the cut should be made at least as far down as the next\r\nfork below, and it should be close to a joint in the fork. There should\r\nbe nothing left but a scar to show that a limb has been cut away. There\r\nmust be no stump left. The fig tree may require to have its branches\r\nthinned out, but it must not be headed back except to correct\r\nunsymmetrical growth. In dense trees branches which cross should be\r\nremoved entirely and in such a way as to give the tree a rounded,\r\ndome-like outline, with the lower branches nearly touching the ground.\r\nIn pruning recently planted trees the object in view is, of course,\r\nentirely different, as fruit can not be expected for several years to\r\ncome. The object of this early pruning is to shape the tree. When two\r\ncuttings are set together little pruning is required, as they will\r\ngenerally shape themselves and form two main trunks diverging from each\r\nother, but when a single tree is planted it is best to cut back the stem\r\nto within a foot of the soil and let it branch from that point. The only\r\ncase in which it is proper to have a tall standard is when it is\r\ndesirable to grow trees for shade and pleasure and where the quality of\r\nthe fruit and its quantity are of but secondary importance. If recently\r\nplanted fig trees show any tendency toward drying out, the main limbs or\r\nthe whole trunk should at once be cut back to live green wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DRYING AND CURING.\r\n\r\nThe drying and curing of figs must necessarily differ in different\r\ncountries, under different conditions, and for different purposes. For\r\nhome consumption little skill and care are required to produce a\r\npalatable and useful article of diet, while figs intended for shipment\r\nmust be more carefully dried, cured, and packed in order to command a\r\nfair price in competition with the imported article.\r\n\r\nThe fig is mature and ready to dry only when it has attained its proper\r\nsize and is palatable for eating fresh. When the crop has reached this\r\nstage it may be gathered and dried for home consumption, but in order to\r\nproduce a superior article the figs must be as sweet as possible and\r\nvery pulpy. Too often do we find figs in the market consisting of\r\nnothing but skin and empty seeds, without sweetness, flavor, or pulp.\r\nFigs do not ripen all at one time, and the trees must be gone over\r\ndaily, in order that only the ripest shall be gathered. Before being\r\npicked the fig should be soft to the touch; it should be wrinkled, and\r\nshould hang downward. Some kinds when ripe show white seams or cracks in\r\nthe flesh. This is generally a sign of complete maturity. Figs will not\r\nripen after picking and never become sweeter than when cut from the\r\ntree. Similarly, figs which have once attained their full maturity do\r\nnot improve and should be dried at once. If allowed to hang longer on\r\nthe tree they may quickly rot, sour, or mold, and soon become unfit for\r\nuse. In order to compete with the best imported figs, our figs intended\r\nfor drying should be very sweet; in fact, the sweeter the better. When\r\nfreshly cut they should contain 35 per cent of sugar and when dried\r\nabout 55 per cent. For home consumption they do not need to be so sweet\r\nas this, for any palatable figs are useful when carefully dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PICKING.\r\n\r\nFigs to be dried should never be shaken from the trees, for if bruised\r\nand injured they will sour during the drying and become unfit for use. A\r\nfew figs spoiled in this way will check or prevent the sale of a box of\r\nfruit that is in other respects good. Pulling the figs from the trees\r\nwill also injure them in a similar way. The ripe figs should therefore\r\nbe cut from the tree with a knife or shears and carefully placed in\r\nboxes or trays. Of course, many half-dried figs that drop from the trees\r\nmay be utilized, but they should first be examined to determine whether\r\nthey are in good condition, and they must be freed from soil and sand.\r\nOur figs do not, as a rule, drop at perfect maturity, but either before\r\nor after it. Only the Smyrna figs drop when fully ripe.\r\n\r\nFor the higher growing varieties a convenient instrument called the “fig\r\ncutter” may be used. It consists of a forked stick across which has been\r\nnailed a strip of tin plate. Below this is a small bag kept open by a\r\nwire. With this “cutter” the higher figs may be reached by running the\r\nfork up under the fig, severing it from the branch and causing it to\r\ndrop into the bag below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SULPHURING.\r\n\r\nOf late years sulphuring figs before drying has become a very common\r\npractice among growers. It consists in exposing fresh fruit to the fumes\r\nof burning sulphur in air-tight tray holders of varying sizes. The\r\nsulphur fumes cause the figs to become semitransparent when dried, and\r\nto present an attractive appearance to the buyer. But nothing is more\r\ndeceptive, for this very handsome appearance hides a more than worthless\r\ninterior, not only detestable to the taste but also injurious to the\r\nhealth of the consumer. Few persons will buy such fruit a second time.\r\nBesides giving a semitransparent appearance to the fruit, the sulphuring\r\nprevents fermentation of the figs while drying. This, of course, is of\r\nvalue, and in fact is the only advantage in the process. A short and\r\nlight sulphuring may therefore be admissible with varieties which\r\notherwise would not dry and cure without souring.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the box in which the figs are to be sulphured should\r\nnot be more than 5 feet high nor more than 7 or 8 feet wide. This will\r\nadmit two trays abreast. The trays slide on a rack or on a cleat nailed\r\nto the sides of the box, and need not be farther apart than just\r\nsufficient to clear each other when charged with a single layer of figs.\r\nThe door must be air-tight, in order that the sulphur fumes may not\r\nescape. Two feet of space should be left between the bottom tray and the\r\nsulphur pan. The latter, a heavy piece of sheet iron, is heated, but not\r\nto redness, and placed on noncombustible supports in the bottom of the\r\nbox. Two handfuls of sulphur are thrown upon this iron and when it is\r\nburning the doors are tightly closed. Exposure to the sulphur fumes for\r\nfifteen minutes is sufficient to prevent fermentation during the drying\r\nprocess and leave the figs with a minimum of sour taste. If sulphured\r\nlonger they become too acid. After removal from the box the figs should\r\nbe immediately exposed to the sun. Black figs should never be sulphured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DIPPING FRESH FIGS.\r\n\r\nInstead of being sulphured to improve their color and soften their\r\nskins, figs may be dipped into a hot solution of salt or saltpeter, or\r\neven lye. Unless, however, they are immersed for a long time this\r\ndipping will rarely prevent fermentation, though it will prove\r\nadvantageous in other ways. Figs with a rough and tough skin are\r\nespecially benefited, the principal effect of the dipping being to\r\nsoften the skin. But this dipping should be practiced only on figs of\r\ninferior quality, the best grades not being improved either by dipping\r\nor sulphuring.\r\n\r\nIn dipping, the figs should first be placed in a perforated bucket and\r\nrinsed in cold water, to free them from dust. They should then be\r\ntransferred to a kettle containing boiling lye, made of 1 pound of\r\npotash to 10 gallons of water. An immersion of from one-fourth minute to\r\none minute suffices; the time being regulated according to the size of\r\nthe figs and the pliability and thickness of the skin. Boiling salt\r\nwater may be substituted for the lye water for the dipping of some figs,\r\ndifferent varieties requiring different solutions to secure the desired\r\nresult. After dipping, the figs are dried without rinsing. If salt or\r\nsaltpeter is used instead of lye, 1½ pounds of either to 50 gallons of\r\nwater is a proper quantity. Lye is generally used, but the writer\r\nprefers salt or saltpeter, either of which gives good results as regards\r\npliability of skin, while the salty taste generally improves the flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DRYING ON TRAYS.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in handling, wooden or paper trays are commonly used for\r\ndrying figs in the Western States. By their use the fruit can easily be\r\nstacked and sheltered in wet weather. The trays are of various sizes,\r\nbut a small size, such as 2½ feet by 3½ feet, or 3½ feet by 4 feet, is\r\npreferable, as when filled with fruit it can easily be handled by one\r\nman, while a larger size requires two men. The drying ground should be a\r\nclean space outside the orchard, where the trays may be exposed to the\r\nuninterrupted rays of the sun. The figs require all the sunshine\r\nobtainable, and the drying ground must therefore be free from the shade\r\nof trees or buildings. The drying floor may consist simply of beds of\r\nsoil elevated a foot above the general level. A drying floor 4 feet wide\r\nmay be raised 8 inches additionally along one side. The slope toward the\r\nsun thus given will insure greater heat. Trays may be placed on strips\r\nof wood or scantlings supported by low sawhorses. The sawhorses should\r\nbe long enough to support two rows of trays abreast. Three scantlings or\r\nstrips will be required for each pair of sawhorses. They should be of\r\neven lengths, as long as obtainable, and the middle one should be larger\r\nthan the outside ones; 2 by 4 inches for the middle one and 2 by 3\r\ninches for the side scantlings will be found convenient sizes. The figs\r\nshould be placed singly on the tray, with their eyes all toward one\r\nside, and this side of the tray should be slightly raised in order to\r\nprevent the contents of very juicy figs from running out during the\r\nprocess of drying. The raising of the trays is the most easily\r\naccomplished by placing the 2 by 4 inch supporting strip in the middle\r\nof the sawhorses and the 2 by 3 inch strips on either side. Immediately\r\nafter sulphuring, if that is practiced, or after dipping, the fruit\r\nshould be spread and the trays distributed on the racks where they will\r\nhave the full benefit of the hottest sun. This distribution of the trays\r\nshould be finished before noon each day to secure the best color of the\r\ndried product.\r\n\r\nThe figs must be turned twice a day at first and once a day in the later\r\nstages of drying. The turning requires much work and expense, as it can\r\nbe done well only by hand labor. An inferior product may be turned by\r\nplacing an empty tray face downward upon a filled one and inverting\r\nthem, leaving the fruit on the new tray. To produce the best grade of\r\ndried fruit, the figs should not touch one another on the trays during\r\nthe process of drying. During the turning, all inferior figs, such as\r\nthose that ferment and puff up, should be culled out and used for\r\nvinegar. Figs which show a slight froth at the eye are turning sour and\r\nshould be removed.\r\n\r\nCovering the figs must not be neglected, if a choice article of dried\r\nfruit is to be produced. If white figs are left out over night\r\nuncovered, they will be discolored. Rain and dew are very damaging and\r\nthe fruit should be protected from them. This is best accomplished, in\r\nCalifornia, by stacking the trays one on top of another when rain is\r\nexpected. The top and sides of the stacks should then be protected with\r\nempty trays. If permanent drying beds of gravel and cement are made, a\r\nmechanical device for covering the trays with a horizontal canvas\r\ncurtain can be used, and in this way they can easily be covered every\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DEGREE OF DRYNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that drying cease when the figs have reached the\r\nproper stage for packing. They must on no account be overdried nor\r\nshould they be removed from the trays too soon. The proper degree of\r\ndryness can be detected by pressing the figs between the thumb and\r\nfinger. They should be soft and pliable, with the contents distinctly\r\npulpy, and when squeezed the fig should not resume its former shape, but\r\nremain pressed. It should be plastic, not elastic nor dry. Underdried\r\nfigs will spoil in packing, while overdried ones are hard, leathery, and\r\nworthless as food or delicacy. The trays must be gone over every day and\r\nthe properly dried figs taken off, the spoiled ones being removed at the\r\nsame time. The time required for drying varies from four to sixteen\r\ndays. Drying within six or seven days yields the best quality of\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SWEATING AND EQUALIZING.\r\n\r\nDried figs are greatly benefited by being sweated or equalized as\r\nregards moisture. This is accomplished by placing them in sweat boxes\r\nholding 75 pounds or more. The boxes are stacked up one across another\r\nin such a way as to insure a free circulation of air. This is to prevent\r\nthe sour fermentation, which would spoil the figs. The room where the\r\nsweat boxes are stored should be closed and the walls should preferably\r\nbe of brick. Daily examination of the contents of the boxes should be\r\nmade, so that any inclination of the fruit to ferment and heat may be\r\ndetected. In a few days an improvement in the texture of the figs will\r\nbe noticed, the overdried ones having attracted moisture from those that\r\nwere underdried and all having become more pliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ARTIFICIAL DRYING.\r\n\r\nWhere figs can not be dried in the open air, evaporators or driers,\r\nheated artificially, may be used to advantage, just as in the drying and\r\ncuring of raisins. Large driers are expensive and are beyond the reach\r\nof many growers, but small driers, holding a ton of fruit, may be built\r\ncheaply. It may be safely stated, however, that localities where\r\nartificial drying is necessary are not suited to the most profitable\r\nproduction of commercial figs, as any extra handling will greatly\r\nincrease the cost of the product. Where a very superior article is\r\nproduced the occasional use of the drier may be profitable, in order to\r\nsave a crop that would otherwise be injured by inclement weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PACKING.\r\n\r\nThe method of packing dried figs and the kind of package used should\r\nvary according to the quality of the finished product. They should be\r\npacked in order to prevent drying out, as well as to make them present\r\nan attractive appearance. It pays to pack the best grades well, for good\r\npacking always enhances the value of fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DIPPING.\r\n\r\nThe first step in packing is the dipping of the dried fruit, and this\r\nmust be done whether the figs are packed cheaply or expensively. The\r\ndipping, which must be done just before packing, causes the figs to\r\nbecome soft and pliable, equalizes moisture, and improves the skin and\r\nits color. Perforated buckets holding 5 gallons of dried figs are\r\nsuitable vessels for holding the figs during the dipping. A kettle\r\narranged for heating water and large enough to permit the immersion of\r\nthe bucket of figs should be provided. In this kettle sea water or brine\r\nmade of one-fourth pound of coarse salt to a gallon of water should be\r\nheated to the boiling point. The bucket of figs should then be immersed\r\nin this boiling brine for a few seconds and emptied on to wire screens\r\nto drain. While draining, the figs should be covered with a cloth or\r\notherwise kept dark. The fruit should be packed on the same day that it\r\nis dipped. The best grade of white figs, or very soft figs of any grade,\r\nshould only be dipped in _cold_ salt water, just before packing. The\r\nsalt water is never washed off, and the salt that remains does not in\r\nthe least injure the figs, but, on the contrary, improves their quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ASSORTING.\r\n\r\nThe inferior figs which were removed from the trays during the drying\r\nprocess should be assorted into at least two sizes for packing. A yet\r\nlower grade which can not be profitably packed may be sold in sacks. The\r\nlargest Smyrna figs weigh, when dried, about 23 grams [355 grains, or\r\nabout four-fifths of an ounce avoirdupois], while the average French and\r\nItalian figs weigh each about 8 grams [123.45 grains, or a little more\r\nthan one-fourth of an ounce avoirdupois].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PULLING.\r\n\r\nThe best grades of figs should be pulled or flattened before packing.\r\nThis pulling consists first in squeezing the fig with the hand to soften\r\nit, and then flattening it so as to shape it into a disk in which the\r\neye and stalk are nearly in the center of the flat sides, as may be\r\nobserved in packages of figs imported from Smyrna. The object of this\r\npulling is to have the figs present as fine a surface as possible when\r\nthey are pressed and packed, this method enabling the packer to hide the\r\neye and stalk ends effectually. For inferior brands it will suffice to\r\nsimply flatten the figs in such a way that the eye and stalk are at\r\nopposite extremities of the fruit when pressed. In pulling and handling\r\nthe figs, the hands of the worker should always be moistened with salt\r\nwater to prevent them from becoming sticky with sirup and thus soiling\r\nthe figs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PACKING.\r\n\r\nThe packing should be regulated according to the size and quality of the\r\nfigs. The size of the boxes will therefore vary, but they may be made to\r\ncontain 5, 10, or 20 pounds each. In Smyrna the figs are packed in the\r\nshape of bars, and this method should be followed for all the better\r\ngrades. In order to pack quickly in bar fashion, the writer several\r\nyears ago invented a “bar-packing device” or “guide.” This guide\r\nconsists of a frame of two or three parallel strips of tin or zinc\r\nconnected at opposite ends by two similar strips. The guide, which is\r\nreally a metal box without top or bottom, fits exactly into the packing\r\nbox flush against two of the sides, but is slightly higher than the\r\ndepth of the box in order that it may be pulled out after filling. The\r\nguide is placed in an empty fig box, thus dividing it into three or more\r\ncompartments. The figs are then placed in rows in each compartment with\r\nthe eyes downward, each fig slightly overlapping the other, in the way\r\nshingles are laid on a roof, just sufficiently to hide the stalks. The\r\ncompartments in the guide should be slightly narrower, or at most no\r\nwider than the figs, so that when pressure is applied the figs will\r\nflatten and fill them. The object of the guide is to keep the fig bars\r\nseparate. After the box is full a slight pressure is applied, which\r\nsqueezes the figs against the sides of the guide, and when the latter is\r\nwithdrawn leaves the bars intact without large air holes between the\r\nfigs or bars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PRESSING.\r\n\r\nThe raisin presses used in California are suitable for pressing figs.\r\nThere is no better machine for this purpose made anywhere. A follower of\r\nwood covered with zinc is first placed in each compartment on the figs\r\nand a slight pressure applied in the press. The pressure must be strong\r\nenough to bring the figs to the level of the box. The guide is then\r\nlifted out, while the fingers of the packer press firmly on the follower\r\nto hold the figs in place. Instead of having a guide in which the bars\r\nare connected at the ends, the box may be grooved on the inside and a\r\nsingle strip of zinc or tin dropped down, thus dividing the box into two\r\nor more compartments as may be necessary. The strips are more easily\r\nremoved than the more complicated guide. Before the box is nailed up,\r\nsmall leaves of the sweet bay (_Laurus nobilis_) should be inserted\r\nbetween the figs on the surface, and over the whole should be spread a\r\nsheet of waxed paper. Instead of the sweet bay leaves, other native\r\nlaurel leaves may be used, provided they are aromatic, have the\r\ndistinctive laurel flavor, and are not otherwise objectionable.\r\n\r\nIt can not be too strongly urged that American-grown figs be packed and\r\nsold under their proper labels and not designated “Smyrna” figs. Careful\r\nselection of varieties, skill in growing and curing, and careful, honest\r\npacking will in time procure a large market for our figs.\r\n\r\nIn all the Mediterranean countries the fresh as well as the dried fig is\r\na common article of diet, both nourishing and wholesome, and it is only\r\na question of time when its value will be generally recognized in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FIG CULTURE IN THE GULF STATES.\r\n                           By FRANK S. EARLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fig is a domestic fruit of prime importance in all the Gulf and\r\nSouth Atlantic States; throughout this region it is a common dooryard\r\ntree. Its broad, rich foliage is one of the first things to catch the\r\neye of the Northern visitor and assure him that he is really in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nToward its northern limit the tree is sometimes injured by unusually\r\nsevere winters, but unless killed to the ground it never fails to\r\nproduce heavy annual crops. Even severe winter-killing is usually but a\r\ntemporary loss, as the roots send up vigorous sprouts that bear the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fig is so widely distributed and so universally esteemed\r\nfor household uses, it is only recently that any attempt has been made\r\nin the territory under consideration to utilize it as a commercial\r\nproduct. In the search throughout the South for possible money crops,\r\nother than cotton, it is beginning to attract attention, and in this\r\nconnection a brief statement of our present knowledge as to the growth\r\nand possible uses of the fig may be of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROPAGATION.\r\n\r\nThe fig roots easily from cuttings and is usually propagated in this\r\nway. Short pieces or even large branches of well-matured wood, cut from\r\nthe tree at any time during the winter and simply thrust into the soil,\r\nwill usually take root and make a strong growth the following summer.\r\nThe well-matured wood is best for making cuttings. One of the most\r\ndesirable methods is to cut a section bearing a short but thrifty\r\nlateral branch from a good-sized limb. The section taken should be 6 or\r\n8 inches long and be entirely buried in the ground, leaving the end of\r\nthe side branch projecting to form the tree. This is not at all\r\nessential, as a straight cutting will usually root and grow readily, but\r\nit is desirable, as the buried cross section holds the cutting firmly in\r\nthe ground and its bulk prevents it from drying out easily. In the coast\r\nregion cuttings are often planted in August with good results. In this\r\ncase the leaves should be removed. It is advisable to plant the cutting\r\nwhere the tree is to stand, as fig roots are easily injured by\r\ntransplanting. Little is gained in growth by planting rooted trees, but\r\nwhen such are used both roots and tops should be heavily pruned when\r\nplanted, to secure a satisfactory growth.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is advisable to plant the cuttings in the nursery and to\r\nkeep them there for three years before removing them to their permanent\r\nlocation, as winter protection can be more easily given them. After the\r\ntrunk of the fig is three years old it is much less easily injured by\r\ncold. This practice would seem to be of doubtful value, since young figs\r\nare more often injured by late frosts after growth has started in the\r\nspring than by the greater cold of midwinter when they are dormant. Figs\r\ncan be grafted without difficulty, but it is seldom done in the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOIL AND LOCATION.\r\n\r\nThe fig will grow in almost any location, but it attains its highest\r\ndevelopment on a rich, moist, but well-drained soil, that contains\r\nabundant humus.\r\n\r\nA plentiful supply of lime, phosphoric acid, and potash is also needed,\r\nand if not contained in the soil must be supplied by fertilization. The\r\nbest conditions for fig growth are found in the bottoms and hammocks\r\nrather than in the sandy uplands, though many fine specimens can be\r\nfound in either location. In planting for home use it is advisable to\r\nplant the trees near the house and about the farm buildings, for they\r\nalways thrive in such locations, while many failures have been made in\r\nattempting to establish them under orchard conditions, especially in the\r\nlight soils of the “piney woods” region. It is not easy to account for\r\nthese failures, since the old dooryard trees are so universally healthy\r\nand thrifty, though growing without care or attention. Several causes\r\ncan be cited that may contribute to the result, but all seem\r\ninsufficient to account fully for the facts observed. There must be some\r\nundetected factor that contributes to the almost universal superiority\r\nof dooryard over orchard-grown fig trees in the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious difficulties in establishing a fig orchard\r\narises from the fact that the young trees are tender and easily injured\r\nby the cold. Figs start very early in the season, and the frequently\r\noccurring spring frosts often catch them in quite vigorous growth. This\r\ndoes no great harm to old trees; though the young leaves are killed,\r\nthey soon push out again, and as the principal crop of fruit is borne on\r\nthe new wood the crop is not much injured. With young trees, however, it\r\nis different, as the tissues of the trunk are softer. Fine, thrifty\r\ntrees of one or two years’ growth are killed to the ground by a slight\r\nfreeze after their spring growth has started. They may start again from\r\nthe root, but their vitality is injured and they do not seem to fully\r\nrecover. Such trees at 3 or 4 years old are often no larger than after\r\nthe first summer’s growth. Young trees also suffer much more severely\r\nthan old ones from extreme cold in winter, even when entirely dormant.\r\nIt would appear that the shelter afforded by buildings and yard fences\r\nmay sufficiently protect young trees from damage, when in an open space\r\nthey would be severely injured. Then, if from a dozen cuttings stuck\r\ndown in such out-of-the-way places only two or three grow, they are seen\r\nand remembered, while the failures are forgotten, whereas an orchard row\r\nshowing a stand of only one-fourth is very unsatisfactory. The dooryard\r\ntree usually gets the benefit of ashes and house-slops, and perhaps the\r\nwash from the barnyard. These sources of fertility are all beneficial,\r\nfor the fig is a gross feeder. Its roots are never broken by the plow,\r\nwhich is another great advantage, for the fig has a shallow rooting\r\nhabit and does not thrive when its feeding roots are disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the light soils of the South it is extremely difficult to keep plows\r\nand cultivators from running so deep as to do serious injury to fig\r\ntrees, and the proper cultivation or treatment of a fig orchard is\r\ntherefore a serious question. Many growers advise against plowing after\r\nthe first year, but the tree will not thrive if choked with grass and\r\nweeds. To keep a large orchard clean with a hoe is no small undertaking.\r\nSome advocate heavy mulching to keep down weeds, and that is doubtless\r\noften advisable, but the hard, clean-swept southern dooryard seems to\r\nsuit the root habit of the fig better than any system of cultivation yet\r\ndevised. Another point to be considered is that the fig suffers severely\r\nfrom root knot when planted in the fields where vegetables or cowpeas\r\nhave been grown, as the nematodes causing this trouble multiply in the\r\nroots of all such crops.\r\n\r\nIn planting a fig orchard care should be taken to select new land that\r\nis known to be free from these pests.\r\n\r\nThe fig has a spreading habit of growth and when old requires\r\nconsiderable room. As the cuttings cost but little, it is well to plant\r\nrather closely, with the expectation of thinning out the trees when\r\nnecessary. With 200 trees to the acre the earlier crops would be double\r\nthose obtained from a planting of half that number, though doubtless 100\r\nfull-grown trees would sufficiently occupy the land. Twelve by 16 is a\r\nsuitable distance for the trees when young. Removing alternate rows when\r\nneeded would leave the permanent planting 16 by 24 feet. It is best to\r\nplant two or three cuttings at each place, to be sure of a stand. All\r\nbut the most vigorous can be cut out if more than one starts to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CULTIVATION AND FERTILIZATION.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably figs should be thoroughly cultivated during the first\r\nseason. This is necessary to give them a good start, and as the young\r\ntrees make their largest growth after midsummer it is important to\r\ncontinue the cultivation late in the season. Unless the soil is quite\r\nrich some fertilizer should be used, as the future of the tree depends\r\nlargely on its vigor during the first season. An excessive use of stable\r\nmanure or other nitrogenous fertilizer should be avoided, as the\r\ntendency of these is to induce a soft, succulent growth too easily\r\ninjured by the winter. The “piny-woods” soils are deficient in\r\nphosphoric acid, and this should be a prominent ingredient of all\r\nfertilizers used in regions where these predominate.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable to attempt to cultivate any vegetable crop among fig\r\ntrees, on account of the danger of increasing root knot, and because\r\nsuch crops are likely to interfere with cultivation at the time when it\r\nmay be most needed.\r\n\r\nThe best subsequent treatment for a fig orchard is, to a certain extent,\r\nan open question. It is probable that in most locations the best results\r\nwill be obtained by mulching heavily near the tree with any available\r\nmaterial that will hold moisture and keep down the weeds. Pine straw,\r\nmarsh grass, or planer shavings answer the purpose. The dust from old\r\ncharcoal pits is sometimes used, and on the coast a mulch of oyster\r\nshells is often seen. The slowly decomposing shells probably act to some\r\nextent as a fertilizer, since the fig is known to thrive best in strong\r\nlime soils. The middle of the rows can be kept clean by a shallow\r\nplowing and harrowing without disturbing the mulch and without injury to\r\nthe roots protected by it. Winter protection of some kind should\r\ncertainly be provided during the first two or three years, at least to\r\nthe extent of mounding the dirt or mulch high about the base of the tree\r\nin the fall. Protecting the tops with old gunny sacks or pine branches\r\nwill often prove of great advantage.\r\n\r\nPruning is seldom practiced, except so far as may be necessary to\r\nproperly shape the young tree, and this is better done in summer by\r\npinching. In case of a freeze, all injured wood should be promptly cut\r\naway. It is said that the size of the fruit can be greatly increased by\r\njudicious pruning, but, as before stated, it is seldom done.\r\n\r\nFigs come into bearing very early. A thrifty growing cutting will often\r\nset some fruit the first season, but this seldom matures. When the tree\r\ndoes not winterkill, a little fruit may be expected the second season,\r\nand by the third the crop should be of some importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      INSECT ENEMIES AND DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThe fig is usually spoken of as being comparatively free from insect\r\nenemies, and the literature of its diseases, of which there are a\r\nnumber, is scanty. It is probably true that in most localities it is\r\nless frequently injured from these causes than are other fruit trees.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases reported from the South the one causing most\r\nwidespread injury is doubtless root knot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIG-TREE BORER.\r\n\r\nA longicorn beetle, _Ptychodes vittatus_, has caused considerable injury\r\nat some points in Louisiana and Mississippi by burrowing into the trunk\r\nand larger branches. In reply to inquiries regarding this insect,\r\nDirector W. C. Stubbs, of the Louisiana Experiment Station, says:\r\n\r\n    The damage done in Louisiana is to a large extent conjectural.\r\n    In our groves we have lost several trees temporarily, all being\r\n    bored into by this borer. They, however, start up again quickly\r\n    from the roots and soon replace the injured trees. We have had\r\n    no remedy against this invasion except to dig it out while very\r\n    young with a penknife. We have tried various insecticides\r\n    without any apparent results.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FIG-LEAF MITE.\r\n\r\nA browning and subsequent premature falling of the leaves, caused by the\r\nwork of a minute mite, is reported as rather common in Florida by Mr. H.\r\nJ. Webber, of the Subtropical Laboratory. It has not been studied.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellison A. Smith, jr., botanist and entomologist of South Carolina\r\nExperiment Station, has published a list[1] of insects observed feeding\r\non ripe figs, but he does not mention any that injure the tree.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  South Carolina Experiment Station, Annual Report, 1889, pp. 105, 106.\r\n  The list is as follows: Allorhina nitida (L.), Ptychodes trilineatus,\r\n  Lybithea bachmanni (Kirth), Apatura celtidis (Bd. Sec.), Grapta\r\n  interrogationis (F.), Pyrameis atalanta (L.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ROOT KNOT.\r\n\r\nThis disease is caused by a microscopic nematode or true worm,\r\n_Heterodera radicola_,[2] that infests the soft fibrous roots causing\r\nsmall galls or swellings. When present in sufficient numbers it causes\r\nthe death of the roots and the consequent starvation and death of the\r\ntree. It is by no means confined to the fig, but attacks the roots of\r\nmany other fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs and is especially\r\ninjurious to many garden vegetables and farm crops.[3] This pest thrives\r\nbest in moist sandy soils, and is troublesome throughout the entire\r\ncoast region.\r\n\r\nNo effective remedy is known when a tree is once infested, hence the\r\nnecessity for planting on land known to be free from the pest, and the\r\nimportance of not growing vegetables between the trees that will act as\r\na nurse crop for the disease.\r\n\r\nNeal recommends thorough drainage of the land and the application of\r\ntobacco dust mixed with unleached ashes or lime as the most promising\r\nremedial measures. He advises against the excessive use of ammoniacal\r\nmanures as producing a soft, succulent root growth favorable to the\r\ngrowth of the nematode. (See Bulletin No. 20, previously cited.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  G. F.

These spots are caused\r\nby a true rust fungus, _Uredo fici_ Cast. It occurs quite frequently\r\nwidely, and abundantly, but as it usually does not develop enough to be\r\nnoticeable until after the crop is ripe, it seems to do but little harm.\r\nNo attempt has been made to find a remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIG CERCOSPORA.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar injury to the leaves is known in Europe, caused by an\r\nentirely different fungus, _Cercospora bolleana_ (Thum) Sacc. It had not\r\nbeen observed in this country until the summer of 1895, when it was\r\nfound abundantly in Mississippi by S. M. Tracy. A _cercospora_, probably\r\nthe same species, is also reported from Florida by H. J. Webber. It\r\nprobably occurs quite commonly, but has been overlooked, its injuries\r\nbeing confounded with those caused by the _Uredo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DIE BACK.\r\n\r\nA dying of the young shoots in the fall and early winter is sometimes\r\nnoticed. This occurs before they can have been injured by severe cold\r\nand its cause is not known. It usually occurs in feeble trees, those\r\ninjured by previous winter killing or perhaps those suffering from root\r\nknot. A similar trouble is noted by A. F. Barron, of Chiswick, England,\r\n(The Garden, June 20, 1891, p. 577). He finds it occurring in trees\r\ngrown in pots, and says it is there seldom noticed in trees growing out\r\nof doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ROOT ROT.\r\n\r\nThe fungus _Ozonium auricomum_ Lk., which causes a root rot of cotton\r\nand of many other plants and trees, has been reported upon the fig,[4]\r\nbut the extent of damage caused by it is not known. Several other\r\nspecies of fungi are known to occur on the fig, but none of them can be\r\nclassed as disease-producing organisms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Farlow and Seymour, A Provisional Host-Index of the Fungi of the\r\n  United States, Part 3, p. 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nMuch confusion exists in the naming of fig varieties. They were first\r\nintroduced by the early French and Spanish settlers, and there have been\r\nmore or less frequent importations since. Trees from these various\r\nsources have been known under many local names, and it is probable that\r\nthere are now many more names recorded than we have varieties in\r\ncultivation. On the other hand, distinct varieties are often met with\r\nthat can not be named from published descriptions. In Louisiana and\r\nMississippi it is safe to say that nine-tenths of all the figs grown are\r\nof the Celeste variety. This is sometimes written Celestial, but among\r\ngrowers it is uniformly known as Celeste. The tree is hardy and very\r\nfruitful. The fruit is small, but it is one of the best in quality. When\r\nripe it is a light yellowish brown, tinged with violet. The flesh is\r\nlight red, delicate in texture, and very sweet and rich. A number of\r\nother varieties occur, but they are known under local names, such as\r\n“black fig” or “Spanish fig.” More attention has been paid to\r\nnomenclature and to the planting of different varieties in other parts\r\nof the South, but the Celeste is the favorite in nearly all localities.\r\n\r\nSome interesting papers on figs were read at the meeting of the American\r\nPomological Society, held in Florida in 1889, and in the published\r\nproceedings of the meeting the following 18 varieties are catalogued\r\namong the fruits recommended by the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _List of figs recommended by American Pomological Society._\r\n\r\nAlicante; Angelique—synonym, _Jaune Hative_; Brunswick; Blue Genoa;\r\nBlack Ischia; Brown Smyrna; Celeste; Green Ischia—synonyms, _White\r\nIschia_, _Green Italian_; Lemon; Violet, Long; Violet, Round; Nerii;\r\nPregussata; White Adriatic; White Marseillaise; White Genoa; Superfine\r\nde la Sausaye; Turkey—synonym, _Brown Turkey_.\r\n\r\nOn comparing this list with 11 others furnished by nurserymen and\r\nwriters on the fig, and taken at random from Texas, Louisiana, Georgia,\r\nand Florida sources, we find 14 of these names occurring more or less\r\nfrequently. Four are not mentioned at all, while 13 additional names\r\nappear, making a total of 31 varieties in the 12 lists. Celeste and\r\nBrown Turkey lead, being mentioned 11 times each; Adriatic, Lemon, and\r\nBrunswick come next, each occurring 8 times. White Marseillaise is\r\nmentioned 7 times; White Genoa and Green Ischia, 6 times; Black Ischia,\r\n5 times; and San Pedro, which is not in the American Pomological\r\nSociety’s list, occurs 4 times. We may perhaps conclude that these 10\r\nvarieties are the most generally grown in the South, but some of them\r\nare to be considered as nurserymen’s recent introductions from\r\nCalifornia, rather than as varieties in general use. They are\r\ncharacterized in the Pomological Society’s list as follows:\r\n\r\n ────────────────────┬──────────────┬────────────┬─────────┬────────────\r\n       Variety.      │   Season.    │   Color.   │Quality. │   Size.\r\n ────────────────────┼──────────────┼────────────┼─────────┼────────────\r\n Brunswick           │Early         │Violet      │First    │Very large.\r\n Black Ischia        │Medium        │Black       │  do     │Medium.\r\n Celestial [Celeste] │Early         │Pale violet │  do     │Small.\r\n Green Ischia        │  do          │Green       │  do     │Medium.\r\n Lemon               │  do          │Yellow      │  do     │  Do.\r\n White Adriatic      │              │            │         │\r\n White Marseillaise  │Medium        │White       │Second   │Medium.\r\n White Genoa         │  do          │  do        │  do     │Large.\r\n Turkey              │Early to late │Brown       │First    │  Do.\r\n San Pedro           │Not mentioned │            │         │\r\n ────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────┴─────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nOther lists agree in describing both White Adriatic and San Pedro as\r\nvery large white figs of the best quality and very desirable where they\r\nsucceed, but as being tender and nonfruitful in many locations. Celeste,\r\nBrown Turkey, and Brunswick are more uniformly commended for hardiness,\r\nfruitfulness, and general utility than any others.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The canning factories greatly prefer the Celeste, paying one-fourth\r\n  more for them than for larger, coarser kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 USES.\r\n\r\nAt present figs are mostly used for household purposes, comparatively\r\nfew being prepared for market. They are eaten fresh from the tree or are\r\nserved on the table with sugar and cream. They can also be stewed and\r\nmade into puddings and pies, and when canned or preserved they make an\r\nacceptable table delicacy throughout the year. On first tasting fresh\r\nfigs many people are disappointed and think they will not care for them,\r\nbut on further acquaintance nearly everyone learns to like them. If\r\npicked at all green the fig exudes a milky, acrid juice that has a rank,\r\ndisagreeable flavor. When fully ripe this disappears, and in learning to\r\neat figs one should choose only the ripest specimens. The beginner will\r\nfind eating them at the table with plenty of sugar and cream a pleasant\r\nintroduction. It is needless to commend this method to those who are\r\nacquainted with it.\r\n\r\nFor canning, figs should be picked when still firm enough to hold their\r\nshape. To secure the best results they require the use of more sugar\r\nthan do some other fruits. If undersweetened they seem tasteless and\r\nlacking in quality. The amount of sugar used and the method of procedure\r\nvary greatly in different households. A pound of sugar to 3 or 4 pounds\r\nof fruit would probably suit most tastes, though some prefer the regular\r\n“pound for pound” preserve. Ginger root or orange peel is sometimes\r\nadded to give variety of flavoring, and figs are often made into sweet\r\npickles by adding spices and vinegar. Figs are sometimes peeled before\r\ncanning, and this is considered to increase their delicacy of flavor.\r\nMore frequently, however, they are cooked unpeeled and with the stems\r\non, just as they come from the tree. They hold their shape better and\r\nlook more attractive when treated in this way, and the difference in\r\nflavor, if any, is very slight.\r\n\r\nFigs are occasionally dried for household use, but as they ripen at the\r\nSouth during the season of frequent summer showers, this is so\r\ntroublesome that it is not often attempted. A nice product could\r\ndoubtless be made by use of fruit evaporators, but these are seldom used\r\nfar South.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of home uses for the fig, its value as food for pigs and\r\nchickens should not be forgotten. Both are very fond of them, and on\r\nmany places the waste figs form an important item of their midsummer\r\ndiet. In fact, no cheaper food can be grown for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MARKETING FRESH FIGS.\r\n\r\nRipe figs are very perishable. To be marketed successfully they must be\r\nhandled with great care. It is best to pick them in the morning, while\r\nstill cool. They should be taken from the tree with the stem\r\nattached—great care being exercised not to bruise them in handling—and\r\nplaced in small, shallow baskets, in which they are to be marketed. In\r\nlarge packages their weight will bruise them badly. The ordinary quart\r\nstrawberry basket crate is a suitable package for marketing figs. They\r\nwill carry better, however, in flat trays, holding but a single layer.\r\nThis form of package is especially desirable for the larger varieties.\r\nFigs should hang on the tree until quite ripe and develop their full\r\nsweetness and flavor, but in this condition they are soft and perishable\r\nand must be consumed at once. For marketing at a distance it is\r\nnecessary to pick them while still quite firm. This is unfortunate, for\r\nthough they will soften and become quite edible, they will lack the fine\r\nquality of tree-ripened fruit. This fact will always be an obstacle to\r\nthe successful introduction of the fresh fig into distant markets. When\r\npicked in right condition the fruit will keep from twenty-four to\r\nthirty-six hours at the ordinary temperature and may be shipped short\r\ndistances by express. Figs ripen in midsummer when the weather is\r\nhottest, and this is one reason why they are so difficult to handle.\r\nLike other fruits they will keep longer at lower temperatures. They do\r\nwell under refrigeration, and by using refrigerator cars it is quite\r\npossible to put them on the more distant Northern markets in good\r\ncondition. This has been done experimentally in connection with other\r\nfruit shipments, but it is not often attempted. Fresh figs are not known\r\nor appreciated in Northern markets, and consequently the demand is too\r\nlimited to encourage shipments. It seems doubtful if the distant\r\nshipment of fresh figs will ever become a profitable business. The fruit\r\nis more perishable than any other that is generally marketed. It can be\r\nhandled only by the most careful and experienced persons, and even then\r\nit is not in a condition to show its best quality. Ripening in\r\nmidsummer, when the Northern markets are crowded with many well-known\r\nfruits, and not being specially attractive to the eye, fresh figs would\r\nat best gain favor slowly. The fact that many people do not care for\r\nthem at the first would be another obstacle in the way of their\r\npopularity. Moreover, the fig is a tedious crop to handle, when in\r\nproper condition for market. It is necessary to pick the trees over\r\ncarefully every day during the season, or much fruit will be overripe.\r\nWith large trees, this involves much labor; the acrid juice of the\r\nimmature figs eats into the fingers of the pickers and packers, while\r\nrainy weather occasions heavy loss by the cracking of the fruit, which\r\nrenders it unfit for market.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks, a limited demand would undoubtedly be\r\ncreated if the fig were placed regularly on the market, for many people\r\nare very fond of this fruit. It is quite possible that in sections\r\nespecially adapted to fig culture, and favored with rapid refrigerator\r\ntransportation, the shipment may become a business of importance. When a\r\nregular home market can be found, even at moderate prices, no crop is\r\nmore profitable, as the trees bear regularly and abundantly. The only\r\nhope for such a home market, except in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nlarge cities, is in increased use by canners.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CANNING FACTORIES.\r\n\r\nEveryone likes canned figs. The taste does not have to be educated, as\r\nis often the case with the fresh fruit. The factories at Biloxi, Miss.,\r\nand at New Orleans, La., appreciate this fact, and for several years\r\nhave been putting increasing quantities of the canned product on the\r\nmarket. Up to the panic of 1893 the demand for these goods was very\r\nactive, and the canners paid as high as 4 cents per pound for the fresh\r\nfigs and could not get enough to fill their orders. Since then the\r\ndemand for all luxuries has fallen off and factories have curtailed\r\ntheir packing, but have not materially reduced the price of the product,\r\nwhich has always been very high. There seems to be no reason, aside from\r\nthe larger quantity of sugar required, why figs should not be grown and\r\ncanned as cheaply as peaches. If this were done the demand would soon be\r\nvery large. It is in this direction, if at all, that there seems to be\r\nan opening for the building up of the fig industry in the South.\r\n\r\nThe processes used by the factories in canning figs differ somewhat from\r\nhousehold methods. They also differ among themselves. Each factory has\r\nworked out a plan of its own, the details of which are regarded to some\r\nextent as trade secrets. In one factory, whose product has been much\r\nadmired, the process consists in boiling the fruit at first in a very\r\nlight sirup, allowing it to cool, and then transferring it with\r\nsuccessive heatings and coolings to sirups of gradually increasing\r\ndensity. The whole process requires nearly two days. In the finished\r\nproduct the fig, while holding its shape perfectly, has become partially\r\ntransparent, and as the final sirup is clear and free from sediment the\r\nfruit is very attractive.",
