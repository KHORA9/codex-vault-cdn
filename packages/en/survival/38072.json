It is\r\nknown as the Tower of the Winds; but as a matter of fact, the citizens\r\nof Athens used it to tell the hour of the day and the seasonal position\r\nof the sun. It was a public timepiece. It served as a huge sun dial.\r\nWater from a spring on the hillside filled the basins of a water clock\r\nin the basement of the Tower. And so, whether the day was clear or\r\ncloudy the measure of the outflow of water indicated the time elapsed.\r\nAlso there were markings or dials on each of the eight walls of the\r\ntemple, and the position of the shadow of a marker indicated the\r\nseasonal advance or retreat of the sun as it moved north from the time\r\nof the winter solstice and then south after the summer solstice.\r\n\r\nThe sun is not an accurate time keeper and no one to-day runs his\r\nbusiness or keeps engagements on sun time. But the old Athenians were\r\nquite content to do so; and their Tower served excellently for their\r\nneeds. And they did what we moderns fail to do, namely, give distinctive\r\nnames to the winds. They represented figuratively the characteristics of\r\nthe weather as the wind blew from each of the eight cardinal directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. THE TOWER OF THE WINDS\r\n\r\nErected in Athens, on the north side of the Acropolis, B. C. 150]\r\n\r\nThe allegorical figures of the winds used in this little book are\r\nreproductions of the eight bas-reliefs in the library of the Blue Hill\r\nObservatory, placed there by the late Professor A. Lawrence Rotch. They\r\nare copied from the frieze of the Tower of the Winds at Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAMES OF THE WINDS\r\n\r\n\r\nBoreas, the north wind, is perhaps the most important of all winds. At\r\nAthens this a cold, boisterous wind from the mountains of Thrace. The\r\nnoise of the gusts is so loud that the Greek sculptor symbolized the\r\ntumult by placing a conch shell in the mouth of Boreas. His modern\r\nnamesake, the Bora of the Adriatic, is the same noisy, blustering, cold\r\nwind-rush from the north.\r\n\r\nThe northeast wind Kaikias is a trifle more pleasant looking than\r\nBoreas, but still not much to brag about. Master of the squall and\r\nthunderstorm, he carries in his shield an ample supply of hailstones,\r\nready to spill them on defenseless humanity. He might well serve as the\r\npatron saint of air raiders dropping their bombs on helpless humans\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nApheliotes, the east wind, is a graceful youth, with arms full of\r\nflowers, fruit and wheat. Naturally this was a favorite wind, blowing in\r\nfrom the sea, with frequent light showers. Some of us who dwell on the\r\nAtlantic Coast, in more northern latitudes than Athens, do not always\r\nregard with favor the east wind, associating it with chilly, damp and\r\nsombre weather. Yet it is the harbinger of good--tempering the cold of\r\nwinter and the heat of summer. It is an angel of mercy in mid-summer\r\nwhen the temperature is above the nineties and there is no air stirring.\r\nThen it is, that we all welcome the refreshing wind from the sea.\r\n\r\nEuros, the southeast wind, and neighbor to Apheliotes, is a cross old\r\nfellow, intent on the business of cloud making. He alone of all the\r\nwinds carries nothing in his hands. In the New Testament he becomes\r\nEuroclydon, wind of the waves. He is no friend of the sailor; and the\r\nseasick traveler prays to be rid of his company.\r\n\r\nThe figure on the south face of the tower, Notos, is the master of the\r\nwarm rain. He carries with him a water jar which has just been emptied.\r\nCompare his light flowing robes and half-clad neck and arms with the\r\nclose fitting jacket of old Boreas. At his shrine, hydraulic engineers\r\nwell might worship.\r\n\r\nNext, the Mariner's wind, Lips, the southwest favoring breeze bringing\r\nthe ships speedily into harbor; yes, into that Piraeus, famed in classic\r\nhistory. Incidentally it is the southwest wind which differentiates the\r\nclimate of Great Britain from that of Labrador. This wind makes\r\nNorthwest Europe habitable; while on the other side of the Atlantic, in\r\nsimilar latitudes, but under the influence of prevailing northwest\r\nwinds, we find Labrador--a section certainly misnamed, for it is not the\r\nabode of farmers, as the name implies--but barren and bleak. What a\r\ndifference it would make thruout this region if the Gulf Stream\r\ncontinued north, close to the shore, and the prevailing winds were _from\r\nthe east_. Our North Atlantic Coast would then be _the land of zephyrs_,\r\nusing the word in the sense of pleasant, gentle winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. BOREAS--THE NORTH WIND]\r\n\r\nZephyros, the west wind, is represented as a graceful youth, scantily\r\nclad, with his arms filled with flowers. In Greece this wind traversed\r\nthe Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Corinth before reaching Athens. It is\r\nquite unlike our west wind which blows across a continent, and is\r\ncontinuously robbed of its water vapor on the long passage. The Ionian\r\nwind is pleasantly moist and refreshing.\r\n\r\nLast of all, but by no means least important, is Skiron, lord of gusty\r\nnorthwest gales. Freezing in winter, parching in summer, he carries with\r\nhim a brazen fire basket and spills a generous stream of hot air on all\r\nbelow. His husky Highness might not inappropriately adorn legislative\r\nhalls and editorial sanctums. He would displace the blindfolded lady\r\nholding scales very much out of balance. Think of the deep significance\r\nof his presence.\r\n\r\nIn our country the northwest is of all winds, except the west, most\r\npersistent. For 1600 hours in a year, this wind is with us. Joining\r\nforces with the west wind, these directions prevail one third of the\r\ntime. These northwest-west winds also have the greatest speed and\r\ngustiness. The climate of the United States is essentially determined by\r\nthe prevalence of the north, northwest and west winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORECASTING THE WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn old days, the _haruspices_ (for this is what the Romans called\r\nweather men in the days of Caesar) proclaimed the will of the gods by\r\nconsulting the entrails of some freshly killed animal. Evidently these\r\nharuspices did not always make correct forecasts; for there were some\r\nRomans who openly questioned their worth. Cato, the Censor, is on record\r\nas saying \"that he wondered how one haruspex could look another in the\r\nface without laughing!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. KAIKIAS--THE NORTHEAST WIND]\r\n\r\nThe modern professional forecaster would scorn to consult the entrails.\r\nThere are however many amateur forecasters who foretell weather by their\r\naches and rheumatic pains. Probably there is a high correlation factor\r\nbetween body sensations and dampness; and some individuals are quite\r\nsensitive to changes in both relative and absolute humidity. This,\r\nhowever, does not always mean that a storm is approaching. Humidity or\r\ndampness is only one factor and may be quite local, whereas most storms\r\nare wide-spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER MAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe official forecaster consults a daily weather map and certain\r\nauxiliary maps which show changes in pressure and temperature for twelve\r\nhours or more. He examines closely the contours of pressure as shown on\r\nthe map. The synoptic map, as it is called, because it is a glance at\r\nweather conditions over a large area at one and the same moment, is a\r\nmap on which are plotted pressure, temperature, wind direction, velocity\r\nand rainfall. The lines of equal pressure or isobars generally curve and\r\ninclose what is known as a cyclonic centre, or depression or LOW. The\r\narrows point in, but not exactly toward the centre of the depression.\r\n\r\nOn the map there will probably appear also an area of high pressure\r\nwhere the surface air flows leisurely outward and away from the place of\r\nhighest pressure. Such an area is called an anticyclone, a word first\r\nused by Sir Francis Galton in 1863 to designate not only high pressure,\r\nbut general flow of the air in a reversed or opposite direction to that\r\nof the low area or cyclone. The word cyclone was first used by\r\nPiddington in 1843 in describing the flow of the air in the typhoons of\r\nthe East Indian Seas. It is from the Greek and literally means the coils\r\nof a serpent. The word cyclone must possess some special merit in the\r\nminds of journalists for it is quite commonly misused for tornado in\r\ndescriptions of the smaller and more destructive storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOW\r\n\r\n\r\nCyclone is simply the generic name for a large rotating air mass. It is\r\na barometric depression or LOW and is characterized by a flow of air\r\ninward and around a moving centre. The air circulation is\r\ncounter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the south.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the earth stopped rotating and there was no planetary\r\ncirculation, with the great west-moving trades and east-moving\r\n\"westerlies,\" the arrows on the weather map would all point directly\r\ntoward the centre of the LOW; but, as things are, there are some very\r\ngood reasons why air can not move directly into a LOW, that is at right\r\nangles to the isobars.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the weather map does not indicate the true flow of the air,\r\nfor observations of the wind made at the ground tell only a part of the\r\nstory of the balance which the flowing air must maintain under the\r\naction of various forces, such as gravitation, rotational deflection,\r\ncentrifugal tendency, and the various expansion and compression forces.\r\n\r\nThe winds near the ground are modified both in velocity and direction by\r\nfriction. The free flow is often interfered with by topography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE AIR FLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOne must rise above the ground some distance to get the true air flow,\r\nor what is known as the gradient wind, the flow which balances the\r\ngradient, i.e. a flow along the isobars. The gradient velocity is found\r\nabout 300 metres above the ground, and the gradient direction a little\r\nhigher. The lower clouds as a rule indicate true wind values very well;\r\nand so, it is desirable in studying winds to use cloud directions and\r\nvelocities rather than surface values. In cloud work a nephoscope is\r\nessential. The unaided eye, unless properly shielded, suffers from the\r\nglare of a sunlit sky; and moreover, there are no fixed points or\r\nreferences. A black mirror, with suitable sighting rods and measuring\r\ndevices, enables an observer to follow the cloud, estimate its height\r\nand determine with accuracy the direction from which it is moving. There\r\nis an average difference of 30 degrees between the cloud direction and\r\nthe surface wind; the upper direction being more to the right. At times\r\nthe directions may be opposite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. APHELIOTES--THE EAST WIND]\r\n\r\nIt may seem surprising but few of us, except at sunrise and sunset,\r\nreally see what is going on in cloud land.\r\n\r\nSome meteorologists hold that the circulation of air 3000 to 5000\r\nmetres above the ground controls the path and perhaps the intensity of\r\nstorms. It is therefore important to know something of the flow at high\r\nlevels if we would improve the forecasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS OF MAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather map fails to indicate what shifts of direction and changes\r\nin velocity are likely to occur. The forecaster tries to anticipate\r\nthese, but he bases his conclusions chiefly upon an expected movement of\r\nthe low area; using the accumulated records of the paths of past storms.\r\nBut each storm is in reality a law unto itself; and while we know\r\nsomething of the relations between pressure and flow of the air; as yet\r\nwe know very little about the relations of wind and weather. The problem\r\nis complicated by the behavior of the load of water vapor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. EUROS--THE SOUTHEAST WIND]\r\n\r\nThe Chief Forecaster of one of the great national weather services\r\nrecently wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Despite the fact that maps have now been drawn day by day for over\r\n     half a century, we may safely say that no two maps have been\r\n     identical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that so much attention has been given to the\r\ncyclone or depression or LOW, and comparatively little to the HIGH or\r\nanticyclone. For we are now beginning to understand that while there may\r\nseem at first to be nothing specially noteworthy about a mass of air\r\nwhere the pressure varies from 1020 to 1040 kilobars, that is, 2 to 4\r\nper cent _above_ a standard atmosphere, with isobars irregularly curved\r\nand feeble surface winds, yet the anticyclone is more important than the\r\ncyclone in determining weather sequence; for the progressive motion of\r\nthe cyclone depends largely upon the strength of the anticyclone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN STORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Napier Shaw, who has written much on the weather of the British\r\nIsles, may be quoted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Anyone who is interested in the weather is always on the lookout\r\n     for 'lows' and is very keen to know whether he is going to be on\r\n     the south of the centre or the north of it. He is, of course,\r\n     interested in the anticyclone too, because as long as an\r\n     anticyclone is there, there cannot be a depression; but it is the\r\n     depression which has the life and movement about it, giving it a\r\n     claim to the attention of everybody who wants to know what the\r\n     weather and its changes are going to be.\r\n\r\n     \"This has been recognized from the very earliest days of weather\r\n     maps with isobars. The depressions which pass over our shores\r\n     (Great Britain) mostly come from the west. Some of them come all\r\n     the way from America; one or two have been traced from the west\r\n     coast of Africa and so have crossed the Atlantic twice, first to\r\n     the westward and then to the eastward. Some have come all the way\r\n     from a sort of parent 'low' in the North Pacific Ocean. So general\r\n     is the tendency for 'lows' to go eastward that it was thought at\r\n     one time, particularly by the 'New York Herald,' that their\r\n     departure from the American Coast and subsequent arrival on our own\r\n     shores could be notified by cable, and we (the British) might thus\r\n     be forewarned of their approach, some three or four days in\r\n     advance. The attempt was made by the 'New York Herald' acting in\r\n     co-operation with the Meteorological Offices of the United Kingdom\r\n     and France. But a depression keeps to no beaten track; it has as\r\n     many paths for its centre as there are lines in a bundle of hay.\r\n     Though groups can be picked out there are many strays, and,\r\n     moreover, the depression changes its shape and intensity while it\r\n     travels, so that if you lose sight of it for a day you cannot be at\r\n     all sure of its identity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. NOTOS--THE SOUTH WIND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCONTINENTAL STORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is so much uncertainty in forecasting the path of a disturbance\r\nat sea, how much more uncertain must it be on land? Elaborate statistics\r\nof the average daily movement of various types of storms have been\r\nofficially published. The average speed of storms (not wind speeds)\r\nacross the United States is 11 metres per second or 25 miles an hour.\r\nStorms travel more rapidly in winter than in summer, about half again as\r\nfast; that is, summer storms travel 20 miles, and winter storms 30\r\nmiles, an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. LIPS--THE SOUTHWEST WIND]\r\n\r\nThe paths vary widely; from the Gulf storms moving northeast and West\r\nIndian hurricanes recurving on the southern coast, to the storms from\r\nAlberta and the west which move south and east. Ten types of storms,\r\nclassified according to the place of origin, are recognized by the\r\nofficial forecasters of the United States. These are North Pacific,\r\nAlberta, Northern Rocky Mountain, Colorado, Central, South Pacific,\r\nTexas, East Gulf, South Atlantic and West Indian Hurricanes. A better\r\nnomenclature would be (1) Alberta, (2) Washington, (3) Kootenay, (4)\r\nUtah, (5) Kansas, (6) California, (7) Texas, (8) Louisiana, (9)\r\nFlorida, and (10) Hurricanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHURRICANES\r\n\r\n\r\nType 10 is the general class of tropical storms occurring chiefly in the\r\nsummer and fall which, drifting west, slowly work northward. Similar\r\nstorms are the typhoons and baguios of the East Indian and China Seas.\r\n\r\nThe path and point of recurvature will be determined by the position of\r\nthe Bermuda Hyperbar, that is, the seasonal anticyclone of the Atlantic.\r\nThis accounts for the swinging east and north of these tracks as the\r\nseason progresses; for the hyperbar is slowly displaced east, the\r\nmaximum displacement occurring in September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASE MAP BY GOODE\r\n\r\nFIG. 8. ALL STORMS LEAD TO NEW ENGLAND]\r\n\r\nIndividual anticyclones also influence individual hurricanes. Thus a\r\nhurricane passing west over Havana, will go farther west if a vigorous\r\n\"high\" is spreading southeast over the Gulf States. And when this \"high\"\r\npasses seaward, the hurricane will work around the southwest quadrant of\r\nthe \"high,\" recurving and moving northeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORM RENDEZVOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nAltho storms originate or are first detected in nine different sections,\r\nit is a fact worth mentioning that they all leave the United States in\r\nthe vicinity of New England or Nova Scotia. Some of the southern\r\ndepressions starting near the coast, pass to sea south of New York, but\r\nin general an observer standing on Plymouth Rock can virtually encompass\r\nwithin a radius of 500 kilometres, 300 miles, the paths of ninety per\r\ncent of the storms that traverse the country.\r\n\r\nThus a storm that originates in Texas (7) will probably pass close to\r\nCape Cod. Likewise, types (3) and (5); while the other types may pass a\r\nlittle to the north or south. See Chart, Paths of Storms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORM PATHS\r\n\r\n\r\nForecasting then would seem to be very easy; for one would only have to\r\nknow the place of origin of the storm and the rate of travel, to\r\nforetell exactly the time of arrival. Unfortunately these are only the\r\naverage paths; and as with most mean values, represent a value not often\r\nexperienced in fact. These paths then are not paths which any given\r\nstorm will follow. One must recall the story of the operating surgeon\r\nwho gave the average age of his patients in the operating room as 35.\r\nThere were but two patients, one 69 years old and the other 1 year old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. ZEPHYROS--THE WEST WIND]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the path of any individual depression depends upon\r\nseveral factors, some of which are:--the prevailing eastward drift of\r\nthe air; the extent and motion of some anticyclone advancing before the\r\n\"LOW\"; the duration and speed of relatively dry cold tongues of air from\r\nthe north; and the supply of water vapor brought from southern waters by\r\nsouth winds. A depression can make little headway if to the north or\r\neast the normal path is blocked by what is known as a stagnant \"HIGH.\"\r\nSo therefore, if the anticyclone is a slow mover, a Texas storm, which\r\nwould normally pass not far from southern New England, may be deflected\r\nfarther north than when the HIGH moved rapidly east. So too, with the\r\nstorms which originate in the western part of the country. A slow moving\r\nHIGH will prevent the LOW following it, from moving east at a normal\r\nrate along the usual path.\r\n\r\nAnticyclones then, are the real weather controls. There are various\r\ntypes, but all drift from the north or west. Occasionally they enter the\r\ncountry from the Pacific, but the great majority come from Alberta and\r\nmove leisurely southeast, often reaching the South Atlantic States; but\r\nmore frequently recurving and passing to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAGNANT HIGHS\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHS are sometimes reinforced and this results in what is called a\r\nstagnant HIGH. A good illustration of such a slow moving HIGH and its\r\nconsequences occurred during the last week of January, 1922.\r\n\r\nA surge of cold air from Alberta or farther north reached the\r\ninternational boundary January 21st and spread slowly eastward, reaching\r\nthe Great Lakes on the 24th and the St. Lawrence Valley two days later.\r\nThen seemingly it halted or moved slowly westward, retrograding. In\r\nthree days, that is, on the 29th, the centre of the HIGH was apparently\r\n500 miles _west_ of where it had been on the 27th. After the 29th it\r\nfollowed a normal track, moving slowly southeast, reaching the Atlantic\r\nnear Long Island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a depression on the south coast of Texas on the 25th, moved\r\nacross the Gulf of Mexico, passing over Southern Florida on the 27th and\r\nadvanced steadily northeast, reaching Cape Hatteras in 24 hours. Owing\r\nto the presence of the anticyclone referred to above, the depression\r\nrecurved off Hatteras. The result was a memorable snow storm in Northern\r\nVirginia and Maryland. At 8 p.m. January 27th, there had been a fall of\r\n5 cms. (2 inches). Within the following twenty hours the average depth\r\nin the city of Washington was 66 cms. (26 inches). The weight of the\r\nsnow caused the collapse of the roof of the Knickerbocker Theatre and\r\nthe death of 97 persons.\r\n\r\nThe total snowfall in various coast cities was:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Raleigh         24 cms.*\r\n     Richmond        48  \"\r\n     Washington      71  \"\r\n     Baltimore       67  \"\r\n     Wilmington      46  \"\r\n     Philadelphia    31  \"\r\n     Trenton         27  \"\r\n     New York        18  \"\r\n     New Haven        8  \"\r\n     Boston           1  \"\r\n\r\n     *Note: To convert to inches multiply by 0.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table shows clearly how the snow was formed. On the east side of the\r\nLOW a stream of air, relatively warm, carried a load of water vapor,\r\napproximately 13 grams in each cubic metre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASE MAP BY GOODE\r\n\r\nFIG. 10. PATHS OF HIGH AND LOW, GREAT SNOW STORM OF JANUARY 27-28, 1922]\r\n\r\nThis current was steered around the north side of the LOW and met the\r\nnorth-northeast wind. Under the new conditions the air saturated could\r\nhold only 2 or 3 grams; and so condensation and heavy precipitation\r\nresulted. The region of maximum snowfall was near Washington, and it\r\nwill be seen that there is a proportional decrease north and south. The\r\nsnowfall at Washington was the heaviest ever known at that city.\r\n\r\nUnlike most storms, there was no strong cold northwest wind blowing into\r\nthe depression. The temperature rose slowly. It was less a contrast of\r\nwinds than a steady slow outward push of the anticyclone, and the\r\nconsequent turning of the path of the cyclone eastward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS OF FORECASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nBuys Ballot's Law.\r\n\r\n\"If you stand with your back to the wind the pressure decreases toward\r\nyour left, and increases toward your right.\"\r\n\r\nFor navigators, this law is more generally expressed in the words of the\r\nHydrographic Office on \"Cyclonic Storms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the wind circulates counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere,\r\nthe rule in that hemisphere is to face the wind, and the storm centre\r\nwill be at the right hand. If the wind traveled in exact circles, the\r\ncentre would be eight points (90 degrees) to the right when looking\r\ndirectly in the wind's eye. But the wind follows a more or less spiral\r\npath inward which brings the centre from eight to twelve points (90 to\r\n135 degrees), to the right of the wind. The centre will bear more nearly\r\neight points from the direction of the lower clouds than from the\r\nsurface wind.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. SKIRON--THE NORTHWEST WIND]\r\n\r\nThe law given on the preceding page is named after C. H. D. Buys\r\nBallott, a Dutch meteorologist. It was announced in a paper published in\r\nthe _Comptes rendus_ in 1857. Two American writers on the Winds, J. H.\r\nCoffin and William Ferrell, had however earlier found the law to hold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile most of us study storms from a window at home and are not called\r\nupon to handle a ship in a storm, yet it may not be out of place to\r\ninclude here the diagram of the winds in an ideal storm and give the\r\nrules for maneuvering. See Figure 12. The Winds in an Idealized Storm.\r\nThe rules apply only to storms in the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\"_Right or dangerous semicircle_,--Steamers: Bring the wind on the\r\nstarboard bow, make as much way as possible, and if obliged to heave-to,\r\ndo so head to sea. Sailing vessels: Keep close-hauled on the starboard\r\ntack, make as much way as possible, and if obliged to heave-to, do so on\r\nthe starboard tack.\r\n\r\n_Left or navigable semicircle_,--Steam and sailing vessels: Bring the\r\nwind on the starboard quarter, note the course and hold it. If obliged\r\nto heave-to, steamers may do so stern to sea; sailing vessels on the\r\nport tack.\r\n\r\n_On the storm track in front of center_,--Steam and sailing vessels:\r\nBring the wind two points on the starboard quarter, note the course and\r\nhold it, and run for the left semicircle, and when in that semicircle\r\nmanoeuvre as above.\r\n\r\nOn the storm track, in rear of center,--Avoid the center by the best\r\npracticable route, having due regard to the tendency of cyclones to\r\nrecurve to the southward and eastward.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE\r\n\r\nFIG. 12. THE WINDS IN AN IDEALIZED STORM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND AND ALTITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of the turning of the wind with altitude.\r\n\r\nA casual observation of the lower clouds where no means of measuring\r\nsmall angles is available will not usually show any difference between\r\nthe motion of the clouds and the surface wind; but with the upper clouds\r\nthe case is different, and one readily detects a difference.\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand observations with various agencies, such as kites and\r\npilot balloons and more especially measurements made with theodolites\r\nand nephoscopes, show that there is a definite twist to the right with\r\nelevation. The amount of the deflection is shown in Figure 13. Turning\r\nof the Wind with Altitude. Here the average yearly values are given for\r\ndirections and velocities. Thus if the mean wind direction at Blue Hill\r\nis from a point a little to the north of west, 306 grads or 275 degrees,\r\nand the mean velocity 7 metres per second; the clouds at 1000 metres\r\nelevation will move from 312 or 280 degrees and at a speed of\r\napproximately 11 metres per second (24 miles an hour).\r\n\r\nThese however, are average values. In individual cases the difference\r\nbetween surface winds and stratus clouds may be considerably greater. It\r\nmay be as much as 180 degrees; that is, the cloud may move directly\r\nopposite to the wind. In general there will be a difference of 10 to 20\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND AND RAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of wind direction, approximate cooling and rain.\r\n\r\nWhen the lower clouds are moving from the north or northwest, without\r\nsharply defined edges, the LOW is east or northeast of the observer; and\r\nrain or snow is not likely unless there is a rapidly falling\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURNING OF WIND WITH ALTITUDE, BLUE HILL\r\n\r\nFIG. 13. TURNING OF WIND WITH ALTITUDE]\r\n\r\nWhen a stream of warm air with a high absolute humidity flows north on\r\nthe east side of a LOW, and a cold northwest wind follows quickly after\r\nthe LOW, rain or snow may be expected.\r\n\r\nAny rapid chilling of warm, moist air produces cloudiness and rain or\r\nsnow; but a cold stream blowing into a warm area will not produce as\r\nmuch rain as a warm stream blowing into a cold area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average duration of wind from various directions is as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom the north about 16 hours each week; from the northeast, the same;\r\nfrom the east, 11 hours; from the southeast, 10 hours; from the south,\r\n24 hours; from the southwest, 27 hours; from the west, 33 hours; and\r\nfrom the northwest 31 hours.\r\n\r\nDuring an individual disturbance lasting about 36 hours, we may have 8\r\nhours of southwest wind; 4 hours of west wind, backing during the next 4\r\nhours to south; 2 hours of south wind; 2 hours of southeast wind; 2\r\nhours of east wind; 8 hours northeast wind and 4 hours north wind, 2\r\nhours northwest, when it may be considered that a new pressure\r\ndistribution prevails.\r\n\r\nThe above values hold only for a storm moving with normal velocity. LOWS\r\nare often blocked by slow moving HIGHS in advance. In such cases the\r\nduration of east winds is greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINDS OF A YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the marked increase in the prevalence of\r\nnorthwest and west winds during winter months, the decrease in north\r\nwinds during July, the increase in northeast winds in May, also in east\r\nwinds; the increase of south and southwest winds in July; and the\r\nfalling off of southeast winds in December. See Table, page 72.\r\n\r\nIn cities near the Atlantic Coast, a continuance of northeast wind,\r\nespecially in the fall and winter months, results in frequent altho not\r\nnecessarily heavy rains. On the other hand a period of continued\r\nnorthwest and west wind is a dry period.\r\n\r\nIn summer, southeast and east winds bring fog and cooler weather; while\r\nsouthwest winds are favorable for the development of thunderstorms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDS OF A YEAR\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--Number of Hours the Wind Blows from Different Directions.\r\n\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    Jan.

VELOCITY OF SUMMER AND WINTER WINDS IN METRES\r\nPER SECOND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA BREEZE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the weather has been clear and moderately warm for two or more\r\ndays, and the winds are light and variable, there may occur on the third\r\nday a moderate wind from the east, known as the sea-breeze. This occurs\r\nduring anticyclonic conditions. Preceding the sea-breeze, the winds are\r\nvery light, there are no clouds, and the temperature rises rapidly\r\nduring the forenoon. This heating is due to a slow dynamic compression\r\nas the air slowly descends and the surface air does not flow away. There\r\nis no cooling because there is no evaporation due to air movement. The\r\nabsolute humidity is low, often less than ten grams per cubic metre.\r\nCumulus clouds do not form because there is no uplift of the lower air\r\nand consequently no chance for condensation of whatever water vapor may\r\nbe present. No thunder-heads form notwithstanding the heat. The heat,\r\nwhile dry, is nevertheless extremely trying to men and animals. Relief\r\ncomes in the early hours of the afternoon by the arrival of the\r\nsea-breeze.\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation of the origin of the sea-breeze is that the land\r\nbeing excessively warm, the air over a relatively cool ocean moves in to\r\ntake the place of the warm and therefore lighter air, which it is\r\nassumed has risen. Unfortunately for this explanation, the air over the\r\nland has _not_ risen; but on the contrary is falling slowly. Again the\r\nsea-breeze does not begin at the place where the temperature contrast is\r\ngreatest, namely, just inside the shore line; but comes in from the sea.\r\nNor does the flow extend far inland, which would be the case if there\r\nwere up-rising currents. The sea-breeze is very shallow, generally not\r\nextending upward more than 200 metres, and often not above 100 metres.\r\nIt does not penetrate far inland, as a rule not more than 15\r\nkilometres, 9 miles.\r\n\r\nThe sea-breeze is probably caused by a slow descent of dry, warm air, on\r\nan incline sloping from northeast to southwest. As it reaches the\r\nsurface it is twisted more to the right; that is, becomes an east wind.\r\nIt carries inland with it some of the air over the ocean which is much\r\ncooler and heavily saturated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUGGY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain days, more noticeable in summer than at other times,\r\nwhen the air is heavily laden with water vapor; and there is little or\r\nno cooling of the body due to evaporation. We perspire freely but as the\r\nsweat does not evaporate, there is a constantly increasing amount of\r\nwater on the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. BLUE HILL OBSERVATORY DURING ICE STORM, NOVEMBER\r\n29-30, 1922]\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether a question of temperature, for another day may have\r\nas high or even higher temperature. It is essentially a matter of\r\nventilation. On muggy days we are somewhat in the condition of the\r\nunfortunate prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. They did not die by\r\npoisoning, as has generally been accepted, that is, lack of sufficient\r\noxygen and an excess of carbon dioxide; but because they were unable to\r\nkeep the skin sufficiently cool. There was no ventilation; no movement\r\nof the air and the body became over-heated and exhaustion followed. No\r\nmatter how much water there may be on the skin if the surrounding space\r\nis saturated, one feels oppressed. A vigorous fanning of the air helps\r\nevaporation and cools us. That is why a brisk northwest wind routs a\r\nmuggy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTILIAN DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hay wrote of such days spent in Spain. We who live in a land where\r\nthe winds are more boisterous, occasionally experience what we call a\r\nperfect day. Such days have easterly winds of two metres per second or\r\nless than five miles an hour. The temperature is midway between freezing\r\nand normal body temperature or about 70 deg. F. The relative humidity is\r\napproximately 75% and the absolute humidity 12 grams per cubic metre.\r\nThe table on page 72 explains the paucity of perfect days. The gusty,\r\nboisterous winds, Skiron and Zephyros, blow too frequently.\r\n\r\nPerhaps certain of our national characteristics may be traceable to\r\nthis flow of the air and our climatic environment.",
