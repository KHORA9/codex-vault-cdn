MÈGE-MOURIÈS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the interest that has been recently excited on the\r\nsubject of bread reform, we have, says the London _Miller_, translated the\r\ninteresting contribution of H. Mège-Mouriès to the Imperial and Central\r\nSociety of Agriculture of France, and subsequently published in a separate\r\nform in 1860, on \"Wheat and Wheat Bread,\" with the illustration prepared\r\nby the author for the contribution. The author says: \"I repeat in this\r\npamphlet the principal facts put forth in the notes issued by me, and in\r\nthe reports furnished by Mr. Chevreul to the Academy of Science, from 1853\r\nup to 1860.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of the structure of the wheat berry, its chemical composition,\r\nits alimentary value, its preservation, etc., is not alone of interest to\r\nscience, agriculture, and industry, but it is worthy of attracting the\r\nattention of governments, for this study, in its connection to political\r\neconomy, is bound up with the fate and the prosperity of nations. Wheat has\r\nbeen cultivated from time immemorial. At first it was roughly crushed and\r\nconsumed in the form of a thick soup, or in cakes baked on an ordinary\r\nhearth. Many centuries before the Christian era the Egyptians were\r\nacquainted with the means of making fermented or leavened bread; afterwards\r\nthis practice spread into Greece, and it is found in esteem at Rome two\r\ncenturies B.C.; from Rome the new method was introduced among the Gauls,\r\nand it is found to-day to exist almost the same as it was practiced at that\r\nperiod, with the exception, of course, of the considerable improvements\r\nintroduced in the baking and grinding.\r\n\r\nSince the fortunate idea was formed of transforming the wheat into bread,\r\nthis grain has always produced white bread, and dark or brown bread, from\r\nwhich the conclusion was drawn that it must necessarily make white bread\r\nand brown bread; on the other hand, the flours, mixed with bran, made a\r\nbrownish, doughy, and badly risen bread, and it was therefore concluded\r\nthat the bran, by its color, produced this inferior bread. From this error,\r\naccepted as a truth, the most contradictory opinions of the most opposite\r\nprocesses have arisen, which are repeated at the present day in the art of\r\nseparating as completely as possible all the tissues of the wheat, and of\r\nextracting from the grain only 70 per cent of flour fit for making white\r\nbread. It is, however, difficult for the observer to admit that a small\r\nquantity of the thin yellow envelope can, by a simple mingling with the\r\ncrumb of the loaf, color it brown, and it is still more difficult to admit\r\nthat the actual presence of these envelopes can without decomposition\r\nrender bread doughy, badly raised, sticky, and incapable of swelling in\r\nwater. On the other hand, although some distinguished chemists deny or\r\nexalt the nutritive properties of bran, agriculturists, taking practical\r\nobservation as proof, attribute to that portion of the grain a\r\nphysiological action which has nothing in common with plastic alimentation,\r\nand prove that animals weakened by a too long usage of dry fodder, are\r\nrestored to health by the use of bran, which only seems to act by its\r\npresence, since the greater portion of it, as already demonstrated by Mr.\r\nPoggiale, is passed through with the excrement.\r\n\r\nWith these opinions, apparently so opposed, it evidently results that there\r\nis an unknown factor at the bottom of the question; it is the nature of\r\nthis factor I wish to find out, and it was after the discovery that I\r\nwas able to explain the nature of brown bread, and its _role_ in the\r\nalimentation of animals. We have then to examine the causes of the\r\nproduction of brown bread, to state why white bread kills animals fed\r\nexclusively on it, while bread mixed with bran makes them live. We have to\r\nexplain the phenomena of panification, the operations of grinding, and to\r\nexplain the means of preparing a bread more economical and more favorable\r\nto health. To explain this question clearly and briefly we must first be\r\nacquainted with the various substances forming the berry, their nature,\r\ntheir position, and their properties. This we shall do with the aid of the\r\nillustration given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF A GRAIN OF WHEAT MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF DIAGRAM.\r\n\r\n1.--Superficial Coating of the Epidermis, severed at the Crease of\r\n    the Kernel.\r\n2.--Section of Epidermis, Averages of the Weight of the Whole Grain, ½ %.\r\n3.--Epicarp,                 do.            do.           do.      1   %.\r\n4.--Endocarp,                do.            do.           do.      1 ½ %.\r\n5.--Testa or Episperm,       do.            do.           do.      2   %.\r\n6.--Embryo Membrane (with imaginary spaces in white on both sides\r\n    to make it distinct).\r\n7.\\              /  Glutonous Cells     \\\r\n8. > Endosperm  <   containing           >  do.           do.     90   %.\r\n9./              \\  Farinaccous Matter  /\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL STRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF WHEAT.\r\n\r\nThe figure represents the longitudinal cut of a grain of wheat; it was made\r\nby taking, with the aid of the microscope and of photography, the drawing\r\nof a large quantity of fragments, which, joined together at last, produced\r\nthe figure of the entire cut. These multiplied results were necessary to\r\nappreciate the insertion of the teguments and their nature in every part\r\nof the berry; in this long and difficult work I have been aided by the\r\nco-operation of Mr. Bertsch, who, as is known, has discovered a means of\r\nfixing rapidly by photography any image from the microscope. I must state,\r\nin the first place, that even in 1837 Mr. Payen studied and published the\r\nstructure and the composition of a fragment of a grain of wheat; that\r\nthis learned chemist, whose authority in such matters is known, perfectly\r\ndescribed the envelopes or coverings, and indicated the presence of various\r\nimmediate principles (especially of azote, fatty and mineral substances\r\nwhich fill up the range of contiguous cells between them and the periphery\r\nof the perisperm, to the exclusion of the gluten and the starchy granules),\r\nas well as to the mode of insertion of the granules of starch in the gluten\r\ncontained in the cells, with narrow divisions from the perisperm, and in\r\nsuch a manner that up to the point of working indicated by the figure 1\r\nthis study was complete. However, I have been obliged to recommence it, to\r\nstudy the special facts bearing on the alimentary question, and I must say\r\nthat all the results obtained by Mr. Bertsch, Mr. Trécul, and myself agree\r\nwith those given by Mr. Payen.\r\n\r\n\r\nENVELOPES OF THE BERRY.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 represents a superficial side of the crease.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 indicates the epidermis or cuticle. This covering is extremely light,\r\nand offers nothing remarkable; 100 lb. of wheat contain ½ lb. of it.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 indicates the epicarp. This envelope is distinguished by a double\r\nrow of long and pointed vessels; it is, like the first one, very light and\r\nwithout action; 100 lb. of wheat contain 1 lb. of it.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 represents the endocarp, or last tegument of the berry; the\r\nsarcocarp, which should be found between the numbers 2 and 3, no longer\r\nexists, having been absorbed. The endocarp is remarkable by its row of\r\nround and regular cells, which appear in the cut like a continuous string\r\nof beads; 100 lb. of wheat contain 1½ lb. of it.\r\n\r\nThese three envelopes are colorless, light, and spongy; their elementary\r\ncomposition is that of straw; they are easily removed besides with the aid\r\nof damp and friction. This property has given rise to an operation called\r\ndecortication, the results of which we shall examine later on from an\r\nindustrial point of view. The whole of the envelopes of the berry of wheat\r\namount to 3 lb. in 100 lb. of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nENVELOPES AND TISSUES OF THE BERRY PROPER.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 indicates the testa or episperm. This external tegument of the berry\r\nis closer than the preceding ones; it contains in the very small cells\r\ntwo coloring matters, the one of a palish yellow, the other of an orange\r\nyellow, and according as the one or the other matter predominates, the\r\nwheat is of a more or less intense yellow color; hence come all the\r\nvarieties of wheat known in commerce as white, reddish, or red wheats.\r\nUnder this tegument is found a very thin, colorless membrane, which, with\r\nthe testa or episperm, forms two per cent. of the weight of the wheat.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 indicates the embryous membrane, which is only an expansion of the\r\ngerm or embryo No. 10. This membrane is seen purposely removed from its\r\ncontiguous parts, so as to render more visible its form and insertions.\r\nUnder this tissue is found with the Nos. 7, 8, and 9, the endosperm or\r\nperisperm, containing the gluten and the starch; soluble and insoluble\r\nalbuminoids, that is to say, the flour.\r\n\r\nThe endosperm and the embryous membrane are the most interesting parts of\r\nthe berry; the first is one of the depots of the plastic aliments, the\r\nsecond contains agents capable of dissolving these aliments during the\r\ngermination, of determining their absorption in the digestive organs of\r\nanimals, and of producing in the dough a decomposition strong enough to\r\nmake dark bread. We shall proceed to examine separately these two parts of\r\nthe berry.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOSPERM OR FLOURY PORTION, NOS. 7, 8, 9.\r\n\r\nThis portion is composed of large glutinous cells, in which the granules\r\nof starch are found. The composition of these different layers offers a\r\nparticular interest; the center, No. 9, is the softest part; it contains\r\nthe least gluten and the most starch; it is the part which first pulverizes\r\nunder the stone, and gives, after the first bolting, the fine flour. As\r\nthis flour is poorest in gluten, it makes a dough with little consistency,\r\nand incapable of making an open bread, well raised. The first layer, No.\r\n8, which surrounds the center, produces small white middlings, harder and\r\nricher in gluten than the center; it bakes very well, and weighs 20 lb. in\r\n100, and it is these 20 parts in 100 which, when mixed with the 50 parts in\r\nthe center, form the finest quality flour, used for making white bread.\r\n\r\nThe layer No. 7, which surrounds the preceding one, is still harder and\r\nricher in gluten; unfortunately in the reduction it becomes mixed with some\r\nhundredth parts of the bran, which render it unsuitable for making bread\r\nof the finest quality; it produces in the regrinding lower grade and\r\ndark flours, together weighing 7 per cent. The external layer, naturally\r\nadhering to the membrane, No. 6, becomes mixed in the grinding with bran,\r\nto the extent of about 20 per cent., which renders it unsuitable even\r\nfor making brown bread; it serves to form the regrindings and the offals\r\ndestined for the nourishment of animals; this layer is, however, the\r\nhardest, and contains the largest quantity of gluten, and it is by\r\nconsequence the most nutritive. We now see the endosperm increasing from\r\nthe center, formed of floury layers, which augment in richness in gluten,\r\nin proportion as they are removed from the center. Now, as the flours make\r\nmore bread in proportion to the quantity of gluten they contain, and the\r\ngluten gives more bread in proportion to its being more developed, or\r\nhaving more consistence, it follows that the flour belonging to the parts\r\nof the berry nearest the envelopes or coverings should produce the greatest\r\nportion of bread, and this is what takes place in effect. The product of\r\nthe different layers of the endosperm is given below, and it will be seen\r\nthat the quantity of bread increases in a proportion relatively greater\r\nthan that of the gluten, which proves once more that the gluten of the\r\ncenter or last formation has less consistence than that of the other layers\r\nof older formation.\r\n\r\nThe following are the results obtained from the same wheat:\r\n\r\n                                    Gluten.           Bread.\r\n100 parts of flour in center contain.. 8   and produce 128\r\n  \"             \"     first layer \" .. 9,2       \"     136\r\n  \"             \"     second    \" \" .. 11        \"     140\r\n  \"             \"     external  \" \" .. 13        \"     145\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is seen, according to the composition of the floury part\r\nof the grain, that the berry contains on an average 90 parts in 100 of\r\nflour fit for making bread of the first quality, and that the inevitable\r\nmixing in of a small quantity of bran reduces these 90 to 70 parts with\r\nthe ordinary processes; but the loss is not alone there, for the foregoing\r\ntable shows that the best portion of the grain is rejected from the food\r\nof man that brown or dark bread is made of flour of very good quality, and\r\nthat the first quality bread is made from the portion of the endosperm\r\ncontaining the gluten in the smallest quantity and in the least developed\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThis is a consideration not to be passed over lightly; assuredly the gluten\r\nof the center contains as much azote as the gluten of the circumference,\r\nbut it must not be admitted in a general way that the alimentary power of\r\na body is in connection with the amount of azote it contains, and without\r\nentering into considerations which would carry us too wide of the subject,\r\nwe shall simply state that if the flesh of young animals, as, for instance,\r\nthe calf, has a debilitating action, while the developed flesh of\r\nfull-grown animals--of a heifer, for example--has really nourishing\r\nproperties, although the flesh of each animal contains the same quantity of\r\nazote, we must conclude that the proportion of elements is not everything,\r\nand that the azotic or nitrogenous elements are more nourishing in\r\nproportion as they are more developed. This is why the gluten of the layers\r\nnearest the bran is of quite a special interest from the point of view of\r\nalimentation and in the preparation of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMBRYO AND THE COATING OF THE EMBRYO.\r\n\r\nTo be intelligible, I must commence by some very brief remarks on the\r\ntissues of vegetables. There are two sorts distinguished among plants;\r\nsome seem of no importance in the phenomena of nutrition; others, on the\r\ncontrary, tend to the assimilation of the organic or inorganic components\r\nwhich should nourish and develop all the parts of the plant. The latter\r\nhave a striking analogy with ferments; their composition is almost similar,\r\nand their action is increased or diminished by the same causes.\r\n\r\nThese tissues, formed in a state of repose in vegetables as in grain, have\r\nspecial properties; thus the berry possesses a pericarp whose tissues\r\nshould remain foreign to the phenomena of germination, and these tissues\r\nshow no particularity worthy of remark, but the coating of the embryo,\r\nwhich should play an active part, possesses, on the contrary, properties\r\nthat may be compared to those of ferments. With regard to these ferments,\r\nI must further remark that I have not been able, nor am I yet able, to\r\nexpress in formula my opinion of the nature of these bodies, but little\r\nknown as yet; I have only made use of the language mostly employed, without\r\nwishing to touch on questions raised by the effects of the presence, and\r\nby the more complex effects of living bodies, which exercise analogous\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nWith these reservations I shall proceed to examine the tissues in the berry\r\nwhich help toward the germination.\r\n\r\nTHE EMBRYO (10, see woodcut) is composed of the root of the plant, with\r\nwhich we have nothing to do here. This root of the plant which is to grow\r\nis embedded in a mass of cells full of fatty bodies. These bodies present\r\nthis remarkable particularity, that they contain among their elements\r\nsulphur and phosphorus. When you dehydrate by alcohol 100 grammes of the\r\nembryo of wheat, obtained by the same means as the membrane (a process\r\nindicated later on), this embryo, treated with ether, produces 20 grammes\r\nof oils composed elementarily of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, azote, sulphur,\r\nand phosphorus. This analysis, made according to the means indicated by M.\r\nFremy, shows that the fatty bodies of the embryo are composed like those of\r\nthe germ of an egg, like those of the brain and of the nervous system of\r\nanimals. It is necessary for us to stop an instant at this fact: in the\r\nfirst place, because it proves that vegetables are designed to form the\r\nphosphoric as well as the nitrogenous and ternary aliments, and finally,\r\nbecause it indicates how important it is to mix the embryo and its\r\ndependents with the bread in the most complete manner possible, seeing that\r\na large portion of these phosphoric bodies always become decomposed during\r\nthe baking.\r\n\r\nCOATING OF THE EMBRYO.--This membrane (6), which is only an expansion of\r\nthe embryo, surrounds the endosperm; it is composed of beautiful irregular\r\ncubic cells, diminishing according as they come nearer to the embryo. These\r\ncells are composed, first, of the insoluble cellular tissue; second,\r\nof phosphate of chalk and fatty phosphoric bodies; third, of soluble\r\ncerealine. In order to study the composition and the nature of this\r\ntissue, it must be completely isolated, and this result is obtained in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nThe wheat should be damped with water containing 10 parts in 100 of\r\nalcoholized caustic soda; at the expiration of one hour the envelopes of\r\nthe pericarp, and of the testa Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, should be separated by\r\nfriction in a coarse cloth, having been reduced by the action of the alkali\r\nto a pulpy state; each berry should then be opened separately to remove the\r\nportion of the envelope held in the fold of the crease, and then all the\r\nberries divided in two are put into three parts of water charged with\r\none-hundredth of caustic potash. This liquid dissolves the gluten, divides\r\nthe starch, and at the expiration of twenty-four hours the parts of the\r\nberries are kneaded between the fingers, collected in pure water, and\r\nwashed until the water issues clear; these membranes with their embryos,\r\nwhich are often detached by this operation, are cast into water acidulated\r\nwith one-hundredth of hydrochloric acid, and at the end of several hours\r\nthey should be completely washed. The product obtained consists of\r\nbeautiful white membranes, insoluble in alkalies and diluted acids, which\r\nshow under the microscope beautiful cells joined in a tissue following the\r\nembryo, with which it has indeed a striking analogy in its properties and\r\ncomposition. This membrane, exhausted by the alcohol and ether, gives, by\r\nan elementary analysis, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and azote. Unfortunately,\r\nunder the action of the tests this membrane has been killed, and it no\r\nlonger possesses the special properties of active tissues. Among these\r\nproperties three may be especially mentioned:\r\n\r\n1st. Its resistance to water charged with a mineral salt, such as sea salt\r\nfor instance\r\n\r\n2d. Its action through its presence.\r\n\r\n3d. Its action as a ferment.\r\n\r\nThe action of saltwater is explained as follows: When the berry is plunged\r\ninto pure water it will be observed that the water penetrates in the course\r\nof a few hours to the very center of the endosperm, but if water charged\r\nor saturated with sea salt be used, it will be seen that the liquid\r\nimmediately passes through the teguments Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, and stops\r\nabruptly before the embryo membrane No. 6, which will remain quite dry and\r\nbrittle for several days, the berry remaining all the time in the\r\nwater. Should the water penetrate further after several days, it can be\r\nascertained that the entrance was gained through the part No 10 free of\r\nthis tissue, and this notwithstanding the cells are full of fatty bodies.\r\nThis membrane alone produces this action, for if the coatings Nos. 2, 3, 4,\r\nand 5 be removed, the resistance to the liquid remains the same, while if\r\nthe whole, or a portion of it, be divided, either by friction between two\r\nmillstones or by simple incisions, the liquid penetrates the berry within\r\na few hours. This property is analogous to that of the radicules of roots,\r\nwhich take up the bodies most suitable for the nourishment of the plant. It\r\nproves, besides, that this membrane, like all those endowed with life, does\r\nnot obey more the ordinary laws of permeability than those of chemical\r\naffinity, and this property can be turned to advantage in the preservation\r\nof grain in decortication and grinding.\r\n\r\nTo determine the action of this tissue through its presence, take 100\r\ngrammes of wheat, wash it and remove the first coating by decortication;\r\nthen immerse it for several hours in lukewarm water, and dry afterwards in\r\nan ordinary temperature. It should then be reduced in a small coffee mill,\r\nthe flour and middlings separated by sifting and the bran repassed through\r\na machine that will crush it without breaking it; then dress it again, and\r\nrepeat the operation six times at least. The bran now obtained is composed\r\nof the embryous membrane, a little flour adhering to it, and some traces\r\nof the teguments Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5. This coarse tissue-weighs about 14\r\ngrammes, and to determine its action through its presence, place it in 200\r\ngrammes of water at a temperature of 86°; afterwards press it. The liquid\r\nthat escapes contains chiefly the flour and cerealine. Filter this liquid,\r\nand put it in a test glass marked No. 1, which will serve to determine the\r\naction of the cerealine.\r\n\r\nThe bran should now be washed until the water issues pure, and until it\r\nshows no bluish color when iodized water and sulphuric acid are added; when\r\nthe washing is finished the bran swollen by the water is placed under a\r\npress, and the liquid extracted is placed, after being filtered, in a test\r\ntube. This test tube serves to show that all cerealine has been removed\r\nfrom the blades of the tissue. Finally, these small blades of bran, washed\r\nand pressed, are cast, with 50 grammes of lukewarm water, into a test tube,\r\nmarked No. 3; 100 grammes of diluted starch to one-tenth of dry starch\r\nare then added in each test tube, and they are put into a water bath at\r\na temperature of 104° Fahrenheit, being stirred lightly every fifteen\r\nminutes. At the expiration of an hour, or at the most an hour and a half,\r\nNo. 1 glass no longer contains any starch, as it has been converted into\r\ndextrine and glucose by the cerealine, and the iodized water only produces\r\na purple color. No. 2 glass, with the same addition, produces a bluish\r\ncolor, and preserves the starch intact, which proves that the bran was well\r\nfreed from the cerealine contained. No. 3 glass, like No. 1, shows a purple\r\ncoloring, and the liquid only contains, in place of the starch, dextrine\r\nand glucose, _i. e_, the tissue has had the same action as the cerealine\r\ndeprived of the tissue, and the cerealine as the tissue freed from\r\ncerealine. The same membrane rewashed can again transform the diluted\r\nstarch several times. This action is due to the presence of the embryous\r\nmembrane, for after four consecutive operations it still preserves its\r\noriginal weight. As regards the remains of the other segments, they have\r\nno influence on this phenomenon, for the coating Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5,\r\nseparated by the water and friction, have no action whatever on the diluted\r\nstarch. Besides its action through its presence, which is immediate,\r\nthe embryous membrane may also act as a ferment, active only after a\r\ndevelopment, varying in duration according to the conditions of temperature\r\nand the presence or absence of ferments in acting.\r\n\r\nI make a distinction here as is seen, between the action through being\r\npresent, and the action of real ferments, but it is not my intention to\r\napprove or disapprove of the different opinions expressed on this subject.\r\nI make use of these expressions only to explain more clearly the phenomena\r\nI have to speak of, for it is our duty to bear in mind that the real\r\nferments only act after a longer or shorter period of development, while,\r\non the other hand, the effects through presence are immediate.\r\n\r\nI now return to the embryous membrane. Various causes increase or decrease\r\nthe action of this tissue, but it may be said in general that all the\r\nagents that kill the embryous membrane will also kill the cerealine. This\r\nwas the reason why I at first attributed the production of dark bread\r\nexclusively to the latter ferment, but it was easy to observe that during\r\nthe baking, decompositions resulted at over 158° Fah., while the cerealine\r\nwas still coagulated, and that bread containing bran, submitted to 212° of\r\nheat, became liquefied in water at 104°. It was now easy to determine\r\nthat dark flours, from which the cerealine had been removed by repeated\r\nwashings, still produced dark bread. It was at this time, in remembering\r\nmy experiences with organic bodies, I determined the properties of the\r\ninsoluble tissue, deprived of the soluble cerealine, with analogous\r\nproperties, but distinguished not alone by its solid organization and state\r\nof insolubility, but also by its resistance to heat, which acts as on\r\nyeast. There exists, in reality, I repeat, a resemblance between the\r\nembryous membrane and the yeast; they have the same immediate composition;\r\nthey are destroyed by the same poisons, deadened by the same temperatures,\r\nannihilated by the same agents, propagated in an analogous manner, and\r\nit might be said that the organic tissues endowed with life are only an\r\nagglomeration of fixed cells of ferments. At all events, when the blades of\r\nthe embryous membrane, prepared as already stated, are exposed to a water\r\nbath at 212°, this tissue, in contact with the diluted starch, produces\r\nthe same decomposition; the contact, however, should continue two or three\r\nhours in place of one. If, instead of placing these membranes in the water\r\nbath, they are enveloped in two pounds of dough, and this dough put in the\r\noven, after the baking the washed membranes produce the same results, which\r\nespecially proves that this membrane can support a temperature of 212° Fah.\r\nwithout disorganization. We shall refer to this property in speaking of the\r\nphenomena of panification.\r\n\r\nCEREALINE.--The cells composing the embryous membrane contain, as already\r\nstated, the cerealine, but after the germination they contain cerealine and\r\ndiastase, that is to say, a portion of the cerealine changed into diastase,\r\nwith which it has the greatest analogy. It is known how difficult it is to\r\nisolate and study albuminous substances. The following is the method of\r\nobtaining and studying cerealine. Take the raw embryous membrane, prepared\r\nas stated, steep it for an hour in spirits of wine diluted with twice its\r\nvolume of water, and renew this liquid several times until the dextrine,\r\nglucose, coloring matters, etc., have been completely removed. The\r\nmembranes should now be pressed and cast into a quantity of water\r\nsufficient to make a fluid paste of them, squeeze out the mixture,\r\nfilter the liquid obtained, and this liquid will contain the cerealine\r\nsufficiently pure to be studied in its effects. Its principal properties\r\nare: The liquid evaporated at a low temperature produces an amorphous,\r\nrough mass nearly colorless, and almost entirely soluble in distilled\r\nwater; this solution coagulates between 158° and 167° Fah., and the\r\ncoagulum is insoluble in acids and weak alkalies; the solution is\r\nprecipitated by all diluted acids, by phosphoric acid at all the degrees of\r\nhydration, and even by a current of carbonic acid. All these precipitates\r\nredissolve with an excess of acid, sulphuric acid excepted. Concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid forms an insoluble downy white precipitate, and the\r\nconcentrated vegetable acids, with the exception of tannic acid, do not\r\ndetermine any precipitate. Cerealine coagulated by an acid redissolves in\r\nan excess of the same acid, but it has become dead and has no more action\r\non the starch. The alkalies do not form any precipitate, but they kill the\r\ncerealine as if it had been precipitated The neutral rennet does not make\r\nany precipitate in a solution of cerealine--5 centigrammes of dry cerealine\r\ntransform in twenty-five minutes 10 grammes of starch, reduced to a paste\r\nby 100 grammes of water at 113° Fah. It will be seen that cerealine has a\r\ngrand analogy with albumen and legumine, but it is distinguished from them\r\nby the action of the rennet, of the heat of acids, alcohol, and above all\r\nby its property of transforming the starch into glucose and dextrine.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that some albuminous substances have this property, but it\r\nmust be borne in mind that these bodies, like gluten, for example, only\r\npossess it after the commencement of the decomposition. The albuminous\r\nmatter approaching nearest to cerealine is the diastase, for it is only a\r\ntransformation of the cerealine during the germination, the proof of which\r\nmay be had in analyzing the embryous membrane, which shows more diastase\r\nand less cerealine in proportion to the advancement of the germination: it\r\ndiffers, however, from the diastase by the action of heat, alcohol, etc.\r\nIt is seen that in every case the cerealine and the embryous membrane\r\nact together, and in an analogous manner; we shall shortly examine their\r\neffects on the digestion and in the phenomena of panification.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHATE OF CALCIUM.--Mr. Payen was the first to make the observation\r\nthat the greatest amount of phosphate of chalk is found in the teguments\r\nadjoining the farinaceous or floury mass. This observation is important\r\nfrom two points of view; in the first place, it shows us that this mineral\r\naliment, necessary to the life of animals, is rejected from ordinary bread;\r\nand in the next place, it brings a new proof that phosphate of chalk is\r\nfound, and ought to be found, in everyplace where there are membranes\r\nsusceptible of exercising vital functions among animals as well as\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nPhosphate of chalk is not in reality (as I wished to prove in another work)\r\na plastic matter suitable for forming bones, for the bones of infants are\r\nthree times more solid than those of old men, which contain three times\r\nas much of it. The quantity of phosphate of chalk necessary to the\r\nconstitution of animals is in proportion to the temperature of those\r\nanimals, and often in the inverse ratio of the weight of their bones, for\r\nvegetables, although they have no bones, require phosphate of chalk. This\r\nis because this salt is the natural stimulant of living membranes, and the\r\nbony tissue is only a depot of phosphate of chalk, analogous to the adipose\r\ntissue, the fat of which is absorbed when the alimentation coming from the\r\nexterior becomes insufficient. Now, as we know all the parts constituting\r\nthe berry of wheat, it will be easy to explain the phenomena of\r\npanification, and to conclude from the present moment that it is not\r\nindifferent to reject from the bread this embryous membrane where the\r\nagents of digestion are found, viz., the phosphoric bodies and the\r\nphosphate of chalk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF NEW PROCESS MILLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following article was written by Albert Hoppin, editor of the\r\n_Northwestern Miller_, at the request of Special Agent Chas. W. Johnson,\r\nand forms a part of his report to the census bureau on the manufacturing\r\nindustries of Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n\"The development of the milling industry in this city has been so\r\nintimately connected with the growth and prosperity of the city itself,\r\nthat the steps by which the art of milling has reached its present high\r\nstate of perfection are worthy of note, especially as Minneapolis may\r\nrightly claim the honor of having brought the improvements, which have\r\nwithin the last decade so thoroughly revolutionized the art of making\r\nflour, first into public notice, and of having contributed the largest\r\nshare of capital and inventive skill to their full development. So much is\r\nthis the case that the cluster of mills around the Falls of St. Anthony is\r\nto-day looked upon as the head-center of the milling industry not only of\r\nthis country, but of the world. An exception to this broad statement may\r\npossibly be made in favor of the city of Buda Pest, in Austro-Hungary, from\r\nthe leading mills in which the millers in this country have obtained many\r\nvaluable ideas. To the credit of American millers and millwrights it must,\r\nhowever, be said that they have in all cases improved upon the information\r\nthey have thus obtained.\r\n\r\n\"To rightly understand the change that has taken place in milling methods\r\nduring the last ten years, it is necessary to compare the old way with the\r\nnew, and to observe wherein they differ. From the days of Oliver Evans, the\r\nfirst American mechanic to make any improvement in milling machinery, until\r\n1870, there was, if we may except some grain cleaning or smut machines,\r\nno very strongly marked advance in milling machinery or in the methods of\r\nmanufacturing flour. It is true that the reel covered with finely-woven\r\nsilk bolting cloth had taken the place of the muslin or woolen covered hand\r\nsieve, and that the old granite millstones have given place to the French\r\nburr; but these did not affect the essential parts of the _modus operandi_,\r\nalthough the quality of the product was, no doubt, materially improved. The\r\nprocesses employed in all the mills in the United States ten years ago were\r\nidentical, or very nearly so, with those in use in the Brandywine Mills in\r\nEvans's day. They were very simple, and may be divided into two distinct\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\"First. Grinding (literally) the wheat.\r\n\r\n\"Second. Bolting or separating the flour or interior portion of the berry\r\nfrom the outer husk, or bran. It may seem to some a rash assertion, but\r\nthis primitive way of making flour is still in vogue in over one-half of\r\nthe mills of the United States. This does not, however, affect the truth of\r\nthe statement that the greater part of the flour now made in this country\r\nis made on an entirely different and vastly-improved system, which has come\r\nto be known to the trade as the new process.\r\n\r\n\"In looking for a reason for the sudden activity and spirit of progress\r\nwhich had its culmination in the new process, the character of the\r\nwheat raised in the different sections of the Union must be taken into\r\nconsideration. Wheat may be divided into two classes, spring and winter,\r\nthe latter generally being more starchy and easily pulverized, and at the\r\nsame time having a very tough bran or husk, which does not readily crumble\r\nor cut to pieces in the process of grinding. It was with this wheat that\r\nthe mills of the country had chiefly to do, and the defects of the old\r\nsystem of milling were not then so apparent. With the settlement of\r\nMinnesota, and the development of its capacities as a wheat-growing State,\r\na new factor in the milling problem was introduced, which for a time bid\r\nfair to ruin every miller who undertook to solve it. The wheat raised in\r\nthis State was, from the climatic conditions, a spring wheat, hard in\r\nstructure and having a thin, tender, and friable bran. In milling this\r\nwheat, if an attempt was made to grind it as fine as was then customary to\r\ngrind winter wheat, the bran was ground almost as fine as the flour, and\r\npassed as readily through the meshes of the bolting reels or sieves,\r\nrendering the flour dark, specky, and altogether unfit to enter the Eastern\r\nmarkets in competition with flour from the winter wheat sections. On the\r\nother hand, if the grinding was not so fine as to break up the bran,\r\nthe interior of the berry being harder to pulverize, was not rendered\r\nsufficiently fine, and there remained after the flour was bolted out a\r\nlarge percentage of shorts or middlings, which, while containing the\r\nstrongest and best flour in the berry, were so full of dirt and impurities\r\nas to render them unfit for any further grinding except for the very lowest\r\ngrade of flour, technically known as 'red dog.' The flour produced from\r\nthe first grinding was also more or less specky and discolored, and, in\r\neverything but strength, inferior to that made from winter wheat, while the\r\n'yield' was so small, or, in other words, the amount of wheat which it took\r\nto make a barrel of flour was so large, that milling in Minnesota and other\r\nspring wheat sections was anything but profitable.\r\n\r\n\"The problem which ten years since confronted the millers of this city was\r\nhow to obtain from the wheat which they had to grind a white, clear flour,\r\nand to so increase the yield as to leave some margin for profit. The first\r\nstep in the solution of this problem was the invention by E. N. La Croix\r\nof the machine which has since been called the purifier, which removed the\r\ndirt and light impurities from the refuse middlings in the same manner that\r\ndust and chaff are removed from wheat by a fanning mill. The middlings thus\r\npurified were then reground, and the result was a much whiter and cleaner\r\nflour than it had been possible to obtain under the old process of low\r\nclose grinding. This flour was called 'patent' or 'fancy,' and at once took\r\na high position in the market. The first machine built by La Croix was\r\nimmediately improved by George T. Smith, and has since then been the\r\nsubject of numberless variations, changes, and improvements; and over the\r\nprinciples embodied in its construction there has been fought one of the\r\nlongest and most bitter battles recorded in the annals of patent litigation\r\nin this country. The purifier is to-day the most important machine in use\r\nin the manufacture of flour in this country, and may with propriety be\r\ncalled the corner-stone of new process milling. The earliest experiments in\r\nits use in this country were made in what was then known as the 'big mill'\r\nin this city, owned by Washburn, Stephens & Co., and now known as the\r\nWashburn Mill B.\r\n\r\n\"The next step in the development of the new process, also originating\r\nin Minneapolis, was the abandonment of the old system of cracking the\r\nmillstone, and substituting in its stead the use of smooth surfaces on the\r\nmillstones, thus in a large measure doing away with the abrasion of the\r\nbran, and raising the quality of the flour produced at the first grinding.\r\nSo far as we know, Mr. E. R. Stephens, a Minneapolis miller, then employed\r\nin the mill owned by Messrs. Pillsbury, Crocker & Fish, and now a member of\r\nthe prominent milling firm of Freeman & Stephens, River Falls, Wisconsin,\r\nwas the first to venture on this innovation. He also first practiced the\r\nwidening of the furrows in the millstones and increasing their number, thus\r\nadding largely to the amount of middlings made at the first grinding, and\r\nraising the percentage of patent flour. He was warmly supported by Amasa K.\r\nOstrander, since deceased, the founder and for a number of years the editor\r\nof the _North-Western Miller_, a trade newspaper. The new ideas were for a\r\ntime vigorously combated by the millers, but their worth was so plain that\r\nthey were soon adopted, not only in Minneapolis, but by progressive millers\r\nthroughout the country. The truth was the 'new process' in its entirety,\r\nwhich may be summarized in four steps--first, grinding or, more properly,\r\ngranulating the berry; second, bolting or separating the 'chop' or meal\r\ninto first flour, middlings, and bran; third, purifying the middlings,\r\nfourth, regrinding and rebolting the middlings to produce the higher grade,\r\nor 'patent' flour. This higher grade flour drove the best winter wheat\r\nflours out of the Eastern markets, and placed milling in Minnesota upon a\r\nfirm basis. The development of the 'new process' cannot be claimed by any\r\none man. Hundreds of millers all over the country have contributed to its\r\nadvance, but the millers of Minneapolis have always taken the lead.\r\n\r\n\"Within the past two or three years what may be distinctively called the\r\n'new process' has, in the mills of Minneapolis and some few other leading\r\nmills in the country, been giving place to a new system, or rather, a\r\nrefinement of the processes above described. This latest system is known to\r\nthe trade as the 'gradual reduction' or high-grinding system, as the 'new\r\nprocess' is the medium high-grinding system, and the old way is the low or\r\nclose grinding system. In using the gradual reduction in making flour the\r\nmillstones are abandoned, except for finishing some of the inferior grades\r\nof flour, and the work is done by means of grooved and plain rollers, made\r\nof chilled iron or porcelain. In some cases disks of chilled iron, suitably\r\nfurrowed, are used, and in others concave mills, consisting of a cylinder\r\nrunning against a concave plate. In Minneapolis the chilled iron rolls take\r\nthe precedence of all other means.\r\n\r\n\"The system of gradual reduction is much more complicated than either of\r\nthose which preceded it; but the results obtained are a marked advance over\r\nthe 'new process.' The percentage of high-grade flour is increased, several\r\ngrades of different degrees of excellence being produced, and the yield\r\nis also greater from a given quantity of wheat. The system consists in\r\nreducing the wheat to flour, not at one operation, as in the old system,\r\nnor in two grindings, as in the 'new process,' but in several successive\r\nreductions, four, five, or six, as the case may be. The wheat is first\r\npassed through a pair of corrugated chilled iron rollers, which merely\r\nsplit it open along the crease of the berry, liberating the dirt which lies\r\nin the crease so that it can be removed by bolting. A very small percentage\r\nof low-grade flour is also made in this reduction. After passing through\r\nwhat is technically called a 'scalping reel' to remove the dirt and flour,\r\nthe broken wheat is passed through a second set of corrugated rollers, by\r\nwhich it is further broken up, and then passes through a second separating\r\nreel, which removes the flour and middlings. This operation is repeated\r\nsuccessively until the flour portion of the berry is entirely removed from\r\nthe bran, the necessary separation being made after each reduction. The\r\nmiddlings from the several reductions are passed through the purifiers,\r\nand, after being purified, are reduced to flour by successive reductions\r\non smooth iron or porcelain rollers. In some cases, as stated above, iron\r\ndisks and concave mills are substituted for the roller mill, but the\r\noperation is substantially the same. One of the principal objects sought to\r\nbe attained by this high-grinding system is to avoid all abrasion of the\r\nbran, another is to take out the dirt in the crease of the berry at the\r\nbeginning of the process, and still another to thoroughly free the bran\r\nfrom flour, so as to obtain as large a yield as possible. Incidental to the\r\nimproved methods of milling, as now practiced in this country, is a marked\r\nimprovement in the cleaning of the grain and preparing it for flouring. The\r\nearliest grain-cleaning machine was the 'smutter,' the office of which was\r\nto break the smut balls, and scour the outside of the bran to remove any\r\nadhering dust, the scouring machine being too harsh in its action, breaking\r\nthe kernels of wheat, and so scratching and weakening the bran that it\r\nbroke up readily in the grinding. The scouring process was therefore\r\nlessened, and was followed by brush machines, which brushed the dirt,\r\nloosened up and left by the scourer, from the berry. Other machines for\r\nremoving the fuzzy and germ ends of the berry have also been introduced,\r\nand everything possible is done to free the grain from extraneous\r\nimpurities before the process of reduction is commenced. In all the minor\r\ndetails of the mill there has been the same marked change, until the modern\r\nmerchant mill of to-day no more resembles that of twenty-five years ago\r\nthan does the modern cotton mill the old-fashioned distaff. The change has\r\nextended into the winter wheat sections, and no mill in the United States\r\ncan hope to hold its place in the markets unless it is provided with the\r\nmany improvements in machinery and processes which have resulted from the\r\nexperiments begun in this city only ten years since, and which have\r\nmade the name of Minneapolis and the products of her many mills famous\r\nthroughout the world. The relative merits of the flour made by the new\r\nprocess and the old have been warmly discussed, but the general verdict\r\nof the great body of consumers is that the patent or new process flour is\r\nbetter in every way for bread making purposes, being clearer, whiter, more\r\nevenly granulated, and possessing more strength. Careful chemical analysis\r\nhas confirmed this. As between winter and spring wheat flours made by the\r\nnew process and gradual reduction systems, it maybe remarked that the\r\nformer contain more starch and are whiter in color, while the latter,\r\nhaving more gluten, excel in strength. In milling all varieties of wheat,\r\nwhether winter or spring, the new processes are in every way superior to\r\nthe old, and, in aiding their inception and development, the millers of\r\nMinneapolis have conferred a lasting benefit on the country.\r\n\r\n\"Minneapolis, Minn., December 1, 1880.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILLING STRUCTURES AND MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson added the following, showing the present status of the milling\r\nindustry in Minneapolis:\r\n\r\n\"The description of the process of the manufacture of flour so well\r\ngiven above, conveys no idea of the extent and magnitude of the milling\r\nstructures, machinery, and buildings employed in the business. Many of the\r\nleading millers and millwrights have personally visited and studied the\r\nbest mills in England, France, Hungary, and Germany, and are as familiar\r\nwith their theory, methods, and construction as of their own, and no\r\nexpense or labor has been spared in introducing the most approved features\r\nof the improvements in the foreign mills. Experimenting is constantly going\r\non, and the path behind the successful millers is strewn with the wrecks of\r\nfailures. A very large proportion of the machinery is imported, though the\r\nAmerican machinists are fast outstripping their European rivals in the\r\nquality and efficiency of the machinery needed for the new mills constantly\r\ngoing up.\r\n\r\n\"There are twenty-eight of these mills now constructed and at work,\r\noperating an equivalent of 412 runs of stone, consuming over sixteen\r\nmillion bushels of wheat, and manufacturing over three million barrels of\r\nflour annually. Their capacities range from 250 to 1,500 barrels of flour\r\nper day. Great as these capacities are, there is now one in process of\r\nconstruction, the Pillsbury A Mill, which at the beginning of the harvest\r\nof 1881 will have a capacity of 4,000 barrels daily. The Washburn A Mill,\r\nwhose capacity is now 1,500 barrels, is being enlarged to make 8,500\r\nbarrels a day, and the Crown Roller Mill, owned by Christian Bros. & Co.,\r\nis also being enlarged to produce 3,000 barrels a day. The largest mill in\r\nEurope has a daily capacity of but 2,800 barrels, and no European mill is\r\nfitted with the exquisite perfection of machinery and apparatus to be found\r\nin the mills of this city.\r\n\r\n\"The buildings are mainly built of blue limestone, found so abundant in the\r\nquarries of this city, range and line work, and rest on the solid ledge.\r\nThe earlier built mills are severely plain, but the newer ones are greatly\r\nimproved by the taste of the architect, and are imposing and beautiful in\r\nappearance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT FOREIGN TRADE.\r\n\r\nThe flour of Minneapolis, holding so high a rank in the markets of the\r\nworld, is always in active demand, especially the best grades, and brings\r\nfrom $1.00 to $1.60 per barrel more than flour of the best qualities of\r\nsouthern, eastern, or foreign wheat. During the year nearly a million\r\nbarrels were shipped direct to European and other foreign ports, on through\r\nbills of lading, and drawn for by banks here having special foreign\r\nexchange arrangements, at sight, on the day of shipment. This trade\r\nis constantly increasing, and the amount of flour handled by eastern\r\ncommission men is decreasing in proportion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReferring to the foregoing, the following letter from Mr. Geo. T. Smith to\r\nthe editor of the _London Miller_ is of interest:\r\n\r\nSIR: I find published in the _North-western Miller_ of December 24, 1880,\r\nextracts from an article on the origin of new process milling, prepared by\r\nAlbert Hoppin, Esq., editor of the above-named journal, for the use of one\r\nof the statistical divisions of the United States census, which is so at\r\nvariance, in at least one important particular, with the facts set forth in\r\nthe paper read by me before the British and Irish millers, at their meeting\r\nin May last, that I think I ought to take notice of its statements, more\r\nespecially as the _North-Western Miller_ has quite a circulation on this\r\nside of the water.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the paper read by me above-mentioned, I was engaged in\r\nFebruary, 1871, by Mr. Christian, who was then operating the \"big,\" or\r\nWashburn Mill at Minneapolis, to take charge of the stones in that mill. At\r\nthis time Mr. Christian was very much interested in the improvement of the\r\nquality of his flour, which in common with the flour of Minneapolis mills,\r\nwithout exception, was very poor indeed. For some time previous to this I\r\nhad insisted to him most strenuously that the beginning of any improvement\r\nmust be found in smooth, true, and well balanced stones, and it was because\r\nhe was at last convinced that my ideas were at least worthy of a practical\r\ntest I was placed in charge of his mill. Nearly two months were consumed in\r\ntruing and smoothing the stone, as all millers in the mill had struck\r\nat once when they became acquainted with the character of the changes I\r\nproposed to make.\r\n\r\nI remained with Mr. Christian until the latter part of 1871, in all about\r\neight months. During this time the flour from the Washburn Mill attained a\r\ncelebrity that made it known and sought after all over the United States.\r\nIt commanded attention as an event of the very greatest importance, from\r\nthe fact that it was justly felt that if a mill grinding spring wheat\r\nexclusively was capable of producing a flour infinitely superior in every\r\nway to the best that could be made from the finest varieties of winter\r\nwheats, the new North Western territory, with its peculiar adaptation to\r\nthe growing of spring grain, and its boundless capacity for production,\r\nmust at once become one of the most important sections of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Christian's appreciation of the improvements I had made in his mill\r\nwas attested by doubly-locked and guarded entrances, and by the stringent\r\nregulations which were adopted to prevent any of his employes carrying\r\ninformation with regard to the process to his competitors.\r\n\r\nAll this time other Minneapolis mills were doing such work and only such as\r\nthey had done previously. Ought not the writer of an article on the origin\r\nof new process milling--which article is intended to become historical, and\r\nto have its authenticity indorsed by the government--to have known whether\r\nMr. Christian, in the Washburn Mill, did or did not make a grade of\r\nflour which has hardly been excelled since for months before any other\r\nMinneapolis mill approached his product in any degree? And should he not\r\nbe well enough acquainted with the milling of that period--1871-2--to know\r\nthat such results as were obtained in the Washburn Mill could only be\r\nsecured by the use of _smooth_ and _true_ stones? Mr. Stephens--whom I\r\nshall mention again presently--did _not_ work in the Washburn Mill while I\r\nwas in charge of it.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1871 I entered into a contract with Mr. C. A. Pillsbury,\r\nowner of the Taylor Mill and senior partner in the firm by whom the\r\nMinneapolis Mill was operated, to put both those mills into condition to\r\nmake the same grade of flour as Mr. Christian was making. The consideration\r\nin the contract was 5,000 dols. At the above mills I met to some extent the\r\nsame obstruction in regard to millers striking as had greeted me at Mr.\r\nChristian's mill earlier in the year; but among those who did not strike at\r\nthe Minneapolis Mill I saw, for the first time, Mr. Stephens--then still\r\nin his apprenticeship--whom Mr. Hoppin declares to have been, \"so far as I\r\nknow,\" the first miller to use smooth stones. If Mr. Hoppin is right in his\r\nassertion, perhaps he will explain why, during the eight months I was at\r\nthe Washburn Mill, Mr. Stephens did not make a corresponding improvement\r\nin the product of the Minneapolis Mill. That he did not do this is amply\r\nproved by the fact of Mr. Pillsbury giving me 5,000 dols. to introduce\r\nimprovements into his mills, when, supposing Mr. Hoppin's statement to\r\nbe correct, he might have had the same alterations carried out under Mr.\r\nStephens' direction at a mere nominal cost. As a matter of fact, the stones\r\nin both the Taylor and Minneapolis Mills were as rough as any in the\r\nWashburn Mill when I took charge of them.\r\n\r\nThus it appears (1) that the flour made by the mill in which Stephens was\r\nemployed was not improved in quality, while that of the Washburn Mill,\r\nwhere he was not employed, became the finest that had ever been made in the\r\nUnited States at that time. That (2) the owner of the mill in which Mr.\r\nStephens was employed, as he was not making good flour, engaged me at a\r\nlarge cost to introduce into his mills the alterations by which only, both\r\nMr. Hoppin and myself agree, could any material improvement in the milling\r\nof that period be effected, .viz., smooth, true, and well-balanced\r\nstones.--GEO. T. SMITH.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor breachy animals do not use barbed fences. To see the lacerations that\r\nthese fences have produced upon the innocent animals should be sufficient\r\ntestimony against them. Many use pokes and blinders on cattle and goats,\r\nbut as a rule such things fail. The better way is to separate breachy\r\nanimals from the lot, as others will imitate their habits sooner or later,\r\nand then, if not curable, _sell them_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUENON MILK-MIRROR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of the simple Bordeaux peasant is, and should be, permanently\r\nassociated with his discovery that the milking qualities of cows were, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, indicated by certain external marks easily observed.\r\nWe had long known that capacious udders and large milk veins, combined with\r\ngood digestive capacity and a general preponderance of the alimentary over\r\nthe locomotive system, were indications that rarely misled in regard to the\r\nability of a cow to give much milk; but to judge of the amount of milk a\r\ncow would yield, and the length of time she would hold out in her flow, two\r\nor three years before she could be called a cow--this was Guenon's great\r\naccomplishment, and the one for which he was awarded a gold medal by the\r\nAgricultural Society of his native district. This was the first of many\r\nhonors with which he was rewarded, and it is much to say that no committee\r\nof agriculturists who have ever investigated the merits of the system\r\nhave ever spoken disparagingly of it. Those who most closely study it,\r\nespecially following Guenon's original system, which has never been\r\nessentially improved upon, are most positive in regard to its truth,\r\nenthusiastic in regard to its value.\r\n\r\nThe fine, soft hair upon the hinder part of a cow's udder for the most part\r\nturns upward. This upward-growing hair extends in most cases all over that\r\npart of the udder visible between the hind legs, but is occasionally marked\r\nby spots or mere lines, usually slender ovals, in which the hair grows\r\ndown. This tendency of the hair to grow upward is not confined to the udder\r\nproper; but extends out upon the thighs and upward to the tail. The edges\r\nof this space over which the hair turns up are usually distinctly marked,\r\nand, as a rule, the larger the area of this space, which is called the\r\n\"mirror\" or \"escutcheon,\" the more milk the cow will give, and the longer\r\nshe will continue in milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESCUTCHEON OF THE JERSEY BULL-CALF, GRAND MIRROR, 4,904.]\r\n\r\nThat portion of the escutcheon which covers the udder and extends out on\r\nthe inside of each thigh, has been designated as the udder or mammary\r\nmirror; that which runs upward towards the setting on of the tail, the\r\nrising or placental mirror. The mammary mirror is of the greater value,\r\nyet the rising mirror is not to be disregarded. It is regarded of especial\r\nmoment that the mirror, taken as a whole, be symmetrical, and especially\r\nthat the mammary mirror be so; yet it often occurs that it is far\r\notherwise, its outline being often very fantastical--exhibiting deep\r\n_bays_, so to speak, and islands of downward growing hair. There are also\r\ncertain \"ovals,\" never very large, yet distinct, which do not detract from\r\nthe estimated value of an escutcheon; notably those occurring on the lobes\r\nof the udder just above the hind teats. These are supposed to be points of\r\nvalue, though for what reason it would be hard to tell, yet they do occur\r\nupon some of the very best milch cows, and those whose mirrors correspond\r\nmost closely to their performances.\r\n\r\nMr. Guenon's discovery enables breeders to determine which of their calves\r\nare most promising, and in purchasing young stock it affords indications\r\nwhich rarely fail as to their comparative milk yield. These indications\r\noccasionally prove utterly fallacious, and Mr. Guenon gives rules for\r\ndetermining this class, which he calls \"bastards,\" without waiting for them\r\nto fail in their milk. The signs are, however, rarely so distinct that one\r\nwould be willing to sell a twenty-quart cow, whose yield confirmed the\r\nprediction of her mirror at first calving, because of the possibility of\r\nthe going dry in two months, or so, as indicated by her bastardy marks.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the mirrors of bulls (which are much like\r\nthose of cows, but less extensive in every direction) are reflected in\r\ntheir daughters. This gives rise to the dangerous custom of breeding for\r\nmirrors, rather than for milk. What the results may be after a few years it\r\nis easy to see. The mirror, being valued for its own sake--that is, because\r\nit sells the heifers--will be likely to lose its practical significance and\r\nvalue as a _milk_ mirror.\r\n\r\nWe have a striking photograph of a young Jersey bull, the property of Mr.\r\nJohn L. Hopkins, of Atlanta, Ga., and called \"Grand Mirror.\" This we have\r\ncaused to be engraved and the mirror is clearly shown. A larger mirror is\r\nrarely seen upon a bull. We hope in a future number to exhibit some cows'\r\nmirrors of different forms and degrees of excellence.--_Rural New Yorker_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO GOOD LAWN TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negundo, or ash-leaved maple, as it is called in the Eastern States,\r\nbetter known at the West as a box elder, is a tree that is not known as\r\nextensively as it deserves. It is a hard maple, that grows as rapidly as\r\nthe soft maple; is hardy, possesses a beautiful foliage of black green\r\nleaves, and is symmetrical in shape. Through eastern Iowa I found it\r\ngrowing wild, and a favorite tree with the early settlers, who wanted\r\nsomething that gave shade and protection to their homes quickly on their\r\nprairie farms. Brought east, its growth is rapid, and it loses none of the\r\ncharacteristics it possessed in its western home. Those who have planted it\r\nare well pleased with it. It is a tree that transplants easily, and I know\r\nof no reason why it should not be more popular.\r\n\r\nFor ornamental lawn planting, I give pre-eminence to the cut-leaf weeping\r\nbirch. Possessing all the good qualities of the white birch, it combines\r\nwith them a beauty and delicate grace yielded by no other tree. It is an\r\nupright grower, with slender, drooping branches, adorned with leaves of\r\ndeep rich green, each leaf being delicately cut, as with a knife, into\r\nsemi-skeletons. It holds its foliage and color till quite late in the fall.\r\nThe bark, with age, becomes white, resembling the white birch, and the\r\nbeauty of the tree increases with its age. It is a free grower, and\r\nrequires no trimming. Nature has given it a symmetry which art cannot\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\nH.T.J.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING SODS FOR LAWNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a very good sod layer, and used to lay very large lawns--half to\r\nthree-quarters of an acre. I cut the sods as follows: Take a board eight to\r\nnine inches wide, four, five, or six feet long, and cut downward all around\r\nthe board, then turn the board over and cut again alongside the edge of the\r\nboard, and so on as many sods as needed. Then cut the turf with a sharp\r\nspade, all the same lengths. Begin on one end, and roll together. Eight\r\ninches by five feet is about as much as a man can handle conveniently. It\r\nis very easy to load them on a wagon, cart, or barrow, and they can be\r\nquickly laid. After laying a good piece, sprinkle a little with a watering\r\npot, if the sods are dry; then use the back of the spade to smooth them a\r\nlittle. If a very fine effect is wanted, throw a shovelful or two of good\r\nearth over each square yard, and smooth it with the back of a steel rake.\r\n\r\nF.H.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[COUNTRY GENTLEMAN.]\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Western New York Society met at Rochester, January 26.\r\n\r\n_New Apples, Pears, Grapes, etc._--Wm. C Barry, secretary of the committee\r\non native fruits, read a full report. Among the older varieties of the\r\napple, he strongly recommended Button Beauty, which had proved so excellent\r\nin Massachusetts, and which had been equally successful at the Mount\r\nHope Nurseries at Rochester; the fine growth of the tree and its great\r\nproductiveness being strongly in its favor. The Wagener and Northern Spy\r\nare among the finer sorts. The Melon is one of the best among the older\r\nsorts; the fruit being quite tender will not bear long shipment, but it\r\npossesses great value for home use, and being a poor grower, it had been\r\nthrown aside by nurserymen and orchardists. It should be top-grafted on\r\nmore vigorous sorts. The Jonathan is another fine sort of slender growth,\r\nwhich should be top-grafted.\r\n\r\nAmong new pears, Hoosic and Frederic Clapp were highly commended for their\r\nexcellence. Some of the older peaches of fine quality had of late been\r\nneglected, and among them Druid Hill and Brevoort.\r\n\r\nAmong the many new peaches highly recommended for their early ripening,\r\nthere was great resemblance to each other, and some had proved earlier than\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nOf the new grapes, Lady Washington was the most promising. The Secretary\r\nwas a failure. The Jefferson was a fine sort, of high promise.\r\n\r\nAmong the new white grapes, Niagara, Prentiss, and Duchess stood\r\npre-eminent, and were worthy of the attention of cultivators. The\r\nVergennes, from Vermont, a light amber colored sort, was also highly\r\ncommended. The Elvira, so highly valued in Missouri, does not succeed well\r\nhere. Several facts were stated in relation to the Delaware grape, showing\r\nits reliability and excellence.\r\n\r\nSeveral new varieties of the raspberry were named, but few of them were\r\nfound equal to the best old sorts. If Brinckle's Orange were taken as a\r\nstandard for quality, it would show that none had proved its equal in fine\r\nquality. The Caroline was like it in color, but inferior in flavor. The New\r\nRochelle was of second quality. Turner was a good berry, but too soft for\r\ndistant carriage.\r\n\r\nOf the many new strawberries named, each seemed to have some special\r\ndrawback. The Bidwell, however, was a new sort of particular excellence,\r\nand Charles Downing thinks it the most promising of the new berries.\r\n\r\n_Discussion on Grapes._--C. W. Beadle, of Ontario, in allusion to Moore's\r\nEarly grape, finds it much earlier than the Concord, and equal to it in\r\nquality, ripening even before the Hartford. S. D. Willard, of Geneva,\r\nthought it inferior to the Concord, and not nearly so good as the Worden.\r\nThe last named was both earlier and better than the Concord, and sold for\r\nseven cents per pound when the Concord brought only four cents. C. A.\r\nGreen, of Monroe County, said the Lady Washington proved to be a very fine\r\ngrape, slightly later than Concord. P. L. Perry, of Canandaigua, said\r\nthat the Vergennes ripens with Hartford, and possesses remarkable keeping\r\nqualities, and is of excellent quality and free from pulp. He presented\r\nspecimens which had been kept in good condition. He added, in relation to\r\nthe Worden grape, that some years ago it brought 18 cents per pound in New\r\nYork when the Concord sold three days later for only 8 cents. [In such\r\ncomparisons, however, it should be borne in mind that new varieties usually\r\nreceive more attention and better culture, giving them an additional\r\nadvantage.]\r\n\r\nThe Niagara grape received special attention from members. A. C. Younglove,\r\nof Yates County, thought it superior to any other white grape for its many\r\ngood qualities. It was a vigorous and healthy grower, and the clusters were\r\nfull and handsome. W. J. Fowler, of Monroe County, saw the vine in October,\r\nwith the leaves still hanging well, a great bearer and the grape of fine\r\nquality. C. L. Hoag, of Lockport, said he began to pick the Niagara on the\r\n26th of August, but its quality improved by hanging on the vine. J. Harris,\r\nof Niagara County, was well acquainted with the Niagara, and indorsed all\r\nthe commendation which had been uttered in its favor. T. C. Maxwell said\r\nthere was one fault--we could not get it, as it was not in market. W. C.\r\nBarry, of Rochester, spoke highly of the Niagara, and its slight foxiness\r\nwould be no objection to those who like that peculiarity. C. L. Hoag\r\nthought this was the same quality that Col. Wilder described as \"a little\r\naromatic.\" A. C. Younglove found the Niagara to ripen with the Delaware.\r\nInquiry being made relative to the Pockington grape, H. E. Hooker said it\r\nripened as early as the Concord. C. A. Green was surprised that it had not\r\nattracted more attention, as he regarded it as a very promising grape. J.\r\nCharlton, of Rochester, said that the fruit had been cut for market on the\r\n29th of August, and on the 6th of September it was fully ripe; but he has\r\nknown it to hang as late as November. J. S. Stone had found that when it\r\nhung as late as November it became sweet and very rich in flavor.\r\n\r\n_New Peaches._--A. C. Younglove had found such very early sorts as\r\nAlexander and Amsden excellent for home use, but not profitable for market.\r\nThe insects and birds made heavy depredations on them. While nearly all\r\nvery early and high-colored sorts suffer largely from the birds, the\r\nRivers, a white peach, does not attract them, and hence it may be\r\nprofitable for market if skillfully packed; rough and careless handling\r\nwill spoil the fruit. He added that the Wheatland peach sustains its high\r\nreputation, and he thought it the best of all sorts for market, ripening\r\nwith Late Crawford. It is a great bearer, but carries a crop of remarkably\r\nuniform size, so that it is not often necessary to throw out a bad\r\nspecimen. This is the result of experience with it by Mr. Rogers at\r\nWheatland, in Monroe County, and at his own residence in Vine Valley. S. D.\r\nWillard confirmed all that Mr. Younglove had said of the excellence of the\r\nRivers peach. He had ripened the Amsden for several years, and found it\r\nabout two weeks earlier than the Rivers, and he thought if the Amsden were\r\nproperly thinned, it would prevent the common trouble of its rotting; such\r\nhad been his experience. E. A. Bronson, of Geneva, objected to making very\r\nearly peaches prominent for marketing, as purchasers would prefer waiting\r\na few days to paying high prices for the earliest, and he would caution\r\npeople against planting the Amsden too largely, and its free recommendation\r\nmight mislead. May's Choice was named by H. E. Hooker as a beautiful yellow\r\npeach, having no superior in quality, but perhaps it may not be found\r\nto have more general value than Early and Late Crawford. It is scarcely\r\ndistinguishable in appearance from fine specimens of Early Crawford. W. C.\r\nBarry was called on for the most recent experience with the Waterloo,\r\nbut said he was not at home when it ripened, but he learned that it had\r\nsustained its reputation. A. C. Younglove said that the Salway is the best\r\nlate peach, ripening eight or ten days after the Smock. S. D. Willard\r\nmentioned an orchard near Geneva, consisting of 25 Salway trees, which for\r\nfour years had ripened their crop and had sold for $4 per bushel in the\r\nPhiladelphia market, or for $3 at Geneva--a higher price than for any other\r\nsort--and the owner intends to plant 200 more trees. W. C. Barry said the\r\nSalway will not ripen at Rochester. Hill's Chili was named by some members\r\nas a good peach for canning and drying, some stating that it ripens before\r\nand others after Late Crawford. It requires thinning on the tree, or\r\nthe fruit will be poor. The Allen was pronounced by Mr. Younglove as an\r\nexcellent, intensely high-colored late peach.\r\n\r\n_Insects Affecting Horticulture_.--Mr. Zimmerman spoke of the importance\r\nof all cultivators knowing so much of insects and their habits as to\r\ndistinguish their friends from their enemies. When unchecked they increase\r\nin an immense ratio, and he mentioned as an instance that the green fly\r\n(_Aphis_) in five generations may become the parent of six thousand million\r\ndescendants. It is necessary, then, to know what other insects are employed\r\nin holding them in check, by feeding on them. Some of our most formidable\r\ninsects have been accidentally imported from Europe, such as the codling\r\nmoth, asparagus beetle, cabbage butterfly, currant worm and borer, elm-tree\r\nbeetle, hessian fly, etc.; but in nearly every instance these have come\r\nover without bringing their insect enemies with them, and in consequence\r\nthey have spread more extensively here than in Europe. It was therefore\r\nurged that the Agricultural Department at Washington be requested to\r\nimport, as far as practicable, such parasites as are positively known to\r\nprey on noxious insects. The cabbage fly eluded our keen custom-house\r\nofficials in 1866, and has enjoyed free citizenship ever since. By\r\naccident, one of its insect enemies (a small black fly) was brought over\r\nwith it, and is now doing excellent work by keeping the cabbage fly in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe codling moth, one of the most formidable fruit destroyers, may be\r\nreduced in number by the well-known paper bands; but a more efficient\r\nremedy is to shower them early in the season with Paris green, mixed in\r\nwater at the rate of only one pound to one hundred gallons of water, with\r\na forcing pump, soon after blossoming. After all the experiments made and\r\nrepellents used for the plum curculio, the jarring method is found the most\r\nefficient and reliable, if properly performed. Various remedies for insects\r\nsometimes have the credit of doing the work, if used in those seasons\r\nwhen the insects happen to be few. With some insects, the use of oil is\r\nadvantageous, as it always closes up their breathing holes and suffocates\r\nthem. The oil should be mixed with milk, and then diluted as required, as\r\nthe oil alone cannot be mixed with the water. As a general remedy,\r\nParis green is the strongest that can be applied. A teaspoonful to a\r\ntablespoonful, in a barrel of water, is enough. Hot water is the best\r\nremedy for house plants. Place one hand over the soil, invert the pot, and\r\nplunge the foliage for a second only at a time in water heated to from 150°\r\nto 200°F, according to the plants; or apply with a fine rose. The yeast\r\nremedy has not proved successful in all cases.\r\n\r\nAmong beneficial insects, there are about one hundred species of lady bugs,\r\nand, so far as known, all are beneficial. Cultivators should know them.\r\nThey destroy vast quantities of plant lice. The ground beetles are mostly\r\ncannibals, and should not be destroyed. The large black beetle, with\r\ncoppery dots, makes short work with the Colorado potato beetles; and\r\na bright green beetle will climb trees to get a meal of canker worms.\r\nIchneumon flies are among our most useful insects. The much-abused dragon\r\nflies are perfectly harmless to us, but destroy many mosquitoes and flies.\r\n\r\nAmong insects that attack large fruits is the codling moth, to be destroyed\r\nby paper bands, or with Paris green showered in water. The round-headed\r\napple-tree borer is to be cut out, and the eggs excluded with a sheet of\r\ntarred paper around the stem, and slightly sunk in the earth. For the\r\noyster-shell bark louse, apply linseed oil. Paris green, in water,\r\nwill kill the canker worm. Tobacco water does the work for plant lice.\r\nPeach-tree borers are excluded with tarred or felt paper, and cut out with\r\na knife. Jar the grape flea beetle on an inverted umbrella early in the\r\nmorning. Among small-fruit insects, the strawberry worms are readily\r\ndestroyed with hellebore, an ounce to a gallon of warm water. The same\r\nremedy destroys the imported currant worm.\r\n\r\n_Insect Destroyers_.--Prof. W. Saunders, of the Province of Ontario,\r\nfollowed Mr. Zimmerman with a paper on other departments of the same\r\ngeneral subject, which contained much information and many suggestions of\r\ngreat value to cultivators. He had found Paris green an efficient remedy\r\nfor the bud-moth on pear and other trees. He also recommends Paris green\r\nfor the grapevine flea beetle. Hellebore is much better for the pear slug\r\nthan dusting with sand, as these slugs, as soon as their skin is spoiled\r\nby being sanded, cast it off and go on with their work of destruction as\r\nfreely as ever, and this they repeat. He remarked that it is a common error\r\nthat all insects are pests to the cultivator. There are many parasites,\r\nor useful ones, which prey on our insect enemies. Out of 7,000 described\r\ninsects in this country, only about 50 have proved destructive to our\r\ncrops. Parasites are much more numerous. Among lepidopterous insects\r\n(butterflies, etc.), there are very few noxious species; many active\r\nfriends are found among the Hymenoptera (wasps, etc.), the ichneumon flies\r\npre-eminently so; and in the order Hemiptera (bugs proper) are several that\r\ndestroy our enemies. Hence the very common error that birds which destroy\r\ninsects are beneficial to us, as they are more likely to destroy our insect\r\nfriends than the fewer enemies. Those known as _flycatchers_ may do neither\r\nharm nor good; so far as they eat the wheat-midge and Hessian fly they\r\nconfer a positive benefit; in other instances they destroy both friends and\r\nenemies. Birds that are only partly insectivorous, and which eat grain and\r\nfruit, may need further inquiry. Prof. S. had examined the stomachs of many\r\nsuch birds, and particularly of the American robin, and the only curculio\r\nhe ever found in any of these was a single one in a whole cherry which the\r\nbird had bolted entire. Robins had proved very destructive to his grapes,\r\nbut had not assisted at all in protecting his cabbages growing alongside\r\nhis fruit garden. These vegetables were nearly destroyed by the larvae of\r\nthe cabbage fly, which would have afforded the birds many fine, rich meals.\r\nThis comparatively feeble insect has been allowed by the throngs of birds\r\nto spread over the whole continent. A naturalist in one of the Western\r\nStates had examined several species of the thrush, and found they had eaten\r\nmostly that class of insects known as our friends.\r\n\r\nProf. S. spoke of the remedies for root lice, among which were hot water\r\nand bisulphide of carbon. Hot water will get cold before it can reach the\r\nsmaller roots, however efficient it may be showered on leaves. Bisulphide\r\nof carbon is very volatile, inflammable, and sometimes explosive, and must\r\nbe handled with great care. It permeates the soil, and if in sufficient\r\nquantity may be effective in destroying the phylloxera; but its cost and\r\ndangerous character prevent it from being generally recommended.\r\n\r\nParis green is most generally useful for destroying insects. As sold to\r\npurchasers, it is of various grades of purity. The highest in price is\r\ncommonly the purest, and really the cheapest. A difficulty with this\r\nvariable quality is that it cannot be properly diluted with water, and\r\nthose who buy and use a poor article and try its efficacy, will burn or\r\nkill their plants when they happen to use a stronger, purer, and more\r\nefficient one. Or, if the reverse is done, they may pronounce it a humbug\r\nfrom the resulting failure. One teaspoonful, if pure, is enough for a large\r\npail of water; or if mixed with flour, there should be forty or fifty times\r\nas much. Water is best, as the operator will not inhale the dust. London\r\npurple is another form of the arsenic, and has very variable qualities\r\nof the poison, being merely refuse matter from manufactories. It is more\r\nsoluble than Paris green, and hence more likely to scorch plants. On the\r\nwhole, Paris green is much the best and most reliable for common use.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Prof. Saunders' remarks some objections were made by\r\nmembers present to the use of Paris green on fruit soon after blossoming,\r\nand Prof. S. sustained the objection, in that the knowledge that the fruit\r\nhad been showered with it would deter purchasers from receiving it, even if\r\nno poison could remain on it from spring to autumn. A man had brought to\r\nhim potatoes to analyze for arsenic, on which Paris green had been used,\r\nand although it was shown to him that the poison did not reach the roots\r\nbeneath the soil, and if it did it was insoluble and could not enter them,\r\nhe was not satisfied until a careful analysis was made and no arsenic at\r\nall found in them. A member said that in mixing with plaster there should\r\nbe 100 or 150 pounds of plaster to one of the Paris green, and that a\r\nsmaller quantity, by weight, of flour would answer, as that is a more bulky\r\narticle for the same weight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE SALMON OF THE PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nBy DAVID S. JORDAN and CHAS. H. GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the most of the present year, the writers have been engaged in the\r\nstudy of the fishes of the Pacific coast of the United States, in the\r\ninterest of the U.S. Fish Commission and the U.S. Census Bureau. The\r\nfollowing pages contain the principal facts ascertained concerning the\r\nsalmon of the Pacific coast. It is condensed from our report to the U.S.\r\nCensus Bureau, by permission of Professor Goode, assistant in charge of\r\nfishery investigations.\r\n\r\nThere are five species of salmon (Oncorhynchus) in the waters of the North\r\nPacific. We have at present no evidence of the existence of any more on\r\neither the American or the Asiatic side.\r\n\r\nThese species may be called the quinnat or king salmon, the blue-back\r\nsalmon or red-fish, the silver salmon, the dog salmon, and the hump-back\r\nsalmon, or _Oncorhynchus chouicha, nerka, kisutch, keta_, and _gorbuscha_.\r\nAll these species are now known to occur in the waters of Kamtschatka as\r\nwell as in those of Alaska and Oregon.\r\n\r\nAs vernacular names of definite application, the following are on record:\r\n\r\na. Quinnat--Chouicha, king salmon, e'quinna, saw-kwey, Chinnook salmon,\r\nColumbia River salmon, Sacramento salmon, tyee salmon, Monterey salmon,\r\ndeep-water salmon, spring salmon, ek-ul-ba (\"ekewan\") (fall run).\r\n\r\nb. Blue-bock--krasnaya ryba, Alaska red-fish, Idaho red fish, sukkegh,\r\nFrazer's River salmon, rascal, oo-chooy-ha.\r\n\r\nc. Silver salmon--kisutch, winter salmon, hoopid, skowitz, coho, bielaya\r\nryba, o-o-wun.\r\n\r\nd. Dog salmon--kayko, lekai, ktlawhy, qualoch, fall salmon, o-le-a-rah. The\r\nmales of _all_ the species in the fall are usually known as dog salmon, or\r\nfall salmon.\r\n\r\ne. Hump-back--gorbuscha, haddo, hone, holia, lost salmon, Puget Sound\r\nsalmon, dog salmon (of Alaska).\r\n\r\nOf these species, the blue-back predominates in Frazer's River, the silver\r\nsalmon in Puget Sound, the quinnat in the Columbia and the Sacramento, and\r\nthe silver salmon in most of the small streams along the coast. All the\r\nspecies have been seen by us in the Columbia and in Frazer's River; all\r\nbut the blue-back in the Sacramento, and all but the blue-back in waters\r\ntributary to Puget Sound. Only the quinnat has been noticed south of San\r\nFrancisco, and its range has been traced as far as Ventura River, which is\r\nthe southernmost stream in California which is not muddy and alkaline at\r\nits mouth.\r\n\r\nOf these species, the quinnat and blue-back salmon habitually \"run\" in the\r\nspring, the others in the fall. The usual order of running in the rivers is\r\nas follows: _nerka, chouicha, kisutch, gorbuscha, keta_.\r\n\r\nThe economic value of the spring running salmon is far greater than that of\r\nthe other species, because they can be captured in numbers when at their\r\nbest, while the others are usually taken only after deterioration.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the salmon in the ocean are not easily studied. Quinnat and\r\nsilver salmon of every size are taken with the seine at almost any season\r\nin Puget Sound. The quinnat takes the hook freely in Monterey bay, both\r\nnear the shore and at a distance of six or eight miles out. We have reason\r\nto believe that these two species do not necessarily seek great depths, but\r\nprobably remain not very far from the mouth of the rivers in which they\r\nwere spawned.\r\n\r\nThe blue-back and the dog salmon probably seek deeper water, as the former\r\nis seldom or never taken with the seine in the ocean, and the latter is\r\nknown to enter the Straits of Fuca at the spawning season.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the quinnat salmon and nearly all blue-back salmon\r\nenter the rivers in the spring. The run of both begins generally the last\r\nof March; it lasts, with various modifications and interruptions, until\r\nthe actual spawning season in November; the time of running and the\r\nproportionate amount of each of the subordinate runs, varying with each\r\ndifferent river. In general, the runs are slack in the summer and increase\r\nwith the first high water of autumn. By the last of August only straggling\r\nblue-backs can be found in the lower course of any stream, but both in the\r\nColumbia and the Sacramento the quinnat runs in considerable numbers till\r\nOctober at least. In the Sacramento the run is greatest in the fall, and\r\nmore run in the summer than in spring. In the Sacramento and the smaller\r\nrivers southward, there is a winter run, beginning in December.\r\n\r\nThe spring salmon ascend only those rivers which are fed by the melting\r\nsnows from the mountains, and which have sufficient volume to send their\r\nwaters well out to sea. Such rivers are the Sacramento, Rogue, Klamath,\r\nColumbia, and Frazer's rivers.\r\n\r\nThose salmon which run in the spring are chiefly adults (supposed to be at\r\nleast three years old). Their milt and spawn are no more developed than at\r\nthe same time in others of the same species which will not enter the rivers\r\nuntil fall. It would appear that the contact with cold fresh water, when in\r\nthe ocean, in some way caused them to turn toward it and to \"run,\" before\r\nthere is any special influence to that end exerted by the development of\r\nthe organs of generation.\r\n\r\nHigh water on any of these rivers in the spring is always followed by an\r\nincreased run of salmon. The canners think, and this is probably true, that\r\nsalmon which would not have run till later are brought up by the contact\r\nwith the cold water. The cause of this effect of cold fresh water is not\r\nunderstood. We may call it an instinct of the salmon, which is another way\r\nof expressing our ignorance. In general, it seems to be true that in those\r\nrivers and during those years when the spring run is greatest, the fall run\r\nis least to be depended on.\r\n\r\nAs the season advances, smaller and younger salmon of these two species\r\n(quinnat and blue-back) enter the rivers to spawn, and in the fall these\r\nyoung specimens are very numerous. We have thus far failed to notice any\r\ngradations in size or appearance of these young fish by which their ages\r\ncould be ascertained. It is, however, probable that some of both sexes\r\nreproduce at the age of one year. In Frazer's River, in the fall, quinnat\r\nmale grilse of every size, from eight inches upward, were running, the milt\r\nfully developed, but usually not showing the hooked jaws and dark colors\r\nof the older males. Females less than eighteen inches in length were rare.\r\nAll, large and small, then in the river, of either sex, had the ovaries or\r\nmilt well developed.\r\n\r\nLittle blue-backs of every size down to six inches are also found in\r\nthe Upper Columbia in the fall, with their organs of generation fully\r\ndeveloped. Nineteen twentieths of these young fish are males, and some of\r\nthem have the hooked jaws and red color of the old males.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of the quinnat in the Columbia in the spring is\r\ntwenty-two pounds; in the Sacramento about sixteen. Individuals weighing\r\nfrom forty to sixty pounds are frequently found in both rivers, and some as\r\nhigh as eighty pounds are reported. It is questioned whether these large\r\nfishes are:\r\n\r\n(_a_.) Those which, of the same age, have grown more rapidly;\r\n\r\n(_b_.) Those which are older but have, for some reason, failed to spawn;\r\nor,\r\n\r\n(_c_.) Those which have survived one or more spawning seasons.\r\n\r\nAll of these origins may be possible in individual cases; we are, however,\r\nof the opinion that the majority of these large fish are those which have\r\nhitherto run in the fall and so may have survived the spawning season\r\nprevious.\r\n\r\nThose fish which enter the rivers in the spring continue their ascent until\r\ndeath or the spawning season overtakes them. Probably none of them ever\r\nreturn to the ocean, and a large proportion fail to spawn. They are known\r\nto ascend the Sacramento as far as the base of Mount Shasta, or to its\r\nextreme head-waters, about four hundred miles. In the Columbia they are\r\nknown to ascend as far as the Bitter Root Mountains, and as far as the\r\nSpokan Falls, and their extreme limit is not known. This is a distance of\r\nsix to eight hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAt these great distances, when the fish have reached the spawning grounds,\r\nbesides the usual changes of the breeding season, their bodies are covered\r\nwith bruises on which patches of white fungus develop. The fins become\r\nmutilated, their eyes are often injured or destroyed; parasitic worms\r\ngather in their gills, they become extremely emaciated, their flesh\r\nbecomes white from the loss of the oil, and as soon as the spawning act\r\nis accomplished, and sometimes before, all of them die. The ascent of the\r\nCascades and the Dalles probably causes the injury or death of a great many\r\nsalmon.\r\n\r\nWhen the salmon enter the river they refuse bait, and their stomachs are\r\nalways found empty and contracted. In the rivers they do not feed, and when\r\nthey reach the spawning grounds their stomachs, pyloric coeca and all, are\r\nsaid to be no larger than one's finger. They will sometimes take the\r\nfly, or a hook baited with salmon roe, in the clear waters of the upper\r\ntributaries, but there is no other evidence known to us that they feed when\r\nthere. Only the quinnat and blue-back (then called red-fish) have been\r\nfound in the fall at any great distance from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe spawning season is probably about the same for all the species. It\r\nvaries for all in different rivers and in different parts of the same\r\nriver, and doubtless extends from July to December.\r\n\r\nThe manner of spawning is probably similar for all the species, but we have\r\nno data for any except the quinnat. In this species the fish pair off, the\r\nmale, with tail and snout, excavates a broad shallow \"nest\" in the gravelly\r\nbed of the stream, in rapid water, at a depth of one to four feet; the\r\nfemale deposits her eggs in it, and after the exclusion of the milt, they\r\ncover them with stones and gravel. They then float down the stream tail\r\nforemost. A great majority of them die. In the head-waters of the large\r\nstreams all die, unquestionably. In the small streams, and near the sea, an\r\nunknown percentage probably survive. The young hatch in about sixty days,\r\nand most of them return to the ocean during the high water of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe salmon of all kinds in the spring are silvery, spotted or not according\r\nto the species, and with the mouth about equally symmetrical in both sexes.\r\n\r\nAs the spawning season approaches the female loses her silvery color,\r\nbecomes more slimy, the scales on the back partly sink into the skin, and\r\nthe flesh changes from salmon red and becomes variously paler, from the\r\nloss of the oil, the degree of paleness varying much with individuals and\r\nwith inhabitants of different rivers.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Sacramento the flesh of the quinnat in either spring or fall\r\nis rarely pale. In the Columbia, a few with pale flesh are sometimes taken\r\nin spring, and a good many in the fall. In Frazer's River the fall run of\r\nthe quinnat is nearly worthless for canning purposes, because so many are\r\nwhite meated. In the spring very few are white meated, but the number\r\nincreases towards fall, when there is every variation, some having red\r\nstreaks running through them, others being red toward the head and pale\r\ntoward the tail. The red and pale ones cannot be distinguished externally,\r\nand the color is dependent neither on age nor sex. There is said to be no\r\ndifference in the taste, but there is no market for canned salmon not of\r\nthe conventional orange color.\r\n\r\nAs the season advances, the differences between the males and the females\r\nbecome more and more marked, and keep pace with the development of the\r\nmilt, as is shown by dissection.\r\n\r\nThe males have: (_a_.) The premaxillaries and the tip of the lower jaw\r\nmore and more prolonged; both of them becoming finally strongly and often\r\nextravagantly hooked, so that either they shut by the side of each other\r\nlike shears, or else the mouth cannot be closed. (_b_.) The front teeth\r\nbecome very long and canine-like, their growth proceeding very rapidly,\r\nuntil they are often half an inch long. (_c_.) The teeth on the vomer and\r\ntongue often disappear. (_d_.) The body grows more compressed and deeper\r\nat the shoulders, so that a very distinct hump is formed; this is more\r\ndeveloped in _0. gorbuscha_, but is found in all. (_e_.) The scales\r\ndisappear, especially on the back, by the growth of spongy skin. (_f_.) The\r\ncolor changes from silvery to various shades of black and red or blotchy,\r\naccording to the species. The blue-back turns rosy red, the dog salmon a\r\ndull, blotchy red, and the quiunat generally blackish.\r\n\r\nThese distorted males are commonly considered worthless, rejected by the\r\ncanners and salmon-salters, but preserved by the Indians. These changes are\r\ndue solely to influences connected with the growth of the testes. They are\r\nnot in any way due to the action of fresh water. They take place at about\r\nthe same time in the adult males of all species, whether in the ocean or\r\nin the rivers. At the time of the spring runs all are symmetrical. In the\r\nfall, all males of whatever species are more or less distorted. Among the\r\ndog salmon, which run only in the fall, the males are hooked-jawed and\r\nred-blotched when they first enter the Straits of Fuca from the outside.\r\nThe hump-back, taken in salt water about Seattle, shows the same\r\npeculiarities. The male is slab-sided, hook-billed, and distorted, and is\r\nrejected by the canners. No hook-jawed _females_ of any species have been\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIt is not positively known that any hook-jawed male survives the\r\nreproductive act. If any do, their jaws must resume the normal form.\r\n\r\nOn first entering a stream the salmon swim about as if playing: they always\r\nhead toward the current, and this \"playing\" may be simply due to facing the\r\nflood tide. Afterwards they enter the deepest parts of the stream and swim\r\nstraight up, with few interruptions. Their rate of travel on the Sacramento\r\nis estimated by Stone at about two miles per day; on the Columbia at about\r\nthree miles per day.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the economic value of any species depends in great part\r\non its being a \"spring salmon.\" It is not generally possible to capture\r\nsalmon of any species in large numbers until they have entered the rivers,\r\nand the spring salmon enter the rivers long before the growth of the organs\r\nof reproduction has reduced the richness of the flesh. The fall salmon\r\ncannot be taken in quantity until their flesh has deteriorated: hence the\r\n\"dog salmon\" is practically almost worthless, except to the Indians, and\r\nthe hump-back salmon is little better. The silver salmon, with the same\r\nbreeding habits as the dog salmon, is more valuable, as it is found in\r\nPuget Sound for a considerable time before the fall rains cause the fall\r\nruns, and it may be taken in large numbers with seines before the season\r\nfor entering the rivers. The quinnat salmon, from its great size and\r\nabundance, is more valuable than all other fishes on our Pacific coast\r\ntogether. The blue back, similar in flesh but much smaller and less\r\nabundant, is worth much more than the combined value of the three remaining\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe fall salmon of all species, but especially the dog salmon, ascend\r\nstreams but a short distance before spawning. They seem to be in great\r\nanxiety to find fresh water, and many of them work their way up little\r\nbrooks only a few inches deep, where they soon perish miserably,\r\nfloundering about on the stones. Every stream, of whatever kind, has more\r\nor less of these fall salmon.\r\n\r\nIt is the prevailing impression that the salmon have some special instinct\r\nwhich leads them to return to spawn in the same spawning grounds where they\r\nwere originally hatched. We fail to find any evidence of this in the case\r\nof the Pacific coast salmon, and we do not believe it to be true. It seems\r\nmore probable that the young salmon, hatched in any river, mostly remain in\r\nthe ocean within a radius of twenty, thirty, or forty miles of its mouth.\r\nThese, in their movements about in the ocean, may come into contact with\r\nthe cold waters of their parent rivers, or perhaps of any other river, at\r\na considerable distance from the shore. In the case of the quinnat and the\r\nblue-back, their \"instinct\" leads them to ascend these fresh waters, and\r\nin a majority of cases these waters will be those in which the fishes in\r\nquestion were originally spawned. Later in the season the growth of the\r\nreproductive organs leads them to approach the shore and to search for\r\nfresh waters, and still the chances are that they may find the original\r\nstream. But undoubtedly many fall salmon ascend, or try to ascend, streams\r\nin which no salmon was ever hatched.\r\n\r\nIt is said of the Russian River and other California rivers, that their\r\nmouths in the time of low water in summer generally become entirely closed\r\nby sand bars, and that the salmon, in their eagerness to ascend them,\r\nfrequently fling themselves entirely out of water on the beach. But this\r\ndoes not prove that the salmon are guided by a marvelous geographical\r\ninstinct which leads them to their parent river. The waters of Russian\r\nRiver soak through these sand bars, and the salmon \"instinct,\" we think,\r\nleads them merely to search for fresh waters.\r\n\r\nThis matter is much in need of further investigation; at present, however,\r\nwe find no reason to believe that the salmon enter the Rogue River simply\r\nbecause they were spawned there, or that a salmon hatched in the Clackamas\r\nRiver is any the more likely on that account to return to the Clackamas\r\nthan to go up the Cowlitz or the Deschutes.\r\n\r\n\"At the hatchery on Rogue River, the fish are stripped, marked and set\r\nfree, and every year since the hatchery has been in operation some of the\r\nmarked fish have been re-caught. The young fry are also marked, but none of\r\nthem have been recaught.\"\r\n\r\nThis year the run of silver salmon in Frazer's River was very light, while\r\non Puget Sound the run was said by the Indians to be greater than ever\r\nknown before. Both these cases may be due to the same cause, the dry\r\nsummer, low water, and consequent failure of the salmon to find the rivers.\r\nThe run in the Sound is much more irregular than in the large rivers. One\r\nyear they will abound in one bay and its tributary stream and hardly be\r\nseen in another, while the next year the condition will be reversed. At\r\nCape Flattery the run of silver salmon for the present year was very small,\r\nwhich fact was generally attributed by the Indians to the birth of twins at\r\nNeah Bay.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the diminution of the number of salmon on the coast. In\r\nPuget's Sound, Frazer's River, and the smaller streams, there appears to be\r\nlittle or no evidence of this. In the Columbia River the evidence appears\r\nsomewhat conflicting; the catch during the present year (1880) has been\r\nconsiderably greater than ever before (nearly 540,000 cases of 48 lb. each\r\nhaving been packed), although the fishing for three or four years has been\r\nvery extensive. On the other hand, the high water of the present spring has\r\nundoubtedly caused many fish to become spring salmon which would otherwise\r\nhave run in the fall. Moreover, it is urged that a few years ago, when the\r\nnumber caught was about half as great as now, the amount of netting used\r\nwas perhaps one-eighth as much. With a comparatively small outfit the\r\ncanners caught half the fish, now with nets much larger and more numerous,\r\nthey catch them all, scarcely any escaping during the fishing season (April\r\n1 to August 1). Whether an actual reduction in the number of fish running\r\ncan be proven or not, there can be no question that the present rate of\r\ndestruction of the salmon will deplete the river before many years. A\r\nconsiderable number of quinnat salmon run in August and September, and some\r\nstragglers even later; these now are all which keep up the supply of\r\nfish in the river. The non-molestation of this fall run, therefore, does\r\nsomething to atone for the almost total destruction of the spring run.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is insufficient. A well-ordered salmon hatchery is the only\r\nmeans by which the destruction of the salmon in the river can be prevented.\r\nThis hatchery should be under the control of Oregon and Washington, and\r\nshould be supported by a tax levied on the canned fish. It should be placed\r\non a stream where the quinnat salmon actually come to spawn.\r\n\r\nIt has been questioned whether the present hatchery on the Clackamas River\r\nactually receives the quinnat salmon in any numbers. It is asserted, in\r\nfact, that the eggs of the silver salmon and dog salmon, with scattering\r\nquinnat, are hatched there. We have no exact information as to the truth of\r\nthese reports, but the matter should be taken into serious consideration.\r\n\r\nOn the Sacramento there is no doubt of the reduction of the number of\r\nsalmon; this is doubtless mainly attributable to over-fishing, but in part\r\nit may be due to the destruction of spawning beds by mining operations and\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\nAs to the superiority of the Columbia River salmon, there is no doubt that\r\nthe quinnat salmon average larger and fatter in the Columbia than in the\r\nSacramento and in Puget Sound. The difference in the canned fish is,\r\nhowever, probably hardly appreciable. The canned salmon from the Columbia,\r\nhowever, bring a better price in the market than those from elsewhere. The\r\ncanners there generally have had a high regard for the reputation of\r\nthe river, and have avoided canning fall fish or species other than the\r\nquinnat. In the Frazer's River the blue-back is largely canned, and its\r\nflesh being a little more watery and perhaps paler, is graded below the\r\nquinnat. On Puget Sound various species are canned; in fact, everything\r\nwith red flesh. The best canners on the Sacramento apparently take equal\r\ncare with their product with those of the Columbia, but they depend largely\r\non the somewhat inferior fall run. There are, however, sometimes salmon\r\ncanned in San Francisco, which have been in the city markets, and for some\r\nreason remaining unsold, have been sent to the canners; such salmon are\r\nunfit for food, and canning them should be prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the hump-back salmon runs only on alternate years in Puget\r\nSound (1875, 1877, 1879, etc.) is well attested and at present unexplained.\r\nStray individuals only are taken in other years. This species has a\r\ndistinct \"run,\" in the United States, only in Puget Sound, although\r\nindividuals (called \"lost salmon\") are occasionally taken in the Columbia\r\nand in the Sacramento.--_American Naturalist._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION BETWEEN ELECTRICITY AND LIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A lecture by Dr. O. J. Lodge, delivered at the London\r\nInstitution on December 16, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the subject on which I have the honor to speak to you to-night\r\nwas arranged, I have been astonished at my own audacity in proposing to\r\ndeal in the course of sixty minutes with a subject so gigantic and so\r\nprofound that a course of sixty lectures would be quite inadequate for its\r\nthorough and exhaustive treatment.\r\n\r\nI must indeed confine myself carefully to some few of the typical and most\r\nsalient points in the relation between electricity and light, and I must\r\neconomize time by plunging at once into the middle of the matter without\r\nfurther preliminaries.\r\n\r\nNow, when a person is setting off to discuss the relation between\r\nelectricity and light, it is very natural and very proper to pull him up\r\nshort with the two questions: What do you mean by electricity? and What do\r\nyou mean by light? These two questions I intend to try briefly to answer.\r\nAnd here let me observe that in answering these fundamental questions, I do\r\nnot necessarily assume a fundamental ignorance on your part of these two\r\nagents, but rather the contrary; and must beg you to remember that if I\r\nrepeat well-known and simple experiments before you, it is for the purpose\r\nof directing attention to their real meaning and significance, not to their\r\nobvious and superficial characteristics; in the same way that I might\r\nrepeat the exceedingly familiar experiment of dropping a stone to the earth\r\nif we were going to define what we meant by gravitation.\r\n\r\nNow, then, we will ask first, What is electricity? and the simple answer\r\nmust be, We don't know. Well, but this need not necessarily be depressing.\r\nIf the same question were asked about matter, or about energy, we should\r\nhave likewise to reply, No one knows.\r\n\r\nBut then the term Matter is a very general one, and so is the term Energy.\r\nThey are heads, in fact, under which we classify more special phenomena.\r\n\r\nThus, if we were asked, What is sulphur? or what is selenium? we should at\r\nleast be able to reply, A form of matter; and then proceed to describe its\r\nproperties, _i. e._, how it affected our bodies and other bodies.\r\n\r\nAgain, to the question, What is heat? we can reply, A form of energy; and\r\nproceed to describe the peculiarities which distinguish it from other forms\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\nBut to the question. What is electricity? we have no answer pat like this.\r\nWe can not assert that it is a form of matter, neither can we deny it; on\r\nthe other hand, we certainly can not assert that it is a form of energy,\r\nand I should be disposed to deny it. It may be that electricity is an\r\nentity _per se_, just as matter is an entity _per se_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I can tell you what I mean by electricity by appealing to its\r\nknown behavior.\r\n\r\nHere is a battery, that is, an electricity pump; it will drive electricity\r\nalong. Prof. Ayrtou is going, I am afraid, to tell you, on the 20th of\r\nJanuary next, that it _produces_ electricity; but if he does, I hope you\r\nwill remember that that is exactly what neither it nor anything else can\r\ndo. It is as impossible to generate electricity in the sense I am trying to\r\ngive the word, as it is to produce matter. Of course I need hardly say that\r\nProf. Ayrton knows this perfectly well; it is merely a question of words,\r\n_i. e._, of what you understand by the word electricity.\r\n\r\nI want you, then, to regard this battery and all electrical machines and\r\nbatteries as kinds of electricity pumps, which drive the electricity along\r\nthrough the wire very much as a water-pump can drive water along pipes.\r\nWhile this is going on the wire manifests a whole series of properties,\r\nwhich are called the properties of the current.\r\n\r\n[Here were shown an ignited platinum wire, the electric arc between two\r\ncarbons, an electric machine spark, an induction coil spark, and a vacuum\r\ntube glow. Also a large nail was magnetized by being wrapped in the\r\ncurrent, and two helices were suspended and seen to direct and attract each\r\nother.]\r\n\r\nTo make a magnet, then, we only need a current of electricity flowing round\r\nand round in a whirl. A vortex or whirlpool of electricity is in fact a\r\nmagnet; and _vice versa_. And these whirls have the power of directing and\r\nattracting other previously existing whirls according to certain laws,\r\ncalled the laws of magnetism. And, moreover, they have the power of\r\nexciting fresh whirls in neighboring conductors, and of repelling them\r\naccording to the laws of diamagnetism. The theory of the actions is known,\r\nthough the nature of the whirls, as of the simple stream of electricity, is\r\nat present unknown.\r\n\r\n[Here was shown a large electro-magnet and an induction-coil vacuum\r\ndischarge spinning round and round when placed in its field.]\r\n\r\nSo much for what happens when electricity is made to travel along\r\nconductors, _i. e._, when it travels along like a stream of water in a\r\npipe, or spins round and round like a whirlpool.\r\n\r\nBut there is another set of phenomena, usually regarded as distinct and of\r\nanother order, but which are not so distinct as they appear, which\r\nmanifest themselves when you join the pump to a piece of glass, or any\r\nnon-conductor, and try to force the electricity through that. You succeed\r\nin driving some through, but the flow is no longer like that of water in an\r\nopen pipe; it is as if the pipe were completely obstructed by a number of\r\nelastic partitions or diaphragms. The water can not move without straining\r\nand bending these diaphragms, and if you allow it, these strained\r\npartitions will recover themselves, and drive the water back again. [Here\r\nwas explained the process of charging a Leyden jar.] The essential thing to\r\nremember is that we may have electrical energy in two forms, the static\r\nand the kinetic; and it is, therefore, also possible to have the rapid\r\nalternation from one of these forms to the other, called vibration.\r\n\r\nNow we will pass to the second question: What do you mean by light? And the\r\nfirst and obvious answer is, Everybody knows. And everybody that is not\r\nblind does know to a certain extent. We have a special sense organ for\r\nappreciating light, whereas we have none for electricity. Nevertheless, we\r\nmust admit that we really know very little about the intimate nature of\r\nlight--very little more than about electricity. But we do know this,\r\nthat light is a form of energy, and, moreover, that it is energy rapidly\r\nalternating between the static and the kinetic forms--that it is, in fact,\r\na special kind of energy of vibration. We are absolutely certain that light\r\nis a periodic disturbance in some medium, periodic both in space and time;\r\nthat is to say, the same appearances regularly recur at certain equal\r\nintervals of distance at the same time, and also present themselves at\r\nequal intervals of time at the same place; that in fact it belongs to the\r\nclass of motions called by mathematicians undulatory or wave motions. The\r\nwave motion in this model (Powell's wave apparatus) results from the simple\r\nup and down motion popularly associated with the term wave. But when\r\na mathematician calls a thing a wave he means that the disturbance is\r\nrepresented by a certain general type of formula, not that it is an\r\nup-and-down motion, or that it looks at all like those things on the top of\r\nthe sea. The motion of the surface of the sea falls within that formula,\r\nand hence is a special variety of wave motion, and the term wave has\r\nacquired in popular use this signification and nothing else. So that when\r\none speaks ordinarily of a wave or undulatory motion, one immediately\r\nthinks of something heaving up and down, or even perhaps of something\r\nbreaking on the shore. But when we assert that the form of energy called\r\nlight is undulatory, we by no means intend to assert that anything whatever\r\nis moving up and down, or that the motion, if we could see it, would be\r\nanything at all like what we are accustomed to in the ocean. The kind of\r\nmotion is unknown; we are not even sure that there is anything like motion\r\nin the ordinary sense of the word at all.\r\n\r\nNow, how much connection between electricity and light have we perceived in\r\nthis glance into their natures? Not much, truly. It amounts to about\r\nthis: That on the one hand electrical energy may exist in either of two\r\nforms--the static form, when insulators are electrically strained by having\r\nhad electricity driven partially through them (as in the Leyden jar), which\r\nstrain is a form of energy because of the tendency to discharge and do\r\nwork; and the kinetic form, where electricity is moving bodily along\r\nthrough conductors or whirling round and round inside them, which motion\r\nof electricity is a form of energy, because the conductors and whirls can\r\nattract or repel each other and thereby do work.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other hand, that light is the rapid alternation of energy\r\nfrom one of these forms to the other--the static form where the medium is\r\nstrained, to the kinetic form when it moves. It is just conceivable, then,\r\nthat the static form of the energy of light is _electro_ static, that is,\r\nthat the medium is _electrically_ strained, and that the kinetic form of\r\nthe energy of light is _electro_-kinetic, that is, that the motion is\r\nnot ordinary motion, but electrical motion--in fact, that light is an\r\nelectrical vibration, not a material one.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, last year, there died at Cambridge a man in the full\r\nvigor of his faculties--such faculties as do not appear many times in a\r\ncentury--whose chief work has been the establishment of this very fact, the\r\ndiscovery of the link connecting light and electricity; and the proof--for\r\nI believe it amounts to a proof--that they are different manifestations\r\nof one and the same class of phenomena--that light is, in fact, an\r\nelectro-magnetic disturbance. The premature death of James Clerk-Maxwell is\r\na loss to science which appears at present utterly irreparable, for he was\r\nengaged in researches that no other man can hope as yet adequately to grasp\r\nand follow out; but fortunately it did not occur till he had published his\r\nbook on \"Electricity and Magnetism,\" one of those immortal productions\r\nwhich exalt one's idea of the mind of man, and which has been mentioned by\r\ncompetent critics in the same breath as the \"Principia\" itself.\r\n\r\nBut it is not perfect like the \"Principia;\" much of it is rough-hewn, and\r\nrequires to be thoroughly worked out. It contains numerous misprints and\r\nerrata, and part of the second volume is so difficult as to be almost\r\nunintelligible. Some, in fact, consists of notes written for private use\r\nand not intended for publication. It seems next to impossible now to mature\r\na work silently for twenty or thirty years, as was done by Newton two and a\r\nhalf centuries ago. But a second edition was preparing, and much might have\r\nbeen improved in form if life had been spared to the illustrious author.\r\n\r\nThe main proof of the electro-magnetic theory of light is this: The rate at\r\nwhich light travels has been measured many times, and is pretty well known.\r\nThe rate at which an electro-magnetic wave disturbance would travel if such\r\ncould be generated (and Mr. Fitzgerald, of Dublin, thinks he has proved\r\nthat it can not be generated directly by any known electrical means) can\r\nbe also determined by calculation from electrical measurements. The two\r\nvelocities agree exactly. This is the great physical constant known as the\r\nratio V, which so many physicists have been measuring, and are likely to be\r\nmeasuring for some time to come.\r\n\r\nMany and brilliant as were Maxwell's discoveries, not only in electricity,\r\nbut also in the theory of the nature of gases, and in molecular science\r\ngenerally, I can not help thinking that if one of them is more striking and\r\nmore full of future significance than the rest, it is the one I have just\r\nmentioned--the theory that light is an electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of this splendid generalization was caught in 1845, five\r\nand thirty years ago, by that prince of pure experimentalists, Michael\r\nFaraday. His reasons for suspecting some connection between electricity and\r\nlight are not clear to us--in fact, they could not have been clear to him;\r\nbut he seems to have felt a conviction that if he only tried long enough\r\nand sent all kinds of rays of light in all possible directions across\r\nelectric and magnetic fields in all sorts of media, he must ultimately\r\nhit upon something. Well, this is very nearly what he did. With a sublime\r\npatience and perseverance which remind one of the way Kepler hunted down\r\nguess after guess in a different field of research, Faraday combined\r\nelectricity, or magnetism, and light in all manner of ways, and at last he\r\nwas rewarded with a result. And a most out-of-the-way result it seemed.\r\nFirst, you have to get a most powerful magnet and very strongly excite it;\r\nthen you have to pierce its two poles with holes, in order that a beam of\r\nlight may travel from one to the other along the lines of force; then, as\r\nordinary light is no good, you must get a beam of plane polarized light,\r\nand send it between the poles. But still no result is obtained until,\r\nfinally, you interpose a piece of a rare and out-of-the-way material, which\r\nFaraday had himself discovered and made--a kind of glass which contains\r\nborate of lead, and which is very heavy, or dense, and which must be\r\nperfectly annealed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when all these arrangements are completed, what is seen is simply\r\nthis, that if an analyzer is arranged to stop the light and make the field\r\nquite dark before the magnet is excited, then directly the battery is\r\nconnected and the magnet called into action, a faint and barely perceptible\r\nbrightening of the field occurs, which will disappear if the analyzer be\r\nslightly rotated. [The experiment was then shown.] Now, no wonder that no\r\none understood this result. Faraday himself did not understand it at all.\r\nHe seems to have thought that the magnetic lines of force were rendered\r\nluminous, or that the light was magnetized; in fact, he was in a fog,\r\nand had no idea of its real significance. Nor had any one. Continental\r\nphilosophers experienced some difficulty and several failures before they\r\nwere able to repeat the experiment. It was, in fact, discovered too soon,\r\nand before the scientific world was ready to receive it, and it was\r\nreserved for Sir William Thomson briefly, but very clearly, to point\r\nout, and for Clerk-Maxwell more fully to develop, its most important\r\nconsequences. [The principle of the experiment was then illustrated by the\r\naid of a mechanical model.]\r\n\r\nThis is the fundamental experiment on which Clerk-Maxwell's theory of\r\nlight is based; but of late years many fresh facts and relations between\r\nelectricity and light have been discovered, and at the present time they\r\nare tumbling in in great numbers.\r\n\r\nIt was found by Faraday that many other transparent media besides heavy\r\nglass would show the phenomenon if placed between the poles, only in a less\r\ndegree; and the very important observation that air itself exhibits the\r\nsame phenomenon, though to an exceedingly small extent, has just been made\r\nby Kundt and Rontgen in Germany.\r\n\r\nDr. Kerr, of Glasgow, has extended the result to opaque bodies, and has\r\nshown that if light be passed through magnetized _iron_ its plane is\r\nrotated. The film of iron must be exceedingly thin, because of its opacity,\r\nand hence, though the intrinsic rotating power of iron is undoubtedly very\r\ngreat, the observed rotation is exceedingly small and difficult to observe;\r\nand it is only by a very remarkable patience and care and ingenuity that\r\nDr. Kerr has obtained his result. Mr. Fitzgerald, of Dublin, has examined\r\nthe question mathematically, and has shown that Maxwell's theory would have\r\nenabled Dr. Kerr's result to be predicted.\r\n\r\nAnother requirement of the theory is that bodies which are transparent\r\nto light must be insulators or non-conductors of electricity, and that\r\nconductors of electricity are necessarily opaque to light. Simple\r\nobservation amply confirms this; metals are the best conductors, and are\r\nthe most opaque bodies known. Insulators such as glass and crystals are\r\ntransparent whenever they are sufficiently homogeneous, and the very\r\nremarkable researches of Prof. Graham Bell in the last few months have\r\nshown that even _ebonite_, one of the most opaque insulators to ordinary\r\nvision, is certainly transparent to some kinds of radiation, and\r\ntransparent to no small degree.\r\n\r\n[The reason why transparent bodies must insulate, and why conductors must\r\nbe opaque, was here illustrated by mechanical models.]\r\n\r\nA further consequence of the theory is that the velocity of light in a\r\ntransparent medium will be affected by its electrical strain constant; in\r\nother words, that its refractive index will bear some close but not yet\r\nquite ascertained relation to its specific inductive capacity. Experiment\r\nhas partially confirmed this, but the confirmation is as yet very\r\nincomplete. But there are a number of results not predicted by theory, and\r\nwhose connection with the theory is not clearly made out. We have the fact\r\nthat light falling on the platinum electrode of a voltameter generates a\r\ncurrent, first observed, I think, by Sir W. R. Grove--at any rate, it is\r\nmentioned in his \"Correlation of Forces\"--extended by Becquerel and Robert\r\nSabine to other substances, and now being extended to fluorescent and other\r\nbodies by Prof. Minchin. And finally--for I must be brief--we have\r\nthe remarkable action of light on selenium. This fact was discovered\r\naccidentally by an assistant in the laboratory of Mr. Willoughby Smith, who\r\nnoticed that a piece of selenium conducted electricity very much better\r\nwhen light was falling upon it than when it was in the dark. The light of\r\na candle is sufficient, and instantaneously brings down the resistance to\r\nsomething like one-fifth of its original value.\r\n\r\nI could show you these effects, but there is not much to see; it is an\r\nintensely interesting phenomenon, but its external manifestation is not\r\nstriking--any more than Faraday's heavy glass experiment was.\r\n\r\nThis is the phenomenon which, as you know, has been utilized by Prof.\r\nGraham Bell in that most ingenious and striking invention, the photophone.\r\nBy the kindness of Prof. Silvanus Thompson, I have a few slides to show the\r\nprinciple of the invention, and Mr. Shelford Bidwell has been kind enough\r\nto lend me his home-made photophone, which answers exceedingly well for\r\nshort distances.\r\n\r\nI have now trespassed long enough upon your patience, but I must just\r\nallude to what may very likely be the next striking popular discovery; and\r\nthat is the transmission of light by electricity; I mean the transmission\r\nof such things as views and pictures by means of the electric wire. It has\r\nnot yet been done, but it seems already theoretically possible, and it may\r\nvery soon be practically accomplished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING ELECTRICAL RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last six years Dr. Warren de la Rue has been investigating,\r\nin conjunction with Dr. Hugo Muller, the various and highly interesting\r\nphenomena which accompany the electric discharge. From time to time the\r\nresults of their researches were communicated to the Royal Society, and\r\nappeared in its Proceedings. Early last year Dr. De la Rue being requested\r\nto bring the subject before the members of the Royal Institution, acceded\r\nto the pressing invitation of his colleagues and scientific friends.\r\nThe discourse, which was necessarily long postponed on account of the\r\npreparations that had to be made, was finally given on Friday, the 21st of\r\nJanuary, and was one of the most remarkable, from the elaborate nature of\r\nthe experiments, ever delivered in the theater of that deservedly famous\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great inconvenience of removing the battery from his\r\nlaboratory, Dr. de la Rue, despite the great expenditure, directed Mr. S.\r\nTisley to prepare, expressly for the lecture, a second series of 14,400\r\ncells, and fit it up in the basement of the Royal Institution. The\r\nconstruction of this new battery occupied Mr. Tisley a whole year, while\r\nthe charging of it extended over a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe \"de la Rue cell,\" if we may so call one of these elements, consists of\r\na zinc rod, the lower portion of which is embedded in a solid electrolyte,\r\nviz., chloride of silver, with which are connected two flattened silver\r\nwires to serve as electrodes. When these are united and the silver chloride\r\nmoistened, chemical action begins, and a weak but constant current is\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nThe electromotive force of such a cell is 1.03 volts, and a current\r\nequivalent to one volt passing through a resistance of one ohm was found to\r\ndecompose 0.00146 grain of water in one second. The battery is divided\r\ninto \"cabinets,\" which hold from 1,200 to 2,160 small elements each. This\r\nfacilitates removal, and also the detection of any fault that may occur.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1808 Sir Humphry Davy constructed his battery\r\nof 2,000 cells, and thus succeeded in exalting the tiny spark obtained in\r\nclosing the circuit into the luminous sheaf of the voltaic arc. He also\r\nobserved that the spark passed even when the poles were separated by a\r\ndistance varying from 1/40 to 1/30 of an inch. This appears to have been\r\nsubsequently forgotten, as we find later physicists questioning the\r\npossibility of the spark leaping over any interpolar distance. Mr. J.\r\nP. Gassiot, of Clapham, demonstrated the inaccuracy of this opinion by\r\nconstructing a battery of 3,000 Leclanché cells, which gave a spark of\r\n0.025 inch; a similar number of \"de la Rue\" cells gives an 0.0564 inch\r\nspark. This considerable increase in potential is chiefly due to better\r\ninsulation.\r\n\r\nThe great energy of this battery was illustrated by a variety of\r\nexperiments. Thus, a large condenser, specially constructed by Messrs.\r\nVarley, and having a capacity equal to that of 6,485 large Leyden jars,\r\nwas almost immediately charged by the current from 10,000 cells. Wires of\r\nvarious kinds, and from 9 inches to 29 inches in length, were instantly\r\nvolatilized by the passage of the electricity thus stored up. The current\r\ninduced in the secondary wire of a coil by the discharge of the condenser\r\nthrough the primary, was also sufficiently intense to deflagrate wires of\r\nconsiderable length and thickness.\r\n\r\nIt was with such power at his command that Dr. De la Rue proceeded to\r\ninvestigate several important electrical laws. He has found, for example,\r\nthat the positive discharge is more intermittent than the negative,\r\nthat the arc is always preceded by a streamer-like discharge, that its\r\ntemperature is about 16,000 deg., and its length at the ordinary pressure\r\nof the atmosphere, when taken between two points, varies as the square\r\nof the number of cells. Thus, with a battery of 1,000 cells, the arc was\r\n0.0051 inch, with 11,000 cells it increased to 0.62 inch. The same law was\r\nfound to hold when the discharge took place between a point and a disk; it\r\nfailed entirely, however, when the terminals were two disks.\r\n\r\nIt was also shown that the voltaic arc is not a phenomenon of conduction,\r\nbut is essentially a disruptive discharge, the intervals between the\r\npassage of two successive static sparks being the time required for the\r\nbattery to collect sufficient power to leap over the interposed resistance.\r\nThis was further confirmed by the introduction of a condenser, when the\r\nintervals were perceptibly larger.\r\n\r\nFaraday proved that the quantity of electricity necessary to produce a\r\nstrong flash of lightning would result from the decomposition of a single\r\ngrain of water, and Dr. de la Rue's experiments confirm this extraordinary\r\nstatement. He has calculated that this quantity of electricity would be\r\n5,000 times as great as the charge of his large condenser, and that a\r\nlightning flash a mile long would require the potential of 3,500,000 cells,\r\nthat is to say, of 243 of his powerful batteries.\r\n\r\nIn experimenting with \"vacuum\" tubes, he has found that the discharge is\r\nalso invariably disruptive. This is an important point, as many physicists\r\nspeak and write of the phenomenon as one of conduction. Air, in every\r\ndegree of tenuity, refuses to act as a conductor of electricity. These\r\nexperiments show that the resistance of gaseous media diminishes with the\r\npressure only up to a certain point, beyond which it rapidly increases.\r\nThus, in the case of hydrogen, it diminishes up to 0.642 mm., 845\r\nmillionths; it then rises as the exhaustion proceeds, and at 0.00065 mm.,\r\n8.6 millionths, it requires as high a potential as at 21.7 mm., 28.553\r\nmillionths. At 0.00137 mm., 1.8 millionth, the current from 11,000 cells\r\nwould not pass through a tube for which 430 cells sufficed at the pressure\r\nof minimum resistance. At a pressure of 0.0055 mm., 0.066 millionth, the\r\nhighest exhaust obtained in any of the experiments, even a one-inch spark\r\nfrom an induction coil refused to pass. It was also ascertained that there\r\nis neither condensacian nor dilatation of the gas in contact with the\r\nterminals prior to the passage of the discharge.\r\n\r\nThese researches naturally led to some speculation about the conditions\r\nunder which auroral phenomena may occur. Observers have variously stated\r\nthe height at which the aurora borealis attains its greatest brilliancy\r\nas ranging between 124 and 281 miles. Dr. de la Rue's conclusions fix\r\nthe upper limit at 124 miles, and that of maximum display at 37 miles,\r\nadmitting also that the aurora may sometimes occur at an altitude of a few\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe aurora was beautifully illustrated by a very large tube, in which the\r\ntheoretical pressure was carefully maintained, the characteristic roseate\r\ntinge being readily produced and maintained.\r\n\r\nIn studying the stratifications observed in vacuum tubes, Dr. de la Rue\r\nfinds that they originate at the positive pole, and that their steadiness\r\nmay be regulated by the resistance in circuit, and that even when the least\r\ntremor cannot be detected by the eye, they are still produced by rapid\r\npulsations which may be as frequent as ten millions per second.\r\n\r\nDr. de la Rue concluded his interesting discourse by exhibiting some of the\r\nfinest tubes of his numerous and unsurpassed collection.--_Engineering_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoulomb's torsion balance has been adapted by M. Baille to the measurement\r\nof low electromotive forces in a very successful manner, and has been found\r\npreferable by him to the delicate electrometers of Sir W. Thomson. It\r\nis necessary to guard it from disturbances due to extraneous electric\r\ninfluences and the trembling of the ground. These can be eliminated\r\ncompletely by encircling the instrument in a metal case connected to\r\nearth, and mounting it on solid pillars in a still place. Heat also has a\r\ndisturbing effect, and makes itself felt in the torsion of the fiber and\r\nthe cage surrounding the lever. These effects are warded off by inclosing\r\nthe instrument in a non-conducting jacket of wood shavings.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of M. Baille consists of an annealed silver torsion wire of\r\n2.70 meters long, and a lever 0.50 meter long, carrying at each extremity\r\na ball of copper, gilded, and three centimeters in diameter. Similar balls\r\nare fixed at the corners of a square 20.5 meters in the side, and connected\r\nin diagonal pairs by fine wire. The lever placed at equal distances from\r\nthe fixed balls communicates, by the medium of the torsion wire, with the\r\npositive pole of a battery, P, the other pole being to earth.\r\n\r\nOwing to some unaccountable variations in the change of the lever or\r\nneedle, M. Baille was obliged to measure the change at each observation.\r\nThis was done by joining the + pole of the battery to the needle, and one\r\npair of the fixed balls, and observing the deflection; then the deflection\r\nproduced by the other balls was observed. This operation was repeated\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\nThe battery, X, to be measured consisted of ten similar elements, and one\r\npole of it was connected to the fixed balls, while the other pole was\r\nconnected to the earth. The needle, of course, remained in contact with the\r\n+ pole of the charging battery, P.\r\n\r\nThe deflections were read from a clear glass scale, placed at a distance\r\nof 3.30 meters from the needle, and the results worked out from Coulomb's\r\nstatic formula,\r\n\r\nC a = (4 m m')/d², with\r\n\r\n          ______________\r\n         / sum((p/g) r²)\r\n  O =   /  -------------\r\n      \\/        C\r\n\r\n[TEX: O = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum \\frac{p}{g} r^2}{C}}]\r\n\r\nIn M.

They are expressed\r\nin units of electricity, the unit being the quantity of electricity which,\r\nacting upon a similar unit at a distance of one centimeter, produces a\r\nrepulsion equal to one gramme:\r\n\r\nVolta pile                                         0.03415 open circuit.\r\nZinc, sulphate of copper, copper                   0.02997     \"\r\nZinc, acidulated water, copper, sulphate of copper 0.03709     \"\r\nZinc, salt water, carbon peroxide of manganese     0.05282     \"\r\nZinc, salt water, platinum, chloride of platinum   0.05027     \"\r\nZinc, acidulated water, carbon nitric acid         0.06285     \"\r\n\r\nThese results were obtained just upon charging the batteries, and are,\r\ntherefore, slightly higher than the potentials given after the batteries\r\nbecame older. The sulphate of copper cells kept about their maximum value\r\nlongest, but they showed variations of about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONY BY THERMIC CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in telephonic arrangements, based upon the principle of magnetic\r\ninduction, a relatively considerable expenditure of force is required in\r\norder to set the tightly stretched membrane in vibration, in the so-called\r\ncarbon telephones only a very feeble impulse is required to produce the\r\ndifferences in the current necessary for the transmission of sounds. In\r\norder to produce relatively strong currents, even in case of sound-action\r\nof a minimum strength, Franz Kröttlinger, of Vienna, has made an\r\ninteresting experiment to use thermo electric currents for the transmission\r\nof sound to a distance. The apparatus which he has constructed is\r\nexceedingly simple. A current of hot air flowing from below upward is\r\ndeflected more or less from its direction by the human voice. By its action\r\nan adjacent thermo-battery is excited, whose current passes through the\r\nspiral of an ordinary telephone, which serves as the receiving instrument.\r\nAs a source of heat the inventor uses a common stearine candle, the flame\r\nof which is kept at one and the same level by means of a spring similar to\r\nthose used in carriage lamps. On one side of the candle is a sheet metal\r\nvoice funnel fixed upon a support, its mouth being covered with a movable\r\nsliding disk, fitted with a suitable number of small apertures. On the\r\nother side a similar support holds a funnel-shaped thermo-battery. The\r\nsingle bars of metal forming this battery are very thin, and of such a\r\nshape that they may cool as quickly as possible. Both the speaking-funnel\r\nand the battery can be made to approach, at will, to the stream of warm air\r\nrising up from the flame. The entire apparatus is inclosed in a tin case\r\nin such a manner that only the aperture of the voice-funnel and the polar\r\nclamps for securing the conducting wires appear on the outside. The inside\r\nof the case is suitably stayed to prevent vibration. On speaking into the\r\nmouth-piece of the funnel, the sound-waves occasion undulations in the\r\ncolumn of hot air which are communicated to the thermo-battery, and in this\r\nmanner corresponding differences are produced in the currents in the wires\r\nleading to the receiving instrument.--_Oesterreichische-Ungarische Post._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELECTROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nBy MONS. SENLECQ, of Ardres.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, which is intended to transmit to a distance through a\r\ntelegraphic wire pictures taken on the plate of a camera, was invented in\r\nthe early part of 1877 by M. Senlecq, of Ardres. A description of the first\r\nspecification submitted by M. Senlecq to M. du Moncel, member of the\r\nParis Academy of Sciences, appeared in all the continental and American\r\nscientific journals. Since then the apparatus has everywhere occupied the\r\nattention of prominent electricians, who have striven to improve on it.\r\nAmong these we may mention MM. Ayrton, Perry, Sawyer (of New York),\r\nSargent (of Philadelphia), Brown (of London), Carey (of Boston), Tighe (of\r\nPittsburg), and Graham Bell himself. Some experimenters have used many\r\nwires, bound together cable-wise, others one wire only. The result has\r\nbeen, on the one hand, confusion of conductors beyond a certain distance,\r\nwith the absolute impossibility of obtaining perfect insulation; and,\r\non the other hand, an utter want of synchronism. The unequal and slow\r\nsensitiveness of the selenium likewise obstructed the proper working of the\r\napparatus. Now, without a relative simplicity in the arrangement of the\r\nconducting wires intended to convey to a distance the electric current with\r\nits variations of intensity, without a perfect and rapid synchronism\r\nacting concurrently with the luminous impressions, so as to insure the\r\nsimultaneous action of transmitter and receiver, without, in fine, an\r\nincreased sensitiveness in the selenium, the idea of the telectroscope\r\ncould not be realized. M. Senlecq has fortunately surmounted most of these\r\nmain obstacles, and we give to-day a description of the latest apparatus he\r\nhas contrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMITTER.\r\n\r\nA brass plate, A, whereon the rays of light impinge inside a camera, in\r\ntheir various forms and colors, from the external objects placed before the\r\nlens, the said plate being coated with selenium on the side intended to\r\nface the dark portion of the camera This brass plate has its entire surface\r\nperforated with small holes as near to one another as practicable. These\r\nholes are filled with selenium, heated, and then cooled very slowly, so as\r\nto obtain the maximum sensitiveness. A small brass wire passes through the\r\nselenium in each hole, without, however, touching the plate, on to the\r\nrectangular and vertical ebonite plate, B, Fig. 1, from under this plate\r\nat point, C. Thus, every wire passing through plate, A, has its point\r\nof contact above the plate, B, lengthwise. With this view the wires are\r\nclustered together when leaving the camera, and thence stretch to their\r\ncorresponding points of contact on plate, B, along line, C C. The surface\r\nof brass, A, is in permanent contact with the positive pole of the battery\r\n(selenium). On each side of plate, B, are let in two brass rails, D and E,\r\nwhereon the slide hereinafter described works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nRail, E, communicates with the line wire intended to conduct the various\r\nlight and shade vibrations. Rail, D, is connected with the battery wire.\r\nAlong F are a number of points of contact corresponding with those along\r\nC C. These contacts help to work the apparatus, and to insure the perfect\r\nisochronism of the transmitter and receiver. These points of contact,\r\nthough insulated one from the other on the surface of the plate, are all\r\nconnected underneath with a wire coming from the positive pole of a special\r\nbattery. This apparatus requires two batteries, as, in fact, do all\r\nautographic telegraphs--one for sending the current through the selenium,\r\nand one for working the receiver, etc. The different features of this\r\nimportant plate may, therefore, be summed up thus:\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.\r\n\r\nD. Brass rail, grooved and connected with the line wire working the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nF. Contacts connected underneath with a wire permanently connected with\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nC.

Brass rail, grooved, etc., like D.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVER.\r\n\r\nA small slide, Fig. 2, having at one of its angles a very narrow piece of\r\nbrass, separated in the middle by an insulating surface, used for setting\r\nthe apparatus in rapid motion. This small slide has at the points, D D, a\r\nsmall groove fitting into the brass rails of plate, B, Fig. 1, whereby it\r\ncan keep parallel on the two brass rails, D and E. Its insulator, B, Fig.\r\n2, corresponds to the insulating interval between F and C, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nA, Fig. 3, circular disk, suspended vertically (made of ebonite or other\r\ninsulating material). This disk is fixed. All round the inside of its\r\ncircumference are contacts, connected underneath with the corresponding\r\nwires of the receiving apparatus. The wires coming from the seleniumized\r\nplate correspond symmetrically, one after the other, with the contacts of\r\ntransmitter. They are connected in the like order with those of disk, A,\r\nand with those of receiver, so that the wire bearing the No. 5 from the\r\nselenium will correspond identically with like contact No. 5 of receiver.\r\n\r\nD, Fig. 4, gutta percha or vulcanite insulating plate, through which pass\r\nnumerous very fine platinum wires, each corresponding at its point of\r\ncontact with those on the circular disk, A.\r\n\r\nThe receptive plate must be smaller than the plate whereon the light\r\nimpinges. The design being thus reduced will be the more perfect from the\r\ndots formed by the passing currents being closer together.\r\n\r\nB, zinc or iron or brass plate connected to earth. It comes in contact with\r\nchemically prepared paper, C, where the impression is to take place. It\r\ncontributes to the impression by its contact with the chemically prepared\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nIn E, Fig. 3, at the center of the above described fixed plate is a\r\nmetallic axis with small handle. On this axis revolves brass wheel, F, Fig.\r\n5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nOn handle, E, presses continuously the spring, H, Fig. 3, bringing the\r\ncurrent coming from the selenium line. The cogged wheel in Fig. 5 has at a\r\ncertain point of its circumference the sliding spring, O, Fig. 5, intended\r\nto slide as the wheel revolves over the different contacts of disk, A, Fig.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThis cogged wheel, Fig. 5, is turned, as in the dial telegraphs, by a rod\r\nworking in and out under the successive movements of the electro-magnet,\r\nH, and of the counter spring. By means of this rod (which must be of a\r\nnon-metallic material, so as not to divert the motive current), and of an\r\nelbow lever, this alternating movement is transmitted to a catch, G, which\r\nworks up and down between the cogs, and answers the same purpose as the\r\nordinary clock anchor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nThis cogged wheel is worked by clockwork inclosed between two disks, and\r\nwould rotate continuously were it not for the catch, G, working in and out\r\nof the cogs. Through this catch, G, the wheel is dependent on the movement\r\nof electro-magnet. This cogged wheel is a double one, consisting of two\r\nwheels coupled together, exactly similar one with the other, and so fixed\r\nthat the cogs of the one correspond with the void between the cogs of the\r\nothers. As the catch, G, moves down it frees a cog in first wheel, and both\r\nwheels begin to turn, but the second wheel is immediately checked by catch,\r\nG, and the movement ceases. A catch again works the two wheels, turn half a\r\ncog, and so on. Each wheel contains as many cogs as there are contacts on\r\ntransmitter disk, consequently as many as on circular disk, A, Fig. 3, and\r\non brass disk within camera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nHaving now described the several parts of the apparatus, let us see how it\r\nworks. All the contacts correspond one with the other, both on the side of\r\nselenium current and that of the motive current. Let us suppose that the\r\nslide of transmitter is on contact No. 10 for instance; the selenium\r\ncurrent starting from No. 10 reaches contact 10 of rectangular transmitter,\r\nhalf the slide bearing on this point, as also on the parallel rail,\r\ncommunicates the current to said rail, thence to line, from the line to\r\naxis of cogged wheel, from axis to contact 10 of circular fixed disk,\r\nand thence to contact 10 of receiver. At each selenium contact of the\r\nrectangular disk there is a corresponding contact to the battery and\r\nelectro-magnet. Now, on reaching contact 10 the intermission of the current\r\nhas turned the wheel 10 cogs, and so brought the small contact, O, Fig. 5,\r\non No. 10 of the fixed circular disk.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the synchronism of the apparatus could not be obtained in\r\na more simple and complete mode--the rectangular transmitter being placed\r\nvertically, and the slide being of a certain weight to its fall from the\r\nfirst point of contact sufficient to carry it rapidly over the whole length\r\nof this transmitter.\r\n\r\nThe picture is, therefore, reproduced almost instantaneously; indeed, by\r\nusing platinum wires on the receiver connected with the negative pole, by\r\nthe incandescence of these wires according to the different degrees of\r\nelectricity we can obtain a picture, of a fugitive kind, it is true, but\r\nyet so vivid that the impression on the retina does not fade during the\r\nrelatively very brief space of time the slide occupies in traveling over\r\nall the contacts. A Ruhmkorff coil may also be employed for obtaining\r\nsparks in proportion to the current emitted. The apparatus is regulated\r\nin precisely the same way as dial telegraphs, starting always from first\r\ncontact. The slide should, therefore, never be removed from the rectangular\r\ndisk, whereon it is held by the grooves in the brass rails, into which it\r\nfits with but slight friction, without communicating any current to the\r\nline wires when not placed on points of contact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT No. 274, page 4368.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSMITTING POWER TO A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper lately read before the Institution of Mechanical\r\nEngineers.]\r\n\r\nBy ARTHUR ACHARD, of Geneva.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut allowing that the figure of 22 H. P., assumed for this power (the\r\nresult in calculating the work with compressed air being 19 H. P.) may be\r\nsomewhat incorrect, it is unlikely that this error can be so large that its\r\ncorrection could reduce the efficiency below 80 per cent. Messrs. Sautter\r\nand Lemonnier, who construct a number of compressors, on being consulted\r\nby the author, have written to say that they always confined themselves in\r\nestimating the power stored in the compressed air, and had never measured\r\nthe gross power expended. Compressed air in passing along the pipe, assumed\r\nto be horizontal, which conveys it from the place of production to the\r\nplace where it is to be used, experiences by friction a diminution of\r\npressure, which represents a reduction in the mechanical power stored up,\r\nand consequently a loss of efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe loss of pressure in question can only be calculated conveniently on the\r\nhypothesis that it is very small, and the general formula,\r\n\r\n  p1 - p     4L\r\n  ------- = ---- f(u),\r\n  [Delta]    D\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 - p}{\\Delta} = \\frac{4L}{D}f(u)]\r\n\r\nis employed for the purpose, where D is the diameter of the pipe, assumed\r\nto be uniform, L the length of the pipe, p1 the pressure at the entrance, p\r\nthe pressure at the farther end, u the velocity at which the compressed air\r\ntravels, [Delta] its specific weight, and f(u) the friction per unit of\r\nlength. In proportion as the air loses pressure its speed increases, while\r\nits specific weight diminishes; but the variations in pressure are assumed\r\nto be so small that u and [Delta] may be considered constant. As regards\r\nthe quantity f(u), or the friction per unit of length, the natural law\r\nwhich regulates it is not known, audit can only be expressed by some\r\nempirical formula, which, while according sufficiently nearly with the\r\nfacts, is suited for calculation. For this purpose the binomial formula, au\r\n+ bu², or the simple formula, b1 u², is generally adopted; a b and b1 being\r\ncoefficients deduced from experiment. The values, however, which are to\r\nbe given to these coefficients are not constant, for they vary with the\r\ndiameter of the pipe, and in particular, contrary to formerly received\r\nideas, they vary according to its internal surface. The uncertainty in this\r\nrespect is so great that it is not worth while, with a view to accuracy, to\r\nrelinquish the great convenience which the simple formula, b1 u², offers.\r\nIt would be better from this point of view to endeavor, as has been\r\nsuggested, to render this formula more exact by the substitution of a\r\nfractional power in the place of the square, rather than to go through\r\nthe long calculations necessitated by the use of the binomial au + bu².\r\nAccordingly, making use of the formula b1 u², the above equation becomes,\r\n\r\n  p1 - p     4L\r\n  ------- = ---- b1 u²;\r\n  [Delta]    D\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 - p}{\\Delta} = \\frac{4L}{D} b_1 u^2]\r\n\r\nor, introducing the discharge per second, Q, which is the usual figure\r\nsupplied, and which is connected with the velocity by the relation, Q =\r\n([pi] D² u)/4, we have\r\n\r\n  p1 - p      64 b1\r\n  ------- = --------- L Q².\r\n  [Delta]   [pi]² D^5\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 - p}{\\Delta} = \\frac{64 b_1}{\\pi^2 D^5} L Q^2]\r\n\r\nGenerally the pressure, p1, at the entrance is known, and the pressure, p,\r\nhas to be found; it is then from p1 that the values of Q and [Delta] are\r\ncalculated. In experiments where p1 and p are measured directly, in order\r\nto arrive at the value of the coefficient b1, Q and [Delta] would be\r\ncalculated for the mean pressure ½(p1 + p). The values given to the\r\ncoefficient b1 vary considerably, because, as stated above, it varies with\r\nthe diameter, and also with the nature of the material of the pipe. It\r\nis generally admitted that it is independent of the pressure, and it is\r\nprobable that within certain limits of pressure this hypothesis is in\r\naccordance with the truth.\r\n\r\nD'Aubuisson gives for this case, in his _Traité d'Hydraulique_, a rather\r\ncomplicated formula, containing a constant deduced from experiment, whose\r\nvalue, according to a calculation made by the author, is approximately b1 =\r\n0.0003. This constant was determined by taking the mean of experiments made\r\nwith tin tubes of 0.0235 meter (15/16 in.), 0.05 meter (2 in.), and 0.10\r\nmeter (4 in.) diameter; and it was erroneously assumed that it was correct\r\nfor all diameters and all substances.\r\n\r\nM. Arson, engineer to the Paris Gas Company, published in 1867, in the\r\n_Mémoires de la Société des Ingénieurs Civils de France_, the results of\r\nsome experiments on the loss of pressure in gas when passing through pipes.\r\nHe employed cast-iron pipes of the ordinary type. He has represented the\r\nresults of his experiments by the binomial formula, au + bu², and gives\r\nvalues for the coefficients a and b, which diminish with an increase in\r\ndiameter, but would indicate greater losses of pressure than D'Aubuisson's\r\nformula. M. Deviller, in his _Rapport sur les travaux de percement du\r\ntunnel sous les Alpes_, states that the losses of pressure observed in the\r\nair pipe at the Mont Cenis Tunnel confirm the correctness of D'Aubuisson's\r\nformula; but his reasoning applies to too complicated a formula to be\r\nabsolutely convincing.\r\n\r\nQuite recently M. E. Stockalper, engineer-in-chief at the northern end of\r\nthe St. Gothard Tunnel, has made some experiments on the air conduit of\r\nthis tunnel, the results of which he has kindly furnished to the author.\r\nThese lead to values for the coefficient b1 appreciably less than that\r\nwhich is contained implicitly in D'Aubuisson's formula. As he experimented\r\non a rising pipe, it is necessary to introduce into the formula the\r\ndifference of level, h, between the two ends; it then becomes\r\n\r\n  p1 - p      64 b1\r\n  ------- = --------- L Q² + h.\r\n  [Delta]   [pi]² D^5\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 - p}{\\Delta} = \\frac{64 b_1}{\\pi^2 D^5} L Q^2 + h]\r\n\r\nThe following are the details of the experiments: First series of\r\nexperiments: Conduit consisting of cast or wrought iron pipes, joined by\r\nmeans of flanges, bolts, and gutta percha rings. D = 0.20 m. (8 in.); L =\r\n4,600 m. (15,100 ft,); h= 26.77 m. (87 ft. 10 in.). 1st experiment: Q =\r\n0.1860 cubic meter (6.57 cubic feet), at a pressure of ½(p1 + p), and a\r\ntemperature of 22° Cent. (72° Fahr.); p1 = 5.60 atm., p =5.24 atm. Hence p1\r\n- p = 0.36 atm.= 0.36 x 10,334 kilogrammes per square meter (2.116 lb. per\r\nsquare foot), whence we obtain b1=0.0001697. D'Aubuisson's formula would\r\nhave given p1 - p = 0.626 atm.; and M. Arson's would have given p1 - p =\r\n0.9316 atm. 2d experiment: Q = 0.1566 cubic meter (5.53 cubic feet), at a\r\npressure of ½(p1 + p), and a temperature of 22° Cent. (72° Fahr.); p1\r\n= 4.35 atm., p = 4.13 atm. Hence p1 - p = 0.22 atm. = 0.22 X 10,334\r\nkilogrammes per square meter (2,116 lb. per square foot); whence we obtain\r\nb1 = 0.0001816. D'Aubuisson's formula would have given p1 - p = 0.347 atm;\r\nand M. Arson's would have given p1 - p = 0.5382 atm. 3d experiment: Q =\r\n0.1495 cubic meter (5.28 cubic feet) at a pressure of ½(p1 + p) and a\r\ntemperature 22° Cent. (72° Fahr.); p1 = 3.84 atm., p = 3.65 atm. Hence p1 -\r\np = 0.19 atm. = 0.19 X 10,334 kilogrammes per square meter (2.116 lb. per\r\nsquare foot); whence we obtain B1 = 0.0001966. D'Aubuisson's formula would\r\nhave given p1 - p = 0.284 atm., and M. Arson's would have given p1 - p =\r\n0.4329 atm. Second series of experiments: Conduit composed of wrought-iron\r\npipes, with joints as in the first experiments. D = 0.15 meter (6 in.), L\r\n- 0.522 meters (1,712 ft.), h = 3.04 meters (10 ft.) 1st experiments: Q =\r\n0.2005 cubic meter (7.08 cubic feet), at a pressure of ½(p1 + p), and a\r\ntemperature of 26.5° Cent. (80° Fahr.); p1 = 5.24 atm., p = 5.00 atm. Hence\r\np1 - p = 0.24 atm. =0.24 x 10,334 kilogrammes per square meter (2,116 lb.\r\nper square foot); whence we obtain b1 = 0.3002275. 2nd experiment: Q =\r\n0.1586 cubic meter (5.6 cubic feet), at a pressure of ½(p1 + p), and a\r\ntemperature of 26.5° Cent. (80° Fahr.); p1 = 3.650 atm., p = 3.545 atm.\r\nHence p1 - p = 0.105 atm. = 0.105 x 10,334 kilogrammes per square meter\r\n(2,116 lb. per square foot); whence we obtain b1 = 0.0002255. It is clear\r\nthat these experiments give very small values for the coefficient. The\r\ndivergence from the results which D'Aubuisson's formula would give is due\r\nto the fact that his formula was determined with very small pipes. It is\r\nprobable that the coefficients corresponding to diameters of 0.15 meter\r\n(6 in.) and 0.20 meter (8 in.) for a substance as smooth as tin, would be\r\nstill smaller respectively than the figures obtained above.\r\n\r\nThe divergence from the results obtained by M. Arson's formula does not\r\narise from a difference in size, as this is taken into account. The author\r\nconsiders that it may be attributed to the fact that the pipes for the St.\r\nGothard Tunnel were cast with much greater care than ordinary pipes, which\r\nrendered their surface smoother, and also to the fact that flanged joints\r\nproduce much less irregularity in the internal surface than the ordinary\r\nspigot and faucet joints.\r\n\r\nLastly, the difference in the methods of observation and the errors which\r\nbelong to them, must be taken into account. M. Stockalper, who experimented\r\non great pressures, used metallic gauges, which are instruments on whose\r\nsensibility and correctness complete reliance cannot be placed; and\r\nmoreover the standard manometer with which they were compared was one of\r\nthe same kind. The author is not of opinion that the divergence is owing to\r\nthe fact that M. Stockalper made his observations on an air conduit, where\r\nthe pressure was much higher than in gas pipes. Indeed, it may be assumed\r\nthat gases and liquids act in the same manner; and, as will be [1]\r\nexplained later on, there is reason to believe that with the latter a rise\r\nof pressure increases the losses of pressure instead of diminishing them.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: corrected from 'as will we explained']\r\n\r\nAll the pipes for supplying compressed air in tunnels and in headings of\r\nmines are left uncovered, and have flanged joints; which are advantages not\r\nmerely as regards prevention of leakage, but also for facility of laying\r\nand of inspection. If a compressed air pipe had to be buried in the ground\r\nthe flanged joint would lose a part of its advantages; but, nevertheless,\r\nthe author considers that it would still be preferable to the ordinary\r\njoint.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to refer to the motors fed with the compressed air.\r\nThis subject is still in its infancy from a practical point of view. In\r\nproportion as the air becomes hot by compression, so it cools by expansion,\r\nif the vessel containing it is impermeable to heat. Under these conditions\r\nit gives out in expanding a power appreciably less than if it retained its\r\noriginal temperature; besides which the fall of temperature may impede the\r\nworking of the machine by freezing the vapor of water contained in the air.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to utilize to the utmost the force stored up in the\r\ncompressed air it is necessary to endeavor to supply heat to the air during\r\nexpansion so as to keep its temperature constant. It would be possible\r\nto attain this object by the same means which prevent heating from\r\ncompression, namely, by the circulation and injection of water. It would\r\nperhaps be necessary to employ a little larger quantity of water for\r\ninjection, as the water, instead of acting by virtue both of its heat of\r\nvaporization and of its specific heat, can in this case act only by virtue\r\nof the latter. These methods might be employed without difficulty for air\r\nmachines of some size. It would be more difficult to apply them to small\r\nhousehold machines, in which simplicity is an essential element; and we\r\nmust rest satisfied with imperfect methods, such as proximity to a stove,\r\nor the immersion of the cylinder in a tank of water. Consequently loss of\r\npower by cooling and by incomplete expansion cannot be avoided. The only\r\nway to diminish the relative amount of this loss is to employ compressed\r\nair at a pressure not exceeding three or four atmospheres.\r\n\r\nThe only real practical advance made in this matter is M. Mékarski's\r\ncompressed air engine for tramways. In this engine the air is made to pass\r\nthrough a small boiler containing water at a temperature of about 120°\r\nCent. (248° Fahr.), before entering the cylinder of the engine. It must\r\nbe observed that in order to reduce the size of the reservoirs, which\r\nare carried on the locomotive, the air inside them must be very highly\r\ncompressed; and that in going from the reservoir into the cylinder it\r\npasses through a reducing valve or expander, which keeps the pressure of\r\nadmission at a definite figure, so that the locomotive can continue working\r\nso long as the supply of air contained in the reservoir has not come down\r\nto this limiting pressure. The air does not pass the expander until after\r\nit has gone through the boiler already mentioned. Therefore, if the\r\ntemperature which it assumes in the boiler is 100° Cent. (212° Fahr.), and\r\nif the limiting pressure is 5 atm., the gas which enters the engine will be\r\na mixture of air and water vapor at 100° Cent.; and of its total pressure\r\nthe vapor of water will contribute I atm. and the air 4 atm. Thus this\r\ncontrivance, by a small expenditure of fuel, enables the air to act\r\nexpansively without injurious cooling, and even reduces the consumption of\r\ncompressed air to an extent which compensates for part of the loss of power\r\narising from the preliminary expansion which the air experiences before its\r\nadmission into the engine. It is clear that this same contrivance, or what\r\namounts to the same thing, a direct injection of steam, at a sufficient\r\npressure, for the purpose of maintaining the expanding air at a constant\r\ntemperature, might be tried in a fixed engine worked by compressed air with\r\nsome chance of success.\r\n\r\nWhatever method is adopted it would be advantageous that the losses of\r\npressure in the pipes connecting the compressors with the motors should be\r\nreduced as much as possible, for in this case that loss would represent\r\na loss of efficiency. If, on the other hand, owing to defective means of\r\nreheating, it is necessary to remain satisfied with a small amount of\r\nexpansion, the loss of pressure in the pipe is unimportant, and has only\r\nthe effect of transferring the limited expansion to a point a little lower\r\non the scale of pressures. If W is the net disposable force on the shaft\r\nof the engine which works the compressor, v1 the volume of air at the\r\ncompressor, p1. given by the compressor, and at the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding air, and p0 the atmospheric pressure, the efficiency of the\r\ncompressor, assuming the air to expand according to Boyle's law, is given\r\nby the well-known formula--\r\n\r\n  p1 v1 log (p1 / p0)\r\n  -------------------.\r\n          W\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 v_1 \\log \\frac{p_1}{p_0}}{W}]\r\n\r\nLet p2 be the value to which the pressure is reduced by the loss of\r\npressure at the end of the conduit, and v2 the volume which the air\r\noccupies at this pressure and at the same temperature; the force stored\r\nup in the air at the end of its course through the conduit is p2 v2\r\nlog(p2/p0); consequently, the efficiency of the conduit is\r\n\r\n  p2 v2 log(p2/p0)\r\n  ----------------\r\n  p1 v1 log(p1/p0)\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_2 v_2 \\log\\frac{p_2}{p_0}}{p_2 v_2 \\log\\frac{p_2}{p_0}}]\r\n\r\na fraction that may be reduced to the simple form\r\n\r\n  log(p2/p0)\r\n  ----------,\r\n  log(p1/p0)\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{\\log\\frac{p_2}{p_0}}{\\log\\frac{p_2}{p_0}}]\r\n\r\nif there is no leakage during the passage of the air, because in that cause\r\np2 v2 = p1 v1. Lastly, if W1 is the net disposable force on the shaft of\r\nthe compressed air motor, the efficiency of this engine will be,\r\n\r\n        W1\r\n  ----------------\r\n  p2 v2 log(p2/p0)\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{W_1}{p_2 v_2 \\log \\frac{p_2}{p_0}}]\r\n\r\nand the product of these three partial efficiencies is equal to W1/W, the\r\ngeneral efficiency of the transmission.\r\n\r\nIII. _Transmission by Pressure Water_.--As transmission of power by\r\ncompressed air has been specially applied to the driving of tunnels, so\r\ntransmission by pressure water has been specially resorted to for lifting\r\nheavy loads, or for work of a similar nature, such as the operations\r\nconnected with the manufacture of Bessemer steel or of cast-iron pipes.\r\nThe author does not propose to treat of transmissions established for this\r\nspecial purpose, and depending on the use of accumulators at high pressure,\r\nas he has no fresh matter to impart on this subject, and as he believes\r\nthat the remarkable invention of Sir William Armstrong was described for\r\nthe first time, in the \"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical\r\nEngineers.\" His object is to refer to transmissions applicable to general\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of power by water may occur in another form. The motive\r\nforce to be transmitted may be employed for working pumps which raise the\r\nwater, not to a fictitious height in an accumulator, but to a real height\r\nin a reservoir, with a channel from this reservoir to distribute the water\r\nso raised among several motors arranged for utilizing the pressure. The\r\nauthor is not aware that works have been carried out for this purpose.\r\nHowever, in many towns a part of the water from the public mains serves to\r\nsupply small motors--consequently, if the water, instead of being brought\r\nby a natural fall, has been previously lifted artificially, it might be\r\nsaid that a transmission of power is here grafted on to the ordinary\r\ndistribution of water.\r\n\r\nUnless a positive or negative force of gravity is introduced into the\r\nproblem, independently of the force to be transmitted, the receivers of\r\nthe water pressure must be assumed to be at the same level as the forcing\r\npumps, or more correctly, the water discharged from the receivers to be at\r\nthe same level as the surface of the water from which the pumps draw their\r\nsupply. In this case the general efficiency of transmission is the product\r\nof three partial efficiencies, which correspond exactly to those mentioned\r\nwith regard to compressed air. The height of lift, contained in the\r\nnumerator of the fraction which expresses the efficiency of the pumps, is\r\nnot to be taken as the difference in level between the surface of the water\r\nin the reservoir and the surface of the water whence the pumps draw their\r\nsupply; but as this difference in level, plus the loss of pressure in the\r\nsuction pipe, which is usually very short, and plus the loss in the channel\r\nto the reservoir, which may be very long. A similar loss of initial\r\npressure affects the efficiency of the discharge channel. The reservoir, if\r\nof sufficient capacity, may become an important store of power, while the\r\ncompressed air reservoir can only do so to a very limited extent.\r\n\r\nOmitting the subject of the pumps, and passing on at once to the discharge\r\nmain, the author may first point out that the distinction between the\r\nascending and descending mains of the system is of no importance, for two\r\nreasons: first, that nothing prevents the motors being supplied direct from\r\nthe first alone; and second, that the one is not always distinct from the\r\nother. In fact, the reservoir may be connected by a single branch pipe with\r\nthe system which goes from the pumps to the motors; it may even be placed\r\nat the extreme end of this system beyond the motors, provided always that\r\nthe supply pipe is taken into it at the bottom. The same formula may be\r\nadopted for the loss of initial pressure in water pipes as for compressed\r\nair pipes, viz.,\r\n\r\n  p1 - p      64 b1\r\n  ------- = --------- L Q² ± h;\r\n  [Delta]   [pi]² D^5\r\n\r\n[TEX: \\frac{p_1 - p}{\\Delta} = \\frac{64 b_1}{\\pi^2 D^5} L Q^2 \\pm h]\r\n\r\nh being the difference of level between the two ends of the portion of\r\nconduit of length, L, and the sign + or - being used according as the\r\nconduit rises or falls. The specific weight, [delta], is constant, and the\r\nquotients, p1/[delta] and p/[delta], represent the heights, z and z1, to\r\nwhich the water could rise above the pipes, in vertical tubes branching\r\nfrom it, at the beginning and end of the transit. The values assigned to\r\nthe coefficient b1 in France, are those determined by D'Arcy. For new\r\ncast-iron pipes he gives b1 - 0.0002535 + 1/D 0.000000647; and recommends\r\nthat this value should be doubled, to allow for the rust and incrustation\r\nwhich more or less form inside the pipes during use. The determination of\r\nthis coefficient has been made from experiments where the pressure has\r\nnot exceeded four atmospheres; within these limits the value of the\r\ncoefficient, as is generally admitted, is independent of the pressure. The\r\nexperiments made by M. Barret, on the pressure pipes of the accumulator at\r\nthe Marseilles docks, seem to indicate that the loss of pressure would be\r\ngreater for high pressures, everything else being equal. This pipe, having\r\na diameter of 0.127 m. (5 in.), was subjected to an initial pressure of 52\r\natmospheres. The author gives below the results obtained for a straight\r\nlength 320 m. (1050 ft) long; and has placed beside them the results which\r\nD'Arcy's formula would give.\r\n\r\n              Loss of head, in meters or ft. respectively\r\n                    per 100 meters or ft. run of pipes.\r\n                  +-----------------^-------------------+\r\n                  |                                     |\r\n                                     Calculated loss.\r\n                                +-----------^-----------+\r\n                                |                       |\r\nVelocity of flow  Actual loss\r\n   per second.     observed.

It would be very desirable that fresh experiments should\r\nbe made on water pipes at high pressure, and of various diameters. Of\r\nmachines worked by water pressure the author proposes to refer only to two\r\nwhich appear to him in every respect the most practical and advantageous.\r\nOne is the piston machine of M. Albert Schmid, engineer at Zurich. The\r\ncylinder is oscillating, and the distribution is effected, without an\r\neccentric, by the relative motion of two spherical surfaces fitted one\r\nagainst the other, and having the axis of oscillation for a common axis.\r\nThe convex surface, which is movable and forms part of the cylinder, serves\r\nas a port face, and has two ports in it communicating with the two ends of\r\nthe cylinder. The concave surface, which is fixed and plays the part of a\r\nslide valve, contains three openings, the two outer ones serving to admit\r\nthe pressure water, and the middle one to discharge the water after it has\r\nexerted its pressure. The piston has no packing. Its surface of contact has\r\ntwo circumferential grooves, which produce a sort of water packing acting\r\nby adhesion. A small air chamber is connected with the inlet pipe, and\r\nserves to deaden the shocks. This engine is often made with two cylinders,\r\nhaving their cranks at right angles.\r\n\r\nThe other engine, which is much less used, is a turbine on Girard's system,\r\nwith a horizontal axis and partial admission, exactly resembling in\r\nminiature those which work in the hydraulic factory of St. Maur, near\r\nParis. The water is introduced by means of a distributer, which is fitted\r\nin the interior of the turbine chamber, and occupies a certain portion\r\nof its circumference. This turbine has a lower efficiency than Schmid's\r\nmachine, and is less suitable for high pressures; but it possesses this\r\nadvantage over it, that by regulating the amount of opening of the\r\ndistributer, and consequently the quantity of water admitted, the force can\r\nbe altered without altering the velocity of rotation. As it admits of great\r\nspeeds, it could be usefully employed direct, without the interposition of\r\nspur wheels or belts for driving magneto-electric machines employed for the\r\nproduction of light, for electrotyping, etc.\r\n\r\nIn compressed air machines the losses of pressure due to incomplete\r\nexpansion, cooling, and waste spaces, play an important part. In water\r\npressure machines loss does not occur from these causes, on account of the\r\nincompressibility of the liquid, but the frictions of the parts are the\r\nprincipal causes of loss of power. It would be advisable to ascertain\r\nwhether, as regards this point, high or low pressures are the most\r\nadvantageous. Theoretical considerations would lead the author to imagine\r\nthat for a piston machine low pressures are preferable. In conclusion, the\r\nfollowing table gives the efficiencies of a Girard turbine, constructed by\r\nMessrs. Escher Wyss & Co., of Zurich, and of a Schmid machine, as measured\r\nby Professor Fliegnor, in 1871:\r\n\r\n           ESCHER WYSS & CO'S TURBINE.\r\n\r\nEffective Head of Water.

If,\r\nhowever, the electric current, instead of being developed by chemical\r\nwork in a battery, is produced by ordinary mechanical power in a\r\nmagneto-electric or dynamo-electric machine, the case is different; and\r\nthe double transformation, first of the mechanical force into an electric\r\ncurrent, and then of that current into mechanical force, furnishes a means\r\nfor effecting the conveyance of the power to a distance.\r\n\r\nIt is this last method of transmission which remains to be discussed. The\r\nauthor, however, feels himself obliged to restrict himself in this matter\r\nto a mere summary; and, indeed, it is English physicists and engineers who\r\nhave taken the technology of electricity out of the region of empiricism\r\nand have placed it on a scientific and rational basis. Moreover, they are\r\nalso taking the lead in the progress which is being accomplished in this\r\nbranch of knowledge, and are best qualified to determine its true bearings.\r\nWhen an electric current, with an intensity, i, is produced, either by\r\nchemical or mechanical work, in a circuit having a total resistance, R, a\r\nquantity of heat is developed in the circuit, and this heat is the exact\r\nequivalent of the force expended, so long as the current is not made use of\r\nfor doing any external work. The expression for this quantity of heat, per\r\nunit of time, is Ai²R; A being the thermal equivalent of the unit of power\r\ncorresponding to the units of current and resistance, in which i and R are\r\nrespectively expressed. The product, i²R, is a certain quantity of power,\r\nwhich the author proposes to call _power transformed into electricity_.\r\nWhen mechanical power is employed for producing a current by means of\r\na magneto-electric or dynamo-electric machine--or, to use a better\r\nexpression, by means of a _mechanical generator of electricity_--it is\r\nnecessary in reality to expend a greater quantity of power than i²R in\r\norder to make up for losses which result either from ordinary friction\r\nor from certain electro magnetic reactions which occur. The ratio of the\r\nquantity, i²R, to the power, W, actually expended per unit of time is\r\ncalled the efficiency of the generator. Designating it by K, we obtain, W\r\n= i²R/K. It is very important to ascertain the value of this efficiency,\r\nconsidering that it necessarily enters as a factor into the evaluation of\r\nall the effects to be produced by help of the generator in question. The\r\nfollowing table gives the results of certain experiments made early in\r\n1879, with a Gramme machine, by an able physicist, M Hagenbach, Professor\r\nat the University at Basle, and kindly furnished by him to the author:\r\n\r\nRevolutions per minute                     935  919.5  900.5    893\r\n\r\nTotal resistance in Siemens' units        2.55   3.82   4.94   6.06\r\n\r\nTotal resistance in absolute units       2.435  3.648  4.718  5.787\r\n                                         x10^9  x10^9  x10^9  x10^9\r\n\r\nIntensity in chemical units              17.67  10.99   8.09   6.28\r\n\r\nIntensity in absolute units              2.828  1.759  1.295  1.005\r\n\r\nWork done i²R in absolute units         1948.6 1129.2  791.3  584.9\r\n                                         x10^7  x10^7  x10^7  x10^7\r\n\r\nWork done i²R in kilogrammes             198.6  115.1  80.66  59.62\r\n\r\nPower expended in kilogrammes            301.5  141.0  86.25  83.25\r\n\r\nEfficiency, per cent.                     65.9   81.6  93.5   71.6\r\n\r\nM. Hagenbach's dynamometric measurements were made by the aid of a brake.\r\nAfter each experiment on the electric machine, he applied the brake to the\r\nengine which he employed, taking care to make it run at precisely the same\r\nspeed, with the same pressure of steam, and with the same expansion as\r\nduring experiment. It would certainly be better to measure the force\r\nexpended during and not after the experiment, by means of a registering\r\ndynamometer. Moreover, M. Hagenbach writes that his measurements by means\r\nof the brake were very much prejudiced by external circumstances; doubtless\r\nthis is the reason of the divergences between the results obtained.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Dr. Hopkinson communicated to this institution the\r\nresults of some very careful experiments made on a Siemens machine. He\r\nmeasured the force expended by means of a registering dynamometer, and\r\nobtained very high coefficients of efficiency, amounting to nearly 90 per\r\ncent. M. Hagenbach also obtained from one machine a result only a little\r\nless than unity. Mechanical generators of electricity are certainly\r\ncapable of being improved in several respects, especially as regards their\r\nadaptation to certain definite classes of work. But there appears to\r\nremain hardly any margin for further progress as regards efficiency. Force\r\ntransformed into electricity in a generator may be expressed by i [omega] M\r\nC; [omega] being the angular velocity of rotation; M the magnetism of one\r\nof the poles, inducing or induced, which intervenes; and C a constant\r\nspecially belonging to each apparatus, and which is independent of\r\nthe units adopted. This constant could not be determined except by\r\nan integration practically impossible; and the product, M C, must be\r\nconsidered indivisible. Even in a magneto-electric machine (with permanent\r\ninducing magnets), and much more in a dynamo-electric machine (inducing by\r\nmeans of electro-magnets excited by the very current produced) the product,\r\nM C, is a function of the intensity. From the identity of the expressions,\r\ni²R and i [omega] M C we obtain the relation M C = IR/[omega] which\r\nindicates the course to be pursued to determine experimentally the law\r\nwhich connects the variations of M C with those of i. Some experiments made\r\nin 1876, by M. Hagenbach, on a Gramme dynamo-electric machine, appear to\r\nindicate that the magnetism, M C, does not increase indefinitely with the\r\nintensity, but that there is some maximum value for this quantity. If,\r\ninstead of working a generator by an external motive force, a current is\r\npassed through its circuit in a certain given direction, the movable part\r\nof the machine will begin to turn in an opposite direction to that in which\r\nit would have been necessary to turn it in order to obtain a current in the\r\naforesaid direction. In virtue of this motion the electro-magnetic forces\r\nwhich are generated may be used to overcome a resisting force. The machine\r\nwill then work as a motor or receiver. Let i be the intensity of the\r\nexternal current which works the motor, when the motor is kept at rest. If\r\nit is now allowed to move, its motion produces, in virtue of the laws of\r\ninduction, a current in the circuit of intensity, i1, in the opposite\r\ndirection to the external current; the effective intensity of the current\r\ntraversing the circuit is thus reduced to i - i1. The intensity of the\r\ncounter current is given, like that of the generating current, by the\r\nequation, i1²R = i1 [omega]1 M1 C1, or i1R = [omega]1 M1 C1, the index, 1,\r\ndenoting the quantities relating to the motor. Here M1 C1 is a function of\r\ni - i1, not of i. As in a generator the force transformed into electricity\r\nhas a value, i [omega] M C, so in a motor the force developed by\r\nelectricity is (i - i1) [omega]1 M1 C1. On account, however, of the losses\r\nwhich occur, the effective power, that is the disposable power on the shaft\r\nof the motor, will have a smaller value, and in order to arrive at it a\r\ncoefficient of efficiency, K1, must be added. We shall then have W1 = K1\r\n(i-i1) [omega]1 M1 C1. The author has no knowledge of any experiments\r\nhaving been made for obtaining this efficiency, K1. Next let us suppose\r\nthat the current feeding the motor is furnished by a generator, so that\r\nactual transmission by electricity is taking place. The circuit, whose\r\nresistance is R, comprises the coils, both fixed and movable, of the\r\ngenerator and motor, and of the conductors which connect them. The\r\nintensity of the current which traverses the circuit had the value, i, when\r\nthe motor was at rest; by the working of the motor it is reduced to i - i1.\r\nThe power applied to the generator is itself reduced to W-[(i-i1)[omega]\r\nM C]/K. The prime mover is relieved by the action of the counter current,\r\nprecisely as the consumption of zinc in the battery would be reduced by the\r\nsame cause, if the battery was the source of the current. The efficiency\r\nof the transmission is W1/W. Calculation shows that it is expressed by the\r\nfollowing equations:W1/W = K K1 [([omega]11 M1 C1)/([omega]1 M C)], or = K\r\nK1 [([omega]11 M1 C)/([omega]11 M1 C1 + (i-i1) R)]; expressions in which\r\nit must be remembered M C and M1 C1 are really functions of (i-i1). This\r\nefficiency is, then, the product of three distinct factors, each evidently\r\nless than unity, namely, the efficiency belonging to the generator, the\r\nefficiency belonging to the motor, and a third factor depending on the rate\r\nof rotation of the motor and the resistance of the circuit. The influence\r\nwhich these elements exert on the value of the third factor cannot be\r\nestimated, unless the law is first known according to which the magnetisms,\r\nM C, M1 C C1, vary with the intensity of the current.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RESULTS.\r\n\r\nCasting a retrospective glance at the four methods of transmission of power\r\nwhich have been examined, it would appear that transmission by ropes forms\r\na class by itself, while the three other methods combine into a natural\r\ngroup, because they possess a character in common of the greatest\r\nimportance. It may be said that all three involve a temporary\r\ntransformation of the mechanical power to be utilized into potential\r\nenergy. Also in each of these methods the efficiency of transmission is\r\nthe product of three factors or partial efficiencies, which correspond\r\nexactly--namely, first, the efficiency of the instrument which converts\r\nthe actual energy of the prime mover into potential energy; second, the\r\nefficiency of the instrument which reconverts this potential energy into\r\nactual energy, that is, into motion, and delivers it up in this shape\r\nfor the actual operations which accomplish industrial work; third, the\r\nefficiency of the intermediate agency which serves for the conveyance of\r\npotential energy from the first instrument to the second.\r\n\r\nThis last factor has just been given for transmission by electricity. It\r\nis the exact correlative of the efficiency of the pipe in the case of\r\ncompressed air or of pressure water. It is as useful in the case of\r\nelectric transmission, as of any other method, to be able, in studying the\r\nsystem, to estimate beforehand what results it is able to furnish, and for\r\nthis purpose it is necessary to calculate exactly the factors which compose\r\nthe efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain this desirable knowledge, the author considers that the\r\nthree following points should form the aim of experimentalists: First,\r\nthe determination of the efficiency, K, of the principal kinds of\r\nmagneto-electric, or dynamo-electric machines working as generators;\r\nsecond, the determination of the efficiency, K1, of the same machines\r\nworking as motors; third, the determination of the law according to which\r\nthe magnetism of the cores of these machines varies with the intensity of\r\nthe current. The author is of opinion that experiments made with these\r\nobjects in view would be more useful than those conducted for determining\r\nthe general efficiency of transmission, for the latter give results only\r\navailable under precisely similar conditions. However, it is clear that\r\nthey have their value and must not be neglected.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, many other questions requiring to be elucidated by\r\nexperiment, especially as regards the arrangement of the conducting wires:\r\nbut it is needless to dwell further upon this subject, which has been ably\r\ntreated by many English men of science--for instance, Dr. Siemens and\r\nProfessor Ayrton. Nevertheless, for further information the author would\r\nrefer to the able articles published at Paris, by M. Mascart, in the\r\n_Journal de Physique_, in 1877 and 1878. The author would gladly have\r\nconcluded this paper with a comparison of the efficiencies of the four\r\nsystems which have been examined, or what amounts to the same thing--with a\r\ncomparison of the losses of power which they occasion. Unfortunately, such\r\na comparison has never been made experimentally, because hitherto the\r\nopportunity of doing it in a demonstrative manner has been wanting, for the\r\ntransmission of power to a distance belongs rather to the future than to\r\nthe present time. Transmission by electricity is still in its infancy; it\r\nhas only been applied on a small scale and experimentally.\r\n\r\nOf the three other systems, transmission by means of ropes is the only one\r\nthat has been employed for general industrial purposes, while compressed\r\nair and water under pressure have been applied only to special purposes,\r\nand their use has been due much more to their special suitableness for\r\nthese purposes than from any considerations relative to loss of power.\r\nThus the effective work of the compressed air used in driving the\r\ntunnels through the Alps, assuming its determination to be possible, was\r\nundoubtedly very low; nevertheless, in the present state of our appliances\r\nit is the only process by which such operations can be accomplished. The\r\nauthor believes that transmission by ropes furnishes the highest proportion\r\nof useful work, but that as regards a wide distribution of the transmitted\r\npower the other two methods, by air and water, might merit a preference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOTCHKISS REVOLVING GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hotchkiss revolving gun, already adopted in the French navy and by\r\nother leading European nations, has been ordered for use in the German navy\r\nby the following decree of the German Emperor, dated January 11 last: \"On\r\nthe report made to me, I approve the adoption of the Hotchkiss revolving\r\ncannon as a part of the artillery of my navy; and each of my ships,\r\naccording to their classification, shall in general be armed with this\r\nweapon in such a manner that every point surrounding the vessel may be\r\nprotected by the fire of at least two guns at a minimum range of 200\r\nmeters.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHALLIUM PAPERS AS OZONOMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchoene has given the results of an extended series of experiments on the\r\nuse of thallium paper for estimating approximately the oxidizing material\r\nin the atmosphere, whether it be hydrogen peroxide alone, or mixed with\r\nozone, or perhaps also with other constituents hitherto unknown. The\r\nobjection to Schönbein's ozonometer (potassium iodide on starch paper) and\r\nto Houzeau's ozonometer (potassium iodide on red litmus paper) lies in\r\nthe fact that their materials are hygroscopic, and their indications vary\r\nwidely with the moisture of the air. Since dry ozone does not act on these\r\npapers, they must be moistened; and then the amount of moisture varies the\r\nresult quite as much as the amount of ozone. Indeed, attention has been\r\ncalled to the larger amount of ozone near salt works and waterfalls, and\r\nthe erroneous opinion advanced that ozone is formed when water is finely\r\ndivided. And Böttger has stated that ozone is formed when ether is\r\natomized; the fact being that the reaction he observed was due to the\r\nH_2O_2 always present in ether. Direct experiments with the Schönbein\r\nozonometer and the psychrometer gave parallel curves; whence the author\r\nregards the former as only a crude hygrometer. These objections do not lie\r\nagainst the thallium paper, the oxidation to brown oxide by either ozone or\r\nhydrogen peroxide not requiring the presence of moisture, and the color,\r\ntherefore, being independent of the hygrometric state of the air. Moreover,\r\nwhen well cared for, the papers undergo no farther change of color and may\r\nbe preserved indefinitely. The author prepares the thallium paper a few\r\ndays before use, by dipping strips of Swedish filtering paper in a solution\r\nof thallous hydrate, and drying. The solution is prepared by pouring a\r\nsolution of thallous sulphate into a boiling solution of barium hydrate,\r\nequivalent quantities being taken, the resulting solution of thallous\r\nhydrate being concentrated in vacuo until 100 c.c. contains 10 grammes\r\nTl(OH). For use the strips are hung in the free air in a close vessel,\r\npreferably over caustic lime, for twelve hours. Other papers are used, made\r\nwith a two per cent. solution. These are exposed for thirty-six hours. The\r\ncoloration is determined by comparison with a scale having eleven degrees\r\nof intensity upon it. Compared with Schönbein's ozonometer, the results are\r\nin general directly opposite. The thallium papers show that the greatest\r\neffect is in the daytime, the iodide papers that it is at night. Yearly\r\ncurves show that the former generally indicate a rise when the latter give\r\na fall. The iodide curve follows closely that of relative humidity, clouds,\r\nand rain; the thallium curve stands in no relation to it. A table of\r\nresults for the year 1879 is given in monthly means, of the two thallium\r\npapers, the ozonometer, the relative humidity, cloudiness, rain, and\r\nvelocity of wind.--_G. F. B., in Ber.

Some 20 per cent. of the pupils in deaf and dumb schools have\r\nsufficient power of hearing when assisted by the audiphone to enable them\r\nto take their places in the classes of the ordinary schools.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCTIVITY OF MOIST AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany physical treatises still assert that moist air conducts electricity,\r\nthough Silberman and others have proved the contrary. An interesting\r\nexperiment bearing on this has been described lately by Prof. Marangoni.\r\nOver a flame is heated some water in a glass jar, through the stopper of\r\nwhich passes a bent tube to bell-jar (held obliquely), which thus gets\r\nfilled with aqueous vapor. The upper half of a thin Leyden jar charged is\r\nbrought into the bell-jar, and held there four or five seconds; it is\r\nthen found entirely discharged. That the real cause of this, however, is\r\ncondensation of the vapor on the part of the glass that is not coated with\r\ntin foil (the liquid layer acting by conduction) can be proved; for if that\r\npart of the jar be passed several times rapidly through the flame, so as\r\nto heat it to near 100° C., before inserting in the bell-jar, a different\r\neffect will be had; the Leyden jar will give out long sparks after\r\nwithdrawal. This is because the glass being heated no longer condenses the\r\nvapor on its surface, and there is no superficial conduction, as in the\r\nprevious case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOATING PONTOON DOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been given for some years past to the subject of\r\nfloating pontoon docks by Mr. Robert Turnbull, naval architect, of South\r\nShields, Eng., who has devised the ingenious arrangement which forms the\r\nsubject of the annexed illustration. The end aimed at and now achieved by\r\nMr. Turnbull was so to construct floating docks or pontoons that they may\r\nrise and fall in a berth, and be swung round at one end upon a center post\r\nor cylinder--nautically known as a dolphin--projecting from the ground at\r\na slight distance from the berth. The cylinder is in deep water, and,\r\nwhen the pontoon is swung and sunk to the desired depth by letting in the\r\nnecessary amount of water, a vessel can be floated in and then secured. The\r\npontoon, with the vessel on it, is then raised by pumping out the contained\r\nwater until she is a little above the level of the berth. The whole is then\r\nswung round over the berth, the vessel then being high and dry to enable\r\nrepairs or other operations to be conducted. For this purpose, one end of\r\nthe pontoon is so formed as to enable it to fit around the cylinder, and\r\nto be held to it as to a center or fulcrum, about which the pontoon can be\r\nswung. The pontoon is of special construction, and has air-chambers at the\r\nsides placed near the center, so as to balance it. It also has chambers at\r\nthe ends, which are divided horizontally in order that the operation of\r\nsubmerging within a berth or in shallow water may be conducted without\r\nrisk, the upper chambers being afterwards supplied with water to sink the\r\npontoon to the full depth before a vessel is hauled in. When the ship is in\r\nplace, the pontoon with her is then lifted above the level of the berth in\r\nwhich it has to be placed, and then swung round into the berth. In some\r\ncases, the pontoon is provided with a cradle, so that, when in berth, the\r\nvessel on the cradle can be hauled up a slip with rails arranged as\r\na continuation of the cradle-rails of the pontoon, which can be then\r\nfurnished with another cradle, and another vessel lifted.\r\n\r\nIt is this latter arrangement which forms the subject of our illustration,\r\nthe vessel represented being of the following dimensions: Length between\r\nperpendiculars, 350 feet; breadth, moulded, 40 feet; depth, moulded, 32\r\nfeet; tons, B. M., 2,600; tons net, 2,000. At A, in fig. 1, is shown in\r\ndotted lines a portion of the vessel and pontoon, the ship having just been\r\nhauled in and centered over the keel blocks. At B, is shown the pontoon\r\nwith the ship raised and swung round on to a low level quay. Going a step\r\nfurther in the operation, we see at C, the vessel hauled on to the slipways\r\non the high-level quay. In this case the cylinder is arranged so that\r\nthe vessel may be delivered on to the rails or slips, which are arranged\r\nradially, taking the cylinder as the center. There may be any number of\r\nslips so arranged, and one pontoon may be made available for several\r\ncylinders at the deep water parts of neighboring repairing or building\r\nyards, in which case the recessed portion of the pontoon, when arranged\r\naround the cylinder, has stays or retaining bars fitted to prevent it\r\nleaving the cylinder when the swinging is taking place, such as might\r\nhappen in a tideway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. IMPROVED FLOATING PONTOON DRY DOCK.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for delivering vessels on radial slips is seen in plan at\r\nfig. 2, where A represents the river or deep water; B is the pontoon with\r\nthe vessel; C being the cylinder or turning center; D is the low-level\r\nquay on to which the pontoon carrying the ship is first swung; E is the\r\nhigh-level quay with the slip-ways; F is an engine running on rails around\r\nthe radial slips for drawing the vessels with the cradle off the pontoon,\r\nand hauling them up on to the high-level quay; and G shows the repairing\r\nshops, stores, and sheds. A pontoon attached to a cylinder may be fitted\r\nwith an ordinary wet dock; and then the pontoon, before or after the vessel\r\nis upon it, can be slewed round to suit the slips up which the vessel has\r\nto be moved, supposing the slips are arranged radially. In this case, the\r\npivot end of the pontoon would be a fixture, so to speak, to the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe pontoon may also be made available for lifting heavy weights, by\r\nfitting a pair of compound levers or other apparatus at one end, the\r\nlifting power being in the pontoon itself. In some cases, in order to\r\nlengthen the pontoon, twenty-five or fifty foot lengths are added at\r\nthe after end. When not thus engaged, those lengths form short pontoons\r\nsuitable for small vessels.--_Iron_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIRLEIGH, BRENCHLEY, KENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few years since, Mr. Harrison Weir (whose drawings of natural history\r\nare known probably to a wider circle of the general public than the works\r\nof most artists), wishing to pursue his favorite study of animals and\r\nhorticulture, erected on the steep hillside of the road leading from\r\nPaddock Wood to Brenchley, a small \"cottage ornée\" with detached studio.\r\nAfterward desiring more accommodation, he carried out the buildings shown\r\nin our illustrations.

G. A. Bonwill, M.D., D.D.S., Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the kind invitation of your directors, I am present to give you\r\nthe history of \"rapid breathing\" as an analgesic agent, as well as my\r\nexperience therein since I first discovered it. It is with no little\r\nfeeling of modesty that I appear before such a learned and honorable\r\nbody of physicians and surgeons, and I accept the privilege as a high\r\ncompliment. I trust the same liberal spirit which prompted you to call this\r\nsubject to the light of investigation will not forsake you when you have\r\nheard all I have to say and you sit in judgment thereon. Sufficient time\r\nhas now elapsed since the first promulgation of the subject for the shafts\r\nof ridicule to be well nigh spent (which is the common logic used to crush\r\nout all new ideas), and it is to be expected that gentlemen will look upon\r\nit with all the charity of a learned body, and not be too hasty to condemn\r\nwhat they have had but little chance to investigate; and, of course, have\r\nnot practiced with that success which can only come from an intelligent\r\nunderstanding of its application and _modus operandi_.\r\n\r\nKnowing the history of past discoveries, I was well prepared for the\r\ncrucible. I could not hope to be an exception. But, so far, the medical\r\nprofession have extended me more favor than I have received at the hands of\r\nthe dental profession.\r\n\r\nMy first conception of the analgesic property of a pain obtunder in\r\ncontradistinction to its anaesthetic effect, which finally led to the\r\ndiscovery of the inhalation of common air by \"rapid breathing,\" was in 1855\r\nor 1856, while performing upon my own teeth certain operations which gave\r\nme intense pain (and I could not afford to hurt myself) without a resort to\r\nether and chloroform. These agents had been known so short a time that no\r\none was specially familiar with their action. Without knowing whether I\r\ncould take chloroform administered by myself, and at the same time perform\r\nwith skill the excavation of extremely sensitive dentine or tooth-bone, as\r\nif no anaesthetic had been taken, and not be conscious of pain, was more\r\nthan the experience of medical men at that time could assure me. But,\r\nhaving a love for investigation of the unknown, I prepared myself for the\r\nordeal. By degrees I took the chloroform until I began to feel very plainly\r\nits primary effects, and knowing that I must soon be unconscious, I applied\r\nthe excavator to the carious tooth, and, to my surprise, found no pain\r\nwhatever, but the sense of touch and hearing were marvelously intensified.\r\nThe small cavity seemed as large as a half bushel; the excavator more the\r\nsize of an ax; and the sound was equally magnified. That I might not be\r\nmistaken, I repeated the operation until I was confident that anaesthetics\r\npossessed a power not hitherto known--that of analgesia. To be doubly\r\ncertain, I gave it in my practice, in many cases with the same happy\r\nresults, which saved me from the risks incident to the secondary effects of\r\nanaesthetics, and which answered for all the purposes of extracting from\r\none to four teeth. Not satisfied with any advance longer than I could find\r\na better plan, I experimented with the galvanic current (to and fro) by so\r\napplying the poles that I substituted a stronger impression by electricity\r\nfrom the nerve centers or ganglia to the peripheries than was made from the\r\nperiphery to the brain. This was so much of a success that I threw\r\naside chloroform and ether in removing the living nerve of a tooth with\r\ninstruments instead of using arsenic; and for excavating sensitive caries\r\nin teeth, preparatory to filling, as well as many teeth extracted by it.\r\nBut this was short-lived, for it led to another step. Sometimes I would\r\ninflict severe pain in cases of congested pulps or from its hasty\r\napplication, or pushing it to do too much, when my patient invariably would\r\ndraw or inhale the breath _very forcibly and rapidly_. I was struck with\r\nthe repeated coincidence, and was led to exclaim: \"Nature's anaesthetic.\"\r\nThis then reminded me of boyhood's bruises. The involuntary action of every\r\none who has a finger hurt is to place it to the mouth and draw violently in\r\nthe air and hold it for an instant, and again repeat it until the pain is\r\nsubdued. The same action of the lungs occurs, except more powerfully,\r\nin young children who take to crying when hurt. It will be noticed they\r\nbreathe very rapidly while furiously crying, which soon allays the\r\nirritation, and sleep comes as the sequel. Witness also when one is\r\nsuddenly startled, how violently the breath is taken, which gives relief.\r\nThe same thing occurs in the lower animals when pain is being inflicted at\r\nthe hand of man.\r\n\r\nThis was advance No. 3, and so sure was I of this new discovery, that I at\r\nonce made an application while removing decay from an extremely sensitive\r\ntooth. To be successful, I found I must make the patient take the start,\r\nand I would follow with a thrust from the excavator, which move would be\r\naccomplished before the lungs could be inflated. This was repeated for\r\nat least a minute, until the operation was completed, I always following\r\nimmediately or synchronously with the inhalation.\r\n\r\nThis led to step No. 4, which resulted in its application to the extracting\r\nof teeth and other operations in minor surgery.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had believed the sole effect of the rapid inhalation was\r\ndue to mere diversion of the will, and this was the only way nature could\r\nso violently exert herself--that of controlling the involuntary action of\r\nthe lungs to her uses by the _safety valve_, or the voluntary movement.\r\n\r\nThe constant breathing of the patient for thirty seconds to a minute left\r\nhim in a condition of body and mind resembling the effects of ether and\r\nchloroform in their primary stages. I could but argue that the prolonged\r\nbreathing each time had done it; and, if so, then there must be some\r\nspecific effect over and above the mere diversion by the will. To what\r\ncould it be due? To the air alone, which went in excess into the lungs in\r\nthe course of a minute! Why did I not then immediately grasp the idea of\r\nits broader application as now claimed for it? It was too much, gentlemen,\r\nfor that hour. Enough had been done in this fourth step of conception to\r\nrest in the womb of time, until by evolution a higher step could be made at\r\nthe maturity of the child. Being self-satisfied with my own baby, I watched\r\nand caressed it until it could take care of itself, and my mind was again\r\nfree for another conception.\r\n\r\nThe births at first seemed to come at very short intervals; but see how\r\nlong it was between the fourth and the fifth birth. It was soon after that\r\nmy mind became involved in inventions--a hereditary outgrowth--and the\r\nelectric mallet and then the dental engine, the parent of your surgical\r\nengine, to be found in the principal hospitals of this city, took such\r\npossession of my whole soul, that my air analgesic was left slumbering. It\r\nwas not until August, 1875--nineteen years after--that it again came up in\r\nfull force, without any previous warning.\r\n\r\nThis time it was no law of association that revived it; but it seemed\r\nthe whispering of some one in the air--some ethereal spirit, if you\r\nplease--which instituted it, and advanced the following problem: \"Nitrous\r\noxide gas is composed of the same elements as ordinary air, with a larger\r\nequivalent of oxygen, except it is a chemical compound, not a mechanical\r\nmixture, and its anaesthetic effects are said to be due to the excess of\r\noxygen. If this be a fact, then why can you not produce a similar effect by\r\nrapid breathing for a minute, more or less, by which a larger quantity of\r\noxygen is presented in the lungs for absorption by the blood?\"\r\n\r\nThis query was soon answered by asking myself another: \"If the rapid\r\ninhalation of air into the lungs does not increase the heart's action and\r\ncause it to drive the blood in exact ratio to the inhalations, then _I can_\r\nproduce partial anaesthesia from this excess of oxygen brought about by the\r\nvoluntary movements over their ordinary involuntary action of the lungs.\"\r\nThe next question was: Will my heart be affected by this excess of air in\r\nthe lungs to such an extent that there will be a full reciprocity between\r\nthem? Without making any trial of it, I argued that, while there is no\r\nother muscular movement than that of the chest as under the control of the\r\nwill, and as nature has given to the will the perfect control over the\r\nlungs to supply more or less air, as is demanded by the pneumogastric nerve\r\nfor the immediate wants of the economy, when the _involuntary action_ is\r\nnot sufficient; and the heart not being under the control of the will, and\r\nits action never accelerated or diminished except by a specific poison, or\r\nfrom the general activity of the person in violent running or working, the\r\nblood is forced into the heart faster and must get rid of it, when a larger\r\nsupply of oxygen is demanded and rapid breathing must occur, or asphyxia\r\nresult. I was not long in deciding that the heart _would not be\r\naccelerated_ but a trifle--say a tenth--and, under the circumstances, I\r\nsaid: \"The air _is_ an anaesthetic.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid course of argument, I was so profoundly convinced of its\r\ntruth, that without having first tried it upon my own person, I would have\r\nsat where I was, upon the curbstone, and had a tooth removed with the\r\nperfect expectation of absence of pain and of still being conscious of\r\ntouch. While yet walking with my children, I commenced to breathe as\r\nrapidly as possible, and, as anticipated, found my steps growing shorter\r\nand shorter, until I came to a stand, showing to my mind clearly that my\r\nargument in advance was right, so far as locomotion was concerned; and,\r\nupon referring to my pulse, I found but little acceleration.\r\n\r\nTo what other conclusion could I arrive from this argument, with the\r\nfoundation laid nineteen years before, when I established on my own person\r\nby experiment the fact of analgesia as induced from chloroform, with the\r\nmany experiments in rapid respiration on tooth bone?\r\n\r\nFrom this moment until its first application to the extraction of a tooth\r\nyou can well imagine my suspense. That I might not fail in the very first\r\nattempt, I compelled myself and others in my household to breathe rapidly\r\nto investigate the phenomenon. This gave me some idea as to the proper\r\nmethod of proceeding in its administering.\r\n\r\nThe first case soon appeared, and was a perfect success, going far beyond\r\nmy anticipations, for the effect was such as to produce a partial paralysis\r\nof the hands and arms to the elbow. Again and again I tried it in every\r\ncase of extraction and many other experiments, doubting my own senses for\r\na long time at a result so anomalous and paradoxical. I was reminded just\r\nhere of a phenomenon which gave me additional proof--that of blowing a\r\ndull fire to revive it. For a minute or so one blows and blows in rapid\r\nsuccession until, rising from the effort, a sense of giddiness for a\r\nfew moments so overcomes that the upright position is with difficulty\r\nmaintained. In this condition you are fitted for having a tooth extracted\r\nor an abscess lanced.\r\n\r\nBelieving that I had something new to offer which might be of use to\r\nsuffering humanity, I read the first article upon it Nov. 17, 1875, before\r\nthe Franklin Institute. Shortly after I was invited before the Northern\r\nMedical Society of this city to address them thereon. A number of medical\r\ngentlemen have been using it in their practice, while the bulk of them have\r\nspurned it as \"negative\" and preposterous, without an effort at trying it,\r\nwhich I can _now_ very well understand.\r\n\r\nUnless one is aware of the fact that in the use of any agent which has the\r\npower to suspend the volition, it can be taken to that point where he is\r\nstill conscious of _touch and hearing_, and at the same time not cognizant\r\nof pain inflicted, the action of rapid breathing could not be understood.\r\nAnd I regret to say that of three-fourths of the medical men I have talked\r\nwith on the subject they had not been aware of such a possibility from\r\nether and chloroform. Until this analgesic state could be established in\r\ntheir minds it was impossible to convince them that the excess of oxygen,\r\nas obtained by rapid breathing, could be made to produce a similar effect.\r\n_I_ should have been as reluctant as any one to believe it, had I not\r\npersonally experienced the effect while performing an operation which would\r\notherwise have been very painful. Such a result could not well be reached\r\nby any course of reasoning.\r\n\r\nHas it proven in my practice what has been claimed for it--a substitute\r\nfor the powerful anaesthetics in minor operations in surgery? Most\r\nemphatically, yes! So completely has it fulfilled its humble mission in\r\nmy office, that I can safely assert there has not been more than five per\r\ncent. of failures. I have given it under all circumstances of diseased\r\norgans, and have seen no other than the happiest results in its after\r\neffects. It may well be asked just here: Why has it not been more generally\r\nand widely used by the dental profession as well as the medical, if it is\r\nreally what is claimed for it? The most satisfactory and charitable answer\r\nto be given is, the failure upon their part to comprehend the _fact_ as\r\nexisting in chloroform and ether that there is such a state as analgesia;\r\nor, in other words, that the animal economy is so organized, while the\r\nsense of touch is not destroyed, but rather increased, the mind of the\r\nsubject fails to perceive a sense of pain when anaesthetics are given, and\r\nthe effects are manifested in the primary stage. As I before intimated,\r\nsuch is the knowledge possessed by most of those who administer ether and\r\nchloroform. This was enough to cause nearly every one to look upon it as a\r\nbubble or air castle. Many gentlemen told me they tried it upon themselves,\r\nand, while it affected them very seriously by giddiness, they still\r\n_retained consciousness_; and, such being the case, no effect could be\r\nproduced for obtunding pain. Others told me they were afraid to continue\r\nthe breathing alarmed at the vertigo induced. And the practitioner who has\r\nadopted it more effectively than any other laughed at me when I first told\r\nhim of the discovery; but his intimate association with me changed his\r\nviews after much explanation and argument between us.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected that without this knowledge of analgesia,\r\nand without any explanation from me as to the _modus operandi_ of rapid\r\nbreathing, other than a few suggestions or directions as to how the effect\r\nwas induced, even the most liberal of medical men should be able to make\r\nit effective, or have the least disposition to give it a preliminary trial\r\nupon themselves, and, of course, would not attempt it upon a patient.\r\nNotwithstanding, it found a few adherents, but only among my personal\r\n_medical_ friends, with whom I had an opportunity to explain what I\r\nbelieved its physiological action, and the cases of success in my own\r\npractice. To this I have submitted as among the inevitable in the calendar\r\nof discoveries of all grades.\r\n\r\nMy own profession have attempted to _ridicule_ it out of its birthright\r\nand possible existence, which style of argument is not resorted to by true\r\nlogicians.\r\n\r\nTo all this I can truly say I have not for one moment faltered. I could\r\nafford to wait. The liberality of this society alone fully compensates for\r\nthe seeming indisposition of the past, believing that it is proper that\r\nevery advance should be confronted, and, if in time found worthy, give it\r\nGod speed.\r\n\r\nFrom its first conception I have diligently labored to solve its _modus\r\noperandi_, and the doubt in my own mind as to whether I could be mistaken\r\nin my observations. I asked the opinion of our best chemical teachers if\r\nair could have such effect. One attributed it to oxygen stimulation, and\r\nthe other to nitrogen. Another gentleman told me the medical profession had\r\ncome to the conclusion that it was possible for me to thus extract teeth,\r\nbut it was due solely to my strong _personal magnetism_ (which power I was\r\nnot before aware I possessed).\r\n\r\nNow, from what I have related of the successive and natural steps which\r\nfinally culminated in this process or plan of analgesia induced by an\r\nexcess of ordinary air taken forcibly into the lungs above what is\r\nnecessary for life, and from what I shall state as to the apparently\r\nanomalous or paradoxical effects, with its physiological action, and the\r\nsimple tests made upon each of my patients, I shall trust to so convince\r\nyou of its plausibility and possibility that it will be made use of in\r\nhundreds of minor operations where ether and chloroform are now used.\r\n\r\nAside from my assertion and that of its friends, that the effects can be\r\nproduced by air alone, you must have some light shed upon the causes of its\r\nphysiological action, which will appeal to your _medical_ reason.\r\n\r\nTo assign an action to any drug is difficult, and in the cases of ether and\r\nthe other anaesthetics a quarter of a century still finds many conflicting\r\nopinions. This being true, you will deal leniently with me for the opinion\r\nI hold as to their analgesic action. Of course it will be objected to,\r\nfor the unseen is, to a great extent, unknowable. Enough for my argument,\r\nhowever; it seems to suit the case very well without looking for another;\r\nand while it was based on the phenomenon resulting from many trials, and\r\nnot the trials upon it as a previous theory, I shall be content with it\r\nuntil a better one can be found.\r\n\r\nWhat is it I claim as a new discovery, and the facts and its philosophy?\r\n\r\nI have asserted that I can produce, from rapidly breathing common air at\r\nthe rate of a hundred respirations a minute, a similar effect to that from\r\nether, chloroform, and nitrous oxide gas, in their primary stages; and I\r\ncan in this way render patients sufficiently insensible to acute pain from\r\nany operation where the time consumed is not over twenty to thirty seconds.\r\nWhile the special senses are in partial action, the sense of pain is\r\nobtunded, and in many cases completely annulled, consciousness and general\r\nsensibility being preserved.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, each patient must be instructed how to act and what to\r\nexpect. As simple as it may seem, there is a proper and consistent plan to\r\nenable you to reach full success. Before the patient commences to inhale he\r\nis informed of the fact that, while he will be unconscious of pain, he\r\nwill know full, or partially well, every touch upon the person; that the\r\ninhalation must be vigorously kept up during the whole operation without\r\nfor an instant stopping; that the more energetically and steadily he\r\nbreathes, the more perfect the effect, and that if he cease breathing\r\nduring the operation, pain will be felt. Fully impress them with this\r\nidea, for the very good reason that they may stop when in the midst of an\r\noperation, and the fullest effects be lost. It is obligatory to do so on\r\naccount of its evanescent effects, which demand that the patient be pushed\r\nby the operator's own energetic appeals to \"go on.\" It is very difficult\r\nfor any person to respire more than one hundred times to the minute, as he\r\nwill become by that time so exhausted as not to be able to breathe at all,\r\nas is evidenced by all who have thus followed my directions. For the next\r\nminute following the completion of the operation the subject will not\r\nbreathe more than once or twice. Very few have force enough left to raise\r\nhand or foot. The voluntary muscles have nearly all been subjugated and\r\novercome by the undue effort at forced inhalation of one hundred over\r\nseventeen, the normal standard. It will be more fully understood further on\r\nin my argument why I force patients, and am constantly speaking to them to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nI further claim that for the past four years, so satisfactory has been the\r\nresult of this system in the extracting of teeth and deadening extremely\r\nsensitive dentine, there was no longer any necessity for chloroform,\r\nether, or nitrous oxide in the dental office. That such teeth as cannot be\r\nextracted by its aid can well be preserved and made useful, except in a\r\nvery few cases, who will not be forced to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe anaesthetics, when used in major operations, where time is needed for\r\nthe operation, can be made more effective by a lesser quantity when given\r\nin conjunction with \"rapid breathing.\" Drs. Garrettson and Hews, who have\r\nthus tried it, tell me it takes one-half to three-fourths less, and the\r\nafter effects are far less nauseating and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAs an agent in labor where an anaesthetic is indicated, it is claimed by\r\none who has employed it (Dr. Hews) in nearly every case for three years, he\r\nhas used \"rapid breathing\" solely, and to the exclusion of chloroform and\r\nether. For this I have his assertion, and have no doubt of it whatever, for\r\nif any agent could break down the action of the voluntary muscles of the\r\nparts involved, which prevent the involuntary muscles of the uterus from\r\nhaving their fullest effect, it is this. The very act of rapid breathing so\r\naffects the muscles of the abdomen as to force the contents of the uterus\r\ndownward or outward, while the specific effect of the air at the end of a\r\nminute's breathing leaves the subject in a semi-prostrate condition, giving\r\nthe uterus full chance to act in the interim, because free of the will to\r\nmake any attempt at withholding the involuntary muscles of the uterus from\r\ndoing their natural work. It is self evident; and in this agent we claim\r\nhere a boon of inestimable value. And not least in such cases is, there is\r\nno danger of hemorrhage, since the cause of the effect is soon removed.\r\n\r\nIn attestation of many cases where it has been tried, I have asked the\r\nmother, and, in some cases, the attendants, whether anything else had been\r\ngiven, and whether the time was very materially lessened, there has been\r\nbut one response, and that in its favor.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, if we are not mistaken in this, you will agree with me in saying\r\nthat it is no mean thing, and should be investigated by intelligent men and\r\nreported upon. From my own knowledge of its effects in my practice, I am\r\nbound to believe this gentleman's record.\r\n\r\nI further claim for it a special application in dislocations. It has\r\ncertainly peculiar merits here, as the will is so nearly subjugated by\r\nit as to render the patient quite powerless to resist your effort at\r\nreplacing, and at the same time the pain is subdued.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary I should further continue special applications; when\r\nits _modus operandi_ is understood, its adaptation to many contingencies\r\nwill of a sequence follow.\r\n\r\nIt is well just here, before passing to the next point of consideration, to\r\nanswer a query which may arise at this juncture:\r\n\r\nWhat are the successive stages of effects upon the economy from its\r\ncommencement until the full effect is observed, and what proof have I that\r\nit was due to the amount of air inhaled?\r\n\r\nThe heart's action is not increased more than from seventy (the average) to\r\neighty and sometimes ninety, but is much enfeebled, or throwing a lesser\r\nquantity of blood. The face becomes suffused, as in blowing a fire or in\r\nstooping, which continues until the breathing is suspended, when the\r\nface becomes paler. (Have not noticed any purple as from asphyxia by a\r\ndeprivation of oxygen.) The vision becomes darkened, and a giddiness soon\r\nappears. The voluntary muscles furthest from the heart seem first to be\r\naffected, and the feet and hands, particularly the latter, have a numbness\r\nat their ends, which increases, until in many cases there is partial\r\nparalysis as far as the elbow, while the limbs become fixed. The hands are\r\nso thoroughly affected that, when open, the patient is powerless to close\r\nthem and _vice versa_. There is a vacant gaze from the eyes and looking\r\ninto space without blinking of the eyelids for a half minute or more. The\r\nhead seems incapable of being held erect, and there is no movement of the\r\narms or legs as is usual when in great pain. There is no disposition on the\r\npart of the patient to take hold of the operator's hand or interfere with\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nMany go on breathing mechanically after the tooth is removed, as if nothing\r\nhad occurred. Some are aware that the tooth has been extracted, and say\r\nthey felt it; others could not tell what had been accomplished. The\r\nmajority of cases have an idea of what is being done, but are powerless to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nWith the very intelligent, or those who stop to reason, I have to teach\r\nthem the peculiarities of being sensible of touch and not of pain.\r\n\r\nOne very interesting case I will state. In extracting seven teeth for a\r\nlady who was very _unwilling_ to believe my statement as to touch and no\r\npain, I first removed three teeth after having inhaled for one minute, and\r\nwhen fully herself, she stated that she could not understand why there was\r\nno pain while she was conscious of each one extracted; it was preposterous\r\nto believe such an effect could be possible, as her reason told her that\r\nthere is connected with tooth extracting pain in the part, and of severe\r\ncharacter, admitting, though, she felt no pain. She allowed one to be\r\nremoved without anything, and she could easily distinguish the change, and\r\nexclaimed, \"It is all the difference imaginable!\" When the other three were\r\nextracted, there was perfect success again as with the first three.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marked proofs of the effects of rapid breathing was that of\r\na boy of eleven years of age for whom I had to extract the upper and lower\r\nfirst permanent molars on each side. He breathed for nearly a minute, when\r\nI removed in about twenty seconds all four of the teeth, without a moment's\r\nintermission or the stopping the vigorous breathing; and not a murmur,\r\nsigh, or tear afterward.\r\n\r\nHe declared there was no pain, and we needed no such assertion, for there\r\nwas not the first manifestation from him that he was undergoing such a\r\nsevere operation.\r\n\r\nAnother case, the same day, when I had to extract the superior wisdom teeth\r\non both sides for an intelligent young lady of eighteen years, where I had\r\nto use two pairs of forceps on each tooth (equivalent to extraction of four\r\nteeth), and she was so profoundly affected afterward that she could; not\r\ntell me what had been done other than that I had touched her four times.\r\nShe was overcome from its effects for at least a minute afterward. She was\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\nWith such severe tests I fear very little the result in any case I can have\r\nthem do as I bid.\r\n\r\nThere can be no mistake that there is a _specific action_ from something.\r\nIt cannot be personal magnetism or mesmeric influence exerted by me, for\r\nsuch cases are rare, averaging about 10 per cent, only of all classes.\r\nBesides, in mesmeric influence the time has nothing to do with it; whereas,\r\nin my cases, it cannot last over a half minute or minute at most. It cannot\r\nbe fear, as such cases are generally more apt to get hurt the worse. It is\r\nnot diversion of mind alone, as we have an effect above it.\r\n\r\nThere is no better way of testing whether pain has been felt than by taking\r\nthe lacerated or contused gums of the patient between the index finger\r\nand thumb and making a gentle pressure to collapse the alveolar borders;\r\ninvariably, they will cry out lustily, _that is pain_! This gives undoubted\r\nproof of a specific agent. There is no attempt upon my _own_ part to exert\r\nany influence over my patients in any way other than that they shall\r\nbelieve what I say in regard to _giving_ them _no pain_ and in the\r\nfollowing of my orders. Any one who knows how persons become mesmerized can\r\nattest that it was not the _operator who forces them under it against\r\ntheir will_, but it is a peculiar state into which any one who has within\r\nthemselves this temperament can _place_ themselves where any one who knows\r\nhow can have control. It is not the will of the operator. I therefore\r\ndismiss this as unworthy of consideration in connection with rapid\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nThen you may now ask, To what do I attribute this very singular phenomenon?\r\n\r\nAny one who followed, in the earlier part of this paper, the course of\r\nthe argument in my soliloquy, after twenty years had elapsed from my\r\nobservation upon myself of the analgesic effects of chloroform, can almost\r\ngive something of an answer.\r\n\r\nThat you may the more easily grasp what I shall say, I will ask you, If it\r\nbe possible for any human being to make one hundred inhalations in a minute\r\nand the heart's action is not increased more than ten or twenty pulsations\r\nover the normal, what should be the effect upon the brain and nerve\r\ncenters?\r\n\r\nIf the function of oxygen in common air is to set free in the blood,\r\neither in the capillaries alone, or throughout the whole of the arterial\r\ncirculation, carbonic acid gas; and that it cannot escape from the system\r\nunless it do so in the lungs as it passes in the general current--except\r\na trace that is removed by the skin and kidneys--and that the quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid gas set free is in exact relation to the amount of oxygen\r\ntaken into the blood, what effect _must be_ manifested where one hundred\r\nrespirations in one minute are made--five or six times the normal\r\nnumber--while the heart is only propelling the blood a very little faster\r\nthrough the lungs, and _more feebly_--say 90 pulsations at most, when to\r\nbe in proportion it should be 400 to 100 respirations to sustain life any\r\nlength of time?\r\n\r\nYou cannot deny the fact that a definite amount of oxygen can be absorbed\r\nand is absorbed as fast as it is carried into the lungs, even if there be\r\none hundred respirations to the minute, while the pulsations of the heart\r\nare only ninety! Nature has _made it_ possible to breathe so rapidly to\r\nmeet any emergency; and we can well see its beautiful application in the\r\nnormal action of both the heart and lungs while one is violently running.\r\n\r\nWhat would result, and that very speedily, were the act of respiration to\r\nremain at the standard--say 18 or 20--when the heart is in violent action\r\nfrom this running? Asphyxia would surely end the matter! And why? The\r\nexcessive exercise of the whole body is setting free from the tissues such\r\nan amount of excretive matter, and carbon more largely than all the others,\r\nthat, without a relative action of the lungs to admit the air that oxygen\r\nmay be absorbed, carbonic acid gas cannot be liberated through the lungs\r\nas fast as the waste carbon of the overworked tissues is being made by\r\ndisassimilation from this excess of respiration.\r\n\r\nYou are already aware how small a quantity of carbonic acid in excess in\r\nthe air will seriously affect life. Even 2 to 3 per cent, in a short time\r\nwill prove fatal. In ordinary respiration of 20 to the minute the average\r\nof carbonic acid exhaled is 4.35.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments long ago made by Vierordt--see Carpenter, p. 524--you will\r\nsee the relative per cent, of carbonic acid exhaled from a given number of\r\nrespirations. When he was breathing six times per minute, 5.5 per cent of\r\nthe exhaled air was carbonic acid; twelve times, 4.2; twenty-four times,\r\n3.3; forty-eight times, 3; ninety-six times, 2.6.\r\n\r\nRemember this is based upon the whole number of respirations in the minute\r\nand not each exhalation--which latter could not be measured by the most\r\nminute method.\r\n\r\nLet us deduct the minimum amount, 2.6 per cent, of carbonic acid when\r\nbreathing ninety-six times per minute, from the average, at twenty per\r\nminute, or the normal standard, which is recorded in Carpenter, p. 524, as\r\n4.35 per minute, and we have retained in the circulation nearly 2 per cent.\r\nof carbonic acid; that, at the average, would have passed off through the\r\nlungs without any obstruction, and life equalized; but it not having been\r\nthrown off as fast as it should have been, must, of necessity, be left to\r\nprey upon the brain and nerve centers; and as 2 to 3 per cent., we are\r\ntold, will so poison the blood, life is imperiled and that speedily.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary we should argue the point as to whether oxygen\r\ndisplaces carbonic acid in the tissues proper or the capillaries. The\r\ntheory of Lavoisier on this point has been accepted.\r\n\r\nWe know furthermore, as more positive, that tissues placed in an atmosphere\r\nof oxygen will set free carbonic acid, and that carbonic acid has a\r\nparalyzing effect upon the human hand held in it for a short time. The\r\ndirect and speedy effects of this acid upon the delicate nervous element of\r\nthe brain is so well known that it must be accepted as law. One of the most\r\nmarked effects is the suspension of locomotion of the legs and arms,\r\nand the direct loss of will power which must supervene before voluntary\r\nmuscular inactivity, which amounts to partial paralysis in the hands or\r\nfeet, or peripheral extremities of the same.\r\n\r\nNow that we have sufficient evidence from the authorities that carbonic\r\nacid can be retained in the blood by excessive breathing, and enough to\r\nseriously affect the brain, and what its effects are when taken directly\r\ninto the lungs in excess, we can enter upon what I have held as the most\r\nreasonable theory of the phenomenon produced by rapid breathing for\r\nanalgesic purposes; which _theory_ was not _first_ conceived and the\r\nprocess made to yield to it, but the phenomenon was long observed, and\r\nfrom the repetition of the effects and their close relationship to that\r\nof carbonic acid on the economy, with the many experiments performed\r\nupon myself, I am convinced that what I shall now state will be found to\r\nsubstantiate my discovery. Should it not be found to coincide with what\r\nsome may say is physiological truth, it will not invalidate the discovery\r\nitself; for of that I am far more positive than Harvey was of the discovery\r\nof the circulation of the blood; or of Galileo of the spherical shape of\r\nthe earth. And I ask that it shall not be judged by my theory, but from the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIt should have as much chance for investigation as the theory of\r\nJulius Robert Mayer, upon which he founded, or which gave rise to the\r\nestablishment of one of the most important scientific truths--\"the\r\nconservation of energy,\" and finally the \"correlation of forces,\" which\r\ntheory I am not quite sure was correct, although it was accepted, and as\r\nyet, I have not seen it questioned.\r\n\r\nIn all due respect to him I quote it from the sketch of that remarkable\r\nman, as given in the _Popular Science Monthly_, as specially bearing on my\r\ndiscovery:\r\n\r\n\"Mayer observed while living in Java, that the _venous blood_ of some of\r\nhis patients had a singularly bright red color. The observation riveted\r\nhis attention; he reasoned upon it, and came to the conclusion that the\r\nbrightness of the color was due to the fact that a less amount of oxidation\r\nwas sufficient to keep up the temperature of the body in a hot climate than\r\na cold one. The darkness of the venous blood he regarded as the visible\r\nsign of the energy of the oxidation.\"\r\n\r\nMy observation leads me to the contrary, that the higher the temperature\r\nthe more rapid the breathing to get clear of the excess of carbon, and\r\nhence more oxygenation of the blood which will arterialize the venous\r\nblood, unless there is a large amount of carbonized matter from the tissues\r\nto be taken up.\r\n\r\nNor must it be denied because of the reasoning as presented to my mind by\r\nsome outside influence in my soliloquy when I first exclaimed, \"Nature's\r\nanaesthetic,\" where the argument as to the effects of nitrous oxide gas\r\nbeing due to an excess of oxygen was urged, and that common air breathed in\r\nexcess would do the same thing.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that _it_ was correct, for the effects of nitrous oxide is,\r\nperhaps, due to a deprivation of mechanically mixed air.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I do of theory and practice, I can say with assurance that\r\nthere is not a medical practitioner who would long ponder in any urgent\r\ncase as to the thousand and one theories of the action of remedies; but\r\nwould resort to the _practical_ experience of others and his own finally.\r\n(What surgeon ever stops to ask how narcotics effect their influence?)\r\nAfter nearly thirty years of association with ether and chloroform, who can\r\npositively answer as to their _modus operandi?_ It is thus with nearly the\r\nwhole domain of medicine. It is not yet, by far, among the sciences, with\r\nimmutable laws, such as we have in chemistry. Experimentation is giving us\r\nmore specific knowledge, and \"practice alone has tended to make perfect.\"\r\n(Then, gentlemen will not set at naught my assertion and practical results.\r\nWhen I have stated my case in full it is for _you_ to disprove both the\r\ntheory and practice annunciated. So far as I am concerned I am responsible\r\nfor both.)\r\n\r\nYou will please bear with me for a few minutes in my attempt at theory.\r\n\r\nThe annulling of pain, and, in some cases, its complete annihilation,\r\ncan be accomplished in many ways. Narcotics, anaesthetics--local and\r\ninternal--direct action of cold, and mesmeric or physiological influence,\r\nhave all their advocates, and each _will surely_ do its work. There is one\r\nthing about which, I think, we can all agree, as to these agencies; unless\r\nthe _will_ is partially and in some cases completely subjugated there can\r\nbe no primary or secondary effect. The voluntary muscles must become wholly\r\nor partially paralyzed for the time. Telegraphic communication must be cut\r\noff from the brain, that there be no reflex action. It is not necessary\r\nthere should be separate nerves to convey pleasure and pain any more than\r\nthere should be two telegraphic wires to convey two messages.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we are certain of this, it matters little as to whether it was\r\ndone by corpuscular poisoning and anaemia as from chloroform or hyperaemia\r\nfrom ether.\r\n\r\nI think we are now prepared to show clearly the causes which effect the\r\nphenomena in \"rapid breathing.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing enlisted is the _diversion of the will force_ in the act of\r\nforced respiration at a moment when the heart and lungs have been in normal\r\nreciprocal action (20 respirations to 80 pulsations), which act could\r\nnot be made and carried up to 100 respirations per minute without such\r\nconcentrated effort that ordinary pain could make no impression upon the\r\nbrain while this abstraction is kept up.\r\n\r\nSecond. There is a specific effect resulting from enforced respiration of\r\n100 to the minute, due to the _excess of carbonic acid gas set free from\r\nthe tissues_, generated by this enforced normal act of throwing into the\r\nlungs _five times_ the normal amount of oxygen in one minute demanded, when\r\nthe heart has not been aroused to exalted action, which comes from violent\r\nexercise in running or where one is suddenly startled, which excess of\r\ncarbonic acid cannot escape in the same ratio from the lungs, since the\r\nheart does not respond to the proportionate overaction of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThird.--Hyperaemia is the last in this chain of effects, which is due to\r\nthe excessive amount of air passing into the lungs preventing but little\r\nmore than the normal quantity of blood from passing from the heart into\r\nthe arterial circulation, but draws it up in the brain with its excess of\r\ncarbonic acid gas to act also directly upon the brain as well as throughout\r\nthe capillary and venous system, and as well upon the heart, the same as if\r\nit were suspended in that gas outside the body.\r\n\r\nThese are evident to the senses of any liberal observer who can witness a\r\nsubject rapidly breathing.\r\n\r\nSome ask why is not this same thing produced when one has been running\r\nrapidly for a few minutes? For a very good reason: in this case the rapid\r\ninhalations are preceded by the violent throes of the heart to propel the\r\ncarbonized blood from the overworked tissues and have them set free at the\r\nlungs where the air is rushing in at the normal ratio of four to one. This\r\nis not an abnormal action, but is of necessity, or asphyxia would instantly\r\nresult and the runner would drop. Such sometimes occurs where the runner\r\nexerts himself too violently at the very outset; and to do so he is\r\ncompelled to hold his breath for this undue effort, and the heart cannot\r\ncarry the blood fast enough. In this instance there is an approach to\r\nanalgesia as from rapid breathing.\r\n\r\nLet me take up the first factor--_diversion of will_--and show that nature\r\ninvariably resorts to a sudden inhalation to prevent severe infliction of\r\npain being felt. It is the panacea to childhood's frequent bruises and\r\ncuts, and every one will remember how when a finger has been hurt it is\r\nthrust into the mouth and a violent number of efforts at rapid inhalation\r\nis effected until ease comes. By others it is subdued by a fit of crying,\r\nwhich if you will but imitate the sobs, will find how frequently the\r\nrespirations are made.\r\n\r\nOne is startled, and the heart would seem to jump out of the chest; in\r\nquick obedience to nature the person is found making a number of quick\r\ninhalations, which subdue the heart and pacify the will by diversion from\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is observed in the lower animals. I will relate a case:\r\n\r\nAn elephant had been operated upon for a diseased eye which gave him great\r\npain, for which he was unprepared, and he was wrathy at the keeper and\r\nsurgeon. It soon passed off, and the result of the application was so\r\nbeneficial to the animal that when brought out in a few days after, to have\r\nanother touch of caustic to the part, he was prepared for them; and, just\r\nbefore the touch, he inflated the lungs to their fullest extent, which\r\noccupied more time than the effect of the caustic, when he made no effort\r\nat resistance and showed no manifestation of having been pained.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of extraction of the temporary teeth of children, I make them\r\nat the instant I grasp the tooth take _one_ very violent inhalation, which\r\nis sufficient. Mesmeric anaesthesia can well be classified under diversion\r\nor subjugation of the will, but can be effected in but a small percentage\r\nof the cases. To rely upon this first or primary effect, except in\r\ninstantaneous cases, would be failure.\r\n\r\nThe second factor is the one upon which I can rely in such of the cases as\r\ncome into my care, save when I cannot induce them to make such a number of\r\nrespirations as is absolutely necessary. The _whole secret of success lies_\r\nin the greatest number of respirations that can be effected in from 60 to\r\n90 seconds, and that without any intermission. If the heart, by the _alow\r\nmethod of respiration_, is pulsating in ratio of four to one respiration,\r\n_no effect can be induced_.\r\n\r\nWhen the respirations are, say, 100 to the minute, and made with all the\r\nenergy the patient can muster, and are kept up while the operation is going\r\non, there can hardly be a failure in the minor operations.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this point many of you may question the facts. Before I tried\r\nit for the first time upon my own person, I arrived at the same conclusion\r\nfrom a course of argument, that rapid breathing would control the heart's\r\naction and pacify it, and even reduce it below the normal standard under my\r\nurgent respirations.\r\n\r\nIn view of the many applications made I feel quite sure in my belief that,\r\ninasmuch as the heart's action is but slightly accelerated, though with\r\nless force from rapid breathing at the rate of 100 to the minute, there is\r\nsuch an excess of carbonic acid gas set free and crowding upon the heart\r\nand capillaries of the brain, without a chance to escape by the lungs, that\r\nit is the same to all intents as were carbonic acid breathed through the\r\nlungs in common air. Look at the result after this has been kept up for a\r\nminute or more? During the next minute the respirations are not more than\r\none or two, and the heart has fallen really below, in some cases, the\r\nstandard beat, showing most conclusively that once oxygenation has taken\r\nplace and that the free carbonic acid gas has been so completely consumed,\r\nthat there is no involuntary call through the pneumogastric nerve for a\r\nsupply of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIf any physiological facts can be proven at all, then I feel quite sure of\r\nyour verdict upon my side.\r\n\r\nThere is no one thing that goes so far to prove the theory of Lavoisier\r\nregarding the action of oxygen in the tissues and capillaries for\r\nconverting carbon into carbonic acid gas instead of the lungs, as held\r\nprior to that time, and still held by many who are not posted in late\r\nexperiments. At the time I commenced this practice I must confess I knew\r\nnothing of it. The study of my cases soon led me to the same theory of\r\nLavoisier, as I could not make the phenomena agree with the old theory of\r\ncarbonic acid generated only in the lungs.\r\n\r\nWhen Vierordt was performing his experiments upon himself in rapid\r\nbreathing from six times per minute to ninety-six, I cannot understand\r\nwhy he failed to observe and record what did certainly result--an extreme\r\ngiddiness with muscular prostration and numbness in the peripheries of the\r\nhands and feet, with suffusion of the face, and such a loss of locomotion\r\nas to prevent standing erect without desiring support. Besides, the very\r\ngreat difference he found in the amount of carbonic acid retained in the\r\ncirculation, the very cause of the phenomena just spoken of.\r\n\r\nOne thing comes in just here to account for the lack of respiration the\r\nminute after the violent effort. The residual air, which in a normal state\r\nis largely charged with carbonic acid, has been so completely exhausted\r\nthat some moments are consumed before there is sufficient again to call\r\nupon the will for its discharge.\r\n\r\nAs to hyperaemia you will also assent, now that my second factor is\r\nexplained; but it is so nearly allied to the direct effect of excessive\r\nrespiration that we can well permit it to pass without argument. If\r\nhyperaemia _is present_, we have a more certain and rather more lasting\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will attempt to prognosticate the application of this\r\nprinciple to the cure of many diseases of chronic nature, and especially\r\ntuberculosis; where from a diminished amount of air going into the lungs\r\nfor want of capacity, and particularly for want of energy and inclination\r\nto breathe in full or excess, the tissues cannot get clear of their\r\nexcrementitious material, and particularly the carbon, which must go to the\r\nlungs, this voluntary effort can be made frequently during the day to\r\nfree the tissues and enable them to take nutritious material for their\r\nrestoration to their standard of health.\r\n\r\nAir will be found of far more value than ever before as one of the greatest\r\nof factors in nutrition, and which is as necessary as proper food, and\r\nwithout which every organization must become diseased, and no true\r\nassimilation can take place without a due amount of oxygen is hourly\r\nand daily supplied by this extra aid of volition which has been so long\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nThe pure oxygen treatment has certainly performed many cures; yet, when\r\ncompared to the mechanical mixture and under the direct control of\r\nthe will, at all times and seasons, there is no danger from excessive\r\noxygenation as while oxygen is given. When every patient can be taught to\r\nrely upon this great safety valve of nature, there will be less need for\r\nmedication, and the longevity of our race be increased with but little\r\ndread by mankind for that terrible monster consumption, which seems to have\r\nnow unbounded control.\r\n\r\nWhen this theory I have here given you to-night is fully comprehended by\r\nthe medical world and taught the public, together with the kind of foods\r\nnecessary for every one in their respective occupation, location, and\r\nclimate, we may expect a vast change in their physical condition and a hope\r\nfor the future which will brighten as time advances.\r\n\r\nI herewith attach the sphygmographic tracings made upon myself by another,\r\nshowing the state of the pulse as compared with the progress of the\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\nSphygmographic tracings of the pulse of the essayist.

It was agreed. All being in readiness, the lady turned\r\non as she supposed the gas, and the Mexican patient was ordered to breathe\r\nas fast as possible to make sure of the full effect and no doubt of the\r\nfinal success. The assistant was about to extract, but the wife insisted on\r\nhis breathing more rapidly, whereupon the patient was observed to become\r\nvery dark or purple in the face, which satisfied the lady that the\r\nfull effect was manifested, and the tooth was extracted, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of all concerned. While the gas was being taken by the Mexican\r\nthe gasometer was noticed to rise higher and higher as the patient breathed\r\nfaster, and not to sink as was usual when the gas had been previously\r\nadministered. This led to an investigation of the reason of such an\r\nanomalous result, when to their utter surprise they found the valve was so\r\nturned by the wife that the Mexican had been breathing nothing but common\r\nair, and instead of exhaling into the surrounding air he violently forced\r\nit into the gasometer with the nitrous oxide gas, causing it to rise and\r\nnot sink, which it should have done had the valve been properly turned by\r\nthe passage of gas into the lungs of the patient.\r\n\r\nNo more beautiful and positive trial could happen, and might not again by\r\naccident or inadvertence happen again in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAP FOR EFFERVESCING LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a bottle of any liquor charged with carbonic acid under strong\r\npressure, such as champagne, sparkling cider, seltzer water, etc., is\r\nuncorked, the contents often escape with considerable force, flow out, and\r\nare nearly all lost. Besides this, the noise made by the popping of the\r\ncork is not agreeable to most persons. To remedy these inconveniences\r\nthere has been devised the simple apparatus which we represent in the\r\naccompanying cut, taken from _La Nature_. The device consists of a hollow,\r\nsharp-pointed tube, having one or two apertures in its upper extremity\r\nwhich are kept closed by a hollow piston fitting in the interior of the\r\ntube. This tube, or \"tap,\" as it may be called, is supported on a firm base\r\nto which is attached a draught tube, and a small lever for actuating the\r\npiston. After the tap has been thrust through the cork of the bottle of\r\nliquor the contents may be drawn in any quantity and as often as wanted by\r\nsimply pressing down the lever with the finger; this operation raises the\r\npiston so that its apertures correspond with those in the sides of the top,\r\nand the liquid thus finds access to the draught tube through the interior\r\nof the piston. By removing the pressure the piston descends and thus closes\r\nthe vents. By means of this apparatus, then, the contents of any bottle of\r\neffervescing liquids may be as easily drawn off as are those contained in\r\nthe ordinary siphon bottles in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAP FOR EFFERVESCING LIQUIDS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SOCIETY, LONDON, JAN. 20, 1881.\r\n\r\nPROF. H.E. ROSCOE, President, in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vivian Lewes read a paper on \"_Pentathionic Acid_.\" In March last the\r\nauthor, at the suggestion of Dr. Debus, undertook an investigation of\r\npentathionic acid, the existence of which has been denied. The analyses\r\nof the liquid obtained by Wackenroder and others, by passing sulphureted\r\nhydrogen and sulphur dioxide through water, are based on the assumption\r\nthat only one acid is present in the solution, and consequently do not\r\nestablish the existence of pentathionic acid; as, for example, a mixture of\r\none molecule of H_2S_4O_6 and one molecule of H_2S_6O_6 would give the same\r\nanalytical results as H_2S_5O_6. Moreover, no salt of pentathionic acid has\r\nbeen prepared in a pure state. The author has succeeded in preparing barium\r\npentathionate thus: A Wackenroder solution was about half neutralized with\r\nbarium hydrate, filtered, and the clear solution evaporated _in vacuo_ over\r\nsulphuric acid. After eighteen days crystals, which proved to be barium\r\npentathionate + 3 molecules of water, formed. These crystals were\r\nseparated, and the liquid further evaporated, when a second crop was\r\nobtained intermediate in composition between the tetra and pentathionate.\r\nThese were separated, and the mother-liquor on standing deposited some\r\noblong rectangular crystals. These on analysis proved to consist of baric\r\npentathionate with three molecules of water. This salt dissolves readily in\r\ncold water; the solution is decomposed by strong potassic hydrate, baric\r\nsulphite, hyposulphites, and sulphur being formed. By a similar method of\r\nprocedure the author obtained potassium pentathionate, anhydrous, and with\r\none or two molecules of water. The author promises some further results\r\nwith some other salts of the higher thionates.\r\n\r\nThe president said that the society had to thank the author for a very\r\ncomplete research on the subject of pentathionic acid. He, however, begged\r\nto differ from him as to his statements concerning the researches of\r\nMessrs. Takamatsu and Smith; in his opinion these authors had proved the\r\nexistence of pentathionic acid. He hoped that the crystals (which were very\r\nfine) would be measured.\r\n\r\nDr. Debus said that no one had previously been able to make the salts of\r\npentathionic acid, and expressed his sense of the great merit due to the\r\nauthor for his perseverance and success. The paper opened up some highly\r\ninteresting theoretical speculations as to the existence of hexathionic\r\nacid. If potassium tetrathionate was dissolved in water it could be\r\nre-crystallized, but potassium pentathionate under similar circumstances\r\nsplits into sulphur and tetrathionate; but a mixture of tetrathionate and\r\npentathionate can be re-crystallized. It seemed as if the sulphur when\r\neliminated from the pentathionate combined with the tetrathionate.\r\n\r\nDr. Dupré asked Dr. Debus how it was that a molecule of pentathionate could\r\nbe re-crystallized, whereas two molecules of pentathionate, which should,\r\nwhen half decomposed, furnish a molecule of tetra and a molecule of\r\npentathionate, could not.\r\n\r\nDr. Armstrong then read a _\"Preliminary Note on some Hydrocarbons from\r\nRosin Spirit.\"_ After giving an account of our knowledge of rosin spirit,\r\nthe author described the result of the examination of the mixture of\r\nhydrocarbons remaining after heating it with sulphuric acid and diluting\r\nwith half its volume of water and steam distilling. Thus treated rosin\r\nspirit furnishes about one-fourth of its volume of a colorless mobile\r\nliquid, which after long-continued fractional distillation is resolved into\r\na variety of fractions boiling at temperatures from 95° to over 180°. Each\r\nof the fractions was treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, and the\r\nundissolved portions were then re-fractionated. The hydrocarbons dissolved\r\nby the acid were recovered by heating under pressure with hydrochloric\r\nacid. Besides a cymene and a toluene, which have already been shown to\r\nexist in rosin spirit, metaxylene was found to be present. The hydrocarbons\r\ninsoluble in sulphuric acid are, apparently, all members of the C_nH_{2n}\r\nseries; they are not, however, true homologues of ethylene, but hexhydrides\r\nof hydrocarbons of the benzene series. Hexhydro-toluene and probably\r\nhex-hydrometaxylene are present besides the hydrocarbon, C_10H_20, but it\r\nis doubtful if an intermediate term is also present. It is by no means\r\nimprobable, however, that these hydrocarbons are, at least in part,\r\nproducts of the action of the sulphuric acid. Cahours and Kraemer's and\r\nGodzki's observations on the higher fractions of crude wood spirit, in\r\nfact, furnish a precedent for this view. Referring to the results obtained\r\nby Anderson, Tilden, and Renard, the author suggests that rosin spirit\r\nperhaps contains hydrides intermediate in composition between those of\r\nthe C_nH_{2n-6} and C_nH_{2n} series, also derived like the latter from\r\nhydrocarbons of the benzene series. Finally, Dr Armstrong mentioned that\r\nthe volatile portion of the distillate from the non-volatile product of the\r\noxidation of oil of turpentine in moist air furnishes ordinary cymene when\r\ntreated in the manner above described. The fact that rosin spirit yields a\r\ndifferent cymene is, he considers, an argument against the view which\r\nhas more than once been put forward, that rosin is directly derived from\r\nterpene. Probably resin and turpentine, though genetically related, are\r\nproducts of distinct processes.\r\n\r\nThe next paper was _\"On the Determination of the Relative Weight of Single\r\nMolecules,\"_ by E. Vogel, of San Francisco. This paper, which was taken as\r\nread, consists of a lengthy theoretical disquisition, in which the author\r\nmaintains the following propositions: That the combining weights of all\r\nelements are one third of their present values; the assumption that equal\r\nvolumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules does not hold good;\r\nthat the present theory of valency is not supported by chemical facts, and\r\nthat its elimination would be no small gain for chemistry in freeing it\r\nof an element full of mystery, uncertainty, and complication; that the\r\ndistinction between atoms and molecules will no longer be necessary;\r\nthat the facts of specific heat do not lend any support to the theory of\r\nvalency. The paper concludes as follows: \"The cause of chemical action is\r\nundoubtedly atmospheric pressure, which under ordinary conditions is equal\r\nto the weight of 76 cubic centimeters of mercury, one of which equals 6.145\r\nmercury molecules, so that the whole pressure equals 467 mercury molecules.\r\nThis force--which with regard to its chemical effect on molecules can be\r\nmultiplied by means of heat--is amply sufficient to bring about the highest\r\ndegree of molecular specific gravity by the reduction of the molecular\r\nvolumes. To it all molecules are exposed and subjected unalterably, and\r\nif not accepted as the cause of chemical action, its influence has to be\r\neliminated to allow the introduction and display of other forces.\"\r\n\r\nThe next communication was _\"On the Synthetical Production of Ammonia,\r\nby the Combination of Hydrogen and Nitrogen in Presence of Heated Spongy\r\nPlatinum (Preliminary Notice),\"_ by G. S. Johnson. Some experiments, in\r\nwhich pure nitrogen was passed over heated copper containing occluded\r\nhydrogen, suggested to the author the possibility of the formation of\r\nammonia; only minute traces were formed. On passing, however, a mixture of\r\npure nitrogen (from ammonium nitrite) and hydrogen over spongy platinum at\r\na low red heat, abundant evidence was obtained of the synthesis of ammonia.\r\nThe gases were passed, before entering the tube containing the platinum,\r\nthrough a potash bulb containing Nessler reagent, which remained colorless.\r\nOn the contrary, the gas issuing from the platinum rapidly turned Nessler\r\nreagent brown, and in a few minutes turned faintly acid litmus solution\r\nblue; the odor of NH_3 was also perceptible. In one experiment 0.0144\r\ngramme of ammonia was formed in two hours and a half. The author promises\r\nfurther experiment as to the effect of temperature, rate of the gaseous\r\ncurrent, and substitution of palladium for platinum. The author synthesized\r\nsome ammonia before the Society with complete success.\r\n\r\nThe President referred to the synthesis of ammonia from its elements\r\nrecently effected by Donkin, and remarked that apparently the ammonia was\r\nformed in much larger quantities by the process proposed by the author of\r\nthe present paper.\r\n\r\nMr. Warington suggested that some HCl gas should be simultaneously passed\r\nwith the nitrogen and hydrogen, and that the temperature of the spongy\r\nplatinum should be kept just below the temperature at which NH_3\r\ndissociates, in order to improve the yield of NH_3.\r\n\r\n_\"On the Oxidation of Organic Matter in Water\"_ by A. Downes. The author\r\nconsiders that the mere presence of oxygen in contact with the organic\r\nmatter has but little oxidizing action unless lowly organisms, as bacteria,\r\netc. be simultaneously present. Sunlight has apparently considerable\r\neffect in promoting the oxidation of organic matter. The author quotes the\r\nfollowing experiment: A sample of river water was filtered through paper.\r\nIt required per 10,000 parts 0.236 oxygen as permanganate. A second portion\r\nwas placed in a flask plugged with cotton wool, and exposed to sunlight for\r\na week; it then required 0.200. A third portion after a week, but excluded\r\nfrom light, required 0.231. A fourth was boiled for five minutes, plugged,\r\nand then exposed to sunlight for a week; required 0.198. In a second\r\nexperiment with well water a similar result was obtained; more organic\r\nmatter was oxidized when the organisms had been killed by the addition of\r\nsulphuric acid than when the original water was allowed to stand for an\r\nequal length of time. The author also discusses the statement made by Dr.\r\nFrankland that there is less ground for assuming that the organized and\r\nliving matter of sewage is oxidized in a flow of twelve miles of a river\r\nthan for assuming that dead organic matter is oxidized in a similar\r\nflow.--_Chem. News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE OIL, OR OTTO OF ROSES.\r\n\r\nBy CHARLES G. WARNFORD LOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis celebrated perfume is the volatile essential oil distilled from the\r\nflowers of some varieties of rose. The botany of roses appears to be in a\r\ntransition and somewhat unsatisfactory state. Thus the otto-yielding rose\r\nis variously styled _Rosa damascena, R. sempervirens, R. moschata, R.\r\ngallica, R. centifolia, R. provincialis_. It is pretty generally agreed\r\nthat the kind grown for its otto in Bulgaria in the damask rose (_R.\r\ndamascena_), a variety induced by long cultivation, as it is not to be\r\nfound wild. It forms a bush, usually three to four feet, but sometimes six\r\nfeet high; its flowers are of moderate size, semi-double, and arranged\r\nseveral on a branch, though not in clusters or bunches. In color, they are\r\nmostly light-red; some few are white, and said to be less productive of\r\notto.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the delicious perfume of the rose was attempted, with\r\nmore or less success, long prior to the comparatively modern process of\r\ndistilling its essential oil. The early methods chiefly in vogue were the\r\ndistillation of rose-water, and the infusion of roses in olive oil, the\r\nlatter flourishing in Europe generally down to the last century, and\r\nsurviving at the present day in the South of France. The butyraceous oil\r\nproduced by the distillation of roses for making rose-water in this country\r\nis valueless as a perfume; and the real otto was scarcely known in British\r\ncommerce before the present century.\r\n\r\nThe profitable cultivation of roses for the preparation of otto is limited\r\nchiefly by climatic conditions. The odoriferous constitutent of the otto\r\nis a liquid containing oxygen, the solid hydrocarbon or stearoptene, with\r\nwhich it is combined, being absolutely devoid of perfume. The proportion\r\nwhich this inodorous solid constituents bears to the liquid perfume\r\nincreases with the unsuitability of the climate, varying from about 18 per\r\ncent. in Bulgarian oil, to 35 and even 68 per cent. in rose oils distilled\r\nin France and England. This increase in the proportion of stearoptene is\r\nalso shown by the progressively heightened fusing-point of rose oils from\r\ndifferent sources: thus, while Bulgarian oil fuses at about 61° to 64°\r\nFahr., an Indian sample required 68° Fahr.; one from the South of France,\r\n70° to 73° Fahr.; one from Paris, 84° Fahr.; and one obtained in making\r\nrose-water in London, 86° to 89½° Fahr. Even in the Bulgarian oil, a\r\nnotable difference is observed between that produced on the hills and that\r\nfrom the lowlands.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that the culture of roses, and extraction\r\nof their perfume, should have originated in the East. Persia produced\r\nrose-water at an early date, and the town of Nisibin, north-west of Mosul,\r\nwas famous for it in the 14th century. Shiraz, in the 17th century,\r\nprepared both rose water and otto, for export to other parts of Persia, as\r\nwell as all over India. The Perso-Indian trade in rose oil, which continued\r\nto possess considerable importance in the third quarter of the 18th\r\ncentury, is declining, and has nearly disappeared; but the shipments of\r\nrose-water still maintain a respectable figure. The value, in rupees, of\r\nthe exports of rose-water from Bushire in 1879, were--4,000 to India, 1,500\r\nto Java, 200 to Aden and the Red Sea, 1,000 to Muscat and dependencies, 200\r\nto Arab coast of Persian Gulf and Bahrein, 200 to Persian coast and Mekran,\r\nand 1,000 to Zanzibar. Similar statistics relating to Lingah, in the same\r\nyear, show--Otto: 400 to Arab coast of Persian Gulf, and Bahrein; and 250\r\nto Persian coast and Mekran. And Bahrein--Persian Otto: 2,200 to Koweit,\r\nBusrah, and Bagdad. Rose-water: 200 to Arab coast of Persian Gulf, and\r\n1,000 to Koweit, Busrah, and Bagdad.\r\n\r\nIndia itself has a considerable area devoted to rose-gardens, as at\r\nGhazipur, Lahore, Amritzur, and other places, the kind of rose being _R.\r\ndamascena_, according to Brandis. Both rose-water and otto are produced.\r\nThe flowers are distilled with double their weight of water in clay stills;\r\nthe rose-water (_goolabi pani_) thus obtained is placed in shallow vessels,\r\ncovered with moist muslin to keep out dust and flies, and exposed all night\r\nto the cool air, or fanned. In the morning, the film of oil, which has\r\ncollected on the top, is skimmed off by a feather, and transferred to a\r\nsmall phial. This is repeated for several nights, till almost the whole of\r\nthe oil has separated. The quantity of the product varies much, and three\r\ndifferent authorities give the following figures: (_a_) 20,000 roses to\r\nmake 1 rupee's weight (176 gr.) of otto; (_b_) 200,000 to make the same\r\nweight; (_c_) 1,000 roses afford less than 2 gr. of otto. The color ranges\r\nfrom green to bright-amber, and reddish. The oil (otto) is the most\r\ncarefully bottled; the receptacles are hermetically sealed with wax, and\r\nexposed to the full glare of the sun for several days. Rose water deprived\r\nof otto is esteemed much inferior to that which has not been so treated.\r\nWhen bottled, it is also exposed to the sun for a fortnight at least.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean countries of Africa enter but feebly into this industry,\r\nand it is a little remarkable that the French have not cultivated it in\r\nAlgeria. Egypt's demand for rose-water and rose-vinegar is supplied from\r\nMedinet Fayum, south-west of Cairo. Tunis has also some local reputation\r\nfor similar products. Von Maltzan says that the rose there grown for otto\r\nis the dog-rose (_R. canina_), and that it is extremely fragrant, 20 lb.\r\nof the flower yielding about 1 dr. of otto. Genoa occasionally imports a\r\nlittle of this product, which is of excellent quality. In the south of\r\nFrance rose gardens occupy a large share of attention, about Grasse,\r\nCannes, and Nice; they chiefly produce rose-water, much of which is\r\nexported to England. The essence (otto) obtained by the distillation of the\r\nProvence rose (_R. provincialis_) has a characteristic perfume, arising, it\r\nis believed, from the bees transporting the pollen of the orange flowers\r\ninto the petals of the roses. The French otto is richer in stearoptene than\r\nthe Turkish, nine grammes crystallizing in a liter (1¾ pint) of alcohol at\r\nthe same temperature as 18 grammes of the Turkish. The best preparations\r\nare made at Cannes and Grasse. The flowers are not there treated for the\r\notto, but are submitted to a process of maceration in fat or oil, ten\r\nkilos. of roses being required to impregnate one kilo. of fat. The price of\r\nthe roses varies from 50c. to 1 fr. 25c. per kilo.\r\n\r\nBut the one commercially important source of otto of roses is a\r\ncircumscribed patch of ancient Thrace or modern Bulgaria, stretching along\r\nthe southern slopes of the central Balkans, and approximately included\r\nbetween the 25th and 26th degrees of east longitude, and the 42d and 43d of\r\nnorth latitude. The chief rose-growing districts are Philippopoli, Chirpan,\r\nGiopcu, Karadshah-Dagh, Kojun-Tepe, Eski-Sara, Jeni-Sara, Bazardshik, and\r\nthe center and headquarters of the industry, Kazanlik (Kisanlik),\r\nsituated in a beautiful undulating plain, in the valley of the Tunja. The\r\nproductiveness of the last-mentioned district may be judged from the fact\r\nthat, of the 123 Thracian localities carrying on the preparation of otto in\r\n1877--they numbered 140 in 1859--42 belong to it. The only place affording\r\notto on the northern side of the Balkans is Travina. The geological\r\nformation throughout is syenite, the decomposition of which has provided a\r\nsoil so fertile as to need but little manuring. The vegetation, according\r\nto Baur, indicates a climate differing but slightly from that of the Black\r\nForest, the average summer temperatures being stated at 82° Fahr. at noon,\r\nand 68° Fahr. in the evening. The rose-bushes nourish best and live longest\r\non sandy, sun-exposed (south and south-east aspect) slopes. The flowers\r\nproduced by those growing on inclined ground are dearer and more esteemed\r\nthan any raised on level land, being 50 per cent. richer in oil, and that\r\nof a stronger quality. This proves the advantage of thorough drainage. On\r\nthe other hand, plantations at high altitudes yield less oil, which is of a\r\ncharacter that readily congeals, from an insufficiency of summer heat. The\r\ndistricts lying adjacent to and in the mountains are sometimes visited\r\nby hard frosts, which destroy or greatly reduce the crop. Floods also\r\noccasionally do considerable damage. The bushes are attacked at intervals\r\nand in patches by a blight similar to that which injures the vines of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe bushes are planted in hedge-like rows in gardens and fields, at\r\nconvenient distances apart, for the gathering of the crop. They are seldom\r\nmanured. The planting takes place in spring and autumn; the flowers attain\r\nperfection in April and May, and the harvest lasts from May till the\r\nbeginning of June. The expanded flowers are gathered before sunrise,\r\noften with the calyx attached; such as are not required for immediate\r\ndistillation are spread out in cellars, but all are treated within the day\r\non which they are plucked. Baur states that, if the buds develop slowly,\r\nby reason of cool damp weather, and are not much exposed to sun-heat, when\r\nabout to be collected, a rich yield of otto, having a low solidifying\r\npoint, is the result, whereas, should the sky be clear and the temperature\r\nhigh at or shortly before the time of gathering, the product is diminished\r\nand is more easily congealable. Hanbury, on the contrary, when distilling\r\nroses in London, noticed that when they had been collected on fine dry\r\ndays the rose-water had most volatile oil floating upon it, and that, when\r\ngathered in cool rainy weather, little or no volatile oil separated.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are not salted, nor subjected to any other treatment, before\r\nbeing conveyed in baskets, on the heads of men and women and backs of\r\nanimals, to the distilling apparatus. This consists of a tinned-copper\r\nstill, erected on a semicircle of bricks, and heated by a wood fire; from\r\nthe top passes a straight tin pipe, which obliquely traverses a tub kept\r\nconstantly filled with cold water, by a spout, from some convenient\r\nrivulet, and constitutes the condenser. Several such stills are usually\r\nplaced together, often beneath the shade of a large tree. The still is\r\ncharged with 25 to 50 lb. of roses, not previously deprived of their\r\ncalyces, and double the volume of spring water. The distillation is carried\r\non for about l½ hours, the result being simply a very oily rose-water\r\n(_ghyul suyu_). The exhausted flowers are removed from the still, and the\r\ndecoction is used for the next distillation, instead of fresh water.\r\nThe first distillates from each apparatus are mixed and distilled by\r\nthemselves, one-sixth being drawn off; the residue replaces spring water\r\nfor subsequent operations. The distillate is received in long-necked\r\nbottles, holding about 1¼ gallon. It is kept in them for a day or two, at a\r\ntemperature exceeding 59° Fahr., by which time most of the oil, fluid\r\nand bright, will have reached the surface. It is skimmed off by a small,\r\nlong-handled, fine-orificed tin funnel, and is then ready for sale. The\r\nlast-run rose-water is extremely fragrant, and is much prized locally for\r\nculinary and medicinal purposes. The quantity and quality of the otto are\r\nmuch influenced by the character of the water used in distilling. When\r\nhard spring water is employed, the otto is rich in stearoptene, but less\r\ntransparent and fragrant. The average quantity of the product is estimated\r\nby Baur at 0.037 to 0.040 per cent.; another authority says that 3,200\r\nkilos. of roses give 1 kilo. of oil.\r\n\r\nPure otto, carefully distilled, is at first colorless, but speedily becomes\r\nyellowish; its specific gravity is 0.87 at 72.5° Fahr.; its boiling-point\r\nis 444° Fahr.; it solidifies at 51.8° to 60.8° Fahr., or still higher; it\r\nis soluble in absolute alcohol, and in acetic acid. The most usual and\r\nreliable tests of the quality of an otto are (1) its odor, (2) its\r\ncongealing point, (3) its crystallization. The odor can be judged only\r\nafter long experience. A good oil should congeal well in five minutes at\r\na temperature of 54.5° Fahr.; fraudulent additions lower the congealing\r\npoint. The crystals of rose-stearoptene are light, feathery, shining\r\nplates, filling the whole liquid. Almost the only material used for\r\nartificially heightening the apparent proportion of stearoptene is said to\r\nbe spermaceti, which is easily recognizable from its liability to settle\r\ndown in a solid cake, and from its melting at 122° Fahr., whereas\r\nstearoptene fuses at 91.4° Fahr. Possibly paraffin wax would more easily\r\nescape detection.\r\n\r\nThe adulterations by means of other essential oils are much more difficult\r\nof discovery, and much more general; in fact, it is said that none of the\r\nBulgarian otto is completely free from this kind of sophistication. The\r\noils employed for the purpose are certain of the grass oils (_Andropogon_\r\nand _Cymbopogon spp._) notably that afforded by _Andropogon, Schoenanthus_\r\ncalled _idris-yaghi_ by the Turks, and commonly known to Europeans as\r\n\"geranium oil,\" though quite distinct from true geranium oil. The addition\r\nis generally made by sprinkling it upon the rose-leaves before distilling.\r\nIt is largely produced in the neighborhood of Delhi, and exported to\r\nTurkey by way of Arabia. It is sold by Arabs in Constantinople in large\r\nbladder-shaped tinned-copper vessels, holding about 120 lb. As it is\r\nusually itself adulterated with some fatty oil, it needs to undergo\r\npurification before use. This is effected in the following manner: The\r\ncrude oil is repeatedly shaken up with water acidulated with lemon-juice,\r\nfrom which it is poured off after standing for a day. The washed oil\r\nis placed in shallow saucers, well exposed to sun and air, by which it\r\ngradually loses its objectionable odor. Spring and early summer are the\r\nbest seasons for the operation, which occupies two to four weeks, according\r\nto the state of the weather and the quality of the oil. The general\r\ncharacters of this oil are so similar to those of otto of roses--even the\r\nodor bearing a distant resemblance--that their discrimination when mixed is\r\na matter of practical impossibility. The ratio of the adulteration varies\r\nfrom a small figure up to 80 or 90 per cent. The only safeguard against\r\ndeception is to pay a fair price, and to deal with firms of good repute,\r\nsuch as Messrs. Papasoglu, Manoglu & Son, Ihmsen & Co., and Holstein & Co.\r\nin Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe otto is put up in squat-shaped flasks of tinned copper, called\r\n_kunkumas_, holding from 1 to 10 lb., and sewn up in white woolen cloths.\r\nUsually their contents are transferred at Constantinople into small gilded\r\nbottles of German manufacture for export. The Bulgarian otto harvest,\r\nduring the five years 1867-71, was reckoned to average somewhat below\r\n400,000 _meticals, miskals_, or _midkals_ (of about 3 dwt. troy), or 4,226\r\nlb. av.; that of 1873, which was good, was estimated at 500,000, value\r\nabout £700,000. The harvest of 1880 realized more than £1,000,000, though\r\nthe roses themselves were not so valuable as in 1876. About 300,000\r\n_meticals_ of otto, valued at £932,077, were exported in 1876 from\r\nPhilippopolis, chiefly to France, Australia, America, and Germany.\r\n\r\n--_Jour.
