The coral sand, blazing white under the full\r\n     glare of the sun, lifts in the right foreground to a long hummuck a\r\n     few feet above sea-level. A stunted coco palm rises from the center\r\n     of this elevation, its bunch of scraggly leaves drooping\r\n     motionlessly, casting a small circular patch of shadow directly\r\n     beneath on the ground about the trunk. About a hundred yards in the\r\n     distance the lagoon is seen, its vivid blue contrasting with the\r\n     white coral beach which borders its circular outline. The far\r\n     horizon to seaward is marked by a broad band of purplish haze which\r\n     separates the bright blue of the water from the metallic grey-blue\r\n     of the sky. The island bakes. The intensity of the sun’s rays is\r\n     flung back skyward in a quivering mist of heat-waves which distorts\r\n     the outlines of things, giving the visible world an intangible\r\n     eerie quality, as if it were floating submerged in some colorless\r\n     molten fluid._\r\n\r\n     _As the curtain rises_, ABEL _is discovered lying asleep, curled\r\n     up in the patch of shade beneath the coco palm. He is a runty,\r\n     under-sized boy of fifteen, with a shrivelled old face, tanned to\r\n     parchment by the sum. He has on a suit of dirty dungarees, man’s\r\n     size, much too large for him, which hang in loose folds from his\r\n     puny frame. A thatch of brown hair straggles in limp wisps from\r\n     under the peaked canvas cap he wears. He looks terribly exhausted.\r\n     His dreams are evidently fraught with terror, for he twitches\r\n     convulsively and moans with fright._ BUTLER _enters hurriedly,\r\n     panting, from the right, rear. He is a tall man of over middle age,\r\n     dressed in the faded remainder of what was once a brown suit. The\r\n     coat, the buttons of which have been torn off, hangs open,\r\n     revealing his nakedness beneath. A cloth cap covers his bald head,\r\n     with its halo of dirty thin grey hair. His body is emaciated. His\r\n     face, with its round, blue eyes, is weathered and cracked by the\r\n     sun’s rays. The wreck of a pair of heavy shoes flop about his bare\r\n     feet. He looks back cautiously, as if he were afraid of being\r\n     followed; then satisfied that he is not, he approaches the sleeping\r\n     boy, and bending down, puts his hand on_ ABEL’S _forehead_. ABEL\r\n     _groans and opens his eyes. He stares about furtively, as if\r\n     seeking someone whose presence he dreads to find._\r\n\r\nABEL--[_In a husky voice._] Where’s Capt’n and the rest, Butts?\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_In a hoarse, cracked whisper._]--On the beach--down there.\r\n[_He makes an exhausted gesture, right, and then sinks with a groan at\r\nthe foot of the tree, leaning back against the trunk, trying vainly to\r\nhunch his long legs up so as to be completely in the shade._]\r\n\r\nABEL--What’re they doin’? [_With avid eyes._] They ain’t found no water\r\nyet?\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Shaking his head, his eyes closing wearily._] No. How would\r\nthey--when there ain’t any--not on this devil’s island--dry as a bone,\r\nmy sonny--sand and sun--that’s all.\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Remonstratingly--his lips trembling a little._] Aw--maybe--you\r\ndon’t know no different.\r\n\r\nBUTLER--No. Might as well look the devil in the face, sonny. There’s no\r\nwater here. Not a damn drop. No--nor a scrap to eat, neither. Only the\r\ndamn sun. [_Weakly--touching the skin of his face with trembling\r\nfingers._] God! My face is like the raw inside of a wet hide! If it’d\r\nonly rain! [_After a pause--kindly._] But how are you, eh? Had a good\r\nsleep?\r\n\r\nABEL--I was dreamin’ awful. [_With a sudden, shrill agony--his lips\r\ntwitching._] I need a drink of water--something awful! My mouth’s\r\nburnin’ up. [_With tremulous pleading._] Say, ain’t you got ’nother\r\ndrink left?--honest, ain’t you?\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Looking around him cautiously._] Not so loud! [_Fixing his\r\neyes sternly on the boy._] This is a dead secret, mind! You’ll swear you\r\nwon’t blab--not to him?\r\n\r\nABEL--Sure, Butts, sure! Gawd strike me dead!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Takes a pint bottle from the hip-pocket of his pants. It is\r\nabout half full of water._] He don’t know I’ve got this, remember!\r\nHe--and the rest--they’d kill me like a dog--and you too,\r\nsonny--remember that!\r\n\r\nABEL--Sure! I ain’t goin’ to tell ’em, Butts. [_Stretching out his hands\r\nfrenziedly._] Aw, give it to me, Butts! Give me a drink, for Christ’s\r\nsake!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--No, you don’t! I’ll hold it for you. Only a few drops. You’d\r\nhave it all down your throat. And we’ve got to be careful. It’s got to\r\nlast ’til the ship comes past that’ll pick us up. That’s the only hope.\r\n[_Holding the bottle at arm’s length from the boy._] Hands down, now--or\r\nyou don’t get a drop! [_The boy lets his hands drop to his sides._\r\nBUTLER _puts the bottle carefully to his lips, and allows the boy two\r\ngulps--then snatches it away_.] That’s all now. More later. [_He takes\r\none gulp himself, and making a tremendous effort of will, jerks the\r\nbottle from his lips, and corking it quickly, thrusts it back in his\r\npocket and heaves a shuddering sigh._]\r\n\r\nABEL--Aw, more! Just another swaller----\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Determinedly._] No!\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Crying weakly._] Yuh dirty mut!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Quietly._] There! Don’t get riled. It only makes you\r\nhotter--and thirstier. [_The boy sinks back exhausted and closes his\r\neyes._ BUTLER _begins to talk in a more assured voice, as if the sip of\r\nwater had renewed his courage_.] That’ll save us yet, that bit of water.\r\nA lucky notion of mine to think of it--at the last moment. They were\r\njust lowering the boots. I could hear you calling to me to hurry and\r\ncome. They didn’t care if I went down with that stinking whaling ship or\r\nnot, damn them! What did the dirty cook matter to them? But I thought of\r\nfilling this bottle. It’d been lying there in the galley for two years\r\nalmost. I’d had it on my hip, full of whiskey, that night in Oakland\r\nwhen I was shanghied. So I filled it out of a bucket before I ran to the\r\nboat. Lucky I did, son--for you and me--not for them--damn ’em!\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Struggling to a sitting posture, evidently strengthened by his\r\ndrink._] Gee if the Old Man was wise you got it----\r\n\r\nBUTLER--He won’t know--nor Horne, nor Cates, nor Jimmy Kanaka, neither.\r\n[_As if in self-justification._] Why should I tell ’em, eh? Did I ever\r\nget anything better than a kick or a curse from one of them?\r\n[_Vindictively._] Would they give it to me if they had it? They’d see me\r\nin hell first! And besides, it’s too late for them. They’re mad as\r\nhatters right now, the four of them. They ain’t had a drop since three\r\nnights back, when the water in the cask gave out and we rowed up against\r\nthis island in the dark. Think of it, and them out walking and roasting\r\nin the sun all day, looking for water where there ain’t any. Wouldn’t\r\nyou be crazy? [_Suddenly he laughs queerly._] Didn’t you hear them\r\nshouting and yelling like lunatics just before I came?\r\n\r\nABEL--I thought I heard something--on’y maybe I was dreamin’.\r\n\r\nBUTLER--It’s them that are doing the dreaming. I was with them. I had to\r\ngo. [_With rising anger._] He kicked me awake--and every time I tried to\r\nget away he beat me back. He’s strong yet--[_With threatening\r\nvindictiveness._]--but he can’t last long, damn him! [_Controlling\r\nhimself, goes on with his story excitedly._] Well, we went looking for\r\nwater--on this sand pile. Then Jimmy Kanaka saw a boat sunk half under\r\ndown inside the reef--a Malay canoe, only bigger. They got down in her\r\nthe best way they could, up to their waists in water. They thought there\r\nmight be something to drink on her. I was trying to sneak off, scared to\r\ngo in on account of sharks. All of a sudden they gave an awful yell. I\r\nthought they’d found something to drink and ran back. They was all\r\nstanding about a box they’d forced open, yelling and cursing and out of\r\ntheir heads completely. When I looked I seen the box was full of all\r\nsorts of metal junk--bracelets and bands and necklaces that I guess the\r\nMalays wear. Nothing but brass and copper, and bum imitations of\r\ndiamonds and things--not worth a dam; and there they were, shouting with\r\njoy and slapping each other on the back. And that hellion of a skipper\r\nshouts at me: “Get out of this! No share here for a stinking cook!” he\r\nyells. I didn’t say nothing but just picked up some of the stuff to make\r\nsure. Then I told him straight. “This ain’t gold. It’s brass and\r\ncopper--not worth a damn.” God, he got wild! I had to run, or he’d\r\nknifed me--then and there. That was when I woke you up.\r\n\r\nABEL--And ain’t it worth nothin’, honest? How’d you know it ain’t?\r\n\r\nBUTLER--D’you think I ain’t learned to know gold in my time? And\r\npolished enough copper and brass to know them, too? Just as if it was\r\ngold it’d do ’em any good! You can’t drink gold, can you? [_With sudden\r\nviolence._] It serves ’em right, all that’s happened and going to\r\nhappen. Kicks and smacks in the face if I even winked an eye--two years\r\nof it! And me shanghied when I was drunk--taken away from a good job and\r\nforced to cook the swill on a rotten whaler. Oh, I’ll pay him back for\r\nit! His damn ship is wrecked and lost to him--that’s the first of it.\r\nI’ll see him rot and die--and the three with him! But you and me’ll be\r\nsaved! D’you know why I’ve let you go halves on this water, instead of\r\nhogging it all myself? It’s because you were the only one on board that\r\ndidn’t treat me like a dog--and they kicked and beat you, too. We were\r\nin the same boat. And now we’ll get even! Them and their dirty box of\r\njunk! [_He sinks back, exhausted by this outburst_.]\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Suddenly, in a piteous voice._] Gee, I wisht I was back home\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--You’ll get back. We both will. [_He closes his eyes. After a\r\npause--weakly._] When I close my eyes, everything gets to rocking under\r\nme, like I was in that open boat again. I won’t forget these four days\r\nin a hurry. Up and down---- Nothing but sun and water. [_They are both\r\nsilent, leaning with closed eyes against the bole of the tree, panting\r\nexhaustedly. A murmur of men’s voices comes from the right, rear, and\r\ngradually get nearer._]\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Opening his eyes with a start._] Butts! I hear ’em comin’!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Listening, wide-eyed, for a moment._] Yes, it’s them. [_He\r\ngets to his feet weakly._] Come, let’s get out of this. [ABEL _staggers\r\nto his feet. They both move to the left._ BUTLER _shades his eyes with\r\nhis hands and looks toward the beach_.] Look! They’re dragging along\r\nthat box of junk with ’em, the damn fools! [_Warningly._] They’re crazy\r\nas hell. Don’t give ’em no chance to pick on you, d’you hear? They’d\r\nstop at nothing when they’re this way. [_There is a scuffling of heavy\r\nfootsteps in the sand, and_ CAPTAIN BARTLETT _appears, followed by_\r\nHORNE, _who in turn is followed by_ CATES _and_ JIMMY KANAKA. BARTLETT\r\n_is a tall, huge-framed figure of a man, dressed in a blue\r\ndouble-breasted coat, pants of the same material, and rubber sea-boots\r\nturned down from the knees. In spite of the ravages of hunger and thirst\r\nthere is still a suggestion of immense strength in his heavy-muscled\r\nbody. His head is massive, thickly covered with tangled, iron-grey hair.\r\nHis face is large, bony, and leather-tanned, with a long aquiline nose\r\nand a gash of a mouth shadowed by a bristling grey mustache. His broad\r\njaw sticks out at an angle of implacable stubbornness. Bushy grey brows\r\noverhang the obsessed glare of his sombre dark eyes._ SILAS HORNE _is a\r\nthin, parrot-nosed, angular old man, his lean face marked by a life-time\r\nof crass lusts and mean cruelty. He is dressed in grey cotton trousers,\r\nand a singlet torn open across his hairy chest. The exposed skin of his\r\narms and shoulders and chest has been blistered and seared by the sun. A\r\ncap is on his head._ CATES _is squat and broad-chested, with thick,\r\nstumpy legs and arms. His square, stupid face, with its greedy pig’s\r\neyes, is terribly pock-marked. He is gross and bestial, an unintelligent\r\nbrute. He is dressed in dungaree pants and a dirty white sailor’s\r\nblouse, and wears a brown cap._ JIMMY KANAKA _is a tall, sinewy, bronzed\r\nyoung Islander. He wears only a loin cloth and a leather belt with a\r\nsheath-knife. The last two are staggering beneath the weight of a heavy\r\ninlaid chest. The eyes of the three white men are wild. They pant\r\nexhaustedly, their legs trembling with weakness beneath them. Their lips\r\nare puffed and cracked, their voices muffled by their swollen tongues.\r\nBut there is a mad air of happiness, of excitement, about their scorched\r\nfaces._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In a crooning, monotonous voice._] It’s heavy, I know,\r\nheavy--that chest. Up, bullies! Up with her! [_He flings himself in the\r\nshade, resting his back against the tree, and points to the sand at his\r\nfeet._] Put ’er there, bullies--there where I kin see!\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Echoing his words mechanically._] Put’er there!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_In thick, stupid tones._] Aye-aye, sir! Down she goes, Jimmy!\r\n[_They set the chest down._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Sit down, lads, sit down. Ye’ve earned your spell of rest.\r\n[_The three men throw themselves on the sand in attitudes of spent\r\nweariness. Bartlett’s eyes are fixed gloatingly on the chest. There is a\r\nsilence suddenly broken by Cates, who leaps to a kneeling position with\r\na choked cry._]\r\n\r\nCATES--[_His eyes staring at the Captain with fierce insistence._] I\r\nwant a drink--water! [_The others are startled into a rigid, dazzed\r\nattention._ HORNE’S _lips move painfully in a soundless repetition of\r\nthe word. There is a pause. Then Bartlett strikes the side of his head\r\nwith his fist, as if to drive this obsession from his brain._ BUTLER\r\n_and_ ABEL _stand looking at them with frightened eyes_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Having regained control over himself, in a determined voice,\r\ndeep-toned and menacing._] If ye speak that word ever again, Ben\r\nCates--if ye say it once again--ye’ll be food for the sharks! Ye hear?\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Terrified._] Yes, sir. [_He collapses limply on the sand\r\nagain._ HORNE _and the_ KANAKA _relax hopelessly_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With heavy scorn._] Are ye a child to take on like a sick\r\nwoman--cryin’ for what ye know we’ve not got? Can’t ye stand up under a\r\nlittle thirst like a man? [_Resolutely._] There’ll be water enough--if\r\nye’ll wait and keep a stiff upper lip on ye. We’ll all be picked up\r\ntoday. I’ll stake my word on it. This state o’ things can’t last. [_His\r\neyes fall on the chest._] Ye ought to be singin’ ’stead o’ cryin’--after\r\nthe find we’ve made. What’s the lack of water amount to--when ye’ve gold\r\nbefore you? [_With mad exultation._] Gold! Enough of it in your share\r\nalone to buy ye rum, and wine, and women, too, for the rest o’ your\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Straightening up to a sitting posture--his small eyes staring\r\nat the box fascinatedly--in a stupid mumble._] Aye--aye--rum and wine!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Half closing his eyes as if the better to enjoy his\r\nvision._] Yes, rum and wine and women for you and Horne and Jimmy. No\r\nmore hard work on the dirty sea for ye, bullies, but a full pay-day in\r\nyour pockets to spend each day o’ the year. [_The three strain their\r\nears, listening eagerly. Even_ BUTLER _and_ ABEL _advance a step or two\r\ntoward him, as if they, too, were half hypnotized_.] And Cates grumbling\r\nbecause he’s thirsty! I’d be the proper one to complain--if complainin’\r\nthere was to do! Ain’t I lost my ship and the work o’ two years with\r\nher? And what have ye lost, all three, but a few rags o’ clothes? [_With\r\nsavage emphasis._] I tell ye, I be glad the Triton went down! [_He taps\r\nthe box with his fingers._] They’s more in this than ever was earned by\r\nall the whalin’ ships afloat. They’s gold--heavy and solid--and diamonds\r\nand emeralds and rubies!--red and green, they be.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Licking his lips._] Aye, I seen ’em there--and emeralds be\r\ngreen, I know, and sell for a ton of gold!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As if he hadn’t heard and was dreaming out loud to\r\nhimself._] Rum and wine for you three, and rest for me. Aye, I’ll rest\r\nto home ’til the day I die. Aye, woman, I be comin’ home now for good.\r\nAye, Nat and Sue, your father be comin’ home for the rest o’ his life!\r\nNo more stinkin’ blubber on the deck. I’ll give up whalin’ like ye’ve\r\nalways been askin’ me, Sarah. Aye, I’ll go to meetin’ with ye on a\r\nSunday like ye’ve always prayed I would. We’ll make the damn neighbors\r\nopen their eyes, curse ’em! Carriages and silks for ye--they’ll be\r\nnothin’ too good--and for Sue and the boy. I’ve been dreamin’ o’ this in\r\nmy sleep for years. I never give a damn ’bout the oil--that’s just\r\ntrade--but I always hoped on some voyage I’d pick up ambergris--a whole\r\nlot of it--and that’s worth gold!\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_His head bobbing up from his chest--drowsily._] Aye, ambergris!\r\nIt’s costly truck.\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_In a whisper to the boy--cautiously._] There! Wasn’t I right?\r\nMad as hatters, all of ’em! Come on away!\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Staring at the Captain fascinatedly._] No. I wanter see ’em open\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBUTLER--Look out! You’ll be going batty yourself, first thing you know.\r\n[_But he also stays._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His voice more and more that of a somnambulist._] It’s time\r\nI settled down to home with ye, Sarah, after twenty years o’ whalin’.\r\nThey’s plenty o’ big trees on my place, bullies, and shade and green\r\ngrass, and a cool wind off the sea. [_He shakes off the growing\r\ndrowsiness and glares about him in a rage._] Hell’s fire! What crazy\r\ntruck be I thinkin’ of? [_But he and the others sink back immediately\r\ninto stupor. After a pause he begins to relate a tale in a droning\r\nvoice._] Years ago, when I was whalin’ out o’ New Bedford--just after I\r\ngot my first ship, it was--a man come to me--Spanish-looking, he\r\nwas--and wanted to charter my ship and me go shares. He showed me a map\r\no’ some island off the coast of South America somewhere. They was a\r\ncross marked on it where treasure had been buried by the old pirates.\r\nThat was what he said. But I was a fool. I didn’t believe him. I didn’t\r\nsee’s I could take a chance. He got old Scott’s schooner--finally. She\r\nsailed and never was heard o’ since. But I’ve never forgot him and his\r\nmap. And often I’ve thought if I’d ’a’ went that vige---- [_He\r\nstraightens up and shouts with aggressive violence._] But here she be!\r\nRun right into it--without no map nor nothin’. Gold and diamonds and\r\nall--all them things he said was there--there they be in front o’ our\r\neyes! [_To the now alert_ JIMMY.] Open ’er up, Jimmy!\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Getting up--in his soft voice._] Aye, Captain. [_He reaches\r\ndown to lift the lid._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_A sudden change of feeling comes over him, and he knocks_\r\nJIMMY’S _arm aside savagely_.] Hands off, ye dog! I’m takin’ care o’\r\nthis chest, and no man’s hand’s goin’ to touch it but mine!\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Stepping back docilely--in the same unmoved, soft tone._] Aye,\r\nCaptain. [_He squats down to the left of the chest._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Seeming suddenly to notice the cook for the first time._] So\r\nthere you be, eh? [_His voice growing thick with rage._] I ain’t forgot\r\nwhat ye said down by the shore there! Lucky for ye I didn’t catch ye\r\nthen! “Brass and copper--junk,” ye said--“not gold! Not worth a damn,”\r\nye said! Ye blasted son o’ a liar! No share for ye! I’ll not forget.\r\nAnd keep your distance o’ me if ye want your hide! [_Looking at_ ABEL.]\r\nYe’ve been tellin’ that boy your lies too, I kin tell by the look o’\r\nhim. [_Sternly._] Come here, boy!\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Advances with faltering steps._] Y-yes, s-sir?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Open up that chest! Open it up, ye brat! [_With a desperate\r\nmovement of fear_ ABEL _reaches down and flings open the lid of the\r\nchest._ _As he does so_, BARTLETT’S _huge hand fastens on the collar of\r\nhis coat, and holds him with face bent over the box_. HORNE, CATES,\r\n_and_ JIMMY KANAKA _pull themselves close, their necks craning for a\r\nlook inside_. BUTLER _takes a few steps toward them_.]\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_In a low uncertain tone._] Maybe I was wrong, Captain\r\nBartlett, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Shaking the terror-stricken boy._] What d’ye see there, ye\r\nlittle swab? What d’ye see there?\r\n\r\nABEL--Aw--leggo--I’m chokin’!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Grimly._] Ye’ll choke in earnest if ye don’t answer me. What\r\nd’ye see? Is it gold? Answer me--is it gold?\r\n\r\nABEL--[_Stutteringly._] Yes--sure--gold--I see it!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Thrusts him away. The boy staggers and falls to the sand._\r\nBARTLETT _turns to_ BUTLER _triumphantly_.] Ye see, ye liar? Gold!\r\nGold! Even a child can tell it at a look. [_With a sombre menace in his\r\ntone._] But ye--don’t believe--do ye?\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Frightenedly._] Maybe I was wrong, sir. I--didn’t--look very\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Come here! [_He stands up, his back against the tree._] Come\r\nhere!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--Yes, sir. [_But he looks about him shiftily, as if to run\r\naway._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Jimmy! [_The_ KANAKA _leaps to his feet_.] Knife him, Jimmy,\r\nif he tries to run.\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_His hand goes to his knife, his dark eyes lighting up with\r\nsavagery--in his soft voice._] Aye, Captain!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_To the trembling cook._] Come here!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Goes to him with the courage of desperation._] Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Pointing to the contents of the chest._] Is it gold--or not?\r\n\r\nBUTLER--If I can feel of one----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Pick one up.\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Picks up a heavy anklet encrusted with colored glass, looks at\r\nit for a minute--then feigning great assurance._] I was wrong, Captain.\r\nIt’s gold all right enough--worth all kinds of money, I bet.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With mad triumph._] Ha! Ye’ve come to your senses, have ye?\r\nToo late, ye swab! No share for ye! And here’s to teach ye for lyin’ to\r\nme before! [_His fist jerks out from his side, and_ BUTLER _is knocked\r\nsprawling on the sand, where he lies groaning for a moment, the anklet\r\nstill clutched in his hand. The boy gives a gasp of fright and scampers\r\noff, left._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--That’ll learn ye! [_He sits down beside the chest. The others\r\ncrouch close. Bartlett shoves in both of his hands--in a tone of mad\r\ngloating._] Gold! Better’n whaling, ain’t she, boys? Better’n ambergris,\r\neven if I ever had luck to find any! [BUTLER _staggers to his feet. He\r\nexamines the anklet with contemptuous scorn and even bites it to make\r\nsure. Then he edges stealthily toward the left. A sudden transformation\r\ncomes over his face and he glowers at the Captain with hatred, his\r\nfeatures distorted with fury._]\r\n\r\nJIMMY KANAKA--[_Pointing to_ BUTLER.] He got him, Captain!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Glancing at the cook with contemptuous scorn._] Sneakin’\r\naway with that piece o’ the gold, be ye? Ye thievin’ swine! Ye know\r\nright enough it’s gold now, don’t ye? Well, ye kin keep it--for your\r\nshare for speakin’ the truth that once.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_His cupidity protesting._] Don’t give it to him, sir! It’s so\r\nmuch the less for us that worked for it when he did nothin’!\r\n\r\nBUTLER--[_Overcome by hysterical rage--stammering._] Who asked you for\r\nit--eh? Who--wants the dam thing? Not me! No! You damned lunatics! You\r\noughter all be in the asylum? [_Holding the anklet out contemptuously._]\r\nGold? Ha-ha! This junk? I just bit it to make sure. Gold? Brass, that’s\r\nwhat--and pieces of glass! Junk! Not worth a dam. Here! Take it! You can\r\nhave it! [_He flings it on the sand before them._ BARTLETT _snatches it\r\nup protectingly_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In a frenzy._] Jimmy! [_But_ BUTLER _runs off left with a\r\nterrified cry_. JIMMY _springs to his feet and stands with his hand on\r\nhis knife, waiting for a further order_.]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Eagerly._] I go catch--go stick him, Captain?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Pausing--with a frown._] No. They’s time enough for that--if\r\nneed be. Sit down. [JIMMY _sits down again with a childish air of\r\nsulking_. BARTLETT _stares at the treasure, continuing to frown, as if\r\nButler’s action had made him uneasy, bewildered and confused him. He\r\nmutters half to himself._] Queer! Queer! He threw it back as if ’twas a\r\nchunk of mud! He knew--and yet he said he didn’t want it. Junk, he\r\ncalled it--and he knows it’s gold! He said ’twas gold himself a second\r\nback. He’s queer. Why would he say junk when he knows it’s gold? D’ye\r\nthink--he don’t believe?\r\n\r\nHORNE--He was mad because you knocked him down.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Shaking his head grimly._] It ain’t the first time I’ve\r\nknocked him down; but he never spoke up to me--like that--before. No,\r\nit’s somethin’ else is wrong with him--somethin’.\r\n\r\nHORNE--No share for him, you told him sir. That’s what wrong with him.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Again shaking his head._] No. His eyes--It’s somethin’ he’s\r\ngot in his head--somethin’ he’s hidin’! His share--maybe he thinks he’ll\r\nget his share anyway, in spite o’ us! Maybe he thinks his share wouldn’t\r\nbe all he wants! Maybe he thinks we’ll die o’ hunger and thirst before\r\nwe get picked up--and that he’ll live--and then--he’ll come in for the\r\nwhole chestful! [_Suddenly springing to his feet in a rage, convinced\r\nthat he has found the truth._] Hell’s fire! That’s it, bullies! That’s\r\nhis sneakin’ plan! To watch us die--and steal it from us!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Rising to his knees and shaking his hand threateningly above\r\nhis head._] Tell Jimmy to knife him, sir! Tell Jimmy--I ain’t got a\r\nknife, or I’d do it myself. [_He totters weakly to his feet._]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Eagerly._] You speak, I stick him, Captain. I stick boy, too.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Weakening._] I’m weak, but I kin do for him yet. I’m weak----\r\n[_His knees sag under him. He pleads piteously._] If I’d only a drink to\r\nput some strength in me! If I’d only a sup o’ water, I’d do for him!\r\n[_Turning, as if to stagger down toward the beach._] There must be\r\nwater. Let’s look again. I’ll go look---- [_But the effort he makes is\r\ntoo much for his strength and he falls to the sand, panting with open\r\nmouth._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Summoning his strength--sternly._] Put a clapper on that jaw\r\nof yours, Cates, or I’ll do it for ye!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Blubbering._] If we don’t find water--he’ll watch us die.\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Insinuatingly._] Better me knife cook fella--kill boy, too!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Will killin’ ’em give us drink, ye fools? [_After a pause, he\r\nshakes his head as if to drive off some thought, and mutters._] No more\r\no’ that! [_Suddenly, in a tone of sharp command._] No more o’ that, I\r\nsay! We’re keepin’ no right watch for ships. Go aloft on that tree,\r\nJimmy--and damn quick! Take a look and see if ye can sight a sail.\r\n[KANAKA _shins quickly up the bole of the coco palm to the top and looks\r\nout on all sides of him. The others rise painfully to their feet and\r\ngaze up at him with awakened hope._]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Suddenly, in a glad voice._] I see um--see sail, Captain.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Waving his arms frenziedly._] Sail--ho!\r\n\r\nJIMMY--Look plenty like trade schooner, Captain. She no change course\r\nshe fetch plenty close by here. She make full sail, she got plenty fella\r\nwind out there, she come quick.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Clapping_ CATES _on the back_.] Headin’ straight for us, Cates,\r\nd’you hear?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--How far d’ye reckon she be?\r\n\r\nJIMMY--She’s five, six fella mile, Captain.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Come down. [_The Islander slides down._ BARTLETT _exclaims\r\nexultantly_.] Didn’t I tell ye? In the nick o’ time. When she makes in\r\nclose we’ll go down to the reef and yell and wave at her. They’ll see!\r\nThe luck’s with us today! [_His eyes fall on the treasure and he\r\nstarts._] But now--what’s to do with this chest--the gold?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Quickly._] You ain’t going to tell them on the schooner about\r\nit?\r\n\r\nCATES--They’d claim to share with us.\r\n\r\nHORNE--More like they’d steal it and knife us in the bargain. I know the\r\nkind on them schooners.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Scornfully._] D’ye think I’m cracked? No, we’ll bury it\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Regretfully._] Leave it behind for anyone to find?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--We’ll bury it deep, where hell itself won’t find it--and we’ll\r\nmake a map o’ this island. [_He takes a sheet of paper and a stub of\r\npencil from his pocket--pointing to the foot of the tree._] Dig a hole\r\nhere--you, Horne and Jimmy--and dig it deep. [_The two head down and\r\ncommence to hollow out the sand with their hands._ BARTLETT _draws on\r\nthe paper_.] There’s the lagoon--and the reef--and here’s this tree--the\r\nonly one on the island--’twould be hard to miss. [_To_ CATES, _who is\r\npeering over his shoulder_.] And here where the tree is, d’ye see,\r\nCates, I’ll make a cross where the gold is hid.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Over his shoulder, without ceasing his work._] How d’ye know\r\nthe lay o’ this island--to find it again?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--By the last reckonin’ o’ the Triton’s. It’s writ on a page I\r\ntore from the log-book. And from there we headed due north in the boat,\r\nunless the compass lied--four days--a hundred and fifty miles, I reckon.\r\n[_Exultantly._] Oh, all hell’d not stop me from findin’ this place again\r\nwhen I know the gold’s here. Let us once get home and I’ll fit out a\r\nsmall schooner the four of us can sail, and we’ll come back here to dig\r\nit up. It won’t be long, I swear to ye!\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Straightening up._] This deep enough, sir?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--It looks to be.\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Who has straightened up and is looking off left--suddenly\r\npoints excitedly._] He look, Captain! Cook fella, he look here! Boy he\r\nlook, too! They look plenty too much, Captain! [_All four stand staring\r\noff at_ BUTLER _and the boy, whose presence on the island they have\r\nforgotten in their mad excitement_.]\r\n\r\nCATES--[_In stupid dismay._] They’ll know where it’s hid, sir!\r\n\r\nHORNE--They’ll tell ’em on the schooner!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Wildly._] We’ve got to do for ’em, Captain! Gimme your knife,\r\nJimmy--your knife---- [_He stumbles toward the Islander, who pushes him\r\naside brusquely, looking questioningly toward the Captain._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Who has been standing motionless, as if stunned by this\r\nforgotten complication--slowly._] There they be watchin’ us, the\r\nsneakin’ dogs! Sit down, an’ they won’t see. [_They all squat in the\r\nsand._] I was forgettin’ they was here. [_Striking his knee with\r\nclenched fist._] We’ve got to do somethin’ damn quick! That schooner’ll\r\nbe up soon where they kin sight her--and they’ll wave and yell then--and\r\nshe’ll see ’em!\r\n\r\nHORNE--And good-bye to the gold for us!\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Eagerly._] You say fella word, Captain, me kill um quick. They\r\nno make plenty cry for schooner! They keep damn still plenty too much!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Looking at the Islander with mad cunning but replying only\r\nto_ HORNE.] Aye, it’s good-bye to the gold, Horne. That scum of a\r\ncook--he’s made a mock o’ us--sayin’ it wasn’t gold when he knew it\r\nwas--he’ll tell ’em--he’ll get joy o’ tellin’ ’em!\r\n\r\nHORNE--And that scrub of a boy--he’s no better. He’ll be in with him\r\nneck and crop.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Hoarsely._] Knife ’em--and be done with it--I say!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Or, if they don’t tell the schooner’s skipper it’ll only be\r\nbecause they’re plannin’ to come back themselves--before we kin--and dig\r\nit up. That cook--there’s somethin’ queer in his mind--somethin’ he was\r\nhidin’--pretendin’ not to believe. What d’ye think, Horne?\r\n\r\nHORNE--I think--time’s gettin’ short--and talkin’ won’t do no good.\r\n[_Insinuatingly._] They’d do for us soon enough if _they_ was able.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye, murder was plain in his eyes when he looked at me.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Lowering his voice to a whisper._] Tell Jimmy--Captain\r\nBartlett--is what I say!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--It’s agin the law, Silas Horne!\r\n\r\nHORNE--The law don’t reach to this island.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Monotonously._] It’s against the law a captain’s sworn to\r\nkeep wherever he sails. They ain’t refused duty--nor mutinied.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Who’ll know they ain’t? They’re trying to steal what’s\r\nyours--that’s worse’n mutiny. [_As a final persuasion._] And Jimmy’s a\r\nnigger--and under no laws. And he’s stronger’n you are. You couldn’t\r\nstop ’im.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye--I couldn’t prevent----\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Eagerly._] I fix um, Captain, they no tell! [BARTLETT _doesn’t\r\nanswer, but stares at the treasure_. HORNE _makes violent motions to_\r\nJIMMY _to go. The Islander stares at his master’s face. Then, seeming to\r\nread the direct command there, he grunts with satisfaction, and pulling\r\nhis knife from it’s sheath, he goes stealthily off left._ CATES _raises\r\nhimself on his haunches to watch the Islander’s movements_. HORNE _and_\r\nBARTLETT _sit still in a strained immobility, their eyes on the chest_.]\r\n\r\nCATES--[_In an excited whisper._] I see ’em! They’re sittin’ with their\r\nbacks this way! [_A slight pause._] There’s Jimmy. He’s crawlin’ on his\r\nhands behind ’em. They don’t notice--he’s right behind--almost atop o’\r\nthem. [_A pause._ CATES _gives a fiendish grunt_.] Ugh! [BUTLER’S\r\n_muffled cry comes from the left_.] Right in the middle of the back! The\r\ncook’s done! The boy’s runnin’! [_There is a succession of quick screams\r\nfrom the boy, the padding of feet running toward them, the fall of a\r\nbody, and the boy’s dying groan._]\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_With satisfaction._] It’s done, sir!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Slowly._] I spoke no word, remember that, Silas Horne!\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Cunningly._] Nor me neither, sir. Jimmy took it on himself. If\r\nblame there is--and who’d blame him for it?--it’s on him.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Gloomily._] I spoke no word! [JIMMY _returns noiselessly\r\nfrom the left_.]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Grinning with savage pride._] I fix um fella plenty, Captain.\r\nThey no tell. They no open mouth plenty too much!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Maudlinly._] You’re a man, Jimmy--a man with guts to him--even\r\nif you’re a---- [_He babbles incoherently._]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_As the Captain does not look at him._] I go climb fella tree,\r\nCaptain? I make look for schooner?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Rousing himself with an effort._] Yes--go up. [_The Islander\r\nclimbs the tree._]\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Getting to his feet--eagerly._] Where away, Jimmy?\r\n\r\nJIMMY--She come, Captain, she come plenty quick.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Looking in the direction_ JIMMY _indicates_.] I kin see her\r\ntops’ls from here, sir. Look!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Getting to his feet--stares out to sea._] Aye! There she\r\nbe--and makin’ towards us fast. [_In a flash his sombre preoccupation is\r\ngone, and he is commander once more. He puts the anklet in his hand into\r\nhis coat pocket--harshly._] Come down out o’ that? They’s work to do.\r\n[JIMMY _clambers down_.] Did ye leave--them--lyin’ in plain sight on the\r\nopen sand?\r\n\r\nJIMMY--Yes. I no touch um, Captain.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Then ye’ll touch ’em now. Go, bury ’em, cover ’em up with\r\nsand. And mind ye make a good job o’ it that none’ll see. Jump now!\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Obediently._] I go, Captain. [_He hurries off left._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Down to the reef with ye, Horne! [_Giving the prostrate_ CATES\r\n_a kick_.] Up out o’ that, Cates! Go with Horne, and when ye see the\r\nschooner hull up, wave to ’em, and yell like mad, d’ye hear?\r\n\r\nHORNE--Aye, aye, sir!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I’ll stay here and bury the gold. It’s best to be quick about\r\nit! They may turn a spyglass on us when they raise the island from deck!\r\nOff with ye! [_He gives_ CATES _another kick_.]\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Groaning._] I’m sick! [_Incoherently._] Can’t--report for\r\nduty--this watch. [_With a shout._] Water!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Contemptuously._] Ye dog! Give him a hand, Horne.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Putting a hand under his shoulder._] Up, man! We’re to signal\r\nthe schooner. There’ll be water on board o’ her--barrels of it!\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Aroused, scrambles to his feet, violently shaking off Horne’s\r\nhand._] Water aboard o’ her! [_His staring eyes catch the schooner’s\r\nsails on the horizon. He breaks into a staggering run and disappears\r\ndown toward the beach, right rear, waving his arms wildly and\r\nshouting._] Ahoy! Ahoy! Water! [HORNE _walks out quickly after him_.]\r\n[_Left alone_, BARTLETT, _after a quick glance around, sinks on his\r\nknees beside the chest and shoves both hands into it. From the chest\r\ncomes a metallic clink as he fingers the pieces in his hands\r\ngloatingly._] Ye’re safe now! There’s none to tell left livin’! He’s\r\ndead--damn him!--that lied about ye. And ye’ll rest safe here till I\r\ncome back for ye! [_In a dreaming tone, his eyes fixed before him in an\r\necstatic vision._] No more whalin’ on the dirty seas! Rest to home!\r\nGold! I’ve been dreamin’ o’ it all my life! Aye--we’ll rest now, Sarah!\r\nYour father be a rich man, Nat and Sue! [_Shaking himself--savagely._]\r\nYe fool! What drivel be ye talkin’? Loosin’ your senses, be ye? Time ye\r\nwas picked up! Lucky! [_He shoves down the lid and places the chest in\r\nthe hole. He pushes the sand in on top of it, whispering hoarsely._] Lay\r\nsafe, d’ye hear. For I’ll be back for ye! Aye--in spite of hell I’ll dig\r\nye up again! [_The voices of_ HORNE _and_ JIMMY _can be heard from the\r\ndistance shouting as_\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Curtain Falls_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n     SCENE--_Interior of an old boat-shed on the wharf of the Bartlett\r\n     place on the California coast. In the rear, a double doorway\r\n     looking out over the end of the wharf to the bay with the open sea\r\n     beyond. On the left, two windows, and another door, opening on the\r\n     dock. Near this door, a cot with blankets and a pillow without a\r\n     slip. In the center, front, a table with a bottle and glasses on\r\n     it, and three cane-bottomed chairs. On the right, a fishing dory.\r\n     Here and there about the shed all sorts of odds and ends pertaining\r\n     to a ship--old anchors, ropes, tackle, paint-pots, old spars, etc._\r\n\r\n     _It is late afternoon of a day six months later. Sunlight filters\r\n     feebly through the stained, cobwebby window panes._\r\n\r\n     _As the curtain rises_, BARTLETT _and_ SILAS HORNE _are\r\n     discovered_. HORNE _is in working clothes of paint-stained\r\n     dungaree. If his sufferings on the island have left any marks on\r\n     his dry wizened face, they are undiscoverable. In_ BARTLETT,\r\n     _however, the evidence is marked. His hair has turned white. There\r\n     are deep hollows under his cheek-bones. His jaw and tight-lipped\r\n     mouth, express defiant determination, as if he were fighting back\r\n     some weakness inside himself, a weakness found in his eyes, which\r\n     have something in them of fear, of a wishing to avoid other eyes.\r\n     He is dressed much the same as when on the island. He sits by the\r\n     table, center, his abstracted gaze bent on the floor before him._\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Who is evidently waiting for the Captain to my something--after\r\na pause, glancing at him uneasily._] I’d best be gettin’ back aboard the\r\nschooner, sir. [_Receiving no answer he starts for the door on the\r\nleft._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Rousing himself with an effort._] Wait. [_After a pause._]\r\nThe full tide’s at dawn tomorrow, ye said?\r\n\r\nHORNE--Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--They know we’ll be sailin’ then, don’t they--Cates and Jimmy?\r\n\r\nHORNE--Yes, sir. They’re all ready. Oh, Cates and Jimmy’ll be glad o’\r\nthe word--and me, too, sir. [_With a greedy grin._] It’s all we’ve been\r\ntalkin’ of since ye brought us down here--diggin’ up the gold!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Passionately._] Aye, the gold! We’ll have it before long,\r\nnow, I reckon. That schooner--the way we’ve fitted her up--she’d take a\r\nman safe to the Pole and back! We’ll drop anchor here with the chest on\r\nboard in six months, unless---- [_Hesitates._]\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Uneasily._] What, sir?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Brusquely._] The weather, ye fool! Can ye take count before\r\no’ storms an’ calms?\r\n\r\nHORNE--We’ll trust to luck for that. [_Glancing at the Captain\r\ncuriously._] And speakin’ o’ luck, sir--the schooner ain’t been\r\nchristened yet.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Betraying a sudden, fierce determination._] She will be!\r\n\r\nHORNE--There’d be no luck for a ship sailin’ out without a name.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--She’ll have a name, I tell ye! A name that’ll take all curse\r\naway and leave her clean. She’ll be named the Sarah Allen, and Sarah’ll\r\nchristen her herself.\r\n\r\nHORNE--It oughter been done, by rights, when we launched her a month\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Sternly._] I know that as well as ye. [_After a pause._] She\r\nwasn’t willin’ to do it then. Women has queer notions--when they’re\r\nsick, like. [_Defiantly--as if he were addressing someone outside of the\r\nroom._] But Sarah’ll be willin’ now! She’ll be willin’ in spite o’----\r\n[_Catching himself and abruptly lowering his voice._] The schooner’ll be\r\nchristened tomorrow at dawn afore she sails.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Yes, sir. [_He again turns to go, as if he were anxious to get\r\naway._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Wait! There’s somethin’ else I want to ask ye. Nat, he’s been\r\nhangin’ round the schooner all his spare time o’ late. I seen him\r\ntalkin’ to you and Cates and Jimmy. [_With rising anger._] I hope ye’ve\r\nremembered what I ordered ye, all three. Not a word o’ it to him! I said\r\nI’d keep him out o’ this, for his own good, mind! And if I thought any\r\nof ye---- [_His fist is raised threateningly, and he glares savagely at\r\nHorne._]\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Retreating a step--hastily._] No fear o’ that, sir! We’ve been\r\nkeerful. But it’s hard. He’s a sharp one, Nat is. And when we tells him\r\nthe schooner’s fitted out for tradin’ in the islands, he just laughs.\r\nHe’s gettin’ the wind on somethin’--without any o’ us sayin’ a word.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In relieved tones._] Let him s’spect all he’s a mind to--as\r\nlong as he don’t know. It ain’t that I’m afeerd to tell him o’ the gold,\r\nSilas Horne. He’ll share that, anyway. [_Slowly._] It’s them--other\r\nthings--I’d keep him clear of.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Immediately guessing what he means--reassuringly._] We was all\r\nout o’ our heads with thirst and sun when them things happened, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Mad? Aye! But I ain’t forgot--them two. [_Harshly._] I’d\r\nrather be you nor me, Silas Horne. You be too rotten bad to care. And\r\nI’d rather be Cates or Jimmy. Cates be too dull to remember, and Jimmy\r\nbe proud as a boy o’ what he done. [_He represses a shudder--then goes\r\non slowly._] Do they ever come back to you--when you’re asleep, I mean?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Pretending mystification._] Who’s that, sir?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With sombre emphasis._] That cook and that boy. They come to\r\nme. I’m gettin’ to be afeered o’ goin’ to sleep--not ’feered o’ them, I\r\ndon’t mean. [_With sudden defiant bravado._] Not all the ghosts out o’\r\nhell kin keep me from a thing I’ve set my mind on. [_Collecting\r\nhimself._] But I’ve waked up talkin’ out loud--to them--and I’m afeerd\r\nthere might be someone hear me. That’s why I’ve been sleepin’ down here\r\nto the boat-house all alone.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Uneasily--with an attempt to be reassuring._] You ain’t all\r\ncured o’ that sun and thirst on the island yet, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Evidently reassured--roughly._] O’ course! D’ye think I’d\r\nreally believe in things in nightmares? [_With an attempt at\r\nconviviality._] Sit down a bit, Horne, and take a grog. [HORNE _does\r\nso_. BARTLETT _pours out a half-tumbler full of rum for himself and\r\nshoves the bottle over to_ HORNE.]\r\n\r\nHORNE--Luck to our vige, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye, luck! [_They drink._ BARTLETT _leans over and taps_ HORNE\r\n_on the arm_.] Aye, it takes time to get cured o’ thirst and sun! Lucky\r\nthat tradin’ schooner picked us up the time she did.\r\n\r\nHORNE--If she hadn’t--we’d been as dead men--as them two.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Somberly--after a pause._] I spoke no word, Silas Horne,\r\nd’ye remember?\r\n\r\nHORNE--Nor me. Jimmy did it alone. [_Craftily._] We’d all three swear\r\nBible oaths to that in any court. And even if ye’d given the word, there\r\nain’t no good thinkin’ more o’ it, sir. Didn’t they deserve all they\r\ngot--that thief o’ a cook and that boy? Wasn’t they plottin’ on the sly\r\nto steal the gold?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His eyes gleaming._] Aye!\r\n\r\nHORNE--And when you said he’d get no share of it, didn’t he lie to your\r\nface that it wasn’t gold--thinkin’ we’d leave it be and he’d git it all\r\nfor himself?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With sudden rage._] Aye, brass and junk, he said, the lyin’\r\nscum! That’s what he keeps sayin’ when I see him in sleep! He didn’t\r\nbelieve--makin’ a mock o’ me--an’ then he owned up himself ’twas gold!\r\nHe knew! He lied a-purpose! He was a cunnin’ rat--a thief ashore afore\r\nthey shipped him with us, I reckon.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Eagerly._] Most like, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Rising to his feet--with confident defiance._] They deserved\r\nno better nor they got. Let ’em rot! [_Pouring out another drink for\r\nhimself and_ HORNE.] We’ll drink, an’ then ye get back to the ship. Tell\r\nCates and Jimmy we sail at dawn--sure! [_He drinks._]\r\n\r\nHORNE--Luck, sir! [_He drinks. There is a knock at the door on the left\r\nfollowed by_ MRS. BARTLETT’S _voice calling feebly_, “ISAIAH! ISAIAH!”\r\nBARTLETT _starts but makes no answer. He seems suddenly sunk in gloom\r\nagain._ HORNE _turns to him questioningly._] It’s Mrs. Bartlett, sir.\r\nShall I open the door?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--No. I ain’t aimin’ to see her--yet awhile. [_Then with sudden\r\nreasonless rage._] Let her in, damn ye! [HORNE _goes and unhooks the\r\ndoor_. MRS. BARTLETT _enters. She is a slight, slender little woman of\r\nfifty. Sickness, or the inroads of a premature old age, have bowed her\r\nshoulders, whitened her hair, and forced her to walk feebly with the aid\r\nof a cane. A resolute spirit still flashes from her eyes, however, and\r\nthere is a look of fixed determination on her face. She stands gazing at\r\nher husband. There is something accusing in her stare._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Avoiding her eyes--brusquely._] Well? What is it ye want o’\r\nme, Sarah?\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--I want to speak with you alone, Isaiah.\r\n\r\nHORNE--I’ll be gettin’ back aboard, sir. [_Starts to go._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In a tone almost of fear._] Wait. I’m goin’ with ye.\r\n[_Turning to his wife--with a certain rough tenderness._] Ye oughtn’t to\r\nwalk down the hill here, Sarah. The doctor told ye to rest in the house\r\nand save your strength.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--I want to speak to you alone, Isaiah. You never come to home no\r\nmore, hardly, so I had to come to ye. [_Accusingly._] You know it ain’t\r\nwalkin’ is sappin’ my strength, Isaiah.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Very uneasily._] I’ve got to work on the schooner, Sarah.\r\nThat’s why I’ve no time to home.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--She’ll be sailin’ soon?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Suddenly turning on her defiantly._] Tomorrow at dawn!\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--[_With her eyes fired accusingly on his._] And you be goin’\r\nwith her?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In the same defiant tone._] Yes, I be! Who else’d captain\r\nher?\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--On a craft without a name.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--She’ll have that name.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--No.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--She’ll have that name, I tell ye.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--No.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Thoroughly aroused, his will tries to break hers, but finds\r\nher unbending. He mutters menacingly._] Ye’ll see! We’ll talk o’ that\r\nlater, you and me. [_With sudden apprehension._] But not now. They’s\r\nplenty o’ time yet for that. Come on, Horne, we’ll get aboard. [_Without\r\na further glance at his wife he strides past her and disappears through\r\nthe doorway, followed by_ HORNE. MRS. BARTLETT _sinks down in the chair\r\nby the table. She appears suddenly weak and crushed. Then from outside\r\ncomes a girl’s laughing voice._ MRS. BARTLETT _does not seem to hear,\r\nnor to notice_ SUE _and_ DREW _when they enter_. SUE _is a slender,\r\npretty girl of about twenty, with large blue eyes, reddish-brown hair,\r\nand a healthy, sun-tanned, out-of-door complexion. In spite of the\r\nslightness of her figure there is a suggestion of great vitality and\r\nnervous strength about her._ DREW _is a well-set-up, tall young fellow\r\nof thirty. Not in any way handsome, his boyish face, tanned to a deep\r\nbrown, possesses an engaging character of healthy, cheerful\r\nforcefullness that has its compelling charm. There would be no chance of\r\nmistaking him for anything but the ship’s officer he is. It is written\r\non his face, his walk, his voice, his whole bearing._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_As they enter._] He’ll either be here or on the schooner, Danny.\r\n[_Then she sees her mother, with startled amazement._] Ma! Good heavens,\r\nwhat are you doing here? [_Throwing her arms around her neck and kissing\r\nher._] Don’t you know you shouldn’t----\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--[_With a start--turning to her daughter with a forced smile._]\r\nThere, Sue, now! Don’t go scoldin’ me. [_Then seeing_ DREW--_in a tone\r\nof forced gaiety_.] And if there ain’t Danny Drew--back home to port at\r\nlast! You can kiss an old woman, Danny--without makin’ her jealous, I\r\nreckon.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Kissing her--with a smile._] I don’t know about that, Ma\r\nBartlett. [_Heartily._] It certainly seems good to see you again--and be\r\nback again myself.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--We’ve been expectin’ you right along this past month. Then we\r\nread in the paper t’other day where your ship’d reached San Francisco,\r\nand we knew you’d be down any day. Sue’s been on pins and needles ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Protestingly._] Ma!\r\n\r\nDREW--We were delayed in Valparaiso, waiting for cargo. [_With a grin._]\r\nIt’s a long time to be away from Sue--four months.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Laughing._] It seems more like four years!\r\n\r\nDREW--You remember, Ma, I left just after the big excitement here--when\r\nCaptain Bartlett turned up after we’d all heard the Triton was wrecked\r\nand given him up for lost. That was sure a wonderful surprise when he\r\nwalked into the house that day.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--[_Her face clouding--in a tone of deep sorrow._] Yes. [DREW _is\r\nsurprised and glances at_ SUE _questioningly_. She sighs. MRS. BARTLETT\r\n_gets to her feet with difficulty, assisted by_ DREW. _She forces a\r\nsmile._] I’ve taken on a third leg since you was here, Danny!\r\n\r\nSUE--We’ll help you back to the house. You can’t climb that steep hill\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--Shucks! I’m sick o’ the house. I need sun and fresh air, and\r\ntoday’s so nice I couldn’t stay indoors. I’ll take your arm to hold on\r\nto, Danny. No, I ain’t goin’ up to the house yet awhile, so don’t you\r\ntry to bully me into it, Sue. I’m goin’ to set in the shade o’ this shed\r\nout on the wharf and watch your Pa workin’ on the schooner. Ain’t much\r\ntime left to see her, Sue. They’re sailin’ tomorrow at dawn, your Pa\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nSUE--Tomorrow? Then--you’re going to christen her?\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--[_With grim determination._] No, I ain’t, Sue! [_Catching_\r\nDREW’S _glance fixed on her with puzzled curiosity, she immediately\r\nattempts to resume her joking tone_.] Shucks! Here’s Danny wonderin’\r\nwhat silliness we’re talkin’ of. It’s just this, Danny. Captain\r\nBartlett, he’s got a crazy notion in his head that just because his ship\r\nwas wrecked last vige he’ll give up whalin’ for life. He’s fitted out\r\nthis little schooner for tradin’ in the Islands. More money in that, he\r\nsays. But I don’t agree with no such lunatic notions, and I’m just that\r\nstubborn I’m not goin’ to set my approval on his craziness by\r\nchristenin’ his ship with my name, like he wants me to. He’d ought to\r\nstick to whalin,’ like he’s done all his life. Don’t you think so,\r\nDanny?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Embarrassed._] Why, sure--he’s rated one of the smartest whaling\r\nskippers here on the coast--and I should think----\r\n\r\nMRS. B.--Just what I tell him--only he’s that stubborn. I’d best get out\r\nquick while it’s still sunny and warm. It’s damp in here for an old\r\nbody. [DREW _helps her to the door on the left, opens it, and the two go\r\nout, followed by_ SUE, _who carries a chair. After a pause_, SUE _and_\r\nDREW _return_. SUE _carefully shuts the door after them. Her face is\r\ntroubled._]\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Looks at her for a minute, then comes and puts his arm around\r\nher and kisses her._] What’s the trouble, Sue?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Trying to force a smile._] Nothing, Danny.\r\n\r\nDREW--Oh, yes there is! No use putting me off that way. Why, I’ve felt\r\nit hanging about in the air ever since I first looked at your mother.\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes, she’s failed terribly since you saw her last.\r\n\r\nDREW--Oh, I don’t mean just sickness--only--did you notice how she had\r\nto--force herself--to joke about things? She used to be so cheerful\r\nnatural. [_Scratching his head in honest puzzlement._] But--that ain’t\r\nwhat I mean, either. What is it, Sue? Maybe I can help somehow. You look\r\nworried, too. Pshaw! You can tell me, can’t you?\r\n\r\nSUE--Why, yes, Danny--of course--if I could tell--only I’m just as\r\npuzzled as you over what it comes from.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Persuasively._] Well, you sit down and tell me what’s happened\r\nsince I’ve been away. Then maybe we can put our heads together and\r\nfigure out what’s wrong, and turn to get things ship-shape again. [SUE\r\n_sits down but does not speak_. DREW _remarks as if to get her\r\nstarted_.] That schooner’s a smart little craft for sailing, I should\r\nsay. I didn’t notice no one about working, though.\r\n\r\nSUE--No. They’re probably below in the cabin, drinking. That’s all\r\nthey’ve been doing lately. The schooner’s been ready to sail for two\r\nweeks--but Pa has kept waiting--I don’t know what for. Yes, I do know,\r\ntoo--I think I guess. He’s been waiting for Ma to give in and christen\r\nthe ship with her name. But she won’t give in. You heard her.\r\n\r\nDREW--Well, I suppose she does take it to heart that he’d give up the\r\nbusiness he’s been in all his life to go in for something new--at his\r\nage.\r\n\r\nSUE--He mortgaged the house to get money to buy and fit out this\r\nschooner. You know he lost most everything when the Triton was wrecked.\r\nHe’d only had her two years, and she cost him a pile of money. Then,\r\ntoo, he’s lost a lot all his life--since he and Ma moved out here from\r\nthe East--investing in all sorts of silly mining ventures--gold mines\r\nthat always turned out to be only holes in the ground. As far back as I\r\ncan remember he’s never seemed to care about the whaling business--the\r\noil. Ambergris was what he was after. Finding one chunk of that meant\r\nmore to him than a full cargo of oil.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_With a grin._] “Old Ambergris.” That’s what they call him along\r\nthe coast--behind his back, of course. I reckon he was sort of\r\nprospecting the Pacific Ocean looking for an ambergris mine.\r\n[_Apologetically._] Sounds as if I was making fun of him, but you\r\nremember how you’n’ me ’n’ Nat used to laugh about it together.\r\n\r\nSUE--It’s past a laughing matter now, Danny.\r\n\r\nDREW--And what do you reckon the real trouble is?\r\n\r\nSUE--Something between him and Ma--something that only the two of them\r\nknow. It all seemed to start one morning after you’d left--about a week\r\nafter he’d come home with those three awful men. During that first week\r\nhe acted all right--just like he used to--only he’d get talking kind of\r\nwild now and then about being glad the Triton was lost, and promising\r\nwe’d all be millionaires once he started making trips on the schooner.\r\nMa didn’t seem to mind his going in for trading then. Then, the night of\r\nthe day he bought the schooner, something must have happened between\r\nthem. Neither of them came down to breakfast. I went up to Ma, and found\r\nher so sick we sent for the doctor. He said she’d suffered a great shock\r\nof some kind, although she wouldn’t tell him a word. I found Pa down in\r\nthis shed. He’d moved that cot down here, and said he’d have to sleep\r\nhere after that because he wanted to be near the schooner. It’s been\r\nthat way ever since. He’s slept down here and never come up to the house\r\nexcept at mealtimes. He’s never been alone with Ma one second since\r\nthen, I don’t believe. And she--she’s been trying to corner him, to get\r\nhim alone. I’ve noticed it, although she does her best to hide it from\r\nNat and me. And she’s been failing, growing weaker and sicker looking\r\nevery day. [_Breaking down._] Oh, Danny, these last months have been\r\nterrible! I’m so glad you’re back again.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Soothing her._] There! It’ll all come out right.\r\n\r\nSUE--I’m sure that’s why she’s crept down here today. She’s bound she’ll\r\nsee him alone before he sails.\r\n\r\nDREW--Well, maybe it’s for the best. Maybe when they’ve had it out,\r\nthings’ll clear up.\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes, perhaps. But I can’t help feeling--it’ll only make it worse.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Frowning._] Seems to me it must be all your Pa’s fault,\r\nSue--whatever it is. Have you tried to talk to him?\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes--a good many times; but all he’s ever said was: “There’s things\r\nyou wouldn’t take interest in, Sue. You’ll know when it’s time to\r\nknow.”--and then he’d break off by asking me what I’d like most to have\r\nin the world if he had piles of money. And then, one time, he seemed to\r\nbe terribly afraid of something, and he said to me: “You hustle up and\r\nmarry Danny, Sue. You marry him and get out of this.”\r\n\r\nDREW--[_With an affectionate grin._] That does sound crazy--any man\r\nwanting to get rid of you that way. [_A note of entreaty in his voice._]\r\nBut I surely wish you’d take his advice, Sue! [_He kisses her._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With intense longing._] Oh, I wish I could, Danny.\r\n\r\nDREW--I’ve quite considerable saved now, Sue, and it won’t be so long\r\nbefore I get my own ship, I’m hoping, now that I’ve got my master’s\r\ncertificate. I was hoping at the end of this voyage----\r\n\r\nSUE--So was I, Danny--but it can’t be this time. With Ma so weak, and no\r\none to take care of her but me---- [_Shaking her head--in a tone of\r\ndecision._] I couldn’t leave home now, Danny. It wouldn’t be right. I\r\ncouldn’t feel really happy--until this thing--whatever it is--is settled\r\nbetween Pa and Ma and they’re just as they used to be again.\r\n[_Pleadingly._] You understand, don’t you, Danny?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Soberly._] Why--surely I do, Sue. [_He pats her hand._] Only,\r\nit’s hard waiting. [_He sighs._]\r\n\r\nSUE--I know. It’s just as hard for me.\r\n\r\nDREW--I thought maybe I could help; but this isn’t anything anyone\r\noutside your family could mix in. [SUE _shakes her head. He goes on\r\ngloomily after a pause._] What’s the matter with Nat? Seems as if he\r\nought to be able to step in and talk turkey to your Pa.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Slowly._] You’ll find Nat changed, too, Danny--changed terribly.\r\nHe’s caught the disease--whatever it is. You know how interested in his\r\nwork he’s been ever since they put him in the designing department down\r\nin the shipyard?\r\n\r\nDREW--Yes.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With emphasis._] Well, all that’s changed. He hates it now, or at\r\nleast he says he does. And when he comes home, he spends all his time\r\nprowling around the dock here, talking with those three awful men. And\r\nwhat do you think he told me only the other day? That he was bound he’d\r\nthrow up his job and make this voyage on the schooner. He even asked me\r\nto ask Pa to let him go.\r\n\r\nDREW--Your Pa doesn’t want him to, eh?\r\n\r\nSUE--Why, of course not! Leave a fine position he worked so hard to get\r\njust for this crazy notion! Pa’d never let him. He’s even ordered him to\r\nkeep off the schooner and not to talk to those men.\r\n\r\nDREW--Funny Nat’d like to go to sea. He’s always seemed to want to fight\r\nshy of it.\r\n\r\nSUE--The terrible part is, he’s got Ma worried to death--as if she\r\nwasn’t upset enough already. She’s so afraid he’ll go--that Pa’ll let\r\nhim at the last moment. She’s always pleading with Nat not to think of\r\nit--so that he keeps out of her way, too. Poor Ma! She’s only got me to\r\ntalk to.\r\n\r\nDREW--Maybe I can help after all. I can talk to Nat.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Shaking her head._] He’s not the same Nat, Danny.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Trying to be consoling._] Pshaw, Sue! I think you just get to\r\nimagining things. [_As he finishes speaking, the door in the rear opens\r\nand_ NAT _appears. He is a tall, loose-framed boy of eighteen, who bears\r\na striking resemblance to his father. His face, like his father’s, is\r\nlarge and bony, with deep-set black eyes, an aquiline nose, and a wide,\r\nthin-lipped mouth. There is no suggestion in_ NAT, _however, of the\r\nolder man’s physical health and great strength. He appears an indoor\r\nproduct, undeveloped in muscle, with a sallow complexion and stooped\r\nshoulders. His thick hair is a deep black. His voice recalls his\r\nfather’s, hollow and penetrating. He is dressed in a grey flannel shirt\r\nand corduroy trousers._ DREW _calls out to him, heartly_.] Hello, Nat!\r\nSpeak of the Devil! Sue and I were just talking about you. [_He goes\r\ntoward_ NAT, _his hand outstretched_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Comes toward them, meets_ DREW, _and shakes his hand with evident\r\npleasure_.] Hello, Danny! You’re a sight for sore eyes! [_His manner\r\nundergoes a sudden change. He casts a quick, suspicious glance from_\r\nDREW _to his sister_.] You were talking about me? What about?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Quickly--with a warning glance at_ DREW.] About your work down at\r\nthe shipyard.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Disgustedly._] Oh, that. [_In a tone of reasonless irritation._]\r\nFor God’s sake, Sue, let me alone about my work. Don’t I have to live\r\nwith the damn thing all day, without your shoving it in my face the\r\nminute I get home? I want to forget it--get away!\r\n\r\nDREW--Go to sea, eh?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Suspiciously._] Maybe. Why? What do you mean?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Warned by a glance from Sue, says carelessly._] Well, that’s\r\nwhere you’d be apt to go, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Suspiciously._] That isn’t what you were thinking, Danny.\r\n[_Turning to his sister--angrily._] What have you been telling Danny?\r\n\r\nSUE--I was talking about the schooner--telling him that she sails\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Dumfounded._] Tomorrow? [_Overcome by sudden, nervous\r\nexcitement._] It can’t be. How do you know? Who told you?\r\n\r\nSUE--Ma. Pa told her.\r\n\r\nNAT--Then she’s been talking to him--telling him not to take me, I’ll\r\nbet. [_Angrily._] Oh, I wish Ma’d mind her own business!\r\n\r\nSUE--Nat!\r\n\r\nNAT--Well, Sue, how would you like it? I’m not a little boy any more. I\r\nknow what I want to do. I want to go with them. I want to go more than\r\nI’ve ever wanted anything else in my life before. He--he doesn’t want\r\nme. He’s afraid I--But I think I can force him to---- [_He glances at_\r\nDREW’S _amazed face and stops abruptly--sullenly_.] Where is Pa?\r\n\r\nSUE--He’s aboard the schooner.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Disappointedly._] Then it’s no good trying to see him now. I’ll\r\nhave to wait.\r\n\r\nDREW--Sound’s funny to hear you talking about going to sea. Why, you\r\nalways used----\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Wearily._] I know. This is different.\r\n\r\nDREW--You want to see the Islands, I suppose?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Suspiciously._] Maybe. Why not?\r\n\r\nDREW--What group is your Pa heading for first?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_More suspiciously._] You’ll have to ask him. Why do you want to\r\nknow? [_Abruptly._] You better be getting up to the house, Sue--if we’re\r\nto have any supper. Danny must be hungry. [_He turns his back on them.\r\nThey exchange meaning glances._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With a sigh._] It must be getting late. Come on, Danny. You can\r\nsee Pa later on. [_They go toward the door in the rear._] Aren’t you\r\ncoming, Nat?\r\n\r\nNAT--No. I’ll wait. [_Impatiently._] Go ahead. I’ll be up before long.\r\n\r\nDREW--See you later, then, Nat.\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes. [_They go out, rear._ NAT _paces up and down in a great state\r\nof excitement. The door on the left is opened and_ BARTLETT _enters. His\r\neyes are wild, as if he had been drinking heavily, but he shows no\r\nother effects. Father and son stand looking at one another for a\r\nsecond._ NAT _takes a step backward as if in fear, then straightens up\r\ndefiantly_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Slowly._] Is this the way ye mind my orders, boy? I’ve told\r\nye time an’ again not to be sneakin’ and spyin’ around this wharf.\r\n\r\nNAT--I’m not sneaking and spying. I wanted to talk to you, Pa.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Sits down by the table._] Well, here I be.\r\n\r\nNAT--Sue said the schooner sails tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Resolutely._] I want to go with you, Pa.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Briefly--as if dismissing the matter._] Ye can’t. I’ve told\r\nye that before. Let this be the last time ye ask it.\r\n\r\nNAT--But why? Why can’t I go?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye’ve your own work to do--good work. Attend to that and leave\r\nme to mine.\r\n\r\nNAT--But you always wanted me to go on voyages to learn whaling with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--This be different.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_With excited indignation._] Yes, this is different! Don’t I know\r\nit? Do you think you can hide that from me? It is different, and that’s\r\nwhy I want to go.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye can’t, I say.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Pleadingly._] But why not, Pa? I’m not a boy. I can do a man’s\r\nwork on a ship, or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Roughly._] Let’s have done with talk! Your place is here,\r\nwith Sue and your Ma, and here you’ll stay.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Angrily._] That isn’t any reason. But I know your real one.\r\nYou’re afraid----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Half rising to his feet._] Ye say that to me? [_Recovering\r\nhimself with an effort and settling down again._] Keep a clapper on your\r\njaw, boy. That’s talk I’ll not put up with. [_With a touch of\r\nuneasiness--forcing a scornful laugh._] Afeerd! Afeerd o’ what? Did ye\r\never know me to be afeerd?\r\n\r\nNAT--Afraid of what I know, of what I might find out if I went with you.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With the same forced, uneasy scorn._] And what d’ye think\r\nye’d find out, Nat?\r\n\r\nNAT--First of all that it’s not a trading venture you’re going on. Oh,\r\nI’m not a fool! That story is all right to fool the neighbors and girls\r\nlike Sue. But I know better.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--What d’ye know?\r\n\r\nNAT--You’re going for something else.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--What would that be?\r\n\r\nNAT--I don’t know--exactly. Something--on that island.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--What?\r\n\r\nNAT--I don’t know. But I could guess a lot of things. [_With sudden\r\nexcitement._] Ambergris! That’s it! Is that it? It must be. That’s what\r\nyou’ve been hunting for years.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye--and never found! [_He gets to his feet with a forced\r\nburst of laughter._] Ambergris! Ye fool of a boy! Ye got that notion out\r\no’ some fool book ye’ve been reading, didn’t ye? And I thought ye’d\r\ngrowed to be a man! [_More and more wild in his forced scorn._] Ye’ll be\r\ntellin’ me next it’s buried treasure I be sailin’ after--pirates’ gold\r\nburied on that island--all in a chest--and a map to guide me with a\r\ncross marked on it where the gold is hid! And then they be ghosts\r\nguardin’ it, ben’t they--spirits o’ murdered men? They always be, in the\r\nbooks. [_He laughs scornfully._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Gazing at him with fascinated eyes._] No, not that last. That’s\r\nsilly--but I did think you might have found--\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Laughing again._] Treasure? Gold? [_With forced sternness._]\r\nNat, I be ashamed of ye. Ye’ve had schoolin’, and ye’ve been doin’ a\r\nman’s work in the world, and doin’ it well, and I’d hoped ye’d take my\r\nplace here to home when I be away, and look after your Ma and Sue. But\r\nye’ve owned up to bein’ little better nor a boy in short britches,\r\ndreamin’ o’ pirates’ gold that never was ’cept in books.\r\n\r\nNAT--But you--you’re to blame. When you first came home you did nothing\r\nbut talk mysteriously of how rich we’d all be when the schooner got\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Roughly._] But what’s that to do with silly dreams? It’s in\r\nthe line o’ trade I meant.\r\n\r\nNAT--But why be so mysterious about trade? There’s something you’re\r\nhiding. You can’t say no because I feel it.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Insinuatingly--with a crafty glance at his son._] Supposin’\r\nin one of them Eastern trading ports I’d run across a bit o’ business\r\nwith a chance for a fortune in it for a man that wasn’t afeerd of the\r\nlaw, and could keep his mouth shut?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Disappointed._] You mean illegal trading?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I mean what I mean, Nat--and I’d be a fool to tell an\r\novergrown boy, or two women--or any man in the world, for the matter o’\r\nthat--what I do mean.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Turning toward the door in the rear--disgustedly._] If it’s only\r\nthat, I don’t want to hear it. [_He walks toward the door--stops and\r\nturns again to his father._] No, I don’t believe it. That’s not like\r\nyou. You’re not telling the truth, Pa.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Rising to his feet--with a savage sternness in which there\r\nis a wild note of entreaty._] I’ve listened to your fool’s talk enough.\r\nGet up to the house where ye belong! I’ll stand no more o’ your meddling\r\nin business o’ mine. I’ve been patient with ye, but there’s an end to\r\nthat! Take heed o’ what I’m sayin’, if ye know what’s good for ye! I’d\r\nrather see ye dead tonight than sail on that schooner at dawn. I’d kill\r\nye with my own hands first! [_With a sort of sombre pride._] I’ll stand\r\nalone in this business and finish it out alone if I go to hell for it.\r\nYe hear me?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Alarmed by this outburst--submissively._] Yes, Pa.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Then see that ye heed. [_After a pause--as_ NAT _lingers_.]\r\nThey’ll be waitin’ for ye at the house.\r\n\r\nNAT--All right. I’ll go. [_He turns to the doorway on the left, but\r\nbefore he gets to it, the door is pushed open and_ MRS. BARTLETT\r\n_enters_. NAT _stops, startled_.] Ma!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_With a forced smile._] Run along, Nat. It’s all right.\r\nI want to speak with your Pa.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Uneasily._] Ye’d best go up with Nat, Sarah. I’ve work to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Fixing her eyes on her husband._] I want to talk with\r\nyou alone, Isaiah.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Grimly--as if he were accepting a challenge._] As ye like,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Dismissing_ NAT _with a feeble attempt at a smile_.]\r\nTell Sue I’ll be comin’ up directly, Nat.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Hesitates for a moment, looking from one to the other\r\nuneasily._] All right, Ma. [_He goes out._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Waits for_ NAT _to get out of hearing_.] Won’t ye set,\r\nSarah? [_She comes forward and sits by the table. He sits by the other\r\nside._]\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Shuddering as she sees the bottle on the table._] Will\r\ndrinkin’ this poison make you forget, Isaiah?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Gruffly._] I’ve naught to forget--leastways naught that’s in\r\nyour mind. But they’s things about the stubborn will o’ woman I’d like\r\nto forget. [_They look at each other across the table. There is a pause.\r\nFinally he cannot stand her accusing glance. He looks away, gets to his\r\nfeet, walks about, then sits down again, his face set determinedly--with\r\na grim smile._] Well, here we be, Sarah--alone together for the first\r\ntime since--\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Quickly._] Since that night, Isaiah.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As if he hadn’t heard._] Since I come back to you, almost.\r\nDid ye ever stop to think o’ how strange it be we’d ever come to this? I\r\nnever dreamed a day’d come when ye’d force me to sleep away from ye,\r\nalone in a shed like a mangy dog!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Gently._] I didn’t drive you away, Isaiah. You came o’\r\nyour own will.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Because o’ your naggin’ tongue, woman--and the wrong ye\r\nthought o’ me.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Shaking her head, slowly._] It wasn’t me you ran from,\r\nIsaiah. You ran away from your own self--the conscience God put in you\r\nthat you think you can fool with lies.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Starting to his feet--angrily._] Lies?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--It’s the truth, Isaiah, only you be too weak to face it.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With defiant bravado._] Ye’ll find I be strong enough to\r\nface anything, true or lie! [_Then protestingly._] What call have ye to\r\nthink evil o’ me, Sarah? It’s mad o’ ye to hold me to account for things\r\nI said in my sleep--for the damned nightmares that set me talkin’ wild\r\nwhen I’d just come home and my head was still cracked with the thirst\r\nand the sun I’d borne on that island. Is that right, woman, to be\r\nblamin’ me for mad dreams?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--You confessed the rest of what you said was true--of the\r\ngold you’d found and buried there.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With a sudden fierce exultation._] Aye--that be true as\r\nBible, Sarah. When I’ve sailed back in the schooner, ye’ll see for\r\nyourself. There be a big chest o’ it, yellow and heavy, and fixed up\r\nwith diamonds, emeralds and sech, that be worth more, even, nor the\r\ngold. We’ll be rich, Sarah--rich like I’ve always dreamed we’d be!\r\nThere’ll be silks and carriages for ye--all the woman’s truck in the\r\nworld ye’ve a mind to want--and all that Nat and Sue’ll want, too.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_With a shudder._] Are you tryin’ to bribe me,\r\nIsaiah--with a treasure that’s been cursed by God?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As if he hadn’t heard._] D’ye remember long ago, back East,\r\njust after we was married, and I was skipper o’ my first whalin’ ship,\r\nhow that foreigner come to me with the map o’ the pirates’ gold and\r\nasked me to charter the ship? D’ye remember o’ how I’d talk to ye o’\r\nfindin’ ambergris, a pile o’ it on one vige that’d make us rich? Ye used\r\nto take interest then, and all th’ voyage with me ye’d be hopin’ I’d\r\nfind it, too.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--That was my sin o’ greed that I’m bein’ punished for now.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Again as if he hadn’t heard._] And now when it’s come to us\r\nat last--bigger nor I ever dreamed on--ye drive me away from ye and say\r\nit’s cursed.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Inexorably._] Cursed with the blood o’ the man and boy\r\nye murdered!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In a mad rage._] Ye lie, woman! I spoke no word!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--That’s what you kept repeatin’ in your sleep, night after\r\nnight that first week you was home, till I knew the truth, and could\r\nbear no more. “I spoke no word!” you kept sayin’, as if ’twas your own\r\nsoul had you at the bar of judgment. And “That cook, he didn’t believe\r\n’twas gold,” you’d say, and curse him.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Wildly._] He was lyin’, the thief! Lyin’ so’s he and the boy\r\ncould steal th’ gold. I made him own up he was lyin’. What if it’s all\r\ntrue, what ye heard? Hadn’t we the right to do away with two thieves?\r\nAnd we was all mad with thirst and sun. Can ye hold madmen to account\r\nfor the things they do?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--You wasn’t so crazed but you remember.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I remember I spoke no word, Sarah--as God’s my judge!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--But you could have prevented it with a word, couldn’t\r\nyou, Isaiah? That heathen savage lives in the fear of you. He’d not have\r\ndone it if----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Gloomily._] That’s woman’s talk. There be three o’ us can\r\nswear in any court I spoke no word.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--What are courts? Can you swear it to yourself? You can’t,\r\nand it’s that’s drivin’ you mad, Isaiah. Oh, I’d never have believed it\r\nof you for all you said in sleep, if it wasn’t for the way you looked\r\nand acted out of sleep. I watched you that first week, Isaiah, till the\r\nfear of it had me down sick. I had to watch you, you was so strange and\r\nfearful to me. At first I kept sayin’, ’twas only you wasn’t rid o’ the\r\nthirst and the sun yet. But then, all to once, God gave me sight, and I\r\nsaw ’twas guilt written on your face, on the queer stricken way you\r\nacted, and guilt in your eyes. [_She stares into them._] I see it now,\r\nas I always see it when you look at me. [_She covers her face with her\r\nhands with a sob._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His face haggard and drawn--hopelessly, as if he were too\r\nbeaten to oppose her further--in a hoarse whisper._] What would ye have\r\nme do, Sarah?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Taking her hands from her face--her eyes lighting up\r\nwith religious fervor._] Confess your sin, Isaiah! Confess to God and\r\nmen, and make your peace and take your punishment. Forget that gold\r\nthat’s cursed and the voyage you be settin’ out on, and make your peace.\r\n[_Passionately._] I ask you to do this for my sake and the children’s,\r\nand your own most of all! I’ll get down on my knees, Isaiah, and pray\r\nyou to do it, as I’ve prayed to God to send you his grace! Confess and\r\nwash your soul of the stain o’ blood that’s on it. I ask you that,\r\nIsaiah--and God asks you--to make your peace with Him.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His face tortured by the inward struggle--as if the word\r\nstrangled him._] Confess and let someone steal the gold! [_This thought\r\ndestroys her influence over him in a second. His obsession regains\r\npossession of him instantly, filling him with rebellious strength. He\r\nlaughs harshly._] Ye’d make an old woman o’ me, would ye, Sarah?--an\r\nold, Sunday go-to-meetin’ woman snivvelin’ and prayin’ to God for\r\npardon! Pardon for what? Because two sneakin’ thieves are dead and done\r\nfor? I spoke no word, I tell ye--but if I had, I’d not repent it. What\r\nI’ve done I’ve done, and I’ve never asked pardon o’ God or men for ought\r\nI’ve done, and never will. Confess, and give up the gold I’ve dreamed of\r\nall my life that I’ve found at last! By thunder, ye must think I’m\r\ncrazed!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Seeming to shrivel up on her chair as she sees she has\r\nlost--weakly._] You be lost, Isaiah--no one can stop you.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Triumphantly._] Aye, none’ll stop me. I’ll go my course\r\nalone. I’m glad ye see that, Sarah.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Feebly trying to get to her feet._] I’ll go to home.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye’ll stay, Sarah. Ye’ve had your say, and I’ve listened to\r\nye; now I’ll have mine and ye listen to me. [MRS. BARTLETT _sinks back\r\nin her chair exhaustedly_. BARTLETT _continues slowly_.] The schooner\r\nsails at dawn on the full tide. I ask ye again and for the last time,\r\nwill ye christen her with your name afore she sails?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Firmly._] No.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Menacingly._] Take heed, Sarah, o’ what ye’re sayin’! I’m\r\nyour husband ye’ve sworn to obey. By right I kin order ye, not ask.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--I’ve never refused in anything that’s right--but this be\r\nwicked wrong.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--It’s only your stubborn woman’s spite makes ye refuse. Ye’ve\r\nchristened every ship I’ve ever been skipper on, and it’s brought me\r\nluck o’ a kind, though not the luck I wanted. And we’ll christen this\r\none with your own name to bring me the luck I’ve always been seekin’.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Resolutely._] I won’t, Isaiah.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye will, Sarah, for I’ll make ye. Ye force me to it.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Again trying to get up._] Is this the way you talk to\r\nme who’ve been a good wife to you for more than thirty years?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Commandingly._] Wait! [_Threateningly._] If ye don’t\r\nchristen her afore she sails, I’ll take Nat on the vige along with me.\r\n[MRS. BARTLETT _sinks back in her chair, stunned_.] He wants to go, ye\r\nknow it. He’s asked me a hundred times. He s’spects--’bout the gold--but\r\nhe don’t know for sartin. But I’ll tell him the truth o’ it, and he’ll\r\ncome with me, unless--\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Looking at him with terror-stricken\r\neyes--imploringly._] You won’t do that, Isaiah? You won’t take Nat away\r\nfrom me and drag him into sin? I know he’ll go if you give him the word,\r\nin spite of what I say. [_Pitifully._] You be only frightenin’ me! You\r\ncan’t be so wicked cruel as that.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I’ll do it, I take my oath--unless--\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_With hysterical anger._] Then I’ll tell him myself--of\r\nthe murders you did, and--\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Grimly._] And I’ll say ’twas done in fair fight to keep them\r\nfrom stealin’ the gold! I’ll tell him your’s is a woman’s notion, and\r\nhe’ll believe me, not you. He’s his father’s son, and he’s set to go. Ye\r\nknow it, Sarah. [_She falls back in the chair hopelessly staring at him\r\nwith horrified eyes. He turns away and adds after a pause._] So ye’ll\r\nchristen the Sarah Allen in the mornin’ afore she sails, won’t ye,\r\nSarah?\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_In a terrified tone._] Yes--if it’s needful to save\r\nNat--and God’ll forgive me when He sees my reason. But you--Oh, Isaiah!\r\n[_She shudders and then breaks down, sobbing._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_After a pause, turns to her humbly as if asking her\r\nforgiveness._] Ye mustn’t think hard o’ me that I want your name. It’s\r\nbecause it’s a good woman’s name, and I know it’ll bring luck to our\r\nvige. I’d find it hard to sail without it--the way things be.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Getting to her feet--in a state of feverish fear of\r\nhim._] I’m goin’ to home.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Going to her._] I’ll help ye to the top o’ the hill, Sarah.\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Shrinking from him in terror._] No. Don’t you touch me!\r\nDon’t you touch me! [_She hobbles quickly out of the door in the rear,\r\nlooking back frightenedly over her shoulder to see if he is following\r\nas_\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Curtain Falls_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n     SCENE--_Dawn of the following morning--exterior of the_ BARTLETT\r\n     _home, showing the main entrance, facing left, toward the harbor.\r\n     On either side of the door, two large windows, their heavy green\r\n     shutters tightly closed. In front of the door, a small porch, the\r\n     roof supported by four white column. A flight of three steps goes\r\n     up to this porch from the ground. Two paths lead to the steps\r\n     through the straggly patches of grass, one around the corner of the\r\n     house to the rear, the other straight to the left to the edge of\r\n     the cliff where there is a small projecting iron platform, fenced\r\n     in by a rail. The top of a steel ladder can be seen. This ladder\r\n     leads up the side or the cliff from the shore below to the\r\n     platform. The edge of the cliff extends from the left corner front,\r\n     half-diagonally back to the right, rear-center._\r\n\r\n     _In the grey half-light of the dawn_, HORNE, CATES, _and_ JIMMY\r\n     KANAKA _are discovered_. HORNE _is standing on the steel platform\r\n     looking down at the shore below_. CATES _is sprawled on the ground\r\n     nearby_. JIMMY _squats on his haunches, his eyes staring out to\r\n     sea as if he were trying to pierce the distance to the warm islands\r\n     of his birth_. CATES _wears dungarees_, JIMMY _dungaree pants and a\r\n     black jersey_; HORNE, _the same as in_ ACT TWO.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_With sluggish indifference._] Ain’t she finished with it yet?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Irritably._] No, damn her! I kin see ’em all together on the\r\nwharf at the bow o’ the schooner. That old crow o’ a woman o’ his! Why\r\nthe hell don’t she christen her and be done with it and let us make\r\nsail?\r\n\r\nCATES--[_After a pause._] Funny, ain’t it--his orderin’ us to come up\r\nhere and wait till it’s all done.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Angrily._] That’s her doin’, too. She thinks we ain’t good\r\nenough to be where she is. [_After a pause._] But there’s nothin’ funny\r\nto me that he does no more. He’s still out o’ his head, d’ye know that,\r\nCates?\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Stupidly._] I ain’t noticed nothin’ diff’rent ’bout him.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Scornfully._] He axed me if I ever seen them two in my\r\nsleep--that cook and the boy o’ the Triton. Said he did often.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Immediately protesting uneasily as if he had been accused._]\r\nThey was with us in the boat b’fore we fetched the island, that’s all\r\n’bout ’em I remember. I was crazy, after.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Looking at him with contempt._] So was we all crazy, for the\r\nmatter o’ that. I’ll not call ye a liar, Cates, but--a hell o’ a man ye\r\nbe! You wasn’t so out o’ your head that ye forgot the gold, was ye?\r\n\r\nCATES--[_His eyes glistening._] That’s diff’rent. Any man’d remember\r\nthat, even if he was crazy.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_With a greedy grin._] Aye. That’s the one thing I see in my\r\nsleep. [_Gloatingly._] We’ll dig it up soon now. In three months we’d\r\nought to be there--an’ then we’ll be rich, by Christ! [_There is the\r\nfaint sound of cries from the beach below._ HORNE _starts and turns to\r\nlook down again_.] They must ’a’ finished it. [CATES _and_ JIMMY _come\r\nto the edge to look down_.]\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Suddenly--with an eager childish curiosity._] That falla wife\r\nCaptain she make strong falla spell on ship, we sail fast, plenty good\r\nwind?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Contemptuously._] Aye, that’s as near as ye’ll come to it.\r\nShe’s makin’ a spell. Ye stay here, Jimmy, and tell us when the Old Man\r\nis comin’. [JIMMY _remains looking down_. HORNE _motions_ CATES _to\r\nfollow him, front--then in a low voice, disgustedly_.] Did ye hear that\r\ndamn fool nigger?\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Grumblingly._] Why the hell is the Old Man givin’ him a full\r\nshare? One piece o’ it’d be enough for a nigger like him.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Craftily._] There’s a way to get rid o’ him--if it comes to\r\nthat. He knifed them two, ye remember.\r\n\r\nCATES--Aye.\r\n\r\nHORNE--The two o’ us can take oath to that in any court.\r\n\r\nCATES--Aye.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_After a calculating look into his companion’s greedy\r\neyes--meaningly._] We’re two sane men, Cates--and the other two to share\r\nis a lunatic and a nigger. The skipper’s showed me where there’s a copy\r\no’ his map o’ the island locked up in the cabin--in case anything\r\nhappens to him I’m to bring back the gold to his woman, he says. [_He\r\nlaughs harshly._] Bring it back! Catch me! The fool! I’ll be open with\r\nye, Cates. If I could navigate and find the island myself I wouldn’t\r\nwait for a cracked man to take me there. No, be damned if I would! Me\r\nand you’d chance it alone someway or other.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Greedily._] The two o’ us--share and share alike! [_Then\r\nshaking his head warningly._] But he’s a hard man to git the best on.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Grimly._] And I be a hard man, too. And he’s not right in his\r\nhead. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for a chance. Something may turn\r\nup--and maybe--\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Turning to them._] Captain, he come. [CATES _and_ HORNE\r\n_separate hastily_. BARTLETT _climbs into sight up the ladder to the\r\nplatform. He is breathing heavily but his expression is one of\r\ntriumphant exultation._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Motions with his arms._] Down with ye and git aboard. The\r\nschooner’s got a name now--a name that’ll bring us luck. We’ll sail on\r\nthis tide.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Aye--aye, sir.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I got to wait here till they climb up the path. I’ll be aboard\r\nafore long. See that ye have her ready to cast off by then.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Aye--aye, sir. [_He and_ CATES _disappear down the ladder_. JIMMY\r\n_lingers, looking sidewise at his Captain_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Noticing him--gruffly but almost kindly._] What are ye\r\nwaitin’ for?\r\n\r\nJIMMY--[_Volubly._] That old falla wife belong you, Captain, she make\r\nstrong falla spell for wind blow plenty? She catch strong devil charm\r\nfor schooner, Captain?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Scowling._] What’s that, ye brown devil? [_Then suddenly\r\nlaughing harshly._] Yes--a strong spell to bring us luck. [_Roughly._]\r\nGit aboard, ye dog! Don’t let her find ye here with me. [JIMMY\r\n_disappears hurriedly down the ladder_. BARTLETT _remains at the edge\r\nlooking down after him. There is a sound of voices from the right and\r\npresently_ MRS. BARTLETT, SUE, DREW _and_ NAT _enter, coming around the\r\nhouse from the rear_. NAT _and_ DREW _walk at either side of_ MRS.\r\nBARTLETT, _who is in a state of complete collapse, so that they are\r\npractically carrying her_. SUE _follows, her handkerchief to her eyes_.\r\nNAT _keeps his eyes on the ground, his expression fixed and gloomy_.\r\nDREW _casts a glance of angry indignation at the Captain, who, after one\r\nindifferent look at them, has turned back to watch the operations on the\r\nschooner below_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As they reach the steps of the house--intent on the work\r\nbelow--makes a megaphone of his hands and shouts in stentorian tones._]\r\nLook lively there, Horne!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Protestingly._] Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Wheels about. When he meets his daughter’s eyes he controls\r\nhis angry impatience and speaks gently._] What d’ye want, Sue?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Pointing to her mother who is being assisted through the\r\ndoor--her voice trembling._] You mustn’t shout. She’s very sick.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Dully, as if he didn’t understand._] Sick?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Turning to the door._] Wait. I’ll be right back. [_She enters the\r\nhouse. As soon as she is gone all of_ BARTLETT’S _excitement returns. He\r\npaces up and down with nervous impatience._ NAT _comes out of the\r\nhouse_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_In a tone of anxiety._] Ma seems bad. We can’t do anything. I’m\r\ngoing for the doctor. [_As his father doesn’t seem to hear him--tapping\r\nhim on the shoulder, his voice breaking._] Why did you make her do it,\r\nPa? It was too much for her strength. Wouldn’t anyone else or any other\r\nname have done just as well?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Impatiently._] No. It had to be.\r\n\r\nNAT--When she spoke the words--and fell back in a faint--I thought she\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Vaguely._] Weakness. She’ll be all right again after a rest.\r\n[_He draws_ NAT’S _attention to the schooner_.] Smart lines on that\r\nschooner, boy. She’ll sail hell bent in a breeze. I knowed what I was\r\nabout when I bought her.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Staring down fascinatedly._] How long will the voyage take?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Preoccupied._] How long?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Insinuatingly._] To get to the island.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Three months at most--with fair luck. [_Exultantly._] And I’ll\r\nhave luck now!\r\n\r\nNAT--Then in six months you may be back--with _it_?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye, with--[_Stopping abruptly, turns and stares into his\r\nson’s eyes--angrily._] With what? What boy’s foolishness be ye talkin’?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Pleading fiercely._] I want to go, Pa! There’s no good in my\r\nstaying here any more. I can’t think of anything but--Oh, why don’t you\r\nbe fair and let me sail with you!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Sternly, to conceal his uneasiness._] Keep clear o’ this,\r\nboy, I’ve warned ye!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Appearing in doorway--indignantly._] Nat! Haven’t you gone for\r\nthe doctor yet?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Shame-facedly._] I forgot.\r\n\r\nSUE--Forgot!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Starting off._] I’m going, Sue. [_Then over his shoulder._] You\r\nwon’t sail before I come back, Pa? [BARTLETT _does not answer_. NAT\r\n_stands miserably hesitating_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--Nat! For heaven’s sake! [NAT _hurries off around the corner of the\r\nhouse, rear. Sue comes to her father who is watching her with a queer,\r\nhumble, hunted expression._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Well, Sue?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Her voice trembling._] Oh, Pa, how can you do such terrible\r\nthings. How could you drag Ma out of bed at dawn to christen your old\r\nboat--when you knew how sick she’s been!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Avoiding her eyes._] It’s only weakness. She’ll get well o’\r\nit soon.\r\n\r\nSUE--Pa! How can you say things like that--as if you didn’t care!\r\n[_Accusingly._] The way you’ve acted ever since you’ve been home almost,\r\nanyone would think--you _hated_ her!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Wincing._] No!\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Pa, what is it that has come between you? Can’t you tell me?\r\nCan’t I help to set things right again?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Mumblingly._] Nothin’--nothin’ ye kin help--nor me. Keep\r\nclear o’ it, Sue. Danny--ye think o’ him, that’s enough for ye.\r\n\r\nSUE--But things can’t go on like this. Don’t you see how it’s killing\r\nMa?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--She’ll forget her stubborn notions, now I be sailin’ away.\r\n\r\nSUE--But you’re not--not going for a while now, are you?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ain’t I been sayin’ I’d sail at dawn today? They’re makin’ her\r\nready to cast off. I’m waitin’ for Horne to hail.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Looking at him for a moment with shocked amazement._] But--you\r\ncan’t mean--right now!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Keeping his face averted._] Aye--or we’ll miss this tide.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Putting her hands on his shoulders and trying to look into his\r\nface._] Pa! You can’t mean that! [_His face is set with his obsessed\r\ndetermination. She lets her hands fall with a shudder._] You can’t be as\r\ncruel as that! Why, I thought, of course, you’d put off--[_Wildly._] You\r\nhave, haven’t you, Pa? You did tell those men you couldn’t sail when you\r\nsaw how sick Ma was, didn’t you--when she fainted down on the wharf?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Implacably._] I said I was sailin’ by this tide--and sail I\r\nwill, by thunder!\r\n\r\nSUE--Pa! [_Then pleadingly._] When the doctor comes and you hear what he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Roughly._] I ain’t stoppin’ on his word nor any man’s. I\r\nknow what’s best to do. [_Intensely._] That schooner’s been fit to sail\r\nthese two weeks past. I been waitin’ on her stubborn will [_he gestures\r\ntoward the house_], eatin’ my heart out day and night. Then I swore I’d\r\nsail today. I tell ye, Sue, I got a feelin’ in my bones if I don’t put\r\nout now I never will. Aye, I feel it deep down inside me. [_In a tone of\r\nsuperstitious awe._] And when she christened the schooner--jest to the\r\nminute, mind ye!--a fair breeze sprung up and come down out o’ the land\r\nto blow her out to sea--like a sign o’ good luck.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Aroused to angry indignation._] What kind of a man have you\r\nbecome--to think of such things now! Oh, I can’t believe you’re the same\r\nman who used to be my father!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Sue!\r\n\r\nSUE--To talk cold-bloodedly of sailing away on a long voyage when Ma’s\r\ninside--dying for all you seem to know or care! Oh, I hate you when\r\nyou’re like this! You’re not the father I love! You’ve changed into\r\nsomeone else--hateful and cruel--and I hate him, I hate him! [_She\r\nbreaks down, sobbing hysterically._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Who has listened to her with a face suddenly stricken by\r\nfear and torturing remorse._] Sue! Ye don’t know what ye be sayin’, do\r\nye?\r\n\r\nSUE--I do! You’re not the same to me any more--or to any of us. I’m\r\nafraid of you. And when you coldly propose to go away--now--I hate you,\r\nyes I do! And I hate those three awful men who make you act this way. I\r\nhate the schooner! I wish she and they were at the bottom of the sea!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Frenziedly--putting his hand over her mouth to stop her\r\nwords._] Stop, girl! Don’t ye dare--\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Shrinking away from him--frightenedly._] Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Bewilderedly, pleading for forgiveness._] Don’t heed that,\r\nSue--I didn’t mean--ye git me so riled--I’d not hurt ye for all the gold\r\nin the world. But don’t ye talk wrong o’ things ye can’t know on.\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Pa, what kind of things must they be--when you’re ashamed to\r\ntell them!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I ain’t ashamed. It ain’t that. On’y they be things a girl’s\r\nno call to meddle in. They be men’s business and I be man enough to\r\ncarry ’em out alone. Ye’ll know all they be to know--and your Ma and\r\nNat, too--when I come back from this vige. And the sooner I sail, the\r\nquicker I’ll be back to ye. Oh, ye’ll be glad enough then--when ye see\r\nwith your own eyes! Ye’ll bless me then ’stead o’ turning agin me!\r\n[_Hesitating for a second--then somberly._] On’y now--till it’s all over\r\nand done--ye’d best keep clear o’ it.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Passionately._] I don’t care--I don’t want to know anything about\r\nit. What I do know is that you can’t sail now. Oh, Pa, don’t you see\r\nyou can’t? Haven’t you any heart at all? Can’t you see how bad Ma is?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--It’s the sight o’ me sickens her. She’ll git better with me\r\naway from her.\r\n\r\nSUE--No. She needs you. She doesn’t want you to go. She called your name\r\njust a while ago--the only word she’s spoken since she christened the\r\nship. Come in to her, Pa! Tell her you won’t go!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Desperately._] I got to git away from her, I tell ye, Sue!\r\nShe’s been houndin’ me ever since I got back--houndin’ me with her\r\nstubborn tongue till she’s druv me mad, a’most! Ye’ve been on’y givin’\r\nthought to her, not me. They’s my side to it, too!\r\n\r\nSUE--I’ll talk to her, Pa. She can’t realize she’s hurting you or she\r\nwouldn’t--And then everything will be just the same as it used to be\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Shaking his head._] They be too much between. The only\r\nchance for that be my plan--to sail away and come back with--what I be\r\nseekin’. Then she’ll give over her stubborn naggin’--if she’s human\r\nwoman. It’s for her sake as much as my own I’m goin’--for her and you\r\nand Nat. [_With a sudden return of his old resolution._] I’ve made up my\r\nmind, I tell ye, and in the end ye’ll know I be right. [_A hail in_\r\nHORNE’S _voice comes thinly up from the shore below_. BARTLETT _starts,\r\nhis eyes gleaming_.] Ye hear? It’s Horne hailin’ me to come. They be\r\nready to cast off. I’ll git aboard. [_He starts for the ladder._]\r\n\r\nSUE--Pa! After all I’ve said--without one word of good-bye to Ma!\r\n[_Hysterically._] Oh, what can I do, what can I say to stop you! She\r\nhasn’t spoken but that one call for you. She hardly seems to breathe. If\r\nit weren’t for her eyes I’d believe she was dead--but her eyes look for\r\nyou. She’ll die if you go, Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--No!\r\n\r\nSUE--You might just as well kill her now in cold blood as murder her\r\nthat way!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Shaken--raising his hands as if to put them over his ears to\r\nshut out her words--hoarsely._] No! Ye lie! She’ll live till I git back\r\nand all’ll be as it was again!\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Appearing in the doorway, his face working with grief and\r\nanger--harshly._] Captain Bartlett! [_Then lowering his voice as he sees\r\nSue._] Mrs. Bartlett is asking to see you, Captain, before you go.\r\n\r\nSUE--There! Didn’t I tell you, Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Struggling with himself--dully._] She’s wantin’ to bound me\r\nagain, that be all.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Seeing him weakening--grasps his hand persuasively._] Pa! Come\r\nwith me. She won’t hound you. How silly you are! Come! [_Hesitatingly,\r\nhead bowed, he follows her toward the door._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As he comes to_ DREW _he stops and looks into the young\r\nman’s angry, accusing face. He mutters half mockingly._] So ye, too, be\r\nagin me, Danny?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Unable to restrain his indignation._] What man that’s a real man\r\nwouldn’t be against you, sir?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Frightenedly._] Danny! Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_In a sudden rage draws back his fist threateningly._ DREW\r\n_stares into his eyes unflinchingly_--BARTLETT _controls himself with an\r\neffort and lets his arm fall to his side--scornfully_.] Big words from a\r\nboy, Danny. I’ll forget them this time--on account o’ Sue. [_He turns to\r\nher._] I’m goin’ in to her to please ye, Sue--but if ye think any words\r\nthat she kin say’ll change my mind, ye make a mistake--for I be sailin’\r\nout as I planned I would in spite o’ all hell! [_He walks resolutely\r\ninto the house._ SUE _follows him after exchanging a hopeless glance\r\nwith_ DANNY.]\r\n\r\nDREW--[_To himself--with a shudder._] He’s mad, damn him! [_He paces up\r\nand down._ HORNE _appears on the ladder from below, followed by_ CATES.]\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Coming forward and addressing_ DREW.] Is the skipper about?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Curtly._] He’s in the house. You can’t speak to him now.\r\n\r\nHORNE--She’s ready to cast off. I hailed him from below but I ’spect he\r\ndidn’t hear. [_As_ DREW _makes no comment--impatiently_.] If he don’t\r\nshake a leg, we’ll miss the tide. There’s a bit o’ fair breeze, too.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Glancing at him resentfully._] Don’t count on his sailing today.\r\nIt’s just as likely he’ll change his mind.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Angrily._] Change his mind again? After us waitin’ and wastin’\r\ntime for weeks! [_To_ CATES _in a loud tone so_ DREW _can hear_.] What\r\ndid I tell ye, Cates? He’s crazy as hell.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Sharply._] What’s that?\r\n\r\nHORNE--I was tellin’ Cates the skipper’s not right in his head\r\n[_Angrily._] What man in his senses’d do the way he does?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Letting his resentment escape him._] That’s no lie, damn it!\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Surprised._] Aye, ye’ve seen it, too, have ye? [_After a\r\npause._] Now I axe ye, as a sailor, how’d ye like to be puttin’ out on a\r\nvige with a cracked man for skipper? [SUE _comes out of the door, stops\r\nwith a shudder of disgust as she sees the two sailors, and stands\r\nlistening. They do not notice her presence._]\r\n\r\nDREW--It seems to me a crazy voyage all round. What kind of trading is\r\nit you’re to do?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Suspiciously._] Ye’ll have to ask the skipper that.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_With a scornful shrug._] I was forgetting it’s such a dead\r\nsecret. That the craziest part, eh? [_With sudden interest as if a new\r\nidea had come to him._] But you know all about it, don’t you--what the\r\nCaptain plans to do on this voyage--and all that?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Dryly._] Aye, as well as himself--but I’m tellin’ no man.\r\n\r\nDREW--And I’m not asking. What do you suppose I care about any sneaking\r\ntrade deal in the Islands he may have up his sleeve? What I want to find\r\nout is: Do you know enough about this business to make this one voyage\r\nalone and attend to everything--in case the Captain can’t go?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Exchanging a quick glance with Cates--trying to hide his\r\neagerness._] Aye, I could do as well as any man alive. I’ve been sailin’\r\nthis sea for twenty year or more and I know the Island trade inside and\r\nout. He could trust me for it--and I’d make more money for him than he’s\r\nlikely to make with his head out o’ gear. [_Then scowling._] On’y\r\ntrouble is, who’d Captain her if he ain’t goin’?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Disappointedly._] Then you don’t know navigation enough for\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nHORNE--I’ve never riz above bo’sun. [_Then after a pause in which he\r\nappears to be calculating something--curiously._] Why d’ye ask me them\r\nquestions? [_Insinuatingly--almost in a whisper._] It can’t be done\r\n’less we got an officer like you aboard.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Angrily._] Eh? What’re you driving at? D’you think I--\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Who has been listening with aroused interest._] Danny! [_She\r\ncomes down to him._ HORNE _and_ CATES _bob their heads respectfully and\r\nmove back near the platform_. HORNE _watches_ SUE _and_ DREW _out of the\r\ncorner of his eye_.] Danny, I’ve been listening to what you were saying,\r\nbut I don’t understand. What are you thinking of?\r\n\r\nDREW [_Excitedly._] I was thinking--Listen, Sue! Seems to me from what I\r\nsaw your Pa’s out of his right mind, and, being that way, he’s sure\r\nbound to go unless someone or something steps in to stop him. D’you\r\nthink your Ma----?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Shaking her head--sadly._] No, I’m afraid anything she says will\r\nonly make things worse.\r\n\r\nDREW--Then you’ve no hope--? No more have I. Something’s got to be done\r\nto keep him home in spite of himself. Even leaving your Ma out of it,\r\nhe’s not in any fit state to take a ship to sea; and I was thinking if\r\nwe could fix it some way so that fellow Horne could take her out on this\r\nvoyage--\r\n\r\nSUE--But, Danny, Pa’d never give in to that.\r\n\r\nDREW--I wasn’t thinking he would. It’d have to be done on the sly.\r\nWe--you’d have to give the word--and keep him in the house somehow--and\r\nthen when he did come out it’d be too late. The schooner’d be gone.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Disturbed, but showing that this plan has caught her mind._]\r\nBut--would it be fair?--he’d never forgive--\r\n\r\nDREW--When he’s back in his right mind again, he would. [_Earnestly._]\r\nI’m not fond of lying and tricks myself, Sue, but this is a case where\r\nyou can’t pick and choose. You can’t let him sail, and wreck his ship\r\nand himself in the bargain, likely. Then, there’s your Ma----\r\n\r\nSUE--No, no, we can’t let him. [_With a glance at_ HORNE _and_ CATES.]\r\nBut I don’t trust those men.\r\n\r\nDREW--No more do I; but it would be better to chance them\r\nthan--[_Suddenly interrupting himself--with a shrug of his shoulders._]\r\nBut there’s no good talking of that. I was forgetting. None of them can\r\nnavigate. They couldn’t take her out.\r\n\r\nSUE--But didn’t I hear him say--if they had an officer on board--like\r\nyou--\r\n\r\nDREW--Yes, but where’ll you find one at a second’s notice?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Meaningly._] And you told me, didn’t you, that you’d just got\r\nyour master’s papers. Then you’re a captain by rights.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Looking at her with stunned astonishment._] Sue! D’you mean--\r\n\r\nSUE--[_A light coming over her face._] Oh, Danny, we could trust you!\r\nHe’d trust you! And after he’d calmed down I know he wouldn’t mind so\r\nmuch. Oh, Danny, it’ll break my heart to have you go, to send you away\r\njust after you’ve come back. But I don’t see any other way. I wouldn’t\r\nask--if it wasn’t for Ma being, this way--and him--Oh, Danny, can’t you\r\nsee your way to do it--for my sake?\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Bewilderedly._] Why, Sue, I--I never thought--[_Then as he sees\r\nthe look of disappointment which comes over her face at his\r\nhesitancy--resolutely._] Why sure, Sue, I’ll do it--if you want me to.\r\nI’ll do it if it can be done. But we’ve got to hustle. You stand in the\r\ndoor, Sue. You’ve got to keep him in the house some way if he aims to\r\ncome out. And I’ll talk to them. [SUE _goes to the doorway_. DREW _goes\r\nover to_ HORNE _and_ CATES.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_After listening._] He’s still in with Ma. It’s all right.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_To_ HORNE, _with forced joviality_.] How would you like me for\r\nskipper on this one voyage?\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Craftily._] Ye got your skipper’s papers all reg’lar?\r\n\r\nDREW--Yes, that part of it’s all right and square. Listen here. Miss\r\nSue’s decided her father isn’t in a fit state to Captain this trip. It’d\r\nmean danger for him and the schooner--and for you.\r\n\r\nHORNE--That’s no lie.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_To_ HORNE _protestingly_.] But if we git ketched the Old Man’ll\r\ntake it out o’ our hides, not his’n.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Savagely._] Shut up, ye fool! [_To_ DREW, _craftily_.] Cates is\r\nright, jest the same. Ye are as good as his married son and she’s his\r\ndaughter. He’d not blame you if things went wrong. He’d take it out on\r\nus.\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Impatiently._] I’ll shoulder all that risk, man!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Earnestly._] No harm will come to any of you, I promise you. This\r\nis all my plan, and I’ll tell my father I’m alone to blame.\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_In the tone of one clinching a bargain._] Then we’ll chance it.\r\n[_Warningly._] But it’s got to be done smart, sir. Ye’d best look\r\nlively.\r\n\r\nDREW--I’ve got to get my dunnage. I’ll be right back and we’ll tumble\r\naboard. [_He goes to the door._] Hold him, Sue, on some excuse if he’s\r\ncoming. Only a second now and it’ll all be safe. [_He goes into the\r\nhouse. She follows him in._]\r\n\r\nCATES--[_With stupid anger._] This is a hell o’ a mess we’re gettin’ in,\r\nif ye axe me.\r\n\r\nHORNE--And I tell ye it’s a great stroke o’ luck. It couldn’t o’ come\r\nout better.\r\n\r\nCATES--He’ll be aboard to spy on us.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Let him! What does he know? He thinks we’re goin’ tradin’, and\r\nthere’s no one to tell him diff’rent but me.\r\n\r\nCATES--He’ll know better afore long. He’ll s’pect--\r\n\r\nHORNE--’Bout the gold? He ain’t that kind. He’s a soft young swab o’ a\r\nlady steamer’s mate. Leave me to fool him. And when the time comes to\r\ngit rid o’ him, I’ll find a means some way or other. But can’t ye see,\r\nye fool, it’s luck to have him with us till we git clear o’ civilized\r\nports? He kin navigate and he’s got skipper’s papers that’ll come in\r\nhandy if there’s any trouble. And if anythin’ goes wrong at the start\r\nand we’re brung back, him and the girl’ll take the blame.\r\n\r\nCATES--[_Stupidly._] S’long as he don’t git no share o’ the gold----\r\n\r\nHORNE--[_Contemptuously._] Share, ye dumbhead! I’d see him in hell\r\nfirst--and send him there myself. [DREW _comes out of the house carrying\r\nhis bag which he hands to_ CATES. SUE _follows him_.]\r\n\r\nDREW--Look lively now! Let’s hustle aboard and get her under way.\r\n\r\nHORNE--Aye--aye, sir. [_He and_ CATES _clamber hurriedly down the\r\nladder_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Throwing her arms around his neck and kissing him._] Good-bye,\r\nDanny. It’s so fine of you to do this for us! I’ll never forget----\r\n\r\nDREW--[_Tenderly._] Ssssh! It’s nothing, Sue.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Tearfully._] Oh, Danny, I hope I’m doing right! I’ll miss you so\r\ndreadfully! But you’ll come back just as soon as you can--\r\n\r\nDREW--Of course!\r\n\r\nSUE--Danny! Danny! I love you so!\r\n\r\nDREW--And I guess you know I love you, don’t you? [_Kisses her._] And\r\nwe’ll be married when I come back this time _sure_?\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes--yes--Danny--sure!\r\n\r\nDREW--I’ve got to run. Good-bye, Sue.\r\n\r\nSUE--Good-bye, dear. [_They kiss for the last time and he disappears\r\ndown the ladder. She stands at the top, sobbing, following him with her\r\neyes._ NAT _comes around the house from the rear and goes to the front\r\ndoor_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Seeing his sister._] Sue! He hasn’t gone yet, has he? [_She\r\ndoesn’t hear him. He hesitates in the doorway for a moment, listening\r\nfor the sound of his father’s voice from inside. Then, very careful to\r\nmake no noise, he tiptoes carefully into the house._ SUE _waves her hand\r\nto_ DREW _who has evidently now got aboard the ship. Then she covers her\r\nface with her hands, sobbing_. NAT _comes out of the house again and\r\ngoes to his sister. As she sees him approaching, she dries her eyes\r\nhastily, trying to smile._]\r\n\r\nSUE--Did you get the doctor, Nat?\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes, he’s coming right away, he promised. [_Looking at her face._]\r\nWhat--have you been crying?\r\n\r\nSUE--No. [_She walks away from the edge of the cliff, drawing him with\r\nher._]\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes, you have. Look at your eyes.\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Nat, everything’s so awful! [_She breaks down again._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Trying to comfort her in an absentminded way._] There, don’t get\r\nworked up. Ma’ll be all right as soon as the doctor comes. [_Then\r\ncuriously._] Pa’s inside with her. They were arguing--have they made it\r\nup, d’you think?\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Nat, I don’t know. I don’t think so.\r\n\r\nNAT--The strain’s been too much for him--waiting and hiding his secret\r\nfrom all of us. What do you suppose it is, Sue--ambergris?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Wildly._] I don’t know and I don’t care! [_Noticing the strange\r\npreoccupied look in his eyes--trying to bring him back to\r\nearth--scornfully._] Ambergris! Are you going crazy? Don’t you remember\r\nyou’ve always been the first one to laugh at that silly idea?\r\n\r\nNAT--Well, there’s something---- [_Starts for the platform._ SUE _does\r\nher best to interpose to hold him back_.] Are they all ready on the\r\nschooner. He’ll have to hurry if she’s going to sail on this tide.\r\n[_With sudden passion._] Oh, I’ve got to go! I can’t stay here!\r\n[_Pleadingly._] Don’t you think, Sue, if you were to ask him for me\r\nhe’d--You’re the only one he seems to act sane with or care about any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nSUE--No! I won’t! I can’t!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Angrily._] Haven’t you any sense? Wouldn’t it be better for\r\neveryone if I went in his place?\r\n\r\nSUE--No. You know that’s a lie. Ma would lose her mind if you went.\r\n\r\nNAT--And I’ll lose mine if I stay! [_Half aware of_ SUE’S _intention to\r\nkeep him from looking down at the schooner--irritably_.] What are you\r\nholding my arm for, Sue? I want to see what they’re doing. [_He pushes\r\nher aside and goes to the platform--excitedly._] Hello, they’ve got the\r\nfores’l and mains’l set. They’re setting the stays’l. [_In amazement._]\r\nWhy--they’re casting off! She’s moving away from the wharf! [_More and\r\nmore excitedly._] I see four of them on board! Who--who is that, Sue?\r\n\r\nSUE--It’s Danny.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Furiously._] Danny! What right has he--when I can’t! Sue, call\r\nPa! They’re sailing, I tell you, you little fool!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Trying to calm him--her voice trembling._] Nat! Don’t be such a\r\ndonkey! Danny’s only going a little way--just trying the boat to see how\r\nshe sails while they’re waiting for Pa.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Uncertainly._] Oh. [_Then bitterly._] I was never allowed to do\r\neven that--his own son! Look, Sue, that must be Danny at the stern\r\nwaving.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Brokenly._] Yes. [_She waves her handkerchief over her head--then\r\nbreaks down, sobbing again. There is the noise of_ BARTLETT’S _voice\r\nfrom inside and a moment later he appears in the doorway. He seems\r\nterribly shattered, at the end of his tether. He hesitates uncertainly,\r\nlooking about him wildly as if he didn’t know what to do or where to\r\ngo._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_After one look at his face, runs to him and flings her arms about\r\nhis neck._] Pa! [_She weeps on his shoulder._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Sue, ye did wrong beggin’ me to see her. I knowed it’d do no\r\ngood. Ye promised she’d not hound me----“Confess,” she says--when they\r\nbe naught to tell that couldn’t be swore to in any court. “Don’t go on\r\nthis vige,” she says, “there be the curse o’ God on it.” [_With a note\r\nof baffled anguish._] She kin say that after givin’ the ship her own\r\nname! [_With wild, haggard defiance._] But curse or no curse, I be\r\ngoin’! [_He moves toward the platform_, SUE _clinging to his arm_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Frightenedly._] Pa! Go back in the house, won’t you?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I be sorry to go agin your will, Sue, but it’s got to be.\r\nYe’ll know the reason some day--and be glad o’ it. And now good-bye to\r\nye. [_With a sudden strange tenderness he bends and kisses his daughter.\r\nThen as she seems about to protest further, his expression becomes stern\r\nand inflexible._] No more o’ talk, Sue! I be bound out. [_He takes her\r\nhand off his arm and strides to the platform. One look down at the\r\nharbor and he stands transfixed--in a hoarse whisper._] What damned\r\ntrick be this? [_He points to the schooner and turns to_ NAT\r\n_bewilderedly_.] Ain’t that my schooner, boy--the Sarah Allen--reachin’\r\ntoward the p’int?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Surprised._] Yes, certainly. Didn’t you know? Danny’s trying her\r\nto see how she sails while they’re waiting for you.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With a tremendous sigh of relief._] Aye. [_Then angrily._]\r\nHe takes a lot o’ rope to himself without askin’ leave o’ me. Don’t he\r\nknow they’s no time to waste on boy’s foolin’? [_Then with admiration._]\r\nShe sails smart, don’t she, boy? I knowed she’d show a pair o’ heels.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_With enthusiasm._] Yes, she’s a daisy! Say, Danny’s taking her\r\npretty far out, isn’t he?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Anxiously._] He’d ought to come about now if he’s to tack\r\nback inside the p’int. [_Furiously._] Come about, damn ye! The swab!\r\nThat’s what comes o’ steamer trainin’. I’d sooner trust Sue to sail her\r\nnor him. [_Waves his arm and shouts._] Come about!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Bitterly._] He seems to be heading straight for the open sea.\r\nHe’s taking quite a sail, it seems to me.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_As if he couldn’t believe his eyes._] He’s passed the\r\np’int--and now--headin’ her out to sea--so’east by east. By God, that be\r\nthe course I charted for her! [SUE _bursts out sobbing. He wheels on\r\nher, his mouth fallen open, his face full of a stupid despair._] They be\r\nsomethin’ wrong here. What be it, Sue? What be it, Nat? [_His voice has\r\nbegun to quiver with passion._] That schooner--she’s sailin’ without\r\nme---- [_He suddenly springs at_ NAT _and grabs him by the throat--with\r\nhoarse fury, shaking him_.] What be it, ye whelp? It’s your\r\ndoin’--because I wouldn’t let ye go. Answer me!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Rushing to them with a scream._] Pa! [_She tugs frantically at\r\nhis hands._ BARTLETT _lets them fall to his side, stepping back from_\r\nNAT _who sinks weakly to the ground, gasping for breath_. BARTLETT\r\n_stands looking at him wildly_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--Nat didn’t know, Pa. It’s all my fault. I had to do it. There was\r\nno other way----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Raging._] What d’ye mean, girl? What is it ye’ve done? Tell\r\nme, I say! Tell me or I’ll----\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Unflinchingly._] You had to be stopped from going someway. You\r\nwouldn’t listen to reason. So I asked Danny if he wouldn’t make the trip\r\nin your place. He’s just got his captain’s papers--and oh, Pa, you can\r\ntrust him, you know that! That man Horne said he knows about everything\r\nyou wanted done, and he promised to tell Danny, and Danny’ll come\r\nback----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Chokingly._] So--that be it---- [_Shaking his clenched fist\r\nat the sky as if visualizing the fate he feels in all of this._] Curse\r\nye! Curse ye! [_He subsides weakly, his strength spent, his hand falls\r\nlimply at his side._]\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Appears in the doorway. Her face is pale with anguish.\r\nShe gives a cry of joy when she sees her son._] Nat! [_Then with a start\r\nof horror at her eyes fall on her husband._] Isaiah! [_He doesn’t seem\r\nto hear._] Then--you ain’t sailed yet?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Going to her--gently._] No, Ma, he isn’t going to sail. He’s\r\ngoing to stay home with you. But the schooner’s gone. See. [_She points\r\nand her mother’s eyes turn seaward._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Aloud to himself--in a tone of groping superstitious awe and\r\nbewildered fear._] They be somethin’ queer--somethin’ wrong--they be a\r\ncurse in this somewhere----\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Turning accusing eyes on him--with a sort of fanatical\r\ntriumph._] I’m glad to hear you confess that, Isaiah. Yes, there be a\r\ncurse--God’s curse on the wicked sinfulness o’ men--and I thank God He’s\r\nsaved you from the evil of that voyage, and I’ll pray Him to visit His\r\npunishment and His curse on them three men on that craft you forced me\r\nto give my name---- [_She has raised her hand as if calling down\r\nretribution on the schooner she can dimly see._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Terrified._] Ma!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Starting toward his wife with an insane yell of fury._] Stop\r\nit, I tell ye! [_He towers over her with upraised fist as if to crush\r\nher._]\r\n\r\nSUE--Pa!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Starting to his feet from where he has been sitting on the\r\nground--hoarsely._] Pa! For God’s sake!\r\n\r\nMRS. BARTLETT--[_Gives a weak, frightened gasp._] Would you murder me\r\ntoo, Isaiah? [_She closes her eyes and collapses in_ SUE’S _arms_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Tremblingly._] Nat! Help me! Quick! We must carry her to bed.\r\n[_They take their mother in their arms, carrying her inside the house._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_While they are doing this, rushes in his mad frenzy to the\r\nplatform over the edge of the cliff. He puts his hands to his mouth,\r\nmegaphone-fashion, and yells with despairing rage._] Ahoy! Ahoy! Sarah\r\nAllen! Put back! Put back! [_as_\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Curtain Falls_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n     SCENE--_About nine o’clock of a moonlight night one year\r\n     later_--CAPTAIN BARTLETT’S _“cabin,” a room erected on the top of\r\n     his house as a lookout post. The interior is fitted up like the\r\n     cabin of a sailing vessel. On the left, forward, a porthole.\r\n     Farther back, the stairs of the companionway. Still farther, two\r\n     more portholes. In the rear, left, a marble-topped sideboard. In\r\n     the rear, center, a door opening on stairs which lead to the lower\r\n     house. A cot with a blanket is placed against the wall to the right\r\n     of door. In the right wall, five portholes. Directly under them, a\r\n     wooden bench. In front of the bench, a long table with two chairs\r\n     placed, one in front, one to the left of it. A cheap, dark-colored\r\n     rug is on the floor. In the ceiling, midway from front to rear, a\r\n     skylight extending from opposite the door to above the left edge of\r\n     the table. In the right extremity of the skylight is placed a\r\n     floating ship’s compass. The light from the binnacle sheds down\r\n     over this and seeps into the room, casting a vague globular shadow\r\n     of the compass on the floor. Moonlight creeps in through the\r\n     portholes on the right. A lighted lantern is on the table._\r\n\r\n     _As the curtain rises_, SUE _and_ DOCTOR BERRY _are discovered\r\n     sitting by the table. The doctor is a man of sixty or so, hale and\r\n     hearty-looking, his white hair and mustache setting off his ruddy\r\n     completion. His blue eyes have a gentle expression, his smile is\r\n     kindly and sympathetic. His whole manner toward_ SUE _is that of\r\n     the old family doctor and friend, not the least of whose duties is\r\n     to play father-confessor to his patients. She is dressed in deep\r\n     mourning. She looks much older. Her face is pale and plainly marked\r\n     by the ravages of suffering and grief. But there is an excited\r\n     elation in her face at present, her eyes are alight with some\r\n     unexpected joy._\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Excitedly._] And here is Danny’s letter, Doctor--to prove it’s\r\nall true. [_She takes a letter from the bosom of her dress and holds it\r\nout to him._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Takes it with a smile, patting her hand._] I can’t say how\r\nglad I am, Susan. Coming after we’d all given him up for lost--it’s like\r\na miracle. Eh, well, I can hardly believe----\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Smiling happily._] Read what he says. Then you won’t doubt.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Hesitating--playfully._] I don’t know that it’s right for\r\nme--love letters at my age!\r\n\r\nSUE--Go ahead. I want you to read it. [_He reaches in his pocket for his\r\nspectacles._ SUE _continues gratefully_.] As if I could have any secrets\r\nfrom you after all you’ve done for us since Ma died. You’ve been the\r\nonly friend---- [_She stops, her lips trembling._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Tut-tut. [_He adjusts his spectacles and peers at her over\r\nthem._] Who wouldn’t be of all the service he could to a brave girl like\r\nyou--and I who’ve known you since you were so high! Eh, well, my dear\r\ngirl, this past year--with your mother’s death--the state your father’s\r\nin--and then the news of the schooner being reported lost--one damn\r\nthing on top of another! You’ve borne the whole brunt of it on your\r\nshoulders and stood up like a major. I’ll tell Danny when he comes he\r\nought to get down on his knees and thank God for getting such a wife!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Flushing._] You’re too good. I don’t deserve it. It was just a\r\ncase where someone had to carry things on.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Not many could have stood it--living in this house with him the\r\nway he is--even if he was their father.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Glancing up at the skylight--apprehensively._] Ssshh! He might\r\nhear you.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Listening intently._] Not him. There he goes pacing up and\r\ndown up there in the night, looking out to sea for that ship that will\r\nnever come back! And your brother Nat is getting just as bad. [_Shaking\r\nhimself._] Brrr! This house of mad dreams! It’s the crowning wonder to\r\nme you haven’t lost your balance too--spending nearly all of your time\r\nin this crazy cabin--afraid to go out--afraid of what he might do----\r\n\r\nSUE--Don’t you think Pa’ll come to realize the schooner is lost as time\r\ngoes by and she doesn’t come back?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--If he was going to realize that, the report of the facts five\r\nmonths ago would have convinced him. There it was, plain as the nose on\r\nyour face. British freighter reports finding derelict schooner. Steams\r\nnear enough to read the name on the stern--Sarah Allen, Harborport.\r\nWell, who could get around that evidence except a man with an obsession?\r\nNo, your father won’t let himself look the facts in the face. If he did,\r\nprobably the shock of it would kill him. That darn dream of his has\r\nbecome his life. No, Susan, as time goes on he’ll believe in it harder\r\nand harder. After observing him for the past year--and I speak for his\r\nown sake, too, as his good friend for twenty years or more--my final\r\nadvice is the same: Send him to an asylum.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With a shudder._] No, Doctor.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Shaking his head._] You’ll have to come to it in time. He’s\r\ngetting worse. No one can tell--he might get violent----\r\n\r\nSUE--How can you say that? You know how gentle and sane he is with\r\nme--just like he used to be in the old days.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--You’re his last connecting link with things as they are--but\r\nthat can’t last. On the other hand, I think that if we got him away from\r\nthe sea, from this house, especially from this crazy cabin and the\r\nship’s deck he had built up there--[_He nods upward._]--that perhaps----\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With conviction._] No. It would kill him to leave it.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Eh, well, my dear, one thing you’ve got to realize: Your father\r\nand Nat must be separated somehow. Nat’s going to pieces. He’s lost his\r\njob, he moons about this house, he takes no interest in anything but\r\nthis craziness. I’ll bet he doesn’t believe that schooner is lost any\r\nmore than your father does.\r\n\r\nSUE--You mean he still hopes it may not be true. That’s only natural.\r\nHe’s in San Francisco now tracing down the report again. He saw in the\r\npapers where the British freighter that found the derelict was in port\r\nagain and he went to talk with the people on board. I’m hoping he’ll\r\ncome back fully convinced, with the whole thing out of his mind.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Shaking his head--gravely._] I’ve watched him and talked with\r\nhim---- Why, even your father seems to realize, in his twisted way, that\r\nhe has a bad effect on Nat.\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes, as I’ve told you before, he hasn’t spoken to Nat alone since\r\nthe schooner sailed a year ago. And Nat sneaks about trying to spy on\r\nhim--and I have to be always on the watch to keep them apart---- It’s\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--You’ve got to persuade Nat to go away, Susan.\r\n\r\nSUE--He won’t heed me--but I was thinking that now Danny is coming back,\r\nI’d get him----\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--There’s another thing. You can’t continue to play slave to these\r\ntwo after you’re married.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Miserably._] We’ll have to wait a while longer----\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Roughly._] Rats! You can’t sacrifice any more of your life and\r\nDanny’s to mad dreams.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Helplessly._] I don’t know---- [_Then brightening._] That’ll all\r\nbe decided when the time comes. Just now it’s enough to know Danny’s\r\nalive and coming back. Read his letter, Doctor. You’ve been holding it\r\nin your hand all this time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Yes, yes, let’s see. [_He takes the letter from the envelope._]\r\n\r\nSUE--Poor Danny! He’s been through terrible things.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Hmm! Rangoon.\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes, he’s still in the hospital there. You’ll see.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Reads the letter--grunts with astonishment--angrily._] By\r\nGad! The damn scoundrels!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Shuddering._] Yes, wasn’t it hideous--those awful men stabbing\r\nhim and leaving him for dead in that out of the way native settlement!\r\nThe natives nursed him back to life, have you got that far yet? And then\r\nhe was laid up for four months there waiting for a vessel to touch and\r\ntake him back to civilization. And then, think of it, getting the fever\r\non top of all that and nearly dying in the hospital in Rangoon!\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--A terrible time of it! He’s lucky to be alive. Hmm. I see he\r\nforesaw the wreck of the schooner. Those brutes couldn’t navigate.\r\n[_Folding the letter and putting it back._] He doesn’t seem to have\r\nfound out what the purpose of that mad trip was. Horne hid it from him\r\nto the last, he says. Well, it’s queer--damn queer. But I’m glad to know\r\nthose wretches have gone to their final accounting.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_With a shudder._] I was always afraid of them. They looked\r\nlike--murderers. [_At a noise from below they both start. Steps can be\r\nheard climbing the stairs._ SUE _jumps to her feet frightenedly_.]\r\nWhy--do you hear--who can that be? [_There is a soft rap on the door.\r\nThe Doctor jumps to his feet._ SUE _turns to him with a half-hysterical\r\nlaugh_.] Shall I open? I don’t know why--but I’m afraid.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Tut-tut! I’ll see who it is. [_He opens the door and_ NAT _is\r\ndiscovered on the stairs outside_.] Why hello, boy. You gave us a\r\nscare. Susan thought it was a ghost knocking.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Comes into the room. He has aged, grown thin, his face gaunt and\r\ndrawn from continual mental strain, his eyes moody and preoccupied. He\r\nglances up at the skylight apprehensively, then turns to_ SUE.] I didn’t\r\nfind you downstairs so I---- [_Then to the Doctor._] Yes, you do grow to\r\nlook for ghosts in this house, don’t you? [_Again glancing upward._]\r\nHe’s up there as usual, I suppose--looking for a ship that’ll _never,\r\nnever come now_!\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_With a grunt of approval._] I’m glad to hear you acknowledge\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Who is just recovering from her fright._] But, Nat, I didn’t\r\nexpect you---- Did you find out----?\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes, I talked with several of the men who were on board at the\r\ntime. They said they steamed in so close to the schooner it was easy to\r\nread the name with the naked eye. All agreed--Sarah Allen, Harborport.\r\nThey even remembered how her tafrail was painted. There’s no chance for\r\nmistake. The Sarah Allen is gone. [_With great emphasis._] And I’m\r\nglad--damn glad! I feel as if a weight of lead had been taken off my\r\nbrain. I feel free again, and I can go back to work--but not here. I’ve\r\ngot to go away--start new altogether.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Happily, coming and putting her arms around him._] It’s so good\r\nto hear you talk like your old self again.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Earnestly._] Yes, Nat, by Gad, that’s sound sense. Get out of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Giving him a queer look._] I suppose you thought I was doomed,\r\neh?--like him. [_He makes a motion upward--then with an uncertain\r\nlaugh._] A doctor’s always looking for trouble where there isn’t any.\r\n[_In a tone of finality._] Well, it’s all over, anyway.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Snatching the letter from the table._] Oh, I was forgetting, Nat.\r\nRead this. I got it yesterday.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Turns it over in his hands suspiciously._] Who from?\r\n\r\nSUE--Open it and see.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Does so and turns over the pages to read the signature--he gives\r\na start--hoarsely._] Danny! It can’t be! But it’s his writing sure\r\nenough! [_He exclaims with a sudden wild exultation._] Then they must\r\nhave been lying to me!\r\n\r\nSUE--No, the Sarah Allen was wrecked all right, but that was afterwards.\r\nHe wasn’t on board then. Read it. You’ll see. [NAT _sinks back on a\r\nchair, evidently depressed by this information. He starts to read the\r\nletter with unconcealed indifference, then becomes engrossed, excited,\r\nthe paper trembling in his hands. The Doctor shakes his head at_ SUE\r\n_indicating his disapproval of her giving him the letter_. NAT\r\n_finishes and springs to his feet--angrily_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--The stupid fool! He let Horne pull the wool over his eyes in fine\r\nshape. He deserved all he got for being so dumb!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Indignantly._] Nat!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Unheedingly._] Oh, if I could only have gone in his place! I knew\r\nthe kind Horne was. He couldn’t have played that trick on me. I’d have\r\nforced the secret out of him if I had to---- [_He raises his clenched\r\nfist in a gesture of threat like his father’s--then lets it fall and\r\nsits down again--disgustedly._] But what’s the use? And what’s the use\r\nof this? [_Tosses the letter contemptuously on the table._] He might\r\njust as well not have written. We’re no wiser than we were before.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Snatching up the letter--deeply hurt._] Aren’t you even glad to\r\nhear Danny’s alive?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Turning to her at once--with remorseful confusion._] Yes--yes--of\r\ncourse, Sue--I don’t have to say that, do I? What I mean is, he never\r\nfound out from Horne--and we’re no wiser.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--[_Briskly--with a significant glance at_ SUE.] Well,\r\nSusan--Nat--I’ve got to run along--[_Meaningly._] I’ll be over again\r\ntomorrow, Susan.\r\n\r\nSUE--Yes, do come. [_Goes with him to the door._] Can you see your way?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR--Yes. Good night.\r\n\r\nSUE--Good night. [_She closes the door and comes back to_ NAT. _The\r\nDoctor’s footsteps die out._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Savagely._] That damned old fool! What is he doing, sneaking\r\naround here all the time? I’ve grown to hate the sight of him.\r\n\r\nSUE--Nat! You can’t mean that. Think of how kind he’s been.\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes--kindness with a purpose.\r\n\r\nSUE--Don’t be silly. What purpose could he have except wanting to help\r\nus?\r\n\r\nNAT--To find out things, of course, you simpleton. To pump Pa when he’s\r\nnot responsible for what he’s saying.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Indignantly._] Nat!\r\n\r\nNAT--Much good it’s done him! I know Pa. Sane or not, he won’t tell\r\n_that_ to anyone--not even you or me, Sue. [_With sudden fury._] I’m\r\ngoing away--but before I go I’m going to make him tell me! He won’t\r\nrefuse this time when he knows I’m leaving for good. He’ll be glad then.\r\nHe’s been so afraid I’d find out, so scared to speak to me even--locking\r\nhimself up here. But I’ll make him tell--yes, I will!\r\n\r\nSUE--Careful, Nat. He’ll hear you if you shout like that.\r\n\r\nNAT--But we have a right to know--his own children. What if he dies\r\nwithout ever speaking?\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Uneasily._] Be sensible, Nat. There’s nothing to tell except in\r\nyour imagination. [_Taking his arm--persuasively._] Come on downstairs.\r\nI’ll get you something to eat. You must be starved, aren’t you?\r\n\r\nNAT--No--I don’t know--I suppose I ought to be. [_He gets to his feet\r\nand glances around with a shudder._] What a place for him to build to\r\nwait in--like the cabin of a ship sunk deep under the sea--like the\r\nSarah Allen’s cabin as it is now, probably. [_With a shiver._] There’s a\r\nchill comes over you. No wonder he’s mad. [_He listens._] Hear him. A\r\nyear ago today she sailed. I wonder if he knows that. Back and forth,\r\nalways staring out to sea for the Sarah Allen. Ha-ha! God! It would be\r\nfunny if it didn’t make your flesh creep. [_Brusquely._] Come on. Let’s\r\nleave him and go down where there’s light and warmth. [_They go down the\r\nstairs, closing the door behind them. There is a pause. Then the door of\r\nthe companionway above is heard being opened and shut. A gust of wind\r\nsweeps down into the room._ BARTLETT _stamps down the stairs. The\r\nmadness which has taken almost complete possession of him in the past\r\nyear is clearly stamped on his face, particularly in his eyes which seem\r\nto stare through and beyond objects with a hunted, haunted expression.\r\nHis movements suggest an automaton obeying invisible wires. They are\r\nquick, jerky, spasmodic. He appears to be laboring under a state of\r\nextraordinary excitement. He stands for a second at the foot of the\r\nstairs, peering about him suspiciously. Then he goes to the table and\r\nsits down on the edge of a chair, his chin supported on his hands._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Takes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and spreads it\r\nout on the table in the light of the lantern--pointing with his\r\nfinger--mumblingly._] Where the cross be--ye’ll not forget that, Silas\r\nHorne. Ye had a copy o’ this--no chance for a mistake, bullies--the\r\ngold’s there, restin’ safe--back to me and we’ll share it fair and\r\nsquare. A year ago today--ye remember the orders I wrote ye, Horne.\r\n[_Threateningly._] Ye’ll not be gone more nor a year or I’ll--and if ye\r\nmake port to home here at night, hang a red and a green light at the\r\nmainm’st head so I’ll see ye comin.’ A red and a green---- [_He\r\nsprings up suddenly and goes to a porthole to look out at the\r\nsea--disappointedly._] No light be there--but they’ll come. The year be\r\nup today and ye’ve got to come or I’ll---- [_He sinks back on the chair,\r\nhis head in his hands. Suddenly he starts and stares straight in front\r\nof him as if he saw something in the air--with angry defiance._] Aye,\r\nthere ye be again--the two o’ ye! Makin’ a mock o’ me! Brass and junk,\r\nye say, not worth a damn! Ye don’t believe, do ye? I’ll show ye! [_He\r\nsprings to his feet and makes a motion as if grabbing someone by the\r\nthroat and shaking them--savagely._] Ye lie! Is it gold or no? Answer\r\nme! [_With a mocking laugh._] Aye, ye own up to it now, right enough.\r\nToo late, ye swabs! No share for ye! [_He sinks back on the chair\r\nagain--after a pause, dully._] Jimmy’s gone. Let them rot. But I spoke\r\nno word, Silas Horne, remember! [_Then in a tone of fear._] Be ye dyin’,\r\nSarah? No, ye must live--live to see your ship come home with the\r\ngold--and I’ll buy ye all in the world ye set your heart on. No, not\r\nambergris, Sarah--gold and diamonds and sech! We’re rich at last! [_Then\r\nwith great anguish._] What woman’s stubborn talk be this? Confess, ye\r\nsay? But I spoke no word, I swear to ye! Why will ye hound me and think\r\nevil o’ what I done? Men’s business, I tell ye. They would have killed\r\nus and stolen the gold, can’t ye see? [_Wildly._] Enough o’ talk, Sarah!\r\nI’ll sail out in spite o’ ye! [_He gets to his feet and paces up and\r\ndown the room. The door in the rear is opened and_ NAT _re-enters. He\r\nglances at his father, then looks down the stairs behind him cautiously\r\nto see if he is followed. He comes in and closes the door behind him\r\ncarefully._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_In a low voice._] Pa! [_Then as his father does not appear to\r\nnotice his presence--louder._] Pa!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Stops short and stares at his son as if he were gradually\r\nawakening from a dream--slowly._] Be that ye, Nat?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Coming forward._] Yes. I want to talk with you.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Struggling to bring his thoughts under control._] Talk? Ye\r\nwant to talk--to me? Men’s business--no room for a boy in it--keep clear\r\no’ this.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Defiantly._] That’s what you’ve always said. But I won’t be put\r\noff any longer. I won’t, do you hear?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Angrily._] I’ve ordered ye not to set foot in this cabin o’\r\nmine. Git below where ye belong. Where’s Sue? I told her to keep ye\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNAT--She can’t prevent me this time. I’ve made up my mind. Listen, Pa.\r\nI’m going away tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Uncertainly._] Goin’ away?\r\n\r\nNAT--Yes, and I’m never coming back. I’m going to start a new life.\r\nThat’s why I want a final talk with you--before I go.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Dully._] I’ve naught to say to ye.\r\n\r\nNAT--You will have. Listen. I’ve absolute proof the Sarah Allen is lost.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Fiercely._] Ye lie!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Curiously._] Why do you say that? You know it’s true. It’s just\r\nthat you _won’t believe_.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Wanderingly--the word heading his mind into another\r\nchannel._] Believe? Aye, he wouldn’t believe. Brass and junk, he said,\r\nnot worth a damn--but in the end I made him own up ’twas gold.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Repeating the word fascinatedly._] Gold?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--A year ago today she sailed. Ye lie! Ye don’t believe either,\r\ndo ye?--like him. But I’ll show ye! I’ll make ye own up as I made him!\r\n[_With mad exultation._] She’s comin’ home tonight as I ordered Horne\r\nshe must! I kin feel her makin’ for home, I tell ye! A red an’ a green\r\nat the mainm’sthead if ye make port o’ night, I ordered Horne. Ye’ll\r\nsee! [_He goes to look out of a porthole._ NAT, _as if under a spell,\r\ngoes to another_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Turning away disappointedly--making an effort to throw off his\r\nthoughts--without conviction._] Nonsense. There’s nothing there--no\r\nlights--and I don’t believe there ever will be.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His wild eyes fixed on his son’s with an intense effort of\r\nwill as if he were trying to break down his resistance._] Ye’ll see, I\r\ntell ye--a red and a green! It ain’t time yet, boy, but when it be\r\nthey’ll be plain in the night afore your eyes. [_He goes and sits down\r\nby the table._ NAT _follows him and sits down in the other chair. He\r\nsees the map and stares at it fascinatedly._]\r\n\r\nNAT--What is this--the map of the island? [_He reaches out his hand for\r\nit._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Snatching it up--with a momentary return to\r\nreason--frightenedly._] Not for ye, boy. Keep clear o’ this for your own\r\ngood. [_Then with a crazed triumph._] Aye! Ye’d believe this soon\r\nenough, wouldn’t ye?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Intensely._] I’ve always believed there was something--and a\r\nmoment ago you mentioned gold. [_Triumphant in his turn._] So you\r\nneedn’t try to hide the secret any longer. I know now. It’s gold--gold\r\nyou found on that island--gold you fitted out the Sarah Allen to sail\r\nback for--gold you buried where I saw that cross marked on the map!\r\n[_Passionately._] Why have you been afraid to confide in me, your own\r\nson? Why didn’t you let me sail back in your place? Were you afraid I’d\r\ngive the secret away? Did you think I wouldn’t believe----?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With a mad chuckle._] Aye, ye believe now, right enough.\r\n\r\nNAT--I always believed, I tell you. [_Pleadingly._] And now that I know\r\nso much why can’t you tell me the rest? I must know! I have a right to\r\nbe heir to the secret. Why don’t you confess----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Interrupting--his brain catching at the word._] Confess?\r\nConfess, did ye say, Sarah? To Nat, did ye mean? Aye, Sarah, I’ll tell\r\nhim all and leave it to him to say if I did wrong. [_His gleaming eyes\r\nfixed on his son’s._] I’ll tell ye, boy, from start to finish o’ it. I\r\nbeen eatin’ my heart to tell someone--someone who’d believe--someone\r\nthat’d say I did no wrong. Listen, boy, ye know o’ our four days in an\r\nopen boat after the Triton went down. I told ye o’ that when I come\r\nhome. But what I didn’t tell ye was they was six o’ us in that boat, not\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nNAT--Six? There were you and Horne and Cates and Jimmy----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--The cook o’ the Triton and the ship’s boy. We’d been on the\r\nisland two days--an island barren as hell, mind--without food or drink.\r\nWe was roasted by the sun and nigh mad with thirst. Then, on the second\r\nday, I seed a Malay canoe--a proper war canoe such as the pirates\r\nuse--sunk down inside the reef. I sent Jimmy down to go over her\r\nthinkin’ they might be some cask o’ water in her the sea’d not got to.\r\n[_With impressive emphasis._] He found no water, boy, but he did\r\nfind--d’ye know what, boy?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Exultantly._] The gold, of course!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Laughing harshly._] Ha-ha! Ye do believe right enough, don’t\r\nye! Aye, the gold--in a chest. We hauled her up ashore and forced the\r\nlid open. [_Gloatingly._] And there it was afore our eyes in the\r\nsun--gold bracelets and rings and ornaments o’ all sorts fixed up fancy\r\nwith diamonds and emeralds and rubies and sech--red and green--shinin’\r\nin the sun! [_He stops impressively._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Fascinatedly._] Diamonds and---- But how did they get there?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Looted treasure o’ some Chinese junk, likely. What matter how\r\nit come about? There it was afore our eyes. And then, mind ye, that\r\nthief o’ a cook came runnin’ up from where he’d been shirkin’ to look at\r\nwhat we’d found. “No share for ye, ye swab,” I yelled at him; and then\r\nhe says: “It ain’t gold--brass and junk,” he says and run off for fear\r\no’ me. Aye, he run off to the boy and told him to jine with his sneakin’\r\nplan to steal the gold from us!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Savagely._] But why didn’t you stop him? Why didn’t you----?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--I be comin’ to that, boy, and ye’ll see if I did wrong. We\r\ncarried the chest to the shade o’ a palm and there was that thief o’ a\r\ncook an’ the boy waitin’. I collared ’em both and made ’em look at the\r\ngold. “Look and tell me if it’s gold or no,” I says. [_Triumphantly._]\r\nThey was afeerd to lie. Even that thief o’ a cook owned up ’twas gold.\r\nThen when I turned ’em loose, because he knowed he’d git no share, he\r\nshouted again: “Brass and junk. Not worth a damn.”\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Furiously._] But why did you allow---- Why didn’t you----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With mad satisfaction._] Aye, ye be seein’ the way o’ it,\r\nboy. It was just then we sighted the schooner that picked us up after.\r\nWe made a map and was burryin’ the gold when we noticed them two thieves\r\nsneakin’ about to see where we’d hide it. I saw ’em plain, the scum!\r\nThat thief o’ a cook was thinkin’ he’d tell the folks on the schooner\r\nand go shares with them--and leave us on the island to rot; or he was\r\nthinkin’ he and the boy’d be able to come back and dig it up afore I\r\ncould. We had to do somethin’ quick to spile their plan afore the\r\nschooner come. [_In a tone of savage satisfaction._] And so--though I\r\nspoke no word to him--Jimmy knifed ’em both and covered ’em up with\r\nsand. But I spoke no word, d’ye hear? Their deaths be on Jimmy’s head\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Passionately._] And what if you had? They deserved what they got.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Then ye think I did no wrong?\r\n\r\nNAT--No! Any man--I’d have done the same myself.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Gripping his son’s hand tensely._] Ye be true son o’ mine,\r\nNat. I ought to told ye before. [_Exultantly._] Ye hear, Sarah? Nat says\r\nI done no wrong.\r\n\r\nNAT--The map! Can I see it?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Aye. [_He hands it to_ NAT _who spreads it out on the table\r\nand pores over it_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Excitedly._] Why, with this I--we--can go back--even if the Sarah\r\nAllen is lost.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--She ain’t lost, boy--not her. Don’t heed them lies ye been\r\nhearin’. She’s due now. I’ll go up and look. [_He goes up the\r\ncompanionway stairs._ NAT _does not seem to notice his going, absorbed\r\nin the map. Then there is a loud muffled hail in_ BARTLETT’S _voice_.]\r\n“Sarah Allen, ahoy!” [NAT _starts, transfixed--then rushes to one of the\r\nportholes to look. He turns back, passing his hand over his eyes,\r\nfrowning bewilderedly. The door above is flung open and slammed shut\r\nand_ BARTLETT _stamps down the stairs_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Fixing_ NAT _hypnotically with his eyes--triumphantly_.]\r\nWhat did I tell ye? D’ye believe now she’ll come back? D’ye credit your\r\nown eyes?\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Vaguely._] Eyes? I looked. I didn’t see----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye lie! The Sarah Allen, ye blind fool, come back from the\r\nSouthern Seas as I swore she must! Loaded with gold as I swore she would\r\nbe!--makin’ port!--droppin’ her anchor just when I hailed her.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Feebly, his will crumbling._] But--how do you know?--some other\r\nschooner----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Not know my own ship--and the signal I’d ordered Horne to\r\nmake!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Mechanically._] I know--a red and a green at the mainm’sthead.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Then look out if ye dare! [_He goes to a porthole._] Ye kin\r\nsee it plain from here. [_Commandingly._] Will ye believe your eyes?\r\nLook! [NAT _comes to him slowly--looks through the porthole--and starts\r\nback, a possessed expression coming over his face_.]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Slowly._] A red and a green--clear as day!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_His face is now transfigured by the ecstasy of a dream come\r\ntrue._] They’ve lowered a boat--the three--Horne an’ Cates and Jimmy\r\nKanaka. They’re rowin’ ashore. Listen. I hear the oars in the locks.\r\nListen!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Staring into his father’s eyes--after a pause during which he\r\nappears to be straining his hearing to the breaking point--excitedly._]\r\nI hear!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Listen! They’ve landed. They’ll be comin’ up the path now.\r\n[_In a crooning, monotonous tone._] They move slowly--slowly. It be\r\nheavy, I know--that chest. [_After a pause._] Hark! They’re below at the\r\ndoor in front.\r\n\r\nNAT--I hear!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Ye’ll see it now in a moment, boy--the gold. Up with it,\r\nbullies! Up ye come! Up, bullies! It’s heavy, heavy!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Madly._] I hear them! They’re on the floor below! They’re coming!\r\nI’ll open the door. [_He springs to the door and flings it open,\r\nshouting._] Welcome home, boys! [SUE _is discovered outside just\r\nclimbing up the stairs from below. She steps inside, then stops, looking\r\nwith amazement and horror from father to brother._ NAT _pushes her\r\nroughly aside to look behind her down the stairs_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--Nat!\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Turning to his father._] I’ll go down to the wharf. They must be\r\nthere or---- [_The rest of his words are lost as he hurries down the\r\nstairs._ BARTLETT _steps back, shrinking away from his daughter, and\r\nsinks on a chair by the table with a groan, his hands over his eyes._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Comes to him and shakes him by the shoulder--alarmed._] Pa! What\r\nhas happened? What is the matter with Nat? What have you told him?\r\n[_With bitter despair._] Oh, can’t you see you’re driving him mad, too?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Letting his hands fall and staring at her\r\nhaggardly--falteringly, as if reason were slowly filtering back into his\r\nbrain._] Sue--ye said--drivin’ him mad, _too_! Then ye think I be----?\r\n[_He staggers to his feet._ SUE _breaks down, sobbing_. BARTLETT\r\n_falters on_.] But I seen her--the Sarah Allen--the signal lights----\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Pa, there’s nothing there! You know it! She was lost months\r\nago.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--Lost? [_He stumbles over to a porthole and looks out. His body\r\nsags as if he were going to fall. He turns away and cries hopelessly in\r\na tone of heart-rending grief._] Lost! Aye, they be no Sarah Allen\r\nthere--no lights--nothin’!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Pleading fiercely._] Pa, you’ve got to save Nat! He won’t heed\r\nanyone else. Can’t you tell him the truth--the whole truth whatever it\r\nis--now when I’m here and you’re yourself again--and set him free from\r\nthis crazy dream!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_With wild grief._] Confess, ye mean? Sue, ye be houndin’ me\r\nlike your Ma did to her dyin’ hour! Confess--that I spoke the word to\r\nJimmy--in my mind! Confess--brass and junk--not worth a damn! [_In\r\nfrenzied protest._] No! Ye lie!\r\n\r\nSUE--Oh, Pa, I don’t know what you mean. Tell Nat the truth! Save him!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--The truth? It’s a lie! [_As_ SUE _tries to bar his way to the\r\ncompanionway--sternly_.] Out o’ my way, girl! [_He pulls himself feebly\r\nup the stairs. The door is heard slamming above._ SUE _sits down in a\r\nchair in a hopeless, exhausted attitude. After a pause_ NAT _re-enters.\r\nHe is panting heavily from his exertions. His pale face is set in an\r\nexpression of despair._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Looking about the room wildly._] Where is he? Sue! [_He comes\r\nforward and falls on his knees beside her chair, hiding his face in her\r\nlap like a frightened child. He sobs hoarsely._] Sue! What does it all\r\nmean? I looked. There was nothing there--no schooner--nothing.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Soothing him as if he were a little boy._] Of course there\r\nwasn’t. Did you expect there would be, you foolish boy? Come, you know\r\nbetter than that. Why, Nat, you told the doctor and I that you were\r\nabsolutely convinced the Sarah Allen was lost.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Dully._] Yes, I know--but I don’t believe--like him----\r\n\r\nSUE--Sshhhh! You know the state Pa is in. He doesn’t realize what he’s\r\nsaying half the time. You ought to have better sense than to pay any\r\nattention----\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Excitedly._] But he told me all he’s been hiding from us--all\r\nabout the gold!\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Looking at him with alarm--mystified._] Gold? [_Then forcing a\r\nsmile._] Don’t be silly, Nat. It doesn’t exist except in his poor,\r\nderanged mind.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Fiercely._] That’s a lie, Sue! I saw the map, I tell you--the map\r\nof the island with a cross marked on it where they buried the gold.\r\n\r\nSUE--He showed a map to you--a real map? [_Gently._] Are you sure you’re\r\nnot just imagining that, too?\r\n\r\nNAT--I had it in my hands, you fool, you! There--on the table. [_He\r\nsprings to his feet, sees the map on the table, and snatches it up with\r\nan exclamation of joy--showing it to_ SUE.] See! Now will you believe\r\nme! [_She examines the map perplexedly._ NAT _paces up and\r\ndown--excitedly_.] I tell you it’s all true. You can’t deny it now. It’s\r\nlucky for us I forced him to confess. He might have died keeping the\r\nsecret and then we’d have lost--I’ll tell you what I’m going to do now,\r\nSue. I’m going to raise the money somewhere, somehow, and fit out\r\nanother schooner and this time I’ll sail on her myself. No trusting to\r\nDanny or anyone else! Yes, Sue, we’ll come into our own yet, even if the\r\nSarah Allen is lost---- [_He stops--then in accents of bewildered\r\nfear._] But--she can’t be lost--I saw the lights, Sue--red and\r\ngreen--as plain as I see you now---- [_He goes to one of the portholes\r\nagain._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Who has been watching him worriedly, puts the map back on the\r\ntable, gets up and, assuming a brisk, matter-of-fact tone, she goes over\r\nand takes him by the arm._] Come downstairs, Nat. Don’t think any more\r\nabout it tonight. It’s late and you’re worn out. You need rest and a\r\ngood sleep.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Following her toward the door--confusedly._] But Sue--I saw\r\nthem---- [_From above in the night comes the muffled hail in_ BARTLETT’S\r\n_voice_.] Sarah Allen, ahoy! [NAT _stops, tortured, his hands\r\ninstinctively raised up to cover his ears_. SUE _gives a startled cry.\r\nThe door above is slammed and_ BARTLETT _comes down the stairs, his face\r\nrevealing that the delusion has again full possession of his mind_.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Pointing his finger at his son and fixing him with his\r\neyes--in ringing, triumphant tones._] The Sarah Allen, boy--in the\r\nharbor below--a red and a green plain afore my eyes! What did I tell ye,\r\nboy? Come back from the Southern Seas as I swore she must! Loaded with\r\ngold as I swore she would be! [NAT _again seems to crumble--to give way\r\nto the stronger will. He takes a step toward his father, his eyes\r\nlighting up._ SUE _looks at his face--then rushes to her father_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Putting her hands to her father’s head and forcing him to look\r\ndown into her face--intensely._] Pa! Stop, do you hear me! It’s all mad!\r\nYou’re driving Nat mad, too! [_As she sees her father hesitate, the wild\r\nlight dying out of his eyes, she summons all her power to a fierce\r\npleading._] For my sake, Pa! For Ma’s sake! Think of how she would feel\r\nif she were alive and saw you acting this way with Nat! Tell him! Tell\r\nhim now--before me--tell him it’s all a lie!\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Trying in an agony of conflict to get hold of his\r\nreason--incoherently._] Yes, Sue--I hear ye--confess--aye, Sarah, your\r\ndyin’ words--keep Nat clear o’ this--but--red and green--I seen ’em\r\nplain---- [_Then suddenly after a tremendous struggle, lifting his\r\ntortured face to_ NAT’S--_in tones of despair_.] Nothin’ there, boy!\r\nDon’t ye believe! No red and green! She’ll never come! Derelict and\r\nlost, boy, the Sarah Allen. [_After another struggle with himself._] And\r\nI lied to ye, boy. I gave the word--in my mind--to kill them two. I\r\nmurdered ’em in cold blood.\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Shrinking from him in horror._] Pa! You don’t know what you’re\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--The truth, girl. Ye said--confess----\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Bewilderedly._] But--it was right. They were trying to steal----\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Overcome by the old obsession for a moment--savagely._]\r\nAye, that’s it! The thievin’ scum! They was tryin’---- [_He stays short,\r\nthrowing his head back, his whole body tense and quivering with the\r\neffort he makes to force this sustaining lie out of his brain--then,\r\nbroken but self-conquering, he looks again at_ NAT--_gently_.] No, Nat.\r\nThat be the lie I been tellin’ myself ever since. That cook--he said\r\n’twas brass---- But I’d been lookin’ for ambergris--gold--the whole o’\r\nmy life--and when we found that chest--I _had_ to believe, I tell ye!\r\nI’d been dreamin’ o’ it all my days! But he said brass and junk, and\r\ntold the boy--and I give the word to murder ’em both and cover ’em up\r\nwith sand.\r\n\r\nNAT--[_Very pale--despairingly._] But he lied, didn’t he? It is\r\ngold--real gold--isn’t it?\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Slowly takes the studded anklet from his pocket and holds it\r\nout to_ NAT. _The latter brings it to the light of the lantern._\r\nBARTLETT _sits on a chair, covering his face with his hands--in a tone\r\nof terrible suffering_.] Ye’ll tell me, boy--if it’s gold or no. I’ve\r\nhad it by me all this time--but I’ve been afeerd to show----\r\n\r\nNAT--[_In a tone of wild scorn._] Why, it’s brass, of course! The\r\ncheapest kind of junk--not worth a damn! [_He flings it savagely into a\r\ncorner of the room._ BARTLETT _groans and seems to shrink up and turn\r\ninto a figure of pitiable feebleness_.]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Pityingly._] Don’t, Nat. [_She puts her arms around her father’s\r\nshoulders protectingly._]\r\n\r\nNAT--[_In a stifled voice._] What a damned fool I’ve been! [_He flings\r\nhimself down on the cot, his shoulders heaving._]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT--[_Uncovers his grey face on which there is now settling an\r\nexpression of strange peace--stroking his daughter’s hand._] Sue--don’t\r\nthink hard o’ me. [_He takes the map._] An end to this! [_He slowly\r\ntears it into small pieces, seeming to grow weaker and weaker as he does\r\nso. Finally as he lets the fragments filter through his fingers, his\r\nwhole frame suddenly relaxes. He sighs, his eyes shut, and sags back in\r\nhis chair, his head bent forward limply on his chest._]\r\n\r\nSUE--[_Alarmed._] Pa! [_She sinks to her knees beside him and looks up\r\ninto his face._] Pa! Speak to me! It’s Sue! [_Then turning toward her\r\nbrother--terrifiedly._] Nat! Run--get the doctor---- [NAT _starts to a\r\nsitting position_. SUE _tries with trembling hands to feel of her\r\nfather’s pulse, his heart--then begins to sob hysterically_.] Oh,\r\nNat--he’s dead, I think--he’s dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Curtain Falls_]",
