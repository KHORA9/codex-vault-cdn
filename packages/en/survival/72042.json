Diagrams and Detailed Plans of Buildings, etc.                 199\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Method, and the style of the buildings, evolved and worked out\r\non The Corning Egg Farm, when put into book form proved so helpful\r\nto so vast a number of poultry keepers, that the sale of this first\r\nliterature, which for a time was added to as the months went by,\r\nreached the enormous total of over 140,000 copies in eighteen months.\r\n\r\nThe writings were the simple, plain statements of facts, and enabled\r\nothers who followed them to reach a success which, until this System\r\nwas used, may have been dreamed of, but was never realized.\r\n\r\nThe literature from this Farm has gone out over the entire civilized\r\nWorld, and the visitors, who arrive in ever increasing numbers from\r\nmonth to month, come from every quarter of the Globe.\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm has been written of in periodicals of every\r\nnature, and in almost every language the World over. For the last\r\ntwelve months the requests for further, and more explicit, detailed\r\ninformation relative to breeding and feeding for eggs, the specialty\r\nfrom which The Corning Egg Farm has never swerved, have become a\r\ndemand. So that, after mature deliberation, it was decided to write the\r\nhistory of The Corning Egg Farm, from its inception to date, including\r\nthe work of the last two years, which has never before been fully\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n“The Corning Egg Farm Book by Corning Himself” is to-day the only\r\npublication giving facts in regard to the Farm and its unique Method\r\nright up to date.\r\n\r\nAs the book is read it must be borne in mind that, in breeding to\r\nproduce a great layer, at first very marked increases in the number of\r\neggs during the first ten months of laying may be gained. The general\r\naverage number of eggs laid each year, from official reports, is less\r\nthan 100 per hen. On The Corning Egg Farm, when the average had reached\r\n143.25 eggs, the next jump, in the following year, was more than had\r\nbeen expected, and the record of 145.11 eggs for each hen for ten\r\nmonths, though showing an increase apparently small, in reality was a\r\nvery great advance indeed.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, the gain, although representing a narrower margin of\r\nincrease, was in reality a much greater achievement. The trotting horse\r\nmay serve as an illustration. When Dexter trotted his famous mile he\r\nclipped off a number of seconds from the previous record, and it seemed\r\nas if it would be a matter of considerable time before his mark would\r\nbe lowered. But within a comparatively short time a number of trotters\r\nturned off a mile in two-ten, and from this figure, within a short\r\nperiod, a large company of famous horses had reached the two-five\r\nmark, but every quarter of a second which reduced this mark meant\r\ngreater achievement in breeding than was represented by the reduction\r\nof records from two-sixteen to two-five, and we have not yet seen the\r\nhorse which, in single harness, without a running mate, can turn the\r\nmile track in two minutes flat.\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm realizes that from this on improvement will be\r\nshown by fractional figures, but these fractions will represent a\r\ngreater progress than the figures which have gone before.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago the unequaled results of The Corning Egg Farm had seemed\r\nunsurpassable, but to-day we are able to look back from higher ground\r\nand see the road over which we have traveled to reach a point very\r\nconsiderably beyond the unequaled position of two years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is our hope and aim, year by year, to improve the present position.\r\nThe man who believes he has learned all there is to learn is a failure.\r\nThe successful man is the one who is sure there is an opportunity to\r\nadvance considerably beyond the point he has already attained, and The\r\nCorning Egg Farm believes this to be true, and has constantly worked\r\nwith that idea before it.\r\n\r\nWith an experience back of them of nearly six years the Builders of The\r\nCorning Egg Farm know that this Book furnishes the necessary guide for\r\nsuccess in poultry culture. What has been, and what is being, done\r\nat The Corning Egg Farm is not experimental work. Successful results\r\nfollow the Method and System employed as surely as day follows night.\r\nIt is no longer necessary for the novice to try out the various plans\r\nproposed to him by the literary poultryman, whose methods are worked\r\nout on a mahogany desk, with pen and ink, or more often, perhaps, by\r\ndictation to a stenographer.\r\n\r\nYears of careful thought and study, and the expenditure of much time\r\nand many thousands of dollars in developing the Corning Method have\r\neliminated all necessity for experimental expenditure. The building\r\nup of an Egg Farm is within the reach of any man who will follow the\r\nCorning plan herein described faithfully and persistently.\r\n\r\nThe man or woman who determines to pursue some branch of the poultry\r\nindustry must first decide what particular branch.\r\n\r\nShall it be to raise poultry for market?\r\n\r\nIf so, what? Squab Broilers? Soft Roasters? Or Capons?\r\n\r\nPerhaps all of these.\r\n\r\nSome utility line is the best to start with.\r\n\r\nFresh, sanitary eggs are a necessity and command the highest price in\r\nthe market, daily, for spot cash, just as readily as stocks and bonds\r\ncommand a daily cash value in any financial market. There can be no\r\nbetter proof of the truth of this than the success of The Corning Egg\r\nFarm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PULLET RANGE & COLONY HOUSES\r\n\r\n  EACH HOUSE 6′ × 10′ BUILT ON SKIDS MOVABLE]\r\n\r\nIn whatever line a beginner decides to start he needs to go straight\r\ndown that line without deviation, taking as his motto, “This one thing\r\nI do.” In the fullness of time, having established a reputation for the\r\nquality of his eggs and birds, the demand for his eggs for hatching\r\npurposes and for his birds as foundation stock for other people, will\r\nnaturally come to him, and it is very profitable.\r\n\r\nOne certain fact should be settled in the understanding of every\r\nbeginner, to wit: it is not possible to invest from five hundred to\r\nfive thousand dollars in the Poultry Industry and double your money\r\nin the first year, or even to earn 50% on the investment. Neither is\r\nit possible with $300.00 to build a Laying House with a capacity for\r\nfive hundred birds, if the house is properly built for warmth and meets\r\nsanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nHousing for hens must be free from dampness. Concrete absorbs dampness,\r\ntherefore, avoid it.\r\n\r\nAny person starting in the poultry industry for profit, and, intending\r\nto follow it for a livelihood should begin in a small way, realizing\r\nthat, like any other business venture, it must be built up and grow\r\nfrom year to year, and that, certainly for the first year, no money can\r\nbe drawn out for living expenses.\r\n\r\nThese statements are made clearly and emphatically because quite the\r\ncontrary has been given out as a fact. Such reckless representations,\r\nbecause untrue, are misleading and injurious to both those engaged in\r\nthe poultry industry and also to those who contemplate entering it, and\r\nshould be branded as false, and the authors of such statements should\r\nbe prohibited from using the United States Mails.\r\n\r\nWe are not, and make no pretense of being, philanthropists. We have\r\nwritten this Book primarily with the expectation that it will make\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm and the Corning Method of Poultry Culture even\r\nmore widely and impressively known to the World, and so benefit us by\r\nincreased demand for our stock, eggs, and all other goods we may have\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we know that the Book will benefit others if they will follow\r\nthe Corning Method and System herein laid down, and so prove of mutual\r\nadvantage to readers and authors as well.\r\n\r\nThe Single Comb White Leghorn is par excellence _the_ Egg Machine,\r\nprovided always first class and the best strain of birds is procured,\r\nand the Corning Strain, without doubt or question, is the very best\r\nstrain of Single Comb White Leghorns yet developed anywhere in the\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nWe know this new, large, complete and thoroughly up to date Book will\r\nbe the means of bringing us, and our unequaled Strain of Single Comb\r\nWhite Leghorns, into favor with thousands of people who, as yet, do not\r\nknow us, just as the publishing of the small and older booklet put us\r\ninto touch with other thousands who are now doing a prosperous business\r\nby the use of this same Corning Strain Single Comb White Leghorns, and\r\nby following the Corning Method now more completely elaborated and\r\nexplained in “The Corning Egg Farm Book by Corning Himself.”\r\n\r\n  EDWARD AND GARDNER CORNING.\r\n\r\n  The Corning Egg Farm,\r\n  Bound Brook, New Jersey.\r\n\r\n  December, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm Book\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe Building of the Corning Egg Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined, in 1905, to engage in some business connected with\r\nthe feathered tribe, we decided to try out the squab proposition versus\r\nmarket poultry. After searching over a period of many months, in\r\nvarious parts of the country, with the idea of finding a place where\r\nthe existing buildings might be utilized for our needs, we finally were\r\nobliged to abandon this idea and purchased, early in the year 1906,\r\ntwelve and a half acres of land, now known as Sunny Slope Farm. This\r\nproperty lies about two miles west of Bound Brook, New Jersey, which\r\ntown is reached by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Baltimore\r\n& Ohio, the Philadelphia & Reading and the Lehigh Valley Railroads,\r\nand the Farm is most accessible, as it is on the trolley line which\r\nconnects Bound Brook and Somerville.\r\n\r\nIn the early Spring of 1906 we began our buildings, erecting a house,\r\nfor raising squabs, which would accommodate five hundred pairs of\r\nbreeding birds, a hen house of the scratching shed variety, capable\r\nof accommodating some two hundred and fifty hens, and a work-shop with\r\nliving apartments for the resident man.\r\n\r\nWe also sunk a well one hundred and seventeen feet deep, erecting over\r\nit a sixty foot wind-mill tower, which carries an eighteen hundred\r\ngallon tank. From this pipes were laid to convenient parts of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThree hundred pairs of Homer pigeons were placed in the house built for\r\nthat purpose, and we went diligently to work to prove that this was\r\nthe quick and easy way to wealth which the ingenious writers of squab\r\nliterature proved so conclusively on paper.\r\n\r\nOn the chicken side of the experiment we seemed to lean (possibly\r\nbecause of the fact that squabs take one into the slaughter house\r\nbusiness) towards one or more of the market breeds, and, to meet the\r\nneeds of this part of the business, we understood that any of the\r\n“Rock” family were best for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarted with 60 Buff Rock Eggs\r\n\r\nWe purchased an incubator with the capacity of sixty eggs, being\r\nfearful of attempting the operation of a larger machine, because, like\r\na great many novices, we had the feeling that an incubator was a very\r\ndangerous thing, and that anyone without a vast amount of experience\r\nshould not attempt to handle it. We placed in this diminutive machine\r\nsixty Buff Rock eggs, and obtained a very fair hatch. With daily\r\ncontact our fear of the machine decreased, and we exchanged it for one\r\nwith a capacity of one hundred and twenty-five eggs, and this, in turn,\r\nwas exchanged for one holding two hundred and fifty eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR STERILE LAYING HOUSE NO. 3 IN 1910]\r\n\r\nWe obtained fairly large flocks of youngsters that season, but, as we\r\nhad the usual hallucination that poultry culture was really a miracle,\r\nand required neither work, capital, nor brains, that all you had to do\r\nwas to accept the profit and the chickens did it all themselves, we\r\ndid not get so very far. The growth of the birds was so slow they did\r\nnot reach a profitable weight until the broiler market had dropped the\r\nprice to its lowest level. The pullets which we carried through the\r\nwinter never produced an egg, for the simple reason that we had never\r\nstudied the question out as to how the hen produces an egg. In other\r\nwords, our lack of knowledge of the right methods was the reason for\r\ncharging up a considerable loss instead of profit so far as the first\r\nseason’s work with hens went.\r\n\r\nWe very early discovered there must have been a considerable amount of\r\nfiction in the writings on the squab industry. One reads that a pair\r\nof pigeons eats nothing like the amount of food which is required for\r\none hen, and that they never eat more than their exact wants require,\r\nand that when they have young in the nest, this amount is very slightly\r\nincreased. We found, however, that they ate in season and out of\r\nseason. In fact one recalls, in this connection, and with considerable\r\namusement, the song, in the light opera “Wang,” of the elephant who ate\r\nall day and the elephant who ate all night.\r\n\r\nDuring our work with pigeons we tried out a number of different\r\nvarieties: Homers, Dragoons, Runt Dragoon crosses, Homer Runt crosses,\r\nMaltese Hens, and the various crosses with Runt Dragoons; also\r\nCarneaux. We were led to buy these fancy breeds through the stories of\r\nextreme prices paid for large squabs, and we bred some heavy weights\r\nonly to find, from the commission man who made a specialty of these\r\nbirds, that it was impossible to pay the price which such birds were\r\nreally worth, as trade for this class was extremely limited.\r\n\r\nVery early in our experience we realized that the poultry side of our\r\nexperiment was very much more to our liking and offered so much greater\r\nand more profitable outlook for our energies that we rang down the\r\ncurtain on Squab raising--and turned our attention exclusively to the\r\nHen.\r\n\r\nWhile our minds were still running in the line of poultry for market\r\npurposes we tried out the Black Orpingtons, the idea being that, on\r\naccount of their size, they would make ideal roasting fowls. We found,\r\nhowever, that they were a very much inbred variety, and it was almost\r\nimpossible to hatch the eggs. Out of one hundred eggs, for which we\r\npaid twenty dollars, eight chicks hatched, and these were not of\r\nsufficient vitality to live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE FARM IN 1909]\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Money in Eggs\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, however, we were studying the poultry question,\r\nand had arrived at the conclusion that there was more money in eggs,\r\nproperly produced and marketed, than in any other branch. One of the\r\ndifficulties we met with in our investigations was the fact that so\r\nmany different writers had such a variety of ideas on the same subject,\r\nand practically no two of them agreed on any given part of poultry\r\nculture. What seemed to us even more confusing was that, in most cases,\r\nthe writer summed up his article by contradicting everything he had\r\nsaid in the previous chapters. We were finally forced to the conclusion\r\nthat the raising of poultry had not yet been reduced to a science,\r\nbut was almost entirely made up of guesses. In our investigations,\r\nhowever, we found in the writings of the late Prof. Gowell, of Maine,\r\nan entirely different condition. He was the first man, so far as our\r\nobservations went, who worked on the principle that effect followed\r\ncause, in poultry as in everything else. We studied his bulletins with\r\ngreat interest, and decided we would endeavor to prove that the same\r\nresults gotten by him could be duplicated by others.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdopted White Leghorns\r\n\r\nWe had also been studying the condition of the egg market, so far as\r\nNew York and vicinity was concerned, and had found that this market\r\npaid a premium for a white shelled egg. This, then, was the determining\r\nfactor in the selection of the breed of fowls, and after gathering all\r\nthe information we could regarding birds which laid white eggs, we were\r\nsatisfied, taking everything into consideration, that for an Egg Farm,\r\nthe Single Comb White Leghorn, was the only fowl.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1907 we collected a breeding pen, from different\r\nsources, of thirty Single Comb White Leghorn yearling hens, and three\r\nstrong, vigorous cockerels. We purchased an incubator holding three\r\nhundred and ninety eggs, and three out-door brooders, and built a\r\nnumber of small Colony Houses to move the birds into as soon as they\r\nwere large enough to be transferred from the brooders. The hens chosen\r\nfor the initial breeding pen of the Farm were most carefully selected,\r\nfor even then we had in mind the result which we intended to reach,\r\nas to the ultimate type of layer on the Farm. We placed the resulting\r\neggs from this breeding pen in the incubator, using a primitive turning\r\nmachine to keep them in proper condition until the requisite number was\r\nacquired to fill the incubator. Our hatch was a very good one, and we\r\nsucceeded in raising a fair number of the youngsters hatched.\r\n\r\nDuring the Summer we erected what is now known on the Farm as the No.\r\n1 Laying House. This was built one hundred feet long, by twelve feet\r\nwide, and on the same twenty foot section construction which has\r\nproved to be so successful a plan for poultry houses. The one mistake\r\nin this house was its width, and that has now been remedied by widening\r\nit to the standard, sixteen feet in width, and sixty feet in length\r\nhave been added to it.\r\n\r\nThe youngsters on range grew rapidly. We marketed the cockerels at\r\nbetween eight and ten weeks of age, and they weighed from one and a\r\nquarter pounds to a pound and three quarters. These were sold “on the\r\nhoof,” as we had decided for the future to do nothing in the slaughter\r\nhouse line, and to this decision we have strictly adhered, shipping\r\nalive also all culls and birds of any age showing imperfections, the\r\nmajority of our stock finding ready market for breeding purposes when\r\nwe are ready to dispose of it.\r\n\r\nAs a correct record of the mortality of our hatching, and the number of\r\ncockerels marketed, had been kept, we found that we should have in the\r\nColony Houses about two hundred and twenty-five pullets to place in No.\r\n1 House.\r\n\r\nIn catching up the birds we found that the number figured on was about\r\nright. These two hundred and twenty-five birds went into the House,\r\nOctober 31st. They were already laying on the Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Use of Roosting Closets\r\n\r\nIt was a very interesting sight to us to watch these birds at work\r\nin the first house which had ever been successfully built without\r\npartitions, in other words, one large flock with the run of the entire\r\nhouse. Others had tried it, and had failed. They had had draughts, and\r\nhad found the house, therefore, very undesirable. We conceived the idea\r\nof roosting closets, with a partition extending some little distance\r\nbeyond the dropping boards, running from the ceiling to the floor, thus\r\nbreaking the house up so far as extended circulation of air went, and\r\nat the same time giving the birds the benefit of the larger area.\r\n\r\nIt was also a matter of great interest to two novices to watch the egg\r\noutput in this first house. On the first day of November five eggs were\r\ngathered; on the second, seven; the third saw a drop to four. Of course\r\nthese pullets had been giving us more eggs than this on the Range, but\r\na transfer from one place to another always means a set-back to a layer.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the month saw the hens producing above seventeen eggs a\r\nday. December was started with an output of forty, and from that the\r\nbirds ran into larger numbers daily until the last of December, when,\r\nwith the mercury registering well down around zero, they were turning\r\nout one hundred eggs a day. The increase in the egg output continued\r\nsteadily, and we found that March was the record month, but the highest\r\nsingle day was in April, when the pen produced one hundred and seventy\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AS YOU APPROACH THE CORNING EGG FARM FROM THE PUBLIC\r\nHIGHWAY, IN 1911\r\n\r\nShowing 264-Foot Brooder House, Breeding Cockerel House and Office]\r\n\r\nWe were well satisfied with the result of the Winter’s work with these\r\npullets, and, although we did not have the knowledge that has since\r\ncome to us in feeding for eggs, the output was a most creditable one,\r\nand we found a ready market at a good price.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Fall we had mapped out our plans for a very decided\r\nincrease in plant for the coming season. The excavation for the\r\nIncubator Cellar, sixteen by fifty feet, had been made, and the Brooder\r\nHouse above it was enclosed without difficulty before weather of any\r\ngreat severity overtook us. We were blessed with a very late Fall, and\r\nmild weather continued, with only occasional dips, well into December,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nWe installed in the Cellar ten incubators, with a capacity of three\r\nhundred and ninety eggs each. The Brooder House, with its arrangement\r\nfor Hovers and Nursery pens, was all completed, and the month of March\r\nfound us placing eggs in the machines.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1907 we had enlarged our Breeding House, so that we\r\nwere able to place in it some two hundred and fifty breeders. Out of\r\nour original pen of thirty, we had lost two. From different sources we\r\nbought yearling hens, and with our original twenty-eight, made up the\r\nbreeding pen.\r\n\r\nOf course, as we had planned to endeavor to produce some three thousand\r\npullets for the Fall of 1908, we were obliged to very materially\r\nsupplement the product of our own breeders, with eggs from other\r\nsources, and this we did, buying eggs from different breeders, in\r\nwidely separated territories.\r\n\r\nAs the hatching season advanced we added one more incubator to our\r\nbattery of ten, and we placed in these incubators a total of eleven\r\nthousand eight hundred and four eggs, of which two thousand and\r\nninety-six showed dead germs and clear eggs on the fourteenth day test.\r\n\r\nThe resulting number of chicks placed in the Brooder House was five\r\nthousand eight hundred and sixty-six for the entire season.\r\n\r\nWe found that the eggs purchased did not produce anything like the\r\nnumber of chicks, that is, strong, livable chicks, that did the eggs\r\ncoming from our own breeding pen, which proved to us that the method of\r\nfeeding and caring for breeding stock, pursued by others, fell very far\r\nshort of the results gotten by our own methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Count Only Livable Chicks\r\n\r\nThe lesson of incubation, which it is so difficult to make people\r\nunderstand, is not so much a question of how many chicks may be hatched\r\nfrom a given number of eggs as of how many strong, livable chicks are\r\nbrought out. We very early in our hatching experience decided to count\r\nonly those chicks, which were strong, and apparently capable of a\r\nsteady growth and a sturdy maturity. Thus, the count of the number of\r\nchicks produced, does not really show the number which came out of the\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFICE BUILDING]\r\n\r\nWe were extremely fortunate in handling the youngsters in the Brooder\r\nHouse, and our mortality was very low, and when the youngsters were\r\nplaced in the Colony Houses, which had been built during the early\r\nSpring months, and placed out on the Range in readiness for them, they\r\nwere a sturdy, vigorous crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nPercentage of Cockerels Low\r\n\r\nThe number of cockerels was very low, and these, as rapidly as they\r\ndeveloped, were taken away from the pullets and placed in a fattening\r\npen which had been provided, and as our stock was still an “unknown\r\nquantity” in Poultrydom, we marketed the larger part of them at broiler\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe pullets came on finely, and the records show that a large number of\r\nthem came into eggs when they were a few days over four months of age.\r\n\r\nThrough the connivance of an employé we made a heavy loss in the way of\r\ntheft, and, when the final round-up of the pullets came, we found we\r\nhad one thousand nine hundred and fifty-three.\r\n\r\nDuring the Summer, we had built the No. 2 Laying House, sixteen feet\r\nwide by one hundred and sixty feet long, and in this house the first\r\nfifteen hundred pullets were installed, the balance going into No. 1\r\nLaying House.\r\n\r\nA number of visitors had called at the Farm during the Summer of 1908,\r\nand we had listened to the different stories of the ease with which\r\nfive thousand laying pullets were produced annually, but at the end of\r\nthis season we had much more respect for the number five thousand than\r\nwe ever had before, and realized very fully what it meant to produce\r\nthat number of females each year.\r\n\r\nWith the placing of these fifteen hundred pullets in this House of one\r\nhundred and sixty feet in length by sixteen feet wide, without being\r\ndivided into separate pens, each hen having the entire run of the House\r\nand no more (that is, she did not leave the house for a yard, but\r\nstayed right in that space and did her work), we accomplished what,\r\nfrom the standpoint of all authorities on the subject of Poultry, was\r\nan impossible thing to do, and have the hen produce anything. And yet\r\neach hen had only two and one third square feet of floor space, which\r\nincluded the dropping boards.\r\n\r\nThe secret of being able to work the hen successfully in such a limited\r\nspace per bird is in the length of the house. In reality, every bird\r\nhas one hundred and sixty feet by sixteen feet in which to exercise and\r\nroam.\r\n\r\nThe four hundred and fifty-three pullets which were placed in No. 1\r\nLaying House were given the entire run of this house, of one hundred\r\nfeet by twelve feet, and yet the Egg Record for the ten months, in\r\nwhich these birds never left either house, is rather in favor of the\r\nhouse containing the fifteen hundred pullets. The average number of\r\neggs per pullet in these houses, from December 1st, 1908, to September\r\n30th, 1909, was 143.25. Many people who had seen the No. 2 House filled\r\nwith the fifteen hundred pullets could hardly believe what they saw.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Flock System Succeeds\r\n\r\nThe extreme health and great vigor of the birds was evident to anyone\r\nwho looked in through the wire doors. Articles were written in numerous\r\npapers stating that the thing was impossible, and that, before many\r\nmonths, absolute failure would result. But in spite of all the\r\nprophecies the great flock system, in the Corning style House, proved\r\nby its great success, that a decided forward step had been made in\r\neconomical management and housing of poultry.\r\n\r\nWe had gone ahead handling poultry in just the same way that any\r\nbusiness would be handled, plus the scientific study of the anatomy\r\nof the hen, and what it was necessary to breed in order to accomplish\r\na great success as a producer of large, white, uniform eggs, with the\r\nability added to that formula, of turning them out in large quantities.\r\n\r\nCallers at the Farm brought very forcibly home to us the fact, then\r\nquite unappreciated by us, that the methods employed, and the results\r\nobtained, were very remarkable from the standpoint of anything done\r\nin Poultry Culture up to that time. It was pointed out that in almost\r\nevery other case it was not known by the poultryman just where he stood\r\nat any time of the year, let alone being able to tell where he stood\r\nevery day of the year. The success of The Corning Egg Farm really has\r\nthat feature as its foundation stone.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the ten months of laying of the 1953 pullets we had\r\nreceived a number of overtures to put our methods and results into a\r\nbook, and, after a time, such a book was written. The tremendous sale\r\nand success of that book is now a matter of history, and the great\r\nnumber of people who were helped to better things in poultry, and the\r\nstill greater number of novices who were started on the road, were\r\nenabled, through this book, to reach a success which, as many of them\r\ntestify, would have been impossible without it. In eighteen months over\r\none hundred and forty thousand copies of this first book were sold.\r\nHundreds of people came to the Farm to find out for themselves whether\r\nor not the statements in the book were true, and these people found\r\neverything, down to the smallest detail, just exactly as represented.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeigners Visit the Farm\r\n\r\nThe Visitors’ Register, which is kept at the Farm, shows callers\r\nfrom almost every nook and corner of the Globe. In Scotland, a short\r\ndistance from Glasgow, there is now almost a perfect duplicate of Sunny\r\nSlope Farm. The owner, who has twice crossed the ocean and come to the\r\nFarm, states that if you were blindfolded and taken from Glasgow the\r\nthree miles out to his property it would be quite impossible for you to\r\ntell whether you were in New Jersey or Scotland, so absolutely alike\r\nare the buildings in every detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREEDING COCKERELS, FALL OF 1909]\r\n\r\nIn England, a short distance from Tunbridge, the Corning Laying House\r\nis again found. At this Farm both White and Black Leghorns are carried,\r\nand the owners write that they are meeting with great success in\r\nfollowing the Corning Method.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigated for Germany\r\n\r\nGermany sent a man who spent twelve months investigating the different\r\nmethods of poultry raising and housing, and he visited all the plants\r\nof any note whatever from the Atlantic to the Pacific, including\r\nCanada, down to the Gulf of Mexico. He did not make his mission known,\r\nand it was only after his return to his native country that his\r\nidentity was disclosed. His report is of more than passing interest to\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm, as it states that the Method and System envolved\r\non The Corning Egg Farm surpasses anything that has as yet come under\r\nhis observation. The investigator is not only conversant with what he\r\nsaw in the line of poultry breeding during his twelve months’ sojourn\r\nin America, but he is thoroughly posted in regard to everything in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe pullets were hardly placed in the Nos. 1 and 2 Laying Houses, in\r\nthe Fall of 1908, before we began to plan for the Spring of 1909. We\r\nhad enlarged the Breeding House again, so that we now had housed some\r\nfour hundred and seventy-five yearling and two year old hens. These\r\nwere made up from our breeding pen of the year before, and as many of\r\nour two hundred and twenty-five pullets as qualified. We bought a few\r\nother yearling hens from different sources, and likewise the necessary\r\ncomplement of cockerels.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection of Cockerels\r\n\r\nWe gave great care to the selection of the males heading the breeding\r\npen, every bird having perfect head points, being strong and vigorous,\r\nand as large as we could find him, where we felt sure that no outside\r\nblood had been introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Brooder House during the Fall, was materially added to, giving\r\nus twenty Hover Pens, three feet wide, and twelve Nursery Pens, each\r\nnearly five feet wide, this giving us a Brooder House 118 feet long by\r\n16 feet wide.\r\n\r\nWe again this year (1909) supplemented our own breeding pen with\r\npurchases of eggs from different sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nPullets Lay in 129 Days\r\n\r\nOur hatches this Spring were very successful, and the chicks which went\r\nup into the Brooder House were strong and vigorous. The mortality was\r\nlow, and when placed on Range they grew rapidly. The pullets came into\r\neggs, as they had in the two previous years, within a few days after\r\nthey passed the four months’ mile-stone.\r\n\r\nWe had added some six Colony Houses to our range equipment. The\r\nbuilding originally designed for pigeons we planned to change over into\r\na Breeding House, for, in the Fall of 1909, we would have a sufficient\r\nnumber of yearling hens to carry quite a breeding establishment. This\r\nhouse was about completed in the month of May, when it mysteriously\r\ntook fire, and was a complete loss. Fortunately the fire broke out at\r\nabout ten o’clock in the morning, and, by the timely assistance of\r\nthe boys of the Wilson Military Academy, under the able direction of\r\nthe Military Officers of that Academy, we were able to confine it to\r\nthis one building in spite of the fact that a high wind was blowing,\r\nwhich carried the sparks directly on to the other buildings. The water\r\nsupply on the Farm proved more than adequate to the necessities of the\r\noccasion, and the loss was entirely covered by insurance.\r\n\r\nAs we desired to recognize the services of the young men, and at\r\nthe suggestion of the Commanding Officer, medals were struck off\r\ncommemorative of the fire and of the bravery displayed by these young\r\nmen at this time, and were presented to them.\r\n\r\nAn addition to the Breeding House, extending over the site of the\r\nburned building, was immediately erected, and the small building which\r\nhad been used as a fattening pen for cockerels was rebuilt, and became\r\nthe breeding pen for the production of unrelated cockerels.\r\n\r\nAlso during this season the No. 3 Laying House was built, this being an\r\nexact duplicate of the No. 2 House.\r\n\r\nOur selection of Breeders for 1910 was of course made from the birds\r\nwhich had completed their first ten months of pullet laying, in the\r\nhouses Nos. 1 and 2. The mortality during these months had been about\r\n7 per cent. With our method of selection only 950 of these birds\r\nqualified to be used as yearling breeders, and these were placed in the\r\nBreeding House which had been prepared for them. We had made a most\r\ncareful selection of cockerels, and these we had reared in two Colony\r\nHouses, placed in a large yard, where we were planning to eventually\r\nerect a Cockerel House for the housing of cockerels specially selected\r\nfor breeders.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the birds from Nos. 1 and 2, together with our breeders\r\nof 1909, were sold, and we were able to face the hatching season of\r\n1910 with a very decided step forward towards the realization of the\r\nideal yearling breeder, which The Corning Egg Farm is working nearer to\r\neach season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR LAYING HOUSE NO. 2 IN 1910]\r\n\r\nWe placed in the Laying Houses Nos. 2 and 3 about 2750 pullets, and our\r\nrespect for the man who could successfully, yearly, produce and raise\r\nto maturity five thousand pullets, increased materially.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping Down Labor Bill\r\n\r\nThe question of keeping down the labor bill on the Farm has at all\r\ntimes been a matter of careful study, and the machinery which is in use\r\nis of large capacity, enabling us to turn out whatever may be required\r\nin a very short space of time, and allowing the men to get at other\r\nwork. As an illustration; the Clover Cutter on the Farm has a capacity\r\nof 3000 pounds an hour, cut in one-fourth-inch lengths, which enables\r\nus, when we are cutting green food, to turn out the amount required for\r\nthe day, fill the tubs, and have it on the way to the Laying Houses, in\r\nless than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThe question of economy in time in handling the Incubator Cellar had\r\nbeen a problem, which we finally solved by piping gas into the Cellar\r\nand Brooder House, from the mains which are laid in the road passing\r\nthe Farm. Thus we did away with the danger of fire from sixteen\r\nincubator lamps (for we now had in the cellar sixteen machines) and\r\nthe twenty Hover lamps, and the time and labor of cleaning and filling\r\nthem. We placed a governor on the gas main, so that it was impossible\r\nto increase the pressure at any time of the day or night, and the gas\r\nworked most satisfactorily in incubation and brooding.\r\n\r\nThe extensions on the Farm planned for 1910 were a Cockerel House, for\r\nthe housing of breeding cockerels, and the widening and lengthening of\r\nNo. 1 Laying House. These alterations were made in No. 1, so that it\r\nwas an exact counterpart of Nos. 2 and 3. We also planned, as soon as\r\nthe breeding season was over, and the 1910 breeding pen was shipped to\r\nthe various buyers who had purchased these birds for August delivery\r\n(and the entire pen was sold early in 1910), to add another section to\r\nthe Breeder House, and to build a few more Colony Houses. Then we built\r\nwhat we thought would be an adequate Office to handle the business of\r\nthe Farm, but which has since proved large enough for only one quarter\r\nof the present requirements. We increased the size of the Egg Packing\r\nRoom, and installed a freezer with a capacity of over two thousand\r\npounds of green bone. This practically covers the enlargements on the\r\nplant for 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdopted Hot Water Incubators\r\n\r\nFor three years we had been investigating quietly the so-called Mammoth\r\nIncubators, or in other words, the Coal Heated, Hot Water Incubator,\r\nand before the close of the hatching season of 1911 we had decided\r\nto install two such machines in a cellar 146 feet long by 22 feet\r\nwide--this cellar to be built so as to allow us to extend the present\r\nBrooder House to the same length and width as the cellar.\r\n\r\nThis cellar has since been constructed, with a Brooder House over it,\r\nso that we now have capacity for the incubation of 15,600 eggs at one\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Water System for heating the air supplying the Hovers has also\r\nbeen installed, and the Brooder House now has a capacity of some 12,000\r\nyoungsters, before it is necessary to move any of them to the Range.\r\n\r\nThe Breeder House has again been enlarged, and, with the addition, a\r\nyear hence, of another Breeding House, which is planned to be 180 feet\r\nlong by 16 feet wide, and a larger house for the breeding of unrelated\r\ncockerels, The Corning Egg Farm will have reached the limit planned for\r\nsince the inception of the Farm. We shall then have a capacity of 4500\r\nsterile pullets, 3500 yearling hens for breeding purposes, and housing\r\nfor 1200 cockerels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Great Farms Fail\r\n\r\nOne reads of Poultry Farms carrying anywhere from twenty to forty\r\nthousand layers. Experience has taught us that the plant that gets\r\nbeyond the size where those financially interested can supervise and\r\nknow the condition of the Farm from one end to another daily, falls\r\ndown of its own weight, as it is impossible to find men, unless\r\nfinancially interested, who will look after the endless details, which\r\nspell success or ruin on a large poultry plant.\r\n\r\nThe planning and designing of all buildings on The Corning Egg Farm was\r\ndone by ourselves, and all the construction has been done under our\r\npersonal supervision. In the first two years we did not contract even\r\nthe labor, employing simply “handy men” who worked with us under our\r\ninstructions. Latterly, with the large amount of routine and office\r\nwork pressing upon us, we found it to be wise economy to contract the\r\nlabor, ourselves supplying the material and supervising the work.\r\n\r\nThe buildings, with the arrangement of all equipment, are built in\r\naccordance with ideas thought and worked out by ourselves, on lines\r\nwhich seemed to us common sense, and economical in time and money for\r\nthe handling of Poultry.\r\n\r\nUntil within the last two years we had never seen another poultry farm,\r\nand those we have seen have only strengthened our conviction that no\r\nserious error has been made in laying out The Corning Egg Farm Plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEgg Farming the Most Profitable Branch of Poultry Keeping\r\n\r\n\r\nThe profits are surer and larger. The reason this is not more widely\r\nknown is because, in the past, few people have been able to resist the\r\ntemptation of attempting to cover a number of the different branches\r\nof poultry culture. They have tried to get into the “fancy,” and\r\nhave dreamed of taking a blue ribbon at Madison Square Garden, or at\r\nsome other large Show. Then the broiler branch has engrossed their\r\nattention, and from that they have gone on to soft roasters, and\r\nthe other phases of the slaughter house side of poultry for market\r\npurposes, and they have endeavored to cover all the different branches\r\nfrom which money is made in poultry, while entirely overlooking the\r\nfact that this is an age of specialization, and that the person who\r\nwould succeed in any business must make up his mind to follow one\r\nbranch of it, and bring that branch up to the highest efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloping the Great Layer\r\n\r\nFrom the start the Builders of The Corning Egg Farm, at Bound Brook, N.\r\nJ., realized these conditions, and were never led into side issues but\r\ngave their entire thought and attention to the development of a great\r\nlayer, realizing that if this was to be accomplished everything except\r\nan egg must be considered a by-product, and disposed of along the line\r\nof least resistance: in short carrying out the Scriptural injunction,\r\n“This one thing I do.” This one thought has been so successfully\r\nadhered to that the development of The Corning Egg Farm in five years\r\nhas been remarkable in its production of the greatest laying type of\r\nhen yet produced, the Corning Strain Single Comb White Leghorn, placing\r\nthe Farm head and shoulders above any other Egg Farm anywhere in the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nEgg Farming is profitable not only when carried on in a large way, but,\r\nto the suburban dweller, a small number of hens in the back yard is a\r\nprofitable investment, and the system, as worked out on The Corning\r\nEgg Farm, succeeds with a few hens, and enables the owner of a small\r\nplot of land to always have sanitary, fresh eggs, to reduce his grocery\r\nbills, and materially increase the pleasure of suburban life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Method in Small Flocks\r\n\r\nTwo illustrations of the working out of the Corning Method in a small\r\nway would doubtless be of interest. While it is true that the 16 feet\r\nwide House is the most desirable from all standpoints, the length of\r\nthe house may be anything from 20 feet to 200 feet, as the house is of\r\nsectional construction, 20 feet being a section.\r\n\r\nIn the back yard of a gentleman living in Bound Brook was kept a small\r\npen of birds, in all eighteen, composed of hens and pullets. These were\r\na mixture of Barred Rocks and Rhode Island Reds. The pullets were of\r\nearly hatch and should have come into eggs at least in the first week\r\nof October. The hens completed the moult much earlier than is generally\r\nexpected, and still the owner was without eggs.\r\n\r\nDifferent methods, and nostrums of guaranteed egg producing foods,\r\nwere tried, but all without success. After a call at The Corning Egg\r\nFarm, he stated that in one week and three days the first eggs were\r\nfound in the nests, and the continuance of the Corning Method of\r\nfeeding and working the hens produced eggs steadily through the Winter\r\nmonths, beginning with the middle of December, and the birds continued\r\nto lay more than an average output until they went into the moult the\r\nfollowing Fall.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who has a small place within a mile of The Corning Egg\r\nFarm, some four years ago purchased hatching eggs from our Breeding\r\nPen, and the following Fall he also bought a small pen of Breeders. He\r\naims to produce and carry through the Winter about one hundred pullets,\r\nand for four years now, by adhering strictly to the Corning Method, and\r\nwith the Corning Strain Single Comb White Leghorns, he has met with a\r\nsuccess almost phenomenal.\r\n\r\nBefore he became conversant with the Corning Method (and with the stock\r\nhe was then carrying before beginning with the Corning Strain) his\r\nsuccess was represented by zero, but to-day his balance sheets, which\r\nhe displays with great pride, are extremely interesting reading.\r\n\r\nThis gives a very fair illustration of two small flocks of different\r\nsize, and of the results obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Large Farms\r\n\r\nTurning now to the story of two egg farms which have been built within\r\nthe last two years, one in New Jersey and the other in Pennsylvania, we\r\nfind again most interesting and successful conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Farm started its first season by the purchase from\r\nus of fifteen hundred hatching eggs. The owner came to our Farm and\r\nasked our assistance in planning his campaign of growth. His hatch from\r\nthe fifteen hundred eggs, and he never had run an incubator before,\r\nwas some 75 per cent. of all eggs set, and, by following the feeding\r\nmethods prescribed, his mortality was very low. He placed in his Laying\r\nHouse that Fall some five hundred pullets, and in July, 1910, he had\r\nsent us an order for three thousand eggs for the season of 1911.\r\n\r\nAs he told this story on a visit to The Corning Egg Farm, in the\r\nmonth of February, 1911, he had done the almost impossible, simply\r\nby following the Method laid down in the literature published by The\r\nCorning Egg Farm, and had made money from the second month that his\r\npullets had begun to lay. The quality of his eggs was such that he took\r\nover the trade of the largest hotel in a neighboring city, so far as he\r\nwas able to supply their wants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANORAMIC VIEW OF PART OF THE CORNING EGG FARM,\r\nPHOTOGRAPHED IN OCTOBER, 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe Jersey Egg Farm referred to is owned and run by a gentleman of\r\nadvanced years. His first season’s start was on a very small scale, but\r\nhe was most successful in bringing his pullets to the laying point, and\r\ngetting a remarkable output of eggs through the Winter months. In his\r\ndistrict he was able to dispose of all his eggs to people who came to\r\nthe door and paid the cash for them at prices ten to twenty cents per\r\ndozen above the market. The Corning Egg Farm received from him a very\r\nlarge order for hatching eggs for the season of 1911, and this Fall he\r\nhad an elegant flock of pullets ready to house and turn out an ever\r\nincreasing supply of eggs for the coming Winter.\r\n\r\nThese four illustrations are a few of the many which The Corning Egg\r\nFarm is able to point to as the result of the use of its Method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWhat is a Fresh Egg?--An Egg Should be Sanitary as Well as Fresh\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer one generally gets to this query is, an egg so many hours\r\nold, and, as the average grocer prints the card, “just laid.” “Fresh”\r\nand “new laid,” as applied to eggs, mean nothing. Hens improperly fed\r\nlay eggs not only often unpalatable, but that are carriers of disease.\r\nThe hen’s productive organs are so constructed that bacteria which she\r\nmay take into her crop with impure food are passed into the egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nManure Drainage to Drink\r\n\r\nAn egg being eighty per cent. water, consider the effect on eggs\r\nproduced by the farmers’ flocks, where the water supply is mainly pools\r\nin the barn yard, which receive the drainage from the manure piles,\r\nand where the principal food supply is scratched out of manure heaps,\r\nconsisting of undigested grain that has already passed through another\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nA hen must have a large proportion of animal food to lay well, and to\r\nproduce rich, nutritious eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseased Meat to Eat\r\n\r\nConsider what in many instances this animal food consists of, carcasses\r\nof glandered horses, tuberculous cows, and putrid and maggoty meat. If\r\na dish of putrid beef were placed on the table before people they would\r\nshrink back in horror, yet they will eat eggs which have been produced\r\nby hens which have been fed on these identical ingredients, apparently\r\nentirely oblivious of the fact that the hen performs no miracle in\r\nthe production of an egg, but simply manufactures the egg from the\r\nmaterials, whatever they may be, which she gathers into her system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Food, so the Egg\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Department of Agriculture,\r\nsays that while such conditions undoubtedly do exist it cannot be\r\nproven that such eggs are shipped from State to State, and that,\r\ntherefore, it does not come under the jurisdiction of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, and cannot be controlled under the National Pure\r\nFood Law.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed, then, is to know that eggs are not only fresh, but\r\nsanitary. The Corning Egg Farm layers are fed the best quality of\r\ngrains and meals that can be procured. The animal food is supplied\r\nby fresh, green bone, cut and prepared daily. This bone comes from\r\ninspected cattle only, and the Farm is equipped with a large freezing\r\nplant for the purpose of carrying the bone in a perfectly fresh\r\ncondition. The hens are housed and cared for under absolutely sanitary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Perfect Egg a Rarity\r\n\r\nThe growing interest in Poultry Culture is bringing the Public to a\r\nrealization of the fallacy of the old idea that “any egg not rotten\r\nmust be a good egg.” Comparatively few people have ever eaten a perfect\r\negg. With the growth of real egg farms through the country, the time is\r\napproaching when the words “fresh” or “strictly fresh” will no longer\r\nmean anything to the purchaser, and the word “sanitary” will take\r\ntheir place, and in some way the egg trade will be controlled, and the\r\ngrocer, and butcher, and peddlers of eggs, will not be allowed to put\r\ncold storage eggs out as a sanitary article of food.\r\n\r\nSome of the New York papers are now beginning to agitate the question\r\nof Sanitary Eggs, notably the _New York Commercial_, which is a leader\r\nin this educational line. The day is coming when the person who is\r\noperating an egg farm that is known to produce the egg of real quality\r\nwill have no difficulty in obtaining the price that such an article is\r\nreally worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlimited Demand for Quality Eggs\r\n\r\nThere is an unlimited demand for an egg which can be depended upon\r\nas to quality. The difficulty that the seller meets with when going\r\nto a hotel or restaurant is the fact that the proprietor has been\r\nfooled many times. As they have put it, “people start well, and for\r\na time keep up the quantity, and the quality is all right, but when\r\nthe stringent time of year comes they fall down as to quantity, and a\r\nlittle later they have evidently been tempted to keep up the quantity\r\nby gathering eggs from other sources than their own, and then we meet\r\nwith the questionable pleasure of having a patron at our tables return\r\nto us an egg just ready to hatch.”\r\n\r\nWhen one seeks private trade for the output of his hennery it is\r\npossible to obtain extreme prices, provided the buyers can be convinced\r\nof the absolutely high quality of what they are purchasing.\r\n\r\nIn New York, last year, for a few weeks, a man, gotten up as a\r\nveritable “hay-seed” farmer, sold eggs from house to house through the\r\nstreets running from 45th to 65th, in large quantities. They were all\r\nmarked in red ink with the date on which they were said to be laid.\r\n\r\nHe did not last very long, and his liberty was curtailed, and for\r\nsome time he graced one of the free institutions where iron bars\r\nobstruct the view of the surrounding country. It developed that this\r\nenterprising crook was buying the culls from cold storage houses, and,\r\nin a basement on 43d Street near the North River, he had eight girls\r\nsteadily at work marking the alleged dates when these eggs were laid.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty seems to be that when you reach the question of a\r\n“fresh egg,” everyone, almost, becomes a fakir. The grocers, many of\r\nthem, buy case after case of storage eggs, and, when the retail price\r\nreaches sixty-five cents a dozen for so called “fresh eggs,” they are\r\nsupplying all buyers with the cold storage product, in quantities\r\npractically unlimited. Their counters are always decorated with baskets\r\nof these “just laid, perfectly fresh eggs.”\r\n\r\nTherefore, it becomes necessary for the Egg Farmer to satisfy\r\ncustomers, beyond peradventure, as to his ability to himself supply\r\nthe goods which he contracts to deliver, and after once doing this his\r\nexperience will be the same as that of The Corning Egg Farm, not to\r\nbe able to keep and properly look after enough hens to turn out half\r\nthe eggs he could sell at profitable prices, because the price he asks\r\ndoes not discourage customers who are willing to pay well for a really\r\nsatisfactory article.\r\n\r\nThe following is the basis on which The Corning Egg Farm makes all its\r\ncontracts for table eggs.\r\n\r\n  SUNNY SLOPE FARM\r\n\r\n  (THE GREAT CORNING EGG FARM)\r\n\r\n  PRODUCES\r\n\r\n  EGGS FOR THE TABLE\r\n\r\n  “WHICH CANNOT BE SURPASSED”\r\n\r\n              WHITE,\r\n  ~THEY ARE~: STERILE,\r\n              SANITARY,\r\n              FRESH,\r\n\r\n  ~STERILE.~--The hens producing Eggs for the Table are housed by\r\n  themselves and their eggs do not contain the life germ, giving a\r\n  purity not otherwise obtained.\r\n\r\n  ~SANITARY~,--because of the clean, fresh air housing and best\r\n  quality of pure food and water. People are learning the necessity of\r\n  investigating the source from which Eggs come more carefully than\r\n  milk or water, as it is now known that Eggs can be a greater carrier\r\n  of disease than either milk or water.\r\n\r\n  ~FRESH~,--because eggs laid one day are delivered the next.\r\n\r\n  ~OUR METHODS~ and feeding formulas give these eggs a delicious\r\n  flavor, peculiarly their own.\r\n\r\n  ~EVERY EGG~ sold by us is produced on Sunny Slope Farm, and is\r\n  guaranteed as above stated.\r\n\r\n  ONCE BOUGHT, ALWAYS SOUGHT\r\n\r\n  SUNNY SLOPE FARM\r\n\r\n  BOUND BROOK NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPreparation of Eggs for Market\r\n\r\n\r\nIf high prices are to be obtained for eggs they must not only be good,\r\nbut have a look of “class,” to the would be purchaser. They must be\r\nspotlessly clean, and, as far as possible, each dozen should present a\r\nuniform appearance.\r\n\r\nOne is able to know each day the exact price of the class of eggs which\r\nhe is selling, for the Egg Market is like the Stock or Bond Market, and\r\none who is in the Egg business is dealing with a commodity which at all\r\ntimes is salable at a price. At The Corning Egg Farm we receive daily\r\nthe reports from the Exchange, as given in the _New York Commercial_.\r\nThese are cut out and placed in a scrap book, so that, from year to\r\nyear, we are able to tell exactly what the conditions were on any given\r\ndate, and form a very close idea as to what can be expected in regard\r\nto prices. And so we have an absolute basis of prices for contracts.\r\n\r\nThe nearest quotation to the egg which is produced by The Corning Egg\r\nFarm is what is termed “State Pa. and nearby Hennery, white, fancy,\r\nlarge.” This we take as a basis and arrange our prices from it daily,\r\nadding the advance which the Corning sanitary table egg brings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30 DOZEN CORNING SANITARY FRESH EGGS READY TO SHIP]\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible, with the growth of the country and the demand\r\nfor better things in all food products, to over-do the production of\r\nSanitary Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe following pages show the manner in which the quotations are placed\r\nin our Scrap Book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York Commercial]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York Commercial]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Selection of the Breed--The Strain is of Utmost Importance\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a man engaging in any branch of Poultry Culture the selection of the\r\nproper breed is of grave importance, but to the man who is planning an\r\nEgg Farm it is without doubt of graver importance than where any other\r\nbranch of the poultry business is to be carried on.\r\n\r\nFor many years different localities have believed that there was very\r\ndecided merit in the different colored egg shells. The Culture of\r\nBoston was certain that the dark shell contained an egg with a richer\r\nflavor, while New York and vicinity would believe in nothing but the\r\nwhite shelled egg. It is, however, noted with interest that the Culture\r\nof Boston has discovered that the color of the shell really has nothing\r\nto do with the flavor of the egg, and to-day the rigid adherence to a\r\npremium paid for the dark shelled egg, generally throughout the New\r\nEngland States, is rapidly passing into history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRAIN THAT MAKES THE CORNING EGG FARM FAMOUS]\r\n\r\nAs The Corning Egg Farm was located within a few miles of New York\r\nCity the breeds which laid the white shelled egg were the only ones\r\nworthy of consideration, and, in the study of the question, it was\r\nfound there was another important matter confronting the egg farmer, as\r\nto the breed which he should keep, whether a setter, or a non-setter.\r\nOn an egg farm, where hundreds of layers are to be kept, if any of\r\nthe Asiatics, or so called American Breeds, were kept, they would be\r\na source of considerable added expense, first, in the way of loss of\r\neggs during their numerous broody periods; second, in the necessary\r\nbuildings in which to carry the “broody biddies” until they have become\r\nsensible, and are in a proper frame of mind to be returned to the\r\nLaying House. This might look on its face a small affair, but success\r\nto The Corning Egg Farm has come through watching every corner, and\r\nwhile sparing no needed expenditure, avoiding unnecessary and foolish\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nSo, to the man who would really meet with a large success, all the\r\nbreeds which lay the dark shelled egg, because of their setting\r\npropensity, must be eliminated.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the Mediterranean family are layers of the white\r\nshelled egg, and are what is termed “non-setting.”\r\n\r\n\r\nS. C. White Leghorns Outclass All\r\n\r\nBefore deciding we looked the different members of this family over\r\nwith considerable care, and we found that the Single Comb White Leghorn\r\nis the fowl that out-classes all the others for the purpose of an\r\negg farm. It is a bird, where properly bred, of great hardiness and\r\nstamina. It readily adapts itself to all conditions of climate, and,\r\nwhere the right “strain” is procured, it is never a disappointer as\r\nto the number, size, and the class of eggs which it produces. We,\r\ntherefore, decided to adopt the Single Comb White Leghorn, and we have\r\noutlined, in a previous chapter, how we went to work to build up the\r\nunequaled Corning Strain, by the most careful selection, and scientific\r\nmating.\r\n\r\nProf. Gowell, at the Maine Agricultural Station, carried on his\r\nbreeding with Barred Plymouth Rocks, and it is interesting to note\r\nthat his average for some eight years, taking his star performers,\r\nwas 134.27 eggs per hen for twelve months, while at The Corning Egg\r\nFarm the flocks of fifteen hundred pullets averaged per hen, for ten\r\nmonths laying, 143.25 eggs in 1909, and 145.11 eggs in 1910. Here was\r\na difference of two months in time, and yet the large flocks, taken as\r\na whole, not weeding out a few star performers, surpassed the twelve\r\nmonths’ record of the Barred Plymouth Rocks at the Maine Station by\r\nalmost nine eggs in 1909, and ten eggs in 1910. This significant\r\nfact made considerable impression on a number of breeders in the\r\nneighborhood of Boston, with the result that, in the last two years,\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm has supplied a large number of hatching eggs and\r\nconsiderable breeding stock for farms in New England.\r\n\r\nAs one gentleman from Boston pointed out, even with the difference in\r\nprice between the brown and the white egg, he found that he could not\r\nreally afford to continue with the breeds laying the brown egg, for the\r\nLeghorn, in numbers, more than made up for the slight difference in\r\nprice between the two colors, in the Boston Market. And, as he still\r\nfurther pointed out, it took less food to supply the Leghorn than it\r\ndid any of the larger breeds, and this, of course, was another source\r\nof economy.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the “Strain” of any breed is most\r\nimportant. One may purchase White Leghorns where the inbreeding has\r\nbeen so great that they are not capable of laying eggs in large\r\nnumbers, and the percentage of fertility from the hatching standpoint\r\nin such birds will be a most uncertain quantity. Such chicks as may\r\nbe hatched will be far from strong, and the mortality will run into\r\nfigures which will dishearten anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLine Breeding--Not Inbreeding\r\n\r\nIn the building up of a great strain of birds it is necessary to “line\r\nbreed,” for, if the old theory of introducing new blood to prevent\r\ninbreeding, and the method of introducing the new blood, was, as is\r\ndone in so many places even to-day, by introducing males from other\r\nsources, the entire system falls down. Nothing is accomplished and time\r\nis worse than wasted. The possibility of handing down the virtues of\r\nmother to daughter, and of father to son, is eliminated. If all the\r\nqualities of a given “Strain” are to be handed down line breeding must\r\nbe adhered to in the strictest sense. Inbreeding, however, must be\r\navoided, or disaster will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Corning Farm Produces Unrelated Cockerels\r\n\r\nThe Method of The Corning Egg Farm is as follows: a pen of carefully\r\nselected yearling hens is set aside in what is known as “the pen for\r\nthe production of unrelated cockerels.” A most carefully selected\r\ncockerel to every twelve hens is placed in the pen. Incubators are\r\nrun with eggs from this pen only, and the resulting chicks are marked\r\nbefore being placed in the Brooder House. The cockerels which appear\r\nwith this marking are grown to maturity, those coming up to our\r\nstandard being selected to head the breeding pens for the following\r\nseason. The marked pullets are placed in the Laying Houses with the\r\nother pullets, but are never selected for yearling breeders on our own\r\nFarm. In pens sold to others we always furnish unrelated cockerels.\r\n\r\nHaving hatched a sufficient number of chicks to produce about four\r\nhundred cockerels, no further eggs are set from this pen, and, at the\r\nend of the season, all the birds comprising this pen are sold.\r\n\r\nThis Method of line breeding hands down the laying quality which has\r\nbeen so developed, and which is being increased from season to season\r\nin an unbroken line, but inbreeding is absolutely avoided, and the\r\nvigor of the stock is maintained.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in closing the chapter, nothing could be more apt than a\r\nletter received from a Breeder of Crystal White Orpingtons, in the\r\nneighborhood of one of the large Western Cities. The letter-head, in\r\nlarge type, states, “Breeder of Crystal White Orpingtons, the Great\r\nWinter Layer.” The contents of the letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n“As I am now planning to go into the Egg business, and desire to follow\r\nyour method as closely as possible, and, while in this locality there\r\nis not such a marked preference for the white egg over the brown, still\r\nthe White Leghorn, of a good strain, doubtless outlays any other breed\r\nknown, and the shape of its egg is such that it is superior for table\r\nuse, to any laid by the dark shelled family. It, therefore, is my\r\npurpose, as rapidly as possible to work into a large flock of Leghorns,\r\nwith Corning stock as a basis.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the gentleman is a breeder of Crystal White\r\nOrpingtons, and prints in large type on his letter-head, “The Great\r\nWinter Layer,” but that when it comes down to “brass tacks,” from the\r\nstandpoint of the hen which will produce an egg for table use, and the\r\nhen that will give you the requisite number to make the dollars, the\r\nBreeder of the Crystal White Orpingtons wants to put in the Corning\r\nStrain of Single Comb White Leghorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAdvantages of the Large Flock System--Reduces Cost of Housing and\r\nEconomizes in Time and Labor\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years the floor space per hen has been an interesting study\r\nto anyone reading poultry literature, either in books or in magazine\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nSome fifteen years ago it was generally considered for a hen to do at\r\nall well she must have at least twenty square feet of floor space.\r\nLater, the number of feet was divided by half, and for some time ten\r\nsquare feet was considered to be the very least a hen could possibly do\r\nwith. Then we come to the four square feet period, and this created a\r\ngreat deal of controversy. Many writers declared that it was impossible\r\nfor any hen, no matter how housed, to do well in such a restricted\r\nspace. At times, some visionary writer pictured a flock in one house,\r\nof what was then considered an enormous size. One Professor of poultry\r\nwent so far as to state that he had successfully kept some three\r\nhundred hens in one flock, and had obtained most satisfactory results.\r\nThis statement, however, was denied by others, and the Professor wrote\r\nan article in which he set forth that, while he had done this, he would\r\nnever think of suggesting that the average poultry-keeper attempt it.\r\nIn his statement there were some truths that it is well to remember,\r\nnamely, that the average poultry-keeper would not give the flock the\r\ncare and supervision necessary to keep it in health. In other words,\r\nthe poultry-keeper would not attend to the necessary cleanliness, and\r\ndisease would break out, and, in the average poultry house, under such\r\nconditions, this would mean the total annihilation of the flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE STERILE LAYING HOUSES CONTAINING 4500 PULLETS,\r\nWITH A FLOOR SPACE OF 7680 SQUARE FEET]\r\n\r\n\r\nDraughts the Stumbling Block\r\n\r\nAs economy of space and labor is one of the main factors in getting\r\na commercial profit where poultry is operated with, the large flock\r\nsystem appealed most strongly to The Corning Egg Farm. Long houses,\r\nunder one roof, without divisions, had been attempted by others, and\r\nthe endeavor to discover the reason for the failures, where this had\r\nbeen attempted, was a very interesting study. It was found that the\r\nmain stumbling block in houses of this type was draughts. To eliminate\r\nthe draughts was the problem we then undertook to solve. It was found\r\nthat if the houses were built in sections of twenty feet, and the\r\npartitions which divided the house into roosting closets were extended\r\ntwelve inches beyond the dropping boards, and were carried from the\r\nfloor to the roof, the air currents were broken up, and the difficulty\r\nof draughts was overcome.\r\n\r\nHouses, as we believed in constructing them, were expensive, unless\r\nit was possible to carry a very large number of layers successfully\r\nin them. In studying the two hundred and twenty-five pullets as they\r\nworked contentedly in the No. 1 Laying House, which was but twelve feet\r\nwide, we became convinced that it was perfectly possible in a house\r\nsixteen feet wide by one hundred and sixty feet in length to carry\r\nfifteen hundred layers. This, to be sure, allowed the hen only a little\r\nover two square feet of floor space, with the dropping boards included.\r\nBut, as we figured it, the hen also had the entire house for floor\r\nspace, and, while it is true that fourteen hundred and ninety-nine\r\nsisters were her near neighbors, they all enjoyed the same large space\r\nto roam in. A house, then, of this size, accommodating fifteen hundred\r\nlayers, was not an expensive house per bird, and, when you consider\r\nthat the construction was such that the up-keep was practically\r\nnothing, it became not only not an expensive house, but really a very\r\ncheap one.\r\n\r\nThe success of the fifteen hundred layers in one house proved itself at\r\nonce, and we never have seen the slightest necessity for altering the\r\nplan of the Laying House, as we first laid it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n2,000 Birds to a House\r\n\r\nThe large flock system works economies, then, in housing, in the amount\r\nof labor necessary to care for the birds, and in gathering the eggs.\r\nAnd there is no doubt but that a house of considerably greater length,\r\nwith a flock ranging as high as two thousand birds, could successfully\r\nbe handled. In fact, on one farm which has been in existence over\r\ntwenty-five years, a Corning Method Laying House of two hundred feet\r\nin length has been in operation now for twelve months, and the owners\r\nwrite us that it is the most successful house on their entire farm,\r\nand that as rapidly as possible they are rebuilding all their Laying\r\nHouses, and making them of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWhat is the Winter Layer?--The Properly Hatched and Reared Pullet\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people have a very erroneous idea with regard to getting Winter\r\neggs. They seem to think any hen should produce eggs in Winter. The hen\r\ngenerally moults in the early Fall, and Nature has provided this time\r\nof rest for her. The egg organs cease to produce, for the hen finds she\r\nhas all she can do to supply the necessary material for her new dress,\r\nand this is a very serious drain on her system. The natural time,\r\nhowever, for a pullet to begin to lay is when she reaches maturity,\r\nand, as the pullet hatched in the early Spring, properly cared for,\r\nshould come into eggs in the early Fall, the pullet, then, is the\r\nWinter layer.\r\n\r\nIt must still be remembered that the domesticated fowl of to-day is\r\na bird of evolution. In its wild state a pullet did not begin to lay\r\neggs in the Fall, and neither did she lay a large number of eggs at\r\nany time. With the coming of Spring, and an abundance of succulent\r\ngreen food, and large quantities of animal food in the shape of a\r\ngreat variety of worms and insects, she laid and hatched her brood.\r\nTherefore, to have successful Winter layers, it is necessary to produce\r\nas nearly as possible the Spring-time conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR LAYING HOUSE NO. 1 IN 1910]\r\n\r\n\r\nMust Feed Green Food\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm, when the pullets are brought up from the Range\r\ninto the Laying Houses, the majority of them have already been laying\r\non the Range, and they are in fit condition to be brought strongly\r\ninto eggs. They are fed a large quantity of succulent green food, in\r\nthe form which, perhaps, is more delicious to the hen than any other,\r\nthat is, Sprouted Oats. The quantity of animal food in their mash is\r\nincreased, and, with the vigorous digging for the grain in the deep\r\nlitter, the problem of Winter eggs is solved, and from day to day, the\r\nnumber of eggs coming from the pullet houses, increases very rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pullet which has completed its first ten months\r\nof laying is well advanced in the moult, and is becoming a yearling\r\nhen. Those qualifying under the drastic examination for perfect type\r\nare selected for the next year’s Breeders, and are removed to the\r\nBreeding Houses, which have been thoroughly disinfected and put in the\r\nmost sanitary condition to receive them. Those not reaching the Corning\r\nStandard are marketed, as we sell culls only to the butcher.\r\n\r\nThe aim in handling the yearling hen is not to get eggs from her\r\nduring the Winter, but to give her a long rest, and to build her up,\r\nand put her in the pink of condition for the coming breeding season,\r\nand it is the aim at The Corning Egg Farm to have as few eggs produced\r\nas possible from the breeding pens until about the first of January,\r\nwhen an increased amount of animal food is added to the daily ration\r\nfor the purpose of bringing the hens into eggs, and within a few days\r\nthere is a very rapid increase in the number of eggs from these pens.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the profit in Winter eggs is made from\r\npullets, and to be successful in this line the Laying Houses must be\r\nwell stocked with them.\r\n\r\nYearling and two year old hens are the proper breeding females. The\r\nCorning Egg Farm Method is one of continuous rotation, as follows:\r\n\r\nIncubator to Brooder House.\r\n\r\nBrooder House to Range.\r\n\r\nRange to Laying House. Those selected as coming up to the Corning\r\nStandard go to the Breeder House.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second year the Breeders are all sold for foundation\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThis gives an opportunity to the public to procure the very best\r\nBreeders at a most reasonable price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA Great Laying Strain--The Selection of Breeders to Produce It\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first requisite is to breed from a mature animal, from a real\r\nyearling hen. The term “yearling hen” is a misnomer, for, when she\r\nis twelve months of age she has not as a rule developed into a true\r\nyearling hen. The female has five months of growth, ten months of\r\nlaying, and then she moults, which process varies in duration from\r\neight to ten weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteen Months Old\r\n\r\nWhen she has completed the moult, her entire anatomy has undergone a\r\nchange, and she is a mature animal, about eighteen months of age, a fit\r\nspecimen to reproduce her kind, and her off-spring will be strong and\r\nvigorous youngsters.\r\n\r\nThe great mortality one reads of among chicks can be traced more to\r\nbreeding from immature females than to any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe general method of selecting breeders for a great many years has\r\nbeen by the use of “trap nests.” Surely the use of a mechanical device\r\nis a poor method to determine what hens are proper for breeding\r\npurposes, and really the trap nest tells you nothing.\r\n\r\nIn every pen there are daily a number of eggs which are not laid in\r\nthe nest at all. To what particular hen does the attendant credit eggs\r\nfound in hollows scooped out in corners under the dropping boards?\r\nIt is a peculiarity of “Biddy” that where she sees an egg she almost\r\nalways decides it is a good and proper place for her to lay another.\r\nThus, on some days, where trap nests are in use, it may be necessary\r\nto make a great number of guesses as to which hen did not lay in the\r\ntraps, but on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrap Nests a Failure\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why trap nests really tell you nothing. Take\r\ntwo females of a pen whose numbers are one and two. For the first few\r\nweeks No. 1 surpasses her sister No. 2 in the production of eggs. To\r\nthis pen, clover has been the green food fed, and of this ingredient\r\nthe farm has run short. The shipment has been expected daily but did\r\nnot arrive, and, because of that failure, for four or five days no\r\nother green food was provided. Then cabbage was resorted to to take\r\nthe place of the clover. The pen having been without green food for a\r\nnumber of days was fairly greedy for it, and good, crisp cabbage suits\r\nthe palate of many hens exactly, and they are very apt to overdo the\r\nmatter in eating it. A great layer must be a large eater, and so hen\r\nNo. 1 gorged herself on the cabbage. Her digestive organs were upset,\r\nand for a number of weeks she ceased laying, while hen No. 2 continued\r\nto shell out a fair number of eggs. The owner of these birds, when\r\nit came time for the selection of the breeders, expressed his great\r\ndisappointment over hen No. 1. She had started so well, and then had\r\nblown up entirely, and so she is passed up, and hen No. 2 is accepted\r\nas a breeder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE BREEDING HOUSES JUST AFTER MATING 1910]\r\n\r\nNow, if the anatomy of these two birds had been studied, it would have\r\nbeen found at once that hen No. 1 was much better qualified to take a\r\nplace in the breeding pen than hen No. 2. The mere fact that the trap\r\nnest record of any female shows a phenomenal number of eggs laid in ten\r\nor twelve months does not necessarily prove that she is a proper animal\r\nto breed from. Post-mortem examinations show in many cases that they\r\nare freaks, and, while they have laid a great number of eggs, there was\r\nmuch to be desired in regard to the eggs, as to their size, shape, and\r\ncolor. As a matter of fact it would have been a great mistake to have\r\nbred from such an individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nType Reproduces Type\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that type produces type, and the only proper way\r\nto select birds for the breeding pen which will produce progeny capable\r\nof great egg production is to thoroughly understand their anatomy. It\r\nis impossible to produce a great performer in any line unless the\r\nanimal is of a build capable of the performance. No one would expect to\r\nbreed a two-minute trotter from a Shetland Pony.\r\n\r\nThe hen which is capable of becoming an ideal layer must have a deep\r\nkeel, a long body, and, as she faces out, she must have an appearance\r\nof broadness, and must be the shape of a wedge back to the point where\r\nthe wings join the body.\r\n\r\nThe Large Flock System is carried on in the Breeding Pen on The Corning\r\nEgg Farm, and it has been most successful. It has been found that the\r\nsmall pen does not produce the high fertility continuously which the\r\nLarge Flock System does. During the season of 1910, for long periods,\r\nthe fertility ran as high as 96%, and as early as the first of March it\r\nwas above 90%. In the season of 1911, eggs incubated in the early part\r\nof February, ran above 91%, and during the season there were times when\r\nthe fertility reached 97%.\r\n\r\nThe Breeding Pens are mated up two weeks before eggs are to be used for\r\nincubation, and early hatched cockerels are used to head these Breeding\r\nPens. It has been found that the mating of cockerels with yearling hens\r\nproduces a very decided predominance of pullets, and the youngsters are\r\nstrong and vigorous from the start.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of mating is one to twelve, and the records of The\r\nCorning Egg Farm show that by this method of mating the number of\r\ncockerels produced, through the years that the Farm has been in\r\noperation, has been as low as one-quarter, and as high as one-third.\r\n\r\nThe males to head the pens are selected with the same care that the\r\nhens are. They are all perfect birds, of large size, and conform as\r\nclosely as possible to the standard requirements, without interfering\r\nwith the paramount aim of producing a Great Layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWhat is the Best Time to Hatch?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question which is the title of this chapter is asked over and over\r\nagain. You see it propounded to the editor of almost every poultry\r\npaper in the country. And it is a difficult one to answer, because\r\nthe various needs of different people are so diversified. April and\r\nMay are doubtless the natural hatching seasons for all varieties.\r\nClimatic conditions are then kinder, the food which is necessary for\r\nthe production of many eggs, and eggs of the strong hatchable kind, is\r\nsupplied by Nature in great abundance, and the young chick coming into\r\nlife in these months finds a great variety of natural food of the very\r\nbest kind for growth awaiting it. In Spring eggs run strongly fertile,\r\nand in every way Nature seems to lend herself to successful hatching,\r\nand the starting of the young chick properly on its journey.\r\n\r\nThe man, however, who is operating an egg farm, and has made contracts\r\nfor the delivery of a continuous supply of eggs to exacting customers,\r\ncannot well afford to wait until these months to hatch in, for it is\r\nnecessary for him to have a large number of pullets reaching maturity\r\nand beginning to lay, before his last year’s pullets reach the\r\nmoulting period and stop egg production. To accomplish this it is\r\nnecessary to have in his brooder house, by not later than the first\r\nweek of March, a goodly number of yellow babies. From that time on he\r\nmust keep them coming, so as to have a sufficient number a few weeks\r\napart to take the place of the yearling hens going into the moult. In\r\nthis way he will succeed in keeping up a continuous flow of eggs.\r\n\r\nIt is true there is a danger in these early hatched pullets. They may\r\ngo into what is called the Winter moult, after laying well into the\r\nmonth of December, but they will not all moult, and before there is a\r\nmarked shrinkage the later hatches will be laying strongly.\r\n\r\nThe moult which occurs with early hatched birds does not last as long\r\nas the moult coming in the regular season. The birds soon return to the\r\nnest, and the house rapidly jumps back to a very large output of eggs\r\nfor the coming Spring months. Thus the great increase in numbers helps\r\nto offset the decrease in price, and to equalize the bank account.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that Leghorns hatched up to the 25th of\r\nJune make good Winter layers provided they are properly cared for, and\r\ngiven the food and attention which produces a great growth, and under\r\nsuch conditions one will find no difficulty in getting them into laying\r\neggs readily by the time they are five months of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Interesting Experiment in Late Hatching\r\n\r\nIn the season of 1910 The Corning Egg Farm made a very interesting\r\nexperiment, in a large way, so far as late hatching goes. We incubated\r\ntwo large batches of eggs, the first being set so that the chicks\r\nhatched from the 18th to the 26th of July; the second batch completed\r\nincubation August 15th. The resulting pullets from these two hatches\r\nwere some fifty odd over twelve hundred. We carried them on Range until\r\nDecember 1st, and then placed them in a Laying House by themselves.\r\nThey had not begun to lay on Range so far as we were able to discover,\r\nalthough many of the pullets had the appearance of eggs. Almost from\r\nthe start, after they were placed in the Colony Houses, we fed them, in\r\naddition to the regular Range ration, a good supply of Sprouted Oats\r\neach day. This was done for the reason that of course the succulent\r\ngreen food had passed away, and we consider it of vital importance\r\nthat growing birds be given the opportunity to gather a large supply\r\nof succulent green food. The records show that within three days after\r\nthe pullets were placed in the Laying House we began to gather from one\r\nto three eggs a day. Before December was over the house was producing\r\n10%; January saw 35% output of eggs, and before February was very far\r\nadvanced we were doing better than 60%. There was a time in March when\r\nthe House was yielding a 75% output.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPROUTED OATS CELLAR]\r\n\r\nThese birds laid strongly all Summer, and we were interested in noting\r\nwhen they would start to moult. We had seen the statement made a number\r\nof times that late hatched pullets were very late moulters. In our\r\nexperience, however, this did not prove to be true, for this pen of\r\nbirds moulted at just about the same time, and in the same proportion,\r\nas the earlier hatches did.\r\n\r\nWe had frequently seen it stated that birds hatched in the very last\r\nweek of August, or the first week in September, would produce eggs at\r\nthe same time that the June hatched pullets would begin to produce\r\nthem. Our experience with June hatches, and we have had four years of\r\nit, disproves this statement absolutely. We find that the June hatched\r\npullet, properly cared for, comes in quite as rapidly as those hatched\r\nin April and May.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to go on record as advocates of July and August\r\nhatching, but we simply wish to show what could be accomplished if a\r\nBreeder met with some misfortune, and was compelled to hatch late or\r\nnot at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSucculent Green Food--Satisfactory Egg Production Impossible Without It\r\n\r\n\r\nA goodly supply of green food is necessary to all birds, the growing\r\nchicken as well as the yearling hen, for it is a great aid to\r\ndigestion, helping to properly assimilate all foods as they are taken\r\ninto the crop, and passed through the great grinding mill of a chicken.\r\n\r\nThere is no possible hope of a full egg supply from any Laying House\r\nwhere a large quantity of green food is not fed daily. It may be fed\r\nin many forms. Clover or Alfalfa (and we are now speaking first of\r\nthe Winter supply of green food) may be procured in a dry state, and\r\nby properly scalding it with hot water it may be made to almost live\r\nagain, so far as its freshness and delightful odor go. In many cases\r\nthe preparation of Clover or Alfalfa spoils it. The water should be\r\nquite at the boiling point, and it should be poured over, preferably it\r\nshould be put on with a sprinkling can. The method at The Corning Egg\r\nFarm is to place whichever we are using of the Clover family in pails,\r\na given number for each Laying House, and as they stand in rows the hot\r\nwater is applied with a sprinkling can. The contents are not allowed\r\nto steep, but as soon as the second wetting of the long row of pails\r\nis reached they are placed on the delivery wagon and at once taken to\r\ntheir destination. When the contents are emptied from the pails they\r\nwill be steaming hot, too hot for the birds to take at first, and you\r\nwill find them standing in a ring around the Clover, and from time to\r\ntime testing the heat. As soon as it is cool enough they will devour it\r\nwith great avidity.\r\n\r\nWhere Alfalfa is fed some flocks give considerable difficulty at first\r\nas they do not seem to relish it, but after a short time they seem to\r\nacquire the taste, and become very fond of it. It contains a higher\r\namount of protein than the ordinary Clover which can be bought in the\r\nmarket, but in purchasing Alfalfa products one should be careful not to\r\nbuy a large quantity of dirt, but get what is known as “short cut,” and\r\nhave it carefully sifted.\r\n\r\nBy many people cabbages are considered a most excellent green food\r\nfor Winter use, but if they are chopped up and fed to the layers\r\nconsiderable caution should be used in the feeding. They are very apt\r\nto upset the digestive organs of the birds, and that means a very\r\ndecided decrease in the number of eggs. This is equally true of Mangle\r\nbeets and other roots which in many cases are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nSprouted Oats Best\r\n\r\nAt The Corning Egg Farm we are strong believers in Sprouted Oats as a\r\ngreen food, and we now maintain a cement Cellar, with good drainage,\r\nwhich is used for nothing else. The method of sprouting oats is really\r\nvery simple, and does not require the arduous labor which one would\r\nimagine from numerous articles written on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow They Are Grown on the Farm\r\n\r\nWe have frames three by six feet in size, built of ordinary boards,\r\nbut not matched material. The sides are about four inches high. These\r\nframes are laid on the floor of the Cellar, and each frame is filled\r\nwith forty-eight quarts of oats spread evenly over the bottom. We have\r\na large sprinkler attached to the hose, and the oats are thoroughly wet\r\nas they lie in the trays, and this wetting is repeated every morning.\r\nIn a temperature from fifty to sixty degrees we find that the oats have\r\nstarted to sprout about the third day, and from this on the growth\r\nis very fast. Parts of the oats in the frame will swell two or three\r\ninches in places, above the surrounding mass of oats, and we make it a\r\npractice to place the sprinkler directly on top of this swelling, and\r\nit is found by so doing that the frame in a short time will present a\r\nvery even growth.\r\n\r\nIf the Sprouted Oats are fed when the green tops are from one and a\r\nhalf to two inches in length the chemical quality of the oat is not\r\nlost, and we really get a double ration when it is fed. If allowed to\r\ngo beyond this length, they are then just an ordinary green food.\r\n\r\nIn many instances we have noticed writers advocating soaking the oats\r\novernight, and then, for the next few days, to periodically stir them.\r\nAnd in other cases writers advise, when they are placed in the frames\r\nto turn the oats over. This is a serious mistake, for anyone can\r\nreadily see that the tender shoots, which grow most rapidly after the\r\nthird day, would be broken off, and where this occurs the oats will rot.\r\n\r\nOats, of course, can be sprouted in sheds, or even out-of-doors, if\r\nthey are covered up so that the sun will not dry them out too rapidly.\r\n\r\nA frame should be made in such a manner that the water sprayed over\r\nthe oats will slowly drain away. There are a number of different\r\ncontrivances now being placed on the market for sprouting oats, and we\r\nhave no doubt that, on small plants, some of them would prove quite\r\nsatisfactory. Where it is desired to sprout oats in a small way, in\r\nthe Cellar of one’s house, a rack can be built with run-ways for the\r\ntrays to slide on, with a space of two inches between the trays. By\r\nthoroughly sprinkling the top tray the water will run down through from\r\none tray to another, and, as the growth progresses, the more advanced\r\nones can be moved up from the bottom of the rack, as they require less\r\nwater than those in a less advanced stage.\r\n\r\nThe oats sprout more quickly if grown and sprinkled in a fairly dark\r\nplace, and it must be remembered that too warm a temperature will rot\r\nthe mass after the growth has reached its fourth or fifth day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimothy and Clover Cut Green\r\n\r\nAs one enters The Corning Egg Farm, on the left of the drive, there is\r\nabout an acre of Timothy and Clover. This acre has been very heavily\r\nfertilized and brought up to a high state of cultivation. The Timothy\r\nand Clover grow so rapidly, and the growth comes in such abundance\r\nalmost before the snow is off the ground, that cutting it as we do,\r\nso many rows each morning, it is impossible to cross the entire plot\r\nbefore that which was first cut has almost grown beyond the succulent\r\npoint. To make a change for the hens we cut this in the early Spring,\r\nand pass it through the Clover Cutter, reducing it to quarter inch\r\nlengths, but we find that after the first few days of feeding the hens\r\nshow a decided preference for Sprouted Oats, and now we make it a rule\r\nto feed the Timothy and Clover one day and the Sprouted Oats the next.\r\nThis works very well, and the “Biddies” seem to enjoy the different\r\nrations on alternate days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO WEEKS OLD CHICKS IN BROODER HOUSE RUNS]\r\n\r\nThe Colony Range is so cared for and fertilized that the growing\r\npullet, for the Spring and Summer months, finds an unlimited supply of\r\nsucculent green food at her door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAnthracite Coal Ashes--A Substitute for Many More Expensive Necessities\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feather of a bird is composed almost entirely of phosphorous, and\r\nphosphorous is a great aid to the bird in digesting food. In fact,\r\nthere are manufactured “grits” offered on the market, which base their\r\nefficiency on the amount of phosphorous they carry.\r\n\r\nAnthracite, or hard, coal ashes, carry a considerable quantity of\r\nphosphorous, and this is the reason chickens in all stages of their\r\nexistence are so fond of them. Our attention was first called to this\r\nfact by observing the large number of pullets on the Colony Range,\r\nwhere some loads of ashes had been used the previous season in mixing\r\nwith the fertilizer for the growing of potatoes. It was noticed that\r\nthese small heaps of ashes were very soon consumed, and when they\r\nwere replenished the pullets were never absent from the piles. The\r\nexperiment was then made of placing a small heap at the extreme end of\r\nthe chick runs from the Brooder House, and to our surprise we found one\r\nwas unable to see the ashes because of the moving mass of yellow which\r\ncovered them. It was necessary to replenish these heaps almost daily.\r\nAs ashes are perfectly sanitary we decided to cover the entire chick\r\nrun with them, which we did, and every few days, through the brooding\r\nseason, a fresh coating is necessary, as the youngsters consume so much\r\nof the surface constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter Than Charcoal\r\n\r\nNext, we sifted ashes and filled the hoppers in the Laying Houses with\r\nthem. The layers ate them in the same way in which they consumed wheat.\r\nFor an experiment we stopped feeding charcoal entirely, and found that\r\nthe ashes supplied everything that the charcoal did, with none of the\r\ndangers, for there seems to be no doubt that where hens consume large\r\nquantities of charcoal they are very susceptible to colds.\r\n\r\nLarge heaps of Anthracite ashes are now kept within a short distance\r\nof every Colony House on the Range, and the use of these ashes has\r\nvery materially reduced the quantity of Grit and Shell consumed, thus\r\nrepresenting a considerable economy.\r\n\r\nUntil the use of Anthracite ashes came in on the Range we placed Grit\r\nin receptacles near each Colony House, and the amount consumed was\r\nreally remarkable. As soon as the ashes were placed there the Grit was\r\ndeserted, and there practically was no consumption of it at all, and\r\nafter a few weeks we ceased to supply it and have not done so now for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSince the use of the sifted ashes in the Laying Houses a soft shelled\r\negg is almost a curiosity on the Farm.\r\n\r\nIn the Brooder House runs, beside supplying the phosphorus to the\r\nyoungsters for their digestion, and the making of their feathers, it\r\ndoes away with the fear of contamination of soil, of which so much is\r\nnow written, and it presents a surface which dries almost before the\r\nrain storm is over, and there is no possibility of the youngsters being\r\nlet out into a muddy run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEggs for Breeding Should be Laid by a Real Yearling Hen\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving heard many stories told by Breeders who were sellers of eggs\r\nfor hatching, and also the tales by purchasers, we were somewhat loath\r\nto embark in this branch of the Egg Trade. The Breeders told stories\r\nof letters which would “raise your hair” from people who had purchased\r\nfrom them and met with poor success, and of course, from their point of\r\nview, the only person at fault was the man who sold the eggs.\r\n\r\nFor the season of 1910 our breeding pen had reached a size which\r\nallowed us, for the first time, to offer eggs to the public, and\r\nwe decided to try it out. To everyone we stated that we would not\r\nguarantee fertility, but, as they were getting eggs from exactly the\r\nsame pens which were supplying our own incubators, we were able, at all\r\ntimes, to tell what the customer was receiving. But we went further,\r\nand agreed that anyone claiming a low fertility, if he would send us\r\nthe eggs which he claimed to be clear, and prepay the expressage, we\r\nwould, if his claim was substantiated, send him another lot of eggs\r\nand pay the expressage both ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n90,000 Orders for 40,000 Eggs\r\n\r\nDuring the season of 1910 we sold something over 40,000 eggs and\r\nreturned money for about 50,000 beyond our ability to supply. The\r\nresult was that many people who were disappointed booked orders at very\r\nearly dates in 1910 for hatching eggs for the season of 1911.\r\n\r\nOur experience was quite the reverse from the stories we had been\r\ntold. Of course, in doing a large business, it is not possible to\r\nsatisfy everyone, and then, unfortunately, there are some people who\r\nare extremely fond of attempting to get something for nothing, and you\r\nreceive statements regarding orders which have been filled, which when\r\ninvestigated, prove to be somewhat different from what you were at\r\nfirst led to believe.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of our eggs was such that it was almost impossible for\r\nanyone to make a complaint, and the hatching season of 1910, both at\r\nthe Farm and for our customers, was a most successful one.\r\n\r\nFor the season of 1911 we were able to increase our breeding facilities\r\nconsiderably over 1910, but we were even more unable to meet the\r\ndemands upon us for hatching eggs, than in the previous season. The\r\nresults of this year were quite as satisfactory as for the previous,\r\nand for the season of 1912 the Farm will be in a position to fill more\r\norders than ever before, as we have been able to make a still greater\r\nincrease on the breeding side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YEARLING HENS IN BREEDER HOUSE BEFORE MATING READY FOR\r\n1912]\r\n\r\nOrders for hatching eggs are booked by such a system that people\r\nreceive them when we agree to deliver the goods, and the illustration\r\nherewith plainly shows the plan.\r\n\r\n  $........

For a number of\r\nyears people in the vicinity of the The Corning Egg Farm have met with\r\nlosses, and in the year 1910 an organized gang was unearthed, which\r\nhad a camp on the adjacent hills, and made nightly raids, then shipped\r\nthe birds by crossing the Watchung Mountains and reaching railroad\r\ncommunication on the other side, sending their stolen feathered plunder\r\ninto the New York Market.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoot First--Investigate Afterwards\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm takes a great many precautions in regard to\r\nefficient policing, and has earned a reputation for straight shooting,\r\nnot with a gun carrying bird shot, but with rifles. It is thoroughly\r\nunderstood for miles around that we shoot first and investigate\r\nafterwards. The farm carries some of the finest Blood Hounds in the\r\nCountry, all trained man-trailers, and it is thoroughly understood\r\nthat if the rifle fails to stop a thief, and it becomes desirable to\r\nsee him, the hounds will take up the trail the next day, and no matter\r\nwhere he may have gone there will be no difficulty in reaching him.\r\nShould he take train the dogs will tell the fact, and then it will be\r\nonly necessary to try each station until the one is reached where he\r\nleft the train. Should he leave by means of a horse, when he either\r\ngets into the wagon, or mounts the horse, the hound will take the\r\nscent, and carry it until he again takes to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “SOCRATES,” THE GREAT BLOODHOUND WHICH HEADS THE CORNING\r\nKENNELS]\r\n\r\n\r\nSocrates, the Great Bloodhound\r\n\r\nThe head of the kennel, “Socrates,” No. 127320, (his registered name\r\nis “Ottawa’s Major”) is a direct descendant from Rosemary and Delhi,\r\nthe two great dogs of Mr. Burgh, of England, who for years has been\r\nthe leading breeder of man-trailing Blood Hounds. Altogether the Farm\r\nto-day is carrying seventeen dogs. Fifteen of them are pure and grade\r\nBlood Hounds; two are Fox Terriers. The Fox Terriers are kept for a\r\nbreed of thieves other than the two-legged kind, and rats have no place\r\non which to rest the soles of their feet.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, every night, are distributed at different points of the Farm,\r\nand one of the great qualities of the Blood Hound is its marvelous\r\nnose, which works just as well in the dark as in the light, and as\r\nwatch dogs, because of this peculiarity, they are most efficient,\r\ngiving notice of anyone approaching the Farm long before he could\r\npossibly be detected by a dog of another breed. When they give tongue\r\nthere is no doubt in the mind of anyone but that he is approaching a\r\nvery dangerous zone.\r\n\r\nOn the Foreman’s Apartments there is a Tower which connects with his\r\nroom, the windows of which command a view of every part of the Farm.\r\nIn this Tower there is a searchlight, and at any time of the night, if\r\nthe dogs give warning of a possible disturber, any part of the Farm can\r\nbe instantly flooded with light. Back of the search light is the high\r\npower rifle.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Range there is a trolley system which is used, the\r\noverhead wire being so divided that each dog has a run of one hundred\r\nfeet, and the leash attached to the sliding pulley gives him twenty\r\nfeet on either side of the wire. This makes a complete circuit of the\r\nColony Range, so that it is impossible for anyone to cross in among the\r\nColony Houses without being reached by one of the dogs.\r\n\r\nWe have been breeding some grade hounds, which make a rather more\r\nferocious animal than the pure breed, so far as natural disposition\r\ngoes. The nose quality, however, is all retained, thus enabling these\r\ngrades to become perfect trailers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOCRATES II AND DIOGENES\r\n\r\nSons of the Great Socrates]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUSTER, AMERICA’S GREATEST RATTER]\r\n\r\nIt is well on any egg farm to establish a reputation for being in a\r\nposition to always place a marauder behind the bars, and nothing so\r\ninsures protection as the knowledge that on the Farm there are carried\r\ndogs which are capable of trailing a trespasser wherever he may go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Necessity for Pure Water--An Egg is Chemically 80% Water\r\n\r\n\r\nEighty per cent. of an egg is water. If a sanitary egg is to be\r\nproduced it is most essential that pure water should be accessible to\r\nthe hens at all times, and not only should the water be pure, but the\r\ndrinking fountains must be of such a nature that they can readily be\r\nkept in a pure state, and that the cups, into which the water flows\r\nfrom the main fountain, cannot be fouled by the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Fountains Essential\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm the supply of water is placed before the\r\nbirds in automatic fountains, which work on air pressure, and contain\r\nfive gallons each. The water feeds down through a pipe into the\r\ncups, the feeding pipe shutting off by the turning of a small cock,\r\nthus permitting the removal of the cup, so that it can be thoroughly\r\ncleansed each day at the time of filling the fountain, by the use of\r\na small brush, or swab. Once a week a quarter of a teaspoonful of\r\nPotassium Permanganate is put into each fountain, just enough to give\r\nthe water a slight coloring. It is a mistake to have the color so deep\r\nthat it verges on the purple. This purifies the fountain and acts as a\r\npreventive of colds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNING AUTOMATIC DRINKING FOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\nIt is a very good practice also to occasionally put a few drops of\r\nKerosene oil into the bottom of the cup and then allow the water to run\r\nin. The Kerosene will run over the entire surface of the cup and then\r\nrise to the top of the water. As the birds dip their bills to drink a\r\nsmall amount of the Kerosene is taken up on the bill, and, when the\r\nhead is thrown back to swallow it runs into the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe drinking fountains are occasionally thoroughly cleansed with a\r\nstrong solution of Washing Soda. This, of course, is carefully washed\r\nout of the fountains before they are filled up and placed in the Laying\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHot Water in Cold Weather\r\n\r\nIn the Breeding and Laying Houses during the cold months, hot water\r\nis placed in the fountains. On The Corning Egg Farm a large boiler,\r\nwith a hot water attachment, is maintained for this purpose, and water\r\nis taken to the Laying Houses at as close to boiling point as it is\r\npossible to get it there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHens Drink More in Afternoon\r\n\r\nAt first the watering was done early in the morning, but now the\r\nwatering hour has been changed to the first hour of the afternoon.\r\nThe reason for this is because, by sitting in the Laying Houses\r\nand watching the birds, it was discovered that from one o’clock to\r\nroosting time more water is consumed than at any other hours of\r\nthe day. At first it was thought that Biddy, on leaving her roost,\r\nimmediately sought the drinking fountain, but we find the first act,\r\ngenerally speaking, is to endeavor to fill the crop with grain, and she\r\nvigorously starts to work in the litter.\r\n\r\nBy placing the hot water in the fountains during the hour after noon,\r\nwe find that with the closing of the house for the night, the water\r\nretains its temperature to a remarkable degree, and it is not at all\r\nchilling to the birds in the morning of ordinary cold weather. If the\r\nnight has been an extremely cold one we make it a practice of going\r\nthrough the Houses with boiling water, emptying out what may be in the\r\ncups, and refilling them from the hot water can, thus giving any bird\r\nwhich may desire a large quantity, warm water to drink at this time in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nThe supply of water for all the stock on The Corning Egg Farm comes\r\nfrom the deep well, already described in the chapter on “Building the\r\nFarm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHard Coal Ashes, Oyster Shell, and Grit\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated in the chapter on “Anthracite Coal Ashes,” ashes have\r\nentirely taken the place of charcoal on The Corning Egg Farm. They\r\nare fed in hoppers with the Grit and Oyster Shell. These hoppers are\r\ndivided into three compartments, and are automatic in feeding down the\r\ningredients, in small quantities at a time, for Biddy’s use.\r\n\r\nIt is very essential to supply the hen with the proper grinding\r\nmaterial for operation in her mill, for, from the crop, what she takes\r\ninto her system in the way of grain, etc., is passed into the gizzard,\r\nwhere she places a certain amount of hard, sharp stones, to use as\r\nmill stones, and this great muscular organ then puts the food into the\r\nproper condition for her to assimilate it.\r\n\r\nThe Grit placed in the hoppers is hard and sharp. Ordinary pebbles are\r\nof no use to Biddy in preparing her food for digestion. There are a\r\ngreat many different grits on the market sold through Poultry Supply\r\nHouses, and by the manufacturers themselves. Where it is possible to\r\nprocure Grit having the essentials as already described, and carrying a\r\ngood percentage of lime, it adds very materially to the desirability\r\nof the Grit.\r\n\r\nOyster Shell occupies the third compartment of the hoppers, this\r\nsupplying the hen with the lime necessary for her own system and for\r\nthe shell of the egg. It should be seen to that the Oyster Shell is\r\nfree from dust, and rather coarse as to its size. This represents an\r\neconomy because there is so little waste by the fowls when the Shell is\r\nfed to them in this condition. The lack of lime in the system of the\r\nhen is one of the reasons for soft shelled eggs, and the lack of lime\r\nin the ingredients fed to a young chick means soft bones, which shows\r\nmost decidedly in leg weaknesses.\r\n\r\nWhere the hen is supplied with the full quantity of the ingredients\r\nwhich give her lime, she turns out eggs which you might term “well\r\nshelled” and this adds materially to the appearance of the egg, and,\r\nconsequently, helps to give it a better grading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nBeef Scrap and Green Bone Substitutes for Nature’s Animal Food\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the ideal animal food for the hen, if it were possible to\r\nprocure it in sufficient quantities the year round, would be angle\r\nworms, grasshoppers, and other members of the insect family, which the\r\nearly Spring supplies in such liberal quantities. It must be remembered\r\nthat in these different worms and insects there is a large amount of\r\nphosphorous, which adds very greatly to the ability of the hen to\r\nsuccessfully digest the large quantity of food which is necessary, if\r\nshe is to produce a large quantity of eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Cut Bone Nearest Nature\r\n\r\nThe thing, perhaps, nearest in an artificial way to Nature’s animal\r\nfood, is green cut bone, and it is certainly relished by the hens, and\r\na great assistance in producing Winter eggs. The exercise of great\r\ncare, however, in the selection of bone is very necessary, for, if salt\r\nbone, or tainted bone, is cut up and fed to the fowls, it will prove\r\nmost detrimental, and in many instances will mean the loss of the hen.\r\n\r\nFor those who do not find it possible to set up the necessary\r\nbone-cutting machinery there are numerous brands of “Beef Scrap” on the\r\nmarket. This is made from green bone and meat which is then cooked,\r\nground and pressed, so as to preserve it fresh and sweet. This also\r\nis a most successful way to supply the hens with the necessary amount\r\nof animal food. It is readily mixed into the mash, just as the green\r\ncut bone is, and, where the proper mechanical mixer is used, it is\r\npossible to thoroughly coat the entire meal mixture with the oily\r\ncondition coming from the beef scrap, and until one has seen beef scrap\r\nmixed into the mash by such a mixer he has no idea how successful the\r\noperation is in preparing a high grade mash. The beef scrap and also\r\nthe fresh cut bone carry a high percentage of phosphorus, and in fact\r\nhave about all the ingredients found in animal food secured by the hen\r\nwhile running on Range.\r\n\r\nThere are now appearing numerous advertisements of a prepared fish,\r\nto take the place of other animal foods, but The Corning Egg Farm is\r\nunable to give any opinion as to the efficiency of this preparation. It\r\nhas been the rule at the Farm, when we have thoroughly tested and found\r\nsatisfactory any article of food, not to experiment with the various\r\nsubstitutes which at all times are so widely advertised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA Time for Everything--Everything on Time\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any business, or occupation, that one attempts to carry on\r\nsuccessfully there must be system. Nature teaches system, and the hen,\r\nas a part of Nature, is a very regular performer. She does everything\r\non time, and at a given time, and if her routine is broken in upon she\r\nis a very much upset individual. The owner who rudely disturbs her\r\nroutine suffers in the loss of eggs.\r\n\r\nThe schedule of work among the fowls on The Corning Egg Farm is without\r\nvariation each day. In Summer the houses are always open and need\r\nno attention in the morning, but in Winter the drops are raised in\r\nordinarily cold weather, as soon as it is light enough to enable the\r\nhens to work in the litter for grain. On very cold mornings the raising\r\nof the drops is deferred until the Sun is up, and when this is done the\r\ndrinking cups in the fountains are filled with hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixed Feeding Hours\r\n\r\nAs close to eight o’clock as possible green food is fed to all the\r\nhens, and, if the ground is in a reasonably dry condition, the green\r\nfood for the cockerels is scattered outside their pen, and the entire\r\nflock is driven out of the House, where they are soon busy consuming\r\nthe green food and whatever grain may have been left on the ground from\r\ntheir outdoor feeding of the previous day.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years it was the method at The Corning Egg Farm,\r\nbetween the hours of nine and ten o’clock, to make a gathering of\r\neggs. This has now been abandoned for the reason that so many birds\r\nwere disturbed on the nests during such an early visit to the House\r\nfor gathering, and the first gathering now on the Farm is made at\r\neleven-thirty.\r\n\r\nIn the study of feeding, extending over a term of years, it has been\r\nfound that a considerable economy in time can be made, with exactly as\r\nadvantageous results from the layers, by the following routine. Fresh\r\nwater is placed in all the laying and breeding pens at one o’clock,\r\nP.M., and it is boiling water during the Winter months. Directly\r\nfollowing the watering the mash is placed in the troughs, and the grain\r\nration is scattered through the litter, both in Summer and Winter.\r\nIt has been found that the hens work just as hard, and continue to\r\ndo so, as they did when the mash and grain fed were given at hours\r\nwhich practically followed the Sun, that is, earlier in Winter, and\r\nlater in Summer. In past years, the oats were fed to the flocks as a\r\nseparate ration, at eleven-thirty o’clock. This we have discontinued.\r\nThe grain ration is made up of cracked corn, wheat and oats, in varying\r\nproportions according to the season of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF THE OLD INCUBATOR CELLAR\r\n\r\nThe New Building with the 15,600 Egg Machines was not Sufficiently\r\nCompleted for Interior Photograph]\r\n\r\n\r\nFour Collections of Eggs Daily\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock another collection of eggs is made, and at five\r\no’clock eggs are again collected, and at this last collection all the\r\ncorners of the litter under the dropping boards are carefully searched\r\nfor eggs laid by the wayward Biddy, who prefers her own scooped out\r\ncorner to a good nest.\r\n\r\nThe Houses are closed for the night, according to the condition of the\r\nweather, and at this time still another collection of eggs is made. At\r\nseven-thirty the Houses are again visited, and all birds not roosting\r\nas they should be are removed from the nest boxes or windows and placed\r\nupon the perches.\r\n\r\n\r\nMash Fed in Afternoon\r\n\r\nDuring the Summer months, when the birds are on Range, they are fed\r\ntheir mash and grain ration between the hours of two and three in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year nothing whatever is allowed to interfere with the\r\nSchedule, and, if one would succeed with poultry a rigid adherence to\r\nregularity is most necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nIncubation on the Corning Egg Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find, in studying Artificial Incubation, it has been in vogue, one\r\nmight almost say, for centuries. The Chinese practiced artificial\r\nincubation by the use of hot sand and ovens, for it must be remembered\r\nthat the Pekin Duck, which comes from China, is a non-setter.\r\nTherefore, ages ago, the Chinese were driven to the necessity of\r\nartificial incubation in order to maintain their large flocks of ducks.\r\nIn studying the art one cannot help wondering that the progress in its\r\ndevelopment has been so slow, and the advance, year by year, has been\r\nalmost nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHen Reigns Supreme\r\n\r\nThe Owners of The Corning Egg Farm were somewhat taken aback one\r\nday by the statement of a young man that he must evolve a theory of\r\nincubation for himself, and carefully carry it out. In incubation one\r\ndoes not want theory, but the knowledge which comes from long practice\r\nand the most scientific study of the art. After all these years, the\r\nhen, as a hatcher, reigns supreme. There is nothing which approximates\r\nher ability to turn out strong, vigorous chicks, and yet it is\r\nunfortunately necessary to abandon the hen when large numbers of chicks\r\nare to be produced. So Man has struggled in his vain efforts to reach\r\nsomething which will, at least in a measure, become a competitor of the\r\nhen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLivable Chicks--Not Numbers\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the readers of advertisements in the Poultry Magazines were\r\nconfronted with the statement that a certain incubator was the only\r\ncompetitor the hen had. But, it is sad to state, there must have been\r\nsome mistake, for this incubator could not live up to the claim in the\r\nadvertisement, nor, so far as it is known, is there any incubator which\r\napproximates that claim. Some marvelous hatches are written of, but the\r\nquestion is not one of marvelous hatches, so far as it means the number\r\nof chicks which manage to come through the strenuous act of exclusion,\r\nbut the real question of incubation is as to the number of strong\r\nchicks, capable of living and growing into an animal which will become\r\na money maker for the man who hatched and raised it.\r\n\r\nMany people stand in great awe of an incubator, no matter what its\r\nmake, and have the feeling that to hatch a fair number of chicks in a\r\nmachine is almost a miracle. The fact is, however, if the purchaser\r\nof any incubator will realize that the manufacturer knows more\r\nabout the proper way to run it than Tom Jones, or Bill Smith, who\r\nmay be neighbors, and will follow the instructions as given by the\r\nmanufacturer, with good fertile eggs, it will be almost a miracle if he\r\ndoes not get at least a fair hatch.\r\n\r\nThere are so many different makes of machines it is quite impossible to\r\nwrite a chapter on incubation which will cover the needs of all phases\r\nof it. The above advice, however, if followed, will certainly be more\r\napt to bring about successful hatches than anything else that can be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm the problem of incubation has been most\r\ncarefully studied from the inception of the Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniform Temperature Most Important\r\n\r\nA thermostat and regulator which will absolutely insure an even\r\ntemperature in the egg chamber, and a thermostat so sensitive, with an\r\nadjustment of the regulator to such a nicety, that it will insure the\r\nmaintaining of an equal temperature in the egg chamber even if there is\r\na variation of atmosphere in the Cellar of from 10 to 20 degrees, is\r\nperhaps, the first great essential in incubation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVentilation and Moisture Next\r\n\r\nVentilation and the retention of moisture undoubtedly come next. The\r\ngrowing embryo must be fed a large quantity of oxygen, and there must\r\nbe a sufficient amount of moisture to prevent a too rapid drying out\r\nof the egg, under the temperature which, if a chick is to result,\r\nmust be maintained. So far as moisture goes, it is not a question of\r\nmoisture at the time of hatching. If the proper amount of moisture has\r\nbeen always present during the period of incubation there will be no\r\ndifficulty at the time of exclusion.\r\n\r\nWhere a large amount of incubation is going on, and the ordinary style\r\nof lamp heated machine is being used, oxygen is of necessity constantly\r\nabsorbed from the atmosphere, by the fire. While it is quite possible,\r\nnay, even probable, that any of the mammoth machines of the day are far\r\nfrom what might be desired, still, they do solve the difficulty of a\r\ngreat number of individual fires sucking the vital oxygen.\r\n\r\nOf the mammoth machines now on the market there are two which produce\r\nbetter chicks than any of the others, so far as we can see. There are\r\nfeatures in the one which we finally decided upon, which, from our\r\npoint of view, made it more desirable than the other. We feel, however,\r\nthat in the construction of these machines there is much to be desired,\r\nand we suggest to any would-be purchasers to make most thorough and\r\ncomplete stipulations with any company from whom they purchase, as to\r\nthe workmanship and finish of the machine, and also the proper fitting\r\nof one part to another, especially the proper working of doors and egg\r\ntrays through all the different periods of incubation. All trays should\r\nbe absolutely interchangeable, and there should be a sufficient amount\r\nof play in the runs, so that, with the swelling of the wood from the\r\nmoisture, there would never be a possibility of their binding. While\r\nthe doors should shut air-tight, their dove-tailed joints should so fit\r\nas to allow their coming away without a particle of stick, or jar, to\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHot Water Machines Best\r\n\r\nWhen it had been fully determined by The Corning Egg Farm to put in\r\nHot Water Heated Incubators, the capacity desired being about sixteen\r\nthousand eggs, it was concluded to divide this capacity between two\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided to build an entirely new Incubator Cellar, and\r\nthe dimensions were 146 feet long by 22 feet wide, 7 feet from the\r\nconcrete floor to the bottom of the floor joists, these latter being\r\n12 inches in width, making a full height to the floor of the Brooder\r\nHouse overhead, 8 feet. The floor joists on the under side of the\r\nfloor of the Brooder House are planed and painted white. The Cellar\r\nis constructed of concrete blocks, made rock faced, and showing in\r\nthe interior of the Cellar. The two incubators are also painted white\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nSo as to eliminate any question of the consumption of oxygen by fire\r\nin the Cellar the heaters are placed with a concrete block partition\r\nbetween them and the incubators, the hot water pipes passing through\r\nthis concrete wall, and connecting with the incubators.\r\n\r\nIn this separate part of the Cellar, where the heaters for the\r\nincubators stand, are also the two heaters for the Brooding System,\r\nupstairs, and also the large auxiliary heater which cares for the\r\nhot-water system which allows the Brooder House to be carried at an\r\neven temperature, day and night.\r\n\r\nIn the heater part of the Cellar there are three large windows, and an\r\nentrance is made into this Cellar through a vestibule which is ten by\r\nnine feet. The doors leading into this are large, double, glass doors,\r\nand from the landing just inside there is a staircase leading to the\r\nBrooder House, above. Entrance is made into the Heater Cellar through\r\nanother pair of glass doors, five feet wide. The Incubator Cellar\r\nitself is reached directly in the center by a four foot door, also of\r\nglass. The two side alleys between the incubators and the outer walls,\r\nare also reached from the Heater Cellar by narrow, glass doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Incubator Cellar Unequaled\r\n\r\nIt is believed this Cellar, with its plan of equipment, is unequaled,\r\nanywhere, as to the convenience of its general arrangement. Ample light\r\nand ventilation are supplied in the Incubation Cellar proper, by twelve\r\nwindows on the north and east sides, the south wall being blank, as the\r\nchick runs from the Brooder House go out on that side.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, owing to the necessity of the narrow alleys between\r\nthe incubators and the walls, to use the V-shaped window drops, which\r\nhave been so successful on the Farm for the prevention of draughts.\r\nThe windows work on sash-weights, both top and bottom. A Spring Roller\r\nShade device, covered with sheer muslin, with a screw eye on the window\r\nsill, is so placed that the cord may be passed through it, holding the\r\nshade rigid. Thus, when the prevailing wind creates a draught, the\r\nwindow may be opened to any desired width, and the draught prevented by\r\nthe shade.\r\n\r\nIn operating the incubators they are run empty for a sufficient number\r\nof hours to adjust the regulator, and to know they will maintain a\r\ntemperature of 103 degrees exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEggs Turned from Third to Eighteenth Day\r\n\r\nAfter eggs are placed in the incubators the process of turning does\r\nnot begin until the third day, after which they are turned regularly\r\ntwice a day until the completion of the 18th day, when they are left\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n103 Degrees Maintained\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which the incubators are carried for the first week\r\nis a matter of wide difference of opinion. In many cases 102 degrees\r\nis the maximum temperature for the first seven days, after which 103\r\nis maintained as closely as possible during the remaining period of\r\nincubation. In operating the incubators on The Corning Egg Farm it has\r\nbeen found (and this is particularly true of early hatches) that,\r\nif the eggs are not brought up to 103 degrees for the first week, a\r\nretarded hatch is the result. A hatch which drags over its time usually\r\nmeans a lot of weaklings. It is our practice, therefore, to bring the\r\neggs up to 103 degrees as soon as possible after setting them, and to\r\ncontinue this temperature as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCool But Never Cold\r\n\r\nCooling the eggs is of course practiced on The Corning Egg Farm. For\r\nthe first week, five or six minutes will usually be found a sufficient\r\ntime, but as the embryo grows the length of time should be increased.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to give any exact length of period for cooling,\r\nand it must be determined by the feel of the egg to the hand. They\r\nshould never reach a point where they can be termed perfectly cold, but\r\nshould feel slightly warm as the palm of the hand is laid upon them.\r\nIn cooling, the egg tray should be placed on top of an incubator or\r\ntable so that the bottom is completely protected, otherwise the eggs\r\nwill cool too rapidly. In other words they should lie as they do in the\r\nnest of the hen. According to atmospheric conditions, cooling, during\r\nthe latter part of incubation, will sometimes reach from forty to sixty\r\nminutes. It is a practice with us to give the eggs a very long period\r\nof cooling on the 18th day, before they are placed in the incubator for\r\nthe last time.\r\n\r\nAfter closing the incubator on the 18th day it is not opened again\r\nuntil the chicks are removed on the 22d day.\r\n\r\nTo open the door and reach in to assist some chick out of difficulty\r\nmeans allowing the moisture to escape, and, while the one individual\r\nwhich was seen to be in trouble might be rescued, by the lack of\r\nmoisture in the egg chamber, many others would be held fast in the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCover Glass Doors\r\n\r\nWhen the chicks begin to hatch we make it a practice to throw a cloth\r\nover the glass door, so as to prevent the youngsters crowding toward\r\nthe light, and piling up on top of each other, either in the egg trays\r\nor in the nurseries below.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Good Chicks Hatch in 20 Days\r\n\r\nMany people have an erroneous idea in regard to the time required for\r\nhatching. If the temperature has been carried at a correct point during\r\nthe entire period the eggs will begin to pip on the afternoon of the\r\n19th day, and the morning of the 20th day should find the youngsters\r\ncoming out of the shells like Pop Corn over a hot fire if the eggs have\r\nbeen of proper strength, but on the morning of the 21st day the hatch\r\nshould be completed. Generally speaking, chicks which hatch later than\r\nthe 21st day are weak, and while they may come along for a time, when\r\nplaced in the Brooder House they generally snuff out, and add to the\r\nlist of mortalities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSet Incubators Toward Evening\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that there is a best time in the twenty-four hours in\r\nwhich to set an incubator. As a rule, it requires about eight hours\r\nafter the eggs have been placed in the machine for it to come up to\r\ntemperature. Therefore, if the eggs go into the chamber late in the\r\nafternoon, and anything goes wrong with the regulator, the eggs cannot\r\nhave been in a detrimental temperature for any great length of time\r\nbefore the operator is making his first morning round. We observe\r\nthe temperature in the egg chamber three times a day as a rule, the\r\nfirst thing in the morning before the eggs are turned; at noon, or a\r\nsufficient number of hours after turning and cooling the eggs, allowing\r\na sufficient time to elapse for coming up to temperature; and again\r\nlate in the afternoon, before the final turning for the day. At these\r\nhours of observation any slight alteration of regulator, to meet\r\nchanges noted in the temperature, is, of course made.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Water, Coal-Heated, Incubator is a great step in advance, and\r\nthese machines are now built in sizes from twelve hundred eggs up.\r\n\r\nWith the old style lamp machine, people who were running a small plant\r\ndid not need an Incubator Cellar, but the Insurance Companies would not\r\nallow the placing of an incubator in the cellar of a house without\r\na special permit, and in many cases would not issue such a permit at\r\nall. The hot water machine will, of course, go into any cellar without\r\nvitiating the insurance, and, what is more, the machine itself is\r\ninsurable, just as is any hot water plant in a house.\r\n\r\n\r\nTested Only on Eighteenth Day\r\n\r\nUntil this season, on The Corning Egg Farm, we had made it a rule to\r\ntest the eggs on the 14th day. Many operators believe in testing the\r\neggs from the 5th to the 7th day, again on the 14th, with the final\r\ntest on the 18th day. In operating one of the old style machines, with\r\nthe large trays, it was expedient to remove the clear eggs and those\r\nwith dead germs to facilitate the turning of the eggs in the trays,\r\nbut all this arduous labor is done away with in the hot water machine.\r\nThe trays hold seventy-five eggs, and are so constructed that one tray\r\nfits on top of another, and then the trays are simply reversed and the\r\nturning is accomplished. This makes it necessary to have a full tray\r\nto prevent the eggs rolling and breaking when they are turned in the\r\nmanner described. Testing the eggs is, therefore, deferred until the\r\n18th day.\r\n\r\nWhen one sees the tremendous saving of time which the coal-heated, hot\r\nwater machine accomplishes for the operator, it produces a feeling\r\nbordering on mirth in the man who has labored with the old style\r\nmachine and big tray, when thousands of eggs were turned by hand twice\r\na day. Ten thousand eggs in one of the modern machines are handled with\r\nless effort and in less time than three thousand could possibly be\r\ncared for in one of the other styles of incubator.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoisture\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm moisture is provided in the Cellar by\r\nthoroughly wetting the floor with a hose twice a day, the floor sloping\r\ngently to a drain in one corner. Large earthen-ware vessels, of about\r\nthree inches in depth and eighteen inches in diameter, are stood\r\nat different points throughout the Cellar, and are constantly kept\r\nfilled with fresh water. This is done, not so much for the purpose of\r\nincreasing the humidity of the air, as it is to take up the impurities.\r\nAs an illustration, if you stand vessels filled with water in a freshly\r\npainted room, the odor of paint is almost entirely absorbed by the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs even a temperature as possible is carried in the Cellar, and at all\r\ntimes there is a constant flow of fresh air, but it is so controlled\r\nthat it does not produce a draught. It should be remembered that while\r\na moist cellar is desirable, unless it is well ventilated, it is\r\nutterly unfit for the purpose of incubation.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicks Handled Only Once\r\n\r\nThe chicks, at the end of the 22d day, are counted out of the incubator\r\ninto large baskets lined with Canton Flannel, and in these they are\r\ncarried upstairs to the Brooder House.\r\n\r\nThe last act of the chicken, before pipping the shell, is to absorb\r\ninto its system the yolk of the egg, which supplies it with a\r\nsufficient amount of nourishment to last at least forty-eight hours.\r\nThis supply of nourishment is what really makes possible the tremendous\r\nbusiness carried on in “baby chicks.” But, as The Corning Egg Farm\r\nviews it, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals should step\r\nin and stop this business. After exclusion is accomplished the chick\r\nis thoroughly exhausted, and for a number of hours, if left to its own\r\ndevices, it lies in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaby Chick Business Cruel\r\n\r\nConsider then the torture that this small animal is put through when it\r\nis taken out of the warm egg chamber, or nursery, as soon as it is dry\r\nenough, packed like a sardine in a box, and then hustled to an express\r\noffice, placed on a train, and, by the swaying of the train, kept in\r\nconstant motion.\r\n\r\nThe sellers of day old chicks in many cases guarantee the arrival of\r\nthe small “puff ball” alive. Unless the distance is extreme this is not\r\nsuch a difficult feat. They are alive on arrival, and perhaps continue\r\nto live in apparently fair strength for some days, but somewhere\r\nbetween the 7th and 10th days the mortality usually runs into such\r\nnumbers that the purchaser finds the remaining number of youngsters\r\nhas cost him about a dollar apiece. As the season advances many more of\r\nthem drop off, one by one, from causes which, to the unsophisticated,\r\nare unknown.\r\n\r\nA short time ago a gentleman who has been engaged in the Baby Chick\r\nbusiness for a number of years was making a call at The Corning Egg\r\nFarm, and expressed his regret at having placed an order with a breeder\r\nof White Rocks for eggs at too late a date to insure their delivery\r\nbefore the first day of May. The breeder, however, had offered him some\r\nday old chicks. Our amusement was considerable when he remarked that he\r\nwould not accept a day old chick as a gift if he was expected to pay\r\nthe expressage.\r\n\r\nThe man who expects to procure strong, healthy youngsters would much\r\nbetter place his money in eggs for hatching, from reliable breeders,\r\nthan to make himself a party to the suffering of these helpless mites.\r\n\r\nIf the humane side of the argument does not appeal to him, certainly\r\nthe money expended will.\r\n\r\nCorrect records, on cards designed by us for the purpose, are kept on\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm, showing the results from the incubators. These\r\nare filed, giving the Farm a record which, as the years go by, becomes\r\ninvaluable, when planning for a year’s work in incubation.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+    +-----------------+\r\n  | INCUBATOR NO.   |    |HOVER NO.        |\r\n  +-----------------+    +-----------------+\r\n  |Set   P.

Its total length is 264 feet. 118 feet of this is 16\r\nfeet wide, and the balance is 22 feet wide.\r\n\r\nIncubation might be termed a mechanical operation, and, as outlined in\r\nthe previous chapter, a very fair hatch is usually obtained. But after\r\nall is said and done artificial rearing of young chicks is the most\r\ndifficult problem which a poultryman has to solve.\r\n\r\nChicks running with a hen will stand climatic conditions, and in fact\r\nthrive under conditions, which, if they were being handled in a Brooder\r\nHouse, would mean a tremendous mortality. The hen will feed her brood\r\non substances which would mean the annihilation of ones’ entire flock\r\nof youngsters, should one attempt it, and, perhaps, the most curious\r\nfeature of the feeding part is the fact that one may give the brood,\r\nrunning with the hen, food Nature never intended a small chick to eat,\r\nand many of the brood will thrive on it, and the mortality will, in\r\nmost cases, be confined to the weak ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorn Not Proper Chick Food\r\n\r\nIn past decades, wet corn meal seemed to be about the standard ration\r\nwhich the chicks were fed on by the farmer’s wife, and in fact this\r\npractice has not yet entirely gone out. Naturally, it brought about a\r\nlarge mortality which everyone deplored but could not understand. Corn\r\nin any form was never intended for a chick to eat, but when you place\r\nit before them in the form of meal, and this made into a sloppy mass,\r\nthe wonder is, not at the largeness of the mortality, but rather that\r\nany of them live at all.\r\n\r\nBut the advance in Poultry Culture has brought about feeding of whole\r\ngrains, to a large extent. For years the proper feeding of chicks,\r\neven on farms with modern brooding equipment, has been a stumbling\r\nblock, causing serious loss, and, in many instances, failure, to those\r\nattempting to raise chickens either in large or small numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow Nature’s Teaching\r\n\r\nIn Poultry Culture, in order to succeed it is essential to study\r\nNature, to find out how the hen in a wild state cares for her brood,\r\nand then bring the artificial conditions as near to Nature as possible.\r\nIn almost every chick food put on the market the main ingredient,\r\nnamely corn, was never intended for a young chick to eat. Consider for\r\na moment, and you will realize that the hen in a wild state could not\r\npossibly feed corn to her young. For the sake of argument, however,\r\nsuppose that corn did ripen at a time when it would be possible for the\r\nhen to procure it for her brood, the size of the kernel is so great\r\nthat the small chick could not possibly swallow it. Thus Nature plainly\r\npoints out that corn, for young chicks, is not the proper food.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Balanced Food\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm the question of chick food that could properly\r\nbe called “chick food” has been a study for years, the problem being\r\nto procure a balanced ration containing, as closely as possible, the\r\ningredients intended by Nature for a young chick to eat and thrive on.\r\nMany experiments were made with different mixtures, both with chicks\r\nrunning with natural mothers and with those being reared in the Brooder\r\nHouse, and it was found that in all cases where corn was fed in the\r\nmixture the results were bad. The youngsters running with the hen did\r\nnot show the large mortality which those did in the Brooder House, but\r\neven the broods running with the hen did not do nearly so well where\r\nthe corn was fed, as did those not having this ingredient in their food.\r\n\r\nThe great mortality in young chicks is produced by the upsetting\r\nof their digestive organs. Corn is very heating, and as soon as\r\nthe chick’s blood is over-heated its digestive organs fail to work\r\nproperly, and what is now known as “White Diarrhœa” almost invariably\r\ndevelops. It is claimed by some authorities that this difficulty comes\r\nfrom a germ which is in the egg before incubation. This may be the\r\ncase, but it is certainly true that wrong feeding will bring this germ\r\ninto active life, and snuff out the existence of the chick.\r\n\r\nAnother phase, which has been a special study on The Corning Egg Farm\r\nin the brooding of chicks, is an abundant supply of fresh air, not\r\nonly in the room itself, but also to have the oxygen fed to the chicks\r\nproperly when they are under the hovers. The use of gas for heating the\r\nhovers was found a decided improvement over the lamp, so far as the\r\nfreshness of the air went, but, for procuring the purest hot air, to\r\nflow up into the hovers, we are now installing a system of hot water\r\npipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ARRANGEMENT OF BROODER HOUSE\r\n\r\nNew House not Completed in Time for Photographing]\r\n\r\nIn a dwelling house, properly constructed, the entire heating apparatus\r\nis a hot air furnace, with a cold air box connected with outdoors\r\nconstantly bringing in a fresh supply of pure air to be heated. If it\r\nwere possible this would be the ideal way of supplying the heat to\r\nthe hover, but of course in a long Brooder House it is impossible to\r\ndo this. The nearest approach to this system of heating is a trunk\r\nline of hot water pipes, extending beneath the hover floor, with the\r\npipes enclosed in a long box, standing some two inches from the floor,\r\nand with orifices of proper size to allow the fresh air to circulate\r\naround the pipes, and then, through the radiating devices, to flow out\r\nunderneath the hover, and thus to be diffused over the backs of the\r\nchicks. On The Corning Egg Farm this box is constructed of galvanized\r\niron, and covered on the top and sides with asbestos board, with an\r\nair space between the asbestos board and the hover floor. Through this\r\nfloor comes a thimble which connects with the radiator above. The top\r\nof this radiator is a spiral screw, which works like a piano stool\r\nreversed, and with a tripod device which carries the thread but allows\r\nthe hover itself to be removed without changing its position on the\r\nscrew. As the chicks grow the hover can be slowly raised away from\r\nthem, until it is finally removed entirely, and the chicks learn to do\r\nwithout it for a considerable time before they are moved to the Colony\r\nRange. The thimble is most thoroughly insulated with asbestos, so that\r\nthere is no possibility of the much dreaded heat on the hover floor,\r\nwhich, when it does exist, tends to dry up the chicks’ legs.\r\n\r\nFrom the hover floor there is an inclined runway down to the main floor\r\nof the Brooder House, which is covered with a fine litter, preferably\r\nshort cut wheat straw, to a depth of about two inches.\r\n\r\nThe inclined runway is hinged to the hover floor and works with a\r\ncord passing through a pulley on the ceiling, enabling the operator\r\nto raise it and retain the chicks directly around the hover. The\r\ntrough surrounding the trunk line of hot water pipes is closed by a\r\npartition corresponding to the width of the hover run, which prevents\r\nthe heat from flowing by the radiator in each section, and in this way\r\nequalizing the heat in every hover.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever Build a Double House\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm is much opposed to what is known as the Double\r\nBrooder House, which is advocated by many builders of Brooder\r\nHouse equipments, and, in which, in the majority of cases, the\r\nuse of concrete floors is also practiced. The advantages in the\r\nsupposed economy of this construction are more than off-set by the\r\ndisadvantages. The proper place for the windows of the Brooder House is\r\non the south front, and likewise the south side of the building is the\r\nproper place for the chick runs. The roof should be a shed roof sloping\r\nto the north, thus carrying all the water to the back and allowing none\r\nof it to drip down into the runs. The north side of the Brooder House\r\nshould be absolutely tight, for, from this quarter, comes the great\r\nmajority of cold storms, and the tight wall means an economy in fuel.\r\nAnd every item of expense must be carefully watched on a poultry farm.\r\n\r\nIn these different respects let us look at the double house. First, it\r\nmust run north and south; second, it must have windows on the east and\r\nwest, and the chick runs must go the same way; third, it must be built\r\nwith a peaked roof, the drippings from storms thus falling directly\r\ninto the yards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMust Drain Chick Runs\r\n\r\nIn the Corning plan of Brooder House the yards are sloped toward the\r\nsouth, and, as there is no possibility of dripping from the roof, in a\r\nfew moments after a hard storm the slope and the sun combined put the\r\nyards at once into a usable condition, so that the youngsters can be\r\nlet out. All day long in this style Brooder House the yellow babies\r\nenjoy the sunshine. In the double constructed Brooder House the yards\r\nare bathed on the east side with sunshine for a short time, and the\r\nwest side receives the Sun for a few hours before sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete Floors Mean Dampness\r\n\r\nAn added menace in this double style of construction is the concrete\r\nfloor generally used. It is almost impossible, with the greatest\r\ncare and forethought, to produce a piece of concrete which does\r\nnot constantly take up and give off moisture, and one thing to be\r\nabsolutely avoided in poultry houses, little or big, is dampness.\r\n\r\nThe dollars saved in the construction of double houses are usually\r\ndollars which would have been made ten times over by the expenditure\r\nnecessary to build a proper house.\r\n\r\nThe chick yards on The Corning Egg Farm are sloping, and are twenty\r\nfeet long, and correspond in width with the hover runs inside the\r\nhouse, which vary from three to four feet in width. The diameter of\r\nthe hover varies with the size of the run, from 26 to 30 inches. The\r\nsloping runs of the Brooder yards are covered with Anthracite Coal\r\nashes, which have been found to entirely eliminate the much talked of\r\ndanger of contamination of soil, the surface being constantly renewed\r\nas the ashes are consumed by the chicks.\r\n\r\nEach hover is numbered, and directly back, on the north wall of the\r\nBrooder House, is a corresponding number, and a nail, on which is hung\r\nthe record card. When the chicks are carried up in baskets from the\r\nIncubator Cellar, they are carefully examined, all weaklings being\r\nexcluded, and counted into the hover compartments. Careful selection\r\nand the “survival of the fittest” begin at this point with the stock on\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the number of chicks carried in the hover\r\ncompartments, it must be understood that running along the north\r\nwall of the Brooder House is a coil of hot water pipes, capable of\r\nmaintaining a temperature of 85 degrees, three feet from the floor, and\r\nin zero weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Heated Brooder House\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm believes absolutely in Brooder Houses heated\r\nbeyond what is supplied by the hovers, and this is the reason it is\r\npossible to carry such a large number of youngsters in each hover\r\ncompartment. In large hatches, when we have been crowded for room, two\r\nhundred chicks have frequently been carried in one compartment of four\r\nfeet in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHICKS SIX WEEKS OLD IN BROODER HOUSE RUNS]\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Feeds Dry Food Only\r\n\r\nWhen the chicks are first placed in the hover compartment the inclined\r\nplane is drawn up and they find two drinking cups ready--the style that\r\nfeeds itself into a small cup, into which it is not possible for the\r\nyoungsters to get. They also find waiting for them their first meal of\r\nCorning Chick Food. For the first twenty-four hours the inclined plane\r\nremains up, and the hovers are visited every two hours. If the amount\r\nof Chick Food has been well cleaned up, another feeding is evenly\r\ndistributed over the boards. It must be understood that litter is never\r\nplaced on the hover floor, though it is kept two inches deep on the\r\nfloor of the pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Feeds Daily\r\n\r\nThe following morning the inclined plane is let down, about five\r\nhandfuls of Corning Chick Food to every hundred chicks is thrown into\r\nthe litter, and a little is scattered just at the top of the inclined\r\nplane to entice the youngsters down. No more food is given until the\r\nnoon hour, when, into the litter is thrown two handfuls to every\r\nhundred chicks, and again a small quantity is placed at the top. No\r\nmore feeding is done until four o’clock when five handfuls of Corning\r\nChick Food are again thrown into the litter.\r\n\r\nFor the first two or three nights, or more if necessary, the chicks are\r\nquietly driven up to the hover, and the inclined plane pulled up after\r\nthem, it being let down the first thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nFresh water is supplied in the drinking cups each day, morning, noon,\r\nand night, and, with the night filling, a brush on the plan of those\r\nmade for the cleansing of milk bottles, is used to give the cups a\r\nproper cleaning.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the record cards, hung behind each hover, the mortality\r\nis kept.\r\n\r\nThe hovers are raised every morning to learn the exact condition of the\r\nentire brood after the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Food Third Day\r\n\r\nOn the third day green food is added to the ration, in the form of the\r\ntops of Sprouted Oats. Never feed the rooty mass to the youngsters for\r\nit is almost sure to upset them. The smallest chick has no difficulty\r\nbreaking up and getting away with Oat Sprouts from one and a half to\r\ntwo inches long, and there is nothing they like so well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal Food Tenth Day\r\n\r\nThe regular ration is continued with judgment, for in feeding it is to\r\nbe remembered that judgment must be exercised at all times. After the\r\ntenth day animal food is added to the ration, commencing with a small\r\nhandful of The Corning Egg Farm Mash, thrown on top of the litter.\r\nWhere beef scraps are used to supply the animal food they may be fed\r\nalone, and this was done at first on The Corning Egg Farm, but for\r\nthe last three years we have fed the green bone in the mash mixture.\r\nIt, however, must be fed with great care, and the bone used for this\r\npurpose must be most carefully selected, and must be absolutely fresh.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that even one or two ham bones, or corned beef\r\nbones mixed in the ration would mean the loss of a great many chicks.\r\nShank bones and briskets, when obtainable, are ideal for this purpose,\r\nand during the Brooding season these are selected out and kept for what\r\nis termed the “baby’s mash.” With the introduction on the tenth day of\r\nthe Mash, the noon-day feeding of Corning Chick Food is discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy the time the youngsters are four weeks old the hovers have been\r\nremoved entirely, and one finds that the little fellows will lie very\r\ncontentedly, spread out on the floor, so long as the temperature in the\r\nBrooder House is kept up to 85° three feet above the floor, as before\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvoid Moving Chicks Often\r\n\r\nThe removal of the chicks from the hover runs into the nurseries,\r\nas formerly practiced on The Corning Egg Farm, has been entirely\r\ndiscontinued. A chick in many respects resembles a flower; every time\r\nit is moved or transplanted it receives a certain setback. For this\r\nreason the great Brooder House has all been turned into hover runs, and\r\nthe chicks make one move from the Brooder House to the Colony House.\r\nA moving generally represents not only a slight setback, but some\r\nmortality through accident and the change itself.\r\n\r\nThe small chick doors into the outside runs are opened, if the weather\r\nis propitious, about the fifth or sixth day in the early part of the\r\nhatching season, and on the third or fourth day later on. The chicks\r\nare never driven into the yard, any more than they are driven down the\r\ninclined plane, but it is always our method to allow the youngsters\r\nto seek a new field for themselves, and slowly. When they go out into\r\nthe yard they are watched, and if there is any inclination to huddle\r\nup against the warm side of the building they are driven back into the\r\nBrooder House.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage of the heated Brooder House (and we speak of\r\nthis as entirely separate from the heat under the hovers) is that it\r\nallows the chick to seek different degrees of temperature. There is one\r\ntemperature under the hover; another temperature outside of the hover,\r\non the hover floor; still another degree on the main floor of the\r\nBrooder House; and, then, there is the outdoor temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen the chicks are first placed under the hovers, during the first\r\nday, we carry the temperature at 95 degrees, and then slowly decrease\r\nthis by raising the hover. Where an adjustable hover is not used this\r\nmay be accomplished by turning down the lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nHandling Birds on Range--The Youngsters Must Be Kept Growing All the\r\nTime\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birds leave the Brooder House for their permanent Summer home on\r\nthe Colony Range, so far as the pullets in the flock go, at eight to\r\nnine weeks of age.\r\n\r\nThe Colony Houses are prepared for the new tenants by being thoroughly\r\nsprayed with a solution of Kerosene and Carbolic Acid, in a proportion\r\nof one to five--one Carbolic and five Kerosene. Before spraying, the\r\ncanvas drops to the windows are let down, and after spraying the House\r\nis left twenty-four hours in a perfectly closed condition, before the\r\ndrops are raised. The floor is then covered with straw litter to the\r\ndepth of four inches; the five gallon drinking fountain is filled\r\nand placed on its stand close to the door; the feed box receives its\r\nquantity of mash, and the grain is scattered over the litter.\r\n\r\nWe practice the filling of from six to eight Colony Houses at a time,\r\nand with this coming season of 1912 we shall increase that number to\r\nten.\r\n\r\nThe Colony Houses are raised about eight inches from the ground, by\r\nblocks, and, as it is not advisable for the small birds to get under\r\nthe House for the first few days, we have sets of boards which fit\r\naround the House to prevent their making the mistake of huddling under\r\nthe House at night, instead of going up into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Corning Wrinkle\r\n\r\nAnother preparation, on the outside of the House, is the digging of a\r\nditch, in the shape of a crescent, about two feet back of the House,\r\nthe ditch tapering out to nothing at the two ends, the dirt being\r\nthrown to the side away from the Colony House. All houses face due\r\nsouth. The heavy storms of the Summer come rushing up, as a general\r\nthing, from the west and northwest, and this ditch, together with the\r\nmound of earth back of it, prevents the rush of wind and rain getting\r\nunder the Colony House, protecting the large number of chicks, that, on\r\noccasion of sudden storm, collect there for shelter. It has been found\r\nthat this materially reduces the mortality resulting from these heavy\r\nSummer showers, accompanied by a strong wind. The ditch also keeps\r\ndampness entirely away from the ground under the Colony Houses, which\r\nis also a very great advantage.\r\n\r\nAll being now ready at the Colony Houses, a large wire cage (the one\r\nnow in use being eight feet long and two and a half feet wide, and\r\neight inches high, with sliding doors at each end, and two soft leather\r\nhandles to carry it by) is placed at the door opening into the chick\r\nruns from the Brooder House, and the youngsters are quietly driven into\r\nthe cage. When a sufficient number to carry safely has been driven in,\r\nthe cage is carried out, placed on the wagon and driven to the Range.\r\nThe birds at this time are from eight to nine weeks old, we having\r\nfound it is better to have a sufficient amount of brooder room to carry\r\nthem to this age before placing on Range, as they are then much better\r\nfeathered, and are less affected by changes of atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen the cages reach the Colony House the sliding door is placed\r\ndirectly in front of the small chick door, and both slides pulled up,\r\nand the chicks gently coaxed, by patting the box on the top and sides,\r\nto leave it for the Colony House. We place in each of these Colony\r\nHouses from two hundred and fifty to three hundred birds of this age.\r\n\r\nAs the cockerels develop they are separated, and those which are\r\nperfect in formation, and as to toes, five pointed combs, etc., and\r\ngive promise of growing into proper Breeders, are placed in the\r\nCockerel House, and given the Range of the large enclosure surrounding\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\nUntil well along in the Summer, when the youngsters are first placed\r\nin the Colony House, we make it a practice to hang, directly in the\r\ncenter of the House and within about three feet of the floor, a large\r\nbarn lantern, and with the window drops closed this produces a very\r\nconsiderable amount of heat, and helps materially to give a feeling of\r\ncomfort and contentment to the birds in their new quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONY RANGE FEED AND WATER WAGON WITH “BILLY” IN THE\r\nSHAFTS]\r\n\r\nThe afternoon following the day in which chicks are put into the Colony\r\nHouses (which means that they have been confined for about twenty-four\r\nhours), they are let out, but not until four o’clock, and they find\r\ntheir grain ration scattered close to the door of the House. In fact,\r\nit is not scattered until the small chick doors are opened for them to\r\ncome out, and then it is thrown on the runs, and through the doors, as\r\nwell as on the ground directly in front. The grain lying in the runways\r\nacts in a double way; it entices them out, and as they see it on the\r\nground they eat very little on the runs, but later, after they have\r\ncleaned up all on the ground, that lying on the chick runs attracts\r\nthem on back into the House at night.\r\n\r\nThe reason for letting the birds out so late in the day for their first\r\nouting is that a chicken, late in the day, will never go any great\r\ndistance from where it has been confined, but works around close to\r\nthe quarters in which it has spent the previous hours, and naturally\r\nreturns there for shelter as the Sun goes down. The following morning\r\nthe chick doors are opened and the birds allowed to roam at will.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrain and Mash Once a Day\r\n\r\nFrom this on the regular routine of Range feeding is followed. The\r\nRange Feed Wagon is low geared and broad tired. On the rear of the\r\nwagon there is a large, square tank, carrying some two hundred gallons\r\nof water. The faucet for drawing the water is placed on the bottom and\r\ncenter of the rear, the tank being placed on the wagon with a slight\r\nincline, and is of inch size so as to facilitate the rapid filling of\r\nthe drinking fountains, which are placed directly underneath it. The\r\nfront part of the wagon carries the tubs of mash and the grain ration.\r\nAs the Colony Houses are laid out symmetrically the broad tires of the\r\nwagon soon wear smooth roads in front of them, and heavy loads are\r\nreadily pulled over the Range streets. The Houses are placed from side\r\nto side about eighty feet apart. From the front of the Houses on one\r\nstreet to the rear of the House on the next street is about one hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe question of shelter on the Range was quite a problem at first, and\r\nto meet it in a measure we set out shelters, which were constructed by\r\nstretching roofing over frames about twelve feet square, and set up\r\nsome two and a half feet on stakes driven into the ground.\r\n\r\nIt had been planned to carry the Colony Range in Timothy and Clover,\r\nbut we lost the catch, and as the ground had been very heavily\r\nfertilized with the litter from the Laying Houses, a very rank and\r\nluxuriant growth of all kinds of Flora sprang up, and we found that\r\nwhat seemed to us a piece of very hard luck in losing the catch, was\r\nreally a blessing in disguise, for this rank growth of Flora, even in\r\nits first year, was of sufficient height to give very considerable\r\nshelter to the large flocks on the Range, and with the Colony Houses\r\njust off the ground, the improvised shelters were practically abandoned\r\nby the birds, and so they have been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlenty of Shade\r\n\r\nWith the yearly scattering of the increased amount of litter as the\r\nFarm enlarged, the growth on the Range is becoming more and more\r\nluxuriant, and now the entire Range has a succession of changing Flora\r\nfrom month to month, and with some varieties, almost from week to week.\r\nThere is a considerable growth of Timothy and Clover, and many other\r\nvarieties of the grass family, which produce a varied diet of succulent\r\nfood, and of course the constant change in Flora also supplies a\r\nvaried diet of seeds which the birds harvest for themselves. Any oats\r\nand wheat which have been missed in the litter from the Laying Houses\r\nsprout here, and the birds also harvest this crop for themselves. The\r\ncondition of the Range under this method of handling, as we view it, is\r\nabsolutely ideal for the growing youngsters.\r\n\r\nFresh water is supplied daily to the Houses, and the grain ration\r\nconsists of two-thirds wheat, and one-third cracked corn. The amount\r\nof grain fed to each Colony House depends upon the cleaning up of it\r\nby the tenants of this particular House. The mash box is filled daily\r\nwith what is now known as the Corning Range Mash, which consists\r\nof wheat middlings, bran, ground oats, corn meal, and a sufficient\r\namount of green bone, when mechanically mixed in a machine which has\r\nbeen designed by the Farm for this purpose, to give the mash a slight\r\nfeeling of moisture, which is derived entirely from the juices of the\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nThere is not so great a proportion of animal food in this Range Mash as\r\nin the mash for the layers, and it should be noticed that there is in\r\nit no gluten or oil meal. The early hatches particularly are not forced\r\nalong quite so rapidly, and are less liable to go into a Winter moult\r\nthan if they get these ingredients, and should they moult it comes at a\r\nlater date and does not extend over so long a period.\r\n\r\nOn such a range it is not necessary to have so great a proportion of\r\nanimal food in the mash, because the floral growth harbors myriads of\r\nworms and insects, which supply a large part of the animal food needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoved to Laying House Middle of September\r\n\r\nIt is now our plan to allow the early hatched pullets to remain on the\r\nRange until the first or second week in September, according to the\r\nweather and the way they are laying.\r\n\r\nThe time has now arrived for taking up the first fifteen hundred\r\npullets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEEDING ON THE COLONY RANGE]\r\n\r\nThe Laying House has been previously prepared for their reception, by\r\nremoving all the old litter, the nest boxes having been scraped and\r\nbrushed out, and the House then thoroughly swept, and all the corners\r\ncleaned out with a scraper, after which, with all the doors and drops\r\nclosed, it is subjected to a most thorough spraying with Kerosene and\r\nCrude Carbolic, in the same proportions given in the earlier part of\r\nthis chapter. This spraying covers every part of the House, and is\r\ndone with a force pump, so that the solution is forced into every nook\r\nand cranny. The House is then bedded down with about eight inches of\r\nfresh straw, the nest boxes made ready with excelsior, and the mash\r\nfor that day placed in the two mash boxes in each section, under the\r\ndropping boards. The grain is scattered in the litter, this being all\r\ndone before the birds are brought to the house, so as to obviate the\r\nnecessity of disturbing them more than is absolutely necessary for the\r\nfirst twenty-four hours in their new quarters.\r\n\r\nThe birds having been left shut up in the Colony Houses, a wire hook is\r\nused to catch them, and a man who is accustomed to using it, standing\r\nat the door, reaches in and easily catches one pullet after another by\r\nthe leg, gently pulls her to the door and hands her out to the man in\r\nwaiting, who drops her quietly into a large box, on the Farm Wagon,\r\nwith an opening, provided with a slide at the top. These boxes are\r\ncarried right into the Laying House, when the entire front slides out,\r\nthus releasing the birds all at once, and any chance of struggling\r\nthrough a small opening and injuring themselves, is done away with.\r\n\r\nThe method used in accustoming the birds in the Colony Houses to get\r\non without artificial heat is as follows: for the first three or four\r\nnights, depending on the coolness of the weather, all canvas drops are\r\ndown, and a large, lighted, stable lantern is hung in the House. For\r\nthe next few nights after the lantern is removed the drops are left\r\nclosed. Then one drop is propped out an inch or two, and from night to\r\nnight the opening is increased, until the drop is left up altogether.\r\nAfter that, for a few nights, one drop is left up and the other closed.\r\nNext, the second drop is slowly worked up in the manner described,\r\nuntil it reaches the height of the hook. After this they are never\r\nlowered again so long as the birds remain on the Range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nFeeding for Eggs--Wholesome Nourishment--Not Destructive Stimulants\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless a hen is properly fed she may have been purchased from the\r\ngreatest strain of layers that it is possible to imagine, and still you\r\nmay have an empty nest so far as eggs go.\r\n\r\nThe food which the hen takes into her system goes first to supply her\r\nbodily wants, the surplus she turns into eggs, and if properly bred she\r\nwill turn that surplus into profit very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy Assimilation\r\n\r\nShe must be fed, then, so as to have what is generally termed a\r\n“balanced ration,” which really means a ration supplying all her\r\ndifferent wants.\r\n\r\nShe must be fed so as to be able to assimilate her food with ease. She\r\nmight be fed a ration which she could easily digest, but the ration\r\nmight not so assimilate and combine as to be an egg maker.\r\n\r\nThe greatest factor in assimilation is proper green food, and the hen\r\nshould have this in a crisp, succulent state, and plenty of it. The egg\r\nbeing to such a large extent formed of water, unless she is supplied\r\nwith all the drinking water she will take, your labor will go for\r\nnaught, and the hen will not be able to lay eggs.\r\n\r\nHer grain ration must be of the best, and it should be fed in such a\r\nway that she is forced to work for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfect Health or No Eggs\r\n\r\nIf Biddy is to lay, she must be kept in perfect health, and without\r\nexercise that is impossible.\r\n\r\nShe must live in a house without draughts but in which the air is\r\nalways fresh by means of perfect ventilation, and she must have\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nHer quarters must be kept clean and sweet, and a good supply of coarse\r\noyster shell, sharp grit, or sifted, hard coal ashes, should be always\r\naccessible in quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbundant Animal Food\r\n\r\nShe must have an abundance of animal food, either in form of green\r\ncut bone, or beef scraps, and this should be mixed as we feed it in\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm Mash, which is a mixture of different meals in\r\nwhich the animal food is thoroughly distributed. Of grain, to one\r\nhundred hens, eight quarts of a mixture of wheat, corn and oats, should\r\nbe given; in Summer, about two-thirds wheat and one-third cracked\r\ncorn, reducing the wheat to a third and increasing the corn to about\r\ntwo-thirds in cold weather, adding to this mixture at all times two\r\nquarts of oats. That is to say, six quarts of wheat and corn and two\r\nquarts of oats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Corning Mash the Secret\r\n\r\nThe amount of Mash fed in the troughs varies in accordance with the way\r\nthe birds clean it up. The point aimed at being to feed in each House\r\nthe quantity that the birds will about clean up, by roosting time. The\r\nintention is that their first food in the morning shall be obtained by\r\ntheir vigorous scratching in the litter. All the grain is fed at one\r\ntime, in the afternoon, and is not forked into the litter, as the birds\r\nhave worked all day up to this time, it is desired that they fill up\r\nrather easily from feeding time till dark. As they move and scratch\r\nthey bury the surplus grain most effectively in the litter, thus saving\r\nconsiderable labor, which is expended on many poultry farms, by using\r\nthe pitch fork to place the grain deep in the straw.\r\n\r\nWhen the pullets are first put into the Laying House, about ten pounds\r\nof Mash is placed in each trough, this being estimated as sufficient\r\nfor each one hundred birds. If it is not cleaned up, the amount, the\r\nnext day, is decreased, but if entirely consumed the quantity is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nOver and over again it is stated in articles that large quantities of\r\nanimal food and rich meals in the mash are very stimulating and wear\r\nthe hen out. This is a great mistake. When the hen is being supplied\r\nwith the proper ingredients for a large egg production she is not being\r\nstimulated, but rather helped and sustained in the natural way.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Egg Foods” Kill Layers\r\n\r\nOn the market, to-day, is found an ever increasing number of\r\npreparations advertised as “egg foods”; “foods” warranted to produce\r\neggs without fail and in record breaking quantities. An analysis of\r\nalmost any of these concoctions discloses the fact that Capsicum, or\r\nin other words red pepper, is the basis of the preparation, or at\r\nleast it is the ingredient in the mixture which is counted upon to\r\nproduce the advertised results, namely, the certain and great output\r\nof eggs. If fed in sufficient quantities to actually stimulate the egg\r\norgans of the hen it must in a short time kill her, but if it should\r\nnot have this effect, it certainly does put her in such a condition\r\nthat she is worthless as a layer. It must be constantly borne in mind\r\nthat the production of eggs is not a question of stimulation, but is\r\nthe putting of the hen into a perfect condition of health, keeping her\r\nin that condition, and supplying her with foods which are egg making\r\nsubstances, and which nourish her completely, and allow a surplus to be\r\nturned into eggs.\r\n\r\nOn The Corning Egg Farm, this plan has always been the line along which\r\nwe have worked, supplying the hen with the natural ingredients from\r\nwhich, in a healthy state, she is able to produce the greatest number\r\nof large, sanitary eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustard Increases Egg Laying\r\n\r\nFor the last three years experiments have been carried on with mustard.\r\nIt had been accidently noticed that table scraps, containing some\r\nof the leavings of a salad where mustard had been used, and which\r\nhad been thrown out to a few barn-yard hens, were greedily devoured.\r\nIt was further observed that, after a few days, the egg production\r\nincreased. Following this interesting discovery, quite an exhaustive\r\ntest was carried on with eighteen hens, running over a period of\r\ntwelve months. The Corning Egg Farm followed this experiment with\r\nconsiderable interest. Six of the hens were fed an ordinary ration;\r\nsix of them were given Red Pepper, and the other half dozen were fed\r\nmustard mixed in their food. At the end of the test all the hens were\r\nkilled and carefully examined. The organs of the six hens which were\r\nfed an ordinary ration were found to be in fair shape, and those fed\r\nred pepper had enlarged livers. The six hens which were fed the mustard\r\nwere found to be in perfect organic condition, and they had been in\r\ngood healthy shape all through the entire twelve months. They had\r\nproduced a considerable percentage of eggs beyond either of the other\r\ntwo pens. As a matter of fact the hens fed on the pepper laid fewer\r\neggs than those fed the ordinary ration.\r\n\r\n  CORNING EGG FARM BOOK\r\n\r\n  SEE PAGE 147 ON MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n  By an error in printing, the paragraph giving the proportions of\r\n  mustard was omitted:\r\n\r\n  If highly concentrated mustard is used, one teaspoonful for every six\r\n  hens. If mustard bran is used, three teaspoonfuls for every six hens.\r\n\r\nNow, the mustard used in this experiment was highly concentrated\r\ntable mustard, and while the cost, where only six hens were being\r\nfed with it, amounted to very little, on a large plant like The\r\nCorning Farm, the question of cost becomes a serious item. Whether to\r\nfeed concentrated mustard or a mustard bran was found to be worthy\r\nof careful consideration, because it was impossible to get nearly\r\nas perfect a mixture in the Mash, with a small quantity of highly\r\nconcentrated mustard, as with a mustard not so strong but running three\r\ntimes the amount in bulk. As an illustration of the advisability of\r\nintroducing the mustard in form of bran we might say that, by using a\r\nsmall quantity of one certain meal carrying a very high percentage of\r\nprotein, it would be possible to introduce into the Mash the amount of\r\nprotein desired, but by using a number of meals, each carrying a small\r\npercentage of protein, a much better Mash results, and every bird is\r\nable to get its due and necessary proportion of the ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustard Increases Fertility\r\n\r\nThe three pens before mentioned, after being fed as described through\r\nthe Winter months, were mated in the month of March, and it was found\r\nthat the fertility of the eggs of the mustard fed pen far exceeded that\r\nof either of the other pens, and that the resulting chicks were much\r\nstronger, developed better, and were altogether more desirable than\r\nthe chicks produced where the birds had been fed merely the ordinary\r\nration, and where the attempt had been made to stimulate the egg\r\nproduction by the use of red pepper.\r\n\r\nThe exact action of mustard, in the animal or human being, is a\r\nsomewhat disputed point, but the Medical Fraternity seems to agree\r\nthat it increases the secretion of gastric juices, and very decidedly\r\npromotes good digestion.\r\n\r\nA great layer must be a large eater, but she cannot be a large eater\r\nunless she is kept in perfect health, and has the necessary appetite\r\nwhich only comes when in a strong, robust, vigorous condition.\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm has fed mustard in a way that it has never been\r\nfed before; the egg production has increased very materially; the\r\npercentage of fertility has run considerably higher; the germs have\r\nbeen strong, large, hatchable germs, and the resulting chicks, have\r\ncome into existence with a jump and, where they have been properly\r\nhandled, have rapidly grown into sturdy youngsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n4,000 Layers Fed Mustard\r\n\r\nWe started to feed our breeding pens with mustard in the Mash just\r\nat the time we desired them to come into eggs, and they responded at\r\nonce. That is to say, after the Mash containing mustard had been fed\r\nto them for about a week, the egg output increased daily, and not only\r\ndid it increase, but the high marks which were reached were steadily\r\nmaintained. Four thousand layers have been fed mustard in their Mash\r\ndaily, and after months of this feeding the flocks have never been in\r\nbetter health, and the egg production has never been equaled even on\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm.\r\n\r\nThe Mustard Bran is about twenty-five per cent. of the cost of table\r\nmustard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustard Maintains Health\r\n\r\nThe experiment with mustard, with the eighteen hens, was carried on\r\nover a term of twelve months. We do not believe, however, that it is\r\nwise to feed mustard to the layers and breeders after June 15th, unless\r\nthe early months of Summer should prove to be exceptionally cool. The\r\nmustard nourishes very strongly and puts an immense amount of red\r\ncorpuscles into the blood, so that if continued into warm weather the\r\nhen is not in best condition to stand extreme Summer heat.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to gradually decrease the mustard, but it may be\r\nsimply cut right out of the Mash without any detrimental effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep Appetite Keen\r\n\r\nThe great thing, then, to be remembered, when one is feeding for eggs\r\nis constant watchfulness of the flock, to so feed that the appetite is\r\nalways keen, but yet the necessities of the bird fully satisfied; to\r\nbe most watchful as to the exercise the bird is forced to take for its\r\ngrain ration, and to keep the litter deep. Right in this connection we\r\nmay say, a deep litter does not necessarily mean one that is so broken\r\nup and packed together that the grain cannot readily sift through it.\r\nThe litter straw should be constantly added to so as to offer a surface\r\nthat the grain will readily sift through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor the past years, in feeding the layers, The Corning Egg Farm Mash\r\nwas prepared on Sundays and fed exactly as on any other day of the\r\nweek. With the increase of the work on the Farm it has been a study to\r\nlighten Sunday labor as much as possible.\r\n\r\nOn investigating the litter around the Mash Boxes there will always\r\nbe found a certain amount of Mash that has been scratched out of\r\nthe troughs, and to a certain extent neglected. The experiment was\r\ntherefore made of omitting the Mash on Sunday, and at once Biddy became\r\nextremely energetic in her efforts to extract from the litter every\r\nparticle of Mash which she had wasted through the week. It is quite\r\npossible that by continuing the Mash ration on Sunday a trifle higher\r\negg average might be maintained throughout the week. When the cost\r\nof feeding is figured in, however, it is found that there is a real\r\nsaving in discontinuing the Mash for one day. The plan has now been in\r\noperation for over eight months, and there is no reason, so far as can\r\nbe seen, why the old method of preparing the Mash seven days in the\r\nweek should be returned to. The economy lies in the fact that Biddy\r\ncleans up what might otherwise be a considerable waste, and in this way\r\nsupplies herself with a fair mash ration for the one day.\r\n\r\nOf course the green food and the grain ration are fed exactly as on any\r\nother day.\r\n\r\nThe original experiments in mustard feeding, referred to in this\r\nchapter, were conducted by Messrs. Ralph R. Allen, Editor of _Monthly\r\nHints on Poultry_, and Mr. A. J. Odam, at Llangammarch Wells Poultry\r\nFarm, Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nBreeding Hens During Moult--Coming Breeders Must be Kept Exercising\r\nThrough This Period\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hens which are to be breeders and the producers of the hatching\r\neggs for the coming Spring are selected as early in the Fall as\r\npossible. The quarters into which they are to be moved would have been\r\nmost carefully cleansed, and then disinfected with Kerosene and Crude\r\nCarbolic. After this, fresh, clean litter would be put in, and for\r\nthese yearling hens we make it a practice to place eight inches of\r\nstraw on the floor, for they have well learned the lesson of digging in\r\nthe litter and very rapidly knock the straw to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of a hen during the moult is to be inactive. In many cases\r\nshe feels far from comfortable. The growing of her new dress is a\r\nprocess which drains her system of an immense amount of vitality, still\r\nshe must be made to take a certain amount of exercise, and therefore\r\nthe litter must be constantly looked after, and kept in a condition\r\nwhich will compel her to work persistently for her grain ration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Overfeed\r\n\r\nThe Mash Boxes are most carefully watched, and the moment there is the\r\nslightest inclination not to clean the Mash up thoroughly, the quantity\r\nis cut down.\r\n\r\nIt would be somewhat easier if all the hens would moult simultaneously,\r\nbut this they do not do, and so the needs of the different individuals\r\nduring the moulting period have to be looked after.\r\n\r\nWith the Leghorn, the combs shrink, and almost go down to nothing in\r\nmany cases. It is quite impossible, in looking over a large number of\r\nyearling hens at this time in their lives, to believe that the great,\r\nred comb will ever return, and it is a curious fact that, in the\r\nmajority of cases, the yearling hen’s comb is never as large as it was\r\nin her pullet year.\r\n\r\nAs the combs begin to redden and their size increase, the flock becomes\r\nmore active, and it is necessary to add to the amount of Mash, and, if\r\nit had been found expedient to reduce the grain ration, this also must\r\nbe brought back to the full eight quarts to one hundred hens.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day the Mash consumption increases rapidly, and the nests\r\nbegin to receive a good deal of attention, and very shortly the output\r\nfrom the breeding pens becomes a very decided item in the gathering of\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nBy the second week in January, the pen having been handled in the best\r\npossible way, the egg output has reached a point where it will be safe\r\nto mate the pen, and in two weeks after this the eggs should be running\r\nstrongly fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nFeeding the Breeding Cockerels\r\n\r\n\r\nThese birds are fed green food about eight o’clock in the morning. In\r\ngood weather it is fed in their large range yard, where the attendant\r\nscatters it in small bunches over a wide area. At 11:30 is fed to every\r\nhundred birds, six quarts of corn, wheat and oats, two-thirds corn,\r\nthe wheat and oats making up the other third. This is also distributed\r\nwidely over the yard. In this way the cockerels are kept busy hunting\r\nfor food, and they are less likely to get into broils with each other\r\nfor entertainment.\r\n\r\nAt 1:30 o’clock they are allowed to return to their House, having been\r\nshut out during the morning hours. The Mash is fed daily at 1:30, and\r\na sufficient amount is placed in their troughs for them to thoroughly\r\nclean up by roosting time.\r\n\r\nSufficient grain is fed in the litter in the House to make the quantity\r\nfor the day’s rations about eight quarts for one hundred birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREEDING COCKERELS FALL OF 1911]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nPreparing Surplus Cockerels for Market\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing cockerels, fed in the same way as the pullets up to six\r\nor eight weeks of age, will be, in the majority of cases, in prime\r\ncondition to have the finishing touches applied to round them out into\r\nthe best possible weight at the age for market.\r\n\r\nWe, of course, do not go into the various liquid foods which are fed\r\nwith a pump, but simply the most inexpensive and rapid way of putting\r\nthe birds in a condition to return the most money in the shortest\r\npossible time. Corn, in its different forms, is, perhaps, the most\r\nfattening food which can be fed, and for the cockerels intended for\r\nmarket, the grain ration consists of nothing but corn, and as much of\r\nit as they will clean up.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to give the time to it, the mash, fed three times a\r\nday, will produce the finest quality flesh. A mash made from corn meal,\r\nground oats, gluten meal, middlings and bran, in equal parts, with\r\nbeef scrap, or green cut bone, equal to the total of the meals, and\r\nmoistened so that the birds can choke it down in large quantities, will\r\nproduce the result better, perhaps, than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nMust Have Green Food\r\n\r\nGreen food, however, should be given the bird at the most convenient\r\nhour in between the other feedings. If to save time in feeding was\r\nan object, a very good schedule is to feed corn first thing in the\r\nmorning, green food at about ten o’clock, and, between two and three,\r\nthe exact quantity of mash as described. If mash alone is fed, it is\r\nbest to feed each time only what the birds will clean up in from thirty\r\nto forty minutes, the troughs in which it is placed then being removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO. 3 LAYING HOUSE FILLED WITH 1500 PULLETS TWO WEEKS\r\nFROM THE RANGE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n$6.41 Per Hen Per Year Corning Method and Strain Enabling Others to\r\nBetter $6.41\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures at the head of this chapter have become famous, and,\r\nperhaps, in the way of small things, represent as great a bone of\r\ncontention as has been squabbled over for many a year. And yet there\r\nreally was nothing so extraordinary in the profit. It represented a\r\nlarge amount of careful work and study, a keen business administration,\r\na careful looking after of all the little details, the preserving\r\nof all by-products and selling them at a figure which was actually\r\nunder their true value, as was proven in later years by better prices\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the fertilizer made on the Farm has been so handled that\r\nits returns to the owners are much greater than when these figures were\r\ngiven to the public. The Corning Egg Farm was very much criticised in\r\nnumerous statements made in the different papers throughout the country\r\nas to the authenticity of these figures, and, to put it in clear\r\nAnglo-Saxon, many writers indulged quite freely in the word so much\r\nused by one of the distinguished Presidents of the United States, and\r\nthrew the lie indiscriminately at everything and everybody connected\r\nwith The Corning Egg Farm.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the humor of the situation dawned upon those who were\r\nbeing so adversely criticized. The fact is, the critics were people who\r\nwanted to gauge everything in the World by their own little yard stick.\r\nThey did not themselves know how to make $6.41 per hen per year, and,\r\ntherefore, they reasoned it out that the man did not exist who could.\r\nOne fact entirely overlooked by these profound writers on poultry\r\nsubjects was that two dollars of this profit was made by the sale of\r\nthe hen at the end of ten months of laying.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years there have appeared in the advertising columns\r\nof numerous publications, claims by a man selling a book in which he\r\nasserts he made $120.00 per hen, in twelve months, in a back-yard.\r\nAnother individual blossomed forth with a statement of ten dollars\r\nand fifty odd cents profit per hen per year, but these statements did\r\nnot excite widespread criticism. They were statements of men who were\r\ndoing a back-yard business, with from ten to twenty hens, and were,\r\ntherefore, simply looked upon as ridiculous and not entitled to serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n$6.41 Not Extravagant Claim\r\n\r\nBut The Corning Egg Farm “$6.41 per hen, per year” was not an\r\nextravagant claim, and the figures showing just exactly how it had been\r\naccomplished were plainly set forth. It was not done with twenty hens\r\nin a back-yard, but on a large, commercial scale, and an extensive\r\nbusiness was in active operation.\r\n\r\nThe methods were so entirely new, and the results so unprecedented,\r\nthat poultry writers and lecturers hastily declared them fantastic,\r\nwithout the careful investigation to which they were entitled, and\r\nproceeded to wholesale condemnation of the figures, the methods, and\r\neverything else connected with the Farm.\r\n\r\nHowever, later, the majority of our critics have visited The Corning\r\nEgg Farm, and have seen what we have, what we are doing, and satisfied\r\nthemselves thoroughly that every statement made was well within the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the profit of $6.41 was figured with the\r\ncockerels selling at the live weight price of broilers, and when no\r\nhatching eggs were sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Farm Making More Than $6.41\r\n\r\nAt The Corning Egg Farm, to-day, the hen is making considerably more\r\nthan $6.41 per year. A large number of cockerels, which formerly\r\nbrought merely the live weight broiler price, are now being reared and\r\ndisposed of for breeders. Hatching eggs are sold in large quantities,\r\nbut, it must be remembered, before one can reach this point, his\r\nStrain of birds must be brought to a high point of perfection, he must\r\nestablish his reputation, and his customers must find his claims are\r\nsubstantiated. As an illustration, purchasers of hatching eggs from\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm, in the season of 1910, came back with orders for\r\nthe season of 1911 increased by the multiple of ten, and these same\r\ncustomers are already booking large orders in September and October,\r\n1911, for the hatching season of 1912.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is written to emphasize our statement that anyone\r\npossessed of the ordinary qualifications to succeed with poultry, can,\r\nby following The Corning Egg Farm Method, surely build up a large and\r\nprofitable business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WORK SHOP ON THE CORNING EGG FARM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nThe Buildings on the Corning Egg Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buildings on the The Corning Egg Farm, at the close of the year\r\n1911, were as follows:\r\n\r\n  No. 1--Brooder House, with Incubator and Sprouted Oats Cellars\r\n  underneath.\r\n\r\n  No. 2--Work Shop, Grain Bins, Egg Packing Room, Refrigerator Room,\r\n  and Quarters for the Resident Foreman, all under one roof.\r\n\r\n  No. 3--Breeding House.\r\n\r\n  No. 4--Laying House No. 1.\r\n\r\n  No. 5--Laying House No. 2.\r\n\r\n  No. 6--Laying House No. 3.\r\n\r\n  No. 7--Line Breeding House.\r\n\r\n  No. 8--Breeding Cockerel House.\r\n\r\n  No. 9--Horse Stable.\r\n\r\n  No. 10--Wagon Shed.\r\n\r\n  No. 11--41 Colony Houses Scattered over the Range.\r\n\r\n  No. 12--Office Building.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the magnitude of The Corning Egg Farm, there are\r\nunder roof 18,455 square feet of floor space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Brooder House, Incubator and Sprouted Oats Cellars\r\n\r\nThis building is 264 feet in length, and consists really of two\r\nbuildings. When this structure was first erected it was sixteen feet\r\nwide and fifty feet in length. The Incubator Cellar is entirely of\r\nconcrete construction, with a Brooder House one story in height above\r\nit. The floor joists were all beam filled, making the building rat\r\nproof. The second year it became necessary to enlarge the Brooder\r\nHouse, and an extension was built, sixty-eight feet in length, and set\r\nup on cedar posts, with concrete filled in on top of the sills between\r\nthe floor joists, making this part of the building also rat-proof.\r\n\r\nAfter using this Brooder House and Incubator Cellar for three seasons\r\na still further enlargement became an absolute necessity. Sixteen feet\r\nhas been, and still is, the standard width of Laying Houses on The\r\nCorning Egg Farm. It has been found, however, with the Brooder House,\r\nan additional width is desirable in order to give the chicks more roomy\r\nruns when confined by bad weather to the House alone. Mainly for this\r\nreason, the 1911 addition to the Brooder House has been made twenty-two\r\nfeet in width. This new building is 146 feet in length. It is joined on\r\nto the old building in such a way that the alley-way merely widens at\r\nthe point of connection, thus making one continuous House.\r\n\r\nThe interior arrangement of a four foot alley-way, the entire length of\r\nthe building, along the north wall, greatly facilitates the feeding,\r\nwatering, and general care of the chicks, without disturbing them by\r\npassing through the pens.\r\n\r\nThe raised hover floor starts at the south side of this alley-way, and\r\nis raised about a foot so as to allow the passing underneath of the hot\r\nwater trunk line, with its perfect insulation. Attached to this hover\r\nfloor, by hinges, is an inclined runway, which is raised or lowered\r\nby a cord running through pulley wheels and fastened by cleats to the\r\nnorth wall.\r\n\r\nThe division wires between the pens are of inch mesh, four feet high,\r\nbrought down to a ten inch board which is securely fastened to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation is acquired by the use of V-shaped window drops, placed\r\njust under the plate, full detailed drawing of which is given in the\r\nback of this Book. The bottom of the windows, on the south front of\r\nthe building, are three feet above the floors, and these windows are\r\nforty-four inches in length and thirty-six inches in width. They are\r\nhung at the top, and are opened and closed by the same sort of device\r\nused in churches for the “Cathedral” window. The holes in the fastening\r\nirons are about two inches apart, allowing the window to be firmly held\r\nopen to any degree desired.\r\n\r\nThere is a slide board at the back of the hover, which is easily\r\nraised, materially assisting in the quick and perfect cleansing of the\r\nhover floor. Hanging above this, and using the slide board as a sill,\r\nis a gate which extends to the height of the wire division, and swings\r\nout, giving the attendant ready access to the hover, drinking cups, etc.\r\n\r\nThe whole Brooder House is heated by hot water coils, extending along\r\nthe entire length of the north wall of the building. These are of two\r\ninch pipe, and in the sixteen feet part of the building there are six,\r\nwhile in the twenty-two foot extension there are eight pipes.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the Brooder House is built over the Incubator and Sprouted\r\nOats Cellars. The Sprouted Oats Cellar is entirely of concrete, and the\r\nfloor slopes to one point, where drains carry off the water, allowing\r\nthe frames to slowly drain themselves, and preventing the oats from\r\nrotting from an over supply of moisture.\r\n\r\nAccess is given to the Incubator Cellar by a vestibule in which are\r\nlocated broad stairways, enabling one to go from the Cellar to the\r\nBrooder House without going outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe heater room occupies the first 30 feet of this Cellar, and is\r\ndivided from the incubator room proper by an eight inch concrete wall.\r\nIn this heater room is the large hot water boiler which heats the\r\nBrooder House, above. There are also two automatic heaters, controlling\r\nthe trunk line pipes for the heating of the air passing up under the\r\nhovers in the Brooder House. The incubator heaters also stand in this\r\nroom, the pipes passing through the division wall, connecting with the\r\nincubators on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe floor is smooth surface concrete, there being a gentle slope in\r\nthe heater room all to one corner, where a drain carries off the water\r\nused in flushing the floor. This same arrangement exists also in the\r\nIncubator Cellar proper, allowing the hose to be used in flooding the\r\nfloor twice a day to give the proper amount of moisture for incubation.\r\n\r\nThe concrete blocks used in the construction of this Cellar are what\r\nis known as rock faced, and the face is on the inside, pointed up in\r\nblack. The floor joists overhead are dressed lumber, and are painted\r\nin the following manner: the priming coat is almost pure oil with\r\njust enough lead to give it a whitish tinge; the next coat is dead\r\nwhite, flat finish, and the third is white enamel of the best stock\r\nobtainable. The incubators are finished in the same way, allowing the\r\nwhole Cellar to be literally scrubbed with a brush.\r\n\r\nThis Cellar has no duplicate, anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding No. 2, Work Shop, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Work Shop proper is twenty by thirty feet, on a concrete\r\nfoundation, with a cement floor. The height from the floor to the\r\nrafters is ten feet in the clear. In this room stands a ten horse power\r\nGasolene Engine, and a large Mixer, the second Mixer designed by The\r\nCorning Egg Farm, which produces a mix in less time, and with less\r\npower, than any other machine to-day on the market. With the necessary\r\nmeals and green cut bone, in seven minutes the juices from the bone are\r\nso uniformly distributed throughout the entire mass that it is almost\r\nimpossible to believe that no water has been added. The weight of a\r\nmix will average about five hundred pounds. In experiments with beef\r\nscrap in The Corning Egg Farm Mash, in ten minutes’ time the meals\r\nare completely coated with oils which come from good beef scrap when\r\nproperly mixed. This Mixer is now being made by Wilson Bros., Easton,\r\nPa., in different sizes, from hand to horse power, to meet the needs of\r\nlarge and small plants.\r\n\r\nThe Bone Cutter is also made by Wilson Bros., and, in our opinion, is\r\nthe best Bone Cutter on the market, and we have tried all the different\r\ndesigns. Wilson Bros. manufacture these cutters in all sizes, from hand\r\npower up to the large one which they first built for The Corning Egg\r\nFarm, and we have graduated in size, during the past years from a hand\r\npower to the Large Cutter now in use.\r\n\r\nThere is also a large Clover Cutter, which will cut in various lengths\r\nfrom a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half. The necessary pulleys\r\nand hangers for this machine are placed in the rafters above.\r\n\r\nBuilt into the rear and sides of this room are the various grain bins,\r\ncompactly arranged to reduce the labor of handling to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIn the Work Shop is also a bench, with vices, etc., and cupboards,\r\nbuilt into the walls, where complete kits of tools for carpentry,\r\nplumbing, hot water fitting, etc., are kept, in order that the\r\nmechanical work, so far as repairs and keeping up the efficiency of the\r\nplant go, is done without calling in outside labor.\r\n\r\nBack of the Shop, and connecting with it, is the Egg Packing Room,\r\nwith its necessary arrangement of shelves, tables, etc., for the work\r\ncarried on there.\r\n\r\nTo the rear of the Egg Packing Room, but having no connection with\r\nit whatever, is the room in which the large Freezer stands, for the\r\npreservation of green bone. The concrete floor in this room is sloped\r\nto a drain so that it may be thoroughly cleansed every day after the\r\nbone is taken out or put into the Freezer. The Freezer itself has a\r\ncapacity of 2500 lbs. of bone, but the room, under ordinary conditions\r\nof weather, maintains such a temperature that there is no difficulty in\r\ncarrying bone in barrels, standing around the room, which increases our\r\nstoring capacity to more than double the quantity.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor of the Work Shop is a complete and modern apartment\r\nin which the working foreman lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding No. 9, Horse Stable\r\n\r\nThis is constructed on the general plan of all the buildings on the\r\nFarm, with capacity for four horses, and with necessary room for hay,\r\netc., in the loft above.\r\n\r\nA large shed is built at the rear of the stable, in which bins are\r\nconstructed for the carrying of grit and shell, and also for the\r\nstorage of packing crates for eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding No. 10, Wagon Shed\r\n\r\nThis is conveniently placed to the stable, and is twenty by forty\r\nfeet, with four sets of double doors, allowing the placing of vehicles\r\nwithout interfering with those already inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding No. 12, Office Building\r\n\r\nConveniently arranged in three rooms covering a floor space of nine\r\nhundred and twenty-five square feet, hot water heated, and with\r\nelectric lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CELEBRATED CORNING LARGE FLOCK LAYING HOUSE NO. 3\r\nCARRYING 1500 PULLETS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nConstruction of Laying, Breeding, and Breeding Cockerel Houses\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Breeding and Laying Houses, on The Corning Egg Farm, are all built\r\nin the manner described in the remainder of this chapter, and are each\r\n160 feet long. The Breeding Cockerel House is 60 feet in length. These\r\nHouses are all fifteen feet, nine inches, in width, the drawing in of\r\nthem being three inches for the purpose of making the roof rafters,\r\nwhich are sixteen feet in length, readily reach out to the end of the\r\nplates, on the slant which they carry. The height of the buildings\r\nfrom the ground, over all, is twelve feet, two inches at the back and\r\nfourteen feet, two inches in front.\r\n\r\nThe interior of these buildings is divided into 20 foot sections, by\r\npartitions extending out from the north wall of the buildings, seven\r\nfeet, and forming the roosting closets. These partitions run from the\r\nfloor clear to the ceiling, breaking the draughts, which but for them,\r\nwould make the long Laying Houses utterly impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe north wall of the Laying House is five feet high in the clear,\r\nthe south wall being seven feet. This makes a sufficient height for\r\nwalking through the building without stooping, and, as the bottom of\r\nthe windows is carried up three feet from the floor, the window itself\r\ngoing up to the plate under the roof, the Sun reaches every part of the\r\nHouse of practically sixteen feet wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly Six Feet from Ground\r\n\r\nThe buildings are all set on posts, three feet in the ground and five\r\nfeet above. The floor joists are ten inches in width and two inches\r\nthick, and, instead of the usual sill, two by ten planks are spiked at\r\nboth ends of these floor joists resting on the posts which support the\r\nbuilding. This construction is much simpler than the ordinary sills,\r\nand is also less expensive.\r\n\r\nThe posts are eight feet apart and well braced. They are cross tied at\r\nthe corners, and about every fifty feet throughout the building; they\r\nare also braced at the ends.\r\n\r\nThe floor joists are placed three feet apart, and the uprights are\r\nmade of two by four joists, placed three feet apart. At the corners of\r\nthe House the upright supports are doubled, making the corner posts\r\nequivalent to four by four.\r\n\r\nThe construction of these buildings without any projections over the\r\ntop of the roof has two advantages. First, there is a saving in the\r\nquantity of lumber used and in labor expended; second, all the joints\r\nof the roof and walls are made tighter, and the lapping of the roofing\r\nover the edges of the building and cementing it make all joints\r\nabsolutely air and water tight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAYING HOUSE PREPARED TO RECEIVE 1500 PULLETS FROM\r\nRANGE]\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble Floors\r\n\r\nThe floors are all built double. The under floor may be of any kind of\r\nrough boards, and carefully covered over with one ply roofing of any\r\ngood quality, the laps, as elsewhere in the building, being carefully\r\ncemented and nailed down with large, flat headed, galvanized nails\r\nmade for the purpose. The upper floor should be of a cheap quality\r\nof tongued and grooved boards, well driven up and securely nailed.\r\nPreferably this upper flooring is laid crosswise of the building.\r\n\r\nThe outside of these buildings is covered with any cheap, rough boards\r\nobtainable. These should be securely nailed over the studding of the\r\nbuilding, and then covered with a good grade of two ply roofing paper.\r\nOn the sides and ends of the building the roofing should be put on\r\nupright, but on the roof it is better to lay it lengthwise of the\r\nbuilding and lapped, on the plan of laying shingles, the joints all\r\nbeing securely cemented and nailed down, and then the joints and nails\r\npainted over with cement, to make sure against any possible leaks.\r\n\r\nThe inside walls of the building are lined with one ply roofing, with\r\nthe joints carefully nailed and cemented, and then both walls and\r\nceiling are covered with matched flooring. This gives four inches of\r\ndead air space to all the walls of the building, making them cooler in\r\nSummer and warmer in Winter than any other known construction. Owing to\r\nthe roof rafters being ten inches in width, the dead air space under\r\nthe roof is of course ten inches.\r\n\r\nThe three outsides of the building, north, east and west, are covered\r\nwith roofing down to the ground, there being, of course, no inner\r\nlining below the floor under the House. To the south the House is\r\nentirely open from the floor to the ground. Each House, raised\r\nfive feet from the ground and open to the south, gets the sunlight\r\nunderneath clear to the back of the building, which eliminates all\r\ndampness, and, being so open prevents rats and other vermin making any\r\nattempt to get into the House.\r\n\r\nThe window openings are nine feet long by three and a half feet in\r\nwidth. As the studding is three feet apart this permits the making of\r\nthe openings without cutting the studding, and so weakening any of the\r\nsupports under the roof. These openings are spaced off so that their\r\ntotal length comes as near as may be to one-half the length of the\r\nsouth front of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanvas Windows\r\n\r\nVentilators, one foot in width and occupying the space between the\r\nwindow openings, have recently been constructed in these Houses,\r\nwhich permit the closing of all canvas windows tight at night, when\r\nthe weather is very cold, letting the air come in through these\r\nventilators, at the top, without bringing any draughts down upon the\r\nbirds. Detailed plans of these ventilators will be found at the end of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE BREEDING HOUSES IN 1911]\r\n\r\nThe frames of the curtained windows are made of one by four inch\r\nboards, with two center supports dividing the window frame into three\r\nfoot sections. These frames are covered with medium weight cotton duck,\r\nfrom which the dust must be brushed at regular intervals to permit the\r\nair to circulate through them freely.\r\n\r\nOutside of the Office, Brooder House, Work Shop, Stable and the\r\nResident Quarters, no glass is used in any of the buildings, with the\r\nexception of one small pane in the door of each Laying House, through\r\nwhich a view of the interior may be had.\r\n\r\nA hood, extending out eight inches, is built over the windows and\r\nventilators, the whole length of the buildings. This prevents the rain\r\nfrom southerly storms beating into the Houses.\r\n\r\nThe windows are hung on hinges, and open inward from the top, and are\r\nfastened to the ceiling with wooden buttons.\r\n\r\nThe front of all of the window openings, on the outside, is covered\r\nwith one inch mesh wire netting, to prevent the birds from flying out,\r\nand also to prevent sparrows and other birds from flying in to consume\r\nthe grain provided for the fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble Doors\r\n\r\nThere are double doors at both ends of each House, swinging inward,\r\nthe opening being six feet in width. These doors are made of two\r\nthicknesses of matched boards, one side being vertical, and the other\r\ndiagonal, with a lining of roofing paper between. These are kept closed\r\nonly in cold and stormy weather.\r\n\r\nA board, twelve inches wide, is fastened to the floor a little over\r\nthree feet back from the door opening. This board runs across the\r\nwidth of the House for six feet, and at that point a board of the same\r\nwidth, three feet long, is fastened to it and carried down to the end\r\nwall of the House. This makes a clear space in which the doors can be\r\nswung open without being blocked by the litter, which the hens would\r\notherwise be sure to bank up against the doors. A vestibule of wire\r\nnetting, on sectional frames, is fastened to the ceiling and baseboard,\r\nwith wire hooks and eyes. See details shown in drawing, at the back of\r\nthe Book.\r\n\r\nThe second pair of doors, which open outward, are covered with inch\r\nmesh wire down to within three feet of the floor, and are used during\r\nthe Summer months and in mild weather in Winter.\r\n\r\nA small glass window, about eight by ten, is placed in one of the\r\nsolid doors at a convenient height. This enables one to observe the\r\nconditions in the Laying Houses without being obliged to open the door.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of all the Laying Houses there is a flight of stairs\r\nwith a platform at the top, five feet square and with a hand rail\r\naround it, giving easy access to the House through the end from which\r\nthe least number of violent storms comes. The east ends of the Laying\r\nHouses do not have steps and platforms.\r\n\r\nThe dropping boards are placed three feet above the floor in all the\r\nHouses, except in the Cockerel House, where they are thirty inches\r\nfrom the floor, as we found the growing cockerels needed additional\r\nspace overhead to prevent injury to their combs. This leaves abundance\r\nof room in the Laying Houses for the birds to work in the litter, and\r\nis also of sufficient height to allow a man to get under the dropping\r\nboards to search for the eggs which the hens often deposit in the\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\nThis height also gives the Sun an opportunity to reach every nook and\r\ncorner of the House at some time during the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDraught-Proof Roosting Closets\r\n\r\nThe partitions dividing the twenty foot sections of the roosting\r\nclosets, as previously explained, are seven feet in width, extending\r\nout one foot beyond the dropping boards, which are six feet wide, and\r\nthus giving absolute protection to the hen, sitting on the roost, from\r\nany draughts which may be blowing through the House.\r\n\r\nTwo sets of roosts are placed in each roosting closet, each consisting\r\nof five perches, of two by two spruce, nine feet, ten inches long,\r\nrounded at the top and nailed to a cross piece of the same material.\r\nThe first perch stands nine inches from the back wall; the others are\r\nthirteen inches from center to center. Birds larger than the Leghorns\r\nrequire more space between perches than here specified. The two sets\r\nof roosts are placed side by side, and are fastened at the back with\r\na bolt, as shown in the plans. When the dropping boards are being\r\ncleaned, the roosts are raised up and fastened to hooks suspended in\r\nthe ceiling. They are supported in front by a piece of joist one foot\r\nhigh securely nailed to the cross pieces of the roosts.\r\n\r\nThere are openings under the dropping boards in all the Houses for the\r\negress and ingress of the fowls, with a runway leading to the ground\r\nunderneath. These openings are securely boxed and are covered at top\r\nand bottom to prevent any draughts. The detail of these openings is\r\nshown in the plans at the back of the Book.\r\n\r\nThe nests are all made of boxes bought from grocers and other dealers\r\nin the neighborhood, and are much cheaper and better than any nests\r\nlaid out and built by mechanics. They are put up in three tiers, and\r\nfill up the spaces between the windows, as shown in the detailed\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe boxes are cut down to twelve by fourteen inches, which makes the\r\nbest sized nest.\r\n\r\nIn the floor of each Laying House there are three hatchways dividing\r\nthe length of the building into four equal parts. These hatchways are\r\nfor convenience in removing the litter, and greatly facilitate the\r\noperation and reduce the necessary amount of labor, because a wagon can\r\nbe backed directly underneath. If the wagon should be too high, shovel\r\nout a runway for the wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORNING COLONY HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThese hatchways are made of two thicknesses of boards with roofing\r\nbetween and are rabbited and securely fastened.\r\n\r\nThe nesting material used is fine excelsior. This is better than straw\r\nor shavings as it does not offer a convenient home for lice, and, if\r\nthe nests be thoroughly disinfected with Crude Carbolic and Kerosene,\r\nthere is no danger of having any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Colony Houses--There are Forty-one on the Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Houses have a floor space 6 × 10 feet, are six feet high in front\r\nand five feet in the rear, with a shed roof. The frame work is built on\r\nthree skids. The outside skids are made of 3 × 4 timbers, rounded at\r\nthe ends to facilitate the ready sliding of the Houses when it becomes\r\ndesirable to move them, and 12 feet in length, making a projection of a\r\nfoot at either end beyond the sides of the House. Two by four studding\r\nis used for the center skid. The three skids are securely fastened\r\ntogether by four pieces of 2 × 4 studding. To this frame is nailed the\r\nfloor, of inch, matched boards. The upright studs are made of 2 × 3’s.\r\nIn the first Colony Houses we built, 2 × 4’s were used, but it was\r\nfound there was an economy in using 2 × 3’s, and, as they answer every\r\npurpose, the frame being absolutely stiff, they were substituted for\r\nthe 2 × 4’s, and they have been used ever since.\r\n\r\nThe frame work is covered by a cheap grade of matched flooring, the\r\nboards running perpendicularly. The roof is covered with cheap, twelve\r\ninch, rough boards, and over this is laid two ply roofing, this being\r\ncarried over the front, back and sides three inches, well cemented and\r\nsecurely nailed down, then all the joints are again cemented, covering\r\nthe nails thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCotton Duck Windows\r\n\r\nThe door, for the use of the attendant, is in the front of the House,\r\nbeing two feet wide and the full height of the inside of the building.\r\nOn either side of the door, hanging by hinges from the plates, are two\r\nwindows 45 × 27 inches. These are covered with a medium weight cotton\r\nduck, and open outward. A device which carries a long hook readily\r\nallows them to be fastened so as to practically form an awning, which\r\nmaterially assists in maintaining a cool condition inside the House\r\nduring the Summer. Two doors for the use of the birds are placed\r\non each side of the main door, and are fitted with slides. On the\r\ninside of the window openings one inch wire mesh is securely nailed,\r\npreventing the birds from flying out, and also keeping night prowlers\r\nfrom going in. Over the outside of the window frames also inch wire\r\nmesh is nailed. The main reason for this wiring of the outside is to\r\nprevent the birds, as they develop and fly up on top of the Colony\r\nHouse, from breaking through the canvas.\r\n\r\nFrom the detailed drawings which will be found at the end of the Book,\r\nand the photograph of the Colony House, a very clear idea is given of\r\nits construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nMaterials Required for Laying House\r\n\r\n\r\nBill of material for the construction of 60 feet, being three sections\r\nof the Corning Laying House.\r\n\r\n  14 Posts, 8′ long, 4″ top diameter.\r\n\r\n  Cross Braces at ends, and Corner Braces--5 pieces, 2″ × 6″ × 16′.\r\n\r\n  Floor Joists and Roof Rafters, 42 pieces--2″ × 10″ × 16′.\r\n\r\n  Under Floor, 1000′ cheap, wide boards.\r\n\r\n  Upper Floor, 1200′ #4 flooring.\r\n\r\n  Inside Ceiling, 2500′ #4 flooring.\r\n\r\n  Outside Covering and Roof, cheap wide boards, 2400′.\r\n\r\n  Uprights, 38 pieces, 2″ × 4″ × 12′.\r\n\r\n  Plates, 10 pieces, 2″ × 4″ × 12′.\r\n\r\n  Dropping Boards, 450′ #4 flooring.\r\n\r\n  Dropping Boards supports, 3 pieces, 2″ × 4″ × 20′, and 3 pieces, 2″ ×\r\n  4″ × 12′.\r\n\r\n  Lath, 500 lineal feet 1″ × 2″.\r\n\r\n  Partitions, 100′ #4 flooring.\r\n\r\n  Hoods, 60 lineal feet, pine, 1″ × 8″.\r\n\r\n  Sills, 3 pieces pine, 1″ × 10″ × 10′.\r\n\r\n  Window Frames, pine, 1″ × 4″; 2 pieces, 10′ and 1 piece 12′ long.\r\n\r\n  One roll of roofing contains 108 square feet.\r\n\r\n  For Lining between floors             10 rolls\r\n  Lining between walls, sides and ends   9 rolls\r\n                                        --\r\n            All of one ply              19 rolls\r\n  All outside covering, two ply         25 rolls\r\n\r\n  Ventilators to be the length between the windows, with width of\r\n  opening 12 inches.

The above list will enable anyone to\r\nwork out the full bill of lumber required, and the builder or lumber\r\ndealer will be able to give the prices in a very few moments.\r\n\r\nThe cost of labor on the Laying Houses is from $1.50 to $1.75\r\nper running foot. This would include every item of labor in the\r\nconstruction of these Houses down to the smallest detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nThe Original Thirty Hens\r\n\r\n\r\nThe egg production of the Original Thirty Hens on The Corning Egg Farm\r\nis an interesting story, but, of course, it must be remembered that\r\nthis record is of one hundred and fifty-three days, the banner days of\r\nthe year for eggs from yearling hens.\r\n\r\nThe Biddies arrived in different lots, the last days of February, our\r\nrecord beginning with March first, and ending with July 31st. During\r\nthat period they laid 2466 eggs, and at the end of the third month we\r\nlost two of them. The cause of death we were unable to tell, for, at\r\nthat time our experience was not of sufficient duration to have made\r\neven a close guess.\r\n\r\nThe average for the birds, it will be noted, was eighty-five eggs per\r\nhen. Had we been better posted as to feeding methods, doubtless the\r\nhens would have been capable of producing eggs in numbers considerably\r\ngreater than the figures show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PULLETS IN LAYING HOUSE NO. 2, FALL OF 1911]\r\n\r\nThe record, however, for real yearling hens (and these were real\r\nyearling hens, because when they started to lay with us they were fully\r\neighteen months of age), was very far from a poor one, and the novice\r\nwho succeeds in caring for his breeding stock in such a way that he\r\ndoes not fall short of this average, may consider that he has done very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nEgg Records\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 1st, 1908 to June 30th, 1911.\r\n\r\n                                  Average   Production    Average\r\n             Dates                 Number    of Eggs       Price\r\n                                  of Hens                 per doz.\r\n  Feb. 1, 1908 to Jan. 31, 1909    2,040     338,976       .5066\r\n  Feb. 1, 1909 to June 30, 1910    2,811     709,836       .47125\r\n  July 1, 1910 to June 30, 1911    4,723     612,000       .4618\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE FOR FIRST TEN MONTHS OF PULLET LAYING IN FLOCKS OF FIFTEEN\r\nHUNDRED.\r\n\r\n  1909     143.25\r\n  1910     145.11\r\n  1911     146.23\r\n\r\nOn examination of this Egg Record it will be noticed that in the\r\naverage number of eggs laid by the pullets, in flocks of fifteen\r\nhundred, there have been three gains, and in analyzing these averages\r\nit must be remembered that these are results obtained, not by the\r\nhandling of a few pullets most carefully selected to produce a record,\r\nbut of thousands, and the advance of three eggs in the average is\r\ntherefore a remarkable gain.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Corning Farm Is Able To Get Great Egg Records\r\n\r\nThe salient reasons which make possible such egg records as The Corning\r\nEgg Farm is able to show are:\r\n\r\n1st,--Careful selection of breeders by the Corning Method, which is the\r\nonly proper Method and has already been described.\r\n\r\n2nd,--Pullets raised on free range, feeding to them a strengthening\r\nand upbuilding ration, which constantly supplies new tissues, and is,\r\ntherefore, a nutritious and not a forcing food.\r\n\r\n3rd,--Housing them in The Corning Laying House, which to-day stands\r\nunequaled, where they are practically outdoors yet protected from\r\nextremes of heat and cold, for if hens are to lay to their capacity\r\nthey must be kept always in a perfectly comfortable condition.\r\n\r\n4th,--The succulent, green food, which is so necessary to their welfare\r\nif they are to lay strongly, and which must be given to them in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nHens on the ordinary free range, in the general run of seasons, after\r\nJuly 1st., cannot find succulent green food in sufficient quantities to\r\nenable them to keep up even a fair average of eggs. Receipts of eggs\r\nat all large market centers, begin to fall off at about this date, and\r\nprices correspondingly increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighest Percentage of Fertility\r\n\r\nEvery observer, viewing the stock of The Corning Egg Farm, is at once\r\nconvinced that the scientific Method here employed produces better\r\nbirds than any other. The steady increase, from year to year, in the\r\nhatchability of the eggs towards full fertility; the strong, livable\r\nchicks, their rapid growth to maturity; and the voluntary testimony\r\ngiven by our customers whose ever increasing orders come back to us,\r\nyear after year, all conclusively establish the fact that hens bred and\r\nraised by The Corning Method are unequaled anywhere.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years hatching eggs have been shipped from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific, and from the Northern part of Canada to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and even across the Atlantic to far away Scotland. From\r\nthis widely extended territory comes the unsolicited testimony that The\r\nCorning Strain of Single Comb White Leghorns is unequaled.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the amount of labor carried on The Corning Egg Farm\r\nis one working foreman and three laborers. The latter are $1.50 a day\r\nmen, and, with this force all the work of the farm is accomplished.\r\nThe Houses are thoroughly cleaned, as to the dropping boards, drinking\r\nfountain stands, tops of nests, and the inside of nests where required,\r\nevery day in the week and three hundred and sixty-five days in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen the Colony Houses are in use they are cleaned and rebedded every\r\ntwo or three weeks, as required, during the first part of the Spring.\r\nAfter the first part of the season is over, say from July 1st., they\r\nare not cleaned as often for the reason that there is very little\r\ndampness, and so long as the Houses remain dry, the cleaning is not\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe cost of feed in the last two years has gone up materially, and\r\nit now requires an outlay of about eighteen cents to raise a Leghorn\r\ncockerel to broiler size. The cost of raising a pullet to the laying\r\npoint is forty-two and a half cents, which includes cost of incubation.\r\nThe pullet, through her first ten months of laying, costs $1.15.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to give a fixed figure as to the cost of\r\ncaring for the coming breeder through the time of moult, during the\r\nmonths when she is producing eggs for hatching, and up to the time when\r\nshe is shipped, in August, eleven months in all. Different seasons\r\nand different flocks of birds vary in the amount of food necessary\r\nduring these months. Our records show, however, that the output of eggs\r\nthrough the moulting season from the birds which we are carrying for\r\nhatching eggs has always been enough to show a profit over the feeding\r\ncost. It would be safe to figure that the outlay will be between one\r\ndollar and forty and one dollar and fifty cents. These amounts, as\r\ngiven, represent the cost of feeding and the cost of labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nPrevention and Treatment of Diseases\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases in poultry generally come from neglecting sanitary conditions.\r\nA damp house, filthy drinking fountains, musty and sour foods, or a\r\ngeneral condition of filth, bring diseases, whether the birds are kept\r\nin large or small flocks.\r\n\r\nAn ailing bird should at once be removed and isolated, and, unless it\r\nshows immediate signs of recovery, the best remedy, and the safest,\r\nis the hatchet. The constant and systematic spraying of the roosting\r\nclosets, the drinking trough platforms, underneath the dropping boards,\r\nand in the corners between the sections, with Kerosene Oil and Crude\r\nCarbolic (and it must be remembered that the solution used for spraying\r\nis one-half gallon of Crude Carbolic to five gallons of Kerosene\r\nOil, when the birds are in the House), will eliminate all danger of\r\ncontagion, provided the Houses, in all other respects, are kept in a\r\nproper and cleanly condition.\r\n\r\nWhen the pullets are first put into the House, in the Fall of the year,\r\nit is wise to watch with great care that individuals in the flock do\r\nnot develop the “snuffles,” which mean increasing trouble of a more\r\nserious nature if allowed to go without attention.\r\n\r\nThe washing of the drinking cups of the fountains with Kerosene Oil,\r\nand Potassium Permanganate in the water once a week, will, in most\r\ncases, keep the flock immune from trouble. Spraying is one of the best\r\ncures for colds, as it not only restores the affected bird to health,\r\nbut clears up the danger of infection which, otherwise, might result in\r\nspreading disease among the whole flock.\r\n\r\nWe have never had a “run” of any disease at The Corning Egg Farm. Gapes\r\nand White Diarrhœa--the most dreaded of all young chick diseases--are\r\nunknown on the Farm. This is attributed to the strong vitality and\r\nvigorous condition maintained by fresh air housing, cleanliness,\r\nsanitary regulation, and by giving sweet, wholesome food and plenty of\r\npure, fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nA Word in Closing\r\n\r\n\r\nOur business is running The Corning Egg Farm and not writing books, so\r\nthat in telling our Story we may have lacked some of the polish of the\r\nexperienced author, but every word that we have written is true, and we\r\nshall be very glad to welcome any of our readers at the Farm, and let\r\nthem see for themselves just what we have.\r\n\r\nThe Corning Egg Farm actually does enjoy the supreme position among\r\nthe egg farms of the World that we claim for it, and that the great\r\nauthorities, after thorough, personal examination, have frankly\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nAnd we have been far more open in telling you everything that has been\r\ndone on the Farm than, for instance, owners of large manufacturing\r\nplants would be.\r\n\r\nMethods and problems in the successful and profitable production of\r\neggs for table and hatching purposes have been worked out on The\r\nCorning Egg Farm, and we are quite willing others should have the\r\nbenefit of our very expensively acquired experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing to Hide\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to hide; nothing to keep to ourselves. We started in a\r\nvery modest way, and believe that is the preferable way to successfully\r\nbuild up a paying poultry farm. Those who have an abundance of capital\r\nmight be tempted to work out too many self-evolved theories and to\r\nbegin on too elaborate and extravagant a basis, whereas, in our\r\nopinion, it is wiser to follow precedent, known successes, and start in\r\na smaller way and expand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrations are Photographs\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in this Book are all from photographs, and the camera\r\ncannot be persuaded to exaggerate or to show buildings where there are\r\nnone. The diagrams are drawn of sufficient size, and such measurements\r\ngiven, that our plant in its entirety, or any part of it, can be\r\nreadily reproduced by anyone who cares to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Corning Success\r\n\r\nThe success we have made on the Farm gives us a certain feeling\r\nof satisfaction that we are entitled to enjoy, and yet we have\r\naccomplished nothing that cannot be done by any person who will give as\r\nmuch thought, time and attention to the work as we have.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Advice to Beginners\r\n\r\nOur advice to the beginner is that he carefully study the Corning\r\nMethod as set forth in this Book (and we want to impress upon you again\r\nthe fact that the Corning Method is just as adaptable to the town\r\nlot as to the large tract, and in this particular it surpasses other\r\nsystems which have had considerable publicity), and then start, either\r\nwith a breeding pen, or with an incubator and hatching eggs purchased\r\nfrom a Breeder whose eggs can be depended upon, and in this connection\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle Comb White Leghorns Only\r\n\r\nwe want to say that for the production of eggs there is only one breed\r\nof fowls--Single Comb White Leghorns--and that, in considering the\r\npurchase of a breeding pen, or eggs for hatching, experience will\r\nshow that it is the height of folly to begrudge the additional price\r\nyou must pay in order to get the right kind of Stock. Whether you buy\r\nCorning Strain or not, let us again emphasize the fact that no matter\r\nhow famous the Breeder, or how high his prices, if he has not a Strain\r\nthat has proved itself a good Strain, you do not want it at any price.\r\nIt is\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s “Strain” You Want\r\n\r\nStrain that counts, because it includes every good quality for the\r\npurpose, and the market for the right Strain for breeding and hatching\r\nis a very large and profitable one. The Corning Egg Farm cannot produce\r\nenough birds and eggs to fill its orders, and probably never will,\r\nbecause we do not believe in increasing the size of the Farm beyond our\r\nability to be personally in constant touch with every detail connected\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtility, Not Show Birds\r\n\r\nWe want to write just a word or two as to the difference between\r\na Strain for the production of eggs and of Show Birds. It must be\r\nremembered that a great laying Strain cannot be, at the same time,\r\na Show Bird, at least not under the present requirements of the\r\nAssociation, because a great egg layer must have size, and must be bred\r\nto produce size, and not inbred to secure fancy Show points, which\r\nproduce a bird without constitution, and eggs from birds of the show\r\nclass are small, the fertility runs low, and, in many instances, their\r\nhatchability is so poor as to be hardly worth speaking of.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorning Largest Specialty Farm in World\r\n\r\nThe Corning Strain Single Comb White Leghorn is an egg machine, a large\r\nbird, of vigorous constitution, and typical Leghorn shape. The Corning\r\nEgg Farm is the largest poultry farm in the World devoted entirely and\r\nexclusively to one single purpose--the developing and breeding of the\r\ngreat egg machine, Corning Strain Single Comb White Leghorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoints That Mean Success\r\n\r\nJust to repeat in regular order the points a Breeder must observe if he\r\nis to make a permanent success:\r\n\r\nSuitable location for houses and runs.\r\n\r\nProperly planned, arranged and constructed houses.\r\n\r\nRight breeding stock.\r\n\r\nHatching eggs from a farm that has “made good.”\r\n\r\nCare in incubating and brooding.\r\n\r\nProper handling of the pullets and cockerels.\r\n\r\nCareful selection of breeders.\r\n\r\nRegularity in feeding and attending.\r\n\r\nProperly balanced ration.\r\n\r\nClean, sanitary quarters, fresh water, and pure air, all the time.\r\n\r\nConstant adherence to one Strain, and that the best Strain.\r\n\r\nBe jealous of your reputation, because it is on your reputation that\r\nyou build up a demand for breeding stock and eggs for hatching.\r\n\r\nCare, and courtesy, and regularity in serving customers.\r\n\r\nYou will know after reading this Book that on the Farm we have little\r\nidle time on our hands, and yet we are always willing to advise and\r\nhelp those who are really seriously seeking information, and who are\r\nwilling to accept what we may be able to give them, in addition to the\r\ncontents of this Book, and in our regular way of furnishing it.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS ON THE CORNING EGG FARM AND MANY HANDY DEVICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plans and drawings are of sufficient size to show quite clearly\r\nthe construction of every building on the Farm. Those who care to do so\r\nare entirely welcome to duplicate the entire Plant, or any part of it.\r\n\r\nAs the dimensions are also given, it is a simple matter to reduce\r\nthe size of the buildings to suit a flock of any number, because, as\r\nwe have made clear in the Book, the Corning Method and Buildings are\r\nequally suitable for the largest flock, or the few hens and a rooster\r\nkept by the average family.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to be thought egotistical, but believe we have the most\r\ncomplete and economically arranged lay-out in the country, but if any\r\nreader thinks he can point out improvements we shall be very glad to\r\nhear of them, and to discuss those that are worth while in some future\r\nedition of the Book.\r\n\r\nOf course it is easier to build from an architect’s plans, and we can\r\nfurnish working size blue-prints of the principal buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE CORNING BROODER HOUSE\r\n\r\nTotal length, 264 feet.
