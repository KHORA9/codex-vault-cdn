the Flames.—I determine on a voyage to Oceania.—I\r\n    charter a Chinese Junk, and find it manned by Pirates.—We\r\n    encounter a fearful Tempest.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born at Macao, in China, and am descended from one of those brave\r\nadventurers who, under the leadership of the celebrated Vasco de Gama,\r\nboldly left Lisbon, towards the end of the fifteenth century, to conquer\r\nthe Indies.\r\n\r\nIf I have good reason to congratulate myself on the accuracy of my\r\npedigree, I have, nevertheless, no plausible grounds for believing that I\r\nam descended from one of those sons of noble families who were attached\r\nby the sole tie of glory to their illustrious chief. My grandfather,\r\nit is true, used sometimes to say that our name of Marasquin was a\r\ncorruption of Marascarenhas, one of the greatest of names among those\r\nadventurous Portuguese who followed Vasco de Gama from the banks of the\r\nTagus to the end of Asia; but I have always had serious doubts upon this\r\nscore.\r\n\r\nMoreover, my worthy grandfather himself, Nicholas Marasquin, was to my\r\nknowledge never anything more than an industrious trader, established at\r\nMacao. My father, Juan Perez Marasquin, was pretty much the same. To him\r\nI owe this testimony—that the extent of his ambition, during a lifetime,\r\ntoo short, alas! to my great regret, was simply to pass for an honest\r\nman, a good Christian, and a loyal bird-fancier.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was his profession; I do not blush for it, although certain\r\npersons, through ignorance, or actuated by jealousy, have sought to\r\nreduce it to the level of a licensed dealer in game and poultry.\r\n\r\nEven without descending so low as this, it would still be very unfair to\r\nregard the bird-fancier’s profession—which, by the way, became in later\r\nyears my own—as restricted to the mere sale of birds, such as we know\r\nit ordinarily to be followed in Europe. My father possessed in his vast\r\nmenagerie one of the finest collections of which the Portuguese Indies\r\ncould boast, for it comprised not merely birds, but all kinds of rare and\r\ncurious animals. Sumatra, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, were all represented\r\nthere by specimens of some of the strangest and most exquisitely formed\r\ncreatures which inhabit in their native state the almost impenetrable\r\nforests of the eastern hemisphere. The profession of naturalist, when\r\nexercised on this scale, is really a very lucrative one, for the taste of\r\nthe European colonists, and the almost insane passion of the Chinese, for\r\nthese interesting products of nature, are matters of notoriety.\r\n\r\nTo his trade in living animals my father added the art and mystery of\r\nstuffing them when dead, which was not the least lucrative profession\r\nof the two. He had given me lessons in this learned and delicate art of\r\nrestoring to defunct birds and quadrupeds not alone the precise forms but\r\nthe very attitudes which they affected during lifetime. Thanks to the\r\ncounsels of so excellent a demonstrator, I acquired a remarkable skill in\r\ntaxidermy; and you will find further on, if you read through this account\r\nof my adventures, that I was indebted to this useful and beautiful\r\nscience for my escape from the tragical end which at one period menaced\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOur house had prospered for more than a century at Macao. My father, on\r\nsucceeding to the collection, added considerably to it, and thanks to the\r\nintelligent care of the good, economical, and devoted woman he espoused,\r\nhe managed to raise his establishment to the very highest position in\r\nthat particular branch of industry in which he was engaged.\r\n\r\nBut if this business yields, as I have already said, such rich rewards,\r\non the other hand it is attended not only with difficulties, but with\r\nperils as well, as I have had only too many opportunities of proving. It\r\nis carried on under conditions of which most people are ignorant. It is\r\nnot sufficient for a dealer in animals to purchase a bargain, and then to\r\nsell it again at a profit. It is requisite that he should go the length\r\nof procuring in a wild state those rarer kinds of animals which, when\r\nobtained, are certain to realise a good price. Hence the indispensable\r\nnecessity of being at once both merchant and hunter, or rather of being\r\nfirst of all hunter before becoming merchant.\r\n\r\nMy father used to go himself to hunt most of the animals in which he\r\ndealt—a laborious kind of occupation, which I, in my turn, learnt to\r\nfollow, whilst accompanying him on his expeditions—sometimes to the coast\r\nof China—sometimes to the jungles of the Isle of Hainan, so prolific\r\nin wild animals—sometimes as far as Japan, in spite of the obstacles\r\nand perils of a navigation bravely undertaken in barques of slender\r\nconstruction, spite of the Malay pirates—those veritable sharks, who\r\nswallow everything that crosses their path; and spite of the cruel\r\npunishments which used formerly to await those whom the Chinese and\r\nJapanese chanced to find trespassing on their sacred territories.\r\n\r\nMy father was in the habit of bringing back from those distant\r\nexpeditions—and later I had the satisfaction of bringing back with\r\nhim—panthers, tigers, boas, leopards, and, above all, innumerable\r\nvarieties of apes. It was during one of our last hunting expeditions in\r\nthe Island of Formosa that my father, assailed by a young tiger, which he\r\nwas on the point of enveloping in a net so as to capture it alive, had\r\nhalf a shoulder and a portion of a thigh carried off by a blow of the\r\nbrute’s paw. I had the gratification of defending him and protecting him\r\nfrom the further rage of the furious creature; and had, moreover, the\r\nsatisfaction of carrying him back with me to Macao, though I had not the\r\nhappiness of seeing him live. Badly tended by the doctors of the country,\r\nhe languished for a couple of years with wounds which they did not know\r\nhow to cicatrise, and died at length after undergoing the most frightful\r\nsufferings. Just before he drew his last breath in my arms, he begged of\r\nme not to continue in his profession. I promised him I would not; but as\r\nhe had left me nothing else to live upon and to support my poor mother,\r\nand as, to speak frankly, I had no taste for any other kind of pursuit, I\r\nwas compelled to break my promise. You will see from the tale which you\r\nare about to peruse the fearful punishment I brought upon myself by so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nI stuck, then, to my father’s business, and, in order to prove to the\r\nvaluable connection acquired by long years of good and loyal management\r\nhow anxious I was to carry it on with energy, I increased the number of\r\nmy examples of rare animals, and sent afar experienced hunters charged to\r\nbring back with them, to the latitudes of the Indies, specimens hitherto\r\nunknown. Being satisfied by long experience that luxury dazzled the eye,\r\nand consequently attracted the attention of buyers, I set to work to\r\nrenovate the interior of my bazaar. Bronze and gilding were had recourse\r\nto, to relieve the too apparent simplicity of my cages. An English\r\ncleanliness reigned throughout all parts of the establishment, which, in\r\nthe evening, I lighted up with gas, a dazzling novelty in those days for\r\nMacao.\r\n\r\nHere I ought to mention a singular trait in my character. I was\r\nremarkably fond of animals at first, by reason of my benevolent\r\norganisation; afterwards, as a natural result of the unremitting study\r\nwhich I had been obliged to make of their forms, features, movements,\r\ncustoms, manners, instincts, passions, and intelligence; their sympathies\r\nand antipathies; their caprices, maladies, and affinity, more or less\r\nexpressed with man, with a thousand other attributes essentially\r\nbelonging to their nature, which is perhaps still more obscure and\r\nmysterious than our own.\r\n\r\nI had pushed my observations so far on those particular beings with\r\nwhom it is now-a-days maintained we have a certain affinity, that I\r\ncould easily recognise among them those whose instinctive dispositions\r\ncorresponded in a measure with our own, and who would have become, for\r\nexample, barristers, if any such profession as that of the Bar existed\r\namongst apes, for they were always gesticulating, haranguing, and\r\narguing. I recognised again such as would have been doctors, among those\r\nwho were continually occupying themselves with the physical condition of\r\ntheir fellows, examining their tongues, their throats, and the inside of\r\ntheir eyes; others who would certainly have become comedians, for they\r\nwere perpetually making grimaces, and playing and dancing from morning\r\nto night; others again who would have made first-rate astronomers, for\r\nthey invariably arranged themselves so as to have the sun always shining\r\non the tips of their noses. I recognised, moreover, with a similar\r\ninfallibility, those who possessed a taste for commerce, apes who made a\r\npoint of collecting together all the fruit and corn which fell from the\r\nnegligent hands of their fellows, and of piling it up in a corner. In\r\nlike manner I distinguished the misers, the spendthrifts, the madcaps,\r\nthe bullies, the good fathers and mothers, the mothers given to flirting,\r\nand the incorrigibly bad sons; and particularly thieves of every shade,\r\nfrom the sharper moving in good society, who cheats at the card-table, to\r\nthe more daring robber who takes to the highway. I should have said of\r\nthe one, “Here is an ape who would loll in his carriage if he had only a\r\nwhite cravat;” of the other, that “he would be safe to be hung if he only\r\nhappened to wear a coat.”\r\n\r\nAs apes are far more saleable animals when their natural talent for\r\nimitation is developed by the aid of education, I made a point of putting\r\nmost of those in my collection through a course of instruction, the\r\nobject of which was to render them more attractive and engaging in the\r\neyes of intending purchasers. I taught them, for instance, to throw\r\nsomersaults, to jump through hoops, to dance, to play the tambourine, to\r\nmarch, to fence, and to salute in approved military style. Many among\r\nthem, I admit, were unwilling scholars, and chafed and fretted under the\r\ntuition they received; some so much so, indeed, that, as is commonly\r\nthe case with members of the human family, they could only be persuaded\r\nto prosecute their studies by the lively fear of a little wholesome\r\ncorrection. All this, however, arose simply from their not knowing so\r\nwell as I did what was really for their own advantage.\r\n\r\nSpite of the many little tiffs which arose between us in our several\r\ncapacities of master and scholars, I conceived, in my character of\r\nnaturalist, painter, doctor, philosopher, and instructor, far more\r\nthan in my character of merchant, a strong liking for my boarders. I\r\nsucceeded, by my powers of penetration, in reading in their eyes their\r\ndesires, wants, and thoughts, and almost ended by conversing with them.\r\nIn this psychological study I should, without doubt, have attained a\r\nheight unknown to the most skilful naturalists of our grand European\r\nmuseums, if the fatal accident through which my poor father lost his\r\nlife had not all at once put an end to my passion for animals. After\r\nthis unfortunate calamity it was impossible for me not to see in each\r\nanimal of my collection an accomplice of the tiger which had deprived my\r\nparent of existence. This antipathy, day by day growing stronger, caused\r\nme at first to neglect the brutes, and afterwards to punish them with\r\nfar more severity than I had hitherto been accustomed to exhibit towards\r\nthem. They soon perceived this, since animals have stronger instincts\r\nperhaps than men, and thereupon they repaid me with hatred and spite\r\nfor the rigour with which I ordinarily treated them. They became wicked\r\nand vindictive; and I, on my part, became only the more inflexible. A\r\nstruggle commenced between us, which was carried to a point when I was no\r\nlonger able to rule them except by threats and red-hot bars of iron.\r\n\r\nThis was the result; if, in order to punish and to tame them, I no longer\r\nallowed any one among them to leave his cage, I was obliged from motives\r\nof prudence to refrain from entering any of their dens. On both sides\r\nthere was a permanent state of anger and hostility, and I must say there\r\nwas no end to the wicked tricks they played me. The last one they were\r\nguilty of was of so cruel, and indeed terrible a character, that if I\r\nwere to pass it over in silence, the origin of my prodigious troubles\r\nwould be rendered in a great measure unintelligible. One alone was guilty\r\nof this deed, though all were in a degree parties to it by reason of\r\ntheir undisguised animosity towards me.\r\n\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell, who at that time was commander of the English\r\nnaval station in Oceania, was in the habit, every time he touched at\r\nMacao, of visiting my bazaar, and of making purchases for his aviaries\r\nand ship menageries of such things as parroquets, birds from the Island\r\nof Lugon, or tame tigers, which served to amuse him during his passage\r\nfrom one island to another, and throughout the long anchorages he was\r\noccasionally compelled to make up some wearisome and disagreeable inlet.\r\n\r\nI may here say a few words on the importance of the English stations\r\nin the Chinese and Australian seas. The object of these—which, by the\r\nway, is not always attained—is to protect the lives and properties of\r\nEuropeans from the descents of Chinese and Malay pirates, a numerous and\r\nterrible race. These formidable sea-serpents, who are to Oceania what\r\nthe Algerians were in former times to the Mediterranean, recognise no\r\nauthority under heaven—neither that of the Emperor of China, backed by\r\nhis mandarins; nor that of the sultans who reign over some few large\r\nislands, like Borneo and Mindanao; nor even that of the English and Dutch\r\nviceroys, representatives of powerful nations, it is true, but who find\r\nconsiderable difficulty in making their flags respected in these distant\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe Malay pirates may be said to brave everything, and to be everywhere.\r\nThe archipelago of Sooloo, which contains no less than 160 islands, is\r\nentirely peopled by them. At an appointed time they will sail forth over\r\nthe waters with a fleet of, perhaps, 500 junks, manned by 5,000 sailors,\r\nand lie in ambuscade for unsuspecting merchantmen. The booty which\r\nthey secure they divide among themselves; and the prisoners whom they\r\ntake are only set at liberty on the receipt of a considerable ransom:\r\ntoo frequently they are killed. These water-rats have sometimes pushed\r\ntheir audacity so far as to make descents in the very midst of such\r\ngreat centres of commerce as the islands of Sumatra and Java; and on\r\none occasion they even dared to come and buy powder and ball at Macao.\r\nWhat is quite as remarkable, too, the merchants of this place did not\r\nhesitate a moment to sell them all the ammunition they required: in this\r\nrespect reminding one of those mercenary Dutchmen who, when besieged\r\nby the Spaniards, made a practice each evening of selling to their\r\nadversaries—no doubt at remunerative prices—the cannon-balls which they\r\nhad fired against their town during the day. These pirates are apparently\r\nindestructible; they have lasted for centuries as it is, and they bid\r\nfair to last for centuries more.\r\n\r\nIt is to protect its subjects against the poisoned daggers of these\r\nswarming bandits that England, as I have mentioned above, is constantly\r\nsending forth ships to innumerable points on the sea-coast of China, and\r\nto the interminable shores scattered round about.\r\n\r\nThese vessels often remain for entire years in localities which are\r\nbelieved to be menaced with a visit from these formidable corsairs. It is\r\nthen that the officers take up their quarters on shore, that tents are\r\npitched, and houses even are constructed, where naval men can manage to\r\nlodge in something like comfort.\r\n\r\nThis particular kind of naval campaign is much dreaded by the English\r\nsailors, obliged to contend at the same time against tempests,\r\npirates, and fevers of every kind and colour; and, above all, with the\r\nwearisomeness arising from the monotonous kind of life they are here\r\nforced to lead, and which may be described as the yellow fever of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell, who commanded, as I have already said, at one of\r\nthese stations, had hoisted his pennant on board Her Majesty’s steam\r\nfrigate Halcyon.\r\n\r\nThe admiral was preparing to leave the roads of Macao on the very day\r\nthat he came with all his staff—captains, lieutenants, commanders, and\r\nofficers of every grade—to view my menagerie. Some of these gentlemen had\r\nbrought their wives with them, whence I concluded that their stay at the\r\nstation to which they were about to proceed would be an unusually long\r\none.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I had received a short time previously some considerable\r\nadditions to my stock of animals; and I can truly say that my\r\nestablishment at this time was alike worthy of the attention of men of\r\nscience and of amateurs. Besides birds from every clime, which enriched\r\nmy aviaries, I possessed gazelles from Egypt, bisons from Missouri, goats\r\nfrom Cashmere, ant-eaters, jaguars, leopards from Senegambia, otters,\r\npolar bears, black panthers, lynxes, moose-deer from Canada, rhinoceroses\r\nwith one horn, llamas from Brazil, lions from Bengal, and a magnificent\r\nselection of tigers. But the cream of my collection was its endless\r\nvariety of apes: waggish, wicked, shy, wild, grave, pensive, sinister,\r\nintellectual, stupid, melancholy, and grotesque. I had ourang-outangs,\r\ngibbons, baboons, papios, mandrills, wanderoos, monkeys, macaques, patas\r\nmonkeys, malbroncks, mangabeys, lemurs, talapoins, cluks, and magots. Of\r\nall these apes, there were four that seemed to divide among themselves\r\nthe curiosity of the large party at that moment assembled in my museum.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there were two baboons of unequalled strength and ferocity—as\r\nlarge as men, as intelligent as men, and, I was about to add, as wicked\r\nas men. They made their cage shake again with their violent movements,\r\nthey often turned it over even; and, in an excess of anger, would twist\r\nthe iron bars through which they made a point of insulting every one that\r\nstopped to gaze at them, as though these stout metal rods were so many\r\nsticks of pliant wax. How was it that visitors generally were so pleased\r\nwith them? Could it have been because they were so supremely wicked? I am\r\nhalf afraid that this was the reason.\r\n\r\nThe two other apes who divided the sympathies of the visitors with the\r\nbig baboons were a male and female chimpanzee, both possessing youth,\r\nand, I may add, even grace. The male chimpanzee was gentle as a young\r\ngirl, delicate, sensible, understanding everything, approaching as near\r\nthe limits of intelligence as is permitted to a being deprived of the\r\nDivine light of reason. He was fond of children, played with them, and\r\nappeared to have a taste for music, since he invariably left off eating\r\nwhenever he heard the sounds of an instrument.\r\n\r\nWith me he filled the office of a footman. At dinner he held the plates,\r\nand handed round the wine; he even ate at table when I invited him. The\r\ntrifling marks of attention which I occasionally paid him made the other\r\napes jealous, almost to frenzy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to his companion, who was likewise a young chimpanzee, she\r\ndiffered from most female apes, who are fond of ribbons, lace, and\r\nembroidered handkerchiefs, and appeared perfectly contented with her own\r\nnatural grace and prettiness. She was never so happy as when some one\r\ngave her a beautiful flower, which she would either place behind her ear,\r\nor else regard with looks of melancholy for entire hours.\r\n\r\nI had named my two baboons, the one Karabouffi the First, the other\r\nKarabouffi the Second; and I had given to the male chimpanzee the name of\r\nMococo, and to the female that of Saïmira.\r\n\r\nMococo loved Saïmira very much; and it is quite certain that Saïmira on\r\nher part loved Mococo in return.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi the First had also a hidden and terrible love for Saïmira.\r\nNothing could exceed the black jealousy of this ferocious baboon.\r\nWhenever the two young chimpanzees, who enjoyed the liberty of\r\nperambulating the galleries of the museum, passed in front of his cage,\r\nhis terrible claws became rigid as iron hooks, his eyes flashed forth\r\nangry and vindictive glances, as he curled up his blue lips, and gnashed\r\nhis teeth. On these occasions terror reigned throughout the menagerie,\r\nand even the lions and tigers seemed lost in reflection.\r\n\r\nThere was not a single one of these animals that did not at times recall\r\nto me, point by point, the characters, desires, and passions of men. I\r\nbecame convinced with Buffon, who has written so many admirable pages on\r\nnatural history, that if, instead of beating and ill-treating them and\r\nmaking them constantly suffer, we were only to study them, and take a\r\nreal and active interest in such an occupation, we should penetrate an\r\nimmense and unexplored world of ideas and sensations, where as yet we\r\ncan be hardly said to have placed our feet.\r\n\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell was so delighted with the grimaces, the tricks, the\r\neccentricities, and I must also add the ferocity, of my boarders, that he\r\nimmediately purchased an ape and a monkey. Whereupon every officer, out\r\nof deference to his superior, selected in like manner an ape and a monkey.\r\n\r\nI confess I could not bring myself to part with Mococo and Saïmira,\r\nfor it was necessary to sell both or to keep both; but Vice-Admiral\r\nCampbell’s lady wished so much to possess them, that I had no alternative\r\nexcept to resign them to her. I knew, moreover, that she would take as\r\nmuch care of them as I myself had been in the habit of; nevertheless, I\r\nasked her to promise me never to leave them in the power of their prime\r\npersecutor, Karabouffi the First. She gave me her word, and I abandoned\r\nmy two young chimpanzees with confidence to her keeping. The poor things\r\nappeared even more afflicted than myself at our separation, for they\r\nembraced me like two children, and moistened my hands with their tears.\r\nOvercome by these marks of affection, I was on the point of taking them\r\nback again; but I recollected that I was a trader, and that a trader must\r\nsell the wares in which he deals: interest therefore had its way.\r\n\r\nAs all the gentlemen belonging to the station bought, as I think I have\r\nalready said, my animals in pairs, it happened that, owing to my having\r\nan odd ape, one of the two baboons, Karabouffi the Second, was left on my\r\nhands. For want of a female to pair with him, he was condemned to remain\r\nin the menagerie, a circumstance which irritated him to that degree as to\r\ncause him to utter shrieks of rage on seeing his companions about to be\r\ntaken away while he alone was to be left behind.\r\n\r\nHis companions in their turn, pitying the lot of their unfortunate\r\ncomrade who remained a captive behind the iron bars, uttered the most\r\nplaintive cries, and sought to prevent themselves from being conveyed\r\non board the vessels which were to carry them to the distant station. It\r\nbecame necessary, therefore, to have recourse to the whip.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, all Macao was in commotion at the event. However, the\r\nlaw was strong, and the whole of the apes were eventually embarked.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give an idea, either by the aid of language or\r\nof painting, of the dark and revengeful looks which the solitary baboon\r\ndirected towards me when I re-entered the menagerie after his companions’\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nI question whether the most irritated and malignant of men, burning with\r\nfeelings of suppressed hatred, ever condensed such unmistakable threats\r\nof vengeance into his eyes as I could read in those of the infuriated\r\nbaboon. I saw there a positive hankering after blood, and that blood,\r\nmoreover, my own.\r\n\r\nNearly a year had elapsed since this extensive sale of apes, on which\r\nI had, as the reader may suppose, realised enormous profits, when one\r\nnight I woke up suffocated by a dense smoke which seemed to rise from the\r\ncrevices in the floor of my room. This flooring, which was composed of\r\nvery thin boards, extended above the menagerie. I found myself positively\r\nchoking, and rose from my bed with infinite difficulty, and directed\r\nmy steps towards the window, which I immediately flung open. Indeed, I\r\nopened every window and door so as not to perish of suffocation. But\r\ndirectly the air had penetrated into the apartment, it was no longer\r\nsmoke that I had to contend with, but fire, which, running along the\r\ncracks of the floor, enveloped ere long the whole house in a blaze.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to save my poor mother, but I was, alas! too late.\r\nThe back part of the house, where her room was situated, was the first\r\nto be filled with smoke, and my poor mother must have been suffocated\r\nbefore she could call out for assistance. For myself, I was dragged from\r\nthe room where I wished to die. My neighbours saved me, carried me into\r\nthe street, and placed me on a stone bench, from whence I saw my entire\r\nestablishment consumed before my eyes. Through the broken door, through\r\nthe open entrance of the bazaar, I was a witness of a spectacle which I\r\nshall never forget.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the devouring flames, which were roasting my finest\r\nbirds, and in which my superb tigers were writhing with fearful cries,\r\nnobody meanwhile daring to approach near enough to attempt to rescue\r\nthem, the baboon, a lighted brand in each hand, danced, chuckled,\r\ngrinned, and frisked about with a hideous kind of joy. His attitude,\r\nhis impudent looks, indeed everything about his frightful expression,\r\nsufficiently proved him to be the author of the conflagration—he who, in\r\nthe course of a long-meditated night of vengeance, had managed to procure\r\nsome matches with which he had seen the keeper of an evening light up the\r\nbazaar; he who, breaking his chains and the bars of his cage, had first\r\nturned on the gas, and after allowing it to escape had then set light to\r\nit. Such was the supreme vengeance of this terrible baboon, Karabouffi\r\nthe Second.\r\n\r\nOne of my neighbours shot him as he was dancing in the midst of the\r\nflames. But I was not the less ruined; I had not the less lost my\r\nexcellent mother.\r\n\r\nUnder the weight of so many afflictions, and so much misery, I resolved\r\nto change my profession; remembering rather late my poor father’s\r\nadmonition. For more than two years I traded in ivory, feathers, and\r\nfurs; but not being versed in this kind of traffic, I made only moderate\r\nprofits, and entertained no hope whatever of realising any very great\r\nones in future. Moreover, this mode of life, less active than what I had\r\nbeen accustomed to, did not please me; my former pursuit was continually\r\nrecalled to my mind by the enticing nature of my studies in natural\r\nhistory. I regretted it even for the dangers with which it was beset, and\r\nof which I have already spoken. At last, after a good deal of hesitation,\r\nI determined to follow it again. I was still young; several thousand\r\npiastres were lying to my credit with M. Silvao, banker at Goa. I had\r\nthe means of re-establishing my business; but it was necessary for me to\r\nundertake two or three journeys to the islands of Oceania, and join the\r\ngreat hunters of wild beasts and birds of prey, with whom I counted upon\r\nscouring the woods and swamps. It was a hardy and adventurous course to\r\nfollow; still there was no other way of re-stocking my establishment at\r\nMacao. I hesitated for a time, I admit; but after awhile I took leave of\r\nmy few relations and my numerous friends, and made the final preparations\r\nfor my voyage. I ought not to omit to say that I had chartered a Chinese\r\njunk on my own account, and that I had it at my service for an entire\r\nyear. My first destination was Australia, that immense island, as large\r\nas a continent, where I was certain, according to the accounts of\r\ntravellers, to find some of the most varied and least known animals of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nI set sail on the 3rd of July, 1850, in the junk which I had chartered,\r\nand which did not make up for its great weight by any unusual strength.\r\nIt was an old tub of a thing, none the better for its numerous voyages to\r\nCorea and Japan. Formerly it had been able to resist bad weather, but,\r\nfor all that, it could only boast at the present time of somewhat shaky\r\nribs and planks, scarcely to be relied on in rough weather, for anything\r\nthat Master Ming-Ming, its very indulgent captain, might say.\r\n\r\nMy first point of debarkation being New Holland or Australia, we steered\r\ndirect south on quitting Macao.\r\n\r\nFor eight days we were favoured by a wind which carried us straight\r\nin this direction. So we soon found ourselves in the midst of the\r\narchipelago of the Philippines, spite of the want of agreement prevailing\r\namong the crew, which was composed of eight Chinese, eight Malays, and\r\neight Portuguese, three nations holding each other in the greatest\r\npossible aversion, detesting one another as much as the Genoese formerly\r\ndetested the Corsicans, and the Corsicans the Genoese, and settling all\r\ndisputes by the arbitration of the knife.\r\n\r\nWhile passing the Island of Mindanao, and at the moment of entering the\r\nSea of Celebes, we sprung a leak, and as if to make up for the fine\r\nweather we had already enjoyed, the sky became overcast, and squalls\r\nbegan to blow from every point of the compass.\r\n\r\nThroughout ten entire days we endeavoured to pass the Straits of\r\nMindanao. The wind and currents, however, always drove us towards the\r\nwest, and the greater the efforts which we made to resist this deviation\r\nfrom our course the more the leak in the junk increased.\r\n\r\nTo aggravate our position in the midst of a sea of itself sufficiently\r\ndangerous, the crew refused to work at pumping out the water which was\r\ngaining on us every hour. Chinese, Malays, and Portuguese alike refused\r\nto perform this task as being too laborious for them; laborious it may\r\nhave been, but on it, nevertheless, the safety of all depended.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ming-Ming, I could only too plainly see, had no power whatever\r\nover his incongruous crew; I even suspected him of having formerly\r\nexercised the profession of pirate in company with the eight Malays,\r\nwho placed him on a footing of such perfect equality as unmistakably\r\nindicated the bonds of an old and equivocal fraternity, and deprived him\r\nof any kind of authority over them. The discovery was not very assuring\r\nfor me, who knew so well, as I have already explained, the utterly savage\r\ncharacter of these untamable brigands. This revelation, I confess,\r\nstartled me; I nevertheless dissembled my fears, but took the precaution\r\nof loading a couple of pistols, and placing one in each of my two side\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nThe crew would not work at the pumps, and the water was continually\r\nrising in the hold. Not by any means such good sailors as the Chinese and\r\nMalays, the Portuguese portion of the crew became alarmed at the fate\r\nwhich evidently threatened us, and proposed to make for some port. This\r\nthe Malays and Chinese opposed, and their will carried the question,\r\nwhich only helped to confirm me in my suspicions of their former\r\ncharacter, as they evidently did not wish to show themselves in any port\r\nwhich boasted of a regular police.\r\n\r\nMoreover, what port should we make for? In the first place, where were\r\nwe? Were we above or below the Equator? Were we sailing along the Strait\r\nof the Moluccas or of Macassar?\r\n\r\nMaster Ming-Ming, more learned in the art of smoking opium than in that\r\nof navigating a vessel, was not the man to have informed us. The sky was\r\nblack, the wind blew our great bamboo sails into shreds, and the waves\r\nseemed as though they would engulf us.\r\n\r\nWhen it was no longer possible to overcome the danger which had now\r\nbecome most imminent, this confused medley crew began one and all to\r\nchange their minds. The instinct of preservation awoke within them when\r\nit was too late. They attempted to clear the water out of the junk;\r\nbut the pumps would no longer act. Fear then took possession of these\r\nbandits, every one of whom, Malays, Portuguese, and Chinese, greedily\r\nsought land on the horizon, although the chance was that they would be\r\nhung as pirates as soon as they set foot on shore. During this anxious\r\ntime I could do nothing beyond looking to the preservation from sea water\r\nof my good arms, my nets, and the various traps with which I had left\r\nMacao, in the hope of replenishing my menagerie. Alas! what was the use\r\nof all these precautions? Was I destined to escape myself from my present\r\ncritical position?\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth day of our voyage, there was no other course left\r\nus but to abandon ourselves to the discretion of the tempest. Master\r\nMing-Ming therefore left the junk to itself. I don’t think, although I\r\nhave seen many hurricanes on the coasts of Japan, whilst sailing with my\r\nfather, that the winds and waves were ever so frightfully disturbed as\r\nthey were on this occasion. The old junk bounded on the crest of the sea\r\nlike an elastic ball on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter three days passed between life and death, we perceived a point\r\nblack as ink, standing out from the lurid sky on the horizon. The Malays,\r\nwhose eyes have an infallible power of penetration, affirmed that it\r\nwas land. We sped along with all the violence of a hurricane. The night\r\nhaving almost immediately supervened, we had not time to calculate if,\r\nwhen the light of day re-appeared, we should have reached or passed this\r\nwished-for land. And what a night it was for us, with neither sails, nor\r\nmasts, nor rudder, with the wind blowing great guns, and the junk seeming\r\nas though it were splitting in pieces on every side!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    We are Shipwrecked.—I alone escape.—I find myself on an unknown\r\n    island.—A strange form appears to me and vanishes.—A deluge of\r\n    Apes.—I am cudgelled with a rattan cane.—Am saved at length by\r\n    my cravat.—I am parched with thirst.—I discover water.—Four\r\n    thousand of us drink in company.—Ingenious way of procuring\r\n    fruit from the top of a tall tree.—Two valets-de-chambre, such\r\n    as are seldom seen in Europe.—I miraculously escape their care.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the day broke, and we saw land only a quarter of a mile distant.\r\nBut this quarter of a mile was only a chain of shoals white with foam\r\nfrom the sea incessantly breaking over them. It was inevitable that ere\r\nmany minutes elapsed poor crazy junk would break itself as the sea was\r\ndoing on the rocks, covered with foam and bearded with patches of slimy\r\nsea-weed, which lay direct in our course. We had no time to reflect on\r\nthe fate which awaited us. Two sudden and frightful concussions, two\r\nblows of the heel, to use sailor’s language, shattered the ribs of the\r\npoor junk, whose poop at the same time was carried away by a terrible\r\nsea, and with it five of the crew. We scarcely heard the cries which they\r\nuttered as they disappeared in the watery abyss.\r\n\r\nThe other sailors at once sought to possess themselves of the only boat\r\nwe had, in order, if possible, to reach the land. They had, however, no\r\nsooner commenced lowering it than a frightful struggle arose as to who\r\nshould occupy it. It would scarcely have held more than half-a-dozen\r\npersons, and there were fifteen desperate men eager to fill it. Knives\r\nwere drawn. A cutting of throats commenced; but the theatre of the\r\nstruggle was about to disappear beneath the feet of conquerors and\r\nconquered alike.\r\n\r\nHaving kept clear of this desperate struggle for the possession of the\r\nboat, I caught sight at this moment of danger of one of those buoys\r\nfastened by a rope to the cable of the anchor, and which serves to mark\r\nthe exact point where the anchor has been let go. I at once pull out my\r\nknife and cut the rope at a certain distance from the cable, and then\r\nseizing the buoy in both my arms, threw myself with it into the midst of\r\nthe hissing waves. Engulfed an instant beneath the surge, on rising again\r\nto the surface, I turn my head to see what has become of my companions.\r\nThey and the last remains of the junk have disappeared!\r\n\r\nFor three hours I fought with death. What agony I suffered! Every time\r\nI endeavoured to hook myself on as it were to the branches of coral\r\nwhich projected above the waves, I was driven back by the surf: and my\r\ngory hands let go of their painful support. My strength failed me; I had\r\nscarcely sufficient left to seize the rope attached to the buoy. I had\r\nlost all energy, and almost the desire for existence, when a last wave\r\nenveloped me, and carried me with my buoy to the bottom of the sea. I\r\nfelt myself getting weaker and weaker, then I became cold, and recollect\r\nnothing more.\r\n\r\nWhen I re-opened my eyes I found myself lying extended on a shore covered\r\nwith sea-weed and marine plants. I fancied too that trees were not far\r\ndistant. My astonishment was that of a person waking from a trance—I\r\nhadn’t strength enough to rise. The storm no longer raged. The sun,\r\nwhich appeared to my still weak sight to have attained a certain height\r\nin the heavens, spread a general glow around, and the sand grew warm\r\nbeneath my touch. By degrees the sensation of life returned to me. I\r\nsought for myself, I asked myself if it were really I, and whereabouts I\r\nwas; I saw for certainty that there were trees—in fact a forest at some\r\nlittle distance off. My lethargy passed away like a fleeting cloud, and\r\nI endeavoured to rise and walk a few steps; but my legs bent under me.\r\nNevertheless I held myself upright. The sun, which had risen still higher\r\nin the heavens, now shone down almost perpendicularly on the ground. The\r\nheat diffused throughout the air was so intense that I fell faint and\r\nexhausted at the foot of a palm-tree whose cool and refreshing shade\r\nserved to revive me.\r\n\r\nGradually my eyes grew heavy, and I fell fast asleep. I do not know how\r\nlong I remained plunged in this second and more refreshing lethargy; but\r\nwhen I awoke, I judged by the position of the sun that it was afternoon.\r\nFrom the degree of comfort which I felt, I concluded that I must have\r\nslept altogether something like eight hours. I can, however, say nothing\r\npositive on this score, my watch having stopped from the various shocks\r\nmy whole body had received since the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nIn order to dissipate the heaviness which held possession of my senses\r\nafter this prolonged sleep, I rose and took a few rapid steps straight\r\nbefore me. I had scarcely proceeded twenty yards in a direction\r\nimmediately opposite to the sea, when I caught sight of something like\r\na human form at the end of a long avenue of trees. Naturally enough, my\r\nfirst impression was that this must be some inhabitant of the island on\r\nwhich I had been cast by my unlucky shipwreck. I was already rejoicing\r\nat the discovery, though, I must confess, not without a certain amount\r\nof inquietude as to the possible nature of the companion whom fortune\r\nhad sent me. I walked straight in the direction in which I had first\r\nseen him; but, to my intense surprise, after the lapse of five or six\r\nminutes, I failed in encountering him, or even in discovering what had\r\nbecome of him. Had my eyes deceived me? Had the numerous mirages of the\r\nsun assisted to produce some kind of hallucination? I knew not how to\r\nexplain the affair, which left upon me a certain disagreeable impression.\r\nNevertheless I continued to walk on.\r\n\r\nI had proceeded no very great distance, when all at once another view\r\nopened to my sight; and, to my intense satisfaction, I again saw the\r\nfigure which I had observed a few minutes previously. Ah! how truly happy\r\nI felt at this second discovery! I could manage to distinguish him far\r\nmore clearly than I had done before, although the distance between us\r\nwas very much greater. I watched him with the utmost attention, and was\r\nsurprised to find how excessively quick and lively all his movements\r\nwere. He was continually disappearing and appearing again, passing\r\nas quick as lightning from one point to another. After a time I felt\r\nconvinced that he had seen me, and that he was afraid. I thereupon\r\nadvanced towards him with increased boldness, and had just arrived at\r\nthe spot where I had last seen him, when something—indefinable at the\r\nfirst glance, a kind of hairy and sinewy form, uttering noisy, guttural,\r\nand savage cries, which were taken up and repeated by the many echoes\r\naround—suddenly descended from the top of a tree, almost at my very feet.\r\nIt was an ape. With one bound he mounted the tree again, then sprang\r\ndown, and ended by placing himself immediately in my path, as though to\r\nprevent me from proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis pretension on his part was not at all to my mind; I therefore broke\r\noff the first branch of a tree which I could manage to reach with my\r\nhand—it was, I believe, a small stick of cane—and threatened the animal\r\nwith it. My action evidently displeased him. At a second cry, which\r\nhe uttered as a call, judge of my consternation to see rushing from\r\nthe four points of the compass, through the openings in the forest,\r\nclouds upon clouds of apes, of all forms, colours, and sizes, who in an\r\ninstant, clambering up the trees, rolling themselves among the branches\r\nlike squirrels, or taking possession of the ground about me, proceeded\r\nto regard me with quick and menacing glances, and to overwhelm me with\r\nhissing cries, and gnashings of the teeth, so fierce, so noisy, so\r\npositively deafening, that I became quite dizzy and bewildered. I was\r\ncompelled to clap my hands over my ears, so as not to lose all sense of\r\nconsciousness in the midst of this infernal commotion. Nothing like it, I\r\nbelieve, had ever been heard before in the forests of Oceania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clouds upon clouds of apes, of all forms, colours, and\r\nsizes, clambering up the trees, rolling themselves among the branches\r\nlike squirrels, or taking possession of the ground about me.—_Page 30._]\r\n\r\nMy Macao experience with regard to apes was not lost upon me at this\r\nsupreme moment. In spite of my trouble, and of the danger with which I\r\nwas menaced, I managed to recognise, without difficulty, the different\r\nkinds of apes in which I had formerly dealt. I noticed the duks, with\r\ntheir long tails, smooth faces, black feet, and red ears; the wanderoos,\r\nsuch troublesome fellows that they are obliged to be kept in iron cages;\r\nlowandos, with hairless flesh-coloured faces, and all the rest of their\r\nbodies as black as their noses, possessing long claws, and having on\r\ntheir heads large wigs of grisly, bushy, compact hair. I saw monkeys\r\nwith purple faces, and with violet hands, trailing behind them tails\r\nterminating in white tufts of hair; capuchins, covered with a flowing\r\ndown of a yellowish black tint, which serves them for a kind of hood;\r\nmonas, with white bellies and wide open eyes surrounded with circles,\r\nblack as their feet, hands, and wrists; then coaïtas, or spider monkeys,\r\nwith tails that they can turn to much the same purposes as the elephant\r\ndoes his proboscis; then black-crested simpias; then ourang-outangs;\r\nthen hundreds of mangabeys, monkeys with long tails, and known as apes\r\nof Madagascar. I recognised them by their naked eyelids, their striking\r\nwhiteness, their long grey muzzles, and their eyebrows of coarse and\r\nbushy hair. In the same way I recognised the gloomy macaques, the\r\nturbulent pinches, the malbroncks, and the pig-tailed macaques, which\r\ngambolled, frolicked, danced, kicked, stamped, capered, and wheeled about\r\non every side. Hundreds and hundreds more pressed forward to catch sight\r\nof me, but they were too far off for me to distinguish them, as I had\r\ndone those of whom I have just spoken.\r\n\r\nKnowing by experience the thoroughly wicked nature of these animals when\r\ncongregated together, I resolved to beat a retreat. I was, however,\r\ntoo late. On all sides of me were closely-packed ranks of apes, some\r\nof whom seemed possessed of such strength, that any attempt at flight\r\nwould have been a grave imprudence on my part. I remained, therefore,\r\nperfectly still, but not without some little anxiety. Suddenly, all\r\nthese apes which encircled me round about, commenced to sway to and\r\nfro, making at the same time the most hostile demonstrations, although\r\nI no longer held in my hand the unlucky cane branch, the original cause\r\nof their furious irritation. That I might bear with patience this\r\nopposition, which I was most anxious not to increase (thinking that\r\nif I were permitted to proceed towards the interior of the island,\r\nsome inhabitant, friend or enemy, civilised or savage, might rescue\r\nme from these insulting occupants of the woods), I amused myself by\r\nrecalling to mind the wearisomeness of the dull tints which overpower\r\nthe traveller on his arrival in the first commercial, and the most\r\ndensely-populated city in the world, that “province covered with houses”\r\ncalled London, the thousand custom-house officers—honourable persons\r\nenough, whom I should be very sorry to compare with apes, though they\r\nare also at times equally tyrannical—that one meets with on landing.\r\nI turned from one reminiscence of the kind to another, until I found\r\nmyself recalling how on a particular day, on my arrival at Calcutta, the\r\nofficers at the custom-house pierced with their iron gauge-rod a packet\r\nof twenty Cashmere shawls, which were completely spoiled; but on which,\r\nnevertheless, I was required to pay duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quick as lightning, he seized the branch of cane which\r\nI had thrown on the ground, and before I had time to place myself in a\r\nposture of defence, showered blow after blow on my arms and legs.—_Page\r\n33._]\r\n\r\nAfter a time, finding the heat, striking on the open spot where I was\r\nstanding, somewhat oppressive, I endeavoured, while the disposition of\r\nmy guards seemed a trifle more to my advantage, to take a few steps in\r\nadvance. I was, in fact, frightfully hungry, and my lips were parched\r\nwith thirst. No sooner, however, had I prepared to change my position\r\nthan all these groups of importunate apes, gathering more closely around\r\nme, recommenced their cries and their menaces. They did more, they formed\r\na square; and when they had taken up this strategical position, of which\r\nI occupied the centre, one of them, leaving the ranks, advanced towards\r\nme. Quick as lightning he seized the branch of cane which I had thrown\r\non the ground; and, before I had time to place myself in a posture of\r\ndefence, showered blow after blow on my arms and legs, my feet and\r\nhands, my face and head, and on my back and sides. These blows followed\r\none another in such rapid succession that, not being able to run away,\r\nI commenced bounding about, jumping as though there were blazing coals\r\nbeneath my feet.\r\n\r\nI candidly confess that I suffered quite as much shame as pain. A vile\r\nape was belabouring me, an abominable brute was taking upon himself to\r\nadminister correction to me in broad daylight! Other miserable apes,\r\nwitnesses of my moral degradation, were making grimaces and grinning at\r\nme, and showing their enjoyment by capering about. It was whilst I thus\r\nperformed a part in a comedy before their eyes, and they furnished me\r\nan occasion of observing them more closely, that I was seized with a\r\nsingular idea; but the trouble I was in prevented me from following it\r\nup. Ah! my position was indeed a painful one, to be thrashed by an ape\r\nbefore an assembly of apes! It is only animals who can introduce such\r\na degree of refinement into cruelty. I know very well that at London,\r\nwhich has the reputation of being an extremely civilised city, people are\r\nready to crush one another to death, when a criminal is hanged before the\r\ndoor of Newgate; and that in Paris, people pay equally dear for places\r\nto see a man executed; that it is the same at Brussels, Vienna, and\r\nBerlin—nevertheless, spite of the attractions which an execution offers,\r\nwe neither hang nor decapitate apes; and the right which these animals\r\narrogated to themselves of cudgelling me, appeared to me to be founded\r\nneither in reason nor in justice. For the moment they were of course the\r\nstronger, and it was necessary that I should give in to them; and I did\r\ngive in. But it was melancholy to feel that there appeared to be no end\r\nto this punishment; my tormentor never once relaxed his exertions, to\r\ntake even a moment’s rest; but continued laying on his blows, as though\r\nhe would never tire.\r\n\r\nCertainly, with one of the two pistols which I had about me, and which I\r\nhad been prudent enough not to part with, I could easily have shot the\r\nimpudent beast through the head; but I remembered too well the accident\r\nwhich happened to a certain president of the French East India Company,\r\nto attempt any such thing. One day, when the celebrated French traveller\r\nTavernier accompanied the president on an excursion through some great\r\nforest on the banks of the Ganges, the latter, being astounded at the\r\nimmense number of apes which he saw, and which suddenly surrounded\r\nhim just as they had surrounded me, stopped his carriage, and desired\r\nTavernier to knock two or three of them over. The servants, knowing\r\nvery well the vindictive dispositions of these animals, begged of the\r\npresident not to meddle with them. He, however, insisted, and Tavernier\r\nfired, and killed a female with her young. At that very instant the other\r\napes threw themselves, with cries of rage and despair, on the president’s\r\ncarriage. They knocked over the coachman, the footmen, and the horses,\r\nand would have strangled his lordship—torn him to pieces, indeed—if the\r\nwindows of the carriage had not been promptly closed, and the members of\r\nhis suite had not engaged in a regular fight with their assailants, from\r\nwhom they only escaped with an infinite deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of the danger which menaced them restrained me from\r\ndischarging my weapon at the horrible animal, who still continued his\r\nblows, spite of my ill-concealed rage, and the efforts which I made to\r\nprotect myself, Alas! I could do nothing. I was thrashed by him till the\r\nblood flowed from me and saturated my garments. I should have assuredly\r\nsunk under the constant succession of blows meted out to me, since the\r\ncunning and wickedness of these animals went so far as to induce them to\r\nvolunteer to relieve my tormentor, when he at length felt fatigued with\r\nhis exertions; yes, I should certainly have fallen a victim to their\r\nbrutality, but for an idea, a really admirable idea, which occurred to\r\nme; but which, unfortunately, like all excellent ideas, came very late.\r\nThe increased pain which I endured evidently freshened up my memory;\r\nand, all of a sudden, it struck me that I had heard of travellers, who\r\nfound themselves in the same predicament as myself, escaping by means of\r\na ruse, which ruse I resolved for my part at once to employ. I therefore\r\nproceeded to untie my cravat (a superb cravat, bought in Bengal the\r\npreceding year), and, unfolding it, threw it among the crowd of apes,\r\nwho no sooner caught sight of my bright red neckerchief than they rushed\r\nforward in a body to seize it, with loud chatterings, and other signs of\r\ncuriosity and delight. My tormentor followed the example of his fellows;\r\nand, whilst they disputed among themselves the possession of the spoil\r\nwhich I had resigned to them, I ran off, with all possible speed, towards\r\nthe interior of the island, where I reckoned on meeting with some of the\r\ninhabitants, and certainly on procuring a little water, to quench my\r\nintolerable thirst. After a breathless run of five or six hundred yards\r\nI looked back, and had the satisfaction of finding that none of the apes\r\nwere following me. For an entire hour I continued to run in this manner\r\nover a tract of soft sand, through groups of trees entwined together, and\r\nforming bright masses of foliage of various colours, and which by-and-by\r\nbowed down to the earth, indicating a hollow where I might possibly find\r\nwater. I was thoroughly fatigued, I was in a burning heat. Was I about to\r\ndiscover the water I so ardently longed for?\r\n\r\nOn rounding a hill covered with a whitish green moss, I was suddenly\r\nstruck by the sight of a lake upwards of a mile in length, bordered by\r\ntall trees, ranged in a series of terraces, as though they had been\r\nplanted thus by a professor of landscape gardening. A slight descent,\r\nalong the same soft silvery turf which I had just now passed over,\r\nconducted me to the brink of a clear, sparkling sheet of water. I knelt\r\ndown to drink, and, placing my parched lips in it, my ecstasy was so\r\ncomplete that I prolonged it for nearly a quarter of an hour, partaking\r\nat intervals of draught after draught of the reviving delicacy.\r\n\r\nMy enjoyment was like a dream, it was so concentrated and so tranquil.\r\nBut the cry which escaped me on raising my head, was not altogether one\r\nof gratitude towards Heaven, to whom I owed the delicious joy of having\r\nbeen enabled thus to refresh myself. Intense surprise had something to do\r\nwith my exclamation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The banks of the lake were covered along their entire\r\nlength by those very apes who had so pitilessly tormented, jeered at, and\r\nbeaten me.—_Page 36._]\r\n\r\nThe banks of the lake were covered along their entire extent by those\r\nvery apes who had so pitilessly tormented, jeered at, and beaten me. They\r\nhad all been kneeling just as I had knelt, had all risen at the same\r\ntime as I had done, and there they were with their muzzles dripping with\r\nwater. When I thought I had lost them, they had no doubt followed me\r\nin silence through the wood, by the aërial route of the tall branching\r\ntrees, and on seeing me kneel down to drink had imitated all my actions.\r\nAlthough my limbs ached with fatigue, and I was sore from head to foot\r\nfrom the innumerable blows which I had received, and although I began to\r\nexperience serious inquietude, on finding myself, since my shipwreck,\r\nin the midst of this constantly increasing crowd of apes, I could not\r\nrestrain a burst of laughter on seeing with what burlesque fidelity they\r\nreproduced my most trifling gestures, my most accidental attitudes,\r\nand even my involuntary movements. A new stupefaction took possession\r\nof me at finding my burst of laughter immediately echoed by thousands\r\nof similar cachinnations. Unable to control myself, I laugh my loudest,\r\nthey, in their turn, laugh louder still. This comedy threatened never\r\nto come to an end. Terrified at the unaccustomed noise, the birds,\r\nhidden in their nests of moss, dispersed among the ferns, swarming\r\nthrough the network of creepers, or asleep under the leaves, the great,\r\nthe small, the invisible birds—birds whose names are known only to the\r\nCreator, and of whose fantastic shapes and plumage the most comprehensive\r\nhuman language could scarcely give an idea—birds clad in brocade, like\r\nthe ancient doges; others with triple embroidered collars, like the\r\nprincesses of the middle ages; others, the plumage of whose tails flashed\r\nforth as many rays as the sun himself, rose, flapped their wings, and\r\ntook to flight, streaking the sky in frightened curves at the universal\r\nthunder of laughter which rent the air. The apes themselves, accustomed\r\nas they were to similar commotions on the part of the feathered tribe,\r\nwere, nevertheless, astonished at the strangeness and novelty of the\r\nsight. They stood up on their hind legs in order to enjoy it the more\r\nthoroughly. It was then that I remarked something which had before\r\nescaped my notice: many of my hairy persecutors wore a kind of narrow red\r\ncollar, the meaning of which I could not at first possibly understand.\r\nA brief reflection, however, made everything clear to me. Each of these\r\nred collars was a fragment of the cravat which I had resigned to my\r\ntormentors, and which, true to their imitative instincts, they had tied\r\nunder their chins; I never saw anything more comical than this piece of\r\nfinery with which several of the apes were strangling themselves, in\r\ntying it so tightly that it could not come undone, or be stolen from them\r\nby their jealous comrades. These apes in their scarlet cravats presented\r\na spectacle which, under circumstances more propitious to one’s personal\r\nsecurity than those in which I at present found myself, I should no\r\ndoubt have enjoyed immensely.\r\n\r\nI had managed to quench my thirst, but my hunger had not been appeased.\r\nFar from it in fact, since the satisfaction accorded to the one sense\r\nonly rendered the other more imperious. My hunger had increased\r\nconsiderably during the last quarter of an hour, for I had noticed on\r\nthe trees, by the brink of the lake, certain fruits of a bright golden\r\ncolour, fruits delicious to behold, and no doubt more delicious still to\r\nthe taste, but situated so high, that never man, even though he were a\r\nsailor of Java, could hope to reach and gather them. The trees were from\r\n180 to 200 feet high, with no other branches shooting out from their\r\ntall stems except those which clustered together at the summit, with\r\nperfectly smooth barks, and offering not the slightest point of support\r\nfor either hand or foot for three-fourths of their entire height. My eyes\r\ncoveted this fruit, my stomach yearned for it; but how was I to obtain\r\npossession of it? After all manner of sterile calculations as to how this\r\nwas to be accomplished, I decided to throw, with my utmost strength, a\r\nfew sharp flints into one of the trees, in the hope of detaching some of\r\nthe fruit from its stalk and bringing it to the ground. I knew that I\r\nwas sufficiently adroit to hit the fruit at which I aimed, but for all\r\nthat it did not break off as I anticipated. The flint, after striking\r\nit, bounded from branch to branch with a loud noise—the slightest thing,\r\nit must be remembered, produces a loud noise in these solitary isles,\r\nthe silence of which has not yet been broken by the restless activity of\r\nman—encountering in its fall quantities of large leaves lightly joined to\r\nthe branches of the tree by their juicy stalks. The apes, who had been\r\nintently watching all my movements, scarcely awaited the descent of the\r\nfirst stone, before they collected together all the flints they could,\r\nand flung them one after another at the topmast branches of the trees.\r\nThe noise thus made sounded for all the world like the crackling of hail\r\nand grapeshot. Delighted with their occupation, they formed as it were a\r\nchain, and passed the stones rapidly from hand to hand, so that those who\r\npreferred to throw might not be kept waiting. One hears of entire fields\r\nof maize being consumed in a few hours by voracious locusts coming from\r\nLybia; here, in a few minutes, fruit, leaves, and branches were detached\r\nfrom the group of trees into the midst of which my flint had taken its\r\nuseless flight. The banks of the lake were covered with them to such a\r\ndegree, that I had only to stretch out my hand to grasp any quantity of\r\nthe fruit which I was dying as it were to taste. The very instant that\r\nthe apes, to whom I was indebted for this abundant harvest, saw me carry\r\none of these fruits to my mouth, they imitated my example all along the\r\nline. A thousand arms were carried to a thousand mouths. The manœuvre was\r\nexecuted as though in obedience to a military command, and with all the\r\nprecision of Prussian discipline. I raised my elbow—the elbows of the\r\napes were simultaneously raised. I spat out a pip—the air was riddled\r\nwith pips. The echoes of the lake repeated naught but the ludicrous\r\nsnapping and clattering of jaws. In a few moments its surface was half\r\nhidden by masses of rind stripped from the fruits which I and the apes\r\nhad devoured with burlesque unanimity.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was now completely at the mercy of chance, and destined\r\nperhaps to escape one danger only to fall into another still greater, I\r\nnevertheless desired to free myself from the odious restraint in which I\r\nwas held by this accursed assemblage. It was not without fear, moreover,\r\nthat I saw the day draw in and the night approach. I had no desire to\r\nfind myself, during the hours of darkness, beset by this legion of\r\ndemons, whose capricious surprises are not restrained within the same\r\nlimits which bound the human imagination. I had every hope that the next\r\nday might bring me in contact with some of the native population, since\r\nthe island was evidently not a desert. If I could only penetrate some\r\ndistance inland, I should no doubt come across human habitations; but,\r\nmeanwhile, it was necessary to pass through this dreaded night. In my\r\nfeverish anxiety, increased by the intimate knowledge which I possessed\r\nof the cruel ways of these detestable animals, the idea occurred to me\r\nthat, since they were so obstinately bent on exactly copying all my\r\nmovements, the best thing to be done was for me to pretend to go to\r\nsleep. If I were clever enough to get them off to sleep by the mere\r\nforce of imitation, I might so far profit by their lethargy as to escape\r\nfrom their surveillance and penetrate to the interior of the island.\r\nI was ignorant, it is true, of its extent and shape; but in a whole\r\nnight’s journey I could certainly make sufficient way to put ten or\r\ntwelve leagues between them and me. The idea appeared a good one, and I\r\nimmediately proceeded to put it into execution.\r\n\r\nI commenced by collecting several armsful of dry leaves, which I made\r\na point of putting down with all the noise possible, so as to provoke\r\nthe imitative attention of my guards. And, precisely as I thought, the\r\nentire troop immediately rushed forward, and with the most comical\r\nprecipitation, proceeded to collect armsful of dry leaves, and spread\r\nthem, as they had seen me do, like straw upon the ground. Delighted with\r\nthis commencement, I afterwards heaped up a certain quantity of leaves\r\nat the foot of a tree where I had chosen a spot for my couch; they\r\nimmediately did the same. Preparations for slumber being completed on\r\nboth sides, I extended myself leisurely on my bed. This time my imitators\r\ndid not move, which was of course a bad sign. There was evidently an\r\nunpleasant hitch in the development of the plan by means of which I\r\nhad hoped that my tormentors would fall into my trap. With their feet\r\nburied in the leaves, with outstretched necks and muzzles turned towards\r\nme, and with eyes fixed steadily upon me, they followed eagerly the\r\nslightest movements of my body, but not one of them laid down as I had\r\ndone. I began to think that they distrusted me; nevertheless, I pursued\r\nmy project so as to know for certain what I had to expect. I therefore\r\nstretched out my arms as a man does who is about to fall asleep; I gaped\r\nonce or twice as wide as I possibly could, and at length closed my eyes.\r\nOf these three movements, they imitated only one; they gaped enough to\r\ndislocate their jaws, but that was all.\r\n\r\nI had taken particular care to keep my eyelids lowered, whereas they kept\r\ntheir eyes completely open. I had even carried the pretence of sleep so\r\nfar as to snore; nothing, however, came of it. Not a single ape, big or\r\nlittle, yellow, black, brown, or grey, fell into the snare.\r\n\r\nAt length something like a truce was arranged between us. It was at this\r\nmoment that the idea, which had occurred to me during the thrashing which\r\nI had received, came into my mind again. I fancied I could distinguish\r\namong this crowd of apes, so attentive in watching my slightest\r\nmovements, certain faces which were not entirely unknown to me. The first\r\ntime this strange idea occurred to me I passed it by as the offspring of\r\na troubled brain, but now I felt impressed by its reality.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour, and such quarters of hours are centuries, I\r\nacted this farce of sleep, and to my disgust discovered that I did not\r\nsucceed in making a single dupe. All at once, when my eyes were scarcely\r\nhalf open, I perceived two of the biggest apes of the troop coming\r\ntowards me. They did not approach me walking on all fours along the\r\nsand, but after the fashion in which they invariably move about in the\r\nwandering and vagabondising kind of life they lead in the woods, that is,\r\nby swinging from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and scarcely making\r\nmore noise than a bird. Having arrived above my head, and God knows if I\r\nhad them a single instant out of my sight, they slipped down without the\r\nslightest noise to the ground, and immediately moved with the same silent\r\nprecautions, one to my right hand and the other to my left.\r\n\r\nHaving taken up their positions they remained perfectly immovable for\r\nseveral minutes.\r\n\r\nI had to do with two hideous ourang-outangs whose prodigious strength and\r\nagility were shown by their short and compact bodies and sinewy limbs. I\r\njudged, from these characteristic signs, that they were capable of easily\r\novercoming ten unarmed men. After having carefully observed me, in fact\r\nstudied me, and one may say, surveyed me all over with a gravity at once\r\ndroll and magisterial, as though to assure themselves that I was really\r\nasleep, one of the two ourang-outangs placed himself at my feet.\r\n\r\nThe ourang-outang on my right now commenced smelling me under the nose\r\nafter the fashion in which deer sniff each other, then he examined my\r\nhair most attentively, evidently with intentions which my English habits\r\nof cleanliness rendered altogether unnecessary. The other ourang-outang\r\nhaving first of all pulled off my shoes, next amused himself with the\r\ningeniousness of a child who wishes at any cost to discover how it is\r\nthat his spring doll raises and lowers its arms, by bending my toes\r\nbackwards and forwards, appearing perfectly astonished and somewhat\r\nindignant, that a man was as well formed as an ape. These two terrible\r\nvalets-de-chambre bent upon bestowing their attentions on my person\r\ncaused me the most frightful distress; for the ourang-outang at my feet,\r\ninduced, no doubt, by his success with my shoes and stockings, next\r\nessayed to pull off my trousers. I would willingly have let him done\r\nso, but the ourang-outang at my head opposed him with all his strength,\r\nevidently desiring to relieve me of these garments in his own way; a way,\r\nI may observe, in which it is perfectly impossible for trousers to be\r\nremoved. There were first of all some sinister tuggings, then the strife\r\ngradually became sullen and obstinate; and at last it was something\r\nterrible. I was conscious of this from the successive giving way of\r\nbuttons, and from the stretching and cracking of the garments under the\r\nefforts of these two formidable antagonists, whose field of battle\r\nwould, in a few moments, most likely be my own body; which would become a\r\nprey to their remorseless instinct of destruction, and be torn to pieces\r\nby their long, sharp fangs and harpy-like claws.\r\n\r\nMy death seemed inevitable—I resolved to defend my life to the utmost\r\nof my power, and with this view gently slipped my hands into my pockets\r\nand drew forth my two pistols without arousing the slightest suspicion.\r\nAs matters were progressing very fast, I forthwith pointed one of them\r\ntowards the ourang-outang at my feet, and the other towards his companion\r\nat my head, hoping that if I were forced to fire I might succeed in\r\nkilling both my persecutors, whose deaths would, as a matter of course,\r\nbe immediately followed by my own. The fate which would await me after\r\nthis double murder was certainly not doubtful. The two or three hundred\r\napes who were present as spectators of this sight would certainly tear\r\nme into more pieces than they had torn my cravat. The fatal moment seems\r\nto be approaching! My nether garments give way—I place a finger on each\r\ntrigger. When all at once a shriek is heard, such a shriek as only a\r\nlocomotive with its breath of fire can send forth from its iron-bound\r\nbreast; and which was prolonged from echo to echo like claps of thunder\r\nrolling down a valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    I am attacked with delirium.—I set out on a journey of\r\n    discovery in the dead of night.—I encounter a boa, and a bat\r\n    with gigantic wings.—I reach the sea shore.—Simplicity of the\r\n    oyster; acuteness of the Ape.—I hoist a signal, and then fall\r\n    asleep from sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI open my eyes and perceive this crowd of apes all flying off, in the\r\nsame direction, with the rapidity of a cannon-ball. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of tails streak the horizon. These at length disappear, and\r\nfainter and fainter grows that chattering noise with which they have\r\nsought to excite one another to triple their speed, till at last it\r\nsounds merely like a tingling in the ear when one is troubled with a rush\r\nof blood to the head. The air is pure, the earth has already recovered\r\nits serenity, as after the disappearance of some fetid mist; I spring\r\nto my feet, I breathe freely, I feel as though I were born again! But\r\nwhence came this marvellous shriek? and what strange creature had given\r\nutterance to it? Was it a leopard wounded to death? Was it merely some\r\namorous tiger? Was it a human being? No, it could not have been. And how\r\ncame it, too, to be so generally comprehended? How was I to discover\r\nthis? Of whom could I inquire? Silence and solitude had in the twinkling\r\nof an eye taken the place of the frightful tumult and the savage and\r\ngrotesque scenes of a few moments before, but did this shriek signal the\r\nfall of the curtain, or merely the conclusion of an act of the drama?\r\nWas it, in plain words, an end or only a momentary suspension—this\r\nspontaneous dispersion of all the monsters, who had left me as it were by\r\na miracle? Night was approaching; in fact, it had already set in. What\r\nwas I to do? What was to become of me in the midst of this scattered\r\ncolony, among unknown hordes which my imagination pictured as only the\r\nmore frightful, the longer they delayed to show themselves!\r\n\r\nI might remain very well where I was till the next day, but had I\r\nnot reason to fear the return of my enemies, who would reappear more\r\ndetermined than ever to torment me with their inexhaustible tricks,\r\nand more particularly so now that they knew how much my superior they\r\nwere both in boldness and strength? On the other hand, where could I go\r\nwithout encountering the risk of being devoured by the thousands of wild\r\nanimals which doubtless lay crouching, swollen with rage, within the\r\nshadow of these almost impenetrable jungles?\r\n\r\nThe waverings of my mind brought on a burning fever, which caused my\r\nbrain to throb, like the booming of a large bell, or the roaring of the\r\nbillows breaking upon a rocky shore, and made me fancy at times that\r\nI could hear sounds similar to those which come from great centres of\r\npopulation; such, indeed, as I had heard in the neighbourhood of Goa\r\nand Macao. Shipwrecked people, it is well known, have these singular\r\nhallucinations. They are like clocks which have been set wrong, and keep\r\non going—the hands traversing the dial, but no longer marking the correct\r\ntime—and which strike at hazard.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of this delirium, a bright red streak all at once\r\ntinted the horizon, dividing it like a cut made with a knife in the rind\r\nof a pomegranate. Suddenly this crimson line appeared to be swollen at a\r\nparticular point, and a globe of fire rose majestically in the sky. It\r\nwas the moon, which was nearly at the full. I believed that it was rising\r\nfor me alone, so much calm did it seem to bring me, while enveloping me\r\nwith its beautiful light. I took courage. My blood flowed more tranquilly\r\nthrough my veins. I reasoned on my situation with sequence and lucidity,\r\nand proved to myself that there was no serious reason for my remaining\r\nany longer in the place where I then was. My resolution was soon taken,\r\nand I proceeded to arm myself with the stoutest bamboo I could find\r\non the border of the lake, to serve me for a defensive weapon in case\r\nof necessity. I then set about to determine whether this vast sheet\r\nof limpid water, which was spread before me, had, as was probably the\r\ncase, some outlet through which it emptied itself into the sea. To be\r\nenlightened on this geographical problem was of the utmost importance to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nLarge sheets of water, although there are notable exceptions in Oceania,\r\ngenerally fall into the sea; if the lake therefore, on the banks of\r\nwhich I then was, had an important outlet, I was certain, by following\r\nthe course of it step by step, to arrive at the sea. And as it is rarely\r\nthe case that there are not certain spots on the banks of these streams\r\nwhere the native population, guided by the instinct of want, have raised\r\ntheir huts, I was equally certain to meet with these villages on my\r\nway. To discover this outlet I determined, if necessary, to make the\r\ncircuit of the lake without deviating at all in my course, spite of\r\nthe jungles which threatened to prevent me. After walking for about an\r\nhour a confused noise suddenly brought me to a standstill. I listened,\r\nthen hastened in the direction whence the sound proceeded, and found it\r\ngradually growing more and more distinct, until at length I recognised\r\nthe murmur of a considerable cascade. What I was in search of was\r\nevidently here. The waters of the lake fell into a second and lower\r\nbasin which, growing narrower a little further on, became the stream on\r\nwhich I had counted. I followed the course of this natural canal, but\r\nnot without encountering strange difficulties by the way. It was not an\r\neasy thing, as one may well believe, to continue walking for any length\r\nof time along a bank composed of spongy vegetable remains, on which it\r\nwas altogether impossible to place one’s feet without sinking up to the\r\nknees, and which was at times entirely hidden by a layer of fibrous\r\nshoots, creepers, bamboos, and mimosas interwoven and crossed one over\r\nanother with so much tenacity that they formed a kind of archway, beneath\r\nwhich I was forced to pass by, crawling along on my hands and knees. It\r\nwas in one of these dark tunnels, while placing my hands on the ground\r\nso as to draw myself along, that I seized hold of something round and\r\nslippery and cold as ice, whilst, at the same moment, a wing struck me\r\nin the face, producing a double sensation of horror. The cold, round,\r\nslippery thing was a serpent; the blow on my face was caused by a hideous\r\nbat with slimy wings three or four feet in breadth. I still shudder when\r\nI think of this frightful meeting.\r\n\r\nFor several hours I advanced thus towards an unknown goal, feeling more\r\nand more persuaded, as I proceeded, that the portion of the island\r\nalready traversed by me, under the perilous conditions which I have just\r\nendeavoured to relate, was not inhabited, unless, indeed, it happened to\r\ncontain other lakes and water-courses, a probability which was extremely\r\ndoubtful, considering the small extent of the islands composing the\r\ngroup, in the centre of which I had been shipwrecked. I concluded,\r\ntherefore, that no inhabitant of the island was likely to be met with at\r\nany considerable distance from this stream, along which, so far as I had\r\ntraced its course, there were no signs of human habitations to be seen. I\r\nconcluded, moreover, from a parity of reasoning, that the island did not\r\ncontain many wild beasts, since, as is well known from the testimony of\r\ntravellers and naturalists, they frequent by preference the muddy banks\r\nof rivers, where they are certain to find, during the heat of the day,\r\ncoolness, shade, and, above all, numerous prey for which they lie in\r\nwait, and, during the night, almost inaccessible retreats to which they\r\ncan retire.\r\n\r\nWhen I perceived above me the open sky, and some leagues of clear ground,\r\nboth to my right hand and my left, the day was beginning to break. The\r\nviolent exertion I had undergone, joined to the sudden freshness of the\r\nair, and the lightness of my yesterday’s repast, since fruit, however\r\ngood and luscious it may be, is scarcely sufficiently satisfying to\r\nstomachs accustomed to the endless variety of food—the result of a high\r\nstate of civilisation—had made me as ravenous as a tiger. I have never\r\nregretted so much as I then did, that Providence had not reserved to us,\r\nfor seasons of difficulty, the means of living on grass and plants like\r\nanimals of the herbivorous species, or endowed us like others with the\r\nfaculty of seizing our prey. In the primitive ages of the world we were\r\nendowed perhaps with a less exclusive organisation; but, however this\r\nmay have been, I was dying with hunger in the midst of a paradise of\r\nplants, ferns, and roots, which a horse or an ox would have considered\r\nthe rarest of delicacies. Whilst I was absorbed in these reflections,\r\nit was gradually becoming lighter; objects began to stand out from\r\nthe background of delicate violet, tinted with yellow, which is the\r\nforerunner of dawn in Oceania and southern China. A cool wind swept\r\nacross the earth, the sharpness and tempering quality of which convinced\r\nme that it had already passed over the sea, which I would have wagered my\r\nexistence was not far distant. Other signs confirmed me in my belief; the\r\ntrees were neither so thick together nor so large; the heath, which was\r\nmore stunted in its growth, was gradually becoming more scanty. When the\r\nsun showed itself above the horizon, I had only to exclaim, “There is the\r\nsea!” and I very soon did so.\r\n\r\nThe sea was scarcely two hundred yards from me when I first caught sight\r\nof its tiny waves—the same waves that were yesterday so furious—whitening\r\na complete bend of the shore. Supposing some degree of regularity\r\nin the form of the island, this bend would give it, according to my\r\ncalculations, a circumference of thirty leagues. Moreover, admitting,\r\nwhat I was satisfied of from observation, that the journey I had made\r\nduring the night was half the diameter of the entire island, that\r\nis, five leagues, which is the average size of the islands of this\r\ngroup. After having assured myself that the one half of the island was\r\nuninhabited along the banks of the stream which I had already traversed,\r\nI still entertained a hope that I might meet with a village on the\r\nsea-shore the inhabitants of which might possibly be fishermen, a common\r\nenough profession among the Malays; or they might perhaps do a little\r\ntrade by means of barter, which is a much less common profession; or they\r\nmight be pirates, a profession which is usually joined to all others in\r\nthese savage regions.\r\n\r\nI commenced my excursion along the sea-shore, in spite of the fatigue\r\nwhich I was suffering. I knew that I had no time to lose, since, if the\r\nsun once rose in the heavens, its intense heat would render all bodily\r\nexertion impossible in this torrid zone, for at least ten hours to come.\r\n\r\nIf for the first three miles I discovered no more traces of the island\r\nbeing inhabited than I had met with during the previous evening, I could\r\nscarcely doubt that my good friends the apes often visited this locality.\r\nI recognised them by these signs. Thousands of oysters were spread upon\r\nthe beach; and at least two layers of these oysters had been opened—not\r\nnaturally, but with the aid of a little stone placed between the two\r\nshells. Who had done this? Why, my apes, of course. It is well known\r\nthat oysters are a precious luxury to the entire monkey tribe, who are\r\nobliged to be very cunning in procuring themselves this treat, which is\r\nnot without its attendant dangers. How do you suppose they manage this?\r\nWhy, by throwing a stone between the two shells, at the precise moment\r\nthat the oyster chances to gape; in this manner they are sure of their\r\nprey, without having to make an exhibition of themselves with their hands\r\nor their muzzles caught in the powerful grip of the oyster, who has the\r\npreservative faculty of closing his shell directly he is seized hold of.\r\n\r\nAs oysters furnish a far more substantial dish than any quantity of\r\ntropical fruit, and as my plundering and wasteful apes had opened more\r\nof these delicacies than they had consumed, I commenced my repast with\r\na joyful heart. These bivalves were hardly equal to real Whitstable\r\nnatives, or even to the oysters of Ostend; nevertheless, five or six\r\ndozen were rapidly devoured. A tankard of bitter ale would have been an\r\nacceptable accompaniment; but as this was not to be had, I was forced\r\nto content myself with bumpers of pure water, quaffed from the palm\r\nof my hand. My appetite was no sooner appeased than, contrary to what\r\nis usual under similar circumstances, my troubles of mind returned.\r\nWas I, I again asked myself, about to be brought face to face with the\r\ninhabitants of this island, either at the curve of some bay, or behind\r\nsome projecting mass of rock? Filled with this hope—or rather, with this\r\nfear—I recommenced my explorations. But, after having ascended many\r\ncreeks, many little gulfs, on the banks of which the banyans displayed\r\ntheir rich green foliage, I not only met with not a single inhabitant,\r\nneither black, brown, yellow, nor copper-coloured—but, during the long\r\njourney which I had performed, from five o’clock in the morning until\r\nnoon, at which hour the burning heat poured down by the sun on my poor\r\nhead forced me to halt, I had seen neither junk, nor canoe, nor any kind\r\nof implement, no fragments of articles in common use among beings of the\r\nslightest intelligence; in a word, no single trace of man.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to remain for any length of time, at this hour of\r\nthe day, on this exposed coast, burnt up, as I was, by the sun, I deemed\r\nit prudent to proceed a short distance inland. On leaving the shore,\r\nI gathered, some hundred yards off, a stick of bamboo, the straightest\r\nand tallest I could find; and, after having stripped it of its leaves, I\r\nfastened to the end of it one of the two white handkerchiefs which I had\r\nabout me at the moment of abandoning the junk, and planted it firmly in\r\nthe sand. If some vessel should perceive this signal—of which there was,\r\nI feared, but little chance, the island being surrounded on all sides by\r\nreefs—it would be advised of the presence of an unfortunate castaway, and\r\nwould, perhaps, make an effort to take him off.\r\n\r\nThe rude blows of the day before, the extraordinary fatigues of the\r\nnight, the mental troubles of all kinds which I had undergone during the\r\npast three days, rendered that sleep which I hastened to enjoy under the\r\ntamarind trees that grew between the sea and the more wooded part of the\r\nisland, most welcome to me. My eyes closed with an unspeakable pleasure.\r\nMy drowsiness resembled the calm of an aërial voyage. The sea-breeze\r\npassed in long gusts through my hair, after having swept over my body,\r\nand refreshed and revivified all my limbs. The mixture of the strong\r\nvegetable odours by which I was surrounded with the salt air of the sea,\r\ncharged, as it was, with all the mysterious exhalations of the Indian\r\nOcean, formed a perfume, at once so agreeable and so intoxicating, that I\r\nwas conscious of its influence even in my sleep.\r\n\r\nI must have slept for a long time, since the sun, which was at his zenith\r\nwhen I laid down, was precisely at the same point of the heavens when\r\nI awoke, so that I had slept for four-and-twenty hours. My awakening\r\nwill never be effaced from my remembrance as long as I live, owing to\r\na circumstance which I recollect with sorrow and regret, and with some\r\ndegree of remorse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    I have a very agitated dream.—During my waking moments I\r\n    unconsciously commit a murder.—At night time I encounter\r\n    a strange apparition in the middle of the forest.—A great\r\n    light illumines the air.—I advance towards it, buoyed up with\r\n    hope.—It suddenly disappears.—The dawn discloses to me a most\r\n    singular sight.—I witness the proceedings of a court-martial\r\n    the members composing which have each four hands.—Disgraceful\r\n    corruption of justice.—Ridiculous parody on the manners and\r\n    institutions of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a dream during my sleep. In this dream I found myself in the midst\r\nof those same horrid apes from whom I had so miraculously escaped the\r\nday before. I was still in their power! Nothing seemed changed, neither\r\nthe scene nor the actors. The lake lay spread before me; the trees rose\r\nup and waved upon its banks; the leaves and fruit, which had been broken\r\noff by the stones, covered the ground. My two redoubtable ourang-outangs\r\nhad not left me; one was still at my feet, the other at my head. They\r\ncontinued those persecutions of which my unfortunate garments were the\r\ntheatre. After having torn them in pieces through tugging at them and\r\nattempting to pull them off the wrong way, they had uncovered my breast;\r\nand, after a minute examination of my skin, directed their attention\r\nto my ribs, which they evidently wished to force apart so as to see\r\nwhat they inclosed. With the view of solving this problem each of them\r\npossessed himself of a large stone, and made preparations to break me\r\nopen, a proceeding to which they usually have recourse when they desire\r\nto devour the inside of a tortoise or cocoa-nut. Two large stones were\r\nalready suspended over my breast; self-preservation before everything,\r\nthought I, and fired at one of the two ourang-outangs and killed him; I\r\nam about to fire at the other, when the noise of the first shot woke me\r\nup. On awakening, I find myself in a perfect rage, almost mad with anger,\r\nand with a pistol grasped in my hand. A group of apes are by my side; I\r\npoint my pistol, touch the trigger, one of them is hit, and falls. May\r\nthe Almighty, in His goodness, ever preserve me and mine from another\r\nnight like this! The poor ape, who was no terrible ourang-outang like\r\nthat of my dream, but a peaceful vervet, dragged himself bleeding to my\r\nfeet. He was mortally wounded a little below the heart. Not wishing to\r\nprolong his sufferings, I seized him by the tail, and, swinging him round\r\nlike a stone in a sling, dashed his head against a tree. The unfortunate\r\nvervet was still alive. With what a touching glance he appealed to me as\r\nhe licked my hands, as though begging me not to put him to death, and\r\nprayed to me with low, plaintive cries which I can still hear! In order\r\nto put him the quicker out of his misery, I ran with him to the beach and\r\nplunged him into the sea till he was suffocated. During this time, which\r\nappeared to me as long as if I were undergoing the same tortures myself,\r\nhis poor little eyes continued to follow mine; his dying looks were\r\nat once a reproach and a prayer. Were I to live a hundred years, this\r\npicture, in which suffering had elevated the instinct of the brute to the\r\nlevel of the cruel intelligence of man, would never be effaced from my\r\nmemory. And these lines, which I have written with an aching heart, are\r\nsome kind of punishment for my needless crime, for this poor ape had done\r\nno harm whatever to me.\r\n\r\nLater I remembered what Buffon says of the vervet, “that it is one of\r\nthe most lively and amusing of apes; is scarcely as large as a cat; and\r\nhas a brown body, with flesh-coloured face and ears. The vervets are\r\nfantastic in their tastes and affections, appearing to have a strong\r\ninclination for some persons and a great aversion to others.”\r\n\r\nI was far more distressed at my cruel action, although I hardly need\r\nhave been, since I had killed the vervet while I was still stupefied by\r\nsleep and under the influence of a dream. When I returned to the place\r\nwhence I had fired the pistol, I was grieved to discover that the shot\r\nwhich had killed one vervet had, unfortunately, wounded another of the\r\ngroup into the midst of which I had so recklessly fired. All the other\r\napes belonging to the same species had assembled round their wounded\r\ncompanion, and were placing their fingers in his wound, as though they\r\nwished to probe it. While some kept it open, others brought leaves which\r\nthey chewed and gently placed in the wound itself. This last act upset\r\nall my preconceived ideas with regard to the intelligence of these\r\nanimals, so badly treated, by some naturalists, who have confounded\r\ninferior kinds with species like those of the vervets, that almost\r\napproach our own, falling into the same error as that ignorant observer\r\nwho placed in the same rank, under the pretext that they were both men,\r\nthe _cretin_ of the Alps and the admirably-organised inhabitant of Italy\r\nor Greece. Since this example of apes rendering one another mutual help\r\nin time of danger, and nursing one another with the aid of special\r\nremedies known only to themselves, has frequently come before my eyes, I\r\nhave not hesitated to relate one instance of which I was an eye-witness,\r\nin the hope of making the reader share the surprise and interest which it\r\nawakened in me.\r\n\r\nMy poor apes at length retired, carrying with them their wounded\r\ncompanion, and leaving me one sorrow more to add to those which already\r\noppressed me. I spent a miserable day, haunted by remorse for my crime.\r\nI could not banish from my mind the piteous expression of these poor\r\nanimals, and the mingled look of goodness, gentleness, suffering, and\r\nresignation imprinted in their features, so utterly distinct from those\r\nof other apes, from whom they appeared completely separated, not by the\r\nmere effect of chance, or by the boundary which the difference of genius\r\nhad raised between them.\r\n\r\nWhen night came on I had already left the actors and the theatre of these\r\nevents far behind me. About midnight, on hearing, in a wood of mimosas,\r\nand seemingly quite close to me, an indefinable rustling, such as the\r\ndry husks of the bread-tree produce when driven about by the wind, I\r\nremembered all at once that I had forgotten to reload my pistols. Before\r\nproceeding another step I charged them with ball, and advanced cautiously\r\ntowards the spot whence the noise appeared to proceed. I approached\r\nslowly on tiptoe, holding my breath, and with my heart beating violently,\r\nas I gently pushed aside the thorny branches of the mimosas, and raised\r\nthem again with the same prudent caution. I stretched forth my neck, and\r\nby the light of the moon, which shone as brightly as on the preceding\r\nevening, I perceived a skeleton suspended from the branch of a tree—a\r\nskeleton, too, of huge size: its bones, which were white as ivory,\r\nstood out from the dark green leaves with a power of relief which added\r\nconsiderably to the terror of its aspect. As I watched it swinging to and\r\nfro in the wind, the sensation which I experienced was by no means an\r\nagreeable one, and a nervous shudder passed through my limbs. Eventually\r\nI reasoned with myself, and decided not to draw too sinister a conclusion\r\nfrom a circumstance which perhaps, after all, did not partake of that\r\ndegree of atrocity that my imagination had hastily pictured.\r\n\r\nI now walked boldly up to the skeleton, and sought to catch hold of its\r\nfoot, but the foot proved to be a hand. The skeleton was evidently that\r\nof an ape—an ape, too, of the largest kind; in other words, a gigantic\r\nmandrill. Yes, a mandrill—that enemy of the baboon with whom it shares\r\nthe empire of ferocity and terror. I considered, from the size of the\r\nskeleton, that the ape to which it belonged must have surpassed, in size\r\nand strength, all known examples of this formidable species. But how came\r\nhe to be suspended here, I asked myself? And why was it that his skin had\r\nbeen entirely removed? Not the least fragment of it was to be seen at the\r\nfoot of the tree. Had he been flayed after being hung, and had his death\r\nthen been stamped with all the forms of a degrading punishment?\r\n\r\nAs my reflections, under the shadow of this improvised gibbet, failed to\r\nproduce any kind of solution of the above enigma, I hastened to leave\r\nthe spot, pondering over in my mind as to the proportion of apes and men\r\noccupying this spot of earth in the midst of the sea. One will easily\r\ncomprehend that my mind was constantly indulging in speculations—first of\r\nall as to the probability of the island being inhabited, and then as to\r\nthe particular kind of people who dwelt therein.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was asking myself these questions for the thousandth time, as\r\nI walked straight on without knowing whither I was going, it seemed to\r\nme that the light of the moon underwent, for some minutes, a notable\r\ndiminution. What, thought I, could possibly be the cause of this? I\r\nraised my head. The moon’s disk was really clouded by a reddish mist,\r\nslightly tinted with grey. This mist was evidently not a cloud. Moreover,\r\nin so pure an atmosphere, a cloud, the sign of wind and tempest, would\r\nhave passed over much higher in the sky. At one time it seemed so low\r\nthat it occurred to me it was some exhalation from the lake, a vapour\r\nproduced by the vast collections of vegetable remains accumulated on\r\nits margin. To put an end to my doubts on this score, I climbed up\r\na tree, and there I discovered—victory and release from my enforced\r\ncaptivity—that it was the smoke from a fire burning in the interior of\r\nthe island. A fire! The island was undoubtedly inhabited, then—inhabited,\r\ntoo, by human beings, since man alone can procure himself fire, man alone\r\nknows how to use it, and man alone has need of it. I was then among\r\nbeings of my own kind. I was saved—or perhaps lost! Nevertheless it was\r\na fact that I was among members of the human family. Acting on this\r\nconviction, I thought it only prudent to slip a second bullet into each\r\nof my pistols.\r\n\r\nCollecting together all my scattered faculties, I imposed upon them\r\nthe task of guiding me in the direction in which I supposed this fire\r\nto be, and the object of which was now a source of some anxiety to me.\r\nDid it indicate one of those extraordinary conflagrations, in producing\r\nwhich the savages of Oceania have frequently no other motive beyond\r\ndestroying, in a few hours, vast tracts of forests, that they may gratify\r\nthemselves with a most sublime sight? Did it betray the presence of a\r\nband of pirates, arrived perhaps in the island during this very evening,\r\nand sharing their booty by the light of some immense fire which they had\r\nkindled in accordance with their prevailing habits of destruction? Did\r\nit indicate the chief settlement of the native population, who, during\r\nthe hours of universal silence, were giving themselves up to certain wild\r\nrejoicings, or were engaged in consummating some nocturnal sacrifice\r\nunder the mysterious light of the moon?\r\n\r\nThe hope that I was at length about to find myself among members of the\r\nhuman family was dimmed by the reflection that these men would certainly\r\nnot be finished models of civilisation, for I was not ignorant of the\r\nfact that many islands of Oceania have been, since the creation of the\r\nworld, and are likely to continue for a long time to come, nothing more\r\nthan nests of cannibals. Cannibals, however, do not always eat people\r\nany more than serpents always sting them, so there was, at any rate, one\r\nchance in my favour out of something like a score of chances against me.\r\nMoreover, hope does not reason for itself like fear is apt to do.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to admire the magnificence of the night, magnificent\r\neven to me, accustomed as I was to the incomparable nights of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere; without lending an ear to the different harmonies\r\ncomposed of notes of a character utterly unknown to me, since it must not\r\nbe forgotten that every island of Oceania is a world apart, a complete\r\nuniverse in itself, often having its flowers, its plants, its birds, its\r\nreptiles, and its human occupants, different from the men, reptiles,\r\nbirds, plants, and flowers of the island adjoining; without pausing to\r\nexamine anything, no matter however strange or ravishing, I continued\r\nto advance in a straight line towards that part of the island where I\r\nthought the fire which I had seen from afar must be burning.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three long hours I discovered it was by no means so easy to\r\narrive at this earnestly desired goal as I had pictured it. The surface\r\nof the island being more or less undulating, whenever I descended into\r\na hollow, or had to cross some ravine which intercepted my path, I\r\nimmediately lost sight of the radiant glow which served as a beacon. On\r\nseveral occasions I had to climb to the top of a tall tree before I could\r\nmake certain that I was pursuing the right direction. Unfortunately the\r\nfire was not always maintained at the same degree of intensity, and there\r\nwas one critical moment when, after climbing to the topmost branches of\r\nthe tallest tree I could find, I could distinguish nothing but the merest\r\nspark. My most ardent prayers were that it might not become totally\r\nextinguished before the break of day, but my supplications were of no\r\navail. The fire flickered for a moment or two, and then went out. I could\r\nnow only guide myself by certain signs; I was already in the midst of a\r\nsea of creepers, with which the ground was carpeted, and I had to pass\r\nthrough fibres of bamboo more or less impenetrable for a depth of at\r\nleast forty feet, and then, what long circuits I should have to take!\r\n\r\nA discovery which I made at this moment went far to counterbalance the\r\ndiscouragement I had just experienced on finding the light which I had\r\npursued with so much tenacity extinguished. This discovery affected me\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nSoon after quitting the marshy plain of bamboos, from which I only\r\nemerged after leaving some portions of my dress and skin as traces of my\r\npath, I found myself once more on solid ground. While passing between the\r\nnumerous shrubs which covered it, and gave it the appearance of a vast\r\nnatural orchard, I came across some tempting-looking fruit. By chance,\r\nI tasted it, and discovered from its flavour that it was evidently the\r\nproduce of a regular system of culture. There was none of that primitive\r\nharshness which all fruits as a general rule possess till man has\r\nimproved their flavour. This discovery was a further convincing proof to\r\nme that the island was inhabited. It reassured me and encouraged me in\r\nmy hopes, since it was not only certain that the island was inhabited,\r\nbut that it was inhabited by men skilled in agricultural pursuits, and\r\nconsequently occupying no mean place in the scale of civilisation.\r\n\r\nAt length the dawn appeared; the sky was scarcely lighted up by the first\r\nrays of the rising sun ere the uproar which I had heard during the three\r\npreceding days again rent the air. These frightful noises, indistinct at\r\nfirst, afterwards comprised all the various gradations that belong to the\r\nvoices of wild animals, from the hypocritical and nervous mewing of the\r\ntiger and the guttural howling of the hyena to the most piercing shrieks\r\nand the shrillest whistlings. I started with affright at the explosion of\r\nthese horrible sounds, which seemed to spring from the depths of a vast\r\nglade, which all at once opened out before me. It was like a battery,\r\nsuddenly unmasked, discharging all its guns at once. Without knowing what\r\nit was that I sought to avoid, I darted on one side and hid myself behind\r\nthe trunk of a tree, bowed down to the ground and covered with a thick\r\nmantle of moss and leaves.\r\n\r\nThe day, which in these inflammable zones does not steal on by degrees,\r\nbut bursts forth all at once into noon, filled the glade with its\r\ndazzling light; and through the numerous openings in the trees I beheld\r\na sight which would seem to the reader altogether improbable, did I not\r\npropose, further on, to bring forward the testimony of one of the most\r\ncelebrated German naturalists in support of my statement.\r\n\r\nIn a vast arena, a group of individuals, clad in red coats and with\r\ncocked hats—surmounted by plumes of feathers, such as English officers\r\nwear—on their heads, were seated on some rising ground, evidently in\r\ngrave deliberation, as though holding a kind of court-martial. In the\r\nmidst of this conclave I caught sight of a commanding-looking figure,\r\nalso clothed in scarlet, whose head and face were almost hidden beneath\r\nthe ample shade of a gigantic cocked hat.\r\n\r\nThe reader is certainly about to share my surprise. These individuals\r\nwere apes. Yes, apes. Again, and always, apes. But why were they dressed\r\nout in garments in which one is unaccustomed to see them in their natural\r\nstate? Where had they procured these martial-looking coats and these\r\nformidable cocked hats? These were riddles impossible to solve; it must\r\nbe left to the course of events to bring about an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe apes composing this group were siamangs, a redoubtable species,\r\nwho are, as Buffon says, among the largest of quadrumanous animals,\r\napproaching the baboon in size.\r\n\r\nThese siamangs were presided over by the big ape who wore the admiral’s\r\nhat. And he was a baboon. One could not be mistaken on this point, and I\r\nabove all, for was not Karabouffi the Second—Karabouffi the incendiary—a\r\nbaboon? How came it that at this moment I seemed to see in the person of\r\nthe president of the court-martial the very image of this treacherous\r\nmonster?\r\n\r\n“The ourang-outang,” says Buffon in his admirable work, “the ape who most\r\nresembles man, is the most intelligent, the gravest, and most docile\r\nof all apes. The magot, which, with its muzzle and dog-like fangs,\r\ndiverges from the human form and approaches that of animals, is rough,\r\ndisobedient, and slovenly; while baboons, which only resemble man by\r\ntheir hands, and have tails, sharp claws, and large nostrils, have the\r\nair of ferocious beasts, and what is more, do not belie their looks.”\r\n\r\nAround this hideous tribunal, and ranged in triple and quadruple circles,\r\nI noticed a crowd of apes of different kinds, but all of the very worst\r\nspecies, and all, moreover, clad, if one can call it clad, or adorned,\r\nif one can call it adorned, with some portion of the costume of an\r\nEnglish officer, either of the army or navy. One had, for instance, a\r\nhat splendidly got up, with a most superb plume of feathers, but he had\r\nno red coat to set it off with; another had a red coat, but no trousers;\r\na third, on the contrary, had white trousers, but neither red coat nor\r\nbelt; a fourth had a belt and nothing else; a fifth was distinguished\r\nonly by a pair of white gloves, in which he placed sometimes his hands,\r\nand sometimes his feet, or rather what represent feet in an ape; a sixth\r\nhad passed his arms through the sleeves of a midshipman’s blue jacket,\r\nbut with so little good luck, that the garment was hind-part before;\r\nanother wore an enormous gorget, which made him carry his head in the air\r\nlike a tambour major; whilst his neighbour, more favoured by fortune,\r\nor perhaps holding a higher rank, for I was of course ignorant of the\r\nprecise significance of the various military trappings worn by these\r\ncreatures with a gravity which at that moment astonished me a hundred\r\ntimes more than the ordinary extravagances of their fellows; whilst his\r\nneighbour, as I was saying, wore golden epaulettes on a cavalry colonel’s\r\ncoat. And this costume would not have become him so very badly, had it\r\nnot been much too large for him, and capable, indeed, of containing at\r\nleast half-a-dozen colonels of his particular bulk. A sort of finish\r\nwas given to his uniform by a pair of white gloves and a military sash\r\nwith silk and gold fringe. If no one of these apes displayed on his own\r\nperson a complete example of military costume, many at least among them\r\nexhibited special portions of it, and I should state that all were armed\r\nwith a large sabre or a sword.\r\n\r\nI should certainly fall far short of the truth if I attempted to describe\r\nmy impressions at the sight of this insulting burlesque of one of the\r\nmost honourable of professions—at the sight of these masquerade officers,\r\nevery one of whom trailed after him a tail which looked all the more\r\nludicrous, peeping out as it did from under his long coat—at the sight\r\nof those generals who amused themselves with minute investigations of\r\nthe heads of their colleagues, not, however, for phrenological purposes,\r\nwhilst their colleagues considerately rendered them the same service.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a frightful guttural cry burst forth from the breast\r\nof the big baboon who occupied the president’s place, and all those\r\nincongruities on which I had been speculating were in an instant\r\nforgotten. There was silence for some minutes, and I endeavoured to\r\nprofit by it by putting my ideas—fearfully strained by all that I had\r\nseen—a little in order. But the effort was a useless one. I asked myself\r\nto no purpose for an explanation of the strange society assembled\r\nbefore me; I knew well enough that I was not dreaming, like I was the\r\nday before, when I fancied myself about to be assassinated by the two\r\nourang-outangs.\r\n\r\nIt was not the order which I found reigning among these numerous apes\r\nassembled, as I fancied them to be, in court-martial, that caused me the\r\nmost astonishment, since I remembered what that illustrious naturalist,\r\nMarcgrave, says—it was the sight of these hats on their brainless heads,\r\nthese coats on their ridiculous backs, that awakened in me the greatest\r\nsurprise; for how was it possible to account for the noble military\r\nuniform being prostituted to such base uses as these?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: While he was speaking, these unfortunate wretches trembled\r\nall over, from head to foot.—_Page 63._]\r\n\r\n“Every day,” observes Marcgrave in his natural history, “morning and\r\nevening, the siamangs assemble in the woods. One among them takes up his\r\nposition on some rising ground, and makes a sign to the others to seat\r\nthemselves around him. When he sees that they are all properly placed,\r\nhe commences speaking so loud and fast that at a distance a person would\r\nimagine they were all crying out together. Yet only one among them is\r\nspeaking; the others preserve the most perfect silence. When the speaker\r\nhas finished, he makes a sign with his hand for the others to reply to\r\nhim, whereupon, at the same instant, they all commence shouting out\r\ntogether, creating, as may be supposed, the most perfect din until, by\r\nanother sign with his hand, the ape who opened the discussion commands\r\nthem to silence. In a moment they obey him, and are silent as death. The\r\nfirst one then resumes his speech, and it is only after having listened\r\nto him most attentively to the end of his oration that they take steps to\r\nbreak up the assembly.”\r\n\r\nThe president of the conclave, the big baboon, decked out in the\r\nadmiral’s or general’s hat, by a single movement of his hand, ordered the\r\nadvance of twenty apes, who, I observed, were securely bound with ropes\r\nmade of some fibrous bark. When they were ranged before him like so many\r\ncriminals, he addressed them in a succession of cries similar to those\r\nwhich I had just heard, but modulated in some degree, as though intended\r\nto give expression to certain positive ideas. While he was speaking,\r\nthese unfortunate wretches trembled all over, from head to foot, and\r\nno sooner had he concluded, than, apparently driven to desperation,\r\nthey endeavoured to escape. Vain attempt! Other apes, armed with knotty\r\nbamboos, which they did not hesitate to use, guarded every outlet.\r\n\r\nI was not long in discovering that these apes, on whom the assembly\r\nwere evidently sitting in judgment, belonged to the same species as my\r\nunfortunate victim of the previous day. They were vervets, and were\r\ndistinguished from their judges by their more delicately-shaped limbs,\r\ntheir more intelligent-looking heads, and, above all, by a certain air\r\nof goodness and amiability, which was no doubt a crime in the eyes of\r\nthose by whom they had just been condemned.\r\n\r\nAnd what frightful-looking fellows were their judges, who formed what\r\nmay be styled the supreme court of the big baboon! How they sought to\r\nread beforehand in their master’s eyes the opinion which they would\r\nbe permitted to hold! Although some among them were already bald, and\r\nothers displayed the white hair of old age, that natural sign of prudence\r\nand badge of respect, they did not the less rival their fellows in\r\nobsequiousness towards their master. If he chanced to utter a cry, they\r\nwere the apes that, in the fullness of their sympathy, cried the loudest.\r\nIf he scratched his thigh, in a moment of deep thought, they hastened to\r\nalmost flay their legs by tearing at them with their claws.\r\n\r\nTouched with so many marks of abject humility, the august baboon would\r\nevery now and then take from one of the side pouches of his mouth a mass\r\nof masticated nuts or fruit, and throw it into the faces of those servile\r\nofficials who surrounded him, and who, regarding the act as a mark of\r\ngracious condescension on his part, received it with the most lively\r\ncontortions of pleasure.\r\n\r\nSome old ourang-outangs, who had formerly lived with the incriminated\r\nvervets, being, I am convinced, on the point of pronouncing a decision\r\nin the prisoners’ favour, what do you think the big baboon did, as soon\r\nas he perceived the first indication of this misplaced pity of theirs?\r\nHe rolled his vulture-like eyes under his puckered eyelids, and showed\r\nhis horrible gums behind a smile formed by two wrinkled lips, and in an\r\ninstant the misplaced clemency of the old ourang-outangs utterly vanished.\r\n\r\nThe baboon now threw his staff of justice into the middle of the arena.\r\nThis it seems was intended as a signal, for immediately afterwards the\r\napes, to whom were delegated the functions of carrying out the sentences\r\npronounced by the supreme court, commenced showering down blows with\r\nsticks of bamboo on the poor condemned prisoners, whom they thrashed\r\nwith an unheard-of severity, driving them clean out of the inclosure and\r\nchasing them at last into the very depths of the forest.\r\n\r\nThis savage act of justice appeared to me as though it were chiefly\r\nintended to increase the authority which the big baboon evidently\r\nexercised over the apish community, since no sooner was the sitting\r\nconcluded than the siamangs, magots, and talapoins rushed forward to\r\ncongratulate him, to stroke and lick him, to jump upon his back and\r\nsalute him with respect, mingled with fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    The court-martial breaks up.—I secretly follow the members of\r\n    it.—I distinguish some houses between the trees, and believe\r\n    myself to be at last among my fellow-men.—My hopes are crushed\r\n    by discovering the devastated condition of the settlement.—I\r\n    meet with Saïmira and Mococo, the latter in captivity.—I\r\n    recognise in the president of the court-martial one of my two\r\n    baboons of Macao.—This discovery troubles me, the more so\r\n    when I find that Karabouffi’s power is supreme.—Foreseeing\r\n    the peril I should be in if recognised by him, I hide myself\r\n    in a grotto.—I am visited by Saïmira.—Weariness becomes at\r\n    length more intolerable than danger.—The light already seen\r\n    reappears.—I leave my retreat in search of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the big baboon was thoroughly tired of these attentions he waved\r\nhis hand by way of signal for his followers to desist, then rose\r\nmajestically, and, accompanied by his entire suite, proceeded to take his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from following the party, although by so doing I\r\nfelt that I exposed myself to a certain danger. I advanced, however,\r\ncautiously, step by step, and from tree to tree, halting when necessary,\r\nso that I might not be discovered. This gave me time to examine the spot\r\nwhere justice had just been meted out, and I was surprised to perceive\r\nat no great distance from it, through a wide opening between the trees,\r\na nest of little painted houses, constructed in the Indian style, and\r\nsuch as I had frequently seen in Java, Borneo, and generally in all the\r\nmore civilised parts of Oceania. Houses! I was then about to find myself,\r\nnot among a people more or less anthropophagical, but among a people\r\nfar advanced in civilisation; without doubt some European colony, and\r\nwhat is more, an English one, since the coats worn by that legion of apes\r\nwere of English cut, colour, and nationality. I now walked with restored\r\nconfidence behind my apes, clad in their blue and red toggery. Now and\r\nfor henceforth I need have no more fear of them. I felt almost inclined\r\nto twitch their garments and seize hold of their despised tails by way of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nAfter this discovery I fully expected to see ere long this troop of apes\r\nre-enter their cages under the guiding influence of their master’s whip.\r\nWith this view I hid myself lower down the road in a sort of thicket.\r\n“From my hiding-place,” I said to myself, “I shall be able to see this\r\ndiabolical procession defile before me with the big baboon at the head\r\nof it.” After a time they pass by, and what do I see? Whom do you think\r\nI recognise under the hat adorned with such a splendid plume of feathers\r\nand in the red coat, the brilliancy of which almost scorched my eyes?\r\nWhy, my terrible baboon of Macao; he whom I had so many times thrashed,\r\nwhom I had sold a year previously to Vice-Admiral Campbell the day before\r\nhis departure—in one word, Karabouffi! Karabouffi the First! Could it be\r\npossible? In this case the admiral must have disembarked his men on this\r\nisland. Were he and his crew still here? A new surprise put an end to my\r\nspeculations. I find myself at this moment gently touched on the arm, and\r\non turning round see beside me a well-remembered figure, who is tenderly\r\nregarding me. That look, which seemed to spring from the depth of a\r\nhuman soul, came from the eyes of Saïmira, my charming chimpanzee, who\r\nendeavoured anew to make me comprehend that I was to follow her by again\r\npulling me by the arm, accompanying this movement with a significant\r\ngesture. Finding that I still resisted she uttered several low groans,\r\nand commenced licking my hands. She had, one might say, spoken first,\r\nand begged afterwards. I no longer doubted that I was running some\r\ngreat danger from which she wished to save me. I therefore decided to\r\nfollow her, and no sooner did she perceive my intention than her joy was\r\nintense. As we walked side by side through the bushes she looked at me,\r\nand lowered her head. I divined her meaning, and inclined mine. It was\r\nevidently dangerous for me to be seen. After a quarter of an hour of this\r\nsilent marching through the tall brushwood we arrived at a spot which I\r\nfancied to be in the rear of the houses seen by me from afar, and the\r\nsight of which had inspired me with such joy and confidence. Saïmira\r\nstood still. What could be her object? It was to show me on her left a\r\nrow of cages, of which all, except one, were open and empty. Saïmira\r\nwent up to the closed cage, and then returned, and drew me towards it.\r\nI looked through the bars, and there saw my old friend Mococo, the\r\nchimpanzee, whom I had sold with Saïmira on the day of my great sale to\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell.\r\n\r\nMy first act was to open the door of the cage that I might behold my old\r\nfavourite free. No sooner is he free than poor Mococo hesitated whether\r\nto go to Saïmira or to me, whom he at once recognised. His affections\r\nare divided. At last he runs up to me, and rests his head for several\r\nseconds upon my neck just like a little child. After having passed his\r\nhands gently over my face, and rubbed his muzzle against my cheeks, he\r\nthrew himself on the ground, and laid his trembling paw on Saïmira’s\r\nneck, whilst Saïmira, in her turn, placed her hand on him. The most\r\naffectionate confidences were then exchanged between these two creatures,\r\nwho had evidently suffered much from their hard separation, since one was\r\nfree and the other a captive.\r\n\r\nThis affecting scene lasted for well-nigh a quarter of an hour, when all\r\nat once Saïmira raised her ear with anxiety, and drew it back ruffled\r\nwith fright. With a rapid movement she thrust Mococo back into his cage\r\nagain, and giving me a glance, which I was at no loss to comprehend,\r\nsince I had known for a long time how to interpret the signs of these\r\nanimals, and by which I understood her to implore me to draw the bolt\r\nquickly on the poor prisoner. I of course did so. She had evidently heard\r\na noise. I listened and heard it also, and recognised in it the hoarse\r\ngrunting of Karabouffi.\r\n\r\nSaïmira’s terror, which was evidently inspired by the too close proximity\r\nof the big baboon, convinced me that it was he who held Mococo captive.\r\nI also suspected from this circumstance that Karabouffi was at once the\r\nconqueror and ruler of the island on which it had been my misfortune\r\nto be cast. What part then did my own species play in relation to this\r\nmysterious society, in which, day by day, I found myself more and more\r\nentangled?\r\n\r\nPoor Saïmira was, of course, incapable of enlightening me. All that her\r\naffection for me suggested was to draw me away, so that I might avoid\r\nencountering Karabouffi the First. When, therefore, she led the way I\r\nfollowed her again. The road which she took was directly opposite to that\r\nby which one might have reasonably expected the baboon would come.\r\n\r\nWe doubled one corner of the row of houses whilst he turned the other on\r\nhis way to pay a visit to the cage of his rival—now his prisoner. The day\r\nbegan to grow dim. We walked without being observed past the front of\r\nthe houses which I had believed to be those of the English station, and\r\nwhich looked so pleasant when seen at a distance. A nearer view, however,\r\nbrought to light a scene of desolation that promised a new surprise to\r\nme. In the first place, the windows were all broken, and the frames\r\ndemolished, and, more or less, wrenched away from their hinges.\r\n\r\nHanging out, at the end of long sticks and a crowd of flag-staffs,\r\nfrom the broken windows of the first story, was a most miscellaneous\r\ncollection of articles—torn uniforms, leathern stocks, cravats, boots,\r\nbelts, odd pairs of shoes, hats with their tops torn out, empty bottles,\r\ntrousers, towels, rags of all colours, any number of shirts, and even a\r\nfew flags.\r\n\r\nIn Heaven’s name, I mentally exclaimed, who has committed these acts of\r\nincredible folly? Who has produced this utter devastation, the like of\r\nwhich is only to be met with after the sacking of a town, or a raid on\r\nthe part of a horde of savages?\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, thought I, that the apes—though the effects of their\r\nclaws and their perversity were visible everywhere—could have made\r\nthemselves masters, either by surprise or force, of a garrison composed\r\nof brave sailors and excellent officers; that they could have massacred\r\nevery living man among them, and have then installed themselves in their\r\ndwellings and appropriated all their uniforms, furniture, and flags.\r\n\r\nSaïmira’s pressing solicitations to me to proceed prevented me from\r\ncontinuing my reflections, and ere many minutes had elapsed she and I had\r\ndisappeared in the dense shade of a neighbouring wood, where we walked\r\nfor more than three hours under the dark leaves of the banyans.\r\n\r\nIt was only after having seen me take refuge in a natural grotto formed\r\nof rocks clothed with thick moss and those thousand vegetable productions\r\nwhich cover the ground of Australia, that Saïmira decided to leave me.\r\nBut before she departed, she gave me a look full of fear and compassion,\r\nan eloquent farewell, which I interpreted into an express recommendation\r\nto me not to leave my retreat.\r\n\r\nWhy did I not follow this advice? Simply because, after eight days’\r\nseclusion in the grotto, I grew tired of it, and not even Saïmira’s\r\nattentive care, although she came to see me every day, could reconcile\r\nme to it. I shall never forget the efforts she made to raise her\r\nintelligence in some degree to the level of my own. She would caress me,\r\nwould now and then sleep with her two little arms twined round my neck,\r\nor while I was asleep myself, would go and gather from the topmost\r\nbranches of the trees fruit which she would place at the entrance to my\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone weariness which decided me to leave my place of\r\nconcealment, where I lived without doubt in security; my dignity as a\r\nman also urged me to this course. I was ashamed to be held, as it were,\r\nin check by certain inferior creatures, authority over whom nature has\r\ndelegated to our race. Moreover, to pass my life in this grotto seemed an\r\nintolerable idea. I thought to myself that I must leave it some day or\r\nother, and that I might just as well leave it at once; and this is how it\r\nwas I left.\r\n\r\nI had been accustomed to roam some distance from my cave after nightfall,\r\nboth for exercise and to seek for wood-pigeons’ eggs, which I cooked in a\r\nhole dug in the sand, at the bottom of which I was accustomed to make up\r\na fire.\r\n\r\nThe matches which, being a smoker, I had about me when I was shipwrecked,\r\nenabled me to kindle a fire whenever I required one. Thanks to the leaden\r\nbox which contained these matches, the sea water had not injured them in\r\nthe slightest degree, whilst my tobacco, on the contrary, had suffered\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nOn the last evening of my stay in the forest, while standing at the\r\nentrance of my grotto, I perceived, some distance off, a fire like that\r\nwhich I had seen the day following my shipwreck. Who is it, I asked\r\nmyself, that lights up these great fires? It cannot be the work of apes,\r\nit must be done by men, and yet I dared no longer believe in their\r\nexistence on this enigmatical island, since on this point I had been so\r\noften deceived. I directed my steps in a straight line towards the fire,\r\nwhich I imagined to be situated somewhere between my grotto and the\r\nsacked houses of the English station. In less than an hour-and-a-half’s\r\nwalking, I found myself getting nearer and nearer to it, and when I was\r\nonly some hundred paces off from it the ground, till then level, rose\r\nin a steep incline. The soil crumbled and rattled under my feet, and\r\nI concluded that I had reached the side of a volcano, and that I was\r\nwalking over the old lava. This, however, did not astonish me, for I\r\nknew well enough that in nearly all the islands of Oceania there are\r\nvolcanoes, either extinct or in a state of eruption. But how was it\r\nthat I had observed these flames only on two occasions? How was it that\r\nthey had disappeared to burst forth again after an interval of eight\r\ndays? This was not in accordance with the usual course of these physical\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes all my uncertainties ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    Finding a volcano.—New peril to which I am exposed.—The\r\n    merchant is recognised by his old merchandise.—Three guttural\r\n    cries.—The living garland.—It swings to and fro, and then\r\n    performs a furious rotatory movement over the crater of a\r\n    blazing volcano.—My thoughts at this moment.—I am flung to the\r\n    ground, and swoon away.—On recovering, I am ushered into the\r\n    presence of Karabouffi the First, whom I find transformed into\r\n    a bird.—Monkey scribes and living telegraphic communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the cone which I had just reached a most extraordinary\r\nspectacle awaited me. Myriads of apes, silent and immovable until they\r\nperceived me, hovered round the crest of the crater of a little volcano,\r\nwhich had evidently not been in a state of eruption for a considerable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe flames which it belched forth were, I found, the result of a\r\nformidable combustion fed by troops of these creatures, who were busily\r\nengaged in throwing into this yawning gulf branches after branches of\r\nmaple-trees, shrubs torn up by the roots, and heaps of long dry leaves,\r\nwhich they passed from one to the other with incredible rapidity, just\r\nas sailors when loading a ship pass from hand to hand the multitude of\r\npackages which have to be transferred from the quay to the hold. The\r\nfuel, consisting of branches, roots, bark, and leaves, which they were\r\nflinging into the opening of the craters came, as I discovered, from a\r\ndistance. The destruction of trees, and the passage from hand to hand\r\nof boughs and bark stripped from them, went on without ceasing. The\r\ninexhaustible fire, like the indefatigable arms in motion, never once\r\nappeared to slacken. It was almost enough to turn one’s brain to observe\r\nthe flames lightening up from below thousands of shining eyes, twinkling\r\nlike electric sparks; to see the agitated beards, the perspiring bodies,\r\nthe shrivelled countenances, and the twisted legs; to see the hairy\r\narms extend themselves, receive their burthen, and cast it into the\r\ncrater; and to see, moreover, arranged in an immense circle around these\r\npanting workmen, thousands upon thousands of spectators, grave and\r\nserious-looking as dervishes adoring fire.\r\n\r\nBut whom could these horrible apes have seen practise this organised work\r\nof destruction, that, following the example set them, they should now\r\ncontinue it as though without the power to desist, like machines which\r\nknow not how to stop after they have once been set in motion? Chance\r\nenlightened me on this point some time afterwards.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Polydorus Marasquin would have been less surprised to\r\n    see apes act together with this unison of will and thorough\r\n    unanimity of idea, which seemed to him to belong exclusively\r\n    to the faculties of man, if he had read the following passage\r\n    from Kolo’s _Description of the Cape of Good Hope_:—“This is\r\n    the manner in which the apes pillage an orchard, a garden, or\r\n    a vineyard. They set forth on these expeditions in troops; one\r\n    detachment enters the inclosure, whilst another remains on the\r\n    watch to give notice of the approach of danger. The remainder\r\n    are placed outside the garden at a moderate distance from each\r\n    other, so as to form a sort of line, which stretches from the\r\n    place of pillage to that appointed for the rendezvous. When all\r\n    have taken up their positions, the baboons commence the work\r\n    of pillage, and throw to those who are in waiting just outside\r\n    the garden the melons, apples, pears, &c., as they gather them;\r\n    these apes, in their turn, throw the fruit to those stationed\r\n    nearest to them, and so they are passed along the entire\r\n    length of the line, which generally ends on the summit of some\r\n    mountain. If the sentinels perceive any one approaching, they\r\n    utter a particular cry, at which signal the entire troop will\r\n    scamper off with astonishing rapidity.”\r\n\r\nI have said that all these apes were silent as the grave until they\r\ncaught sight of me. No sooner, however, did they perceive me than this\r\nsilence was broken. Callot’s necromantic pencil, or rather his diabolical\r\ngraver, which gave to us “The Temptation of St. Anthony,” is necessary to\r\ndepict what happened to me at this ineffaceable moment of my existence.\r\n\r\nAt first a noise, so much like that of a hurricane that it caused me to\r\nthrow myself flat on the ground, succeeded to the death-like silence with\r\nwhich these creatures were regarding the sight of the blazing volcano\r\nbefore they were disturbed by my presence.\r\n\r\nThey were welcoming me.\r\n\r\nTheir eternal enemy, man, was in their midst.\r\n\r\nAnd a man, too, who had sold apes!\r\n\r\nA man who had even sold several of those present when at Macao.\r\n\r\nA man who had forced them to beat tambourines and leap through hoops.\r\n\r\nA man who had sometimes flogged them to make them dance with a rose\r\nbehind the ear, a shepherd’s hat on the head, and a crook in the hand.\r\n\r\nA man who had also cruelly deprived them of food and drink, because they\r\nwould not put on scarlet breeches and ruffles, and bow and scrape in the\r\nancient French fashion.\r\n\r\nWhat ought I not to expect?\r\n\r\nKarabouffi the First, seated on the block of lava, was presiding over\r\nthis gathering—as for the matter of that, he presided over everything\r\nin this island, which had become subjected, I know not how, to his\r\nsovereignty. His ministers, as we have already seen, were only his\r\nservants and executioners.\r\n\r\nI had been, as I have already said, recognised.\r\n\r\nAfter this bewildering noise of which I have just spoken all my old\r\ncaptives of Macao rushed upon me; their companions hastened to follow\r\ntheir example. I felt that I was about to be torn into as many pieces as\r\nmy unfortunate cravat.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that I caught sight of the word Halcyon, the name\r\nof Vice-Admiral Campbell’s frigate, on the buttons of the coats worn by\r\nthe leaders of this odious troop. The reader may judge of my astonishment\r\nat this discovery. Where was I? In the name of goodness, what had\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\nThis I should probably never have known but for the cry uttered by\r\nKarabouffi at the very moment that I was disappearing under a mountain of\r\nbaboons, apes, mandrills, magots, and ourang-outangs.\r\n\r\nThe thousand and one instantly let go their hold.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi evidently had other intentions respecting me.\r\n\r\nHe uttered three distinct guttural cries, which were listened to with\r\nmarked attention.\r\n\r\nThe order had gone forth, it was now about to be executed, and this is\r\nthe way in which his behest was accomplished:—\r\n\r\nOn a signal from Karabouffi, these drolls of creation joined themselves\r\ntogether like bundles of snakes, and tying themselves to one another\r\nby their tails rapidly formed two chains. One of these living chains\r\nentwined itself round my neck, the other twisted itself about my legs,\r\nand I found myself, without being able to offer the least resistance, the\r\nconnecting link, as it were, of these two chains, which soon formed only\r\none, a kind of garland of apes, animated and convulsive. As soon as this\r\noperation was completed, the end of the chain which represented what one\r\nmay style the head threw itself with the swiftness of an arrow to the\r\nother side of the crater; the end representing the tail did not move from\r\nwhere it was, and a giddy swinging movement at once commenced. Picture to\r\nyourself if you can my sad and ridiculous situation, swinging from right\r\nto left and from left to right over a fire a hundred feet broad, all\r\nsmoking and blazing beneath me.\r\n\r\nEach succeeding oscillation became quicker and quicker, owing, I presume,\r\nto the increasing recklessness of my tormentors, until I was swung from\r\ncurve to curve, sixty feet on one side and sixty feet on the other;\r\nthen—but how is it possible for me in the state of mind in which I\r\nthen was to have calculated this frightful rate of progression? Twenty\r\nthousand spectators, or rather twenty thousand grimaces, twenty thousand\r\ncontortions, fifty ranks deep, surrounded the opening of the crater,\r\nabove which I was floating, looking like a forest of skins dotted with\r\nblack and yellow muzzles, and bristling with teeth which gnashed and\r\nchattered without ceasing; and from one extremity to the other gigantic\r\nmagots, quadrumanous constables armed with sticks, moved about to keep\r\norder during the entertainment—and what an entertainment, too, for even\r\nan ape to derive gratification from! At one moment I believed myself\r\nthrown into the clouds, at the next I felt the heat of the fire scorching\r\nmy back. I say nothing of the pain which I suffered from being wrapped\r\nabout and bound by those nervous cords which cut into my very skin. And,\r\nworse than all, I was not even at the end of my punishment.\r\n\r\nThe formidable swinging movement increased, the garland of apes, of which\r\nI formed part, soon overleaped its most elevated point of ascension,\r\nand then it was no longer a simple alternating movement, more or less\r\nperilous, that I had to undergo, but a rotatory motion, first rapid, then\r\nfurious, and at last terrible. I had been, as it were, the balance of a\r\npendulum; I was now a cart-wheel, the sails of a windmill, the stone in\r\na sling; and I turned, and turned, and turned till I became first white,\r\nthen red, then purple, then violet, and at last blue, and had quite lost\r\nmy senses. I cried out; my cries of suffering, of despair, and fear were\r\nlost amidst the squealing huzzas and furious shriekings of these myriads\r\nof evil beings. When they had shaken and whirled me about to their\r\nhearts’ content, they brought their atrocious farce to a termination in\r\nthe following manner:—Giving me a final and more furious shaking than\r\nany I had before experienced—ah! it makes my blood run cold to think of\r\nit—to the extreme curve of the chain, which, when it had attained the\r\nhighest degree of gyratory violence, they all at once snapped asunder,\r\nbreaking it at the centre, where I was fixed. The consequence was that\r\nI was flying like a ball across the crater, high above the enthusiastic\r\nspectators—above everything, in fact, to a distance of one or two hundred\r\nyards. Heaven only knows how I escaped being smashed to pieces on\r\nfalling! Doubtless there were still further torments in store for me.\r\n\r\nWhat were your thoughts, perhaps my readers will ask, while you were\r\nthus travelling through space in a manner so contrary to the usual\r\nhabits of our kind? Why, I thought how very cruel we are when, to amuse\r\nourselves, we send up cats or dogs in the car of a small balloon, and how\r\nvery blamable I had been myself in one day attaching a poor kitten, who\r\nafterwards died from fright, to the tail of a large kite, for the purpose\r\nof amusing the idlers of Macao. I had been in my turn attached to the\r\ntail of a kite. What right had I to complain?\r\n\r\nOn coming to myself—and I am entirely ignorant how long the swoon which\r\nfollowed my horrible fall lasted—I perceived two mandrills of the most\r\nsavage kind on guard, sword in hand, near me, imitating, so far as parody\r\nimitates truth, the gait and stiffness of English soldiers. Through want\r\nof experience, instead of confining themselves to placing a gaiter on\r\neach leg, every one of the mandrills had in addition placed a gaiter\r\non each arm. I attributed this grotesque addition to simple ignorance,\r\nsince there could be no such grade among apes as clothing colonels,\r\nready at all times to decree any absurd addition to the soldier’s\r\nuniform, provided they could share the profit derived from it with the\r\ncontractors. Slight as had been my opportunities of observing this\r\nautomatic society, I nevertheless endeavoured to account to myself in\r\na vague sort of way how it was that it came to offer a copy, fantastic\r\nand distorted though it might be, of the life of civilised man. Those\r\nuniform-buttons, already recognised by me in my hour of torture,\r\nfurnished me with a clue. Unquestionably these half-intelligent animals\r\nand the men whose garments they were dragging about had lived together.\r\nMy inference seemed so far undeniable. I had, however, still to discover\r\nhow it was that the one had managed to obtain possession of the property\r\nof the other; but this was a question by no means easy to resolve all at\r\nonce, particularly in the uncomfortable position in which I was placed.\r\nJust let the reader try to reflect when his head, the seat of reflection,\r\nis in perpetual fear of being broken by a blow from a bludgeon.\r\n\r\nThe two sentinels with the four gaiters, seeing me open my eyes,\r\nsignalled to me to follow them. I mustered up all my strength and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThey conducted me in the direction of the devastated buildings which had\r\nexcited my surprise some eight or ten days previously, when I was under\r\nthe protection of the interesting Saïmira.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Saïmira?\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Mococo?\r\n\r\nWhat was about to become of me?\r\n\r\nMy two guardians introduced me, with some sharp blows dealt out to me\r\nwith the flat side of their sabres, into one of the houses, the exterior\r\nof which was more pretentious in appearance than any of the others, and\r\nwhich I supposed, on this account, to have been the head-quarters of the\r\nstation—the residence, in fact, of Vice-Admiral Campbell. The interior of\r\nthe admiral’s house scarcely differed, so far as the desolate condition\r\nto which it was reduced was concerned, from the others. A kind of order,\r\nhowever, reigned in the midst of this lamentable chaos. For instance, the\r\npictures, after having been removed from their hooks, had been placed\r\nback again, but upside down. I acknowledge that, so far as many of the\r\npictures were concerned, this was a matter of no moment whatever, while\r\nfor others it was a positive advantage. I should not be surprised if\r\npeople generally became of my opinion after trying the effect of this\r\nreversing process on certain modern pictures in their collections.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi the First, warned of my arrival by the chattering of my\r\ncustodians, rushed up to me. The sight of the hated baboon made me feel\r\ntimid, more timid, indeed, than usual, and what added in some degree\r\nto my fear was seeing him covered from head to foot with feathers. The\r\nsight of this ape, transformed as it were, to all appearances, into\r\na bird, naturally enough filled me at first with great surprise. But\r\nhaving examined him more attentively, I perceived that the thousands\r\nof feathers under which his hairy skin seemed to have disappeared were\r\nwriting-quills, which he stuck under his arms, upon his ears, in his\r\nmouth, and even up his nose, as well as fastened all over his wrinkled\r\nskin. In moving towards me some of the feathers fell out, and I noticed\r\nthat most of them had been made into pens. The two ourang-outangs who\r\naccompanied him, and who appeared to be his prime ministers, were\r\ncovered, like their master, from head to foot with feathers.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi preceded me into the principal room, which it seems he\r\nhad left in order to receive me; and there I saw a hundred sapajous\r\nin a state of intense nervous excitement, and apparently very busy,\r\nsprawling over desks, dipping their pens and very often their hands into\r\ninkstands without number, and scribbling upon sheets of paper laid before\r\nthem—imitating, in fact, the copying-clerks in the public offices at\r\nMacao. They worked as if by steam; the pens scratched incessantly, and\r\nsheets after sheets of paper flew about in all directions.\r\n\r\nWhen one of these sheets of paper was sufficiently scratched and scrawled\r\nover it was passed to some more venerable sapajou, who signed it, and\r\nin his turn passed it on to some sapajou still more grave-looking,\r\nwho again signed the paper and fixed his seal to it. Being afterwards\r\nhanded to one of the crowd of sapajous who waited outside, the paper\r\nwas transmitted without loss of time from sapajou to sapajou placed at\r\ncertain distances, precisely as I had seen them when they were occupied\r\nin throwing wood into the furnace, into which I had had a narrow escape\r\nof being thrown myself. After a lapse of something like ten minutes, the\r\npaper which had traversed the island by means of this telegraphic system\r\nof communication came into Karabouffi’s hands, who, after having applied\r\nit to the purposes of a pocket-handkerchief, handed it over to an old\r\nmangabey, whom he had invested with the dignity of Keeper of the Court\r\nRecords.\r\n\r\nIt was very evident to me that these savage creatures, after the\r\ndeparture, flight, or perhaps extermination of the English colony, had\r\ntaken possession of all the official paper and pens which they could\r\nfind, and of the vice-admiral’s seal; and that, in servile imitation\r\nof what they had so frequently witnessed, they were despatching at\r\nrandom orders from all sides, thereby, without intending it, offering\r\na witty comment on the ordinary practice of European bureaucracy,\r\nthat pest of civilisation which devours time, money, and men, and\r\ninvariably terminates by a paper with which, were we accustomed to paper\r\npocket-handkerchiefs like the Japanese, the last receiver of it might\r\njust as well wipe his nose for any better use he could put it to.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi, in the most imperious way, threw in my face several quires\r\nof paper and several parcels of quills. The expressive look which he\r\nafterwards gave me implied, as I imagined, that I was to occupy myself\r\nwithout uttering a word with these packets of pens and quires of paper,\r\nprecisely like his other clerks, who were working away at such a\r\ndesperate rate before my eyes.\r\n\r\nDuring three times twenty-four hours I was not permitted either to leave\r\nmy place or to let my pen rest. I was compelled under pain of all that\r\nis terrible to blacken ream after ream of paper, and when the virgin\r\nwhiteness of these sheets had entirely disappeared under the clouds of\r\nink with which I overlaid them, one of the strange scribes at my elbow\r\ntook the papers from me and gave them, as I have already described,\r\nto a corps of apes, charged with the duty of conveying them round the\r\nisland. For seventy-two hours I did not get even a wink of sleep, since\r\nmy enemies, endowed for the most part with the faculty of seeing in the\r\ndark, whenever I was about to succumb to slumber, cruelly pinched my\r\narms, pulled my hair, kicked me in the back, or scratched my face with\r\ntheir sharp claws, so as to keep me wide awake. What horrible torture!\r\n\r\nOh, how sincerely at this moment did I pity those numbers of young men\r\ncondemned by the misfortune of their birth or the stupidity of their\r\nrelations to spend their lives in doing nothing but ply their pens from\r\nmorning to evening within the four walls of some dreary office!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    Bell-ringing by the monkeys.—Disorder in Monkey Villas.—Hungry,\r\n    I discover stores.—His Majesty in a jar of quinces.—Scrambling\r\n    for nuts.—Monkeys tipsy.—Fear of their intoxicated\r\n    revels.—Night falls as I am in the midst of a terrible\r\n    uproar.—I discover candles and lucifer matches.—The monkeys\r\n    find them also.—Candle-dance by the apes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth day of this singular penitential ordeal I was startled at\r\nhearing a bell ring, and immediately fancied myself saved, for I could\r\nattribute only to one of my own species the faculty of employing this\r\nmethod of signalling. Flinging down my pen I abandoned my cruel labour,\r\nand ran at the top of my speed towards the place whence I supposed the\r\nsound proceeded. I decided to die rather than remain any longer in the\r\nplace where I had been kept by constraint and blows for three days\r\nand nights. My guards did not dare to hold me back. I arrived without\r\nhalting at the foot of the post above which the bell was hung, when my\r\ndisappointment was complete at finding that it was not a man but an ape\r\nwho was pulling the rope.\r\n\r\nThe post of the bell was fixed at the corner of a large courtyard, the\r\nfour sides of which were composed of ranges of elegant apartments. This\r\ncourtyard received both air and light through an immense awning of\r\nrose-coloured cloth, filled out by the wind, and enjoyed a perpetual\r\nfreshness arising from a natural basin of water which was situated in\r\nthe very centre of the square. Luxuriant turf, with beds of shrubs and\r\nflowers, formed a border to this refreshing pool. Tied together in\r\nbouquets by a kind of weed, a tropical hair-like plant, bamboos grew with\r\ntheir delicate trunks and glossy foliage to a height of sixty feet. In\r\nIndia this cool part of a house, where one really manages to breathe, is\r\ncalled the verandah. Did India take the idea of verandahs from the Moors,\r\nor did the Moors borrow verandahs from the Hindoos to introduce them into\r\nSpain and Portugal? I cannot say. All I know is that the inhabitants dine\r\nin these places during the heat of the day, walk in them of an evening,\r\nand often make them their sleeping apartment for the night. Divans from\r\nCabul, carpets from Bagdad, mats from Ceylon, and Manilla hammocks are\r\nthe ordinary furniture of these verandahs.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi, who had taken possession without ceremony of the finest house\r\nof all, had the wit to choose the verandah for himself and court to\r\nreside in. Profiting by the long tables laid out for the officers of the\r\nstation, he and his suite occasionally took their meals there, though to\r\nbe sure without ever thinking of changing the tablecloth.\r\n\r\nOn entering this verandah I found myself in the midst of the most\r\ndistressing disorder that one can possibly imagine. There were plates\r\nscattered about in all directions, silver dishes lying here and there,\r\nbroken china, smashed decanters, forks stuck by the prongs into the\r\ntable, bottles lying on their sides, and glasses piled up one within the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe bell which I had heard was to announce dinner.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi strutted into the room and took a place in the very middle of\r\nthe table, between a soup-plate and cruet-stand; his favourites seated\r\nthemselves around—some on the table, others underneath.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that, owing to the hunger which I endured, I felt\r\nindisposed to criticise the behaviour of the guests and the postures\r\nin which they placed themselves too closely. Besides, I could not but\r\nremember that among the nations of the world the etiquette of the\r\ndinner-table has not yet been reduced to anything like a system of\r\nuniformity. For instance, the English commonly dine without napkins;\r\nthe French invariably with; the Chinese eat with little ivory sticks;\r\nOrientals with their hands instead of forks; the Thibetans eat standing\r\nup; the Romans ate reclining; the American Indians eat with fish-bones\r\nshaped like needles. Why, then, should I find fault with these creatures,\r\nwho simply ate as instinct taught them?\r\n\r\nOnly it was necessary to have something to eat. The vegetables which my\r\ntable companions eagerly devoured, and which they occasionally sought\r\nto thrust into my mouth, were neither palatable nor satisfying. I was\r\nsuffering the most cruel hunger. Whilst casting my sad and haggard eyes\r\nround the verandah, almost every window of which indicated a distinct\r\nroom, and thinking of the many capital repasts which the English\r\nofficers had here partaken of, an inscription over a window a little\r\nway off met my sight. It consisted of these words, in black letters on\r\na white ground:—“Kitchens of the officers of the staff.” I rushed in\r\nthe direction far quicker than I had done to the sound of the bell.\r\nKitchens! a plurality of kitchens! There were of course several kitchens,\r\nthen! It is needless to say that I was followed in my impetuous rush\r\nby Karabouffi’s staff, who were at this moment a curious rather than a\r\nhostile crowd. This general curiosity was in fact my great protection\r\nagainst the habitual perversity of my quadrumanous tyrants.\r\n\r\nIn my impetuosity I penetrated into a large and handsome apartment of\r\nthe verandah, evidently the reception-room, and which had been by no\r\nmeans so badly treated as other parts of the building. The arm-chairs\r\nappeared to be only half stripped of their coverings; the chandelier\r\nand ormolu brackets of several branches still decorated the ceiling and\r\nwalls. Various articles of furniture, the use of which the ravagers had\r\nno doubt been unable to divine, were left intact. These were a piano,\r\nan accordion, and a guitar. I judged from these various signs that the\r\nrecollection of the beatings which they must have frequently received\r\nat the hands of the cooks, their natural enemies, whom they are always\r\nrobbing, had induced the apes to keep clear of the kitchens.\r\n\r\nFrom the reception-room I passed into the dining-hall, situated at the\r\nback of the verandah, and from the dining-hall into the kitchen. Alas!\r\nweeks, months, perhaps, had elapsed since the English settlers had\r\ndisappeared, and I ought not to have expected to have seen haunches\r\nof venison, turkeys, pheasants, and hares roasting on the spit. The\r\nkitchen fire was extinguished, and all was cold and desolate. My apes had\r\nevidently passed through here. But, apes as they were, and will always\r\nbe, they had not found out how to open the cupboards. The claws of the\r\ndepredators had left their traces behind them, written in long furrows\r\nacross the doors—that was all. I opened one cupboard after another.\r\nProvidence had evidently guided me, for I found them filled with cases of\r\n_pâté-de-foie gras_, and all kinds of preserved meats, poultry, fish, and\r\nvegetables, with boxes of sardines and pots of jams, and jars of fruits\r\nand sweetmeats. Guess if I didn’t seize with avidity on these treasures.\r\n\r\nPrudence suggested to me not to be ungrateful. I therefore offered a\r\ncolossal jar of preserved quinces to his Majesty King Karabouffi, who\r\nforthwith thrust his head into it right up to the shoulders; but his\r\nsubjects, envious and jealous at this proceeding, immediately commenced\r\nto draw him out by the legs and tail. Karabouffi, however, held tight,\r\nand he and the jar resisted their efforts with success. Nevertheless,\r\nI am quite of the opinion that a prudent sovereign ought not to indulge\r\ntoo freely in sweetmeats in the presence of his subjects. The strife\r\ncontinued; the jar at length began to give way. A revolution was\r\ninevitably about to spring from this trivial, this insignificant incident.\r\n\r\nNow, for my part, I considered that a revolution at this particular\r\nmoment would in all probability not turn out to my advantage. One\r\nKarabouffi dead, twenty other Karabouffis would spring up to succeed him.\r\nThis was easily to be perceived, and what was equally certain was that\r\nthe last Karabouffi would be sure to be worse than his predecessors; so\r\nfor the purpose of preventing such a catastrophe, this is what I did: I\r\nemptied a bag of nuts on the ground. Suddenly courtiers and subjects,\r\nleaving their lord and master to partake of the preserved quinces to his\r\nheart’s content, rushed after the nuts, for which they scrambled like a\r\nparcel of schoolboys. It is not a bad plan—indeed, it is rather a method\r\nof sound policy—to throw from time to time a few handfuls of nuts among\r\npeople who are quarrelling.\r\n\r\nIn presence of the nuts the general discontent vanished. I profited by\r\nthis circumstance to taste a few of those delicious preserves which\r\nhad fallen into my hands. I was obliged while eating them to hold the\r\ncupboard door only partially open, for fear that the spies by whom I was\r\nsurrounded should desire to share these dainties with me. Had I given\r\nthem the chance, they would have whipped everything off in the twinkling\r\nof an eye. But I was only taking half measures of protection, as I am now\r\nabout to show. After having eaten my fill, I took a bottle of wine from\r\na hamper, broke the neck off it, and commenced to drink. I drank with\r\nsatisfaction, with pleasure—indeed, I may say with ecstasy. But in my\r\necstasy I forgot myself, and left the cupboard door wide open. Whilst I\r\nwas counting the stars, after the manner of Sancho Panza, my companions\r\ninsinuated themselves into the cupboard, fell on to the hampers of wine,\r\nseized the bottles as they had seen me do: the reader can divine the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nOnce intoxicated, they called one another names in ape’s language, which\r\nwas enough to make any one tremble; they sent plates flying at one\r\nanother’s heads, and somehow or other never missed their aim; they struck\r\none another on the back with the empty bottles until they shivered them\r\ninto fragments. “Ah,” said I to myself, “Nature has done well to indicate\r\nto man the constant moderation which he ought to bring, and which he\r\nreally does bring, to the gratification of his desires. As a matter of\r\ncourse he never falls into those scandalous excesses in which I saw these\r\nmiserable imitations of our species so readily indulge.”\r\n\r\nI felt proud at this new proof of our superiority over the monkey tribe.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, I know, that men have occasionally forgotten themselves\r\nat dessert, and behaved with less politeness than they ordinarily do.\r\nPeople will cite, for instance, the cases of Alexander, who killed Clytus\r\nafter a drinking bout; and of Charles XII., who boxed his mother’s\r\nears on leaving table; and of King Christian of Denmark. But see how\r\nrare the examples are! One is obliged to search history to its lowest\r\ndepths for them. I am aware it has been pretended that our most painful\r\ndiseases result from the too great fondness which we are said to have\r\nfor the pleasures of the table, and from our partiality for alcoholic\r\ndrinks. This proves, however, absolutely nothing, for these are at best\r\nbut mere suppositions. Tell me, if you please, where I shall look for a\r\ncounterpart of the frightful reality I have just described, and which I\r\nsaw passing before my eyes.\r\n\r\nI might have hit upon even still more flattering comparisons for my own\r\nspecies, but night was coming on, and I watched it approach with an\r\ninexpressible fear; for I had no longer the resource of hiding myself in\r\nthe woods and escaping my enemies. They were all present, they were all\r\nmore or less intoxicated, and I was hemmed in by them on all sides.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that my position was anything but an agreeable one in\r\nthe midst of this maddened pandemonium, giving itself up in the darkness\r\nof the night to the most frightful eccentricities. As this darkness\r\nincreased so did my fear. Every means of flight were cut off from me. I\r\nexpected to be strangled, choked, or torn in pieces on the spot. Not a\r\nsingle avenue of escape was open to me—no, not one!\r\n\r\nIn the excess of my alarm the idea suddenly occurred to me of hiding\r\nmyself away in one of the cupboards, and by this means escaping the\r\nfate which threatened me. It was while seeking to put in execution this\r\nimpossible project, considering the narrow space into which I should have\r\nbeen obliged to squeeze myself, that I displaced the lid of a chest,\r\nand found my hand in contact with some solid substance. I pass my hand\r\ncarefully over it, I examine it so far as a doubtful light permits me,\r\nwhen judge of my delight at discovering that it was a packet of wax\r\ncandles. The chest was evidently filled with them. I immediately drew my\r\nbox of lucifers from my pocket and lighted one. Delivered from the horror\r\nof darkness in the unhappy condition in which I was, I trembled all over\r\nwith emotion. What a delicious surprise! What joy! Unfortunately I did\r\nnot remark, when closing the cupboard that my spies might not play me\r\nthe same trick as they had done with the wine, that I had locked one of\r\nthem in. He uttered a cry of alarm, on hearing which I instantly opened\r\nthe door, or it might have turned out badly for me. All was over. My\r\ncaptive, once free, placed himself in the opening of the door so that I\r\ncould not shut it without crushing him. The others, profiting by this\r\naccident, immediately made a rush for the cupboard, and pillaged the\r\nchest in the twinkling of an eye. Behold them all lighting their candles\r\nat mine and waving them over their heads, dancing about with delight\r\nat the continued repetition of these fantastic flames, with which their\r\nlittle Satanic eyes were at once dazzled and fascinated. Alas! I only\r\nfell from one state of fright into another. Now I stood a chance of being\r\nburnt like a faggot, for they carried their lighted tapers so recklessly\r\nthat they had already commenced to singe the skins of each other. A happy\r\ninspiration, drawn from the new danger which I had myself called down, at\r\nthis moment took possession of me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    An energetic pianiste.—Vigorous dancers.—A bevy of quadrumanous\r\n    beauties.—The parasol polka.—Amatory tomfooleries.—I am\r\n    compelled to take part in a new musical air.—Am commanded to\r\n    climb up a tall pole.—Am forced to jump through hoops, throw\r\n    somersaults, and cut capers.—Am indebted to Saïmira for a\r\n    respite.\r\n\r\n\r\nI traversed the dining-hall, passed into the reception-room, where I\r\nplaced one of my candles on a window-seat; I then lighted a second, which\r\nI fixed elsewhere. Having observed me do this—what, indeed, did they\r\nnot observe?—they hastened to place their candles wherever they could\r\ndiscover a support for them. I congratulated myself on my success; the\r\ncandles had ceased to play any further an incendiary part in the apish\r\norgie. No sooner, however, had they done this than they appeared to\r\nrecall to mind that they had seen the room lighted up in this fashion\r\nbefore—doubtlessly on some occasion when the vice-admiral gave a _soirée_\r\nor a ball. They exchanged glances with each other, and in the twinkling\r\nof an eye climbed up on one another’s backs and placed the candles in the\r\nchandeliers and in the ormolu brackets fixed against the walls.\r\n\r\nIf I had required any further proof that my apes must have seen both\r\nballs and evening parties given in this room, it was supplied me when\r\none of them, happier in his efforts of memory than the rest of his\r\ncompanions, sprang on to the keys of the piano, and struck them with\r\nhis fore hands. He had evidently seen a piano played. Judging from\r\nthe enthusiastic contortions of his hearers that his performance was\r\nappreciated, he commenced to strike the keys with his hind hands, when,\r\nfinding himself applauded still more by his auditory, he proceeded to\r\nbeat the keys not only with his four brawny hands, but with his elbows\r\nand his knees, his hairy head, his bearded back, and ended at last by\r\nsitting down upon the instrument, and, rising and falling with an adagio\r\nmovement, produced the final notes of his fantasia after the style of a\r\ncelebrated German instrumentalist whom this ape must have seen perform on\r\nsome occasion or other; for this extravagant action was far too original\r\nto have been evolved from the brain of an ape. This music, although a\r\nlittle mad, was, as they say, very lively; so much so, indeed, that when\r\nthe performer resumed, coaïtas, mangabeys, ourang-outangs, talapoins,\r\ncapuchins, green monkeys, douroucoulis, magots, tee-tees, pig-tailed\r\nmacaques, siamangs, propitheces, baboons, vervets, sapajous, marmosets,\r\nmandrills, and alouattes commenced to dance with ardour—indeed, one\r\nmay say frenzy—to the sound of this piano. It was not a noble sight,\r\ncertainly; but pardon me the comparison, I fancied I saw in these apes,\r\ndressed up in their long swallow-tailed coats and with their bushy\r\nbeards, a striking resemblance to some of our European fops.\r\n\r\nDecidedly it was a ball—a ball given by apes, a ball such as, there was\r\nnow no longer any doubt, they themselves had often seen given by the\r\nadmiral of the station to his officers and their wives.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi, I know not why, had deserted the ball-room. As yet, however,\r\nthe dancers did not appear to have felt this august absence over-much.\r\nAh, how the creatures waltzed and polked! It was a perfect tempest—a\r\nwhirlwind, in fact. I was nearly knocked to pieces by them. In the\r\nmidst of my surprise I discovered something new which explained to me\r\nKarabouffi’s absence.\r\n\r\nThe _fête_ had scarcely lasted an hour, when, to my intense surprise, I\r\nwitnessed the arrival of fluttering groups of young and lively guenons,\r\nattended by cavaliers in straw-coloured gloves, who were all attired in\r\nsuperb robes of silk and muslin, and draped in magnificent shawls from\r\nLahore—displaying, in short, the most charming details of toilet that one\r\ncan well imagine. This ball was not to be without ladies any more than\r\nspring was to be without its flowers. But let us ponder a little over\r\nthese beauties and their costumes. The subject is always an interesting\r\none. Without doubt some of them had red noses and white chins; others,\r\ntoo, were what is styled scraggy about the neck and shoulders, of which\r\nthey made a greater display than was necessary by wearing extremely low\r\ndresses, while all of them shocked you with their hairy and bony arms.\r\nBut has the reader never observed at balls in Europe, delicate and select\r\nas they may be, red noses and white chins, angular shoulders and flat\r\nbreasts, and bony and even hairy arms?\r\n\r\nAt the point at which I have arrived in the recital of my troubles,\r\nthere is no need, I suppose, for me to explain how the lively and\r\nfoolish guenons had managed to procure their headdresses, gloves, shoes,\r\nshawls, and robes. Every one can guess that they had much the same title\r\nto them as their husbands and lovers had to the officers’ coats and\r\nstraw-coloured gloves—in other words, they had stolen them from the wives\r\nand daughters of the English officers.\r\n\r\nLet me now continue my description of the ball, and yield my meed of\r\npraise to an innovation worthy of introduction on the other side of the\r\nequator, and of being naturalised in Europe, either at Vienna, Madrid,\r\nLondon, or Paris. Many of these charming monkeys danced with pink,\r\ngreen, orange, or blue parasols, which they held open over the heads of\r\ntheir partners with a certain coquetry of attitude and movement that was\r\nperfectly irresistible. I shall never forget the parasol polka, which\r\nI still think worthy of European adoption. My only fear is that on its\r\nsubsequent introduction to New York, where, as we all know, every fashion\r\nis pushed to excess, they would go from parasols to umbrellas, which\r\nwould not look anything like so graceful.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this brilliant crowd that I suddenly caught sight\r\nof Karabouffi the First offering his arm to Saïmira—to the beautiful\r\nand interesting Saïmira—who was trembling all over with fear at being\r\nthus made an exhibition of in public. I pitied the poor chimpanzee, who\r\nhad evidently been torn apart from the loving Mococo by the detestable\r\nKarabouffi. Karabouffi regarded her as his own. But Saïmira was not one\r\nof those miserable creatures who, in order to wear a few pearls on their\r\nforeheads and a piece of velvet over their shoulders, sell their youth\r\nand beauty, their lips and heart, when they have already given their\r\nheart to another. And I could see that although she was present in all\r\nher youth and charms, her thoughts were wandering around the iron cage,\r\nthe prison bars of the unfortunate Mococo.\r\n\r\nAmong these swarms of she-monkeys I recognised several who had formerly\r\nbelonged to my menagerie at Macao. I recollected having taught them\r\nto march like grenadiers, to shake hands vigorously with me, to wear\r\npetticoats, so ample and round that one was often tempted to take them\r\nby the head and shake them like bells, for they looked so much like\r\nthem; to smoke cigarettes both of a morning and evening, the smoke of\r\nwhich they would emit through their noses as the Spanish smugglers are\r\nin the habit of doing; and to wear little pork-pie hats stuck on the\r\ntop of their heads. I had also taught them to dance, throwing their\r\nbodies forward and from side to side, to salute with rude familiarity,\r\nto use a fan artfully, and to represent among themselves scenes from\r\npantomimes. I had hardly done wrong in making them so different from\r\nothers of their species, since in comparison with these they were true\r\nactresses. When monkeys of this class are young, they generally have no\r\ntalent; when they come to possess talent, they no longer have any beauty.\r\nThus those whom I recognised at this _soirée_ were for the most part old\r\nand broken down; some were even toothless; still this did not prevent\r\ntheir being a thousand times more sought after, a thousand times more\r\nflattered, than their youthful companions, and this by the most handsome\r\nand seductive cavaliers. There was no kind of respectful attention,\r\ndelicate officiousness, or demonstrative weakness which they did not\r\nexhibit towards them. One unfastened his gold chain and put it over the\r\nwrinkled neck of one of these parchment-looking ladies; another threw his\r\nwhole soul into the look which he darted at the desolate breast of one of\r\nhis companions. What a pity! This elegant sapajou, young, agreeable, and\r\nwell made, who even passed for the son of Karabouffi’s prime minister,\r\nwas dying with love, the idiot! at the feet—at the big feet, too—of\r\nan insignificant-looking monkey with a pug nose, and as yellow and\r\nshrivelled as any Egyptian mummy. All this was absurd enough, still no\r\none will pretend to say that the same kind of ridiculous fooleries are\r\nnot constantly indulged in by people moving in the most refined society.\r\nI cannot, therefore, venture in this particular respect to exalt my own\r\nspecies high above these poor apes, deprived, as we know them to be, of\r\nthe light of reason. As it is quite certain that they will never read\r\nthese lines, I do not hesitate to give, in passing, this little lesson in\r\nmodesty to readers of my own species, to the end that our pride should\r\nnot accustom us always to consider ourselves superior in every respect to\r\nthe rest of Nature’s creatures.\r\n\r\nIf the reader is astonished at the repose which I was permitted to enjoy\r\nafter the perilous adventures through which I had passed, he would\r\nutterly misunderstand one peculiar characteristic of this fantastic\r\nrace into whose power my ill-luck had thrown me. It has the faculty of\r\nremembering or forgetting things with the swiftness of electricity.\r\nI have been too often witness of this strange reaction. At the very\r\nmoment that one of these animals rushes forward to attack you, he will\r\nfrequently stop short to scratch his ear or to walk with stealthy feet\r\nbehind an ant or a fly. At other times, when you believe him to be\r\nintently watching the movements of a fly, he will throw himself roughly\r\nupon you, and tear your face. Such is the ape.\r\n\r\nThis period of calm, at which I confess I was myself astonished, was\r\nbroken in the following manner:—I have said that there was a guitar\r\nand an accordion in the room where these animals were dancing. At a\r\nsign from Karabouffi they invited me to take part in a trio which was\r\nthus organised:—A guenon seated herself at the piano, a sapajou took\r\npossession of the accordion, and I was offered the guitar. As I hesitated\r\nto acknowledge this complaisance on their part in a becoming manner—pride\r\nwe all know is incorrigible—I received on the top of my head such a\r\nbrutal blow with the back of the instrument disdainfully refused by\r\nme, that for the moment I believed myself killed, and for three days\r\nafterwards I was tormented with an insupportable singing in the ears. Of\r\ncourse I required no further pressing. I knew immediately how to play the\r\nguitar, and proceeded to take part in the trio; and what a trio it was!\r\nNevertheless, on listening attentively, one discovered—at a great depth,\r\nit is true—the elements of primitive music among these creatures of\r\nOceania. If I had had sufficient self-possession to take down that air,\r\nit would have figured by this time at the concerts of the Conservatoire\r\nde Paris and of the London Philharmonic Society, as a specimen of lyrical\r\nand religious sentiment amongst a savage race at the moment they see the\r\nFather of Nature, the sun, begin to rise.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive from this incident how very necessary it was\r\nfor me to be quite certain of the precise dispositions of these furious\r\nfools, bent upon maltreating me; who pursued their persecutions in a\r\nspirit of diabolical calculation, and were bent upon imposing on me the\r\nhumiliating obligation of doing as a man all that I had formerly made\r\nthem do as apes. I had made them play the violin in public when they\r\nwere with me: they compelled me to strum the guitar now that I was their\r\nprisoner. I had forced them to dance on the tight-rope, and to climb to\r\nthe top of a pole: they brought a pole, and commanded me in the most\r\nimperious way, by signs which I could not fail to understand, to commence\r\nascending it.\r\n\r\nA cold sweat ran down my forehead, although the ball-room was frightfully\r\nhot, at the bare idea of the brutish part I was condemned to perform—to\r\namuse apes—I, one of the first citizens of Macao, the descendant of an\r\nhonourable Portuguese family, and who had been baptised in the church of\r\nSt. Philip the Elder! The pole was placed in the centre of the apartment,\r\nand to sustain it in a perpendicular position thirty quadrumana of three\r\ndifferent heights arranged themselves in a very ingenious manner, which I\r\nam about to explain.\r\n\r\nThe smallest, after all having seated themselves on the ground, held\r\nthe pole, fixed upright in their midst; those of intermediate height\r\ngrasped the pole with their hands a few inches above, keeping their feet\r\nfirmly planted on the ground about a yard off; the tallest, and these\r\nwere ourang-outangs and mandrills, threw their gigantic arms above the\r\narms of the others, and their legs, which were to serve as props, beyond\r\nthe legs of the lower ranks. It was, in fact, a kind of wheel, formed of\r\nsinewy legs and shoulders pressed one against another, and arms of steel,\r\nof which the axis was the pole, rising up before me, uncommonly like a\r\ngibbet.\r\n\r\nA glance which Karabouffi directed towards me enjoined me a second time\r\nto climb this pole. As I was balancing myself and preparing to swing\r\nover this living pedestal, in order to grasp it firmly within my arms, a\r\nmangabey, a giant nearly seven feet high, stiffened his long tail, and by\r\nway of incentive struck me with it two smart blows, one on the back and\r\nthe other on the legs. These had the desired effect, for, bursting with\r\nrage, I bounded forward and commenced climbing.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say with regard to my performance? In spite of my utmost\r\nefforts I could not raise myself even half-way up the pole. Unaccustomed\r\nas I might have been to this kind of exercise, I must nevertheless\r\nconfess that I failed most disgracefully. I tugged, I slipped, I tried\r\nanew, I slipped again; fresh efforts only caused a still further descent,\r\nand, what took the heart quite out of me, I was all the while subjected\r\nto undisguised expressions of disapprobation on the part of the audience.\r\nThey murmured here, they grunted there, they were hissing everywhere.\r\nWhat a revenge these wretches took! It was quite true that I had thrashed\r\nthem when they climbed awkwardly at Macao, and that I used to laugh at\r\nthem after having beaten them; still, after all, I was a man possessed\r\nof the double light of reason and faith, whilst they were unintelligent\r\nbeings. But did this give me the right of coercing, insulting, and\r\nthrashing them whenever I felt so disposed? My efforts to climb the pole\r\nhad resulted in certain bruises to my frame, and in tearing my trousers\r\nand coat-sleeves—already sufficiently tried in the various turns of\r\nfortune they had undergone—almost to tatters. How could I manage to\r\nrenew them in the destitute condition in which I was? For this moment,\r\nhowever, my skin demanded more of my solicitude than my clothes did, and,\r\nin truth, I only turned my attention to these when the incident of my\r\nclimbing efforts was pretty nigh forgotten.\r\n\r\nI never arrived at the upper half of the pole. Probably I should still be\r\noccupied with my hopeless task but for a lucky accident which put an end\r\nto my ridiculous punishment. Too weak apparently to support the weight\r\nof my body at the point to which I had managed to drag myself after\r\nunheard-of efforts, the confounded pole snapped asunder and I fell into\r\nthe arena, bruised with my fall and crushed by the mockeries with which\r\nI was overwhelmed. Here I lay stunned, motionless, and degraded, in the\r\nmidst of an unpitying and jeering crowd.\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered myself, had it not been for the encouraging look which\r\nSaïmira—who I could see was occupied with the project of rescuing me from\r\nmy present frightful position—I should have been tempted to have blown\r\nout my brains with my pistols and so made an end of it. But Saïmira was\r\nthe cause of my resisting the temptation.\r\n\r\nEre, however, she found the means of saving me, I was called upon to\r\nperform a new interlude at this brilliant _soirée_.\r\n\r\nI was aroused from the reverie into which I had fallen by a blow like\r\nthat which had compelled me, in spite of myself, to make an attempt to\r\nclimb the pole. Only the stiff and sinewy tail of the mandrill struck\r\nme this time somewhat more tenderly. He only wished to arouse me, I\r\nfancy. On looking up I saw before me one of my new masters—I had now\r\nbecome their creature as completely as they had formerly been creatures\r\nof mine—comically scratching his thigh, describing in the air joyous\r\ncapers, thrusting out his tongue at me in a mocking way, whirling about\r\non his head with his legs spread out like a fork—going through, in fact,\r\na thousand grimaces and contortions such as I had taught my apes to\r\npractise at Macao. After some minutes of this performance, which appeared\r\nto be rather for my benefit than for that of the other spectators, he\r\nsuddenly stopped, looked at me with signs of impatience, and waited. But\r\nwhat could he possibly expect from me? A second blow from that vital cord\r\nwhich formed the termination of the mandrill’s back warned me that what\r\nwas expected from me was nothing less than a public exhibition of my\r\ntumbling accomplishments similar to those which he had deigned to display\r\nbefore me. What proved to me that I was not mistaken in my idea was, that\r\nhaving attempted at all hazards a timid somersault, the mandrill’s tail\r\nrose and fell without striking me. I had, then, perfectly comprehended\r\nhim, and all that now remained for me to do was to perform before the\r\ncompany: I had merely to copy the grimaces and contortions which I had\r\njust witnessed, that was all. Alas! what misery the vanquished are called\r\nupon to endure! Could human degradation sink below this? To be obliged to\r\nimitate an ape! The colour rose to my face. I commenced my performance;\r\nbut who can tell what I endured? Every time that my manly dignity checked\r\nme in the midst of a somersault, at that very same instant the sinewy\r\ntail of the mandrill caught me a blow in the face. Courage, Polydorus!\r\ncourage! Indeed I had need of all I possessed. I jumped through hoops,\r\ndanced the Pyrrhic dance, and imitated the movements of a dancing bear;\r\nsaluted the gentlemen, and blew kisses to the ladies; finally, I went\r\nround, hat in hand, and asked, according to custom, some money from the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nI was almost dead from fatigue and moral prostration when an uproar\r\nlouder than any I had previously heard burst forth in the saloon. In a\r\nminute the apartment was half emptied: the apes that remained watching\r\nme soon followed the example of their fellows. What could possibly have\r\nhappened? Karabouffi, whom I recognised in the obscurity of the verandah\r\ncourtyard, appeared to be at the head of this great movement.\r\n\r\nIt was to the excellent Saïmira that I owed this diversion, and to whom\r\nI was, moreover, indebted to my not dying of suffering and shame during\r\nthat terrible night.\r\n\r\nThis is how she managed to deliver me from my tormentors. By an affected\r\ncoquetry she aroused Karabouffi’s jealousy so thoroughly, that,\r\nexasperated and furious, he dragged her from the saloon, when, as a\r\nmatter of course, he was accompanied in his exit by his entire court.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I was left alone.\r\n\r\nThis unhoped-for respite inspired me with a project which I proceeded to\r\nput in execution with the promptitude of despair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    I barricade myself in.—I am besieged.—The verandah becomes a\r\n    fort.—What I discover at the end of a forgotten room.—Lord\r\n    Campbell’s journal.—What this journal says.—The Malay pirates\r\n    and the Sultan of Sooloo.—Three hundred junks.—A formidable\r\n    hunt.—Death of a mysterious and colossal mandrill.—Explanation\r\n    of the white skeleton.—Torture of a man compelled to drink\r\n    nothing but excellent old wine.—A poignard stuck in the\r\n    sand.—The last _fête_ at the station.—How it terminates.—End of\r\n    an unfinished journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that the destruction, which was in other respects\r\ngeneral, had not extended to the range of apartments which opened to the\r\ncool air of the verandah, and the vast kitchens where I had discovered\r\nsuch a large stock of provisions. As soon as I found myself alone I\r\nhastened to shut the three doors of the arcades of the reception-room,\r\nand I moreover barricaded them securely. This was a good thing done.\r\nIn less than ten minutes after the miraculous departure of these cruel\r\nwretches I was securely fortified against all their attacks. Firearms,\r\nand perhaps cannon even, were necessary to dislodge me. And I had plenty\r\nof provisions!\r\n\r\nI passed the rest of the night as tranquilly as I was accustomed to do\r\nin my house at Macao—so tranquilly, in fact, that I believe I must have\r\nslept several days.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this indeterminable time, during which I was absorbed,\r\nas it were, by a sleep of lead, my first thought on awaking in a calmer\r\nframe of mind than I had known for some time past was to make myself\r\nperfectly conversant with my situation. I had no difficulty in coming to\r\nthe conclusion that so long as I was destined to remain on this island I\r\nshould be exposed to a perpetual vengeance worse than death at the hands\r\nof my tormentors. At present I believed myself to be perfectly secure,\r\nbut if I dared to venture forth I should, of course, become the object of\r\nrenewed attacks.\r\n\r\nOccupied with these thoughts, I proceeded to examine the retreat in which\r\nI had intrenched myself, to see whether I had left any point of attack\r\naccessible to my crafty foes. First of all I assured myself that the\r\nthree doors of the saloon and the door of the kitchen would resist their\r\nunited malice. They were of heart of oak and teak, the hardest of all\r\nwoods; and the locks, admirable examples of English manufacture, added\r\nmuch to the security of my defence. The lower portion of the fortress\r\nmight, therefore, be considered impregnable.\r\n\r\nBut these doors once closed, light penetrated to the ground-floor only\r\nby a little Moorish bell-tower belonging to the upper story. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, for me, as I dared not open the doors, to pass my\r\ndays in the second story; at night I could descend, if I pleased, to the\r\nlower rooms.\r\n\r\nNot having the slightest idea of the arrangement of this upper story, I\r\nproceeded there at once; a spiral staircase, constructed in the thickness\r\nof the wall, led to it. Once arrived there, I could see that the\r\napartments composing it had been kept in remarkable order by the former\r\noccupiers. One was unquestionably Vice-Admiral Campbell’s study. The\r\nwalls were hidden behind a row of boxes which assuredly contained papers\r\nof great importance. I thought as much simply because I had no knowledge\r\nwhatever of the matter.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding any farther in my researches I approached the windows\r\nof the bell-tower, which were filled with transparent horn from China,\r\nthrough which one can see without being seen. I at once directed my eyes\r\nto the courtyard of the verandah. The reader will understand this was\r\noverlooked by the Moorish belfry, from which I moreover had a view of\r\nthe woods and garden plots outside the courtyard. But what did I see on\r\nglancing around? Why, my indefatigable enemies all posted on guard from\r\none point to another, on all the heights, on the branches of the trees,\r\non every knoll of ground, watching to see whether I would venture to\r\nleave my retreat, or even if I would show myself at some opening where,\r\non signalling me, they could commence their attack in a regular manner.\r\n\r\nAll were armed with bamboos and sticks of an enormous size. It was a\r\nsilent siege of an enemy, invisible behind his lines of defence. To climb\r\nup to that story, the loftiness of which defied their malice, was to them\r\na real impossibility, and it was none the less an impossibility for them\r\nto burst open the barricaded doors, which were placed between their rage\r\nand me.\r\n\r\nThus reassured on all sides, I proceeded to resume my investigations of\r\nthe Vice-Admiral Campbell’s apartments.\r\n\r\nI was delighted to find in the remotest room—that in which I commenced\r\nmy inspection—a small collection of books on travels, consisting of the\r\nmost esteemed works on Japan, Tartary, China, New Guinea, New South\r\nWales, and the islands of Oceania, from Marco Polo to Dumont d’Urville.\r\nMost of these useful works had the admiral’s crest and initials on the\r\ncorner. I felt certain that they had been removed from the library of\r\nthe frigate Halcyon, and had evidently been placed temporarily in this\r\nroom that the officers might have recourse to them during their sojourn\r\non land. It is scarcely possible to imagine what an inestimable treasure\r\nthese books were to me. I was seized with a most impatient desire to\r\nconsult these works. Perhaps by reading them and consulting the valuable\r\nmaps which they contained I might learn on what island I had been thrown\r\nby my shipwreck. I had already placed my hand on the travels of the\r\ncelebrated Spanish navigator who gave his glorious name to the group of\r\nislands called Mindanao, which are mostly peopled by Malay pirates, even\r\nto the present day, when my attention was diverted by a volume lying on\r\nthe study table. I opened it and found it was a manuscript. A sense of\r\ndiscretion warned me to close it, but having read in large letters on\r\nthe first page, “Personal and private journal of Vice-Admiral Campbell,\r\ncommanding the English forces in Oceania,” I opened it anew with an\r\nirresistible curiosity, and I may add with a very good reason, since I\r\nforesaw all the information I was going to derive from it.\r\n\r\n“Having left Macao towards the end of the month of July, 1849,” observed\r\nthe admiral in the opening lines of his journal, “I established my\r\nstation during the following six months—that is to say, till the month\r\nof January, 1850—at times among the Luzon islands and at others among\r\nthe group of Philippines, taking care, however, not to neglect some\r\nprecautionary visits to the archipelago of Sooloo, that seemingly\r\nimperishable nest of pirates.\r\n\r\n“The purely nautical events which have taken place during these six\r\nmonths of my cruise among the different islets having been noted day by\r\nday and nearly hour by hour in the ship’s log-book, I propose to insert\r\nin this private journal a few notes which it is my intention to transmit\r\nto the Admiralty on the first opportunity that offers.\r\n\r\n“The notes to which I refer are as follows,” was the next line in the\r\njournal which I had under my eyes.\r\n\r\nMy attention increased—I continued to read without missing a single\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“It is demonstrated to me as clear as a geometrical theorem that at\r\nthis moment the naval forces of England, Holland, and Spain assembled\r\nin Oceania are insufficient, each for a different reason, to resist the\r\never-increasing audacity of the pirates spread over the seas of this\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\n“The Spanish forces are a derision, and they would really be exterminated\r\nin a few months by the pirates but for the assistance which they never\r\ncease to ask from those of England.\r\n\r\n“The naval forces of Holland, which are in truth much more considerable,\r\nscarcely ever leave the shores of Sumatra, Java, and some points of\r\nBorneo, under the pretext, plausible enough but not on that account the\r\nless selfish, that their duty above all things is to watch the safety of\r\ntheir own colonies.\r\n\r\n“There remain our English naval forces.\r\n\r\n“As we also are under the necessity of displaying great vigilance with\r\nrespect to our own colonies, and as we have, moreover, as I have already\r\nmentioned, to render constant assistance to the secondary maritime\r\npowers, such as Holland, Spain, and Portugal, it becomes more and\r\nmore evident that we contend but indifferently at present against the\r\ndepredations, pillagings, and descents, incendiary fires and barbarous\r\nmurders, of which the incorrigible Malay pirates are constantly guilty.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, the power of these unconquerable corsairs increasing\r\nfrom year to year, their flotillas have become fleets; their barques,\r\nprahs, and junks are now almost frigates; their sailors have never ceased\r\nto be the most energetic on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n“In view of this state of things I conceive it is of the\r\nutmost importance that the number of our war-vessels in these\r\nunceasingly-threatened seas should be largely increased, or we shall very\r\nshortly be placed in a position of serious peril.\r\n\r\n“It is my duty to warn the Admiralty of all these things, which concern\r\nin the highest degree the security of the various fine colonies which\r\nEngland possesses in Australia and Oceania in general.\r\n\r\n“Whilst awaiting the reinforcements which the Admiralty will, without\r\ndoubt, consider it necessary to send me, I have thought the best\r\ncourse for me to follow was to establish myself in the very centre of\r\nthe Malayan piracy, in order to watch its progress and to study its\r\nresources, that I may be enabled to annihilate it by some sure blow when\r\nI should have at my command the means of action, which are at present\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n“I have chosen for my post of observation an island situated among\r\nthe hundred and fifty or two hundred isles of which the well-known\r\narchipelago of Sooloo is composed.”\r\n\r\nSooloo! Surprise and fright made me stop. Sooloo, the nest of sea-sharks,\r\nbirds of prey hovering unceasingly over the vessels of all nations! I was\r\non an island of the archipelago of Sooloo!\r\n\r\nIt took me nearly a quarter of an hour to recover from the agitation into\r\nwhich this discovery had thrown me.\r\n\r\nAnd it was under the influence of the henceforth unconquerable idea that\r\nI was living in the very midst of this nest of savage bandits that I\r\nrecommenced the reading of the journal.\r\n\r\n“Having referred above,” continued Vice-Admiral Campbell, “to my log-book\r\nfor the purely nautical circumstances of the first six months of my\r\ncruise, I intend to confine myself to such incidents as may arise from\r\nthe present time up to the day of my leaving this island, where I have\r\nnow been nearly a fortnight. It is now the 15th of January, 1850.\r\n\r\n“After having brought the Halcyon to an anchorage, so well sheltered by\r\nthe woody shores of the island that it is impossible to perceive the\r\nfrigate a hundred fathoms from the beach, and having given it in charge\r\nto a sufficient number of sailors commanded by one of my best officers, I\r\nlanded on the island with the larger portion of the crew and immediately\r\ntook possession of it.\r\n\r\n“This island is called by the small number of aborigines that I found\r\nupon it _Kouparou_, which signifies in the Malay tongue the island of\r\n_sleeping fire_ or of the dead volcano.\r\n\r\n“These aborigines are Tagals, the most ancient inhabitants of Malaya,\r\nbut they have been driven from every part by the Malays. They are a mild\r\nrace, devoted to Europeans, and possessing some of the instincts of our\r\nadvanced civilisation.\r\n\r\n“By means of these Tagals, who have the same customs as the Malays,\r\nalthough they do not like one another in the least, and whom I think of\r\nsending as spies into all the islands of the archipelago of Sooloo, I\r\nshould become acquainted with all that was being done and meditated in\r\nthese arsenals of piracy.\r\n\r\n“From six months of such study on the spot more would be learnt than\r\ncould possibly be acquired during any number of years engaged in sailing\r\nin and out the islands of the archipelago.\r\n\r\n“I gave orders to have all the portable houses which I had had\r\nconstructed at Calcutta unshipped and placed in position.\r\n\r\n“Ten or fifteen days were occupied in this work, at the expiration of\r\nwhich time we installed ourselves in the houses, which for all the world\r\nresembled a village of Sumatra.\r\n\r\n“The aborigines seemed very pleased at our arrival, and I have considered\r\nthe moment a favourable one for the execution of my project. I therefore\r\nchose from the Tagals those on whom I thought I could most rely, and sent\r\nthem in their fishing-boats to the neighbouring isles, in order that on\r\ntheir return they might furnish me with conscientious reports concerning\r\nthe prospects and projects of piracy.\r\n\r\n“This expedition, which required twenty days’ preparation, set sail\r\non the 21st of February. The aborigines whom I have retained are\r\nindispensable for the cultivation of the island. From them we look to\r\nlearn all about its topography and natural resources.\r\n\r\n“The soil of Kouparou is evidently very fertile; flowers and fruit are\r\nseen in abundance, and the covers positively swarm with game! Save for\r\nthe apes, with which the island swarms, Kouparou would be a garden in the\r\nmidst of the ocean. But those apes utterly destroy the charm of the spot.\r\nThey increase, too, like flies.”\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” I exclaimed to myself, “why the vice-admiral has also been in\r\ncontact with these terrible animals. But how did this happen? If he has\r\nbeen assailed, beaten, and almost murdered like I have been, what, in\r\ngoodness’ name, did he do?” But let us continue.\r\n\r\n“My Tagals returned after a month’s absence, and the information which\r\nthey brought back with them concerning the contemplated proceedings of\r\nthe pirates was of the highest importance, and likely to be of very great\r\nservice to me. All their reports, without exception, announce that a\r\nvast expedition of Malay pirates is preparing in the isle of Brassilan,\r\nthe capital of the archipelago of Sooloo, and where the Sultan of Sooloo\r\nhimself resided.\r\n\r\n“The pirates proposed to leave this port, and the ports of Besvan,\r\nTaouitaoui, and Palawan, with a fleet of at least three hundred junks,\r\nto cross the straits of Mindanao and Celebes, in order to seize all the\r\nEnglish, Dutch, Spanish, or Portuguese merchant ships proceeding to\r\nChina during the year. The time of their departure is kept so secret\r\nthat none of my faithful Tagals have been able to discover it for me.\r\nBut from the knowledge which I possess of the particular winds which are\r\nrequired to allow of their leaving the archipelago of Sooloo to proceed\r\nin the course they have planned to the sea-coast of Asia, I think that my\r\npirates will not set sail until the end of June—that is to say, in three\r\nmonths from the present time. At this period the Halcyon will leave her\r\nhidden anchorage, and joining with the other vessels on the station, will\r\nproceed in search of the pirate fleet which if we are fortunate enough\r\nto encounter we will lose no time in measuring our strength with these\r\nmyriads of bold and unscrupulous robbers. The struggle will be a warm\r\none; but I am aware that I can only count on my own forces. At the period\r\nto which I refer the reinforcements which I have asked from England will,\r\nin all probability, not have arrived. In this case we must try alone!\r\nGod, I know, will be with us, and we shall do very well with His aid.\r\n\r\n“In the meanwhile my Tagals are about to return to Sooloo, Besvan, and\r\nthe other points of rendezvous, so as to keep me well informed with\r\nreference to the forthcoming great event.\r\n\r\n“But here we are installed in Kouparou. My officers and their families\r\nare enjoying the best of health in the wooden houses surrounded with\r\npalm-trees. My verandah would compare for elegance with those of Madras\r\nand Cananor.\r\n\r\n“We want for nothing, and our amusements are numerous. The weather is\r\ndelicious; I have never seen a finer April, even in Australia.\r\n\r\n“I am about to set out on a swan-hunt; but I am very much afraid of only\r\nbringing back apes instead of swans, as I did on the last occasion. They\r\nare everywhere! They are so numerous, in fact, that I am almost certain\r\nin firing off a gun at hazard, above my head, to bring down an ape.\r\n\r\n“I have never seen them so savage before; those which I brought with me\r\nfrom Macao are perfectly civilised beings compared with the apes which we\r\nencounter here.”\r\n\r\n“Worthy admiral!” I exclaimed, “he remembers the purchases which he made\r\nof me at Macao. What a remembrance! Macao! Macao! Shall I ever see you\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\nLet us continue his interesting journal.\r\n\r\n“I have returned from the chase, bringing back with me my baboon\r\nKarabouffi. Wishing to amuse this big stupid ape, who is dying of\r\nennui, although he has numbers of his compatriots around him, I let\r\nhim accompany me on my expedition. A foolish melancholy seems to have\r\ntaken possession of him, because the beautiful chimpanzee Saïmira, who\r\nis passionately attached to her lover Mococo, refuses to receive his\r\nattentions.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said I to myself—“alas! if the vice-admiral could only see Mococo\r\nnow!”\r\n\r\n“I may here note,” continues Admiral Campbell, “that there occurred\r\nduring this chase an extraordinary incident which is deserving of a place\r\nin my journal.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of a large wood of pandanus and mimosas, into which I had\r\nwandered with Karabouffi, I suddenly saw advancing towards me, stick in\r\nhand, which he carried like a sceptre, a gigantic mandrill, black as\r\na Kaffir, and followed by a troop of apes, among which were numerous\r\nvervets, who seemed to form a kind of court for him, they were so\r\nrespectful in their bearing towards him.\r\n\r\n“Karabouffi, generally so proud and fearless, trembled with terror on\r\nbeholding this gigantic mandrill. He had recognised in him a master, and\r\nconsequently an enemy. He positively shuddered, then he came close up\r\nto me, as if to solicit my protection, all the time, however, showing\r\nin his eyes, which were lit up with rage, the pleasure he would feel\r\nin tearing him to pieces. As I was on the point of taking aim at the\r\ncolossal mandrill he rushed upon Karabouffi, and the struggle which\r\nraged between the two animals was certainly a superb one. It was evident\r\nfrom the courage and ferocity which they both exhibited that they were\r\nthe representatives of two profoundly antipathetic races. Karabouffi\r\nwas visibly getting the worst of the encounter, for the mandrill was\r\nstrong enough to tackle three baboons such as he. So at the risk of\r\nbeing slaughtered if I missed my mark, I profited by the moment when the\r\nmandrill retired a few paces to take a spring, and sent a bullet through\r\nhis head. He fell, uttering the most frightful groans, which had in them\r\nsomething of a man’s plaintive cry. Karabouffi was triumphant. I believed\r\nthat he would have strangled me in his excess of joy. As to the apes\r\nthat accompanied the black mandrill, they immediately dispersed, which\r\nwould not have been the case had they been of a more powerful species.\r\nI should assuredly have had to defend myself against their vindictive\r\nattacks, but the greater part of them were vervets, the most gentle and\r\ninoffensive of the quadrumanous family. Nevertheless, at the moment of\r\ntheir flight, they cast at Karabouffi looks which made him quiver. It\r\nwould have been hard times for him if he had fallen under their claws.\r\nI shall have this monster mandrill skinned, and shall dry his skin and\r\nbones in the sun, and offer them to the British Museum.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said I to myself, “this is the explanation of the skeleton\r\nwhich I found hanging to a tree during the first days of my sojourn\r\nin this island. It must have been that of the mandrill killed by\r\nAdmiral Campbell.” My only regret—and it may well be believed this was\r\nsincere—was that he had not killed Karabouffi number one in preference to\r\nthe mandrill.\r\n\r\n“From what I have heard of the habits of these particular animals,\r\ncoupled with my own observations of them,” continued the admiral in his\r\njournal, “I am of the opinion that the mandrill killed by me exercised\r\nauthority over this island before the Tagals, who do not seem to have\r\noccupied it long, arrived here.\r\n\r\n“On my return from this expedition, in accordance with my usual habit, I\r\nplaced my gun in the armoury.”\r\n\r\nHis gun in the armoury! I rose precipitately from my seat on seeing this,\r\nand ran and opened several cupboards. At last I hit upon the right one,\r\nwhich I found contained not only some fine fowling-pieces, but also a\r\nlarge quantity of powder, and bullets of all sizes. Let my persecutors\r\ncome now! I am ready for them; I have something to receive them with,\r\nthought I. In my transport I rushed to the window, so as to defy them\r\nface to face. They were still in the same places and in the same\r\nattitudes of hostility. Only they were far more numerous.\r\n\r\nI did not proceed any further with the reading of the journal that day. I\r\nhad ample materials for reflection; moreover, I still felt fatigued with\r\nthe exertions of the preceding evening. After having promised myself to\r\nresume my perusal of the journal the first thing the next day, I resolved\r\nto go and have my dinner.\r\n\r\nMy second repast off the preserved meats of the station was one of the\r\nbest I have ever partaken of. While choosing the things most agreeable\r\nto my taste, I had ample opportunity of noting the extent and variety of\r\nmy stores, and saw that I had plenty to depend on whatever time I might\r\nbe forced to live in the state of imprisonment in which circumstances\r\nhad placed me. Hampers upon hampers of wine offered me a choice of the\r\nbest vintages of Spain, Portugal, and the south of France. Vice-Admiral\r\nCampbell was evidently a connoisseur in wine. Perhaps the wines which\r\nhe was in the habit of drinking were somewhat too alcoholic; still the\r\nEnglish, as we all know, are fond of strong wines. I tasted several\r\nbottles, too many bottles in fact, since finding my throat parched by\r\nthe fiery heat of these generous wines, I longed for a draught of water,\r\nbut could discover none. They would surely have sunk a well, thought I,\r\nin the large apartment of which I have already spoken, for the admiral’s\r\nuse; but I was mistaken—the admiral does not seem to have cared for so\r\ninsipid a beverage.\r\n\r\nI had no alternative, therefore, but to continue to drink, during my\r\ndinner, a fluid which was somewhat too heating. My sleep, although my\r\ntongue was rather dry, was sound and refreshing. No saddening dream\r\ndisturbed my rest, and at some early hour in the morning, precisely as I\r\nhad arranged in the projects of the preceding day, I found myself awake.\r\nI immediately mounted the narrow staircase leading to the admiral’s\r\nstudy. The staircase, I ought to have mentioned, was hidden in the\r\nwall, and so well hidden, indeed, that it was solely owing to this\r\nthe barbarous devastators of the other houses of the station had not\r\npillaged and ransacked this room.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down to continue my perusal of the journal I betook\r\nmyself to the bell-tower to see what was going on around the place. The\r\nexamination was anything but a very reassuring one. Various changes had\r\ntaken place, and these were among them. Every member of the besieging\r\nforce had, in addition to his stick, a little heap of stones beside\r\nhim, which he had piled up with as much care as is bestowed on the\r\ncannon-balls in our arsenals. What did they intend to do with these\r\nmissiles? Stones are very rare things in an island where sand abounds.\r\nIt is, indeed, a positive event to meet with a stone, except on the\r\nsea-shore, or on the banks of some lake, such as had furnished me with\r\na handful when I was endeavouring to knock down some fruit. Time would,\r\nno doubt, teach me how my enemies proposed to apply these new engines\r\nof war; at present the affair was an enigma—an enigma, moreover, of bad\r\naugury.\r\n\r\nAt length I seated myself, and opening Admiral Campbell’s journal, read\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\n“My Tagals departed anew ten days ago; I have desired them to endeavour\r\nto ascertain more exactly than they have yet been able to do the precise\r\ndate of the departure of the Malay fleet for the north of Asia, and\r\nto discover, so far as they can, the part which the Sultan of Sooloo,\r\nhimself our doubtful ally, takes in this expedition—whether he encourages\r\nit, tolerates it, or is not powerful enough to prevent it.\r\n\r\n“While awaiting the return of my Tagals, I occupied myself with studying\r\nthe geology of Kouparou. The island is evidently of recent formation. The\r\nextinct volcano is still working at a moderate depth, since streams of\r\nwater of a high degree of temperature are constantly upheaving the bed of\r\nlava which surrounds its base.\r\n\r\n“If I succeed in prevailing on the Admiralty to make a permanent station\r\nof Kouparou I shall ask, before all things, that the island may be\r\npurged of the intolerable herd of apes, with which it is now infested,\r\nby a regular hunt of several months’ duration; in the same way as our\r\nancestors formerly got rid of wolves in England.”\r\n\r\n“What an admirable project!” I exclaimed, “and if Admiral Campbell had\r\nonly had time to put it into execution, I should not be where I am.”\r\n\r\n“Here we are at the end of May,” pursued the journal, several dates of\r\nwhich I pass over as of no importance to my story; “nearly two months\r\nhave elapsed since the second departure of my devoted Tagals, and I have\r\nhad no news from them. They do not like, I suppose, to return to Kouparou\r\nwithout bringing with them certain information of the time fixed for the\r\ndeparture of the pirate fleet.\r\n\r\n“I can only ascribe to a more than ordinarily lively imagination,”\r\nobserved the vice-admiral, further on, “the remark made this morning\r\nby Mr. Dawson, my secretary, to the effect that he thought he saw\r\nlast night some scattered fires burning on the sea-shore, such as are\r\ngenerally kindled by the fishermen and pirates of these coasts. After\r\nall, although Kouparou is very difficult to approach, and of course still\r\nmore difficult to effect a landing upon, in the midst of the reefs which\r\nform a belt round it to a distance of eight leagues, it is not by any\r\nmeans impossible that fishermen, castaways, or even pirates, may have\r\nlighted some fires such as Mr. Dawson believed he saw. Should they have\r\ndone so, they will most likely depart on the morrow, believing the island\r\nto be uninhabited, like the greater number of those which form the vast\r\narchipelago of Sooloo. All I have to say is, ‘Joy go with them.’\r\n\r\n“To-day, Mr. Dawson, after having gone over to that part of the beach\r\nwhere he thought he saw the smoke ascending last evening, has been to\r\ntell me that he must have been deceived. He saw no footprints in the\r\nsand, nor any remains of burnt wood anywhere near the shore. He admits it\r\nmust have been an illusion on his part; I felt sure of it.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, the first of June, I have arranged to give a grand _fête_\r\nhere, in my cool verandah, to the officers of the Halcyon and their\r\nfamilies. It will be an agreeable relief to the monotonous sort of lives\r\nwe have been leading during the past two months.\r\n\r\n“I have this moment had brought to me a long poignard, found by one of\r\nour sailors, plunged in the sand on the shore opposite that which Mr.\r\nDawson examined this morning. What can it possibly portend?\r\n\r\n“A saw-poignard, and with teeth of the Malay form; in other words, a\r\n_crees_, since this is the name which the brigands of Oceania give to\r\nthis murderous and nearly always poisonous weapon. Dawson, who is as\r\nsuperstitious as an Irishman can be, indulged in a variety of comments.\r\nThe sailor who found the _crees_ could give us no additional information\r\nrespecting it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes”—I asked in my turn of the journal which I had beneath my\r\nquestioning gaze—“yes, what did this poignard portend? Whence did it\r\ncome? Why had it been stuck by its point in the sand?”\r\n\r\nAdmiral Campbell did not say another word respecting it, but passed from\r\nit to his _fête_, which was evidently the thing uppermost in his mind at\r\nthis moment.\r\n\r\n“As the weather is magnificently fine,” he went on to say, “I have\r\narranged for us to dine in the verandah court, and we shall in this case\r\nremain at table till the time arrives for opening the ball; we shall then\r\nproceed to the great gallery, where dancing will commence. I certainly\r\nowe to my brave officers and their families such amusements as I am able\r\nto furnish them with, to repay them for the fatigues and annoyances they\r\nhave experienced during the six months which have elapsed since we left\r\nMacao, although latterly our discomforts have certainly been fewer than\r\nusual. I trust that everything will go off satisfactorily, and that these\r\ngentlemen and their excellent helpmates will have cause to thank me\r\nto-morrow for the agreeable entertainment I have provided for them.\r\n\r\n“But for the inquietude, becoming every day more serious, which the\r\nprolonged absence of my good Tagals causes me, I should be perfectly\r\nhappy in this altogether unknown and nearly desert island. Can some\r\nmisfortune have overtaken them? What if these Malays have suspected the\r\nmotive of their visit? But no; my faithful envoys, a little slow, as all\r\nprimitive people are, will arrive to-morrow, perhaps this evening.”\r\n\r\nThe page containing the foregoing was complete. I eagerly turned over a\r\nnew leaf to commence the following one, but there was not another line\r\nto be seen, not a trace of writing on the page. The admiral’s journal,\r\nwhich I hoped would extend to another fifty pages at least, suddenly\r\nended there. Eh! not a word respecting the _fête_! Not a word more on\r\nthe poignard stuck by its point in the sand! Not a word about the return\r\nof the Tagals! Good Heaven, what sudden misfortune could have crushed\r\nthe pen and the noble hand which held it? But what about the Malay\r\npirates and their fleet? And what about the Halcyon? Nothing! absolutely\r\nnothing! A sinister blank followed the last line penned by the worthy\r\nvice-admiral. What had happened to the colony of Kouparou, and to the\r\nadmiral himself, since this last entry in his journal? There was no one\r\nto answer me. When there was not silence there was desolation, houses\r\npartially destroyed, and their contents turned topsy-turvy; savage\r\nand vindictive animals wearing, as though with the raillery of a low\r\nvengeance, the habiliments of the gallant officers of a noble vessel\r\nbelonging to the most powerful nation in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    A hundred bottles of champagne not worth a glass of water.—My\r\n    clothes leave me.—I commence the combat.—Great fight of a man\r\n    against an island full of apes.—The verandah about to fall.—It\r\n    does not last any longer.—A skin saves me.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the day my haggard eyes, reflecting my troubled\r\nmind, hovered over the last lines of this journal, which I pictured\r\nto myself as terminating in a description of a _fête_ and a general\r\nmassacre. But who could have committed this massacre? Hardly the Malays,\r\nfor they stay to plunder, and there had evidently been no pillage of the\r\nstation. The only other supposition which flashed across my mind seemed a\r\ngreat deal too absurd to be seriously entertained—no, I could not believe\r\nthat a conspiracy of apes, although my life depended upon them at the\r\npresent moment, could have been guilty of so atrocious a crime.\r\n\r\nNight came, and it was positively hideous to me with nightmares,\r\nhallucinations, and sudden shocks of alarm, which awoke me out of\r\nmy sleep. By daylight, when I became a little less agitated, I said\r\nto myself that if all the people belonging to the station had been\r\nassassinated in some mysterious way, I should at least have come across\r\ntheir remains, since, according to my calculations, it was now July, and\r\nthe journal finished in June, so that a month had elapsed since this\r\noutrage was committed.\r\n\r\nThis very reasonable idea having entered my head, I considered over the\r\nfacts mentioned in Lord Campbell’s journal, and arrived step by step at\r\nthe following conclusions:—\r\n\r\nThe Tagal spies must have let their secret escape or allowed it to be\r\nguessed on the occasion of their first voyage to Sooloo.\r\n\r\nThe Malay pirates, finding their plans discovered, would not allow the\r\nTagals to return to Kouparou after their second voyage. They would have\r\nflayed Admiral Campbell’s unfortunate spies alive, or would perhaps have\r\neaten them, since the Malays are somewhat inclined to cannibalism.\r\n\r\nAfter having eaten the Tagals, the Malays, whose vengeance never halts\r\nby the way, would have made a first descent by night on the island of\r\nKouparou, which would explain the distant fires seen by Mr. Dawson, Lord\r\nCampbell’s secretary.\r\n\r\nThe poignard stuck in the sand was the symbolical menace addressed by the\r\npirates to the sailors of the station, advising them, by this figurative\r\nbut most expressive warning, that they would return and either poignard\r\nthem or make themselves masters of them in some way or other.\r\n\r\nThey had actually returned, and the moment of their descent must have\r\nbeen at the time the _fête_ given to the officers of the Halcyon by\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell was taking place.\r\n\r\nThe pirates had, in all probability, succeeded in capturing all the\r\nofficers and sailors whom they found on the island itself; they would\r\nnext have attacked the Halcyon, when resistance would have been for the\r\nmost part impossible, as nearly all the crew would have been on shore.\r\nThey would then have taken the ship with all their prisoners to Sooloo,\r\nor to some other port of the archipelago known by this name.\r\n\r\nThe descent, the surprise, and the carrying of the prisoners off had\r\noccurred in the midst of the banquet which was to have preceded the\r\nball, and from this in all probability arose the disorder and confusion\r\nremarked by me in the courtyard of the verandah on the day I first\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\nThe pirates and their prisoners departed, the apes, those millions of\r\napes, of whom Admiral Campbell complained so bitterly in his journal,\r\nwould have taken possession of the officers’ apartments, and profiting\r\nby the spoils left so unaccountably by the pirates, would have proceeded\r\nto dress themselves in the uniforms which the unfortunate officers and\r\nsailors of the Halcyon had not time or opportunity to take with them.\r\n\r\nLastly, not allowing the logical thread which I held as it were between\r\nmy fingers to break for a single instant, I proceeded from all these\r\nincontestable inferences to this certain conclusion—namely, that in\r\nthe island of Kouparou apes of a certain superior species had formerly\r\npossessed the sovereignty; that these apes had been dispossessed by the\r\nTagals; that the Tagals had been sent to the right about by the English;\r\nthat the English had been expelled by the Malay pirates; that the Malay\r\npirates in their turn had just been dispossessed of it, if not by force,\r\nat least in fact, by the apes, to whom had returned again the sovereign\r\nauthority over the island of Kouparou—a lot, indeed, which has befallen\r\nmost of the islands of Oceania, many of which still attest by their ruins\r\nthat they were formerly inhabited by people intelligent enough to cover\r\nthese islands with handsome buildings, and who had afterwards to make\r\nroom for a population of apes. Frightful revolution!\r\n\r\nPlunged in the most gloomy reflections, after having thus pictured to\r\nmyself the misfortunes which had happened to the English station of\r\nKouparou, I quitted Admiral Campbell’s study, and descended to the\r\nlower apartments, resolved henceforth not to think seriously of a\r\ndeliverance which I now felt to be impossible. “I shall live on in this\r\ntomb,” said I to myself, “so long as it pleases God to preserve me.” To\r\ndream of leaving it was now one of those extravagant hopes which only\r\nspring from madness—watched, guarded, surrounded, menaced as I was by\r\ngaolers a thousand times more crafty and cruel than the Malay pirates.\r\nI re-examined all the doors; I barricaded them more efficiently, and\r\ndecided not to behold the light of day any more, since I could no longer\r\nenjoy it without looking upon that sinister and menacing cordon of\r\nbesiegers; I lighted some candles, and installed myself in these lower\r\napartments as though it were for eternity.\r\n\r\nAfter having examined my provisions, I believed in the possibility of\r\nspending at least three years in this vault without dying of hunger and\r\nthirst. But at the end of fifteen days of this existence, insipid and\r\nmonotonous as sleep, I found myself exposed to an intolerable suffering\r\nproduced by the exceptional kind of life which I was leading. But before\r\nI say anything further about this unforeseen calamity, I have to speak\r\nof another misery by which I was beset. My poor clothes, which had been\r\nin rags for a long time past through their owner’s tribulations, had one\r\nfine day the coolness to leave me entirely. As I had neither needle nor\r\nthread to draw the rags together again, I was obliged to resign myself to\r\ngoing about perfectly naked.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience was great, for we had just entered on the season when\r\nthe nights were damp and frequently as cold as they are in Europe, and I\r\nhad nothing whatever to cover me. The apes had taken possession of every\r\nscrap of clothing and every vestige of drapery. Joined to the scantiness\r\nof my Adamite costume, this change in the temperature affected my health.\r\nI had excessive pains in the joints, accompanied by a low fever which\r\nwould not leave me. The graver inconvenience of which I have to speak\r\nis this. I have already said that water was not abundant in the offices\r\nof the verandah. In the first few days the deprivation of this natural\r\nnecessary affected me but little. I drank the different wines contained\r\nin the cases and hampers. These wines, as I have already mentioned, were\r\nvery powerful, and the necessity of quenching one’s thirst exclusively\r\nwith these ardent liquids without the moderating admixture of water\r\nparched up my throat to that extent that I was always thirsty, and the\r\nmore I drank the more thirsty I became. How could I appease this thirst?\r\nAh! with how much delight I would have given a hundred bottles of\r\nchampagne for a single glass of water! For an entire fortnight I endured\r\nthis suffering, which became every hour more poignant; the crisis,\r\nhowever, was approaching; my tongue was as dry as a piece of leather, my\r\neyes were swollen and bloodshot, my hands were burning with fever, my\r\nbrain throbbed against my skull.\r\n\r\nIn my lucid moments I demonstrated to myself how very false our tastes\r\nare in our artificial life of civilisation. People in a certain position\r\nwould never condescend to drink water, despised water, and yet partaking\r\ncontinuously for a fortnight of the best wines and rarest liquors had\r\nalmost made me mad. Since this painful passage of my existence I have\r\nalways had a religious respect for rivers, and I admire the Hindoos, who\r\nrightly regard the Ganges, my beautiful Indian river, as sacred.\r\n\r\nWith my blood heated by fever, and driven to extremities by suffering,\r\nI darted one day up the staircase which led to Admiral Campbell’s\r\nstudy, opened the cupboard containing the arms, and loaded the thirty\r\nfowling-pieces which I found there; I then carried them with the packets\r\nof ammunition to the bell-tower, where I proceeded to break two panes\r\nof glass in the turret, so as to make loopholes of them. This done, and\r\nvowing the death of my adversaries or else my own, I place myself in a\r\nposition to open fire against those who prevent my obtaining water from\r\nthe lake, the beautiful blue of which I could perceive in the distance.\r\n\r\nBut what an unexpected spectacle met my sight through the loopholes of my\r\ntower, which would become a redoubt in a few seconds’ time! I had left\r\ntwo or three thousand apes on the watch on the day when I descended from\r\nit, with the intention of never again re-ascending. To-day they are\r\nincreased to twenty thousand at the very least! But who could pretend\r\nto count them? As well try to count the insects swarming in the ocean\r\nof space on a summer’s evening under the line! A month ago the apes had\r\ngathered near them only some insignificant heaps of stones; now these\r\nheaps have increased to that enormous extent that they are perfect hills\r\nof projectiles, placed, too, so close to one another that they have\r\nraised, as it were, the field of battle and the camp of the besiegers\r\nto the highest point of the verandah. The bell-tower, which formerly\r\noverlooked everything, is now itself overlooked. Instead of being\r\nelevated above all around, it is depressed.\r\n\r\nBut no matter! I determine to open fire; and I do so, letting fly right\r\ninto the midst of this mass of living creatures. I had loaded each\r\ngun with six small bullets, so that at the first fire I knock over an\r\nourang-outang, a mandrill, and a baboon; what besides I know not. It was\r\nnecessary that I should kill, and I do kill. I seize with a like frenzy\r\nanother gun, and fire with the same result; I make gaps in their line\r\ntwenty-four feet in extent. But at the moment when, drunk with my heroic\r\nslaughter, I am about to fire my third gun, a dense shower of stones\r\ndescends on the front, sides, and indeed every part of the verandah. What\r\na frightful row! The noise of this shower of stones mixed with handfuls\r\nof sand, and accompanied as it was by sneering grunts from foul mouths\r\noverflowing with abuse, is not possible to be rendered in words. To\r\nconvey any idea of them it would be necessary to have the instruments\r\nthemselves, to have rough steel files grating harshly against angles\r\nof granite. Amidst this horrible din the report of my guns even can be\r\nno longer heard. All that I am certain of, all that I can distinguish\r\nclearly, is that I keep on killing; I kill by twenties, by hundreds, in\r\nfact; but these twenties, these hundreds who utter their death-shriek and\r\nfall over, are immediately replaced. The moment at last arrives when I\r\nam obliged to pause to reload my arms. But my adversaries do not pause!\r\nThey simply redouble their fire. It is then I perceive that the great art\r\nof war is not a whit less familiar to animals than to men. Both alike\r\nhave recourse to the most subtle ruses. For instance, at the very moment\r\nwhen I was about to give way, Karabouffi, till then hidden behind some\r\ntrees, made his appearance, to give, as it were, a new inspiration to\r\nhis troops. The great Condé used to rush forward and throw his marshal’s\r\nbaton within Senef’s lines. Karabouffi, like the great French general,\r\nthrew his baton of defiance through the air.\r\n\r\nIt caused my overthrow. The baboon’s stick was so well aimed that it\r\nentered like an arrow through the turret of the bell-tower, struck me,\r\nand sent me rolling to the bottom. My rage was unbounded.\r\n\r\nAlthough somewhat dizzy from my fall, I nevertheless remounted as\r\nquickly as I had descended. But from this moment such a fearful storm of\r\nprojectiles rained on the turret that it soon became unroofed. The four\r\nsides seemed as though they were about to fall. It was time vigorously\r\nto retake the offensive, and I do so. I recommence firing, although my\r\nface was lacerated, several of my teeth broken, my fingers literally\r\nflayed, and my breast bleeding. The reader has not forgotten that I was\r\nnaked. Twenty times before night, which never before seemed to me so slow\r\nin coming, I reloaded my thirty guns. What desperate work! The greater\r\npart of them, however, were beginning to be no longer of any use, for\r\nthey required cleaning; three had burst in my hands. Fortunately, night\r\nat length came and threw its mantle over this scene of carnage, without\r\nparallel, I believe, in the world’s history. Animals, although they are\r\nsaid to be more wicked than men, do not fight at night. They ceased their\r\nfire and I ceased mine. Victory was for the time undecided.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, however, it was they who had already gained it, since\r\nan enemy who can reinforce himself without ceasing, were he twenty times,\r\nwere he indeed a hundred times, less clever and brave than his adversary,\r\nmust triumph in the end. Victory, then, is only number.\r\n\r\nI descended into my vault more ill than ever. Excitement had joined\r\nitself to fever, and fever to despair. A cold shivering took possession\r\nof me, my teeth chattered. The air was far more chilly than it had been\r\nduring the preceding nights. I felt that I should perish with the cold,\r\nunless I had the marvellous good luck to find some covering to throw\r\nover me. While I was feeling in one of Lord Campbell’s boxes for some\r\nammunition for the next day, I placed my hand on the thick fur of a skin,\r\nsoft as silk. Delighted at the discovery, I examined it all over, and\r\nwhile considering its prodigious size was struck with the idea that this\r\nfine fur must be the skin of the gigantic mandrill killed by Admiral\r\nCampbell, that same mandrill whose skeleton, hanging to a mimosa, had\r\nstruck me with surprise and fear in the dim glimmering moonlight.\r\n\r\nI wrapped myself up in this superb black fur, which was as warm as that\r\nof a bear. I did better: I placed my legs in those of the animal, my arms\r\nin his arms, or rather I applied those parts of the skin to my own arms\r\nand legs. Then I fastened the whole with the aid of a piece of string, so\r\nthat I should not lose any portion of the warmth through any openings.\r\nLastly, being able to have a cap of the same fur which had furnished me\r\nwith coat and trousers, I applied the skin of the mandrill’s head to my\r\nown. When all was arranged I looked at myself in a glass—I drew back in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nWith my brown skin, thin cheeks, and open mouth, which allowed my teeth\r\nto be seen, my prominent cheek-bones, long dishevelled hair falling over\r\nmy shoulders, and two months’ beard matted together with my hair, with\r\nmy eyes rendered restless and melancholy by the fever which was pressing\r\nupon me, I took myself for the mandrill whose black dress suit I was\r\nwearing. It is not possible to imagine a more striking resemblance. I\r\nwas troubled at it, troubled to such a degree that I commenced to jump\r\nand gambol over the chairs and tables to assure myself by these acts of\r\nstupidity that I was still possessed of my manly dignity. Alas! must I\r\nconfess it? If I had not entirely lost it, it was seriously compromised,\r\nfor in this skin I found myself to be endowed with an elasticity and\r\nflexibility altogether alarming.\r\n\r\nThe day had scarcely broke when it became necessary for me to remount\r\nto the clock-tower, and to do it very quickly. This time it was not I\r\nwho opened fire, but my adversaries. I had set them the example the day\r\nbefore, and they followed it to-day. This commencement of hostilities\r\nturned out badly for me—in fact, very badly. At the end of five minutes\r\nthe wall fronting the verandah, weak as all walls of this construction\r\nusually are, gave way and fell under the shock of stones. The bell-tower,\r\nwhich was partly sustained by this principal wall, trembled at its base.\r\nI was lost—my last moments were approaching; I was separated from them\r\nonly by a few seconds. Everything was crumbling around me. There remained\r\nto me the choice of being crushed under the remains of the verandah\r\nor of precipitating myself into the midst of this crowd of savage and\r\nexasperated beings, maddened with the thoughts of vengeance, intoxicated\r\nwith the idea of a victory which they knew very well could not escape\r\nthem. I decided to die like a man. I seized hold of a Malay poignard with\r\none hand and a revolver in the other, and leaped into the centre of the\r\narena.\r\n\r\nI fell to the ground, when, just as I believed myself about to disappear\r\nbeneath a perfect network of claws, a wide space was cleared before\r\nme. The entire army of apes drew back with respect, with terror, with\r\ncast-down looks and stricken spirits.\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck. But let us pursue the story of this sudden change of\r\nfortune, which we may almost regard in the light of a resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    Whence this enchanted skin comes.—I owe to it my life and the\r\n    crown.—In what manner I govern.—I learn the fate of the English\r\n    station.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrawling on their bellies after the manner of serpents, these new\r\nreptiles came towards me. Karabouffi crawled at their head. Overwhelmed\r\nby fear, his enormous head had disappeared between his shoulders; his\r\nquickened breath swept over the ground; his body, far more considerable\r\nin its natural state than that of a tall man, was now nothing but a\r\nflattened and trembling trunk pressed against the earth. When he had\r\nreached my feet he licked them for more than a quarter of an hour; and\r\nthis act of abasement over, he moved a little on one side to make room\r\nfor others, who in their turn licked my feet as he had done. Not one of\r\nthem was bold enough to render a similar act of homage to my hands. These\r\nabject proceedings of theirs confounded me with astonishment.\r\n\r\nBut what did it all mean? For surely this singular homage of which I had\r\nbeen the object must be open to some kind of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was this: that with my mandrill’s skin, my mandrill’s\r\nhead, my mandrill’s breast, my mandrill’s hands and legs, I was\r\ntaken—now you will guess it all—for the gigantic mandrill whom\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell had suspected to be, and not, as we see, without\r\nreason, an old sovereign of Kouparou. Yes, I was taken for that same\r\ngreat mandrill who would have disembowelled Karabouffi had not Admiral\r\nCampbell knocked the monster over with a ball from his fowling-piece.\r\n\r\nThis fanatic veneration of theirs, instead of diminishing, only\r\nincreased. It became a universal sentiment. An Indian god is not more\r\nadored by his superstitious worshippers than I was by these grovelling\r\napes. I might have walked, stamping on this living carpet, without even a\r\nskin daring to move.\r\n\r\nI was, then, saved? Without doubt; but I was also become an ape. More\r\nthan that! I was unquestionably recognised as king by all the apes of\r\nKouparou. And how had all this been brought about? Why, in precisely the\r\nsame way that other sovereigns had raised themselves to power—by firing a\r\nfew guns, by losing my head, and by disguising myself in the garments of\r\nan illustrious predecessor.\r\n\r\nSince it was so, and since it was necessary either to “perish or reign,”\r\nas they say, I believe, in tragedies, and in actual life as well, I\r\nresigned myself to reign, although my people appeared very ugly-looking\r\nin my eyes. But I had no choice.\r\n\r\nThis resolution being taken, I generously extended my paw to my\r\npredecessor Karabouffi, whom I raised by this dignified movement, easily\r\ncomprehended, to the high rank of prime minister.\r\n\r\nThis first act of authority exercised by me prodigiously astonished all\r\naround; but I perceived that on the whole it gave great satisfaction. My\r\ngood sense, then, had not deceived me. I had always said to myself, and\r\nthat long before a nation of apes had placed the sceptre in my hands,\r\nthat it was bad policy on the part of a minister to torment, abase, and\r\npunish those whom he was called upon to aid in governing, since if he\r\nshould act thus, if he should listen to the inspirations of hate, or to\r\ncounsels bewildered by fear, he is certain to create for himself secret\r\nand implacable enemies, critics ever ready to condemn all his actions,\r\nwho are so much the more to be feared since they foment discontent among\r\nthe people, who, while regretting the loss of that liberty which they no\r\nlonger possess, will indulge in the hope that one day it may again be\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nAnd how very difficult, if not impossible, is rendered the return to\r\npower of those who have been overthrown if they are only left where they\r\nhave fallen! An open tolerance which will only lower them still more is\r\npreferable to raising them up by a marked display of aversion, or by a\r\ncolouring of persecution, no matter how faint.\r\n\r\nI exercised, then, no severity against Karabouffi, who, it must be\r\nremembered, had had the generosity, when I was entirely in his power, not\r\nto flay me alive from head to foot.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever forbearance I may have been disposed to exercise\r\ntowards Karabouffi, I could not avoid the performance of one act which\r\nI knew would be very mortifying to his self-love and passions. But by\r\nthe side of that prudence which I had just shown it was necessary that\r\nI should show a like degree of energy and equity. Moreover, in what I\r\nproposed doing I was only about to extend the principle in accordance\r\nwith which I had spared Karabouffi himself. All the vervets, all the old\r\nfollowers of the mandrill whose place I occupied, were brought from exile\r\nand disgrace. Some old ourang-outangs, some baboons of the late reign,\r\nsome old Dianas, wearing cocked hats crowned with big plumes stolen from\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell’s station, murmured behind their beards. But I took\r\nno notice of their suppressed disgust. I knew the step that I was taking\r\nwas a politic one, for it conciliated the others. One is always strong\r\nwhen one is in the right. The consequence was that the grand dignitaries\r\nof all kinds, those who held the rank of judges, generals, and grand\r\nofficers of the palace, smiled at the proposition, and welcomed the\r\noutlaws with open arms. Vervets and baboons embraced one another weeping.\r\nWas the reconciliation sincere? It is very doubtful. Those who have an\r\ninterest in keeping parties divided say that it is perilous to society to\r\nbring them together; but to continue my story—for these reflections are\r\nout of place.\r\n\r\nThe most cruel trial to which I was obliged to expose my predecessor, in\r\nspite of my well-known character for humanity, was this. Followed by all\r\nmy subjects and the members of my court, and having my prime minister\r\nKarabouffi on my right hand, I directed my steps towards the prison of\r\nthe unfortunate Mococo. The _cortège_ was a most imposing one. We arrived\r\nat length in front of the horrible iron cage, on the floor of which\r\nlay the poor captive pining away through grief and love. The faithful\r\nSaïmira, who was at this moment consoling him through the bars, started\r\nback at the appearance of this crowd. She believed that we had come to\r\nseek her lover to drag him to the scaffold. How was I to undeceive her\r\nwithout betraying myself?\r\n\r\nThe event soon reassured her. After setting Mococo free, I placed his\r\ntrembling hand in that of the gentle Saïmira, and made the two lovers\r\nunderstand, by keeping them for some minutes locked as it were in this\r\nsoft pressure, that I united them in the face of this huge assembly,\r\nwhich had no doubt often seen among themselves infinitely worse assorted\r\nunions. At the sight of this happiness, which I had been the means of\r\nprocuring for my two poor chimpanzees, Karabouffi rent the air with a\r\ncry of despair and rage. I pitied his position, and to spare him the\r\nslow agony of witnessing day by day the love which existed between this\r\nhappy couple, I sent the two chimpanzees away for a time. They went\r\nunder my protection to spend their honeymoon in an isolated spot which\r\nI had selected for them in a corner of the island, a charming retreat\r\nsurrounded by clear and limpid waters, by pink and yellow convolvuli,\r\nand mysterious flowers which, opening only during the night, would not\r\nyield their perfume to the sun. The lady-monkeys, I am happy to say,\r\nappeared highly satisfied with my conduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They went to spend their honeymoon in an isolated spot\r\nwhich I had selected for them.—_Page 130._]\r\n\r\nThis commencement of a reign in appearance so easy did not leave me\r\naltogether without inquietude, although I hasten to declare after\r\nexperience that nothing is more easy than to govern, and to govern well.\r\nWhen I was a bird-fancier at Macao, I have often found it more difficult\r\nto sell a parrot than it proved to become master of the wills of one\r\nhundred thousand subjects of by no means pliable natures who had fallen\r\nto my care.\r\n\r\nBut I must here mention the grave inquietude which troubled me in the\r\nearly days of my reign. How could I feel perfectly tranquil so long as\r\nthe mandrill’s skeleton remained suspended to the tree in the mimosa\r\nforest? The first one among my new subjects who might perceive it would\r\nnot fail to divulge the fact to the others; and then what would become\r\nof me? How could I be at the same time both living and dead—hung and yet\r\nreigning? It would be indeed vexatious for a sovereign to have his own\r\nskeleton brought against him as a witness.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, then, at all risks to put an end to this embarrassment.\r\nThe simplest way, the reader will think, would be to get rid of this\r\nconfounded skeleton; the simplest way—yes, but not for me, since I\r\nwas constantly surrounded by thousands of courtiers. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, during one of those stormy nights which are rarely known in other\r\ncountries of the world—one of those nights, in fact, of brimstone\r\nand electricity which make tigers and elephants fall asleep on their\r\nknees, the air is so heavy to their eyes and brains—I sallied forth. My\r\nbody-guards, chamberlains, and valets-de-chambre slept too soundly to\r\nhave been aroused even by the trumpet of the last judgment. The wind\r\ndrove the clouds so rapidly through the sky, that the moon appeared\r\nto leave its orbit and fall with all its weight to the horizon, to\r\nremount as rapidly to the zenith. Trees a hundred and forty feet high\r\nwere snapped like reeds, and after having been blown down, and then into\r\nthe air again, twirled round me like whirlwinds of straw; a single dry\r\nleaf—it is true some are half a yard long—catching me a blow would have\r\ncut me in two with the cleanness of a razor. I saw this hurricane mow\r\ndown portions of the forests in the space of three minutes, and clear\r\nthe ground bare to the solid rock. One would not understand how it was\r\nthat I was not carried away like an atom, if one were ignorant of the\r\nfact that these hurricanes proceed by currents, which vary but little in\r\nextent. There are bands—kinds of lines almost as regular as if drawn to\r\nscale. Well, two paces from the tempest one can see it pass without being\r\ntouched by it in the slightest degree. Such was the night chosen by me\r\nfor my expedition.\r\n\r\nNo one saw me leave the verandah. I stole away in the shade, and, hidden\r\nby the contortions of the tempest, gained the wood of mimosas where I\r\nknew that my skeleton was hanging up. I say my skeleton, since henceforth\r\nI considered myself in all respects as neither more nor less than the\r\nmandrill discovered by Admiral Campbell. In due course I arrived at the\r\ntree, suspended to which were my poor bones rattling in the wind, when,\r\nafter having dug a trench seven feet long, I interred myself with all\r\npossible precautions. I covered myself over at first with vegetable\r\nearth, then with sand, then with turf, and lastly with a layer of dry\r\nleaves. At this strange and solemn moment I believed myself a far more\r\nextraordinary personage than the Emperor Charles V. He only assisted\r\nat his own funeral procession at the Convent of Saint-Just, whereas\r\nI, Polydorus Marasquin, performed my own obsequies, and was my own\r\nundertaker, gravedigger, and mourner. Surely it will not be disputed that\r\nI was the first example of a sovereign or even of a man who had buried\r\nhimself with his own hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After having dug a trench seven feet long, I interred\r\nmyself with all possible precautions.—_Page 132._]\r\n\r\nSo soon as I was fairly under the turf I turned my thoughts to the\r\nfuture, and occupied myself with studying how to reign well. Subjects\r\ngenerally render this task easy enough to their rulers. They are\r\ndetermined at every hazard to believe the successor infinitely superior\r\nin all things to his predecessor. Let him do what he may, he is always\r\nmore intelligent, energetic, and generous. This is the first stage of\r\nforced popularity. Even Nero, Louis XI. of France, and George IV. of\r\nEngland, have not escaped it. The second stage of popularity often to a\r\nnew sovereign is for him to be always doing exactly the reverse of his\r\npredecessor. If the latter was fond of talking, then it should be your\r\naim to be silent; if he was silent, you should be fond of talking; if he\r\nalways went out on foot, you should never go out except on horseback;\r\nif he went out on horseback, you should only go out on foot; if he\r\nwas proud, you should be familiar; if he was familiar, you should be\r\nproud; if he was peaceful, you should be warlike; if he was warlike, you\r\nshould be peaceful; if he loved the arts, you should despise them; if\r\nhe despised them, you ought to pretend to love them; if he adored his\r\nchildren, you should remain a bachelor; if he practised celibacy, you\r\nought in this case to marry; if he scattered gold about, your plan would\r\nbe to be saving; if he was miserly, then you should scatter your gold\r\nwith an open hand. I have said sufficient for the reader to perceive the\r\nvalue of my theory. Let us pass now, so far as the matter concerns me, to\r\nthe application of it.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that not having really to govern men, but\r\ncreatures vastly inferior to them, who bore, however, at the same time, a\r\ngrim resemblance to mankind in general, I did not have occasion to apply\r\nmy theory in all its rigour. I simply set myself to work to see how I\r\ncould twist it so as to turn to my own purposes minds which were alike\r\ninconsistent, frivolous, and, as we all know, imitative to a degree.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, Karabouffi, had urged on his subjects, now my subjects,\r\nto destroy my comfortable verandah. I could not imagine anything\r\nmore agreeable to them than to decree its immediate reconstruction.\r\nI therefore took some of the stones detached by the force of their\r\nprojectiles, and in their presence placed them one upon another in\r\nthe symmetrical order which they had occupied before their overthrow.\r\nImmediately, as if by a fairy’s command, the stones were placed in a most\r\nworkmanlike manner. I filled up the interstices with plaster which I had\r\nmixed with water to serve as a kind of mortar; at the same moment all\r\nmy subjects, seized with a rage for building, pounded plaster, broke up\r\nfreestone, carried water, mixed, stirred, and made me mortar sufficient\r\nto rebuild the Tower of Babel. They presented a curious sight, whitened\r\nall over as they were with plaster, even to their moustaches, elbows, and\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nKarabouffi, on seeing the part which I took with his old subjects, looked\r\nas if he were thinking how easy it would have been for him to have\r\nfollowed the same course, and to have arrived at the same end. He was\r\nright, no doubt, but he had not done so.\r\n\r\nHowever, warned as he now was by experience, should he ever regain his\r\nsceptre, all he would then have to do to render himself popular would be\r\nto demolish my work.\r\n\r\nThe verandah raised from its ruins, I traced through the neighbouring\r\nwoods four splendid roads, several leagues in length, all radiating from\r\na given point, and all leading to the sea. These magnificent openings\r\nwere completed in a few days, and by the same simple means as those I\r\nhad had recourse to when engaged in the reconstruction of my palace. I\r\ncommenced by felling three trees to the right and three trees to the\r\nleft of the four lines representing the four routes to be opened in the\r\nthicknesses of the forest. Immediately hands and hatchets were hard at\r\nwork felling trees. It was like a renewal of the hurricane with which I\r\nwas assailed on the night of my funeral. My object in opening these four\r\nroads was to catch sight from as far off as possible of any vessel that\r\nmight touch at the island, and be the means of setting me free.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily understand that when once I had secured for\r\nmyself something like liberty in my movements, I did not rest without\r\nsearching for any vestiges which might be scattered about the island, and\r\nwhich might give a clue to the fatal lot which had, in all probability,\r\nbefallen the brave sailors of the naval station. My investigations were\r\nattended with the following result:—While examining the land-locked\r\nbay which Admiral Campbell’s journal indicated as the anchorage of the\r\nHalcyon, I was struck by a circumstance which clearly proved that this\r\nfine frigate had not left the bay in accordance with the ordinary rules\r\nof navigation. Had she done so she would have raised her anchor and the\r\nbuoys which marked the spot where they had been dropped. Instead of this\r\nthe buoys were in their places, and I had only to slip my hand under\r\none of them to assure myself that the anchors had never been weighed.\r\nIn their thievish haste the pirates had cut the cables above the buoys,\r\nand had thus set the frigate free in order to carry her off, Heaven only\r\nknows where.\r\n\r\nI was, then, irrevocably condemned to endure my present lot; my original\r\ndeductions had proved to be correct. The entire naval station had become\r\nthe prey of the Malay scum of the archipelago of Sooloo.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the expedition undertaken by me to the Halcyon’s\r\nanchorage, I ought not to omit mentioning that I was accompanied on this\r\noccasion by the various dignitaries of my household. Their zeal carried\r\nthem so far as to induce them to throw themselves into the water with me\r\nwhen I swam to the place where the buoys were floating, through want of a\r\nboat or canoe to take me there. The reader will see that if the affection\r\nof my subjects for my royal person was all that could be desired, my\r\nmarine was nevertheless in a very inefficient state.\r\n\r\nI returned to my dominions, after this short absence, amid the\r\nacclamations of my subjects, who evidently grew more and more fond of\r\nme. I must mention here that the one thing which made me more popular\r\nthan ever among them, and which marvellously proved the efficacy of my\r\ngovernmental theory, was being in respect of the matter of dress the\r\nexact opposite of my predecessor, who was accustomed, even up to the\r\nmoment of his unmerited fall, to dress himself out in a most ridiculous\r\nstyle, whereas I went totally naked. One can scarcely believe how much\r\nthis contrast helped to keep me in favour. “What simplicity!” murmured\r\nthey; “how natural and charming! He shows his bare back as we do, and is\r\njust as ugly as we are.”\r\n\r\nThis proves that it is not necessary always to wear a theatrical-shaped\r\nhat in order to be regarded as a great king. I am, however, bound to\r\nacknowledge that this habit of reigning quite naked was productive to\r\nme of more bitter distress than it is possible to imagine; it made me,\r\nmoreover, incur the most serious dangers, considering the exceptional\r\nposition in which I was placed. When I think of the matter a cold shiver\r\nruns through me, my hair stands on end, my heart fails me, and I feel as\r\nthough I am on the point of fainting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    Royal happiness troubled by a rent.—I am more and more adored\r\n    by my subjects.—A cloud in the sky.—Sinister preoccupation.—My\r\n    kingdom for a pair of trousers!—Supreme joy of being an\r\n    animal.—My happiness again troubled.—A fatal tear.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, on the occasion of a grand military review, when I was cutting\r\nsolemn capers before my subjects by way of saluting them, the mandrill’s\r\nskin, in which, as a matter of course, I was always clad, unfortunately\r\ncracked!—it cracked, too, as a matter of course, at the part where it\r\nfitted me tightest, and where it was certainly a little worn—in other\r\nwords, at the part on which the mandrill during his lifetime had been\r\naccustomed to seat himself. An unusual chill followed this deplorable\r\nrent. It was like the mask falling off in the middle of the ball. I felt\r\nthat I was lost—that the man was recognised beneath the skin of the ape,\r\nand that my reign, my greatness, and my life were at an end.\r\n\r\nAlas! I had not foreseen how short a time even the most illustrious skins\r\nlast! What imprudence! or rather what a misfortune! Had my subjects\r\nalready perceived my accident, and what did they think of it if they\r\nhad perceived it? It was a most grave situation. I no longer dared to\r\nmake a single military movement during the continuance of the review,\r\nwhich appeared, indeed, endless to me, I was suffering so much from\r\nanxiety and fear. No one can imagine the ruses to which I was compelled\r\nto have recourse so as to pass in front of the ranks, and at the same\r\ntime conceal from my troops the misfortune which had befallen me, and\r\nthe discovery of which would have been the signal for my death. I hid my\r\ndisaster as well as I could, I dodged about in a nervous way, and finally\r\nI gained the verandah, where I arrived more dead than alive.\r\n\r\nI passed a most horrible night; I passed it in endeavoring, by all\r\nmanner of ingenious contrivances, to repair the rent in my skin. Oh!\r\nhow I applied myself to my task! but I was consoled by the reflection\r\nthat it was for my reign that I was labouring. I succeeded in repairing\r\nthe damage in a fashion which, to the eye of a casual observer, would\r\nhave looked all that could be desired, but I saw perfectly well that\r\nthe reparation would not hold out long against the strain which would\r\nnecessarily be upon it whenever I had occasion either to walk or sit\r\ndown. It was certain that I could not always remain standing during the\r\nentire length of my reign. Human misery mounts in some degree to the\r\nsummit of the highest of human dignities. Fancy a government, a state,\r\na reign having to depend upon the strength of the stitches in a cracked\r\npair of breeches.\r\n\r\nAt length the night ended, and at daybreak my subjects, who had believed\r\nme indisposed during the review of the previous day, pressed under the\r\nbalcony to have news of my health. Their anxiety was such that it was\r\nabsolutely necessary for me to show myself. I accordingly appeared in the\r\nbalcony, when, oh horror! I was obliged to go through salute after salute\r\nwith the risk of dislocating my limbs, and the more dangerous risk of\r\ndisarranging my nether clothing in order to prove to them the greatness\r\nof my affection, somersault after somersault that I might ravish them\r\nwith admiration. I was, moreover, obliged, in response to the enthusiasm\r\nof my subjects, to descend into their midst, by means of a rope slung\r\nfor this purpose between the balcony and the ground. With what prudence\r\nI performed this descent, a prudence which will appear the reverse of\r\nroyal to very many people! How I guarded against the least tension of the\r\nmuscles! How I waited till I was nearly to the ground before I darted\r\namong my people!\r\n\r\nEverything passed off very well, thank Heaven! although certain\r\nover-zealous sapajous from time to time poked forth their heads and\r\npointed muzzles as though to assure themselves that they must have\r\nseen but indifferently the evening before. This was indeed a perilous\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nAt length escaping the caresses of my subjects, I thanked Heaven for the\r\nsuccess of my reparation, but I was not the less convinced that my reign\r\ndepended upon this skin of mine; that the duration of the one depended\r\nupon that of the other; and that this skin, a symbol of my destiny, would\r\ngrow thinner every day, and become, sooner or later, my ruin.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of ages has proclaimed that “There is no perfect happiness\r\nin this world.” I could have been as happy as a man has the right to be\r\nin a position so strange as mine if it had not been that this skin was\r\nconstantly threatening to give way. In all other respects, tranquil in my\r\nundisputed sovereignty, I felt almost the joy of a released captive in my\r\nclose association with Nature in her most primitive form—an association\r\nfor which mankind are designed, and for which, when sated with an\r\nartificial state of existence, they are always longing in order that they\r\nmay grow young again.\r\n\r\nCivilised life, of whose doubtful advantages we boast with more pride\r\nthan reflection, is, in my opinion, not an advance, but a deviation.\r\nThat pure and lusty air which I was breathing, becoming absorbed into\r\nmy entire system, gave me other tastes. My desires grew purer. That\r\nbeautiful fruit and limpid water became sufficient for my appetite when I\r\nfound myself freed from the excitement and irritation which is frequently\r\nthe result of immoderate exercise.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I felt a kind of horror at the notion of feeding oneself on\r\nthe flesh of animals. It is to civilisation alone, I said, that we owe\r\nthose abominable appetites which require the flesh of animals to satisfy\r\nthem. When the cannibal eats his enemy it is more from vengeance than\r\nmere gluttony, whereas the reason we do not eat one another arises, not\r\nfrom any particular respect for our kind, but rather from an unmistakable\r\ndistaste for human flesh, and, above all, from a fear, into which we are\r\nreciprocally forced, that if we ate our kind, our kind would, in all\r\nprobability, retaliate by eating us. The savage, therefore, is simply a\r\nstupid to eat his enemy.\r\n\r\nThis very mandrill’s skin, of which, for the first few days, I was\r\nthoroughly ashamed, eventually appeared to me a thousand times preferable\r\nto those odious shells of cloth, those coats of mail, which do not allow\r\nus the free use of our limbs, adopted and rejected in turn by the idiotcy\r\nof fashion. Under this soft and elastic skin, supple, thin, and warm, all\r\nat the same time, it was as pleasant as it was easy to bend the body—to\r\nswing from bough to bough, to drop down on to the turf, and bound up\r\nagain; to run, to glide through the bushes, climb up the bamboos, leave\r\nthe land and plunge into the water, quit the water to climb up a rock,\r\nand seat oneself on its summit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, I was not permitted to go through these movements\r\nwith perfect freedom of mind. The reader knows well enough what was the\r\nobstacle that prevented me. One day this obstacle, through some terrible\r\naccident, assumed proportions so large that the world contained neither\r\nneedles nor tailors capable of effecting a restoration.\r\n\r\nThis is how the accident in question happened:—\r\n\r\nI was accustomed, the reader should know, to sleep in my mandrill’s skin,\r\nfor to have thrown it off, even during the hours of sleep, would have\r\nbeen extremely imprudent. Well, one night I had an extraordinary dream;\r\nin this dream, inspired by an instinct of ambition, for which I can in\r\nno wise account, I caused myself to be crowned King of Kouparou by the\r\nArchbishop of Goa. I to have had myself crowned! What an aberration of\r\nmind! I, above all, who reigned only in virtue of a deceit, only because\r\ncreatures of weak intellect believed that they saw in me an old King of\r\nKouparou, whereas it was merely his skin which they recognized, and which\r\nI had made use of. Mind, it was only a dream up to this point—but I will\r\nfinish the narration.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by his clergy, in their most magnificent vestments and\r\nresplendent with diamonds, Monseigneur de Goa, after performing all the\r\nceremonies used at the coronations of kings, took a crown of gold and\r\nemeralds in his hand, and walked solemnly towards me to place it on my\r\nhead. This was the moment of the catastrophe. As the archbishop, who\r\nstood on the _haut pas_, was raised above me, I was obliged, in order to\r\nreceive the crown which he offered me, to stretch out my arms, in order\r\nto assist him in placing the crown on my head. Well, in leaning towards\r\nthe archbishop I fancy I must have stretched the mandrill’s skin a trifle\r\ntoo much. There was a sudden rending, and this time the fatal slit\r\nextended right down from the neck to the very end of the back. The noise\r\ncaused by this accident was so loud that it awoke me.\r\n\r\nAnd what an awakening! That compactly-fitting garment was now nothing but\r\na floating paletôt, open behind instead of before. I rose up alarmed,\r\ndismayed, and desperate. I wished to doubt my senses, but my misfortune\r\nwas, alas! only too real, and what an irreparable misfortune it was,\r\nsince instruments and means which were not at my disposal were necessary\r\nto reunite the shreds of my royal purple. My reign was at an end, and\r\nwhat was more, my life would soon follow the example of my reign, and\r\nall in consequence of this hateful rent. So certain did I feel of the\r\nfate which awaited me that I barricaded myself that very instant, and set\r\nto work to fortify my position behind the verandah walls just as I had\r\ndone when I was once before obliged to transform this pretty dwelling of\r\nAdmiral Campbell’s into a fortress.\r\n\r\nThe next day when my subjects did not see me come forth they assembled\r\nin large numbers under my windows, and I had to undergo the sorrow of\r\nwitnessing their truly touching solicitude without daring to show myself\r\nso as to reassure them. The following day they again assembled in great\r\nnumbers; the third day the entire population of the island thronged\r\naround the verandah.\r\n\r\nThen the affection of my devoted subjects, which up to this point had\r\nbeen manifested by silent expressions of their grief, broke forth in\r\nnoisy whines, deafening bursts of sympathy, and groans that were meant\r\nto be expressive of tenderness. My ears were afflicted even more than my\r\nheart. My subjects wished for me, called me, demanded me at any price.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I saw distinctly enough how animals the most deficient\r\nin moral courage are not ashamed of the feelings of gratitude which\r\nthey owed their sovereign. They do not, like beings of a higher order\r\nof intelligence, forget in a single day the benefits which he has been\r\nthe means of showering down upon them, the equal justice which he has\r\ndispensed to them, the order and happiness with which he has surrounded\r\nthem at the expense of his own ease and pleasure, in order to throw\r\nthemselves at the feet of a new master whose wisdom and virtue have not\r\nyet been tried—cowardly slaves of novelty, ready and willing to treat the\r\naugust chief of their community like children treat their playthings, who\r\nalways think the last the prettiest, and that the preceding one deserves\r\nonly to be broken violently against the wall.\r\n\r\nTruth wills that I should add that this love of my subjects took a\r\nsomewhat strange turn after five days of patient waiting without result.\r\nIntending to come to me, as I would not come to them, they commenced a\r\nnew siege of the verandah and with the same weapons of attack—namely,\r\nsticks and stones—arms which had formerly proved so successful in their\r\nhands. And this time, actuated as they were by a noble sentiment, they\r\nshowed themselves incomparably more obstinate in their determination\r\nto overthrow the walls behind which I sought to escape their too\r\ndemonstrative affection.\r\n\r\nHow was I to remain insensible to these marks of interest? I do not\r\ndeny that I should have been better pleased to have seen this intense\r\ninterest show itself under less redoubtable forms. Still, I should have\r\nconsidered it a crime to have repulsed them this time with guns and\r\nmuskets. I offered, therefore, no resistance. On the contrary, I wept\r\nwith joy and pride when I heard the walls, roofs, windows, balconies,\r\ndoors, and framework of the verandah crackling under the weight of the\r\nenormous stones which they kept throwing against them. I confess that I\r\nwas moved by this devotion of theirs, the end of which was infallibly my\r\ndeath, since what a discovery awaited them in a very few minutes! They\r\ncounted on finding themselves in the presence of a mandrill behind the\r\nwalls which they had well-nigh overthrown, and instead of this they would\r\nplace their hands on a light-haired man, although a Portuguese, identical\r\nin every respect, more’s the pity, with all that is well-formed and most\r\nagreeable in man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    Deliverance.—I see my native land again.—O Macao!—My\r\n    immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had only to sustain this siege, instigated, I was well aware, by the\r\npurest devotion, for a very few minutes longer, to ensure being murdered\r\nwithout the shadow of a doubt; everything was being destroyed and was\r\nfalling around me, when all at once three cannon-shots sounded in the\r\ndistance. Did I hear aright? I listen. Three fresh reports follow those\r\nwhich have already aroused my attention.\r\n\r\nThank God, I am not the only one who hears them. The besiegers below have\r\nalso caught the sound.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the entire island is all attention.\r\n\r\nThe boom of the cannon is heard for the third time: there are three more\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nI start to my feet. It must be a vessel, then! a vessel which is arriving\r\nat the island! a vessel which is about to disembark someone! A vessel! a\r\nvessel! Hurrah!\r\n\r\nThe reports continue to resound.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers, confounded and uneasy at the noise of these detonations,\r\nrepeated several times over by the echoes of the island, brought their\r\noperations to a decided standstill.\r\n\r\nWith stones in their hands, with their muzzles turned in the direction\r\nof the wind, with outstretched necks, hair standing on end, and ears\r\npricked up, they sought to explain to themselves what I should have liked\r\nexceedingly to have been able to have explained myself.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? Had this vessel come to deliver me? Still all those\r\nreports could not be for me alone? Ah, no. Was it some ship in danger\r\nsignalling for assistance? Or rather, was it the Malay pirates about to\r\nmake another descent on the island? But what could they come to steal\r\nhere? They had already taken everything. Was it a battle between them and\r\nsome European ship of war?\r\n\r\nAh! my anxieties were infinite.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour after the first of these reports I heard drums, brass\r\ninstruments, and martial music. It was a disembarkation! a conquest! the\r\ntune seemed to tell of victory.\r\n\r\nMy loving and hostile subjects appeared to me more and more astounded.\r\nWith many this astonishment took the nature of fear, and some were\r\nalready seeking with furtive glances favourable openings for an immediate\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nWith these combined noises of cannons and wind instruments shouts of\r\nenthusiasm and words of command speedily became mixed. The troops were\r\nevidently advancing; were they coming in this direction? Surely they\r\nwere, since before long I saw glittering in the air, at the end of one\r\nof those fine avenues which I had had opened by my subjects, muskets,\r\nbayonets, golden sword-hilts, and brilliant uniforms. These uniforms,\r\nwhich stood out in strong relief from the blue distance, were evidently\r\nthose of the English army and navy.\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine that my sight and mind alike dwelt on the least\r\nmovements of that mass of men who advanced with such rapidity and\r\nprecision towards the spot whence my eyes were devouring them.\r\n\r\nAt a whistle, which came, I do not doubt, from the metallic lungs of\r\nKarabouffi, my prime minister, and I believe in some degree my successor\r\nin his own mind, ever since I had disregarded the love of my people, all\r\nthe apes, the strong, the cunning, the bold, the slow, the quick, the\r\nsubtle, the obstinate, completely disappeared; they vanished like air\r\nthrough the openings: not a single one remained!\r\n\r\nThe vast space in front of the verandah was empty in the twinkling of an\r\neye.\r\n\r\nAn instant after the troops occupied this space left so rapidly free by\r\nthe apes.\r\n\r\nA superior officer placed himself in the centre of the little army,\r\nwhich was formed in a circle of considerable size. What a joyous and\r\ninexpressible surprise for me! In this officer I recognised the brave\r\nVice-Admiral Campbell himself. I uttered a cry, but it was too far off to\r\nbe heard.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Campbell made a sign that he was about to speak; the men were all\r\nattention, and he said:—\r\n\r\n“Officers and men,—You all know by what a miserable snare we were carried\r\noff from this island some five months since.\r\n\r\n“You all know of the chastisement which our brave countrymen belonging\r\nto the squadron which arrived so opportunely in the Indian seas some\r\nsix months sooner than it was expected have inflicted on the Sultan of\r\nSooloo. His capital has been burnt; the Halcyon has been retaken from\r\nthe Malay pirates who had treacherously carried her off; one hundred\r\nand fifty of these scoundrels have suffered the punishment reserved for\r\npirates, and have been hung to the yard-arms of their junks and praus.\r\nIndemnities have been paid to the families of the brave sailors who have\r\nperished through this outrage committed in utter defiance of the law of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n“A further act of reparation was due to us. To-day, officers and men,\r\nwith your assistance, I retake possession of this island, in the name of\r\nHer Most Gracious Majesty!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Covered with my tattered and well-worn skin, but still\r\nholding sufficiently together for me to be taken for a mandrill.—_Page\r\n147._]\r\n\r\nLoud cheers here interrupted the vice-admiral, who, after a brief pause,\r\nconcluded with these words:—\r\n\r\n“I plant here the noble flag of England, which I now call upon you to\r\nsalute with military honours.”\r\n\r\nA number of simultaneous discharges responded to the vice-admiral’s\r\nappeal, and the British flag unfurled itself in all its majesty in the\r\ncourtyard of the verandah.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of retaking possession was about coming to a close.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that I left the ruins of the verandah, covered with\r\nmy tattered and well-worn skin, but still holding sufficiently together\r\nfor me to be taken for a mandrill by all the English present.\r\n\r\nThey were all struck with astonishment on seeing an ape of the largest\r\nkind thrust himself into the midst of their solemn meeting. Their\r\nsurprise turned into laughter, which all the detachment joined in, when\r\nthey heard me speak English to the vice-admiral. A speechifying mandrill!\r\nwell, what next? thought they.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” inquired the admiral, thoroughly embarrassed by the nature\r\nof the being—half man, half ape—which addressed him.\r\n\r\n“A Christian,” I answered, “who has lived three months among the apes.”\r\n\r\n“Are you an ape, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord. This skin is not mine.”\r\n\r\n“We are perfectly convinced of that—perfectly sure of that,” exclaimed a\r\nyoung Irish lieutenant who was standing behind me, loud enough for me to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n“But how comes it that you are wearing it? How the deuce, too, have you\r\ngot here—you, whom, if I am not mistaken, I left bird-fancier at Macao,\r\nsince I think I recognise you?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, it is a very long story, so long that I should not dare to\r\nrelate it to you if it were not intimately connected with your own.”\r\n\r\n“With mine!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord, with yours.”\r\n\r\nThey looked at me, and then burst out in another fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n“I shall take the liberty of relating it to you, my lord, when I am in\r\na more fit state of mind and body. I shall only say one word to your\r\nlordship so as to warn you that my story is worthy of attention.”\r\n\r\n“What is the word?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am the last king of this island.”\r\n\r\nThis answer was not calculated to check the jeering laughter of my\r\nhearers, who were for the most part very young, and consequently very\r\nlittle disposed to make allowances. Besides, I must admit that this\r\nhalf-naked king who stood before them clad in an ape’s tattered skin\r\nfully justified the reception accorded to my royal words.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Campbell asked me laughingly if I had any objection, as I was\r\nking, to his taking possession of the island of Kouparou.\r\n\r\nI besought him not to laugh at an unhappy man who had lost everything he\r\npossessed by his shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, shaking my hand, then said, “Mr. Marasquin, you will have\r\nlost nothing; England, I promise you, will indemnify you.”\r\n\r\nEngland has amply fulfilled the promises of the noble sailor who, a few\r\ndays after his return to the island of Kouparou, deigned to listen to\r\nthe recital of troubles I had undergone in the midst of this community\r\nof apes. He took such a lively interest in all my vicissitudes that he\r\nmade me promise to publish them in the unpretentious form in which I\r\nproduce them to-day; and I publish them, you may believe me, less from\r\nan author’s pride than as an example and an encouragement to those\r\nunfortunate beings who might be tempted to give way to discouragement\r\nand despair if they should chance to suffer shipwreck as I did, and be\r\ncast like I was, on an island peopled by apes. Besides, I look only for\r\nhonour and profit from my proper profession.\r\n\r\nThanks to the kindness of Admiral Campbell, who advanced me several sums\r\nof money, and the sympathy of his officers, who became better customers\r\nof mine than ever, I occupy an excellent position at Macao, where I carry\r\non my business of dealer in wild and tame animals.\r\n\r\nAs a sort of crown to the many kindnesses which Admiral Campbell had\r\nalready shown me, he ordered that one of the numerous isles of the Sooloo\r\nArchipelago should be called on the last geographical charts of that part\r\nof India _Polydorus Marasquin Island_.\r\n\r\nTo-day I am alike prosperous, happy, and respected. I may add, also, that\r\nI have three children and a wife who loves me.\r\n\r\nWell, would it be believed? I sometimes surprise myself murmuring between\r\nmy lips, “Ah! the old times when I was an ape!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR VON SCHLIEFFEN AND HIS MONKEYS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR VON SCHLIEFFEN AND HIS MONKEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never elsewhere seen oaks thrust forth their gnarled branches so\r\nproudly and vigorously in the air, nor slender shining beech-trees form\r\nsuch majestic arcades overhead, as those in the little wood belonging to\r\nthe Schlieffen estate of Windhausen, about three miles to the east of\r\nCassel. One is struck with astonishment and admiration on beholding these\r\ngigantic works of fertile Nature, with their sturdy trunks, often twenty\r\nor thirty feet in girth, and their magnificent foliage, beneath the\r\nshade of which the pathway winds through ferns and flowers, among cool\r\ngrottoes, arbours, hermitages, and monuments of various kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this little wood, and on the bank of a tiny lake, stands\r\na moderate-sized mansion, which has been deserted since the death of\r\nhim who erected it, and the front of which faces the rising sun. Behind\r\nare the farm buildings, hemmed in on all sides by luxuriant foliage. So\r\nsecluded is the spot that a traveller might pass almost close to the\r\nmansion without seeing it, while from afar the red-tile roofs are visible\r\nonly from the high ground.\r\n\r\nThere lived here not more than thirty or forty years ago, in\r\nphilosophical repose and contemplation, Lieutenant-General Martin Ernst\r\nvon Schlieffen, formerly Hessian Minister of State, an honourable old\r\ngentleman, and a valiant German soldier, with correct ideas of honour\r\nand right; one of the pupils of the Seven Years’ War, a lover of art\r\nand science, himself blessed with a lively fancy, and, in addition, a\r\nphilosopher and somewhat of a character. He was born in Pomerania in\r\nthe year 1732. It was his lot to receive a defective education, and,\r\nwhen scarcely more than a mere boy, the rank of ensign in a Prussian\r\nregiment. A lingering illness, which prostrated him at the expiration of\r\ntwo or three years, caused the King probably to doubt the youth’s further\r\nfitness for service, and, instead of the extension of leave demanded,\r\nto send him his dismissal. On recovering his health the youth remained\r\nfor some time without any occupation, till the outbreak of the Seven\r\nYears’ War encouraged him to offer his services once more to Frederick\r\nII. But the King would not have him, so he went, with recommendations\r\nfrom Prince Henry of Prussia and of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick in\r\nhis pocket, to Cassel, where the Landgrave made him a lieutenant in\r\nthe Hessian contingent in the pay of England. In this position he so\r\ndistinguished himself, first under the Duke of Cumberland, and then under\r\nthe latter’s successor, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, that, within five\r\nyears, he worked his way up to a colonelcy, and was summoned to Cassel as\r\nAdjutant-General and Chamberlain by the Landgrave. Court life, however,\r\ndetained him captive for only a short time, and he returned to the\r\nvictorious standard of his celebrated general, who met with so deplorable\r\na death at Jena. Herr von Schlieffen had attracted the attention of his\r\nhereditary King, and Frederick the Great now made an attempt to gain once\r\nmore to his service the man whom, but a few years previously, he had so\r\nungraciously rebuffed. But the Landgrave created him a general, and Herr\r\nvon Schlieffen continued in his service. By the advice of the Prince\r\nhe refused, also, a tempting offer from the Emperor of Russia, and, in\r\nconsideration of his so doing, the Landgrave settled upon him a life\r\nannuity of one thousand thalers. While Fortune thus lavished her gifts\r\nupon him, he devoted himself zealously to study, in order to make up for\r\nhis neglected education. He learned Greek and Latin, of which he acquired\r\nsuch a knowledge as to be capable of reading the old classic authors in\r\ntheir original language. He accompanied the Landgrave on his travels to\r\nParis and Berlin. He then proceeded, on business of his own, to Warsaw,\r\nand, on his return to Cassel, entered the ministry. He subsequently\r\nobtained the post of ambassador in London, where friends and former\r\nbrothers-in-arms essentially advanced his efforts for the benefit of\r\nhis sovereign. At length—for what is more fickle than the favour of the\r\ngreat—he incurred the displeasure of the Landgrave, and obeyed a summons\r\nto Prussia as general and governor of the fortress of Wesel. A year\r\nlater, when the Belgian provinces had torn themselves from Austria, and\r\ncreated themselves into an independent State, a message was despatched\r\nfrom the deputies assembled in Brussels to Herr von Schlieffen, inviting\r\nhim to assume the Stadtholdship. Consideration for Prussia, at that very\r\ntime engaged in negotiations for a reconciliation with Austria, made him\r\ndetermine to refuse this honour. Hereupon the King, no longer Frederick\r\nII., sent for him to Berlin, and offered him the portfolio of Foreign\r\nAffairs. But Herr von Schlieffen found the Court in so unfavourable a\r\nsituation, the influence of England so predominant, and Austria attached\r\nin so loose and ambiguous a manner to Prussia, that he refused to enter\r\nthe ministry. Though he was greatly esteemed by the King, he was, after\r\na short time, induced to send back his general’s staff to his majesty.\r\nThe fact is that, when Austria and Prussia agreed to take up arms against\r\nthe revolutionary party in France, Herr von Schlieffen endeavoured to\r\nconvince the King of the danger and foolishness of such intervention.\r\nBut his honest efforts were in vain; the campaign against the Republic\r\nwas resolved on, and Herr von Schlieffen, who should have been one of\r\nthe first to march out, was left behind. He pressed the King either to\r\nalter this arrangement or allow him to retire, because he saw in it an\r\ninsulting slight. As neither the one course nor the other was taken\r\nhe resigned his posts, and retired to his estates. The King, however,\r\nremained well disposed towards him, and, some years subsequently,\r\nHerr von Schlieffen, in order to refute calumnies and envious Court\r\ntittle-tattle, felt himself called on once more to place himself at\r\nthe King’s disposal; as, however, it was not yet decided whether or no\r\nPrussia would take part in the projected campaign of 1794, the King, in\r\na gracious letter of thanks, declined his offer. Out of a feeling of\r\npatriotism, he had not accepted an invitation he received in the year\r\n1792 to join the French army as a general. At a subsequent period, when\r\nNapoleon’s star was in the ascendant, and the relations between France\r\nand Germany were becoming more threatening, Frederick William sought, it\r\nis true, to obtain once again the services of the holiday-keeping hero,\r\nbut the latter, assigning his age as an excuse, repressed his desire of\r\nreappearing as an actor upon the stage of glory and of honour. Who knows\r\nhow matters would have ended at Jena had all the other old generals of\r\nthe Prussian army then followed his example?\r\n\r\nHis career had brought him into contact with many princes and great\r\nmen, whose favour and friendship accompanied him into his seclusion.\r\nIn addition to the estate of Windhausen, he possessed a larger one,\r\nSchlieffenberg, in Mecklenburg, but he preferred residing in Hesse, under\r\nthe standard of which country he had served with honour for thirty-two\r\nyears. Thenceforth, a robust, vigorous, and cheerful old man, he lived\r\nin the lonely forest-residence he had built, devoting himself to his\r\nstudies, his friends, and his recollections.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the Treaty of Tilsit, a decree of Napoleon, in 1807, created\r\nthe Kingdom of Westphalia, the young King Jérôme Bonaparte offered the\r\nveteran, then seventy-five years old, a position equal to that he\r\nformerly held. But the splendour of the new Court did not tempt him, and\r\nhe preferred continuing his anchorite’s life, to which he had become\r\nattached, in Windhausen. He could not, however, as a landed proprietor\r\nand former member of the Hessian Chambers, avoid obeying the command for\r\nhim to take his place in the Westphalian Diet, summoned for occasional\r\ngay ceremonials and displays of magnificence, of little importance to the\r\nState and yielding no remuneration to its members. He was obliged, also,\r\nnow and then to attend the Court. But he refused to appear in any other\r\ncostume than his uniform as a Prussian general, and Jérôme, suppressing\r\nhis dissatisfaction, allowed him to do so. After the return of the\r\nElector, in the year 1813, Herr von Schlieffen speedily perceived that he\r\nwas in great disgrace with that prince. Some one had secretly told the\r\nlatter that, in the action with the Czarmitschen Cossacks, Schlieffen had\r\nassisted the usurper. In vain did the grey-haired general exert himself\r\nto confound this calumny. The Elector believed it, but perhaps only for\r\nthe purpose of having an excuse for another act of injustice of which he\r\nwas guilty. He ordered that the life annuity of one thousand thalers,\r\ngranted to Schlieffen by the Landgrave Frederick, and expressly confirmed\r\nby the Elector himself on his accession to the throne, should no longer\r\nbe paid. Moreover, Schlieffen was no more invited to Court.\r\n\r\nThough the events of the last few years had greatly diminished his\r\nincome, he would have got over the loss of the thousand thalers a year\r\nas easily as he consoled himself for that of Court favour. But the\r\nreckless injustice he perceived in such conduct grieved him profoundly\r\nand embittered the remainder of his days. He died, unmarried, at the age\r\nof ninety two, on the 15th September, 1825, and was buried in a small\r\nmausoleum which he had built long previously in the forest at Windhausen.\r\nThe inscriptions, also, are from his pen. On a tablet of red sandstone\r\nlet into the side looking towards the east are the following lines:—\r\n\r\n                              The Sepulchre\r\n                        Of the first Schlieffen,\r\n                   Possessor of yonder secluded Pile,\r\n   In whose calm retreat, and in the woods surrounding it with shade,\r\n   From the irksome Life of the Court, and the Troubles of the Warrior\r\n                            in time of Peace,\r\n                   Escaping as frequently as possible,\r\n                       He found, favoured by Fate,\r\n                   And guided perhaps by his opinions,\r\n                      More sweet than bitter Hours,\r\n            Thankful for the former, resigned to the latter,\r\n                       Tranquil as to the Future.\r\n\r\nOn the stone over the coffin in the interior of the mausoleum is the\r\nSchlieffen coat of arms and the annexed inscription:—\r\n\r\n                              Martin Ernst\r\n                             von Schlieffen,\r\n            formerly Lieutenant-General and Minister of State\r\n                       of the Landgrave of Hesse,\r\n              afterwards Royal Prussian Lieutenant-General\r\n                      and Governor of the Fortress\r\n                                of Wesel,\r\n        Knight of the Prussian Orders of the Black and Red Eagle,\r\n              And of the Hessian Orders of the Golden Lion,\r\n                              And of Merit.\r\n                      Born the 30th October, 1732,\r\n                       At Sudenzig, near Gallnow,\r\n                in Pomerania. Died the 15th Septb., 1825,\r\n                             at Windhausen.\r\n\r\nThis life of retirement at Windhausen was passed by the “refugee from\r\nthe world,” as he was fond of calling himself, in giving a park-like\r\ncharacter to, and ornamenting with various buildings, the two estates\r\npurchased with the money he had himself earned. This afforded him\r\nfrequent opportunities of being in the open air and indulging in\r\nexercises conducive to health. Once or twice a week he rode, followed\r\nby two servants, to Cassel, where he possessed in the Königsplatz, or\r\nKing’s Square, a house which he had built in the days of his grandeur.\r\nThe rest of his time was devoted to his friends, with whom he maintained\r\na correspondence; to his monkeys, whom he spoiled by petting; to his\r\nclassics, which he was never tired of reading; and to his _Memoirs_,\r\nwhich he continued from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe _Memoirs_, intended only for his relations, were published in\r\nthe year 1840, at Berlin, under the title, _Some Occurrences and\r\nExperiences in the Life of Martin Ernst von Schlieffen_. They contain\r\nvery interesting information relating to the history of his own times,\r\nespecially on account of the great number of letters printed in them.\r\nThey commence with a genealogy of the Von Schlieffen family. With\r\npedantic anxiety the author has avoided all foreign words. It was,\r\nin fact, a strange hobby of the “historian of his Sept,” as he also\r\nsometimes designated himself, never to employ a word borrowed from\r\nanother language, though he usually spoke French, and took a pleasure\r\nin arranging Latin and Greek proverbs and inscriptions for votive\r\ntablets, which he had hung up at his favourite spots at Windhausen\r\nand Schlieffenberg. In his old friend, Johannes von Müller, whom, as\r\nMinisterial Secretary of the young Kingdom of Westphalia, Fate brought\r\nback to Cassel in the year 1807, he found nothing to blame except that,\r\nin his immortal books, Müller would not entirely discard the horrible\r\nforeign words. But the comic part of the business was that in the\r\ninvention of German words, which Herr von Schlieffen employed in lieu\r\nof foreign ones generally in use, he was decidedly unfortunate, and to\r\nunderstand the words invented by him we must first have a key. This was\r\nsomething, however, which he felt himself, for, as a rule, he added the\r\nforeign word in a parenthesis. In addition to this he was noted for\r\ncertain turns or rather contortions of expression which considerable\r\nincreased the difficulty experienced by the uninitiated in understanding\r\nhis book, the value of which was, however, not nullified by these\r\neccentricities. But there was another caprice of the old gentleman,\r\nwhich annoyed, troubled, and plagued in the highest degree the inmates of\r\nWindhausen—that is to say, the entire establishment, from the bailiff and\r\ngamekeepers down to the dairymaid. This was his affection for his monkeys.\r\n\r\nThere was a large troop of these tailless, long-armed, brown foreigners\r\nat Windhausen, and “the general who has sought refuge from the woods”\r\nhad placed his whole estate unconditionally at their disposal. They ran\r\nabout as they chose, and contracted marriages among themselves, so that\r\nthe oldest speedily beheld, despite the unusual climate, a hopeful circle\r\nof healthy sons, daughters, and grandchildren assembled around them.\r\nThis circumstance was, however, observed by all the human population of\r\nthe estate, except the General, with dissatisfaction and uneasiness,\r\nfor scarcely a day passed that one person or another had not reason to\r\ncomplain of the monkeys. They were regarded as a public curse, and it\r\nneeded all the intensity of the affection, gratitude, and attachment\r\nfelt towards the old gentleman, for people not to weary of looking with\r\nindulgence on this fancy of his. The ill-behaved Africans did nothing\r\nbut mischief. They soiled the rooms, smashed plates and dishes, ruined\r\nthe gardens, waged war, frequently to their own great disadvantage, with\r\nthe beehives, and plucked the fruit from the trees, merely to throw it\r\naway as soon as they had tasted it, or fling it at the heads of those\r\npersons who might be passing by. No one who had to traverse the small\r\nwood ever escaped unmolested; the monkeys would hang on to the clothes of\r\none person, or frighten another by suddenly dashing across his path. All\r\nthis the worthy General considered exceedingly funny. Distinguished above\r\nall their companions, however, for slyness and a love for playing wild\r\npranks, were two large monkeys, Tommy and Troll.\r\n\r\nOne day a countryman came to Windhausen for the purpose of paying the\r\ninterest of a loan which the General had advanced him. The bailiff\r\nasked him to be seated, and, having had some breakfast brought in for\r\nhim, left the room for a short time, as he had just been called away to\r\nlook at some sick beast. The countryman, meanwhile, counted his money\r\nand drank a glass of the brandy of the country without the slightest\r\nmisgiving, when all of a sudden the door was opened gently, and in\r\nwalked Tommy. For some time he remained close to the door, staring the\r\nunknown visitor in the face. He then walked round the table at which the\r\ncountryman was seated, and finished by placing himself exactly in front\r\nof him, grinning and showing his teeth, with his left elbow leaning\r\non the table and his right one stuck in his side. The countryman was\r\nstruck dumb, and felt his hair stand on end with affright. There he sat,\r\nas though the terrible head of Medusa had thrown its spell over him.\r\nHis face, which had become the colour of lead from superstitious fear,\r\nappeared to amuse the brute not a little. At length Tommy had looked at\r\nthe countryman long enough; his sharp glance fell upon the bright thalers\r\non the table, and he was just stretching out his hand to appropriate\r\nsome, when something he considered still more desirable—namely, the\r\nbutter-dish—caught his eye. He took it, _sans façon_, off the table, and,\r\nseating himself on a cask near the stove, devoured the lump of butter,\r\nsmacking his lips the while. He then put back the empty dish. The return\r\nof the bailiff at last rescued the countryman from the state of fright in\r\nwhich he was.\r\n\r\n“Hulloa, my boy!” said the bailiff, laughing, and casting a glance at the\r\nempty dish, “you seem to have liked the butter at any rate!”\r\n\r\n“He did it, Mr. Bailiff!” groaned the countryman, nodding his head\r\ntimidly at Tommy, as though he feared being at least eaten up by the\r\nmonkey in consequence of this denunciation.\r\n\r\n“What! has the fat blackguard dared to do such a thing?” exclaimed the\r\nbailiff very angrily, and at the same time springing towards the window,\r\nin the embrasure of which was a riding-whip, “Wait a moment, I’ll pay\r\nyou out!”\r\n\r\nBut Tommy, who saw the storm approaching, was in such a hurry to escape\r\nfrom it, that at the door he nearly knocked over his comrade Troll,\r\nwho was coming in quite innocently. As the two monkeys were very like\r\neach other, and the bailiff had not, in his anger, remarked the lucky\r\nescape of the malefactor, he seized hold of old Troll by the throat, and\r\nbelieving he had caught the one who had stolen the butter, gave him an\r\nawful thrashing. During this time Tommy stood in the courtyard, wiping\r\nhis greasy mouth, and scratching himself, with a puzzled air, behind his\r\near, looking up as he did so at the bailiff’s window, through which the\r\nhowling of his innocent and unjustly-castigated brother found its way to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the monkeys managed to steal a roll of ducats out\r\nof their too indulgent master’s desk, which had been left open. They\r\nclimbed up with their spoil to the roof. Breaking the seal, they took out\r\na couple of coins, which were inspected on both sides with indescribable\r\ncuriosity by each monkey in succession. One of the coins accidentally\r\nfell out of the hand of the monkey who was holding it, and, rolling over\r\nthe roof, tumbled, with a sharp ringing sound, into the tin gutter, and\r\nthence into the pipe by which the rain-water was conveyed down the house.\r\nThis kind of music caused the monkeys such delight that they despatched\r\nall the remaining coins after the first one. While doing so they hung\r\nclose together on the pipe, and, with open ears, listened to the sound of\r\nthe descending ducats.\r\n\r\nBut a trick played by Troll might have been attended with more disastrous\r\nconsequences. The bailiff’s wife had left an infant, almost three years\r\nold, lying in the cradle while she was busy in the kitchen. Troll crept\r\nupstairs, and, opening the door of the room in which the cradle stood,\r\nobtained possession of the infant. He then ran off quickly with it. Some\r\nmaid-servants in the yard noticed him, but, instead of enticing him to\r\nthem, frightened him away by the fearful screams they uttered. At the\r\nend of the yard was a new building of wood, finished in the frame, up\r\nto the roof, and to this building Troll hurried off. Pressing the child\r\nclosely to his breast with one arm, and swinging himself from beam to\r\nbeam with the other, he clambered over the rafters of the roof, and\r\ntook his seat on the very ridge. The screams were really heartrending,\r\nand enough to deafen any one, when the unhappy mother came rushing out.\r\nWringing her hands in despair, she kept exclaiming—“Help! help! save my\r\npoor child!” All the inmates of the place came running to the spot, but\r\nthe men were, unfortunately, busy at work in the fields or in the wood,\r\nand represented only by the General’s French cook, Mons. Lebrun, whose\r\nreputation for courage and determination was not exactly the best. Troll,\r\nhowever, had selected him to become the hero of the day. Dressed in his\r\nneat white costume, with apron and cap, he sprang into the middle of the\r\ncrowd of wailing women, and cried out in a voice that would have become\r\na general in the din of battle—“Now you shall all be quite still, you\r\nunreasonable womans. You make wild se monkey. I vill obtain _tout seul\r\nvotre enfant_!” With these words he stretched out his arms, and drove\r\nback all the women into the passage of the gamekeeper’s house, the door\r\nof which was open. The mother was the only one he could not force from\r\nthe spot, so he assigned her a place whence, without being in the way,\r\nshe might witness his campaign, having first promised him, by the value\r\nshe set upon her infant’s life, to remain quiet. Meanwhile, unconcerned\r\nby what was going on below, the monkey was seated upon the ridge of the\r\nroof, with his back leaning against the fir-tree, which, according to the\r\nold custom, the carpenters had set up there the day previously on the\r\ncompletion of their labours. At one instant he pressed the child with\r\necstasy to his breast; at the next he rocked it on his lap. At length\r\nhe began untying and unrolling the long strip of flannel in which the\r\nchild was enveloped. The child, in happy ignorance of its danger, was\r\nperfectly still. Directly he had pacified and sent away the women, the\r\ncook began clambering up the ladder, and when he had reached the end of\r\nthat, climbing from one beam to another, up to the rafters of the roof.\r\nTroll ignored him altogether, though Mons. Lebrun coaxingly held out some\r\npreserves, for the purpose of prevailing on him to come down. In order to\r\nproperly appreciate the boldness of the undertaking, the reader must bear\r\nin mind that Mons. Lebrun had long ceased to be a youth, that he was very\r\npoorly, and not a practised climber. At last, in order to get quite near\r\nthe monkey, he was obliged to pursue his perilous course over the fragile\r\nlaths. Now for the first time did Troll appear to take any notice of him.\r\nHe half rose, cast an angry look at him, and, quickly grasping the child,\r\ntogether with the roll of flannel, now nearly half undone, prepared to\r\ndepart. “Ah, Monsieur Troll,” said the courageous cook coaxingly, “vhy\r\nyou not come down to your _dîner_? Take _un peu de biscuit_! Monsieur\r\nTroll is a vary good boy! Permeet that I see your _poupée_, Monsieur\r\nTroll. Geeve me your _poupée_, and I shall geeve you dis _confiture_!”\r\nThe above and similar persuasive arguments did the worthy man employ\r\nto prevail on the monkey to give up the infant. But Troll remained\r\nimmovable. The cook threw him a piece of biscuit. Troll did not even\r\nstretch out his hand after it. At length Mons. Lebrun approached so\r\nnear, that the women below uttered a half-suppressed shriek. He was now\r\ndeterred from seizing the monkey by the throat only by the thought that\r\nif he did so the monkey would instantly let the child fall. He had,\r\ntherefore, recourse once again to the sweetmeats, and held out a candied\r\nfig.\r\n\r\nFearful, probably, that it would take the same road as the biscuit,\r\nwhich he had allowed to fall, Troll made a snatch at it, intending to\r\nswallow it at once. The cook felt an immense weight removed from his\r\nbreast, for he knew that the monkey could not resist these sweets if\r\nhe once tasted them. Troll actually now moved a lath’s distance nearer;\r\nthe cook retired two laths’ distance, and held out a second fig. In this\r\nmanner did the monkey follow, lath by lath, and beam by beam, still\r\nholding the child closely, and immediately drawing back if the cook made\r\na movement to stretch out his hand towards it. At last he stood once\r\nmore upon the solid ground. “Move not from your place, madame,” he cried\r\nto the mother. “Move not from your place!” Still walking backwards, he\r\nenticed Troll over the yard into his room. After bolting the door, he\r\nthrew some sweetmeats into a white cotton nightcap, which he offered the\r\nmonkey. To draw the dainties out of the long cap it was necessary for\r\nTroll to employ two hands. Without taking long to consider, he gently\r\nand carefully laid down the child that had begun crying and kicking as\r\nhard as it could. At the same moment the cook clutched him vigorously by\r\nthe nape of the neck and flung him so violently into a dark room, that\r\nhe was greatly astonished to see the prisoner come out again alone, when\r\nthe General himself released him in the evening. An instant afterwards,\r\ndelighted at the success of his stratagem, the cook placed the child in\r\nthe arms of the weeping mother, and from that day forward no one ever\r\nagain dared to cast a doubt on the courage and determination of Monsieur\r\nLebrun.\r\n\r\nBut it was not always that the acts of the troublesome guests ended so\r\nwell, and the old gentleman, for whose sake people winked at a good\r\ndeal, because he was kind, benevolent, and charitable towards everybody,\r\nwas often exposed by his favourites to vexation. On some occasions they\r\nengaged in sanguinary strife with children and harmless pedestrians.\r\nHe paid liberally doctors’ bills and smart-money, when these were not\r\nrejected; but he did not conceal from himself the fact that, if such\r\ncases were often repeated, the authorities would take up the matter, and\r\ncompel him either to send the monkeys away or have them shut up. But he\r\nnever raised his stick against them; if they ever did anything more\r\nextravagant than usual he read them a lesson, and was always of opinion\r\nthat they understood this better than a beating. It is very certain,\r\ntoo, that they assumed a bearing and appearance as though crushed by\r\nremorse. They might, it is true, have pleaded as an excuse for many of\r\ntheir malicious tricks that they were always on the defensive, for, with\r\nthe exception of their master, every one in the place was their sworn\r\nfoe. They were beaten, inundated with cold and hot water, plagued and\r\nbaited in every possible manner by everybody who could do so unobserved.\r\nUnfortunately, the want of speech prevented them from formulating their\r\ncomplaints. Under these circumstances, all the affection and attachment\r\nof which their apish souls were capable they concentrated on their\r\nmaster, with whom they always found protection and indulgence. They\r\naccompanied him to the borders of the wood when he rode off, as was his\r\ncustom, to Cassel; while, in the evening, they looked out impatiently\r\nfrom the tops of the trees for him, and were perfectly mad with delight\r\nas soon as they perceived him, with his two tall servants, riding through\r\nthe corn-fields.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted for several years, and the monkeys excited\r\nthe attention of all the country round. Great and small made pilgrimages\r\nto Windhausen for the purpose of seeing these strangers, thus transported\r\nfifty or sixty degrees of latitude from their tropical home, till,\r\none fine morning, the whole thing was quite unexpectedly brought to a\r\nterrible termination.\r\n\r\nA young peasant girl was attacked by one of the strongest monkeys as she\r\nwas proceeding through the forest. Half dead with fear and loathing, she\r\nscreamed for help, but some time elapsed before the people ran up from\r\nthe farmyard. They found the girl lying on the ground, and engaged in a\r\ndesperate struggle with the animal, who had now become perfectly wild.\r\nHer long hair was dishevelled and partially torn from her head, while\r\nher face, neck, and hands were entirely covered with blood. The monkey\r\nwas in a state of uncontrollable fury, such as he had never been seen in\r\nbefore. The head ploughman, who courageously sprang forward and seized\r\nhim by the hair on the top of his head, was, in a few minutes, so bitten\r\nand scratched, that he could no longer see or hear. The noise attracted\r\nthe other monkeys, who were scattered about the forest, as well as all\r\nthe persons belonging to the farm, and who hastened up, armed with\r\ncudgels and flails. Among the first to reach the girl was the gamekeeper.\r\nHe no sooner perceived the magnitude of the danger than he hurried back\r\nto procure his double-barrelled gun. The courageous ploughman was still\r\nexposed to the furious attacks of the monkey, when a well-directed\r\nbullet, whizzing close past his ear, crushed the animal’s head. Now,\r\nhowever, followed a most strange and unexpected scene. Scarcely was the\r\nshot fired, and the bleeding body of their companion stretched writhing\r\non the ground, when all the monkeys, as if at a concerted signal, rushed\r\nwith a wild howl upon the persons present. A fearful conflict ensued,\r\nbut, through all the tumult, the bailiff’s voice was distinctly heard,\r\ncrying, “Kill all the devils! I will take the responsibility on myself,\r\nat the risk of losing my place!” It was an obstinate struggle; not a\r\nsingle combatant, man or monkey, made the slightest attempt to withdraw\r\nfrom the scene of action. It seemed as though long-cherished hate had\r\nsuddenly burst forth on both sides, to end in mutual destruction. But\r\nit was not long before the matter was decided. Before the expiration of\r\na quarter of an hour, five monkeys lay dead upon the ground, with their\r\nskulls shattered by bullets or blows from cudgels; about as many were\r\nrunning round on the down-trodden grass, with their backs flayed or\r\ntheir limbs broken. The rest were tied up and bound to trees. The lives\r\nof these last had been provisionally spared only in compliance with the\r\nearnest and warning persuasion of the gamekeeper. The victors, also,\r\nwere in an evil plight. The bailiff had lost the upper part of his left\r\near. One of the farm-servants was stretched on the ground by a blow\r\nintended for a monkey. He recovered, it is true, but remained, all his\r\nlife, hard of hearing. Nearly all, except the gamekeeper, had bleeding\r\nfaces and hands, and their clothes torn to rags. The girl was carried in\r\na swoon to the house, and given into the custody of the women. There was\r\nstill a troublesome piece of work left to be executed—namely, to place in\r\nsafe keeping the surviving monkeys, rendered more spiteful and malicious\r\nthan ever by their defeat. But this also was done. The dead, the wounded,\r\nand the living were flung together in one barn, and the door closed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the inmates of Windhausen assembled before the\r\ngamekeeper’s lodge to consult as to how the “confounded business” might\r\nbe communicated in the gentlest form to the General. The latter had\r\nset off, on horseback, an hour or two previously for Cassel, without\r\nany presentiment of the fate awaiting his favourites on that day.\r\nAlthough every person assured everybody else, for the purpose of mutual\r\nencouragement, that, under the circumstances, they could not have acted\r\ndifferently to what they had, yet everybody in that small assembly felt\r\nas though there was a hundredweight upon his breast. It was at length\r\nresolved that the gamekeeper, a faithful old servant, should undertake\r\nthe unthankful task of going to meet their master, and preparing him for\r\nwhat had happened. With a view to this a man was stationed as an outpost\r\nto bring information immediately the General was perceived approaching.\r\nIt was somewhere about five o’clock in the afternoon when the old\r\nsoldier, with his stereotyped attendants, the two lanky servants, came\r\nin sight. As usual when he returned from Cassel, he had his pockets full\r\nof sweetmeats for his monkeys. But what strangely oppressive feeling\r\noverpowered him more and more as he neared the wood? What, was not a\r\nsingle one of his merry brown rascals to be seen upon the branches? Why\r\ndid the spare form of the old gamekeeper, with his earth-coloured face\r\nand hang-dog look, stand there, as though rooted to the spot, like some\r\nwarning notice? He felt compelled to ease his mind by speaking.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, my old friend!” he cried to the gamekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Thank your honour, your excellency——”\r\n\r\n“My house is not burnt down, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency, you will pardon me——”\r\n\r\nThe strange and scared formality of the old man did not tend to put the\r\nGeneral at his ease. Still forcing himself to be jocular, he said—\r\n\r\n“I hope your old dame has not run off with any one?”\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper wished himself a thousand miles away. Once more he\r\nattempted to draw the well-conned speech from out of his confused memory,\r\nbut stuck fast at—\r\n\r\n“May it please your honour——”\r\n\r\n“Well!” exclaimed the General, impatiently, “what, in the name of\r\nfortune, has occurred? The house not burnt down, your wife not run away\r\nfrom you, and yet you are making a face as if you were going to be\r\nhanged! What other evil can possibly cross the path of two old fellows\r\nlike us?”\r\n\r\n“A great misfortune has happened, excellency!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s it. Then you would do well to tell it me without more ado.”\r\n\r\n“The monkeys, your honour——”\r\n\r\n“The monkeys,” repeated the General, as though electrified; “what is the\r\nmatter with the monkeys?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency, some of them have gone mad, and have terribly\r\nill-treated some of us; some have been killed, and the others made\r\nprisoners at the risk of our lives!”\r\n\r\nThe words “Gracious Heaven!” escaped like a groan from the breast of the\r\ngrey-haired soldier. He sank together as if one of the bonds which bound\r\nhim to life was snapped in twain. The fearful news had come upon him as\r\nthe lightning strikes the oak, and one of his tall servants hurried up to\r\nhold him in his saddle.\r\n\r\n“Gracious Heaven!” he repeated, and a long pause ensued.\r\n\r\n“They must all be shot,” continued the gamekeeper pitilessly, “or else\r\nthere will be murder.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious Heaven! Gracious Heaven!”\r\n\r\n“I am the only person who has come off with a whole skin,” pursued the\r\ngamekeeper, after a second and longer pause. “The bailiff has one of his\r\nears bitten off; Wagner’s daughter, from Oberkaufunger, is at death’s\r\ndoor, and the head ploughman no longer looks like a human being.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious Heaven!” ejaculated the General, and again the words were\r\nsucceeded by a long pause.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times the General rode a few paces into the wood, but as\r\noften turned back, quite undecided what to do. At length he plucked up\r\ncourage, rode up to the gamekeeper, down whose cheeks the hot tears were\r\nrolling, and, seizing his arm, said in a low, tremulous voice—\r\n\r\n“Shoot them all, old friend—shoot them all. That is the best course. But,\r\nmind, take good aim, and let me have half-an-hour to get away. Shoot them\r\nall, but not sooner!”\r\n\r\nWith these words he turned his horse, and trotted off in the direction of\r\nCassel, while the two lanky servants followed in angry mood.\r\n\r\nAfter the gamekeeper had stood a good five minutes as if rooted to the\r\nspot, shaking his head as he looked after his master, he dashed the\r\nbutt-end of his gun insolently on the ground, and said, half aloud—\r\n\r\n“May I be cursed if I would not give one of my hands to be able to run\r\nafter him, and say it was none of it true!”\r\n\r\n“Why, mate,” exclaimed the bailiff, who had been a secret witness from\r\nbehind the next bush of the whole scene, “what a strange fellow you are!\r\nIt must have ended so sooner or later. At present the blow has fallen;\r\nthe sorrow will pass away, and we have got rid of the confounded beasts.\r\nThink of all the annoyances which we, our wives, and our children have\r\nhad to bear on their account.”\r\n\r\n“He looked so happy as he came riding along.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” observed the other pressingly, “let us go and see what the\r\nwounded are doing.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he left the spot, dragging with him the gamekeeper, now grown\r\nso tender-hearted.\r\n\r\nIt was not till late in the evening that the General returned to\r\nWindhausen. For three days he was visible to no one. On the fourth day\r\nhe rode over, as was his wont, to Cassel, and, going to a sculptor’s,\r\nordered for his favourites a funeral monument, according to the design\r\nhe had himself made, and with the inscription he had himself drawn up.\r\nWhen completed the monument was erected over the common grave of all the\r\nmonkeys, on that bank of the quiet lake which was opposite the mansion,\r\nand where there is a magnificent south-western prospect. It consists of a\r\nsmooth, broken column, from seven to eight feet in height, placed upon a\r\nsquare pedestal, two feet in height. The inscription on the column is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                              In this Place\r\n        There returned to the great mass of the primitive matters\r\n               constituting Human Beings, Representatives\r\n         Of a Race of Africans, long naturalised in these Meads,\r\n                           After many Births.\r\n\r\n                              Not Slavery,\r\n             The Lot of their Fellow-Countrymen, the Blacks,\r\n                          But perfect Freedom,\r\n                       Was theirs, and the Result:\r\n                       Love for their Benefactor,\r\n                       Who unfortunately at last,\r\n         In consequence of their being attacked by a fit of fury\r\n                      As all were fighting for one,\r\n                       Was compelled to sacrifice\r\n                 His own pleasures to the general good.\r\n                        It was decreed that Death\r\n      Should strike Sires and Sons, Grandfathers and Grandchildren,\r\n                           Mothers and Babes.\r\n\r\n                     Men did not quite consider them\r\n            As belonging to the Species of their fellow-men.\r\n                           Them had Prometheus\r\n        Favoured with two extra hands; us with greater linguistic\r\n                              capabilities.\r\n      In Cunning, in the mixture of Goodness and malicious Tricks,\r\n                       And in forbidden Amusements\r\n     They appeared to be a Generation of Human Beings in the Skin of\r\n                                Monkeys.\r\n                                   And\r\n              The Power, which is so striking, of Instinct\r\n                Should counsel the ten-fingered Observer\r\n                     Indulgence towards his Fellows.\r\n\r\nThe “recluse escaped from the world” did not long survive his monkeys. He\r\nhad entailed all his estates, and, in default of nearer heirs, settled\r\nthem upon a collateral branch of his family, for which, previous to his\r\ndeath, he succeeded in obtaining the title of Count. None of his heirs,\r\nhowever, occupied his residence at Windhausen, and it has remained\r\ndeserted and shut up. Park, forest, and promenades have been suffered to\r\nrun wild, and the shady seats, with their magnificent views, extending\r\nthrough long arched avenues of green beech-trees, have been partially\r\ncovered with the grass and weeds that have overgrown them. But the quiet\r\nlake with the Monkeys’ monument, the gigantic trees, the grottoes and\r\nhermitages, the viaduct and the simple Mausoleum, overshadowed by oaks,\r\nall still exist, and are gradually becoming developed in the light mist\r\nwhich legends and traditions spread around the memorials of bygone times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR AND THE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR AND THE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED NATURAL (AND SUPERNATURAL) HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur title resembles that of a fable, but the story we are about to relate\r\nbears internal evidence of its truth.\r\n\r\nThe town of Weisstadt, in Germany, is full of philosophers,\r\nmathematicians, and _savants_ of all kinds. On entering the place, the\r\ntraveller is at once struck by the physiognomies of the inhabitants: all\r\nthe faces are more or less like geometrical figures.\r\n\r\nHerr Dummkopf, one of the innumerable professors who adorn Weisstadt,\r\nwas rich though learned; nevertheless, something was wanting to complete\r\nhis happiness. Every morning when he rose he addressed to himself\r\nthe following remark:—“Why did the traveller Bruce never discover\r\nthe peninsula of Meroë, which Herodotus saw as plainly as he saw the\r\nmoon?” This thought at last absorbed him so completely, that he could\r\nnot refrain from packing up his shirt and starting at once for Egypt.\r\nHe passed through France, crossed the Mediterranean without observing\r\nanything, so thoroughly occupied was he with the non-discovery of the\r\nsupposed peninsula. After remaining a few hours at Cairo, he pursued his\r\njourney to the ruins of Carnac. He bestowed a careless glance on the\r\nColossus of Memnon, the crypts of Osimandias, the obelisks of Luxor, and\r\nall the wonders of Egyptian Thebes; and as he continued to ascend the\r\nNile, he saw Latopolis, Elethyd, Apollinopolis, and Syene. The ruins of\r\nthese ancient towns were not honoured by a single mark of admiration: it\r\nwas humiliating for the Egypt of Sesostris!\r\n\r\nOne day the sun was so hot at noon—a very natural thing in the torrid\r\nzone—that the learned Dummkopf allowed himself to be seduced by the cool\r\naspect of the Nile, and determined to make an era in his scientific life\r\nby taking a bath in the sacred stream.\r\n\r\nHe looked around him. The desert was indeed worthy of its name. There\r\nwas not even a statue of Isis, of Ibis, of Anubis, or of Serapis to be\r\nseen. The Nile flowed on in religious silence, and Dummkopf, reassured\r\nby the solitude which reigned around, hastened to take off his boots and\r\nclothes, and after arranging them carefully on the bank, plunged into the\r\neternal river.\r\n\r\nDummkopf was grateful to Mother Nature for having placed a cool\r\nrefreshing stream by the side of a burning desert. As a boy he had\r\nbeen in the habit of swimming in the Rhine of his fatherland, and now\r\nremembering the accomplishments of his youth, he struck out, turned over,\r\nfloated on his back, dived, paddled like a dog, plunged like a porpoise,\r\nand again thanked Mother Nature for having, in her bountiful wisdom,\r\nplaced a cool refreshing stream by the side of a burning desert. He was\r\ncontinuing to disport himself like a freshwater Triton when suddenly,\r\nclose to him, and in the middle of the Nile, he saw a huge green snout,\r\nadorned with lion’s teeth, and lighted up with a pair of blood-red eyes.\r\n\r\nDummkopf instantly remembered that the Nile was fertile in crocodiles,\r\nand began to chide his memory for not having thought of that fact before.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the monster was bearing down on the imprudent bather,\r\nwho, though thin, by reason of excessive study, was at the same time a\r\nvery acceptable meal for a hungry crocodile.\r\n\r\nFor it was indeed a crocodile, and of the finest kind; a colossal and\r\namphibious lizard, more ferocious than the tiger of Bengal or the lion of\r\nthe Atlas.\r\n\r\nDummkopf made straight for a little island—the terror of navigators and\r\nthe salvation of swimmers. He had almost reached his place of refuge—with\r\nthe crocodile so close on his heels that he could feel its warm breath on\r\nthe soles of his feet—when he remembered that the monster was amphibious.\r\nAnother man would have been paralysed by this reflection. Not so\r\nDummkopf. He looked before him, and seeing a friendly palm-tree within\r\nreach—it was the solitary ornament of the little islet—he ran to it, took\r\na spring, and climbed up its branches with the agility of a squirrel.\r\n\r\nHaving perched himself in safety near the summit, the learned Professor\r\nlooked down upon the Nile. The crocodile was issuing slowly from the\r\nwater, shaking, as he did so, his coat of glittering scale-armour He then\r\nwalked along the sand like a fish that had suddenly become a quadruped,\r\nand gradually approached the foot of the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nDummkopf ransacked his memory for all he had ever read about crocodiles,\r\nwith the view of ascertaining whether Pliny or any other natural\r\nhistorian of celebrity had ever stated that they were able to climb up\r\npalm-trees.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him that both Pliny and Saavers had testified to the\r\nclimbing capabilities of the crocodile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Philosophy!” he mentally exclaimed, “grant that my brethren, who\r\nmake mistakes in every page, may also have erred on this point.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered with a shudder that he himself had written an\r\narticle in the _Weisstadt Review_ in which he maintained that crocodiles\r\nwere in the habit of climbing up trees like cats. He wished now that he\r\nhad thrown the article into the fire; but it was too late. All Weisstadt\r\nhad read it. It had even been translated into Arabian, and no author had\r\nyet contradicted it, although it had penetrated to Crocodilopolis itself.\r\n\r\nThe amphibious monster approached the palm-tree, looked up, and evinced\r\nthe most lively joy at discovering Dummkopf among the branches. It walked\r\nround and round, looked up again, and then, recognising the impossibility\r\nof taking the stronghold by assault, sat down, as if determined to reduce\r\nit by blockade.\r\n\r\nHere we must render homage to true science. Dummkopf, in spite of the\r\npreoccupation of the moment, was filled with regret when he found that,\r\ncontrary to what he had stated in the _Weisstadt Review_, crocodiles did\r\n_not_ climb trees. He saw that he had committed a gross error in Natural\r\nHistory, but he at the same time made up his mind never to correct it,\r\nif, by a miracle, he escaped from his present perilous position. He made\r\nthe statement with a full conviction of its truth, and it added one\r\nmore fact to Natural History. Crocodiles climbed up palm-trees. It was\r\nimpossible to deny it now, even after sitting on a palm-tree up which a\r\ncrocodile had been unable to climb. The conclusions of science must not\r\nrashly be interfered with.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the crocodile lay stretched out at the foot of the\r\npalm-tree, in calm anticipation of Dummkopf’s inevitable descent. From\r\ntime to time the animal testified, by the wagging of its tail, to the\r\npleasure it experienced in looking forward to that incident.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist, to do him justice, did not lose the opportunity of\r\nstudying the habits and manners of the Egyptian crocodile, but having\r\nreviewed the animal in a scientific spirit, he again trembled for his\r\nlife, for it was now evident that the blockade was to be kept up in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nHours of suspense and of imprisonment consist of 240 minutes each, but\r\nthey come to an end at last. Time sometimes goes on crutches, but it\r\nproceeds nevertheless. The sun went down as on the previous evening, and\r\nafter a very short period of dusk the last rays of departing daylight\r\nexhibited the crocodile lying at the foot of the palm-tree, placid and\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nThe Professor now searched in the storehouse of his memory for some\r\ninstance of a man who had passed the night on the top of a palm-tree.\r\nAfter going through the whole of ancient and modern history, he commenced\r\nthe department of travels, and suddenly bethought him of _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_, which, though not usually accepted as a book of travels, is\r\nfar more truthful than the great majority of works of that class. Now,\r\nRobinson Crusoe passed the first night after his shipwreck in a tree,\r\nand this tree was in all probability a palm-tree. “Why, then,” said Herr\r\nDummkopf, “should I not do the same?”\r\n\r\nAnd still fortifying himself with the example of Robinson Crusoe, the\r\nProfessor drew some of the smaller branches around him, and composed\r\nhimself to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the night was long, and Dummkopf slept but little. He dreamed that he\r\nwas at Weisstadt, delivering a lecture which proved that the crocodile\r\nwas a fabulous animal like the Sphinx, when suddenly a shower of\r\ncrocodile’s tears fell on his face. He awoke with a start, and was very\r\nnear falling down on to the tail of his besieger.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile was now, in all probability, fast asleep, and Dummkopf\r\nresolved to play him a trick. “If,” said the Professor, “I could slip\r\ndown the tree, and swim across the Nile without its hearing me, it would\r\nbe nicely caught when it awoke in the morning and found me gone.” But\r\nhaving reflected that he might be caught himself, he abandoned this\r\ndesperate project, and merely resolved not to go to sleep again that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhen day broke the Professor saw that the crocodile had not been idle\r\nduring the night. Instead of sleeping he had been fishing on the banks of\r\nthe Nile, and the bones with which the ground was strewed showed that he\r\nhad not fished in vain. The monster had now had his first course, and he\r\nlooked upwards towards his intended victim as if to say that he was quite\r\nready for the second.\r\n\r\nThe Professor had certainly a terrible future before him. The contest\r\nbetween the besieger and the besieged was by no means equal, for the\r\nformer could find as much food as he required in the waters of the\r\nadjacent Nile, while the latter saw no prospect of obtaining the\r\nslightest nourishment, and would in all probability either die from\r\nstarvation or fall fainting into the jaws of his voracious assailant.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Dummkopf’s stomach, a machine which in some respects\r\nis quite independent of the brain, began to murmur loudly, for it had\r\nbeen deprived of two meals—the supper of the previous evening and the\r\nmorning’s breakfast.\r\n\r\nAmong a great many other things of which the learned Professor was\r\nignorant, he did not know that palm-trees produced dates, a rich pulpy\r\nfruit on which the Arabs have contrived to live very well since the\r\ntime of Adam, the first colonist of Arabia. However, a short time after\r\nsunrise a ray chanced to fall upon a large bunch of these valuable\r\narticles of food, which the Professor at once recognised from having seen\r\nthem in the grocers’ shops of his fatherland. In Germany he had been in\r\nthe habit of breakfasting on beef and sausages, supported by several\r\nslices of bread, and washed down by several glasses of wine. But in the\r\ndesert he was obliged to content himself with whatever manna he could\r\nget, and to be thankful, moreover, that Providence had sent him any. He\r\nate dates by the handful, and felt much strengthened by his repast.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast a strange and superstitious idea occurred to the\r\nProfessor. He had read somewhere that crocodiles were the natural\r\navengers of all the insults offered to Egypt by barbarian travellers.\r\nIt appeared to him that there was some sense in this, for if crocodiles\r\ndidn’t serve to avenge something or other he was convinced they could\r\nserve no purpose at all. Then he reflected that he had passed without\r\nnotice the statue of Memnon, the colossal tenor who had just commenced\r\nhis morning cavatina under the influence of the sun’s rays. The divine\r\nOsimandias and the Pharaohs, as represented by the sublime pyramids, had\r\nbeen treated with similar disrespect; and the Professor now repented his\r\nirreverence, and vowed to kiss the big toe of Memnon, the tallest tenor\r\nin the world, if he only escaped his present danger.\r\n\r\nAfter this vow the illustrious Dummkopf became more tranquil. He looked\r\ndown at the crocodile, but the vow had produced no effect upon him.\r\nHe did not even seem to have heard it. There he was still, watching\r\npatiently for his prey.\r\n\r\nDummkopf was now dying for a mouthful of cold water. Dates possess the\r\nproperty of producing thirst. Hence they are very desirable at dessert if\r\nthe host wishes his guests to pass the bottle freely, but not otherwise.\r\nFor a professor at the top of a palm-tree from which he is unable to\r\ndescend, they form the most unsuitable food that can be conceived; but\r\nHerr Dummkopf had no choice—he had either to eat dates or to die of\r\ninanition. He was like Tantalus: the river was flowing at his feet, and\r\nhe was unable to get a drop of water wherewith to moisten his parched\r\nlips. He again compared his position with that of Robinson Crusoe, and\r\nfound that all the advantage was on the side of the latter. It was true\r\nRobinson Crusoe passed a night on a tree, but he came down the next\r\nmorning, killed parrots, made them into fricasseed fowl, drank rum and\r\nwater, walked about with an umbrella over his head, met no crocodiles,\r\nand found a man Friday. “Happy Robinson Crusoe!” exclaimed Dummkopf; “and\r\nyet he complained. I should like to know what he’d have done in my place,\r\non the top of a palm-tree.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky became overcast, and the Professor was filled with a\r\njoyful anticipation of rain. He had already joined his hands so as to\r\nform as large a receptacle as possible for the drops, and was promising\r\nhimself a regular aquatic orgie, when all at once he remembered that in\r\nEgypt it never rains.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile seemed to understand the sufferings of the Weisstadt\r\nTantalus. He walked to the edge of the river and swallowed several quarts\r\nof water, at the same time casting ironical glances at the unfortunate\r\nProfessor. The pleasantry of masters is always intolerable. Dummkopf was\r\ndisgusted and enraged; but this only increased his thirst.\r\n\r\nHe cast his eyes along the Nile, in hopes of discovering some\r\nprovidential sail. But then he remembered that in that part of the river,\r\nabove the rapids, there was scarcely a chance of meeting with a boat of\r\nany kind. A death-like solitude reigned around, and nothing was to be\r\nseen but dark ruins, among which an occasional ibis, motionless, like a\r\nmark of admiration, was perched.\r\n\r\nAgain the Professor turned his thoughts towards Robinson Crusoe.\r\n“Certainly,” he said to himself, “if Crusoe had been in my position, at\r\nthe top of a palm-tree, he would somehow or other have found means to\r\nobtain a drop of water. Come now, how would he have done it?”\r\n\r\nDummkopf’s mouth was on fire, and there was the great Nile rolling calmly\r\nand majestically before him.\r\n\r\nAt last Necessity, who is known to be the mother of Invention, brought\r\nher ingenious child to his aid.\r\n\r\nThe Professor clapped his hands. He had discovered an hydraulic process\r\nwhich would enable him to appease his thirst. How little is required to\r\ngive joy to poor humankind! Here is a man on a palm-tree—a dying man who\r\ncannot escape from the jaws of a crocodile—and because he has discovered\r\na very equivocal means of obtaining a few drops of brackish water with\r\nwhich to moisten his parched lips, he is convulsed with delight.\r\n\r\nDummkopf was proud of competing with Defoe’s hero, and set to work\r\nwithout delay. He began by breaking off from his palm-tree several long\r\nbranches, which he spliced together by means of fibres. He then waited\r\nuntil the crocodile entered the water for a few minutes—by way of keeping\r\nup its character as an amphibious animal—and extended his apparatus\r\ntowards the river. The leaves at the extremity of the machine imbibed\r\na considerable quantity of water, and the Professor, drawing back his\r\nimprovised pump, refreshed his calcined lips by means of the saturated\r\nfoliage. He repeated the experiment several times, and, in fact, gave\r\nhimself up to all the excesses of intemperance. This was an ingenious\r\ndevice, for which Tantalus would have given his eyes!\r\n\r\nBut, above all, Dummkopf was amused at the notion of mystifying his\r\ncrocodile, who, as for that, richly deserved it.\r\n\r\nHaving no longer any anxiety as to the means of satisfying the two chief\r\nwants of existence—hunger and thirst—the Professor now began to think how\r\nhe should manage for his clothes. His aboriginal costume was admirably\r\nsuited to a tropical climate during the day, but remembering that during\r\nthe night he had felt rather chilly, he resolved to make himself without\r\ndelay a garment of green leaves. Besides, how was he to appear before the\r\npublic without clothes, if by chance a boat should present itself?\r\n\r\nDummkopf accordingly gathered in his aërial alcove a certain quantity of\r\nthe largest leaves he could find, and crossing his legs like a tailor,\r\nproceeded to make them into a vegetable paletôt, which could not be said\r\nto belong to the latest fashion, but which, on the other hand, had a\r\nprimitive cut about it that was highly picturesque. Two leaves sufficed\r\nfor the nightcap, which, original or not as its appearance may have been,\r\nat all events looked much better than the hats we wear in open day.\r\n\r\nHere was Dummkopf now lodged, fed, and clothed at the expense of Nature.\r\nHappiness is altogether relative; and, for a time, Dummkopf was happy\r\nindeed. He was proud of his inventions, and from the height of his\r\npalm-tree looked down upon Robinson Crusoe with contempt.\r\n\r\nAs he was reflecting calmly on his happiness he saw the monster, no\r\nlonger horizontal, at the foot of the tree. He was making one last\r\nendeavour to take it by storm, but failing in the attempt had forthwith\r\nrecourse to sapping and mining. He went to work with the air of a\r\ncrocodile who had made up his mind, and who had said to himself, “There\r\nmust be an end to this.”\r\n\r\nDummkopf shuddered as he heard the teeth of the monster grinding against\r\nthe bark of the tree.\r\n\r\nBut the molars and incisors of the crocodile are so arranged that they\r\ncan do no serious harm to the palm-tree; they can tear the bark off, but\r\ncannot pierce or crush the trunk. Dummkopf, however, was ignorant of this\r\nfact, and expected every minute that his asylum would fall to the ground,\r\nand leave him a prey to the horrid monster into whose scaly body he would\r\nenter as into a tomb of shell, but without the smallest epitaph to inform\r\nthe world of the numerous virtues he possessed.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile next attacked the tree with his tail as with a\r\nbattering-ram. How the Professor quivered when the tree shook! And the\r\nworst of it was, that, independently of the most terrible result that\r\ncould possibly take place, there was the certainty that the Professor\r\nwould lose a large portion if not the whole of his provisions, unless the\r\nmonster desisted from his sanguinary assault; for with each blow from the\r\ncrocodile’s tail down came a bunch of dates, and when, as often happened,\r\nthe fruit fell on the animal’s back, his fury redoubled.\r\n\r\nAt last Dummkopf could stand it no longer. Convinced that life was not\r\nworth defending at such a cost, he resolved to throw himself from the\r\ntop of the palm-tree in order to find repose in death. Full of this\r\ndesperate idea he stood up, put aside the branches which might have kept\r\nhim back at the edge of the precipice, and thrusting one foot resolutely\r\nforward kept the other firmly in its place. An honourable thought checked\r\nhim on the very brink of the abyss. Dummkopf had no family, no wife, no\r\nchildren, no nephews; it was his duty then to remain in the world as the\r\nsole representative of the Dummkopfs. Man is ingenious, even in the midst\r\nof his despair. If he has a wife and children, he wants to live for their\r\nsake; if he is alone in the world, he will live for his own benefit.\r\n\r\nDummkopf was very grateful to himself after coming to this heroic\r\nresolution. He even called himself a coward for having entertained for an\r\ninstant the idea of offering himself up as a sacrifice to the voracity of\r\nan amphibious monster.\r\n\r\nAs he was now determined not to die if he could by any means avoid it,\r\nthe Professor began to consider whether it would be possible to enjoy,\r\nat the top of his palm-tree, that sort of happiness which a civilised\r\nman has a right to expect. The crocodile had expended all his force in\r\nvain. It was evident that the palm-tree was an impregnable fortress as\r\nfar as his attacks were concerned. The climate was superb. At the foot\r\nof the house—that is to say, of the palm-tree—ran a magnificent river.\r\nThanks to the hydraulic apparatus there could never be any want of water;\r\nand as for food, there were dates in abundance. The crocodile instead\r\nof being terrible was now only amusing, and as it was clearly proved\r\nthat the palm-tree could suffer no injury from the monster’s wrath, the\r\nProfessor, in his lively moments, sometimes went so far as to pelt him\r\nwith date-stones.\r\n\r\nEvery morning when the sun rose, Dummkopf bent his ear towards the desert\r\nand listened to the cavatina of Memnon, the colossal tenor. Then after\r\nbreakfast, if he was pleased with the crocodile, he threw him down a few\r\nrotten dates, and was amused to see how voraciously the monster devoured\r\nthem. Between breakfast and dinner he read in the library of his memory,\r\nand studied the mysterious monuments by which he was surrounded. When a\r\nprofound thought occurred to him, he took a stylus, formed out of a twig,\r\nand jotted it down on a leaf which served as papyrus. Then he read it\r\nover several times, and put it away in a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThere were no neighbours to watch his conduct, no journals to criticise\r\nhis thoughts, no tax-gatherers to trouble him about overdue rates. He was\r\nas free as the air, and only wondered why the misanthropes of society did\r\nnot imitate Simon Stylites or himself, and retire for the rest of their\r\nlives to the top of some column or palm-tree.\r\n\r\nWe must now leave our anchorite in his palm-tree, and proceed to the\r\nopposite bank of the Nile, where Herr von Thorigkeit, the celebrated\r\nbotanist of Berlin, was engaged in a hopeless search after yellow\r\nlotuses. Herodotus, it is true, saw yellow lotuses, but then Herodotus\r\npossessed the peculiarity of seeing things that did not exist. At all\r\nevents, since his time the yellow lotus has not been met with, and for\r\nthat reason conscientious botanists are perpetually looking for it.\r\n\r\nHerr von Thorigkeit, then, was searching for the yellow lotus, and he was\r\naccompanied by two Arabs armed with carbines.\r\n\r\nThere are some things, ordinary enough in themselves, which have an\r\noverpowering effect on the imagination when they are seen in the\r\ndesert. What, for instance, would be the feelings of a traveller who\r\nshould discover in the midst of the Sahara a neat little house with\r\nthe words—“Reading room, admission one penny,” over the entrance? Von\r\nThorigkeit was behaving naturally enough when he uttered a cry of dismay\r\nwhich resounded along the left bank of the Nile.\r\n\r\nHe had seen two boots, one proud and erect, the other bent down as if\r\nwith fatigue. Dummkopf’s clothes had disappeared, carried away by the\r\nstream, or perhaps swallowed by some omnivorous crocodile, but there\r\nwere the boots standing on a ledge of rock.\r\n\r\nThe legitimate dismay of the botanist will now be understood. He had seen\r\ntwo boots on the left bank of the Nile: one proud and erect, the other\r\nbent down as if with fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe faithful Arabs, who had never seen a pair of boots in their lives,\r\nbecame terrified with the terror of the botanist, and bravely fired at\r\nthe wellingtons, which fell riddled with balls.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of his palm-tree the Professor heard the report, and at\r\nfirst felt inclined to curse the troublesome individual who had come to\r\ndisturb him in his solitude and meditation. But human weakness at last\r\ngained the day, and he resolved to make signals of distress to the three\r\nmen whom he now perceived on the left bank of the Nile.\r\n\r\nHe broke off a long branch from the palm-tree, stripped it of its leaves\r\neverywhere but at the end, where he left a large tuft, and waved it\r\nvigorously above his head with one hand, while with the other he threw\r\ninto the Nile a quantity of dates, the only projectiles at his command.\r\n\r\nThe botanist, who was surrounded by that silence which is known to\r\naëronauts alone, turned round at the sound of the dates falling into\r\nthe water, and this time experienced a surprise which was greater even\r\nthan the former one. The apparition of the boots was forgotten: he saw a\r\npalm-tree with a lofty crest, which waved to and fro in the midst of a\r\nperfectly calm atmosphere! After the first shock, this discovery caused\r\nhim infinite delight, and he would have given all the yellow lotuses in\r\nthe world for this phenomenon of a palm-tree.\r\n\r\nVon Thorigkeit opened his note-book and wrote in it the following lines:\r\n“In Upper Egypt there exists a kind of palm-tree, which possesses the\r\npeculiarities of the aloe; with this difference, however, that the stem\r\nof the aloe attains an elevation of twenty feet above the level of\r\nthe soil, and remains motionless, while the palm-tree of Upper Egypt\r\nagitates the top of its stem vertically and with a movement of prodigious\r\nregularity. We have named this tree the Von Thorigkeit palm.”\r\n\r\nHaving written this, the botanist made a sketch of the palm-tree and\r\nshowed it to the two Arabs, having no other public to exhibit it to. The\r\nchildren of the desert, with their lynx-like eyes, had just discovered a\r\nhuman form beneath the thick foliage of the island palm-tree, and they\r\nresorted to the most energetic gestures in order to make the botanist see\r\nit too. But Von Thorigkeit could think of nothing but the grandeur of\r\nhis discovery and the beauty of his drawing. He paid no attention to the\r\ngestures of the Arabs, and thought only of the sensation that would be\r\nproduced in the learned world by the Von Thorigkeit palm.\r\n\r\nThe two Arabs persisted in their pantomime, which said as plainly as\r\npossible: “Look there on that little island; there is a human being there\r\nup in the palm-tree; he is in danger; he is making signals, and we must\r\ngo to his aid at once.”\r\n\r\nVon Thorigkeit pulled out a pocket telescope, shrugging his shoulders at\r\nthe same time with the air of a man who makes a concession merely from\r\npoliteness, and looked carelessly towards the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree.\r\nHe had now his third surprise within the hour—the last completely\r\nabsorbing the two others. He had seen distinctly a human face, and even\r\na German face, surrounded by leaves; and a human hand shaking a naked\r\nbranch with a tuft of foliage at the end. He replaced his telescope in\r\nhis pocket with regret, read his article again, cast another glance at\r\nhis drawing, and after reflecting, like Brutus, whether he should destroy\r\nhis two children or let them live, decided at length upon the latter\r\ncourse. “Well, so much the worse,” he said to himself: “what is written\r\nis written, and I shall not cut out a single word. Besides, as the aloe\r\nexists the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree might have existed, if Nature had\r\nonly seen its utility; I see its utility, and I shall let it remain.”\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been taken, the three men held a council. The\r\nfirst thing to do was to find a boat, which, after two hours’ walking,\r\nthey met with. It was a fishing vessel, and the botanist had only to\r\nhold out a piece of gold and to point to the river in order to make the\r\nfisherman understand what was required of him. He then pointed down the\r\nstream, and said, in a haughty voice, as if the fisherman was likely to\r\nunderstand him—\r\n\r\n“The island of the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree!”\r\n\r\nThe pantomimic direction would have sufficed.\r\n\r\nThey descended the Nile. The island of the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree was\r\nsoon visible; and, as they approached it, the Arabs, with their lynx-like\r\neyes, manifested some uneasiness, and exchanged signs of intelligence.\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour’s rowing, doubt was no longer possible. They\r\nhad really seen an enormous crocodile keeping watch beneath the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nThey imparted their discovery to the botanist, who now received his\r\nfourth surprise in the course of the day, and trembled with cold in a\r\ntemperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. However, for the honour of his\r\nfatherland, the learned German endeavoured to conceal his alarm, which,\r\nit must be admitted, was natural enough on the part of a botanist, who\r\nwas accustomed only to hunt for flowers, and who had nothing whatever to\r\nsay to the amphibious monsters of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were talking quietly among themselves, like men accustomed to\r\nhunt crocodiles. They put fresh caps on the nipples of their guns, stood\r\nup firmly in the fore part of the boat, and told the fisherman to be\r\ncareful with his oars.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile saw the boat approaching, but did not know whether it\r\nbrought prey or peril to his shore. In the meanwhile he made ready either\r\nfor defence or flight, according to the number and importance of the\r\ninvaders. He lay stretched out at the edge of the river, as motionless\r\nas a crocodile in a museum; but he kept his mouth wide open, ready to\r\nswallow the first enemy who landed.\r\n\r\nThe two Arabs, who were thoroughly acquainted with the habits and\r\nmanners of the animal, took aim, uttered a syllable at the same moment,\r\nand their two shots sounded as one. The bullets entered, at the only\r\nvulnerable spot, the open mouth, and went through the whole length of the\r\ncrocodile’s body.\r\n\r\nThe monster shook his head with contortions so comic, that they called\r\nforth shouts of laughter from the first floor of the palm-tree. Then,\r\ncasting forth a torrent of blood upon the sand, he closed his tearful\r\neyes and moved no more.\r\n\r\nDummkopf arranged his vegetable costume the best way he could, looked\r\nfor his gloves merely through habit, and not finding them, came down\r\nas he was. The Arabs, like all their race, were grave men, but their\r\nseriousness disappeared in the wildest laughter when they saw Dummkopf’s\r\ncostume. The botanist himself, now reassured by the death of the\r\ncrocodile, could scarcely restrain his hilarity; but he bit his lips, and\r\nafter shaking hands with his fellow-countryman, begged him to communicate\r\nhis adventures. Dummkopf commenced by requesting his learned friend to\r\ncheck the unbecoming mirth of the Arabs, who were threatened with the\r\nvengeance of the Prussian consul in case they did not instantly desist.\r\n\r\nThen Von Thorigkeit in the most generous manner offered Dummkopf his\r\npaletôt, which Dummkopf naturally accepted, retiring for some minutes\r\nbehind the palm-tree in order to change his clothes, as he expressed it,\r\nthough he might have said to dress himself.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a solemn farewell of his palm-tree, Dummkopf got into\r\nthe boat, taking with him the crocodile and the coat of leaves as\r\nreminiscences of his adventures, and also as corroborative proofs. These\r\nprecious relics were destined for the “Neue Museum” at Berlin, and Herr\r\nvon Thorigkeit, who was attached to the Berlin University, hastened to\r\nthank Herr Dummkopf in the name of the Prussian capital.\r\n\r\nDummkopf was equally courteous to the worthy botanist. He thanked him in\r\nthe name of science for his discovery of the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree,\r\nwhich added another member to the already numerous family of palms. He\r\neven promised to write a notice in the _Weisstadt Review_, to prove that\r\nthe palm-tree just discovered through the indefatigable zeal of Von\r\nThorigkeit belonged to the same species as the aloe of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nAt the nearest village a complete Arab costume was procured for Dummkopf,\r\nwho, with the honesty which always distinguishes true science, restored\r\nthe paletôt to Von Thorigkeit.\r\n\r\nThe two friends returned to Germany together, and soon afterwards an\r\narticle signed Dummkopf appeared in the _Weisstadt Review_, in which full\r\njustice was done to the labours of the intrepid botanist and traveller,\r\nVon Thorigkeit, who had discovered the Von Thorigkeit palm-tree at the\r\nrisk of his life, and not until he had killed two black reptiles of the\r\ncobra capella species. The article was illustrated with a wood-cut, which\r\nrepresented the new tree agitating its tuft in the air.\r\n\r\nVon Thorigkeit also did his duty, for as soon as he reached Berlin he\r\nmade known to the world that Herr Dummkopf, who had ventured above the\r\nthird cataract, had rectified the errors of all the previous maps, and\r\nthat in the course of his expedition he had killed two crocodiles by\r\nmeans of electricity.\r\n\r\nThose who have meditated on the nature of man will not be astonished to\r\nhear the end of this true story. Dummkopf is at present the proprietor of\r\nthe _Weisstadt Review_. He is a lecturer in the Weisstadt University, and\r\nin addition to all this, he has a wife and six children. Well, in spite\r\nof the Review, in spite of the lectureship, in spite even of his wife\r\nand six children, Dummkopf, at certain moments, regrets the peaceful life\r\nhe led in his aërial apartment at the top of the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nSuch is man! a being full of contradictions!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE LIFE IN GENERAL, AND MONKEYS IN PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE LIFE IN GENERAL, AND MONKEYS IN PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world has scarcely seen a worthier traveller or better naturalist\r\nthan Charles Waterton. In an eminent degree he possessed the qualities\r\nessential to the study of the animal world. A good eye, a sympathy with\r\nmoving nature, untiring patience, and a contempt for the comfortable and\r\nluxurious things of the earth—endued with these qualities, he had the\r\nnecessary parts of a man who was sure to observe and note the admirable\r\nworks of the Creator. His “Wanderings” in North and South America contain\r\noriginal descriptions of the objects to be seen in that magnificent\r\ncontinent, which have never been surpassed for their clearness and\r\ndistinctness. In this volume we shall only refer to a few of his notes,\r\nwhich have more particular reference to those animals whose lives, like\r\nthe monkeys, are spent more or less in the branches or under the leaves\r\nof the sheltering trees, the monarchs of the stupendous forests. Of\r\nGuiana he writes that four-footed animals are scarce there, considering\r\nhow very thinly the forests are inhabited by man. The leopard, who is\r\nvery much in the trees, and is called there a tiger, is found, and so\r\nare tiger-cats, fiercest and cruellest of all the feline race. The red\r\nmonkey, erroneously called the baboon, is heard there oftener than he is\r\nseen; while the common brown monkey, the bisa, and sacawinki rove from\r\ntree to tree and amuse the stranger as he journeys. In the trees, too,\r\nyou will see the polecat, the opossum, and now and then you will find a\r\nporcupine on a branch above your head. To some readers the famous story\r\nof the Coon may not be known, so we will tell it. An American colonel\r\nhad become very famous for his skill in shooting the opossum, and it was\r\nsaid that the knowledge of his prowess had extended even to the animals\r\nhe shot so well. It is very difficult for a novice to shoot opossum,\r\nbecause they lie upon the branch so closely to it, that it is with great\r\ndifficulty an unpractised observer can see the animal. Nevertheless, the\r\nmarksman became so known to the coons, as opossum are vulgarly called,\r\nthat they gave themselves up as lost directly they espied him on their\r\ntrail. “Is that you, colonel?” “Yes,” would reply the great shot. “Then\r\nI’ll come down,” rejoined the coon, who thought it more prudent to be\r\ntaken captive and have a chance hereafter of escape, than to be shot\r\nthere and then to death by the unerring tube of the colonel’s rifle.\r\n\r\nNow listen to Mr. Waterton, as he describes that extraordinary animal,\r\nthe sloth:—\r\n\r\n“This, too, is the native country of the sloth. His looks, his gestures,\r\nand his cries, all conspire to entreat you to take pity on him. These\r\nare the only weapons of defence which nature hath given him. While other\r\nanimals assemble in herds, or in pairs range through these boundless\r\nwilds, the sloth is solitary, and almost stationary; he cannot escape\r\nfrom you. It is said, his piteous moans make the tiger relent, and turn\r\nout of the way. Do not, then, level your gun at him, or pierce him with\r\na poisoned arrow; he has never hurt one living creature. A few leaves,\r\nand those of the commonest and coarsest kind, are all he asks for\r\nhis support. On comparing him with other animals, you would say that\r\nyou could perceive deficiency, deformity, and superabundance in his\r\ncomposition. He has no cutting teeth, and, though four stomachs, he\r\nstill wants the long intestines of ruminating animals. He has only one\r\ninferior aperture, as in birds. He has no soles to his feet, nor has he\r\nthe power of moving his toes separately. His hair is flat, and puts you\r\nin mind of grass withered by the wintry blast. His legs are too short;\r\nthey appear deformed by the manner in which they are joined to the body;\r\nand when he is on the ground, they seem as if only calculated to be used\r\nin climbing trees. He has forty-six ribs, while the elephant has only\r\nforty; and his claws are disproportionately long. Were you to mark down,\r\nupon a graduated scale, the different claims to superiority amongst the\r\nfour-footed animals, this poor ill-formed creature’s claim would be last\r\nupon the lowest degree. His native haunts have hitherto been little\r\nknown, and probably little looked into. Those who have written on this\r\nsingular animal have remarked that he is in a perpetual state of pain,\r\nthat he is proverbially slow in his movements, that he is a prisoner in\r\nspace, and that as soon as he has consumed all the leaves of the tree\r\nupon which he had mounted, he rolls himself up in the form of a ball, and\r\nthen falls to the ground. This is not the case.\r\n\r\n“If the naturalists who have written the history of the sloth had gone\r\ninto the wilds, in order to examine his haunts and economy, they would\r\nnot have drawn the foregoing conclusions; they would have learned, that\r\nthough all other quadrupeds may be described while resting on the ground,\r\nthe sloth is an exception to this rule, and that his history must be\r\nwritten while he is in the tree.\r\n\r\n“This singular animal is destined by nature to be produced, to live,\r\nand to die in the trees; and to do justice to him, naturalists must\r\nexamine him in this his upper element. He is a scarce and solitary\r\nanimal, and being good food, he is never allowed to escape. He inhabits\r\nremote and gloomy forests, where snakes take up their abode, and where\r\ncruelly-stinging ants and scorpions, and swamps, and innumerable thorny\r\nshrubs and bushes, obstruct the steps of civilised man. Were you to draw\r\nyour own conclusions from the descriptions which have been given of the\r\nsloth, you would probably suspect that no naturalist has actually gone\r\ninto the wilds with the fixed determination to find him out and examine\r\nhis haunts, and see whether nature has committed any blunder in the\r\nformation of this extraordinary creature, which appears to us so forlorn\r\nand miserable, so ill put together, and so totally unfit to enjoy the\r\nblessings which have been so bountifully given to the rest of animated\r\nnature; for, as it has formerly been remarked, he has no soles to his\r\nfeet, and he is evidently ill at ease when he tries to move on the\r\nground, and it is then that he looks up in your face with a countenance\r\nthat says, ‘Have pity on me, for I am in pain and sorrow.’\r\n\r\n“It mostly happens that Indians and negroes are the people who catch the\r\nsloth, and bring it to the white man: hence it may be conjectured that\r\nthe erroneous accounts we have hitherto had of the sloth have not been\r\npenned down with the slightest intention to mislead the reader, or give\r\nhim an exaggerated history, but that these errors have naturally arisen\r\nby examining the sloth in those places where nature never intended that\r\nhe should be exhibited.\r\n\r\n“However, we are now in his own domain. Man but little frequents these\r\nthick and noble forests, which extend far and wide on every side of us.\r\nThis, then, is the proper place to go in quest of the sloth. We will\r\nfirst take a near view of him. By obtaining a knowledge of his anatomy,\r\nwe shall be enabled to account for his movements hereafter, when we see\r\nhim in his proper haunts. His fore-legs, or, more correctly speaking, his\r\narms, are apparently much too long, while his hind-legs are very short,\r\nand look as if they could be bent almost to the shape of a corkscrew.\r\nBoth the fore and hind-legs, by their form, and by the manner in which\r\nthey are joined to the body, are quite incapacitated from acting in a\r\nperpendicular direction, or in supporting it on the earth as the bodies\r\nof other quadrupeds are supported, by their legs. Hence, when you place\r\nhim on the floor, his belly touches the ground. Now, granted that he\r\nsupported himself on his legs like other animals, nevertheless he would\r\nbe in pain, for he has no soles to his feet, and his claws are very sharp\r\nand long, and curved; so that, were his body supported by his feet, it\r\nwould be by their extremities, just as your body would be, were you to\r\nthrow yourself on all fours, and try to support it on the ends of your\r\ntoes and fingers—a trying position. Were the floor of glass, or of a\r\npolished surface, the sloth would actually be quite stationary; but as\r\nthe ground is generally rough, with little protuberances upon it, such\r\nas stones, or roots of grass, &c., this just suits the sloth, and he\r\nmoves his fore-legs in all directions, in order to find something to lay\r\nhold of; and when he has succeeded he pulls himself forward, and is thus\r\nenabled to travel onwards, but at the same time in so tardy and awkward a\r\nmanner as to acquire him the name of sloth.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, his looks and his gestures evidently betray his uncomfortable\r\nsituation; and as a sigh every now and then escapes him, we may be\r\nentitled to conclude that he is actually in pain.\r\n\r\n“Some years ago I kept a sloth in my room for several months. I often\r\ntook him out of the house and placed him upon the ground, in order to\r\nhave an opportunity of observing his motions. If the ground were rough,\r\nhe would pull himself forwards, by means of his fore-legs, at a pretty\r\ngood pace; and he invariably immediately shaped his course to the nearest\r\ntree; but if I put him on a smooth and well-trodden part of the road, he\r\nappeared to be in trouble and distress. His favourite abode was the back\r\nof a chair; and after getting all his legs in a line upon the topmost\r\npart of it, he would hang there for hours together, and often, with a low\r\nand inward cry, would seem to invite me to take notice of him.\r\n\r\n“The sloth, in its wild state, spends its whole life in trees, and never\r\nleaves them but through force, or by accident. An all-ruling Providence\r\nhas ordered man to tread on the surface of the earth, the eagle to soar\r\nin the expanse of the skies, and the monkey and squirrel to inhabit the\r\ntrees: still these may change their relative situations without feeling\r\nmuch inconvenience; but the sloth is doomed to spend his whole life in\r\nthe trees; and what is more extraordinary, not _upon_ the branches, like\r\nthe squirrel and the monkey, but _under_ them. He moves suspended from\r\nthe branch, he rests suspended from it, and he sleeps suspended from it.\r\nTo enable him to do this, he must have a very different formation from\r\nthat of any other known quadruped.\r\n\r\n“Hence his seemingly bungled conformation is at once accounted for; and\r\nin lieu of the sloth leading a painful life, and entailing a melancholy\r\nand miserable existence on its progeny, it is but fair to surmise that it\r\njust enjoys life as much as any other animal, and that its extraordinary\r\nformation and singular habits are but further proofs to engage us to\r\nadmire the wonderful works of Omnipotence.\r\n\r\n“It must be observed that the sloth does not hang head downwards like the\r\nvampire. When asleep he supports himself from a branch parallel to the\r\nearth. He first seizes the branch with one arm, and then with the other;\r\nand after that, brings up both his legs, one by one, to the same branch,\r\nso that all four are in a line: he seems perfectly at rest in this\r\nposition. Now, had he a tail, he would be at a loss to know what to do\r\nwith it in this position: were he to draw it up within his legs, it would\r\ninterfere with them; and were he to let it hang down, it would become the\r\nsport of the winds. Thus his deficiency of tail is a benefit to him; it\r\nis merely an apology for a tail, scarcely exceeding an inch and a half in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n“I observed, when he was climbing, that he never used his arms both\r\ntogether, but first one and then the other, and so on alternately. There\r\nis a singularity in his hair, different from that of all other animals,\r\nand, I believe, hitherto unnoticed by naturalists; his hair is thick\r\nand coarse at the extremity, and gradually tapers to the root, where it\r\nbecomes fine as a spider’s web. His fur has so much the hue of the moss\r\nwhich grows on the branches of the trees, that it is very difficult to\r\nmake him out when he is at rest.\r\n\r\n“The male of the three-toed sloth has a longitudinal bar of very fine\r\nblack hair on his back, rather lower than the shoulder-blades; on each\r\nside of this black bar there is a space of yellow hair, equally fine;\r\nit has the appearance of being pressed into the body, and looks exactly\r\nas if it had been singed. If we examine the anatomy of his fore-legs,\r\nwe shall immediately perceive, by their firm and muscular texture, how\r\nvery capable they are of supporting the pendent weight of his body, both\r\nin climbing and at rest; and, instead of pronouncing them a bungled\r\ncomposition, as a celebrated naturalist has done, we shall consider them\r\nas remarkably well calculated to perform their extraordinary functions.\r\n\r\n“As the sloth is an inhabitant of forests within the tropics, where the\r\ntrees touch each other in the greatest profusion, there seems to be no\r\nreason why he should confine himself to one tree alone for food, and\r\nentirely strip it of its leaves. During the many years I have ranged the\r\nforests, I have never seen a tree in such a state of nudity; indeed, I\r\nwould hazard a conjecture, that, by the time the animal had finished the\r\nlast of the old leaves, there would be a new crop on the part of the tree\r\nhe had stripped first, ready for him to begin again, so quick is the\r\nprocess of vegetation in these countries.\r\n\r\n“There is a saying amongst the Indians, that when the wind blows the\r\nsloth begins to travel. In calm weather he remains tranquil, probably\r\nnot liking to cling to the brittle extremity of the branches, lest they\r\nshould break with him in passing from one tree to another; but, as\r\nsoon as the wind rises, the branches of the neighbouring trees become\r\ninterwoven, and then the sloth seizes hold of them, and pursues his\r\njourney in safety. There is seldom an entire day of calm in these\r\nforests. The trade-wind generally sets in about ten o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and thus the sloth may set off after breakfast, and get a\r\nconsiderable way before dinner. He travels at a good round pace; and were\r\nyou to see him pass from tree to tree, as I have done, you would never\r\nthink of calling him a sloth.\r\n\r\n“Thus it would appear that the different histories we have of this\r\nquadruped are erroneous on two accounts: first, that the writers of them,\r\ndeterred by difficulties and local annoyances, have not paid sufficient\r\nattention to him in his native haunts; and secondly, they have described\r\nhim in a situation in which he was never intended by nature to cut a\r\nfigure—I mean on the ground. The sloth is as much at a loss to proceed on\r\nhis journey upon a smooth and level floor as a man would be who had to\r\nwalk a mile in stilts upon a line of feather beds.\r\n\r\n“One day, as we were crossing the Essequibo, I saw a large two-toed sloth\r\non the ground upon the bank; how he had got there nobody could tell: the\r\nIndian said he had never surprised a sloth in such a situation before:\r\nhe would hardly have come there to drink, for both above and below the\r\nplace the branches of the trees touched the water, and afforded him an\r\neasy and safe access to it. Be this as it may, though the trees were not\r\nabove twenty yards from him, he could not make his way through the sand\r\ntime enough to escape before we landed. As soon as we got up to him he\r\nthrew himself upon his back, and defended himself in gallant style with\r\nhis fore-legs. “Come, poor fellow,” said I to him, “if thou hast got into\r\na hobble to-day, thou shalt not suffer for it: I’ll take no advantage of\r\nthee in misfortune; the forest is large enough both for thee and me to\r\nrove in: go thy ways up above, and enjoy thyself in these endless wilds:\r\nit is more than probable thou wilt never have another interview with\r\nman. So fare thee well.” On saying this, I took a long stick which was\r\nlying there, held it for him to hook on, and then conveyed him to a high\r\nand stately mora. He ascended with wonderful rapidity, and in about a\r\nminute he was almost at the top of the tree. He now went off in a side\r\ndirection, and caught hold of a branch of a neighbouring tree; he then\r\nproceeded towards the heart of the forest. I stood looking on, lost in\r\namazement at his singular mode of progress. I followed him with my eye\r\ntill the intervening branches closed in betwixt us: and then I lost sight\r\nfor ever of the two-toed sloth. I was going to add, that I never saw a\r\nsloth take to his heels in such earnest; but the expression will not do,\r\nfor the sloth has no heels.\r\n\r\n“That which naturalists have advanced of his being so tenacious of life\r\nis perfectly true. I saw the heart of one beat for half an hour after\r\nit was taken out of the body. The wourali poison seems to be the only\r\nthing that will kill it quickly. On reference to a former part of these\r\nWanderings, it will be seen that a poisoned arrow killed the sloth in\r\nabout ten minutes.\r\n\r\n“So much for this harmless, unoffending animal. He holds a conspicuous\r\nplace in the catalogue of the animals of the New World. Though\r\nnaturalists have made no mention of what follows, still it is not less\r\ntrue on that account. The sloth is the only quadruped known which spends\r\nits whole life from the branch of a tree, suspended by his feet. I have\r\npaid uncommon attention to him in his native haunts. The monkey and\r\nsquirrel will seize a branch with their fore-feet, and pull themselves\r\nup, and rest or run upon it; but the sloth, after seizing it, still\r\nremains suspended, and suspended moves along under the branch, till he\r\ncan lay hold of another. Whenever I have seen him in his native woods,\r\nwhether at rest, or asleep, or on his travels, I have always observed\r\nthat he was suspended from the branch of a tree. When his form and\r\nanatomy are attentively considered, it will appear evident that the\r\nsloth cannot be at ease in any situation where his body is higher or\r\nabove his feet.”\r\n\r\nAnother tree-inhabitant is that curious, almost fabulous, creature, the\r\nvampire. Mr. Waterton says of them—“At the close of day, the vampires\r\nleave the hollow trees, whither they had fled at the morning’s dawn, and\r\nscour along the river’s banks in quest of prey. On waking from sleep,\r\nthe astonished traveller finds his hammock all stained with blood. It is\r\nthe vampire that hath sucked him. Not man alone, but every unprotected\r\nanimal, is exposed to his depredations; and so gently does this nocturnal\r\nsurgeon draw the blood, that, instead of being roused, the patient is\r\nlulled into a still profounder sleep. There are two species of vampire\r\nin Demerara, and both suck living animals: one is rather larger than the\r\ncommon bat; the other measures about two feet from wing to wing extended.\r\nAs there was a free entrance and exit to the vampire, in the loft near\r\nthe Essequibo where I slept, I had many a fine opportunity of paying\r\nattention to this winged lancer. He does not always live on blood. When\r\nthe moon shone bright, and the fruit of the banana-tree was ripe, I could\r\nsee him approach and eat it. He would also bring into the loft, from the\r\nforest, a green round fruit, something like the wild guava, and about the\r\nsize of a nutmeg. There was something also, in the blossom of the sawarri\r\nnut-tree, which was grateful to him; for on coming up Waratilla creek, in\r\na moonlight night, I saw several vampires fluttering round the top of the\r\nsawarri-tree, and every now and then the blossoms, which they had broken\r\noff, fell into the water. They certainly did not drop off naturally, for\r\non examining several of them, they appeared quite fresh and blooming. So\r\nI concluded the vampires pulled them from the tree, either to get at the\r\nincipient fruit, or to catch the insects which often take up their abode\r\nin flowers.\r\n\r\n“The vampire, in general, measures about twenty-six inches from wing\r\nto wing extended, though I once killed one which measured thirty-two\r\ninches. He frequents old abandoned houses and hollow trees; and sometimes\r\na cluster of them may be seen in the forest hanging head downwards from\r\nthe branch of a tree.\r\n\r\n“Goldsmith seems to have been aware that the vampire hangs in clusters;\r\nfor in the _Deserted Village_, speaking of America, he says—\r\n\r\n    “‘And matted woods, where birds forget to sing,\r\n    But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling.’\r\n\r\n“The vampire has a curious membrane, which rises from the nose, and gives\r\nit a very singular appearance. It has been remarked before, that there\r\nare two species of vampire in Guiana, a larger and a smaller. The larger\r\nsucks men and other animals; the smaller seems to confine himself chiefly\r\nto birds. I learnt from a gentleman, high up in the river Demerara, that\r\nhe was completely unsuccessful with his fowls, on account of the small\r\nvampire. He showed me some that had been sucked the night before, and\r\nthey were scarcely able to walk.\r\n\r\n“Some years ago I went to the river Paumaron with a Scotch gentleman, by\r\nname Tarbet. We hung our hammocks in the thatched loft of a planter’s\r\nhouse. Next morning I heard this gentleman muttering in his hammock, and\r\nnow and then letting fall an imprecation or two, just about the time he\r\nought to have been saying his morning prayers. ‘What is the matter, sir?’\r\nsaid I, softly; ‘is anything amiss?’ ‘What’s the matter!’ answered he,\r\nsurlily; ‘why, the vampires have been sucking me to death.’ As soon as\r\nthere was light enough, I went to his hammock, and saw it much stained\r\nwith blood. ‘There,’ said he, thrusting his foot out of the hammock, ‘see\r\nhow these infernal imps have been drawing my life’s blood.’ On examining\r\nhis foot, I found the vampire had tapped his great toe: there was a wound\r\nsomewhat less than that made by a leech; the blood was still oozing from\r\nit; I conjectured he might have lost from ten to twelve ounces of blood.\r\nWhilst examining it, I think I put him into a worse humour by remarking\r\nthat a European surgeon would not have been so generous as to have\r\nblooded him without making a charge. He looked up in my face, but did not\r\nsay a word; I saw he was of opinion that I had better have spared this\r\npiece of ill-timed levity.\r\n\r\n“I had often wished to have been once sucked by the vampire, in order\r\nthat I might have it in my power to say it had really happened to me.\r\nThere can be no pain in the operation, for the patient is always asleep\r\nwhen the vampire is sucking him; and as for the loss of a few ounces of\r\nblood, that would be a trifle in the long run. Many a night have I slept\r\nwith my foot out of the hammock to tempt this winged surgeon, expecting\r\nthat he would be there; but it was all in vain; the vampire never\r\nsucked me, and I could never account for his not doing so, for we were\r\ninhabitants of the same loft for months together.”\r\n\r\nThe naturalist’s description of the river Demerara is a beautiful piece\r\nof writing:—\r\n\r\n“He whose eye can distinguish the various beauties of uncultivated\r\nnature, and whose ear is not shut to the wild sounds in the woods, will\r\nbe delighted in passing the river Demerara. Every now and then the maam\r\nor tinamou sends forth one long and plaintive whistle from the depth of\r\nthe forest, and then stops; whilst the yelping of the toucan, and the\r\nshrill voice of the bird called pi-pi-yo, are heard during the interval.\r\nThe campanero never fails to attract the attention of the passenger: at a\r\ndistance of nearly three miles you may hear this snow-white bird tolling\r\nevery four or five minutes like the distant convent-bell. From six to\r\nnine in the morning, the forests resound with the mingled cries and\r\nstrains of the feathered race; after this they gradually die away. From\r\neleven to three all nature is hushed as in a midnight silence, and scarce\r\na note is heard, saving that of the campanero and the pi-pi-yo; it is\r\nthen that, oppressed by the solar heat, the birds retire to the thickest\r\nshade, and wait for the refreshing cool of evening.\r\n\r\n“At sundown the vampires, bats, and goat-suckers dart from their lonely\r\nretreat, and skim along the trees on the river’s bank. The different\r\nkinds of frogs almost stun the ear with their hoarse and hollow-sounding\r\ncroaking, while the owls and goat-suckers lament and mourn all night long.\r\n\r\n“About two hours before daybreak you will hear the red monkey moaning\r\nas though in deep distress; the houtou, a solitary bird, and only found\r\nin the thickest recesses of the forest, distinctly articulates “houtou,\r\nhoutou,” in a low and plaintive tone, an hour before sunrise; the maam\r\nwhistles about the same hour; the hannaquoi, pataca, and maroudi announce\r\nhis near approach to the eastern horizon, and the parrots and the\r\nparroquets confirm his arrival there.\r\n\r\n“The crickets chirp from sunset to sunrise, and often during the day\r\nwhen the weather is cloudy. The beterouge is extremely numerous in these\r\nextensive wilds, and not only man, but beasts and birds, are tormented\r\nby it. Mosquitoes are very rare after you pass the third island in the\r\nDemerara, and sand-flies but seldom appear.\r\n\r\n“Courteous reader, here thou hast the outlines of an amazing landscape\r\ngiven thee; thou wilt see that the principal parts of it are but faintly\r\ntraced, some of them scarcely visible at all, and that the shades are\r\nwholly wanting. If thy soul partakes of the ardent flame which the\r\npersevering Mungo Park’s did, these outlines will be enough for thee:\r\nthey will give thee some idea of what a noble country this is; and if\r\nthou hast but courage to set about giving the world a finished picture\r\nof it, neither materials to work on, nor colours to paint it in its true\r\nshades, will be wanting to thee. It may appear a difficult task at a\r\ndistance; but look close at it, and it is nothing at all; provided thou\r\nhast but a quiet mind, little more is necessary, and the genius which\r\npresides over these wilds will kindly help thee through the rest. She\r\nwill allow thee to slay the fawn and cut down the mountain-cabbage for\r\nthy support, and to select from every part of her domain whatever may be\r\nnecessary for the work thou art about; but having killed a pair of doves\r\nin order to enable thee to give mankind a true and proper description\r\nof them, thou must not destroy a third through wantonness, or to show\r\nwhat a good marksman thou art: that would only blot the picture thou art\r\nfinishing, not colour it.\r\n\r\n“Though retired from the haunts of men, and even without a friend with\r\nthee, thou would not find it solitary. The crowing of the hannaquoi will\r\nsound in thine ears like the daybreak town-clock; and the wren and thrush\r\nwill join thee in thy matin hymn to thy Creator, to thank Him for thy\r\nnight’s rest.\r\n\r\n“At noon the Genius will lead thee to the troely, one leaf of which will\r\ndefend thee from both sun and rain. And if, in the cool of the evening,\r\nthou hast been tempted to stray too far from thy place of abode, and art\r\ndeprived of light to write down the information thou hast collected, the\r\nfire-fly, which thou wilt see in almost every bush around thee, will be\r\nthy candle. Hold it over thy pocket-book, in any position which thou\r\nknowest will not hurt it, and it will afford thee ample light. And when\r\nthou hast done with it, put it kindly back again on the next branch to\r\nthee. It will want no other reward for its services.\r\n\r\n“When in thy hammock, should the thought of thy little crosses and\r\ndisappointments, in thy ups and downs through life, break in upon thee,\r\nand throw thee into a pensive mood, the owl will bear thee company.\r\nShe will tell thee that hard has been her fate too; and at intervals,\r\n‘Whip-poor-Will,’ and ‘Willy come go,’ will take up the tale of sorrow.\r\nOvid has told thee how the owl once boasted the human form, and lost it\r\nfor a very small offence; and were the poet alive now, he would inform\r\nthee that ‘Whip-poor-Will’ and ‘Willy come go’ are the shades of those\r\npoor African and Indian slaves who died worn out and broken-hearted.\r\nThey wail and cry ‘Whip-poor-Will,’ ‘Willy come go,’ all night long; and\r\noften, when the moon shines, you see them sitting on the green turf, near\r\nthe houses of those whose ancestors tore them from the bosom of their\r\nhelpless families, which all probably perished through grief and want,\r\nafter their support was gone.”\r\n\r\nThe Essequibo charmed Waterton. “Here the finest green-heart grows, and\r\nwallaba, purple-heart, siloabali, sawari, buletre, tauronira, and mora,\r\nare met with in vast abundance, far and near, towering up in majestic\r\ngrandeur, straight as pillars, sixty or seventy feet high, without a knot\r\nor branch.\r\n\r\n“Traveller, forget for a little while the idea thou hast of wandering\r\nfurther on, and stop and look at this grand picture of vegetable nature;\r\nit is a reflection of the crowd thou hast lately been in, and though a\r\nsilent monitor, it is not a less eloquent one on that account. See that\r\nnoble purple-heart before thee! Nature has been kind to it. Not a hole,\r\nnot the least oozing from its trunk, to show that its best days are\r\npassed. Vigorous in youthful blooming beauty, it stands, the ornament of\r\nthese sequestered wilds, and tacitly rebukes those base ones of thine\r\nown species who have been hardy enough to deny the existence of Him who\r\nordered it to flourish here.\r\n\r\n“Behold that one next to it! Hark! how the hammerings of the red-headed\r\nwoodpecker resound through its distempered boughs! See what a quantity\r\nof holes he has made in it, and how its bark is stained with the drops\r\nwhich trickle down from them! The lightning, too, has blasted one side of\r\nit. Nature looks pale and wan in its leaves, and her resources are nearly\r\ndried up in its extremities: its sap is tainted; a mortal sickness, slow\r\nas a consumption, and as sure in its consequences, has long since entered\r\nits frame, vitiating and destroying the wholesome juices there.\r\n\r\n“Step a few paces aside, and cast thine eye on that remnant of a mora\r\nbehind it. Best part of its branches, once so high and ornamental, now\r\nlie on the ground in sad confusion, one upon the other, all shattered\r\nand fungus-grown, and a prey to millions of insects, which are busily\r\nemployed in destroying them. One branch of it still looks healthy! Will\r\nit recover? No, it cannot: Nature has already run her course, and that\r\nhealthy-looking branch is only as a fallacious good symptom in him who\r\nis just about to die of a mortification, when he feels no more pain and\r\nfancies his distemper has left him; it is as the momentary gleam of a\r\nwintry sun’s ray close to the western horizon. See! while we are speaking\r\na gust of wind has brought the tree to the ground, and made room for its\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n“Come further on, and examine that apparently luxuriant tauronira on thy\r\nright hand. It boasts a verdure not its own; they are false ornaments it\r\nwears; the bush-rope and bird-vines have clothed it from the root to its\r\ntopmost branch. The succession of fruit which it hath borne, like good\r\ncheer in the houses of the great, has invited the birds to resort to it,\r\nand they have disseminated beautiful, though destructive, plants on its\r\nbranches, which like the distempers vice brings into the human frame,\r\nrob it of all its health and vigour; they have shortened its days, and\r\nprobably in another year they will finally kill it, long before nature\r\nintended that it should die.\r\n\r\n“Ere thou leavest this interesting scene look on the ground around thee,\r\nand see what everything here below must come to.\r\n\r\n“Behold that newly-fallen wallaba! The whirlwind has uprooted it in its\r\nprime, and it has brought down to the ground a dozen small ones in its\r\nfall. Its bark has already begun to drop off! And that heart of mora\r\nclose by it is fast yielding, in spite of its firm, tough texture.\r\n\r\n“The tree which thou passedst but a little ago, and which perhaps has\r\nlaid over yonder brook for years, can now hardly support itself, and in\r\na few months more it will have fallen into the water.\r\n\r\n“Put thy foot on that large trunk thou seest to the left. It seems entire\r\namid the surrounding fragments. Mere outward appearance, delusive phantom\r\nof what it once was! Tread on it, and, like the fuss-ball, it will break\r\ninto dust.\r\n\r\n“Sad and silent mementoes to the giddy traveller as he wanders on!\r\nProstrate remnants of vegetable nature, how incontestably ye prove what\r\nwe must all at last come to, and how plain your mouldering ruins show\r\nthat the firmest texture avails us nought when Heaven wills that we\r\nshould cease to be!—\r\n\r\n    “‘The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n    Yea, all which it inhabit, shall dissolve,\r\n    And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,\r\n    Leave not a wreck behind.’\r\n\r\n“Cast thine eye around thee, and see the thousands of nature’s\r\nproductions. Take a view of them from the opening seed on the surface,\r\nsending a downward shoot, to the loftiest and the largest trees, rising\r\nup and blooming in wild luxuriance; some side by side, others separate;\r\nsome curved and knotty, others straight as lances; all, in beautiful\r\ngradation, fulfilling the mandates they had received from Heaven, and,\r\nthough condemned to die, still never failing to keep up their species\r\ntill time shall be no more.”\r\n\r\nWaterton, in his usual clear manner, goes to the root of the matter in\r\nhis account of the celebrated wourali poison. “Though the wourali poison\r\nis used by all the South American savages betwixt the Amazons and the\r\nOroonoque, still the Macoushi tribe makes it stronger than any of the\r\nrest. The Indians in the vicinity of the Rio Negro are aware of this, and\r\ncome to the Macoushi country to purchase it.\r\n\r\n“Much has been said concerning this fatal and extraordinary poison. Some\r\nhave affirmed that its effects are almost instantaneous, provided the\r\nminutest particle of it mixes with the blood; and others again have\r\nmaintained that it is not strong enough to kill an animal of the size and\r\nstrength of a man. The first have erred by lending a too willing ear to\r\nthe marvellous, and believing assertions without sufficient proof. The\r\nfollowing short story points out the necessity of a cautious examination:—\r\n\r\n“One day, on asking an Indian if he thought the poison would kill a man,\r\nhe replied, that they always go to battle with it; that he was standing\r\nby when an Indian was shot with a poisoned arrow, and that he expired\r\nalmost immediately. Not wishing to dispute this apparently satisfactory\r\ninformation, the subject was dropped. However, about an hour after,\r\nhaving purposely asked him in what part of the body the said Indian was\r\nwounded, he answered without hesitation, that the arrow entered betwixt\r\nhis shoulders, and passed quite through his heart. Was it the weapon, or\r\nthe strength of the poison, that brought an immediate dissolution in this\r\ncase? Of course the weapon.\r\n\r\n“The second have been misled by disappointment, caused by neglect in\r\nkeeping the poisoned arrows, or by not knowing how to use them, or by\r\ntrying inferior poison. If the arrows are not kept dry, the poison loses\r\nits strength, and in wet or damp weather it turns mouldy, and becomes\r\nquite soft. In shooting an arrow in this state, upon examining the place\r\nwhere it has entered, it will be observed that, though the arrow has\r\npenetrated deep into the flesh, still by far the greatest part of the\r\npoison has shrunk back, and thus, instead of entering with the arrow,\r\nit has remained collected at the mouth of the wound. In this case the\r\narrow might as well have not been poisoned. Probably it was to this that\r\na gentleman, some time ago, owed his disappointment, when he tried the\r\npoison on a horse in the town of Stabroek, the capital of Demerara; the\r\nhorse never betrayed the least symptom of being affected by it.\r\n\r\n“Wishful to obtain the best information concerning this poison, and as\r\nrepeated inquiries, in lieu of dissipating the surrounding shade, did but\r\ntend more and more to darken the little light that existed; I determined\r\nto penetrate into the country where the poisonous ingredients grow, where\r\nthis pernicious composition is prepared, and where it is constantly used.\r\nSuccess attended the adventure; and the information acquired made amends\r\nfor one hundred and twenty days passed in the solitudes of Guiana, and\r\nafforded a balm to the wounds and bruises which every traveller must\r\nexpect to receive who wanders through a thorny and obstructed path.\r\n\r\n“Thou must not, courteous reader, expect a dissertation on the manner\r\nin which the wourali poison operates on the system; a treatise has been\r\nalready written on the subject, and, after all, there is probably still\r\nreason to doubt. It is supposed to affect the nervous system, and thus\r\ndestroy the vital functions; it is also said to be perfectly harmless,\r\nprovided it does not touch the blood. However, this is certain, when\r\na sufficient quantity of it enters the blood, death is the inevitable\r\nconsequence; but there is no alteration in the colour of the blood, and\r\nboth the blood and flesh may be eaten with safety.\r\n\r\n“All that thou wilt find here is a concise, unadorned account of the\r\nwourali poison. It may be of service to thee some time or other, shouldst\r\nthou ever travel through the wilds where it is used. Neither attribute\r\nto cruelty, nor to a want of feeling for the sufferings of the inferior\r\nanimals, the ensuing experiments. The larger animals were destroyed in\r\norder to have proof positive of the strength of a poison which hath\r\nhitherto been doubted; and the smaller ones were killed with the hope of\r\nsubstantiating that which has commonly been supposed to be an antidote.\r\n\r\n“It makes a pitying heart ache to see a poor creature in distress and\r\npain; and too often has the compassionate traveller occasion to heave\r\na sigh as he journeys on. However, here, though the kind-hearted will\r\nbe sorry to read of an unoffending animal doomed to death, in order to\r\nsatisfy a doubt, still it will be a relief to know that the victim was\r\nnot tortured. The wourali poison destroys life’s action so gently, that\r\nthe victim appears to be in no pain whatever; and probably, were the\r\ntruth known, it feels none, saving the momentary smart at the time the\r\narrow enters.\r\n\r\n“A day or two before the Macoushi Indian prepares his poison, he goes\r\ninto the forest, in quest of the ingredients. A vine grows in these\r\nwilds, which is called wourali. It is from this that the poison takes its\r\nname, and it is the principal ingredient. When he has procured enough\r\nof this, he digs up a root of a very bitter taste, ties them together,\r\nand then looks about for two kinds of bulbous plants, which contain a\r\ngreen and glutinous juice. He fills a little quake, which he carries on\r\nhis back, with the stalks of these; and lastly, ranges up and down till\r\nhe finds two species of ants. One of them is very large and black, and\r\nso venomous, that its sting produces a fever; it is most commonly to be\r\nmet with on the ground. The other is a little red ant, which stings like\r\na nettle, and generally has its nest under the leaf of a shrub. After\r\nobtaining these, he has no more need to range the forest.\r\n\r\n“A quantity of the strongest Indian pepper is used; but this he has\r\nalready planted round his hut. The pounded fangs of the Labarri snake,\r\nand those of the Counacouchi, are likewise added. These he commonly has\r\nin store; for when he kills a snake, he generally extracts the fangs, and\r\nkeeps them by him.\r\n\r\n“Having thus found the necessary ingredients, he scrapes the wourali vine\r\nand bitter root into thin shavings, and puts them into a kind of colander\r\nmade of leaves: this he holds over an earthen pot, and pours water on the\r\nshavings: the liquor which comes through has the appearance of coffee.\r\nWhen a sufficient quantity has been procured, the shavings are thrown\r\naside. He then bruises the bulbous stalks, and squeezes a proportionate\r\nquantity of their juice through his hands into the pot. Lastly, the\r\nsnake’s fangs, ants, and pepper are bruised, and thrown into it. It is\r\nthen placed on a slow fire, and as it boils, more of the juice of the\r\nwourali is added, according as it may be found necessary, and the scum\r\nis taken off with a leaf; it remains on the fire till reduced to a thick\r\nsyrup of a deep brown colour. As soon as it has arrived at this state a\r\nfew arrows are poisoned with it, to try its strength. If it answer the\r\nexpectations, it is poured out into a calabash, or little pot of Indian\r\nmanufacture, which is carefully covered with a couple of leaves, and over\r\nthem a piece of deer’s skin, tied round with a cord. They keep it in the\r\nmost dry part of the hut; and from time to time suspend it over the fire,\r\nto counteract the effects of dampness.\r\n\r\n“The act of preparing this poison is not considered as a common one: the\r\nsavage may shape his bow, fasten the barb on the point of his arrow, and\r\nmake his other implements of destruction, either lying in his hammock, or\r\nin the midst of his family; but, if he has to prepare the wourali poison,\r\nmany precautions are supposed to be necessary.\r\n\r\n“The women and young girls are not allowed to be present, lest the\r\nYabahou, or evil spirit, should do them harm. The shed under which it\r\nhas been boiled is pronounced polluted, and abandoned ever after. He who\r\nmakes the poison must eat nothing that morning, and must continue fasting\r\nas long as the operation lasts. The pot in which it is boiled must be a\r\nnew one, and must never have held anything before, otherwise the poison\r\nwould be deficient in strength: add to this, that the operator must take\r\nparticular care not to expose himself to the vapour which arises from it\r\nwhile on the fire.\r\n\r\n“Though this and other precautions are taken, such as frequent washing\r\nthe face and hands, still the Indians think that it affects the health;\r\nand the operator either is, or, what is more probable, supposes himself\r\nto be, sick for some days after.\r\n\r\n“Thus it appears that the making the wourali poison is considered as a\r\ngloomy and mysterious operation; and it would seem that they imagine it\r\naffects others as well as him who boils it; for an Indian agreed one\r\nevening to make some for me, but the next morning he declined having\r\nanything to do with it, alleging that his wife was with child!\r\n\r\n“Here it might be asked, are all the ingredients just mentioned\r\nnecessary, in order to produce the wourali poison? Though our opinions\r\nand conjectures may militate against the absolute necessity of some of\r\nthem, still it would be hardly fair to pronounce them added by the hand\r\nof superstition, till proof positive can be obtained.\r\n\r\n“We might argue on the subject, and by bringing forward instances of\r\nIndian superstition, draw our conclusion by inference, and still remain\r\nin doubt on this head. You know superstition to be the offspring of\r\nignorance, and of course that it takes up its abode amongst the rudest\r\ntribes of uncivilised men. It even too often resides with man in his more\r\nenlightened state.\r\n\r\n“The Augustan age furnishes numerous examples. A bone snatched from the\r\njaws of a fasting bitch, and a feather from the wing of a night owl—‘ossa\r\nab ore rapta jejunæ canis, plumamque nocturnæ strigis’—were necessary for\r\nCanidia’s incantations. And in after times Parson Evans, the Welshman,\r\nwas treated most ungenteelly by an enraged spirit, solely because he had\r\nforgotten a fumigation in his witch-work.\r\n\r\n“If, then, enlightened man lets his better sense give way, and believes,\r\nor allows himself to be persuaded, that certain substances and actions,\r\nin reality of no avail, possess a virtue which renders them useful\r\nin producing the wished-for effect, may not the wild, untaught,\r\nunenlightened savage of Guiana add an ingredient which, on account of\r\nthe harm it does him, he fancies may be useful to the perfection of his\r\npoison, though, in fact, it be of no use at all? If a bone snatched from\r\nthe jaws of a fasting bitch be thought necessary in incantation; or if\r\nwitchcraft have recourse to the raiment of the owl, because it resorts to\r\nthe tombs and mausoleums of the dead, and wails and hovers about at the\r\ntime that the rest of animated nature sleeps; certainly the savage may\r\nimagine that the ants, whose sting causes a fever, and the teeth of the\r\nLabarri and Counacouchi snakes, which convey death in a very short space\r\nof time, are essentially necessary in the composition of his poison; and\r\nbeing once impressed with this idea, he will add them every time he makes\r\nthe poison, and transmit the absolute use of them to his posterity. The\r\nquestion to be answered seems not to be if it is natural for the Indians\r\nto mix these ingredients, but if they are essential to make the poison.\r\n\r\n“So much for the preparing of this vegetable essence; terrible importer\r\nof death, into whatever animal it enters. Let us now see how it is used;\r\nlet us examine the weapons which bear it to its destination, and take a\r\nview of the poor victim, from the time he receives his wound till death\r\ncomes to his relief.\r\n\r\n“When a native of Macoushia goes in quest of feathered game or other\r\nbirds, he seldom carries his bow and arrows. It is the blow-pipe he then\r\nuses. This extraordinary tube of death is, perhaps, one of the greatest\r\nnatural curiosities of Guiana. It is not found in the country of the\r\nMacoushi. Those Indians tell you that it grows to the south-west of them,\r\nin the wilds which extend betwixt them and the Rio Negro. The reed must\r\ngrow to an amazing length, as the part the Indians use is from ten to\r\neleven feet long, and no tapering can be perceived in it, one end being\r\nas thick as the other. It is of a bright yellow colour, perfectly smooth\r\nboth inside and out. It grows hollow; nor is there the least appearance\r\nof a knot or joint throughout the whole extent. The natives call it\r\nourah. This, of itself, is too slender to answer the end of a blow-pipe;\r\nbut there is a species of palma, larger and stronger, and common in\r\nGuiana, and this the Indians make use of as a case, in which they put\r\nthe ourah. It is brown, susceptible of a fine polish, and appears as if\r\nit had joints five or six inches from each other. It is called samourah,\r\nand the pulp inside is easily extracted by steeping it for a few days in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“Thus the ourah and samourah, one within the other, form the blow-pipe of\r\nGuiana. The end which is applied to the mouth is tied round with a small\r\nsilk-grass cord, to prevent its splitting; and the other end, which is\r\napt to strike against the ground, is secured by the seed of the acuero\r\nfruit, cut horizontally through the middle, with a hole made in the end,\r\nthrough which is put the extremity of the blow-pipe. It is fastened\r\non with string on the outside, and the inside is filled up with wild\r\nbees’-wax.\r\n\r\n“The arrow is from nine to ten inches long. It is made out of the leaf of\r\na species of palm-tree, called Coucourite, hard and brittle, and pointed\r\nas sharp as a needle. About an inch of the pointed end is poisoned. The\r\nother end is burnt to make it still harder, and wild cotton is put round\r\nit for about an inch and a half. It requires considerable practice to\r\nput on this cotton well. It must just be large enough to fit the hollow\r\nof the tube, and taper off to nothing downwards. They tie it on with a\r\nthread of the silk-grass, to prevent its slipping off the arrow.\r\n\r\n“The Indians have shown ingenuity in making a quiver to hold the arrows.\r\nIt will contain from five to six hundred. It is generally from twelve\r\nto fourteen inches long, and in shape resembles a dice-box used at\r\nbackgammon. The inside is prettily done in basket work, with wood not\r\nunlike bamboo, and the outside has a coat of wax. The cover is all of one\r\npiece, formed out of the skin of the tapir. Round the centre there is\r\nfastened a loop, large enough to admit the arm and shoulder, from which\r\nit hangs when used. To the rim is tied a little bunch of silk-grass,\r\nand half of the jaw-bone of the fish called pirai, with which the Indian\r\nscrapes the point of his arrow.\r\n\r\n“Before he puts the arrows into the quiver, he links them together by two\r\nstrings of cotton, one string at each end, and then folds them round a\r\nstick, which is nearly the length of the quiver. The end of the stick,\r\nwhich is uppermost, is guarded by two little pieces of wood crosswise,\r\nwith a hoop round their extremities, which appears something like a\r\nwheel; and this saves the hand from being wounded when the quiver is\r\nreversed, in order to let the bunch of arrows drop out.\r\n\r\n“There is also attached to the quiver a little kind of basket, to hold\r\nthe wild cotton which is put on the blunt end of the arrow. With a quiver\r\nof poisoned arrows slung over his shoulder, and with his blow-pipe in\r\nhis hand, in the same position as a soldier carries his musket, see\r\nthe Macoushi Indian advancing towards the forest in quest of powises,\r\nmaroudis, waracabas, and other feathered game.\r\n\r\n“These generally sit high up in the tall and tufted trees, but still\r\nare not out of the Indian’s reach; for his blow-pipe, at its greatest\r\nelevation, will send an arrow three hundred feet. Silent as midnight\r\nhe steals under them, and so cautiously does he tread the ground that\r\nthe fallen leaves rustle not beneath his feet. His ears are open to the\r\nleast sound, while his eye, keen as that of the lynx, is employed in\r\nfinding out the game in the thickest shade. Often he imitates their cry,\r\nand decoys them from tree to tree, till they are within range of his\r\ntube. Then taking a poisoned arrow from his quiver, he puts it in the\r\nblow-pipe, and collects his breath for the fatal puff.\r\n\r\n“About two feet from the end through which he blows, there are fastened\r\ntwo teeth of the acouri, and these serve him for a sight. Silent and\r\nswift the arrow flies, and seldom fails to pierce the object at which it\r\nis sent. Sometimes the wounded bird remains in the same tree where it was\r\nshot, and in three minutes falls down at the Indian’s feet. Should he\r\ntake wing, his flight is of short duration, and the Indian, following the\r\ndirection he has gone, is sure to find him dead.\r\n\r\n“It is natural to imagine that, when a slight wound only is inflicted,\r\nthe game will make its escape. Far otherwise; the wourali poison almost\r\ninstantaneously mixes with blood or water, so that if you wet your\r\nfinger, and dash it along the poisoned arrow in the quickest manner\r\npossible, you are sure to carry off some of the poison. Though three\r\nminutes generally elapse before the convulsions come on in the wounded\r\nbird, still a stupor evidently takes place sooner, and this stupor\r\nmanifests itself by an apparent unwillingness in the bird to move. This\r\nwas very visible in a dying fowl.\r\n\r\n“Having procured a healthy full-grown one, a short piece of a poisoned\r\nblow-pipe arrow was broken off and run up into its thigh, as near as\r\npossible betwixt the skin and the flesh, in order that it might not\r\nbe incommoded by the wound. For the first minute it walked about, but\r\nwalked very slowly, and did not appear the least agitated. During the\r\nsecond minute it stood still, and began to peck the ground; and ere half\r\nanother elapsed, it frequently opened and shut its mouth. The tail had\r\nnow dropped, and the wings almost touched the ground. By the termination\r\nof the third minute it had sat down, scarce able to support its head,\r\nwhich nodded, and then recovered itself, and then nodded again, lower and\r\nlower every time, like that of a weary traveller slumbering in an erect\r\nposition; the eyes alternately open and shut. The fourth minute brought\r\non convulsions, and life and the fifth terminated together.\r\n\r\n“The flesh of the game is not in the least injured by poison, nor does\r\nit appear to corrupt sooner than that killed by the gun or knife. The\r\nbody of this fowl was kept for sixteen hours, in a climate damp and\r\nrainy, and within seven degrees of the equator; at the end of which time\r\nit had contracted no bad smell whatever, and there were no symptoms of\r\nputrefaction, saving that, just round the wound, the flesh appeared\r\nsomewhat discoloured.\r\n\r\n“The Indian, on his return home, carefully suspends his blow-pipe from\r\nthe top of his spiral roof; seldom placing it in an oblique position,\r\nlest it should receive a cast.\r\n\r\n“Here let the blow-pipe remain suspended, while you take a view of the\r\narms which are made to slay the larger beasts of the forest.\r\n\r\n“When the Indian intends to chase the peccari, or surprise the deer, or\r\nrouse the tapir from his marshy retreat, he carries his bow and arrows,\r\nwhich are very different from the weapons already described.\r\n\r\n“The bow is generally from six to seven feet long, and strung with a cord\r\nspun out of the silk-grass. The forests of Guiana furnish many species of\r\nhard wood, tough and elastic, out of which beautiful and excellent bows\r\nare formed.\r\n\r\n“The arrows are from four to five feet in length, made of a yellow\r\nreed without a knot or joint. It is found in great plenty up and down\r\nthroughout Guiana. A piece of hard wood, about nine inches long, is\r\ninserted into the end of the reed, and fastened with cotton well waxed. A\r\nsquare hole, an inch deep, is then made in the end of this piece of hard\r\nwood, done tight round with cotton to keep it from splitting. Into this\r\nsquare hole is fitted a spike of Coucourite wood, poisoned, and which\r\nmay be kept there or taken out at pleasure. A joint of bamboo, about as\r\nthick as your finger, is fitted on over the poisoned spike, to prevent\r\naccidents and defend it from the rain, and is taken off when the arrow is\r\nabout to be used. Lastly, two feathers are fastened on the other end of\r\nthe reed, to steady it in its flight.\r\n\r\n“Besides his bow and arrows, the Indian carries a little box, made of\r\nbamboo, which holds a dozen or fifteen poisoned spikes, six inches long.\r\nThey are poisoned in the following manner:—A small piece of wood is\r\ndipped in the poison, and with this they give the spike a first coat. It\r\nis then exposed to the sun or fire. After it is dry, it receives another\r\ncoat, and is then dried again; after this a third coat, and sometimes a\r\nfourth.\r\n\r\n“They take great care to put the poison on thicker at the middle than\r\nat the sides, by which means the spike retains the shape of a two-edged\r\nsword. It is rather a tedious operation to make one of these arrows\r\ncomplete; and as the Indian is not famed for industry, except when\r\npressed by hunger, he has hit upon a plan of preserving his arrows which\r\ndeserves notice.\r\n\r\n“About a quarter of an inch above the part where the Coucourite spike is\r\nfixed into the square hole, he cuts it half through; and thus, when it\r\nhas entered the animal, the weight of the arrow causes it to break off\r\nthere, by which means the arrow falls to the ground uninjured; so that,\r\nshould this be the only arrow he happens to have with him, and should\r\nanother shot immediately occur, he has only to take another poisoned\r\nspike out of his little bamboo box, fit it on his arrow, and send it to\r\nits destination.\r\n\r\n“Thus armed with deadly poison, and hungry as the hyæna, he ranges\r\nthrough the forest in quest of the wild beasts’ track. No hound can act\r\na surer part. Without clothes to fetter him, or shoes to bind his feet,\r\nhe observes the footsteps of the game, where a European eye could not\r\ndiscern the smallest vestige. He pursues it through all its turns and\r\nwindings with astonishing perseverance, and success generally crowns his\r\nefforts. The animal, after receiving the poisoned arrow, seldom retreats\r\ntwo hundred paces before it drops.\r\n\r\n“In passing overland from the Essequibo to the Demerara, we fell in with\r\na herd of wild hogs. Though encumbered with baggage, and fatigued with\r\na hard day’s walk, an Indian got his bow ready, and let fly a poisoned\r\narrow at one of them. It entered the cheek-bone, and broke off. The wild\r\nhog was found quite dead about one hundred and seventy paces from the\r\nplace where he had been shot. He afforded us an excellent and wholesome\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n“Thus the savage of Guiana, independent of the common weapons of\r\ndestruction, has it in his power to prepare a poison, by which he can\r\ngenerally ensure to himself a supply of animal food; and the food so\r\ndestroyed imbibes no deleterious qualities. Nature has been bountiful\r\nto him. She has not only ordered poisonous herbs and roots to grow in\r\nthe unbounded forests through which he strays, but has also furnished\r\nan excellent reed for his arrows, and another, still more singular, for\r\nhis blow-pipe; and planted trees of an amazing hard, tough, and elastic\r\ntexture, out of which he forms his bows. And in order that nothing might\r\nbe wanting she has superadded a tree which yields him a fine wax, and\r\ndisseminated up and down a plant not unlike that of the pine-apple, which\r\naffords him capital bow-strings.\r\n\r\n“Having now followed the Indian in the chase and described the poison,\r\nlet us take a nearer view of its action, and observe a large animal\r\nexpiring under the weight of its baneful virulence.\r\n\r\n“Many have doubted the strength of the wourali poison. Should they ever\r\nby chance read what follows, probably their doubts on that score will be\r\nsettled for ever.\r\n\r\n“In the former experiment on the hog some faint resistance on the part of\r\nnature was observed, as if existence struggled for superiority; but in\r\nthe following instance of the sloth, life sank in death without the least\r\napparent contention, without a cry, without a struggle, and without a\r\ngroan. This was an Ai, or three-toed sloth. It was in the possession of a\r\ngentleman who was collecting curiosities. He wished to have it killed, in\r\norder to preserve the skin, and the wourali poison was resorted to as the\r\neasiest death.\r\n\r\n“Of all animals, not even the toad and tortoise excepted, this poor\r\nill-formed creature is the most tenacious of life. It exists long after\r\nit has received wounds which would have destroyed any other animal; and\r\nit may be said, on seeing a mortally wounded sloth, that life disputes\r\nwith death every inch of flesh in its body.\r\n\r\n“The Ai was wounded in the leg, and put down on the floor, about two feet\r\nfrom the table; it contrived to reach the leg of the table, and fastened\r\nitself on it, as if wishful to ascend. But this was its last advancing\r\nstep: life was ebbing fast, though imperceptibly; nor could this singular\r\nproduction of nature, which has been formed of a texture to resist death\r\nin a thousand shapes, make any stand against the wourali poison.\r\n\r\n“First one fore-leg let go its hold, and dropped down motionless by its\r\nside; the other gradually did the same. The fore-legs having now lost\r\nstrength, the sloth slowly doubled its body and placed its head betwixt\r\nits hind legs, which still adhered to the table; but when the poison had\r\naffected these also it sank to the ground, but sank so gently, that you\r\ncould not distinguish the movement from an ordinary motion; and had you\r\nbeen ignorant that it was wounded with a poisoned arrow, you would never\r\nhave suspected that it was dying. Its mouth was shut, nor had any froth\r\nor saliva collected there.\r\n\r\n“There was no subsultus tendinum, or any visible alteration in its\r\nbreathing. During the tenth minute from the time it was wounded it\r\nstirred, and that was all; and the minute after life’s last spark\r\nwent out. From the time the poison began to operate, you would have\r\nconjectured that sleep was overpowering it, and you would have exclaimed,\r\n‘Pressitque jacentem, dulcis et alta quies, placidæque simillima morti.’\r\n\r\n“There are now two positive proofs of the effect of this fatal\r\npoison—viz., the death of the hog, and that of the sloth. But still these\r\nanimals were nothing remarkable for size; and the strength of the poison\r\nin large animals might yet be doubted, were it not for what follows.\r\n\r\n“A large well-fed ox, from nine hundred to a thousand pounds’ weight,\r\nwas tied to a stake by a rope sufficiently long to allow him to move\r\nto and fro. Having no large Coucourite spikes at hand, it was judged\r\nnecessary, on account of his superior size, to put three wild-hog arrows\r\ninto him. One was sent into each thigh just above the hock, in order to\r\navoid wounding a vital part, and the third was shot transversely into the\r\nextremity of the nostril.\r\n\r\n“The poison seemed to take effect in four minutes. Conscious as though\r\nhe would fall, the ox set himself firmly on his legs, and remained quite\r\nstill in the same place, till about the fourteenth minute, when he\r\nsmelled the ground, and appeared as if inclined to walk. He advanced a\r\npace or two, staggered, and fell, and remained extended on his side, with\r\nhis head on the ground. His eye, a few minutes ago so bright and lively,\r\nnow became fixed and dim; and though you put your hand close to it, as if\r\nto give him a blow there, he never closed his eyelid.\r\n\r\n“His legs were convulsed, and his head from time to time started\r\ninvoluntarily; but he never showed the least desire to raise it from the\r\nground; he breathed hard, and emitted foam from his mouth. The startings,\r\nor subsultus tendinum, now became gradually weaker and weaker; his hinder\r\nparts were fixed in death; and in a minute or two more his head and\r\nfore-legs ceased to stir.\r\n\r\n“Nothing now remained to show that life was still within him, except that\r\nhis heart faintly beat and fluttered at intervals. In five-and-twenty\r\nminutes from the time of his being wounded, he was quite dead. His flesh\r\nwas very sweet and savoury at dinner.\r\n\r\n“On taking a retrospective view of the two different kinds of poisoned\r\narrows, and the animals destroyed by them, it would appear that the\r\nquantity of poison must be proportioned to the animal; and thus those\r\nprobably labour under an error who imagine that the smallest particle of\r\nit introduced into the blood has almost instantaneous effects.\r\n\r\n“Make an estimate of the difference in size betwixt the fowl and the ox,\r\nand then weigh a sufficient quantity of poison for a blow-pipe arrow,\r\nwith which the fowl was killed, and weigh also enough poison for three\r\nwild-hog arrows, which destroyed the ox, and it will appear that the fowl\r\nreceived much more poison in proportion than the ox. Hence the cause why\r\nthe fowl died in five minutes, and the ox in five-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, were it the case that the smallest particle of it introduced\r\ninto the blood has almost instantaneous effects, the Indian would not\r\nfind it necessary to make the large arrow; that of the blow-pipe is much\r\neasier made, and requires less poison.\r\n\r\n“And now for the antidotes, or rather the supposed antidotes. The Indians\r\ntell you that if the wounded animal be held for a considerable time up to\r\nthe mouth in water, the poison will not prove fatal; also that the juice\r\nof the sugar-cane, poured down the throat, will counteract the effects of\r\nit. These antidotes were fairly tried upon full-grown healthy fowls, but\r\nthey all died, as though no steps had been taken to preserve their lives.\r\nRum was recommended, and given to another, but with as little success.\r\n\r\n“It is supposed by some that wind introduced into the lungs by means of\r\na small pair of bellows would revive the poisoned patient, provided the\r\noperation be continued for a sufficient length of time. It may be so: but\r\nthis is a difficult and a tedious mode of cure, and he who is wounded\r\nin the forest, far away from his friends, or in the hut of the savages,\r\nstands but a poor chance of being saved by it.\r\n\r\n“Had the Indians a sure antidote, it is likely they would carry it about\r\nwith them, or resort to it immediately after being wounded, if at hand;\r\nand their confidence in its efficacy would greatly diminish the horror\r\nthey betray when you point a poisoned arrow at them.\r\n\r\n“One day while we were eating a red monkey, erroneously called a baboon,\r\nin Demerara, an Arowack Indian told an affecting story of what happened\r\nto a comrade of his. He was present at his death. As it did not interest\r\nthis Indian in any point to tell a falsehood, it is very probable that\r\nhis account was a true one. If so, it appears that there is no certain\r\nantidote, or, at least, an antidote that could be resorted to in a case\r\nof urgent need; for the Indian gave up all thoughts of life as soon as he\r\nwas wounded.\r\n\r\n“The Arowack Indian said it was but four years ago that he and his\r\ncompanion were ranging in the forest in quest of game. His companion\r\ntook a poisoned arrow, and sent it at a red monkey in a tree above him.\r\nIt was nearly a perpendicular shot. The arrow missed the monkey, and,\r\nin the descent, struck him in the arm, a little above the elbow. He was\r\nconvinced it was all over with him. ‘I shall never,’ said he to his\r\ncompanion, in a faltering voice, and looking at his bow as he said it, ‘I\r\nshall never,’ said he, ‘bend this bow again.’ And having said that, he\r\ntook off his little bamboo poison box, which hung across his shoulder,\r\nand putting it together with his bow and arrows on the ground, he laid\r\nhimself down close by them, bid his companions farewell, and never spoke\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“He who is unfortunate enough to be wounded by a poisoned arrow from\r\nMacoushia had better not depend upon the common antidotes for a cure.\r\nMany who have been in Guiana will recommend immediate immersion in water,\r\nor to take the juice of the sugar-cane, or to fill the mouth full of\r\nsalt; and they recommend these antidotes because they have got them from\r\nthe Indians. But were you to ask them if they ever saw these antidotes\r\nused with success, it is ten to one their answer would be in the negative.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore let him reject these antidotes as unprofitable, and of no\r\navail. He has got an active and a deadly foe within him, which, like\r\nShakspeare’s fell Sergeant Death, is strict in his arrest, and will allow\r\nhim but little time—very—very little time. In a few minutes he will be\r\nnumbered with the dead. Life ought, if possible, to be preserved, be\r\nthe expense ever so great. Should the part affected admit of it, let a\r\nligature be tied tight round the wound, and have immediate recourse to\r\nthe knife:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Continuo, culpam ferro compesce priusquam,\r\n    Dira per infaustum serpant contagia corpus.’\r\n\r\n“Several experiments were subsequently made with the wourali poison.\r\nIn London an ass was inoculated with it, and died in twelve minutes.\r\nThe poison was inserted into the leg of another, round which a bandage\r\nhad been previously tied a little above the place where the wourali was\r\nintroduced. He walked about as usual, and ate his food as though all were\r\nright. After an hour had elapsed the bandage was untied, and ten minutes\r\nafter death overtook him.\r\n\r\n“A she-ass received the wourali poison in the shoulder, and died\r\napparently in ten minutes. An incision was then made in its windpipe, and\r\nthrough it the lungs were regularly inflated for two hours with a pair\r\nof bellows. Suspended animation returned. The ass held up her head, and\r\nlooked around; but the inflating being discontinued, she sank once more\r\nin apparent death. The artificial breathing was immediately recommenced,\r\nand continued without intermission for two hours more. This saved the ass\r\nfrom final dissolution: she rose up and walked about; she seemed neither\r\nin agitation nor in pain. The wound through which the poison entered was\r\nhealed without difficulty. Her constitution, however, was so severely\r\naffected, that it was long a doubt if ever she would be well again. She\r\nlooked lean and sickly for above a year, but began to mend the spring\r\nafter; and by Midsummer became fat and frisky.\r\n\r\n“The kind-hearted reader will rejoice on learning that Earl Percy,\r\npitying her misfortunes, sent her down from London to Walton Hall, near\r\nWakefield. There she went by the name of Wouralia. Wouralia was sheltered\r\nfrom the wintry storm; and when summer came she fed in the finest\r\npasture. No burden was placed upon her, and she ended her days in peace.\r\n\r\n“Poor Wouralia breathed her last on the 15th of February, 1839, having\r\nsurvived the operation nearly five-and-twenty years.”\r\n\r\nOf a certainty, the woodpecker is closely associated with tree-life; no\r\nanimal or bird so much so. Waterton tells you that “you would not be long\r\nin the forests of Demerara without noticing the woodpeckers. You meet\r\nthem feeding at all hours of the day. Well may they do so. Were they\r\nto follow the example of most of the other birds, and only feed in the\r\nmorning and evening, they would be often on short allowance, for they\r\nsometimes have to labour three or four hours at the tree before they\r\nget to their food. The sound which the largest kind makes in hammering\r\nagainst the bark of the tree is so loud, that you would never suppose\r\nit to proceed from the efforts of a bird. You would take it to be the\r\nwoodman, with his axe, trying by a sturdy blow, often repeated, whether\r\nthe tree were sound or not. There are fourteen species here; the largest\r\nthe size of a magpie, the smallest no bigger than a wren. They are all\r\nbeautiful; and the greater part of them have their heads ornamented with\r\na fine crest, movable at pleasure.\r\n\r\n“It is said that if you once give a dog a bad name, whether innocent or\r\nguilty, he never loses it. It sticks close to him wherever he goes. He\r\nhas many a kick and many a blow to bear on account of it; and there is\r\nnobody to stand up for him. The woodpecker is little better off. The\r\nproprietors of woods, in Europe, have long accused him of injuring their\r\ntimber by boring holes in it, and letting in the water, which soon rots\r\nit. The colonists in America have the same complaint against him. Had he\r\nthe power of speech, which Ovid’s birds possessed in days of yore, he\r\ncould soon make a defence. ‘Mighty lord of the woods,’ he would say to\r\nman, ‘why do you wrongfully accuse me? why do you hunt me up and down\r\nto death for an imaginary offence? I have never spoiled a leaf of your\r\nproperty, much less your wood. Your merciless shot strikes me at the very\r\ntime I am doing you a service. But your short-sightedness will not let\r\nyou see it, or your pride is above examining closely the actions of so\r\ninsignificant a little bird as I am. If there be that spark of feeling\r\nin your breast which they say man possesses, or ought to possess, above\r\nall other animals, do a poor injured creature a little kindness, and\r\nwatch me in your woods only for a day. I never wound your healthy trees.\r\nI should perish for want in the attempt. The sound bark would easily\r\nresist the force of my bill; and were I even to pierce through it, there\r\nwould be nothing inside that I could fancy, or my stomach digest. I often\r\nvisit them, it is true, but a knock or two convinces me that I must go\r\nelsewhere for support; and were you to listen attentively to the sound\r\nwhich my bill causes, you would know whether I am upon a healthy or an\r\nunhealthy tree. Wood and bark are not my food. I live entirely upon the\r\ninsects which have already formed a lodgment in the distempered tree.\r\nWhen the sound informs me that my prey is there, I labour for hours\r\ntogether till I get at it; and by consuming it, for my own support, I\r\nprevent its further depredations in that part. Thus I discover for you\r\nyour hidden and unsuspected foe, which has been devouring your wood in\r\nsuch secrecy that you had not the least suspicion it was there. The hole\r\nwhich I make in order to get at the pernicious vermin will be seen by\r\nyou as you pass under the tree. I leave it as a signal to tell you that\r\nyour tree has already stood too long. It is past its prime. Millions of\r\ninsects, engendered by disease, are preying upon its vitals. Ere long it\r\nwill fall a log in useless ruins. Warned by this loss, cut down the rest\r\nin time, and spare, O spare, the unoffending woodpecker.’”\r\n\r\nWith what evident love of his own work in life does Waterton call the\r\nmanhood of England to the glorious sport of travel! Wisely he declares\r\nthat “the youth who incautiously reels into the lobby of Drury Lane,\r\nafter leaving the table sacred to the god of wine, is exposed to more\r\ncertain ruin, sickness, and decay, than he who wanders a whole year\r\nin the wilds of Demerara. But this will never be believed; because\r\nthe disasters arising from dissipation are so common and frequent in\r\ncivilised life, that man becomes quite habituated to them; and sees daily\r\nvictims sink into the tomb long before their time, without ever once\r\ntaking alarm at the causes which precipitated them headlong into it.\r\n\r\n“But the dangers which a traveller exposes himself to in foreign\r\nparts are novel, out-of-the-way things to a man at home. The remotest\r\napprehension of meeting a tremendous tiger, of being carried off by a\r\nflying dragon, or having his bones picked by a famished cannibal—oh,\r\nthat makes him shudder! It sounds in his ears like the bursting of a\r\nbombshell. Thank Heaven, he is safe by his own fireside!\r\n\r\n“Prudence and resolution ought to be the traveller’s constant companions.\r\nThe first will cause him to avoid a number of snares which he will find\r\nin the path as he journeys on; and the second will always lend a hand\r\nto assist him if he has unavoidably got entangled in them. The little\r\ndistinctions which have been shown him at his own home ought to be\r\nforgotten when he travels over the world at large; for strangers know\r\nnothing of his former merits, and it is necessary that they should\r\nwitness them before they pay him the tribute which he was wont to receive\r\nwithin his own doors. Thus, to be kind and affable to those we meet, to\r\nmix in their amusements, to pay a compliment or two to their manners and\r\ncustoms, to respect their elders, to give a little to their distressed\r\nand needy, and to feel, as it were, at home amongst them, is the sure way\r\nto enable you to pass merrily on, and to find other comforts as sweet\r\nand palatable as those which you were accustomed to partake of amongst\r\nyour friends and acquaintance in your native land. We will now ascend\r\nin fancy on Icarian wing, and take a view of Guiana in general. See an\r\nimmense plain! betwixt two of the largest rivers in the world, level as\r\na bowling-green, save at Cayenne, and covered with trees along the coast\r\nquite to the Atlantic wave, except where the plantations make a little\r\nvacancy amongst the foliage.\r\n\r\n“Though nearly in the centre of the torrid zone, the sun’s rays are\r\nnot so intolerable as might be imagined, on account of the perpetual\r\nverdure and refreshing north-east breeze. See what numbers of broad and\r\nrapid rivers intersect it in their journey to the ocean, and that not a\r\nstone or a pebble is to be found on their banks, or in any part of the\r\ncountry, till your eye catches the hills in the interior. How beautiful\r\nand magnificent are the lakes in the heart of the forests, and how\r\ncharming the forests themselves, for miles after miles on each side of\r\nthe rivers! How extensive appear the savannas or natural meadows, teeming\r\nwith innumerable herds of cattle where the Portuguese and Spaniards are\r\nsettled, but desert as Saara where the English and Dutch claim dominion!\r\nHow gradually the face of the country rises! See the sand-hills all\r\nclothed in wood first emerging from the level, then hills a little\r\nhigher, rugged with bold and craggy rocks, peeping out from amongst the\r\nmost luxuriant timber. Then come plains, and dells, and far-extending\r\nvalleys, arrayed in richest foliage; and beyond them, mountains piled on\r\nmountains, some bearing prodigious forests, others of bleak and barren\r\naspect. Thus your eye wanders on, over scenes of varied loveliness and\r\ngrandeur, till it rests on the stupendous pinnacles of the long-continued\r\nCordilleras de los Andes, which rise in towering majesty, and command all\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n“How fertile must the lowlands be, from the accumulation of fallen leaves\r\nand trees for centuries! How propitious the swamps and slimy beds of the\r\nrivers, heated by a downward sun, to the amazing growth of alligators,\r\nserpents, and innumerable insects! How inviting the forests to the\r\nfeathered tribes, where you see buds, blossoms, green and ripe fruit,\r\nfull-grown and fading leaves, all on the same tree! How secure the wild\r\nbeasts may rove in endless mazes! Perhaps those mountains, too, which\r\nappear so bleak and naked, as if quite neglected, are, like Potosi, full\r\nof precious metals.”\r\n\r\nSagely and befitting an instructor, he gives excellent advice upon many\r\npoints, very necessary to be known of those who are engaged in seeing\r\nthe face of the earth. “I would here, gentle reader, wish to draw thy\r\nattention, for a few minutes, to physic, raiment, and diet. Shouldst thou\r\never wander through these remote and dreary wilds, forget not to carry\r\nwith thee bark, laudanum, calomel, and jalap, and the lancet. There are\r\nno druggist shops here, nor sons of Galen to apply to in time of need. I\r\nnever go encumbered with many clothes. A thin flannel waistcoat under a\r\ncheck shirt, a pair of trousers, and a hat, were all my wardrobe; shoes\r\nand stockings I seldom had on. In dry weather they would have irritated\r\nthe feet, and retarded me in the chase of wild beasts; and in the rainy\r\nseason they would have kept me in a perpetual state of damp and moisture.\r\nI eat moderately, and never drink wine, spirits, or fermented liquors\r\nin any climate. This abstemiousness has ever proved a faithful friend;\r\nit carried me triumphant through the epidemia at Malaga, where death\r\nmade such havoc about the beginning of the present century; and it has\r\nsince befriended me in many a fit of sickness, brought on by exposure\r\nto the noon-day sun, to the dews of night, to the pelting shower, and\r\nunwholesome food.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it will be as well, here, to mention a fever which came on,\r\nand the treatment of it; it may possibly be of use to thee, shouldst\r\nthou turn wanderer in the tropics: a word or two also of a wound I got\r\nin the forest, and then we will say no more of the little accidents\r\nwhich sometimes occur, and attend solely to natural history. We shall\r\nhave an opportunity of seeing the wild animals in their native haunts,\r\nundisturbed and unbroken in upon by men. We shall have time and leisure\r\nto look more closely at them, and probably rectify some errors which,\r\nfor want of proper information, or a near observance, have crept into\r\ntheir several histories.\r\n\r\n“It was in the month of June, when the sun was within a few days of\r\nCancer, that I had a severe attack of fever. There had been a deluge of\r\nrain, accompanied with tremendous thunder and lightning, and very little\r\nsun. Nothing could exceed the dampness of the atmosphere. For two or\r\nthree days I had been in a kind of twilight state of health, neither ill\r\nnor what you may call well; I yawned and felt weary without exercise, and\r\nmy sleep was merely slumber. This was the time to have taken medicine;\r\nbut I neglected to do so, though I had just been reading, ‘O navis\r\nreferent in mare te novi fluctus, O quid agis? fortiter occupa portum.’\r\nI awoke at midnight; a cruel headache, thirst, and pain in the small of\r\nthe back, informed me what the case was. Had Chiron himself been present,\r\nhe could not have told me more distinctly that I was going to have a\r\ntight brush of it, and that I ought to meet it with becoming fortitude. I\r\ndozed, and woke, and startled, and then dozed again, and suddenly awoke,\r\nthinking I was falling down a precipice.\r\n\r\n“The return of the bats to their diurnal retreat, which was in the thatch\r\nabove my hammock, informed me that the sun was now fast approaching to\r\nthe eastern horizon. I arose, in languor and in pain, the pulse at one\r\nhundred and twenty. I took ten grains of calomel and a scruple of jalap,\r\nand drank during the day large draughts of tea, weak and warm. The physic\r\ndid its duty; but there was no remission of fever or headache, though the\r\npain of the back was less acute. I was saved the trouble of keeping the\r\nroom cool, as the wind beat in at every quarter.\r\n\r\n“At five in the evening the pulse had risen to one hundred and thirty,\r\nand the headache almost insupportable, especially on looking to the\r\nright or left. I now opened a vein, and made a large orifice, to allow\r\nthe blood to rush out rapidly; I closed it after losing sixteen ounces.\r\nI then steeped my feet in warm water, and got into the hammock. After\r\nbleeding, the pulse fell to ninety, and the head was much relieved; but\r\nduring the night, which was very restless, the pulse rose again to one\r\nhundred and twenty, and at times the headache was distressing. I relieved\r\nthe headache from time to time, by applying cold water to the temples,\r\nand holding a wet handkerchief there. The next morning the fever ran\r\nvery high, and I took five more grains of calomel and ten of jalap,\r\ndetermined, whatever might be the case, this should be the last dose of\r\ncalomel. About two o’clock in the afternoon the fever remitted, and a\r\ncopious perspiration came on; there was no more headache, nor thirst, nor\r\npain in the back, and the following night was comparatively a good one.\r\nThe next morning I swallowed a large dose of castor oil: it was genuine,\r\nfor Louisa Backer had made it from the seeds of the trees which grew\r\nnear the door. I was now entirely free from all symptoms of fever, or\r\napprehensions of a return; and the morning after I began to take bark,\r\nand continued it for a fortnight. This put all to rights.\r\n\r\n“The story of the wound I got in the forest, and the mode of cure, are\r\nvery short. I had pursued a red-headed woodpecker for above a mile\r\nin the forest, without being able to get a shot at it. Thinking more\r\nof the woodpecker, as I ran along, than of the way before me, I trod\r\nupon a little hardwood stump, which was just about an inch or so above\r\nthe ground; it entered the hollow part of my foot, making a deep and\r\nlacerated wound there. It had brought me to the ground, and there I lay\r\ntill a transitory fit of sickness went off. I allowed it to bleed freely,\r\nand on reaching head-quarters washed it well and probed it, to feel if\r\nany foreign body was left within it. Being satisfied that there was none,\r\nI brought the edges of the wound together, and then put a piece of lint\r\non it, and over that a very large poultice, which was changed morning,\r\nnoon, and night. Luckily, Backer had a cow or two upon the hill; now, as\r\nheat and moisture are the two principal virtues of a poultice, nothing\r\ncould produce those two qualities better than fresh cow-dung boiled:\r\nhad there been no cows there, I could have made it with boiled grass\r\nand leaves. I now took entirely to the hammock, placing the foot higher\r\nthan the knee; this prevented it from throbbing, and was, indeed, the\r\nonly position in which I could be at ease. When the inflammation was\r\ncompletely subdued I applied a wet cloth to the wound, and every now and\r\nthen steeped the foot in cold water during the day, and at night again\r\napplied a poultice. The wound was now healing fast, and in three weeks\r\nfrom the time of the accident nothing but a scar remained; so that I\r\nagain sallied forth sound and joyful, and said to myself—\r\n\r\n    “‘I, pedes quo te rapiunt et auræ\r\n    Dum favet sol, et locus, i secundo\r\n    Omine, et conto latebras, ut olim,\r\n                              Rumpe ferarum.’\r\n\r\nNow, this contus was a tough light pole, eight feet long, on the end of\r\nwhich was fixed an old bayonet. I never went into the canoe without it;\r\nit was of great use in starting the beasts and snakes out of the hollow\r\ntrees, and in case of need, was an excellent defence.”\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Guiana forests Mr. Waterton saw the Vanilla growing\r\nluxuriantly. It creeps up the trees to the height of thirty or forty\r\nfeet. He found it difficult to get a ripe pod, as the monkeys are very\r\nfond of it, and generally take care to get them before the traveller\r\ncould. The pod hangs from the tree in the shape of a little scabbard.\r\nVayna is the Spanish for scabbard, and Vanilla for little scabbard. Hence\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\nIn his fourth journey to South America, he has something more to say\r\nregarding the sloth, and it is worth listening to:—“Here,” in Demerara,\r\n“I had a fine opportunity once more of examining the three-toed sloth.\r\nHe was in the house with me for a day or two. Had I taken a description\r\nof him as he lay sprawling on the floor, I should have misled the\r\nworld, and injured natural history. On the ground he appeared really a\r\nbungled composition, and faulty at all points; awkwardness and misery\r\nwere depicted on his countenance; and when I made him advance he sighed\r\nas though in pain. Perhaps it was that by seeing him thus, out of his\r\nelement as it were, that the Count de Buffon, in his history of the\r\nsloth, asks the question—‘Why should not some animals be created for\r\nmisery, since, in the human species, the greatest number of individuals\r\nare devoted to pain from the moment of their existence?’ Were the\r\nquestion put to me, I would answer, I cannot conceive that any of them\r\nare created for misery. That thousands live in misery there can be no\r\ndoubt; but then, misery has overtaken them in their path through life,\r\nand wherever man has come up with them, I should suppose they have seldom\r\nescaped from experiencing a certain proportion of misery.\r\n\r\n“After fully satisfying myself that it only leads the world into error to\r\ndescribe the sloth while he is on the ground, or in any place except in\r\na tree, I carried the one I had in my possession to his native haunts.\r\nAs soon as he came in contact with the branch of a tree, all went right\r\nwith him. I could see, as he climbed up into his own country, that he was\r\non the right road to happiness; and felt persuaded more than ever that\r\nthe world has hitherto erred in its conjectures concerning the sloth, on\r\naccount of naturalists not having given a description of him when he was\r\nin the only position in which he ought to have been described, namely,\r\nclinging to the branch of a tree.”\r\n\r\nThe vampires also come in for further notice. He says that “independent\r\nof the hollow trees, the vampires have another hiding-place. They clear\r\nout the inside of the large ants’ nests, and then take possession of\r\nthe shell. I had gone about half a day down the river, to a part of the\r\nforest where the wallaba-trees were in great plenty. The seeds had\r\nripened, and I was in hopes to have got the large scarlet ara, which\r\nfeeds on them. But, unfortunately, the time had passed away, and the\r\nseeds had fallen.\r\n\r\n“While ranging here in the forest, we stopped under an ants’ nest; and,\r\nby the dirt below, conjectured that it had got new tenants. Thinking it\r\nno harm to dislodge them, ‘vi et armis,’ an Indian boy ascended the tree;\r\nbut, before he reached the nest, out flew above a dozen vampires.\r\n\r\n“I have formerly remarked that I wished to have it in my power to say,\r\nthat I had been sucked by the vampire. I gave them many an opportunity,\r\nbut they always fought shy; and though they now sucked a young man of\r\nthe Indian breed very severely, as he was sleeping in his hammock in the\r\nshed next to mine, they would have nothing to do with me. His great toe\r\nseemed to have all the attractions. I examined it minutely as he was\r\nbathing it in the river at daybreak. The midnight surgeon had made a hole\r\nin it, almost of a triangular shape, and the blood was then running from\r\nit apace. His hammock was so defiled and stained with clotted blood, that\r\nhe was obliged to beg an old black woman to wash it. As she was taking it\r\ndown to the river side, she spread it out before me, and shook her head.\r\nI remarked, that I supposed her own toe was too old and tough to invite\r\nthe vampire-doctor to get his supper out of it; and she answered, with a\r\ngrin, that doctors generally preferred young people.\r\n\r\n“Nobody has yet been able to inform me how it is that the vampire manages\r\nto draw such a large quantity of blood, generally from the toe; and the\r\npatient, all the time, remains in a profound sleep. I have never heard\r\nof an instance of a man waking under the operation. On the contrary, he\r\ncontinues in a sound sleep, and at the time of rising, his eyes first\r\ninform him that there has been a thirsty thief on his toe.\r\n\r\n“The teeth of the vampire are very sharp, and not unlike those of a rat.\r\nIf it be that he inflicts the wound with his teeth (and he seems to\r\nhave no other instruments), one would suppose that the acuteness of the\r\npain would cause the person who is sucked to awake. We are in darkness\r\nin this matter; and I know of no means by which one might be enabled to\r\nthrow light upon it. It is to be hoped that some future wanderer through\r\nthe wilds of Guiana will be more fortunate than I have been, and catch\r\nthis nocturnal depredator in the fact. I have once before mentioned that\r\nI killed a vampire which measured thirty-two inches from wing to wing\r\nextended; but others, which I have since examined, have generally been\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-six inches in dimension.”\r\n\r\nMr. Waterton corrects a common mistake as to the statements concerning\r\nthe imitative actions of monkeys in casting back at men fruit and sticks\r\nin return for being pelted with stones. He believes that “travellers\r\nhave erred in asserting that the monkeys of South America throw sticks\r\nand fruit at their pursuers. I have had fine opportunities of narrowly\r\nwatching the different species of monkeys which are found in the wilds,\r\nbetwixt the Amazons and the Oroonoque. I entirely acquit them of acting\r\non the offensive. When the monkeys are in the high trees over your head,\r\nthe dead branches will now and then fall down upon you, having been\r\nbroken off as the monkeys pass along them; but they are never hurled from\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n“Monkeys, commonly so called, both in the old and new continent, may be\r\nclassed into three grand divisions—namely, the ape, which has no tail\r\nwhatever; the baboon, which has only a short tail; and the monkey, which\r\nhas a long tail. There are no apes and no baboons as yet discovered in\r\nthe New World. Its monkeys may be very well and very briefly ranged under\r\ntwo heads—namely, those with hairy and bushy tails, and those whose tails\r\nare bare of hair underneath, about six inches from the extremity. Those\r\nwith hairy and bushy tails climb just like the squirrel, and make no\r\nuse of the tail to help them from branch to branch. Those which have\r\nthe tail bare underneath towards the end find it of infinite advantage\r\nto them in their ascent and descent. They apply it to the branch of the\r\ntree, as though it were a supple finger, and frequently swing by it from\r\nthe branch like the pendulum of a clock. It answers all the purposes of a\r\nfifth hand to the monkey, as naturalists have already observed.\r\n\r\n“The large red monkey of Demerara is not a baboon, though it goes by that\r\nname, having a long prensile tail.[2] Nothing can sound more dreadful\r\nthan its nocturnal howlings. While lying in your hammock in these gloomy\r\nand immeasurable wilds, you hear him howling at intervals, from eleven\r\no’clock at night till daybreak. You would suppose that half the wild\r\nbeasts of the forest were collecting for the work of carnage. Now it is\r\nthe tremendous roar of the jaguar, as he springs on his prey; now it\r\nchanges to his terrible and deep-toned growlings, as he is pressed on all\r\nsides by superior force; and now you hear his last dying moan, beneath a\r\nmortal wound.\r\n\r\n    [2] I believe _prensile_ is a new-coined word. I have seen it,\r\n    but do not remember where.\r\n\r\n“Some naturalists have supposed that these awful sounds, which you would\r\nfancy are those of enraged and dying wild beasts, proceed from a number\r\nof the red monkeys howling in concert. One of them alone is capable of\r\nproducing all these sounds; and the anatomist, on an inspection of the\r\ntrachea, will be fully satisfied that this is the case. When you look at\r\nhim, as he is sitting on the branch of a tree, you will see a lump in his\r\nthroat the size of a large hen’s egg. In dark and cloudy weather, and\r\njust before a squall of rain, this monkey will often howl in the daytime;\r\nand if you advance cautiously, and get under the high and tufted tree\r\nwhere he is sitting, you may have a capital opportunity of witnessing his\r\nwonderful powers of producing these dreadful and discordant sounds.\r\n\r\n“His flesh is good food; but when skinned his appearance is so like that\r\nof a young one of our own species, that a delicate stomach might possibly\r\nrevolt at the idea of putting a knife and fork into it. However, I can\r\naffirm, from experience, that after a long and dreary march through these\r\nremote forests, the flesh of this monkey is not to be sneezed at, when\r\nboiled in Cayenne pepper, or roasted on a stick over a good fire. A young\r\none tastes not unlike kid, and the old ones have somewhat the flavour of\r\nhe-goat.\r\n\r\n“I mentioned, in a former adventure, that I had hit upon an entirely\r\nnew plan of making the skins of quadrupeds retain their exact form and\r\nfeature. Intense application to the subject has, since that period,\r\nenabled me to shorten the process, and hit the character of an animal\r\nto a very great nicety, even to the preservation of the pouting lip,\r\ndimples, warts, and wrinkles on the face. I got a fine specimen of the\r\nhowling monkey, and took some pains with it, in order to show the immense\r\ndifference that exists betwixt the features of this monkey and those of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“I also procured an animal which has caused not a little speculation and\r\nastonishment. In my opinion, his thick coat of hair, and great length\r\nof tail, put his species out of all question; but then, his face and\r\nhead cause the inspector to pause for a moment, before he ventures to\r\npronounce his opinion of the classification. He was a large animal, and\r\nas I was pressed for daylight, and, moreover, felt no inclination to have\r\nthe whole weight of his body upon my back, I contented myself with his\r\nhead and shoulders, which I cut off, and have brought them with me to\r\nEurope. I have since found that I acted quite right in doing so, having\r\nhad enough to answer for. The head alone, without saying anything of\r\nhis hands and feet, and of his tail, which is an appendage, Lord Kames\r\nasserts, belongs to us.\r\n\r\n“The features of this animal are quite of the Grecian cast; and he has\r\na placidity of countenance which shows that things went well with him\r\nwhen in life. Some gentlemen of great skill and talent, on inspecting\r\nhis head, were convinced that the whole series of its features has been\r\nchanged. Others again have hesitated, and betrayed doubts, not being able\r\nto make up their minds whether it be possible that the brute features of\r\nthe monkey can be changed into the noble countenance of man.—‘Scinditur\r\nvulgus.’ One might argue at considerable length on this novel subject,\r\nand perhaps, after all, produce little more than prolix pedantry. ‘Vox et\r\npræterea nihil.’\r\n\r\n“Indian-rubber belongs to the tree-world, and if ever there should\r\nbe a great demand for large supplies of gum-elastic, commonly called\r\nIndian-rubber, it may be procured in abundance far away in the wilds of\r\nDemerara and Essequibo.\r\n\r\n“Some years ago, when I was in the Macoushi country, there was a capital\r\ntrick played upon me about Indian-rubber. It is almost too good to be\r\nleft out of these Wanderings, and it shows that the wild and uneducated\r\nIndian is not without abilities. Weary and sick, and feeble through loss\r\nof blood, I arrived at some Indian huts, which were about two hours\r\ndistant from the place were the gum-elastic trees grew. After a day and a\r\nnight’s rest, I went to them, and with my own hands made a fine ball of\r\npure Indian-rubber; it hardened immediately as it became exposed to the\r\nair, and its elasticity was almost incredible.\r\n\r\n“While procuring it, exposure to the rain, which fell in torrents,\r\nbrought on a return of inflammation in the stomach, and I was obliged\r\nto have recourse again to the lancet, and to use it with an unsparing\r\nhand. I wanted another ball, but was not in a fit state the next morning\r\nto proceed to the trees. A fine interesting young Indian, observing my\r\neagerness to have it, tendered his services, and asked two handfuls of\r\nfish-hooks for his trouble.\r\n\r\n“Off he went, and, to my great surprise, returned in a very short time.\r\nBearing in mind the trouble and time it had cost me to make a ball, I\r\ncould account for this Indian’s expedition in no other way except that,\r\nbeing an inhabitant of the forest, he knew how to go about his work in\r\na much shorter way than I did. His ball, to be sure, had very little\r\nelasticity in it. I tried it repeatedly, but it never rebounded a yard\r\nhigh. The young Indian watched me with great gravity; and when I made him\r\nunderstand that I expected the ball would dance better, he called another\r\nIndian, who knew a little English, to assure me that I might be quite\r\neasy on that score. The young rogue, in order to render me a complete\r\ndupe, brought the new moon to his aid. He gave me to understand that the\r\nball was like the little moon, which he pointed to, and by the time it\r\ngrew big and old the ball would bounce beautifully. This satisfied me,\r\nand I gave him the fish-hooks, which he received without the least change\r\nof countenance.\r\n\r\n“I bounced the ball repeatedly for two months after, but I found that it\r\nstill remained in its infancy. At last I suspected that the savage (to\r\nuse a vulgar phrase) had come Yorkshire over me, and so I determined to\r\nfind out how he had managed to take me in. I cut the ball in two, and\r\nthen saw what a taut trick he had played me. It seems he had chewed some\r\nleaves into a lump, the size of a walnut, and then dipped them into the\r\nliquid gum-elastic. It immediately received a coat about as thick as a\r\nsixpence. He then rolled some more leaves round it, and gave it another\r\ncoat. He seems to have continued this process till he had made the ball\r\nconsiderably larger than the one I had procured; and, in order to put his\r\nroguery out of all chance of detection, he made the last and outer coat\r\nthicker than a dollar. This Indian would, no doubt, have thriven well in\r\nsome of our great towns.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONKEY AMONGST MEN, OR THE HOUSE IN REGENT’S PARK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONKEY AMONGST MEN, OR THE HOUSE IN REGENT’S PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD WORLD MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nThe Monkey House is always a favoured resort with those who visit the\r\nZoological Gardens, and, in spite of its somewhat close atmosphere\r\nand very disagreeable odour, one of the most attractive spots in the\r\ninstitution. As the number of species is very considerable, it will be\r\nimpossible to condense the needful information into the limits of a\r\nsingle paper. I purpose, therefore, to separate the subject into two\r\ndivisions, namely, the Monkeys of the Old and New Worlds. This is not\r\nmerely an arbitrary classification to suit the present purpose, but is\r\nfounded upon important differences of structure, which will be mentioned\r\nwhen we arrive at the history of the New World Monkeys.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young observer is probably aware that the apes, monkeys, and baboons\r\nare distinguished from all other animals by the structure of their limbs.\r\nThey have no feet suited for progression on a level surface, but are\r\nfurnished with four quasi-hands, enabling them to cling to the branches,\r\namong which is their chief residence. In consequence of this structure,\r\nthey are totally unable to walk properly, or even to stand upright,\r\ntheir knees being always bent, and their fore hands ready to act as feet.\r\nIndeed, I have seen many a man walk better on his hands than any monkey\r\non its feet.\r\n\r\nMany writers have laid much stress on the hand-like form of the fore\r\npaws, and founded upon that structure a theory that the Quadrumana bear\r\nsome relation to mankind. The opposable thumb is the chief characteristic\r\nupon which these writers insist for the support of their theory. Now, if\r\nwe examine the fore and hind paws of any monkey, we shall find that in\r\nthe fore paws the thumb, although it can be opposed to the fingers, is a\r\nvery small and undeveloped member, scarcely visible in some species, and\r\nentirely absent in others. It is not used for the many delicate purposes\r\nto which the human thumb is applied, nor does it aid in the grasp of the\r\nbranches. On the contrary, when the monkey seizes a branch, the thumb\r\nlies by the side of the fingers, and is unemployed until the animal is at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nNow look at the hind paws. It is true that the thumb is very large and\r\nopposable, and that it can grasp very tightly; but there its mission\r\nends. It is essentially a grasping member, like the foot of the parrot,\r\nor any other scansorial bird, and is used for that purpose alone. It has\r\nnot the slightest claim to be elevated to the rank of a hand, and is, in\r\ncommon with the fore paw, nothing more or less than an arboreal foot.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject, I must briefly mention that the head is not\r\nset on the neck like that of man. The hole through which the spinal cord\r\npasses into the brain is set so far back upon the skull that the muzzle\r\nis thrown downwards; and, like all other animals, the monkey is incapable\r\nof assuming the erect aspect of man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great apes, such as the Orang-outan and the Chimpanzee, have\r\nunfortunately died. We should also observe that, as it is some years\r\nsince the Rev. J. G. Wood wrote these papers, the _personnel_ of\r\nthe cages will have changed. We pass, therefore, onwards to that\r\ngroup of pretty, long-tailed monkeys that are ranked under the genus\r\nCercopithecus, a name which I do not translate, because your Greek\r\nLexicons will explain its meaning. They are all natives of Africa, and\r\nextremely plentiful in different parts of that vast continent, so that\r\nthey are frequently brought to England, and may be seen in menageries,\r\naccompanying barrel-organs, or even domesticated as pets in private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of one genus are often placed in the same cage, so that,\r\nin order to distinguish them, it will be necessary to examine their form\r\nand colour with care, and then to compare the animal with the description.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur first example is the Mona (_Cercopithecus Mona_), a native of Western\r\nAfrica. This monkey is brown, with darkish limbs, and a dark band across\r\nthe forehead, and there is a light spot upon each side of the tail. At\r\npresent here is only one specimen of this monkey. It is a pretty little\r\ncreature—that is, if we can call any monkey pretty—and is not more\r\nmischievous than the generality of these creatures, while it is, perhaps,\r\na little more endurable.\r\n\r\nSo much, however, depends upon the management of the animal, that the\r\nconduct of any isolated individual forms no guide to the character of\r\nthe species. I have now before me two printed accounts of the Mona, in\r\none of which it is said to be mischievous, malicious, passionate, and\r\ndisobedient, while in the other its character is stated to be mild,\r\naffectionate, and docile. But these accounts are founded on the conduct\r\nof living specimens, and the conclusion which I deduce from them is,\r\nthat the owner of the first-mentioned animal was unsympathetic and\r\nhasty-tempered, while the possessor of the second was fond of the little\r\ncreature under his care, and behaved kindly to it.\r\n\r\nI do not particularly recommend a monkey as a pet, because the animal\r\nrequires great attention in this climate, and, unless its habitation be\r\nkept most scrupulously clean, the odour which it exhales is positively\r\nhorrible. See, for example, how beautifully clean are the cages in the\r\nZoological Gardens, and yet how very unpleasant is their odour. If,\r\ntherefore, a monkey should be presented to any reader of this book, I\r\nstrongly recommend him to transfer it to some public institution.\r\n\r\nSome lads, however, are monkey-mad, and would prefer to keep the animal.\r\nIf they should by any chance do so, let them give the animal plenty of\r\nspace wherein it may exercise its active limbs, and, above all things,\r\nkeep it in a warm room during cold or wet weather. In this climate the\r\nmonkeys generally die from diseased lungs, and they must accordingly be\r\nshielded from draughts and moisture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor our next examples we must pass under the tunnel, and visit the room\r\nin which those wonderful Spider Monkeys are placed. In a moderately-sized\r\ncage are several specimens of two closely-allied species, which may be\r\neasily distinguished by attending to the descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe first of these creatures is the Moustache Monkey (_Cercopithecus\r\nCephus_). It is a very little and a very elegant monkey, looking quite\r\nbrilliant with its yellow tufts on the side of its face, and its blue\r\nskin. In the same cage are some specimens of the Red-eared Monkey\r\n(_Cercopithecus erythrotis_), also with yellow tufts on the side of the\r\nface. They can, however, be at once distinguished from the last-mentioned\r\nspecies by the colour of the bare skin on the face, which is pink instead\r\nof blue. The long tail, moreover, is of a bright chestnut hue, darkening\r\ntowards the tip. This species comes from Fernando Po, a little island on\r\nthe western coast of Africa, in the Bight of Biafra, where the lover of\r\nanimals finds abundantly birds, beasts, and fishes. Both these little\r\ncreatures are meek, gentle, and somewhat timid. They do not, however,\r\nseem to present any salient point worthy of particular mention. One\r\nlittle fellow is very conspicuous among its companions by the sable\r\ntintings of its fur, and its white eyebrows. This is the Pluto Monkey\r\n(_Cercopithecus Pluto_), so called because its dark and sombre hues are\r\nthought to be emblematical of the gloomy King of Orcus.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these monkeys are the Mangabeys, several specimens of\r\nwhich are in the Zoological Gardens. Two species may be seen in the same\r\ncage in the Monkey House, and very funny creatures they are.\r\n\r\nOf these two animals, the Lunulated Monkey is, perhaps, the greatest\r\nfavourite with the public, not because it is more engaging in its\r\nmanners, but on account of its petulance and the quaint manner in which\r\nit shows its displeasure.\r\n\r\nIt takes offence very readily, and, like certain irritable human beings,\r\nalways thinks that some one is ridiculing it, and straightway flies\r\ninto a passion. It dashes at its supposed foe, squeaks with rage, grins\r\nfuriously, showing all its teeth, and agitates its eyebrows violently,\r\nproducing a most absurd effect, as the skin of that part of the face\r\nis nearly white, and its alternate display and concealment never\r\nfail to raise much merriment among the spectators. This, of course,\r\nonly irritates the monkey still further, and those who happen to be\r\nstanding in front of the cage will act wisely by holding themselves well\r\naloof, for the monkey darts its hand between the bars with wonderful\r\nrapidity, and will tear a piece out of a lady’s dress, or sadly injure a\r\ncoat-skirt, before the keeper can interfere.\r\n\r\nEven when no one is attempting to irritate it, the creature utters a few\r\noccasional growls, as if to give warning that it does not mean to be\r\noffended without taking notice of the insult. The colour of this monkey\r\ncan be very well imitated by diluted lampblack, and the creature can\r\nalways be recognised by the white eyelids. Both these monkeys come from\r\nWestern Africa.\r\n\r\nOf the genus Macacus there are several examples. There are no less than\r\nseven specimens of the Bonnet Macaque (_Macacus pileatus_), a monkey that\r\nmay be recognised by the manner in which the hair of the head is parted\r\nin the middle, after the fashion of the modern dandy. The general tint of\r\nthe fur is pale brown, but that of the head is black—a peculiarity which\r\nhas earned for the creature its popular name. These monkeys are funny\r\nlittle fellows, with a peculiar wistful, peering expression in their\r\nfaces, which I do not remember to have noticed in any other species.\r\nThey are fond of gathering together in the window, selecting the spot\r\nwhere the sunbeams fall; and there they squat all in a group, so closely\r\npressed together that no separate bodies can be distinguished, and they\r\nseem to be little more than a large bunch of fur, from which a number of\r\nheads and tails protrude confusedly.\r\n\r\nThe Round-faced Macaque (_Macacus cyclopis_) deserves a passing notice.\r\nIt is a stout, sturdy little creature, with rather short limbs in\r\nproportion to the size of its body, a bold, pinky face, and fur of\r\na sooty brown colour. Though strong and muscular, and climbing with\r\nwonderful address, it is hardly so active as the more slenderly-made\r\nmonkeys; and when it leaps from a small height to the ground it comes\r\ndown with a thump and a flounce, as if the limbs were not accustomed to\r\nsuch exertion. It is a native of Formosa.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the Pig-tailed Macaques (_Macacus nemestrinus_) are\r\ndead. They were, perhaps, the most amusing denizens of the Monkey House,\r\nwith unrivalled capabilities of planning and executing mischief, and\r\nalways having so comical an air about them that even the sufferer from\r\ntheir misdeeds could not be angry with them. I hope that new specimens\r\nwill arrive, when they may be recognised by the peculiarity from which\r\nthey derive their name, their slender, short tails bearing a singular\r\nresemblance to the caudal extremities of the porcine tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONNET AND MACAQUE MONKEYS.—_Page 252._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHESUS MONKEY AND YOUNG.—_Page 253._]\r\n\r\nThere are two specimens of the Toque (_Macacus radiatus_), odd little\r\ncreatures, which look just as if they had been crying. One looks as if it\r\nhad been drinking as well, for its face is quite red and flushed. They\r\nare not quite so strong-jawed as some of the species, and, therefore,\r\nprefer buns to nuts, the shells being often too hard for them. This\r\nspecies is sometimes called the Zati, and sometimes is described under\r\nthe name of Capped Macaque. It is a native of India. The common Macaque\r\n(_Macacus cynomolgus_) is also represented by several specimens. The\r\ncolour of its fur is greenish brown above, and yellowish or whitish\r\nbelow. All the species of this genus bear a great resemblance to each\r\nother, and the young naturalist will find that the task of distinguishing\r\nthem is at the same time difficult and instructive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rhesus is a lively and amusing animal. There are no less than ten\r\nspecimens of this monkey in the establishment, one of which, a remarkably\r\nfine fellow, called Jumbo by the keeper, is in the habit of displaying\r\nsome very singular antics.\r\n\r\nHe climbs upon a strong bar that crosses his cage, and, fixing his hands\r\ntightly, jumps up and down rapidly with his hind paws, bringing them\r\ndown on the bar with a mighty thump, and shaking the whole place with\r\nthe violence of his exertions. The keepers have their pet names for all\r\nthe conspicuous monkeys. Jumbo is the largest of them, and next in order\r\ncome Jim and Nancy. Nancy is not permitted to associate with the other\r\nmonkeys, because she has a baby, and her companions would assuredly tease\r\nand worry both the mother and her child.\r\n\r\nBy special favour the reader may, perhaps, be permitted to see this\r\ninteresting pair of animals, and it is pretty to watch the care which\r\nthe parent takes of her offspring, and the extreme jealousy with which\r\nshe regards the least movement of the spectator. She flies forward with\r\ngrinning teeth and flashing eyes, shakes the bars of her cage violently,\r\nand chatters her wrathful defiance to the imagined enemy. The little one\r\nis in its way quite as shy, and whenever it takes alarm it leaps at its\r\nmother, clasps her round the neck and waist with its hands and feet, and\r\nlies, not on her back, as artists so frequently misrepresent, but under\r\nher belly, pressed so tightly to her body and buried so deeply in her\r\nfur, that at a little distance it cannot be distinguished. The rapidity\r\nof the movement is really astonishing. There is a quick spring, and in an\r\ninstant the little creature is snugly settled in its natural cradle.\r\n\r\nThe baby looks ten times as old as the mother. Its face is puckered into\r\na hundred wrinkles, and its skin hangs loose and flabby on its cheeks.\r\n\r\nWhile I was watching this interesting pair, both mother and child became\r\nactuated by a common emotion. Their eyes sparkled with excitement; they\r\nglared anxiously through the bars of the cage, and they chattered with\r\neager expectation. The keeper had put his hand into the pocket where he\r\nkept his apples, and the monkeys had seen the movement. The desired fruit\r\nwas cut and given to the expecting animals, and then, I regret to say,\r\nthe mother monkey displayed a more unamiable character than I should have\r\nthought her capable of possessing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her evident fondness for her offspring, and her jealousy of\r\nstrangers, she behaved very selfishly, snatched a piece of apple from\r\nher child and ate it herself, scolding it the while for daring to eat\r\nanything which she wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANUBIS BABOON.—_Page 255._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WANDEROO MONKEY.—_Page 255._]\r\n\r\nThe child, however, was by no means disposed to acquiesce in this\r\nappropriation, and when its mother came to take away the next piece of\r\napple that was given to it, the little creature popped the morsel into\r\nits mouth. The piece of apple was, however, so large, and the young\r\nmonkey’s mouth so small, that the greater portion projected from its\r\njaws. The mother made a sharp snatch at the projecting portion, but this\r\ntime the young one was too quick for her, and, striking the apple smartly\r\nwith the back of its hand, drove it fairly into its mouth. I really\r\nthought that the little animal would be choked, so greatly were its\r\ncheeks distended. But by some ingenious process it contrived to nibble\r\naway the apple, and seemed rather pleased than inconvenienced by the huge\r\nmorsel which it had forced into its mouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn another cage is a small specimen of the Wanderoo (_Silenus veter_).\r\n\r\nWhen adult and in good condition, this monkey is notable for the enormous\r\nmane which falls over the head and shoulders, and bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the full-dress wig of a judge. In the young specimen this\r\nhairy mass is but short and scanty, and it is not until the creature has\r\nreached its full growth that the wig flows around its head in such massy\r\nwaves. The top of the head is black, but the wig—if we may retain that\r\nterm—takes a greyish and sometimes a white hue along the sides, and gives\r\na very venerable aspect to the monkey.\r\n\r\nThe fur of the Wanderoo is very black, without any gloss, and in allusion\r\nto this hue the Indians call it Neel-bhunder—_i.e._, Black monkey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a large cage at one end of the room sits in solitary state a fine\r\nspecimen of the Anubis Baboon (_Cynocephalus Anubis_). In all the\r\nmembers of this genus the face is lengthened into a decided snout, at\r\nthe extremity of which are placed the nostrils. This peculiarity gives a\r\nvery morose aspect to the animals, which is certainly not belied by their\r\ntempers. All the Cynocephali are natives of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe fur of the male Anubis is very thick over the shoulders and upper\r\nparts of the body, and has a greenish cast, each hair being alternately\r\nblack and yellow. The nose and bare skin of the face are brown.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is rather tetchy in disposition; and as he is an enormously\r\npowerful animal, the bars of his cage are defended by strong wire\r\nnetwork, so that he cannot pass his hand between them. One day a\r\ngentleman who was visiting the Monkey House chose to act contrary to\r\nregulations, and poked his stick through the bars for the purpose of\r\nirritating the baboon. The animal immediately seized it, and a pulling\r\nmatch commenced in which the baboon was easily victorious, dragging the\r\ngold-headed stick into his cage and keeping it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all precautions, I regret to say that some of the visitors\r\nbehave very badly to the animals. On Mondays especially, when the price\r\nof admission to the Gardens is only sixpence, the monkeys are shamefully\r\nteased.\r\n\r\nThe Anubis is always in a constant state of irritation on those days, and\r\non one occasion had recourse to a rather curious device. He took up a\r\nhandful of straw and fixed it on his perch close to the wires. This bunch\r\nof straw he seemed to regard much as the combative Irishman regards the\r\ncoat-tail which he is trailing on the ground—resented with his utmost\r\nfury every attempt to touch it.\r\n\r\nI once put him in a terrible passion. He is very fond of raw eggs, and\r\nthe keeper produced a fine fresh one from his pocket. The Anubis saw it\r\nat once, and descended from his perch in anxious expectation. Wishing\r\nto see what the animal would do, I took the egg from the keeper, put it\r\nunder my coat, and walked away. The baboon immediately flew into a fury;\r\nhis eyes shot forth angry fires, and he jerked himself about in the\r\noddest manner; he uttered guttural grunts, and followed me about with his\r\neyes as if he would kill me.\r\n\r\nI then returned the egg to the keeper, who opened the door of the cage\r\nand flung the egg at the baboon. The animal caught it with the dexterity\r\nof a juggler, and put it into his mouth. He then held his nose in the air\r\nso as to permit the egg to roll to the back of his jaws, and with the\r\nunder-teeth he broke the egg-shell, permitting its contents to flow down\r\nhis throat. After the lapse of a few minutes, he just opened his mouth\r\nand protruded the fragments of the egg-shell, each portion of which he\r\nlicked with economical care before he threw it on the floor of his cage.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a gentleman, being anxious to discover the number of eggs\r\nthat the animal would take, purchased sixpennyworth on his way to the\r\nGardens. Eggs were then sold fourteen for a shilling. When he arrived\r\nat the Monkey House he produced the basket of eggs, and threw them to\r\nthe baboon in rapid succession. The animal caught them all, and stowed\r\naway six in his cheeks, three on either side. There was no space for the\r\nseventh, so he ate it at once, and finished the others at his leisure.\r\nOnce or twice a rotten egg has intruded into his mouth, and on such\r\noccasions his wrath is extreme.\r\n\r\nThis animal has a curious habit of sitting with his face to the wall, and\r\nfixing all his four paws against it on a level with his nose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the opposite cage are two specimens of a North African species—namely,\r\nthe Arabian Baboon, sometimes called the Tartarin (_Cynocephalus\r\nHamadryas_). This is a very handsome species, with a mass of long grey\r\nhair falling from the shoulders of the male, giving it a very poodle-like\r\naspect, especially when it is seated. It is much more quiet than the\r\nAnubis, and is fond of assuming very remarkable attitudes, too numerous\r\nand too varied to be described. In Mr. Waterton’s museum at Walton Hall\r\nthere is a splendid specimen of this beast, prepared after the unique\r\nstyle of that eminent naturalist, perfectly hollow, and without wires\r\nor any support whatever. It is so lifelike, indeed, that it is not\r\nexhibited in the museum. This animal was obtained from a large travelling\r\nmenagerie, where it had lived for some time under the grandiloquent title\r\nof Lion-slayer, though neither it nor any other baboon ever slew a lion\r\nin their lives.\r\n\r\nThere is a small specimen of the Chacma, or Pig-faced Baboon\r\n(_Cynocephalus porcarius_). This species inhabits Southern Africa, where\r\nit is very plentiful in certain spots.\r\n\r\nIf taken when young the Chacma is easily tamed, and becomes a very\r\namusing animal, retaining its good-humour in spite of the teasing to\r\nwhich it is so often subjected. The word Chacma is a corruption from the\r\nHottentot name of the animal, T’chakamma, the T’ representing one of\r\nthose strange clicking sounds peculiar to the South African languages, so\r\ndifficult of imitation, and so impossible of description.\r\n\r\nIn his native country the tame Chacma is often used for a very important\r\npurpose—namely, the discovery of water. The animal is purposely deprived\r\nof all liquid for a day or two, and is then suffered to go in search of\r\nwater, being led by a long rope. The keen instinct of the poor thirsty\r\nanimal is sure to guide it towards the desired object, and if any water\r\nbe near the spot the baboon is a certain guide to the stream or fountain.\r\n\r\nTwo other species of this genus are in the Monkey House, but neither of\r\nthem present any salient points of interest. One is the Guinea Baboon\r\n(_Cynocephalus papio_), a very young and small specimen, and the other is\r\nthe Yellow Baboon (_Cynocephalus papioides_). This little animal can at\r\nonce be recognised by the peculiarity from which it draws its name, the\r\nfur being conspicuously yellow. It is rather a good-tempered animal, and\r\ngives very little trouble to the keeper.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful Mandrill (_Papio Mormon_) is, I am sorry to say, numbered\r\namong the dead, but it is probable that its place may soon be filled by\r\nanother specimen. It is, without doubt, the most interesting among the\r\nmonkeys of the Old World, its ribbed cheeks being decorated with colours\r\nso brilliant that they seem to have been laid on with a painter’s brush\r\ndipped in the brightest tints which his palette could furnish.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW WORLD MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nWe now leave the true monkeys of the Old World, and pass to those of the\r\nNew. I say the _true_ monkeys, because we shall, in the course of the\r\npresent paper, recur to a portion of the Old World, as certain beings are\r\nfound there which undoubtedly belong to the quadrumanous order, but which\r\ndepart in many points from the characteristics of the true monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the Zoological Gardens have done rightly in transferring\r\nthe greater number of the New World monkeys to a separate building. Their\r\npeculiar temperament requires extended space, and their delicate lungs\r\nneed a combination of warmth and fresh air that cannot be obtained except\r\nin a building devoted to the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK-FACED SPIDER MONKEY.—_Page 259._]\r\n\r\nNext to the Reptile House the visitor will see another door, upon\r\nwhich is a placard calling attention to the Spider Monkeys. Passing up\r\na few stairs, we come to a room the centre of which is occupied by a\r\nmagnificent wire cage. In this cage are placed four specimens of the\r\nSpider Monkey, a few lemurs, and a single specimen of the Moustache\r\nMonkey, a creature which has been described at page 250 of our volume.\r\nThis little animal has been transferred to the Spider Monkeys’ cage for\r\nthe purpose of enlivening the normal inhabitants, who have a custom of\r\nsquatting together on the floor, winding their prehensile tails around\r\nthe general assemblage, and scolding every one who tries to disturb them.\r\n\r\nThere are three specimens of the Black-faced Spider Monkey (_Ateles\r\nfrontatus_), and one of the Greyish Spider Monkey (_Ateles hybridus_).\r\nThe latter animal can be at once recognised by the colour of its fur,\r\nwhich is of a very light and nearly white grey, the hair being rather\r\nlong and coarse. The others are all known by their darker colour, a\r\nblackish brown pervading their whole bodies, and their faces being\r\ndarker than the rest of their persons. One specimen of the Black-faced\r\nSpider Monkey is in excellent health and spirits, and seldom fails\r\nto afford its visitors the gratification of seeing it go through its\r\nwonderful performances.\r\n\r\nIt has a regular series of feats, and goes through them as systematically\r\nas if it were an acrobat performing before the public. First it climbs up\r\nthe wires until it has reached the longitudinal rafter that runs along\r\nthe top of the cage. Along this rafter it springs, holding only by its\r\nhands, and swings along, hand over hand, with a certainty and lightness\r\nthat are peculiarly beautiful.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the other end of the rafter it grasps a rope, launches\r\nitself into mid-air, swings once or twice, and then transfers itself to\r\na second rope, by means of which it swings diagonally across the cage,\r\nlands safely upon the wires, and then goes to rejoin its companions.\r\n\r\nWhen the four Spider Monkeys choose to gather themselves together,\r\nscarcely any inducement can separate them. By a very necessary rule, no\r\none is allowed to feed the creatures in this room, so that these monkeys\r\ncannot be enticed away from their companionship, and the cage is so\r\nlarge, that, even if ill-conditioned visitors were to attempt to use\r\nviolence, they could not succeed.\r\n\r\nI hope that the young observer will lose no time in proceeding to the\r\nZoological Gardens and examining the peculiarities of the Spider Monkeys,\r\nbecause all the quadrumana are delicate beings at the best, and these\r\nSouth American species are peculiarly affected by our climate.\r\n\r\nThe first point of importance in their structure is the long prehensile\r\ntail, the tip of which is bare of fur and covered with soft black skin,\r\nlike that of the feet. It can grasp with very great power, and the animal\r\npossesses the faculty of directing it as accurately as an elephant\r\ndirects its proboscis, so that it is able to seize the branches of the\r\ntree, or to pick up any object within reach. I was going to say that\r\nit can grasp the branches of the tree in which it _resides_, but this\r\nexpression would have been wrong. Monkeys have no residence; they are\r\nessentially nomad in their characters, traversing continually the rocks\r\nor forests of the country wherein they live, and neither needing nor\r\npossessing a fixed residence. The chief use of a definite habitation is\r\nto furnish a secure home for the young while they are helpless.\r\n\r\nThus, the rabbit retires to her burrow, the wolf or the lioness to her\r\nden, and the squirrel to her cage. But the young of the monkey are never\r\nhelpless, like those of the animals just mentioned; they cling to their\r\nmother’s body, bury themselves in her fur, and find therein a warm and\r\nliving cradle. It is noteworthy, too, that the young monkey suspends\r\nitself in such a manner that it offers no impediment to its mother’s\r\nmovements, nor does it interfere with her equilibrium as she passes along\r\nthe branches.\r\n\r\nThe next important point in these monkeys is the peculiar formation of\r\ntheir limbs. All monkeys are agile, but these creatures are especially\r\nmade for locomotion among branches, and in consequence they combine\r\nstrength and lightness in a very wonderful manner. Their heads are very\r\nsmall and round, their bodies are slight and of trifling weight, while\r\ntheir limbs are at once long, slender, and powerful.\r\n\r\nThe fore paws are small, and the observer must remark that the thumb\r\nis almost entirely absent. A monkey does not grasp with its fore paws,\r\nbut merely _hooks_ its fingers over the branches, and so swings without\r\nwasting its strength. The grasping power is chiefly evident in the hind\r\npaws, the thumb of which is very large, and therefore possesses great\r\nforce. The inner surface of the hind paws is quite black, soft, and\r\nsilken to the touch, and little indicative of the enormous grasping power\r\nwhich resides in them.\r\n\r\nAs instruments of terrestrial progression the limbs possess but few\r\ncapabilities. All monkeys have an awkward air while on the ground;\r\nbut these long-limbed creatures are peculiarly ill fitted to a level\r\nsurface. They can walk on their hind feet, and often do so, but it is in\r\na curious, waddling sort of gait, with the arms extended as balancers,\r\nand the long tail curved high over the head like the letter S.\r\n\r\nThey often proceed along the floor of their cage in a very curious\r\nmanner. Without changing their seated posture they gather up their legs,\r\nplace their hands on the floor, and swing themselves along, using the\r\narms as crutches. This movement is exactly like the mode of progression\r\nwhich has been related of the kangaroos in books of Natural History.\r\nAwkward as this manœuvre may seem, it suits them well enough, and they\r\nget along at a pace which really surprises those who see it for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe nostrils are very wide apart, on account of a thick cartilage which\r\ndivides them, and the teeth present many remarkable peculiarities, which\r\nneed not be described except in a purely scientific work.\r\n\r\n“I have elsewhere written an account of a Black Spider Monkey named\r\nSally, who, like the monkey in the fable, had seen the world, having\r\ntraversed the greater part of the globe by sea and by land. I afterwards\r\nmade her acquaintance, and was much pleased with her gentle manners.\r\n\r\n“She was terribly impatient of cold, and, when allowed to go near a fire,\r\nit was almost painful to see the eagerness with which she drank in the\r\nheat. She would hold up her arm, and expose her side to the fire until\r\nthe hair began to shrivel and scorch; she would then turn the other side,\r\nand repeat the process. She would lie strangely curled up on the flat\r\nplate of the kitchen fender, spin round and round, as if she were a joint\r\nto be roasted, and would cry piteously when removed from the pleasing\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n“She was fond of climbing to the shoulders of those whom she liked, and\r\nused to do so in rather a curious manner, not pulling herself up by\r\ngrasping the clothes, as is the custom with most monkeys, but by clasping\r\nthe limbs round the body. When she had reached the waist, she generally\r\nput her hand into every pocket, in order to feel for apples or nuts, and\r\ndisplayed little petulant signs of disapprobation when her search was\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\n“I regret to say that poor gentle Sally is dead. She had lived for years\r\non board ship, alike unaffected by tropical suns or Arctic snows, but\r\nthe peculiar British climate did not suit her constitution, and in a few\r\nmonths she succumbed to its influence.\r\n\r\n“The only signs of anger that I have known the Spider Monkeys to manifest\r\nis a slight shooting out of the lips, accompanied by a short, sharp,\r\nimpatient sound, something between a whistle and a squeak.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a smaller cage may be seen a beautiful specimen of the Squirrel\r\nMonkey, sometimes called the Tee-Tee (_Callithrix sciureus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUIRREL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUIRREL MONKEY AND TEE-TEE.—_Page 263._]\r\n\r\nThis pretty and elegant little creature is scarcely larger than a rat,\r\nwith an innocent, baby-like countenance, and large, full, dark eyes. It\r\nmay at once be recognised by the pink face with a blackish spot on the\r\nnose, and the yellow limbs, contrasting with the olive-coloured back. Its\r\ntail is exceedingly long and particularly prehensile, though I have not\r\nseen the creature suspend itself by that member, as is the case with the\r\nSpider Monkeys.\r\n\r\nIn common with all its kin, it is a most gentle and delicate little\r\nbeing—quite a lady’s pet—coming to the bars to be caressed, and\r\noccasionally uttering the tiniest imaginable squeaklet. It does not\r\npossess the selfish, grasping disposition which generally characterises\r\nthe monkey tribe. On one occasion the keeper gave two slices of orange\r\nto itself and the Douroucouli, which inhabits the same cage. Just as\r\nthe Douroucouli was about to take its piece of fruit, a sharp-eyed and\r\nquick-limbed Moustache Monkey, that inhabited an adjoining cage, leaped\r\nacross the top of its house, dropped along the wires, thrust its arm\r\nthrough the partition, and seized the orange, darting away with its spoil\r\nto the farther corner of its cage.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments I was amusing myself by laughing at the impertinent\r\nthief as he sat grinning and chattering defiance to the keeper, and when\r\nI turned to see how the Douroucouli bore his loss, I found the Tee-Tee\r\nquietly sharing his piece of orange with the bereaved animal. Both were\r\nnibbling and sucking away with perfect amity, and they resorted to the\r\nsame social expedient when another slice of the juicy fruit was put into\r\nthe cage.\r\n\r\nIn the same cage with the Tee-Tee is the curious Feline Douroucouli,\r\nor Vitoe (_Nyctipithecus felinus_), a pretty, though sober-coloured,\r\nlittle animal, mostly active during the night, but at times lively in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\nThe fur of this animal is thick, deep, and soft, though not drooping. It\r\nhas a round face, a short, stumpy nose, and very large round eyes of a\r\nbeautiful chestnut hue. The general colour of the fur is greyish-brown;\r\nthere is a dark stripe over the top of the head, and just above each eye\r\nis a patch of white. Its fingers are very long, and the tail is large,\r\nfull, and nearly black. This creature is found, as are all the tribe, in\r\nthe Brazils.\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime it spends much of its time in its box, which is long\r\nand narrow, with an aperture near each end, and the creature seems to\r\nfind some amusement in popping into one round hole, traversing the box,\r\nand poking its head out of the other. When a slice of orange was given\r\nto the Douroucouli, it did not attempt to eat it for some time, but\r\nonly patted it, and then licked its fingers, thus giving time to its\r\nneighbour, the Moustache Monkey, to rob it of the dainty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last of the true New World Monkeys which can be described in these\r\npages will be found in the large Monkey House near the refreshment-room.\r\nThese are the Capucins, (_Cebus Apella_), of which there are several\r\nspecimens in the cages. They are funny little animals, of a singularly\r\nsedate and grave aspect.\r\n\r\nTwo of them, called “Jack” and “Charley,” are notable for their\r\nnut-cracking powers. Their jaws are too feeble to break the shell of a\r\nwell-grown nut, and accordingly they have learned to achieve that object\r\nin another manner. Some time ago a very little monkey was placed in the\r\ncage quite unable to crack nutshells, and the keeper, taking compassion\r\non his weakness, showed him how to break a nutshell by means of a large\r\npebble. The other monkeys learned the art by watching their comrade, and\r\nit is very amusing to see one of them take a nut, put it into his mouth,\r\nhunt under the straw for the pebble, drop the nut on the floor, pick up\r\nthe stone in both hands, smash the shell with a single blow, and pick up\r\nthe fragments in haste, lest the others should avail themselves of his\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\nJack is also very fond of eggs, breaking one end by knocking it against\r\nthe floor, and then, inserting his hand, pulling out the semi-liquid\r\ncontents and eating them. For the benefit of those who read _Gulliver’s\r\nTravels_, I may mention that the monkey might have found little favour at\r\nthe court of H.M. Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue,\r\nEmperor of Liliput, being an obstinate Big-endian, and never breaking his\r\neggs at the little end.\r\n\r\nAs to Charley, he developed tastes that to me were rather unexpected.\r\nThe keeper put his hand into his pocket, and, drawing out a dead mouse,\r\npresented it to Charley, who received it with eagerness sparkling in\r\nhis eyes, and withdrew to the side of the cage, where he was nearly\r\nsurrounded by his fellows, who sat around him in eager expectation,\r\nwatching every movement, like small boys when one of their comrades has\r\nan apple.\r\n\r\nHis first operation was to put the head in his mouth, to bite the skull\r\nasunder with a single effort, and eat the brains. He then deliberated\r\nupon the mouse, pulled off a leg, and laid it on the ground, whence it\r\nwas instantly seized and eaten by a companion. He seemed anxious to make\r\nthe treat last as long as possible, and after a lapse of half-an-hour he\r\nhad not quite finished the mouse. The keeper told me that he preferred\r\nthem just killed.\r\n\r\nBy some writers these monkeys are called Weepers. The colour of the\r\nCapucin is rather variable: yellowish with an olive cast on the back, and\r\npaler round the face.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAGASCAR MONKEYS.\r\n\r\nIn the wonderful island known by the name of Madagascar are several\r\nmembers of the quadrumanous order, none of which are very like monkeys,\r\nand one is so strange a being, that, for many years, systematic\r\nzoologists did not know in which order it ought to be placed. In the same\r\nroom with the Spider Monkeys is a cage in which are placed two very fine\r\nspecimens of the Ring-tailed Lemur, or Macauco (_Lemur catta_). These\r\nhandsome creatures are very tame and gentle, and always grateful for a\r\nlittle attention.\r\n\r\nThey are very pretty creatures, with their long snouts, full chestnut\r\neyes, large, intelligent ears, and soft chinchilla-like fur. Their\r\ngeneral colour is soft and slightly mottled grey, blackish upon the\r\ntop of the head, taking a warmer tint upon the back, and becoming pure\r\nwhite below. The tail is very long and round, nearly white, and ringed\r\nregularly with black throughout its length.\r\n\r\nThey are playful as kittens, and have great games in their cage, knocking\r\neach other over, leaping about their house with wonderful activity, and\r\nexpressing amusement by jumping up and down from all the four paws, just\r\nas a kitten does when she is greatly excited. One of them will swing by\r\nits hind paws from a branch, give its companion a pat on the side of the\r\nhead, drop to the floor, and scurry off in hot haste, with its playfellow\r\nin full chase. Suddenly it pulls up and sits on a branch, with its hind\r\nfeet clasping the bough and its tail swinging loosely below, and calmly\r\ncontemplates the prospect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RING-TAILED LEMUR.—_Page 266._]\r\n\r\nThey took a great fancy to my pencil, and tried very hard to obtain it,\r\ndropping suddenly along the wires, and making a dash at the pencil when\r\nthey thought that I was off my guard. Owing to the slenderness of their\r\nlimbs, they can thrust their paws to a surprising distance through the\r\nbars. They became greatly excited when I offered them some bread, jumping\r\nabout, and uttering curious little murmuring cries. Each tried very hard\r\nto monopolise the dainty, but, when they found out that each had its\r\nproper share, they grew contented with their gift.\r\n\r\nTheir paws are quite as hand-like as those of the true monkeys; and\r\nwhen the creature sits upright, feeding itself with its fingers, and\r\nlooking calmly in various directions, it assumes a peculiarly wise and\r\ncontemplative aspect. The fore paws are quite soft and rounded at their\r\ntips, being finished off with a round black pad, which projects from\r\nbeyond the little blunt nails, so that the Lemur is quite unable to\r\nscratch, though it can snatch and clutch quickly, and pull with great\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nI have much more to say about these beautiful animals, but, as we shall\r\nrequire some space for the description of the Aye Aye, I must pass to the\r\nremaining specimens of the Lemur tribe.\r\n\r\nIn a smaller cage is a specimen of the White-fronted Lemur (_Lemur\r\nalbifrons_), a creature that at the time of my visit had hardly made\r\nup its mind whether it would be playful or vicious. After some little\r\nexperience it found out that I meant it no harm, and so took up the\r\nformer line of conduct.\r\n\r\nBy degrees it organised a kind of game, and would play as long as I\r\nchose to humour it. The creature turned its back to me, and pressed\r\nitself against the side of the cage. I gave it a poke with my finger\r\nor pencil, and the Lemur gave a kind of chatter, dashed to the top of\r\nthe cage, laid the side of its head upon the bars, opened its mouth,\r\nsqueaked, and then descended to resume its game. Like its ring-tailed\r\nkinsfolk, it took a fancy to my pencil, and once or twice nearly\r\nsucceeded in pulling it out of my hand.\r\n\r\nThe general colour of this species is brown, with a warmer tinge upon\r\nthe sides, and round the face is a ruff of long, loose white hair, that\r\ngives the creature an aspect not at all unlike that of a pantaloon\r\nin a Christmas pantomime. I may mention that by many zoologists the\r\nWhite-fronted Lemur is thought to be only the female of the Black-fronted\r\nLemur (_Lemur nigrifrons_).\r\n\r\nIn a corresponding cage is a specimen of the White-whiskered Lemur\r\n(_Lemur leucomystax_).\r\n\r\nThis animal has lived in the collection for nearly two years, and\r\nis quite tame and gentle. It is rather larger than the preceding\r\nspecies, and is a very pretty creature. The fur is long, soft, and of a\r\nreddish-brown colour upon the body, taking a black hue on the top of the\r\nhead. Instead of the ruff of white hair that surrounds the head of the\r\npreceding species, there is a pointed tuft of white hair projecting from\r\neach cheek, just like the whiskers of an old man.\r\n\r\nIt is fond of being caressed, and, when no one takes notice, it attempts\r\nto call their attention by uttering a short grunt, frequently repeated,\r\nand sometimes gives vent to its impatience by a rather loud and deep\r\nbarking sound. The observer should be careful to examine the eyes of the\r\nLemur, their peculiar lustre having at times almost a startling effect,\r\ntheir depths seeming to be lighted up with a silvery fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last of the monkey tribe.\r\n\r\nJust now the Zoological Society is rich in treasures, possessing some\r\nof the rarest birds and quadrupeds at present known to science. The\r\nhippopotamus, for example, though not scarce in its own country, is so\r\ndifficult a subject for transmission, that we may congratulate ourselves\r\non the two magnificent specimens in the Gardens. The giraffe, too,\r\npartakes of similar conditions, and is, therefore, most valuable. But\r\nperhaps the two most remarkable creatures at present in the Gardens are\r\nthe apteryx, a bird which is undoubtedly on the road to extinction, and\r\nis notable for laying an egg that weighs one-fourth as much as the mother\r\nbird; and the Aye Aye (_Cheiromys Madagascariensis_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AYE-AYE.—_Page 269._]\r\n\r\nThis wonderful animal derives its name from the exclamations of surprise\r\nuttered by some natives of Madagascar when the creature was first shown\r\nto them. It is eminently nocturnal in its habits, and on account of its\r\ndark fur and quiet movements is not likely to attract observation. It\r\nwas first discovered by Sonnerat, who kept a couple of specimens for\r\nsome time, feeding them upon boiled rice. They fed themselves in a very\r\ncurious manner, using the long slender fingers of the fore paws for the\r\npurpose of conveying the food to the mouth.\r\n\r\nA single dead specimen was brought to France by the discoverer, and the\r\nstuffed skin placed in the splendid museum in Paris; and for many years\r\nthis was the only specimen in Europe. The accounts of the habits of the\r\nanimal were exceedingly meagre; nothing was known of its customs when in\r\na state of freedom, and the only trustworthy information which could be\r\nobtained was that which described the colour of the fur.\r\n\r\nWe hope now to gain more extended knowledge respecting the Aye Aye.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August, 1862, a fine female Aye Aye landed in England. She\r\nwas in a delicate state of health, for on the voyage she had produced a\r\nyoung one, which only survived its birth for a short time. However, by\r\nmeans of careful treatment she soon improved in health, and is now in\r\nvery fine condition.\r\n\r\nBy day she does not appear to the best advantage. She hates daylight,\r\nand very much resents its unwelcome intrusion upon her privacy, curling\r\nherself up in the darkest corner of the cage, and shading her face with\r\nher magnificent black tail. She is a stronger creature than might be\r\nsupposed from her dimensions, and displays much muscular power in pushing\r\nher way into her house.\r\n\r\nAs she lies in repose the enormous bushy tail is curled round and laid\r\nover the face, so that barely any outline is perceptible. It is curious\r\nto see how, even in this condition, the large ears are gently moved\r\nat every sound, and when the creature is roused from her torpor the\r\nbrilliancy with which the eyes gleam from among the heavy fur of the tail\r\nis really remarkable.\r\n\r\nAt night, however, the Aye Aye becomes a different being. She moves about\r\nwith ease and agility, making no rapid or sudden rushes, but quietly\r\nwalking about the cage, being perfectly indifferent as to the position\r\nin which the body may be. She can walk steadily upon the smooth floor,\r\nshe can walk upon the rough branches of the tree which is laid across her\r\ncage, or she can walk along the roof of her house, hanging suspended like\r\nthe sloth. And she appears to be equally at ease in either attitude, and\r\nwalks with equal adroitness.\r\n\r\nAs to the food of the Aye Aye, it may safely be pronounced to be of a\r\nmixed animal and vegetable character. Until this specimen was brought to\r\nEngland, the Aye Aye was thought to feed only on insects, the long third\r\nfinger being supposed to be used in taking them out of the recesses of\r\nthe rough bark. The specimen, however, which is at present living in the\r\nZoological Gardens totally rejects insects of every kind, and feeds only\r\non a mixture of honey, milk, and the yolk of hard-boiled eggs, beaten up\r\ninto the consistence of thick cream.\r\n\r\nThe mode of feeding is very peculiar. Mr. Bartlett, who has paid much\r\nattention to this zoological treasure, has published in the Proceedings\r\nof the Zoological Society a very interesting paper on the habits of the\r\nanimal, and gives the following description of its mode of feeding:—\r\n\r\n“In feeding, the left hand only is used, although she has the full use of\r\nher right one. The mode of taking her food requires careful attention, in\r\nconsequence of the very rapid movement of the hand during the process.\r\nThe fourth finger, which is the longest and largest, is thrust forwards\r\ninto the food, the slender third finger is raised upwards and backwards\r\nabove the rest, while the first finger or thumb is lowered so as to\r\nbe seen below and behind the chin. In this position the hand is drawn\r\nbackwards and forwards rapidly, the inner side of the fourth finger\r\npassing between the lips, the head of the animal being held sideways,\r\nthus depositing the food in the mouth at each movement; the tongue, jaws,\r\nand lips are kept in full motion all the time. Sometimes the animal will\r\nadvance towards, and lap from, the dish like a cat; but this is unusual.”\r\nThe keeper tells me, however, that, though she generally prefers the left\r\npaw for feeding herself, she frequently employs the right hand for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThese observations are very valuable, and, when taken in connection with\r\ncertain habits of the animal, lead us to suppose that in the wild state\r\nits mode of feeding is as unique as its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe observer will see that the branches within its cage are cut about\r\nas if they had been exposed to the fire of a rifle company, the boughs\r\nbeing deeply wounded and grooved, with splinters projecting in various\r\ndirections. These wounds are made by the teeth of the Aye Aye, which,\r\nthough no larger than a fine cat, possess strength of jaw and sharpness\r\nof tooth sufficient to inflict such wounds. It has been suggested that\r\nthe creature partially feeds on the sap of certain trees, and that by\r\nwounding their substance with its teeth it causes the juices to flow,\r\nand then conveys them into its mouth by means of the long fourth finger.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bartlett well observes, “I observe that our specimen returns\r\nfrequently to the same spot on the tree which she had previously injured.\r\nI am also strengthened in my opinion by noticing the little attention\r\npaid by the animal to the food. It does not watch or look after it; for I\r\nhave on several occasions removed the vessel containing its food during\r\nthe time the animal was feeding, and the creature continued to thrust its\r\nhand forward as before on the same spot; though, after awhile, finding no\r\nmore food, she discontinued, and moved off in search for more elsewhere.\r\nThis apparently stupid act is so unlike the habits of an animal intended\r\nto capture or feed on living creatures, that I am inclined to believe\r\nthat the Aye Aye feeds upon inanimate substances. I have frequently seen\r\nit eat a portion of the bark and wood, after taking a quantity of the\r\nfluid food.”\r\n\r\nShe also uses her slender fingers in cleaning her face and ears, and in\r\ncombing out the long hairs of her beautiful tail.\r\n\r\nThe animal nature of its food is proved by the observations of the Hon.\r\nH. Sandwith, M.D., &c., who kept a fine male Aye Aye for some time, and\r\ncarefully watched its habits.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the animal was constantly using its powerful teeth for the\r\npurpose of gnawing its way out of the cage, Dr. Sandwith thought that he\r\nwould put some branches in the cage, so that it might eat them instead of\r\ngnawing the woodwork of its habitation. After the sun had set, the Aye\r\nAye came from his darkened nest, and straightway proceeded to examine the\r\nbranches, which happened to have been bored by a large grub.\r\n\r\nThen was seen the use of the strange second finger, which is not half as\r\nthick as any of the others, and, indeed, looks more like a piece of bent\r\nwire than a jointed member. With this finger the animal tapped rapidly on\r\nthe bough, and then listened, as if to judge by the sound whether the\r\nbranch was tenanted. Having satisfied himself on this point, and having\r\nseveral times thrust his finger, probe fashion, into the holes, he began\r\nto bite away the wood with great energy, and in a few minutes succeeded\r\nin exposing a large grub, which was picked out of its hole by the same\r\nuseful finger, and so put into the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe animal would also eat mangoes, dates, and similar fruit, biting a\r\nhole in the rind, and scooping out the interior with the ever-useful\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nThe visitor should, if possible, obtain a view of the teeth, which are\r\nsufficiently powerful to bite through the hardest woods, such as ebony or\r\nteak—woods which woefully try the temper of our steel-made tools. In the\r\nfront of the jaw there are four incisor teeth, chisel-shaped, like those\r\nof the rabbit and other rodents, but of enormous depth and thickness.\r\nLike the rodent teeth, they are furnished with a pulpy substance at their\r\nroot, from which fresh tooth-substance is developed, so as to supply new\r\ntooth from behind as fast as it is worn away in front. They are arranged\r\nin a rather curious fashion, so that, when seen directly in front, they\r\nlook like four rounded points converging towards each other, and really\r\ngive no conception of their formidable powers.\r\n\r\nBetween the incisor and the grinder teeth there is a large gap, just as\r\nin the rodent tribes, and the skull is arched exactly like that of a rat\r\nor rabbit, in order to afford room for the large incisor teeth. There are\r\nno canine teeth, and altogether the number of teeth is only eighteen. The\r\nmuscles which move the jaws are powerful in proportion to the work which\r\nthey have to perform, and, to a considerable extent, cause the peculiar\r\nwidth of the head.\r\n\r\nThose who are unable to see the animal itself will be able to form a very\r\ncorrect idea from Mr. Wolfe’s admirable drawing, which is hung by the\r\ncage. No previous figures gave a true idea of the animal’s real shape,\r\nas they were necessarily sketched from the stuffed specimen, and, of\r\ncourse, looked shrivelled and death-like.\r\n\r\nThe Aye Aye is about the size of a large cat, and its face is full,\r\nwide, and rather destitute of hair. The upper part of the face is dull\r\nflesh-colour, which changes to pink upon the muzzle. The general colour\r\nis dull black, the hair being very long, rather scanty, and decidedly\r\ncoarse. Upon the back many of the hairs become quite white towards the\r\nextremities, and have a very fine effect when contrasted with the sober\r\nblack of the general fur. The tail is deep black and large, like that\r\nof a fox, but the hairs are arranged in a different manner, as may be\r\nseen from the illustration. Whenever the animal is angry, and spreads\r\nits tail, the hairs are seen to be grey at the base, and black as they\r\napproach the tips.\r\n\r\nThe ears are very large, black, and nearly hairless, but studded with\r\nlittle knobs; and the eyes are very large, very full, and of a beautiful\r\nchestnut colour. The fingers are very long and slender, and are held in\r\na curious kind of clutching attitude, as is shown in the illustration.\r\nWhen the face is seen directly in front, two of the teeth gleam whitely\r\nbetween the lips, and if the animal should chance to yawn their\r\nformidable arrangement becomes visible, and it is easy to see how deeply\r\nthey can bite into the tree.\r\n\r\nThe keeper seems to be on very good terms with the animal, which he calls\r\n“Jack” in bold defiance of her sex.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that we may obtain a male specimen of the Aye Aye, and\r\nthat they may breed in this country, as has been the case with many rare\r\nanimals, inhabitants of hotter climes. There is, however, a considerable\r\ndifficulty in obtaining specimens, even when we know where to look for\r\nthem; for the Aye Aye can only be detected by the watchful eye of the\r\nnative, who has from his childhood been taught to reverence the Aye Aye\r\nas something supernatural, and to fancy that, if he should touch one\r\nof these animals, even by chance, he will die within a year. There are\r\nbut few natives who are strong-minded enough to put themselves in such\r\ndanger, and even those who are daring enough to seize an Aye Aye require\r\nto have their courage stimulated by a very large bribe—enough, in fact,\r\nto maintain them through the entire year of peril.\r\n\r\nI have written at some length of this wonderful animal, because it is the\r\nfirst living specimen which has ever touched the European shores, and no\r\none can say how long it will live. There are, however, many curious and\r\ninteresting details of its structure which I cannot mention for lack of\r\nspace. If the reader should desire to make himself master of the anatomy\r\nof the Aye Aye, he will find a vast fund of information in Professor\r\nOwen’s monograph upon this creature.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER ACCOUNT OF THE AYE AYE.\r\n\r\n“Aye Aye!” So exclaimed the natives of the east coast of Madagascar, when\r\nfirst shown the little animal described above. But the exclamation was\r\nnot of affirmation, but astonishment; for they had never seen it before,\r\nand indeed there are reasons for thinking it is confined to the other\r\nside of that great continental island, which is so little known, yet in\r\nwhich Christianity has long numbered its devotees, its martyrs, and its\r\napostates.\r\n\r\n“But,” says some reader, whose tastes lead him to politics, poetry, or\r\nfiction, rather than to Nature, and whose acquaintance with the latter\r\nis limited to the creatures which he may eat or be eaten by—“even if I\r\ndid care to know anything at all about this little beast, with the head\r\nof a cat, the tail of a squirrel, the hands of a miser, and the feet of\r\na monkey, all I have to do is to glance at my _Beeton’s Dictionary_, and\r\nfind in a nutshell all about the Aye Aye.”\r\n\r\nBut there is more to be said about the Aye Aye than can be contained in\r\na scientific dictionary, and as to _Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary_,\r\nwe pray our readers to listen for a single moment to the following\r\nstatement, which is made with great regret, since we too once had equal\r\nfaith in the magnificent work above mentioned. The figure named Aye\r\nAye, upon page 99, would answer equally well for at least a dozen other\r\nmammiferous vertebrates, and no one who has ever seen a correct picture\r\nof the Aye Aye would recognise this as meant for one; the description\r\nof its appearance and habits, though equal in length to that of the\r\nelephant, is incorrect in several important points, and neither the\r\nfigure nor the description affords any information respecting the real\r\npeculiarities which distinguish the Aye Aye from all known animals.\r\nIt is true that similar defects exist in the account given in Wood’s\r\n_Illustrated Natural History of Mammalia_; and there is some excuse for\r\nthis as in the dictionary, since both were issued before the appearance\r\nof Professor Owen’s splendid _Monograph of the Aye Aye_, in 1866; but\r\nneither this nor any other excuse can be urged for the deficiencies and\r\nmisstatements of certain late text-books of zoology.\r\n\r\nWe trust this is sufficient reason for offering now some further account\r\nof the Aye Aye.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the name. Its origin is as stated above, and not from any\r\nsound made by the creature itself; for, although one observer states\r\nthat it sometimes utters a low grunt, another, the Superintendent of\r\nthe Zoological Gardens in London, says he has never heard it make any\r\nsound whatever. Now it could not be expected that scientific naturalists\r\nwould rest content with so brief a title as Aye Aye for so wonderful\r\nan animal. It must have two names at the least—the first to designate\r\nits genus, the second to signify the species, just as we say sugar\r\n(genus), white or brown, &c., (species); so in 1790 the Aye Aye was\r\ncalled Sciurus (squirrel) Madagascariensis (native of Madagascar). In\r\n1800 it was rechristened as Lemur (ghost) psilodactylus (long-fingered).\r\nBut it is now generally known by the title bestowed by Cuvier—Chiromys\r\nMadagascariensis—which signifies “a rat-like animal with hands, and\r\nliving in Madagascar.”\r\n\r\nThe scientific title of the Aye Aye, then, fully atones for the brevity\r\nof its common name; and it must be further remembered that the technical\r\nnames of animals and plants bear no definite relation to their own size\r\nor importance; for example, the elephant is simply Elephas Indicus\r\nor Africanus, according to the species, while the little changeable\r\nmole of the Cape of Good Hope is called Chrysochloris holosericea, and\r\na microscopic rhizopod shell rejoices in the high-sounding title of\r\nQuinquenoculina meridionalis. Even this, however, would not be so bad if\r\neach species bore but a single name instead of a dozen, as often happens,\r\nand if, on the other hand, the same names were not sometimes by mistake\r\napplied to totally distinct species. It has been well said that the zeal\r\nof zoologists to give names to species and groups is the greatest bane of\r\nNatural History, a constant hindrance to our own progress, and a subject\r\nof well-deserved reproach from the public; if we would all make it a\r\nrule not to publish the name of a supposed new species for a year after\r\nits discovery, and until a thorough search had been made for previous\r\nrecords, our own glory might be less apparent, but we should be more\r\nconsiderate of our fellows, and more surely, though more slowly, advance\r\nthe knowledge of natural objects.\r\n\r\nThe Aye Aye is about the size of a cat, but the head is rather larger,\r\nthe ears are wider and less pointed, the limbs project more freely from\r\nthe trunk, and the bushy tail forms rather more than half the total\r\nlength of three feet. This tail, moreover, has a gentle downward curve,\r\ninstead of an upward tendency, as with the cat and the dog. The trunk is\r\nclothed with a silky coat of short greyish hair; but the colour is given\r\nby the longer hairs, which are dark brown or nearly black, although along\r\nthe spine some of them are tipped with white.\r\n\r\nSo far the Aye Aye has presented nothing very wonderful; but a glance\r\nat our illustration will detect its most striking feature. The Aye Aye’s\r\nhand is unlike that of any other known animal. Its medius or middle digit\r\nis about as long as the annularis or ring finger, but _only half as\r\nthick_. It is skinny and bony, as if stricken with palsy, and has been\r\naptly compared to a crooked nail. Its knuckle-joint is projected beyond\r\nthose of the other digits; its first phalanx is longer than that of any\r\nexcepting the annularis, and its terminal phalanges very slender. But\r\nthe tendon of the medius is quite as large as those of the other digits;\r\nand we are told that the tendons and muscles are so arranged that great\r\npower may be exerted upon this one slender digit, for a purpose we shall\r\npresently describe. The pollex, or thumb, is the shortest and thickest of\r\nall—has one less phalanx, as is usual among the mammalia, and is armed\r\nwith a claw like the others. The acute angle which it forms with the palm\r\ndoes not indicate any great degree of opposability.\r\n\r\nThe hinder foot (pes) reminds us at once of that of a monkey; for the\r\nprimus, or great toe, stands out boldly from the side of the foot, and is\r\nevidently opposed in grasping to the other four dactyls, as is our thumb.\r\nIt bears a small nail, whereas the four smaller dactyls are armed with\r\ncurved and pointed claws. Both digits and dactyls, moreover, are a little\r\nthickened at the tip, so as to form fleshy pads. That of the primus is\r\nmost apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Aye Aye has strange teeth, too; for some of them suggest the\r\nsquirrel, and others the monkey. In the first place, it has only two\r\nfront or incisor teeth, above and below, and these are narrow, but deep,\r\nand bevelled off to a cutting edge, like the incisor teeth of the beaver,\r\nthe squirrel, the rabbit, and other “rodentia” or gnawing animals, which\r\nhave a hard case of enamel upon the front surface, the rest of the tooth\r\nbeing softer and more easily worn away by use. These teeth are like\r\nchisels in this respect; but they have two very decided advantages over\r\nthe best steel instrument of human contrivance. The first is, that\r\ntheir very use keeps them sharp and in perfect order, since the edge of\r\nthe lower tooth strikes just behind the edge of the upper, and both are\r\ncontinually worn away behind by the attrition of the hard wood which they\r\nattack. The second peculiarity is, that this constant loss of substance\r\nat the free end of the tooth is constantly _repaired by new growth at the\r\nopposite extremity_. The tooth grows during the life of the animal; and\r\nas the crown is worn away, the addition of fresh material to the root\r\npushes the whole tooth slowly forward in its long socket, and it is thus\r\never ready for use. These ever-growing teeth are organic chisels which\r\nare for ever in use, yet never in need of the grindstone—for ever wearing\r\naway, yet never worn out.\r\n\r\nBut while the scalpriform incisors so nearly resemble those of the real\r\nrodent mammals, and while this resemblance is further increased by the\r\nabsence of any canine or eye-teeth, and by the provision for a sliding\r\nforward and backward movement of the lower jaw, yet the molar or grinding\r\nteeth differ from those of the typical rodents; their crowns are rounded\r\nand slightly tuberculous, like those of the pigs, the monkeys, and man,\r\nand do not seem adapted to a strictly vegetable diet; add to this the\r\npeculiar character of the ears, which are large and naked, like the\r\nbat’s, and are inclined forward as if for offensive purposes, rather than\r\nbackward, like the hare’s, in order to warn it of pursuit, and we must\r\nevidently be cautious in drawing conclusions as to the manner of life and\r\nthe zoological affinities of this singular animal. The limbs show that it\r\nclimbs trees like a monkey, the eyes that it is active at dusk like the\r\nowl and the cat, the teeth that it gnaws wood like the squirrel, while\r\nthe internal organs of digestion would lead us to suppose that it feeds\r\nupon insects; and the extraordinary middle digit is so utterly unlike\r\nanything we have seen before, that conjecture as to its purpose seems to\r\nbe in vain.\r\n\r\nDeferring a discussion as to the Aye Aye’s place in a system of animals,\r\nand confining ourselves to what we have learned of its structure, let us\r\nsee how nearly correct the reader has been in any surmises as to its mode\r\nof existence by consulting the statements of those who have observed the\r\nAye Aye in life.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was the traveller Sonnerat, whose _Voyage aux Indes\r\nOrientales et à la Chine, depuis 1774 jusqu’en 1781_, was published at\r\nParis in 1782. He appears to have been the first civilised discoverer\r\nof the Aye Aye, and states, either from his own observation or from the\r\nreports of the natives, that “it makes use of the long, slender and\r\nnaked middle digit to draw out of holes in trees the worms which form\r\nits food.” Sonnerat had a male and a female Aye Aye which lived for two\r\nmonths on board ship, being fed with rice.\r\n\r\nThe next recorded observation upon the habits of the Aye Aye was\r\ncommunicated to the French Academy of Sciences in 1855, by M. Liénard,\r\nof the Mauritius. He states that when a mango-fruit was offered, the Aye\r\nAye first made a hole in the rind with his strong front teeth, inserted\r\ntherein his slender middle digit, and then, lowering his mouth to the\r\nhole, put into it the pulp which the finger had scooped out of the fruit.\r\nA third observer, M. A. Vinson, states that in the same year an Aye Aye\r\ndrank _café au lait_ or _eau sucrée_ by passing its long and slender\r\ndigit from the vessel to its mouth with incredible rapidity.\r\n\r\nBut in 1859 Dr. H. Sandwith, the Colonial Secretary from England to the\r\nMauritius, wrote to Professor Owen that he had secured a fine, healthy\r\nadult male Aye Aye from Madagascar, which, after having once escaped and\r\nbeen recaptured, was put into spirit and sent to England. This specimen\r\nformed the subject of a most complete and suggestive work of the learned\r\nProfessor. But a long communication from Dr. Sandwith himself is printed\r\nin the Society’s Proceedings for 1859, and some observations upon the\r\nhabits of a female Aye Aye which reached the Society’s collection in\r\nAugust, 1862, are printed in the Society’s Proceedings for that year, and\r\nin the _Annals of Natural History_, vol. xii.\r\n\r\nFrom these various sources we learn the following as to the Aye Aye’s\r\nmode of life:—\r\n\r\nDuring the day the Aye Aye sleeps; it then lies upon one side, with the\r\nbody curved and nearly covered by the great bushy tail. It is sensitive\r\nto cold, and sometimes covers itself with a piece of flannel, even in\r\nwarm weather.\r\n\r\nAt dusk it awakes and climbs about, securely grasping the branches with\r\nits prehensile feet, and often hanging suspended by them, and using its\r\nfingers as a comb for its long tail. In this operation the middle digit\r\nis especially serviceable, and it is also used in clearing dust from its\r\nface and other parts, the other digits being then often partially closed.\r\nIt was found that the captive Aye Aye in the Zoological Gardens used only\r\nthe _left_ hand in feeding from a dish, although the right seemed equally\r\nat its command.\r\n\r\nThe fourth digit (_annularis_), which is the longest and largest, is\r\nthrust forward into the food, the slender medius raised upward and\r\nbackward above the rest, while the pollex is lowered so as to be seen\r\nbelow and behind the chin. In this position (an almost impossible one,\r\nby the way, for men or monkeys) the hand is drawn backward and forward\r\nrapidly, the inner side of the finger passing between the lips, the head\r\nof the animal being held sideways, thus depositing the food in the mouth\r\nat each movement; the tongue, jaws, and lips are kept in full motion all\r\nthe time. Sometimes the animal will lap from the dish like a cat, but\r\nthis is unusual. During all the hours in which the Superintendent of the\r\nGardens watched it, no sound was made, nor was there any manifestation of\r\nanger or shyness.\r\n\r\nThis specimen seemed to care nothing for insects, but fed freely upon\r\na mixture of milk, honey, eggs, and such sweet and glutinous things,\r\nand the observer concluded, therefore, that its natural food is rather\r\nfruit than insects; but this only indicated that the Aye Aye did not like\r\nBritish meal-worms, grasshoppers, wasp-larvæ, and the like, and no more\r\nproved that it was not insectivorous than a man’s refusal to eat turnips\r\nwould show that he cared nothing for potatoes. And surely nothing can be\r\nmore conclusive than the following account which Dr. Sandwith gives of\r\nthe proceedings of his specimen:—\r\n\r\n“I found he would eat bananas and dates; and he drank by dipping a finger\r\ninto the water and drawing it through his mouth so rapidly that the water\r\nseemed to flow in a stream; after a while he lapped like a cat, but the\r\nformer was the more usual method, and seemed to be his way of reaching\r\nwater in the clefts of the trees.\r\n\r\n“I happened to put into his cage some thick sticks, which were bored in\r\nall directions by a large and destructive grub called the ‘Moutouk.’ Just\r\nat sunset the Aye Aye crept from under his blanket, yawned, stretched,\r\nand betook himself to his tree, where his movements are lively and\r\ngraceful, though by no means so quick as those of a squirrel. Presently\r\nhe came to one of the worm-eaten branches, which he began to examine most\r\nattentively; and, bending forward his ears and applying his nose close to\r\nthe bark, he rapidly tapped the surface with the curious middle digit, as\r\na woodpecker taps a tree, though with much less noise, from time to time\r\ninserting the end of the slender finger into the wormholes, as a surgeon\r\nwould a probe. At length he came to a part of the branch which evidently\r\ngave out an interesting sound, for he began to tear it with his strong\r\nteeth; he rapidly stripped off the bark, cut into the wood, and exposed\r\nthe nest of a grub, which he daintily picked out of its bed with the\r\nslender, tapering finger, and conveyed to his mouth.”\r\n\r\nThis medius, then, can be used in turn as a pleximeter, a probe, and a\r\nscoop; and not the least remarkable circumstance is the coincidence\r\nbetween the diameter of the hole made in the wood by the incisor teeth\r\nand the width of this digit; for although we cannot say that the size\r\nand power of the head are such as to limit the width of the teeth, yet,\r\ngranting that their size is so limited, it is evident that none of the\r\nordinary digits would be of the least service as an instrument of either\r\ndiscovery or extraction; and whatever view we may adopt as to the means\r\nby which these structures were produced, we must surely, with the great\r\nanatomist, recognise not only “the direct adaptation of instruments to\r\nfunctions, of feet to grasp, of teeth to erode, of a digit to feel and\r\nto extract, but we discern a correlation of these several modifications\r\nwith each other, and with modifications of the nervous system and\r\nsense-organs—of eyes to catch the least glimmer of light, and of ears\r\nto detect the feeblest grating of sound—the whole forming a compound\r\nmechanism to the perfect performance of a particular kind of work.” The\r\nAye Aye obviously belongs to the branch of Vertebrates and the class of\r\nMammalia; but some zoologists have placed it with the squirrels in the\r\norder Rodentia, and others with the Lemurs, in the order Quadrumana or\r\nCheiropoda; there is also a certain superficial resemblance to a cat;\r\nbut the real issue has been between those who follow Buffon and Cuvier\r\nin giving prominence to the ever-growing incisor teeth, which agree with\r\nthose of the rodents, and those who, like Schreber and De Blainville,\r\nregard the limbs as of more importance, and point out their resemblance\r\nto those of monkeys.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally conceded that Professor Owen’s researches have\r\ndecided the question in favour of the latter view, for he shows that the\r\nonly rodent features are the teeth, and similar ever-growing incisors are\r\nfound in at least one other mammal, the marsupial wombat, which no one\r\nhas thought of calling a rodent: on the contrary, the hair, the tail, the\r\nform of the head and body, the length of the intestines, the heart and\r\nblood-vessels, the brain, and the limbs tend to separate the Aye Aye\r\nfrom the rodents, and to join it with the Cheiropoda; and although the\r\nextraordinary middle digit has no fellow in the whole animal kingdom,\r\nyet this modification of the terminal segment of a limb is another\r\nlink between the Aye Aye and that lowest family of the Cheiropoda, the\r\nLemuridæ, which, like it, are mostly natives of Madagascar, and, besides\r\nbeing nocturnal in their habits, whence the name Lemures (ghosts),\r\nare also distinguished from all other mammals and from each other by\r\npeculiar, and, at present, unaccountable modifications of the fingers and\r\nthe toes. In one species the forefinger is as if amputated; in another a\r\nsingle toe bears a claw, while the others bear nails; and in a third, two\r\ntoes are thus provided with claws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKEY LEGENDS AND ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKEY LEGENDS AND ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n    “A wilderness of Monkeys.”\r\n\r\n                  MERCHANT OF VENICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Broderip, in his _Zoological Recreations_, tells us that\r\nMazurier, after a long and patient attendance upon the monkeys domiciled\r\nin the _Jardin du Roi_, sewed up in skins, and with a face painted and\r\nmade up in a concatenation accordingly, raised at last the benevolence\r\nof a tender-hearted one to such a pitch, that it offered him a bit of\r\nthe apple it was eating, and drew from him that rapturous exclamation,\r\npregnant with the consciousness of his apparent identity with the\r\nmonkey-character—“Enfin! enfin, je suis singe!”—(At length! at length, I\r\nhave become a monkey.)\r\n\r\nPoor Mazurier! when he died, _Polichinelle_ was shipwrecked indeed! We\r\ncan see him now gaily advancing, as if Prometheus had just touched the\r\nwood with his torch, in a brilliant cocked hat of gilt and silvered\r\npasteboard, with rosettes to match, gallantly put on athwart ships;\r\nthat very pasteboard, so dear to recollection as having glittered\r\nbefore our delighted eyes when old nurse unfolded the familiar little\r\nbooks of lang-syne—books which in these philosophical days are shorn\r\nof their beams; for _Cock Robin_, _Little Red Riding Hood_, _Jack and\r\nhis Bean-stalk_, _The Children in the Wood_, _The Seven Champions_,\r\n_Valentine and Orson_, with the other dearly-beloved legends of our\r\nchildhood, when permitted to enter the nursery, are more soberly clad:\r\ntheir splendid and many-coloured attractive coats have almost entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nMazurier was the personification of that invincible Prince of Roués,\r\nPunch; but if the comic strength of this elastic, this indian-rubber\r\nman lays in Polichinelle, it was in _The Ape of Brazil_ that his tragic\r\npower lay—and that power, absurd as the expression may seem to those who\r\nnever beheld him, was great. There was but one blot in his inimitable\r\nperformance. It was perfect as a piece of acting; but, alas! Mazurier\r\nhad dressed the character without a tail. The melodrama was admirably\r\ngot up; but there, to the great distress of zoologists, was the tailless\r\nquadrumane in the midst of Brazilian scenery, where no traveller—and\r\ntravellers are proverbial for seeing strange things—has ever ventured to\r\nsay that he saw a monkey without that dignifying appendage. How true is\r\nit that wisdom—such wisdom as it is—brings sorrow; all the rest of the\r\nworld were in ecstasies; the zoologists shook their heads, and the scene\r\nceased to affect them.\r\n\r\nBe it remembered henceforth by the getters-up of monkey melodramas, that\r\nall the monkeys of the New World yet discovered rejoice in tails; the\r\nanthropoid apes of the Old World have none.\r\n\r\nBut tailed or tailless, this amusing order of mammiferous animals has\r\nalways been, and ever will be, regarded by the million with feelings of\r\nmingled interest and disgust. Every one is irresistibly attracted by\r\nthe appearance and tricks of a monkey—very few leave the scene without\r\nsomething like mortified pride at the caricature held up to them. The\r\nzoologist regards the family with an interest proportioned to their\r\napproximation to man; but he knows that their apparent similarity to the\r\nhuman form vanishes before anatomical investigation; and that, although\r\nthere may be some points of resemblance, the distance between the\r\ntwo-handed and the four-handed types, notwithstanding all the ingenious\r\narguments of those philosophers who support the theory of a gradual\r\ndevelopment from a monad to a man, is great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA modern zoologist has, not inaptly, applied the term _Cheiropeds_ or\r\nhand-footed animals to this group; and, indeed, strictly speaking, they\r\ncan hardly be called quadrumanous or four-handed. Their extremities,\r\nadmirably fitted for grasping and climbing, as far as their arboreal\r\nhabits require those actions, fall short—how very far short!—of that\r\nwonderful instrument which surrounds a being born one of the most\r\nhelpless of all creatures, with necessaries, comforts, and luxuries, and\r\nenables him to embody his imaginings in works almost divine. We look\r\nin vain among the most perfectly-formed of the anthropoid apes for the\r\nwell-developed opposable thumb of the human hand—that great boon, the\r\nready agent of man’s will, by means of which he holds “dominion over the\r\nfish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air, and over every living\r\nthing that moveth upon the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe hands of the monkeys are at best but “half made up,” and they are\r\ngenerally more or less well fashioned in proportion to the greater or\r\nless prehensile development of the tail. The habits of the race, as we\r\nhave already hinted, are arboreal, and their favourite haunts are the\r\nrecesses of those tropical forests where they can either sport in the\r\nsunbeams on the topmost boughs, or shelter themselves from its scorching\r\nrays under the impervious canopy of a luxuriant vegetation. When their\r\nprivacy is invaded by man, a restless and constantly recurring curiosity\r\nseems to be their prevailing feeling at first, and at last the intruders\r\nare frequently pelted with stones, sticks, and fruits heavy and hard,\r\nmore especially if they make any demonstration of hostility.\r\n\r\nRobert Lade thus speaks of their behaviour when he went to hunt some of\r\nthem near the Cape:—\r\n\r\n“I can neither describe all the arts practised by these animals, nor\r\nthe nimbleness and impudence with which they returned after being\r\npursued by us. Sometimes they allowed us to approach so near them, that\r\nI was almost certain of seizing them; but when I made the attempt, they\r\nsprung, at a single leap, ten paces from me, and mounted trees with equal\r\nagility, from which they looked with great indifference, and seemed to\r\nderive pleasure from our astonishment. Some of them were so large, that\r\nif our interpreter had not assured us that they were neither ferocious\r\nnor dangerous, our number would not have appeared to be sufficient to\r\nprotect us from their attacks. As it would serve no purpose to kill them,\r\nwe did not use our guns” (we respect the good feeling of honest Robert\r\nand his companions); “but the captain happened to aim at a very large one\r\nwhich sat on the top of a tree, after having fatigued us a long time in\r\npursuing him. This kind of menace, however, of which the animal perhaps\r\nrecollected his having sometimes seen the consequences, terrified him\r\nto such a degree, that he fell down motionless at our feet, and we had\r\nno difficulty in seizing him. But whenever he recovered from his stupor\r\nit required all our dexterity and efforts to keep him. We tied his paws\r\ntogether; but he bit so furiously that we were under the necessity of\r\ncovering his head with our handkerchiefs.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, those who have only seen these agile creatures in menageries,\r\nor in a reclaimed state, can have no idea of the wild activity of the\r\ntribe in their native woods. Swinging and leaping from tree to tree, ever\r\non the hunt for fruits and birds’ nests—they are most unconscionable\r\nplunderers of eggs—they lead a merry life, which is, however, often cut\r\nshort by those mighty snakes that frequently lie in ambush near their\r\ncareless, unsuspecting prey. These serpents are the greatest enemies of\r\nthe monkeys, with the exception of the common persecutor—man. He, indeed,\r\nis sometimes touched by compunctious visitings, when it is too late.\r\n\r\n“Seeing me,” says a South American traveller, speaking of a monkey,\r\n“nearly on the bank of the river in a canoe, the creature made a halt\r\nfrom skipping after his companions, and, being perched on a branch that\r\nhung over the water, examined me with attention and the strongest marks\r\nof curiosity, no doubt taking me for a giant of his own species, while\r\nhe chattered prodigiously, and kept dancing and shaking the bough on\r\nwhich he rested with incredible strength and agility. At this time I laid\r\nmy piece to my shoulder, and brought him down from the tree into the\r\nstream; but may I never again be a witness to such a scene! The miserable\r\nanimal was not dead, but mortally wounded. I seized him by the tail,\r\nand taking him in both my hands to end his torments, swung him round\r\nand hit his head against the side of the canoe; but the poor creature\r\nstill continuing alive, and looking at me in the most affecting manner\r\nthat can be conceived, I knew no other means of ending his murder than\r\nto hold him under the water till he was drowned, while my heart sickened\r\non his account, for his dying little eyes still continued to follow me\r\nwith seeming reproach, till their light gradually forsook them, and the\r\nwretched animal expired. I felt so much on this occasion that I could\r\nneither taste of him nor his companions when they were dressed, though I\r\nsaw that they afforded to some others a delicious repast.”\r\n\r\nThe repentant writer and his party were driven to the commission of the\r\nact for want of fresh provisions; and many of the family are considered\r\nmost excellent eating—by those who can get over the appearance of the\r\nanimal and of its bones when cooked. There are not many, however, who\r\ncan sit down to a dish of monkeys without feeling that it is rather a\r\ncannibalish proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious, when the leafy home of this restless race is\r\nconsidered, that it is of the utmost consequence that the infant monkey\r\nshould be protected as much as possible from a fall. Accordingly, the\r\nprevailing instinct of a young one is, in sailor’s language, to hold on.\r\nIt clings to its mother with the greatest tenacity; and, to enable it\r\nto do this, considerable strength is thrown into the extremities, the\r\nanterior limbs especially.\r\n\r\nLe Vaillant, in his introduction to his first voyage, gives the following\r\ncurious instance of the exhibition of this instinct under extraordinary\r\ncircumstances. When living in Dutch Guiana, at Paramaribo, where he was\r\nborn, and where he had already, though very young, formed a collection of\r\ninsects, the future traveller and his party in one of their excursions\r\nhad killed a female monkey.\r\n\r\n“As she carried on her back a young one, which had not been wounded, we\r\ntook them both along with us; and when we returned to the plantation, my\r\nape had not quitted the shoulders of its mother. It clung so closely to\r\nthem, that I was obliged to have the assistance of a negro to disengage\r\nthem; but scarcely was it separated from her, when, like a bird, it\r\ndarted upon a wooden block that stood near, covered with my father’s\r\nperuke, which it embraced with its four paws, nor could it be compelled\r\nto quit its position. Deceived by its instinct, it still imagined itself\r\nto be on the back of its mother, and under her protection. As it seemed\r\nperfectly at ease on the peruke, I resolved to suffer it to remain, and\r\nto feed it there with goat’s milk. It continued in its error for three\r\nweeks, but after that period, emancipating itself from its own authority,\r\nit quitted the fostering peruke, and by its amusing tricks became the\r\nfriend and favourite of the whole family.”\r\n\r\nThough it is difficult to repress a smile at the idea of a monkey\r\nclinging to a full-bottom on a wig-block and fancying it its mamma, the\r\nstory, as it begins mournfully with the slaughter of the poor mother,\r\nends tragically for her unhappy offspring: it died a terrible death—the\r\nresult, indeed, of its own mischievous voracity, but in agonies frightful\r\nto think of:—\r\n\r\n“I had, however,” continues Le Vaillant, “without suspecting it,\r\nintroduced the wolf among my flocks. One morning, on entering my\r\nchamber, the door of which I had been so imprudent as to leave open,\r\nI beheld my unworthy pupil making a hearty breakfast on my noble\r\ncollection. In the first transports of my passion I resolved to\r\nstrangle it in my arms; but rage and fury soon gave place to pity, when\r\nI perceived that its voraciousness had exposed it to the most cruel\r\npunishment. In eating the beetles it had swallowed some of the pins on\r\nwhich they were fixed, and though it made a thousand efforts to throw\r\nthem up, all its exertions were in vain. The torture which it suffered\r\nmade me forget the devastation it had occasioned; I thought only of\r\naffording it relief; but neither my tears, nor all the art of my father’s\r\nslaves, whom I called from all quarters with loud cries, were able to\r\npreserve its life.”\r\n\r\nTo return to the instinct exemplified in the first part of this\r\nmelancholy tale: we remember to have seen a female monkey and her young\r\none in the cage of a menagerie—and a small cage too. In this case the\r\ninstinct—and it was a good example of the wide difference between that\r\nquality and reason—both on the part of the mother and her offspring, was\r\njust as strong as it could have been in their native forests. The young\r\none clung as tightly, and the mother showed as much anxiety lest it\r\nshould be dashed to pieces by a fall whilst she was sitting at the bottom\r\nof her cage, which rested on the ground, as if she had been swinging with\r\nthe breeze upon the tree top.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe docility and apparent intelligence which are so strongly marked in\r\nthe Chimpanzee and Orang, and which have given rise to such exaggerated\r\nideas of their intellect, have been always observed in youthful animals;\r\nwhile untamable ferocity and brutality—in short, the very reverse of\r\nthe amiable and interesting qualities which have been so much dwelt\r\non—have been uniformly the concomitants of age. The old anthropoid\r\napes have “foreheads villanous low.” Accordingly, though there may be\r\nexceptions to the general rule—and that there are we shall show—the\r\nstories told of our friends, whether by ancients or moderns, are hardly\r\never in their favour. There may be a certain degree of cunning, and\r\neven of accomplishment, in the monkey of whom the tale is told; but,\r\nin nine cases out of ten, the laugh is either at his expense, or he is\r\nonly saved from ridicule by some horrible catastrophe. From the earliest\r\nages down to the time of that wan-chancy creature Major Weir, Sir Robert\r\nRedgauntlet’s great ill-favoured jackanape, the whole tribe have been\r\nregarded as unlucky, meddling beings; the Major came to an untimely end,\r\nas every one knows, and where he went, or, at least, was expected, after\r\nthe breath was out of his body, is pretty plain.\r\n\r\nEither, like Ælian’s ape, the mimic, in its zeal for imitation, makes\r\nthe trifling mistake of plunging a child into boiling water instead of\r\ncold, or it is taken by the hunter’s stratagem of washing his face in its\r\npresence, and then leaving, by way of a lotion for the poor animal that\r\nhas been watching his motions, some of the best bird-lime, with which it\r\nbelutes its eyes till they are sealed up; or a parcel of shell-snails are\r\nplaced round it, in the midst of which it sits like a fool, not daring to\r\nstir for fear.\r\n\r\nThe same Ælian, indeed, and others, tell us of the ape that was a most\r\nskilful charioteer; of the adroitness of another in escaping from cats,\r\nwhen hunted by them on trees in Egypt, by running to the extremity of\r\na bough too slender to bear the cats, and so, taking advantage of its\r\nbending, reaching the ground in safety, leaving the cats _plantés là_,\r\nclutching and clinging on as they best might to save themselves from the\r\nshock of the recoil; of that renowned and all-accomplished animal, to\r\ncome to more modern times, the _Prægrandem simiam_, which Paræus saw in\r\n_ædibus Ducis Somei_, and which so excelled in many arts, that it was\r\nnamed _Magister Factotum_, but not till after the poor beast’s hands had\r\nbeen cut off to keep it out of mischief—to say nothing of the celebrated\r\n_coup_, dear to diplomatists, of the _cat’s paw_. Some of our readers,\r\nby the way, may not know that this scene which Edwin Landseer has so\r\nadmirably represented—painted, we would have said, but painting it may\r\nnot be called, for the coals are live coals, and the yelling cat is held\r\nby the imperturbable monkey to a fire that makes one hot to look at\r\nit—that this event, so familiar to every schoolboy, is recorded as having\r\nactually taken place in the hall of Pope Julius the Second.\r\n\r\nBut what are these to the clouds of unfortunate adventurers? An ape may\r\ngenerally be considered to be well off if he only loses an eye, like the\r\ncheiroped king’s son in the Arabian story, by magical fire.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add a legend evidently intended to convey an impression\r\nof the sapience of our friends; not that we are going to enter into the\r\ncontroversy as to whether the Prince of Darkness chose the similitude of\r\nan ape as the most appropriate for the temptation of our common mother\r\nEve; we leave that to the initiated: our tale is much more humble in its\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nIn “A New History of Ethiopia, being a full and accurate description of\r\nthe kingdom of Abessinia, vulgarly, though erroneously, called the Empire\r\nof Prester John, by the learned Job Ludolphus, author of the Ethiopic\r\nLexicon Made English by I. P. Gent.” (folio, 1862), there is a grand\r\nengraving of apes with this superscription:—\r\n\r\n“1. Scrambling about the mountains.\r\n\r\n“2. Removeing great huge stones to come at the wormes.\r\n\r\n“3. Sitting upon ant-hills and devouring the little creatures.\r\n\r\n“4. Throwing sand or dust in the eyes of wild beast that come to sett\r\nupon them.”\r\n\r\nThe whole being illustrative of the following edifying piece of\r\ninformation:—\r\n\r\n“Of apes there are infinite flocks up and down in the mountains\r\nthemselves, a thousand and more together: there they leave no stone\r\nunturned. If they meet with one that two or three cannot lift, they call\r\nfor more, and all for the sake of the wormes that lye under; a sort of\r\ndyet which they relish exceedingly. They are very greedy after emmets. So\r\nthat having found an emmet-hill, they presently surround it, and laying\r\ntheir fore-paws with the hollow downward upon the ant-heap, as fast as\r\nthe emmets creep into their trecherous palmes they lick ’em off with\r\ngreat comfort to their stomachs: and there they will lye till there is\r\nnot an emmet left. They are also pernicious to fruit and apples, and will\r\ndestroy whole fields and gardens, unless they be carefully looked after.\r\nFor they are very cunning, and will never venture in till the return of\r\ntheir spies, which they send always before; who giving information that\r\nall things are safe, in they rush with their whole body, and make a quick\r\ndispatch. Therefore they go very quiet and silent to their prey; and if\r\ntheir young ones chance to make a noise they chastise them with their\r\nfists, but if they find the coast clear, then every one hath a different\r\nnoise to express his joy. Nor could there be any way to hinder them from\r\nfurther multiplying, but that they fall sometimes into the ruder hands of\r\nthe wild beasts, which they have no way to avoid, but by a timely flight\r\nor creeping into the clefts of the rocks. If they find no safety in\r\nflight, they make a virtue of necessity, stand their ground, and filling\r\ntheir paws full of dust or sand, fling it full in the eyes of their\r\nassailant, and then to their heels again.”\r\n\r\nMost learned and veracious Job!\r\n\r\nA collection of stories, printed by John Rastell considerably more\r\nthan a century before the date of the work last quoted, and not long\r\nago discovered by the lamented Rev. I. I. Conybeare, next attracts our\r\nnotice. It is no other than _The Hundred Merry Tales_, the opprobrium\r\nof Benedick, or as it is imprinted “A. C. Mery Talys.” This curious and\r\nimportant addition to the stock of Shaksperiana had, as it is stated in\r\nthe advertisement of the private reprint (Chiswick, 1815), been converted\r\ninto the pasteboard which formed the covers of an old book. As far as the\r\npleasantry is concerned generally, we do not wonder at Benedick’s wincing\r\nunder Beatrice’s imputation that he got his wit out of it.\r\n\r\nBut though there is much matter of fact in the book, there are also many\r\nqueer tales, some of which have passed for new—“Old Simon,” for instance.\r\nOne of them, the forty sixth tale, is instructive, inasmuch as it shows\r\nwhat Chief Justices were in those days.\r\n\r\nThe story is headed “Of the Welcheman that delyuered the letter to the\r\nape.”\r\n\r\nThe first lines are wanting, but there is enough to make it appear that\r\na master sends his Welsh retainer with a letter to the Chief Justice,\r\nin order to obtain favour for a criminal who had been in the writer’s\r\nservice, with directions to the said Welshman to return with an answer.\r\nThe tale then proceeds thus:—\r\n\r\n“This Welcheman came to the Chefe Justyce place, and at the gate saw an\r\nape syttynge there in a cote made for hym, as they use to apparell apes\r\nfor disporte. This Welcheman dyd of his cappe and made curtsye to the\r\nape, and sayd—‘My mayster recommendeth him to my lorde youre father, and\r\nsendeth him here a letter.’ This ape toke this letter and opened it,\r\nand lokyd thereon, and after lokyd vpon the man, makynge many mockes\r\nand moyes as the propertyes of apes is to do. This Welcheman, because\r\nhe understood him nat, came agayne to his mayster accordynge to his\r\ncommandes, and told hym he delyuered the letter unto my lorde chefe\r\niustice sonne, who was at the gate in a furred cote. Anone his moyster\r\nasked him what answere he broughte? The man sayd he gaue him an answere,\r\nbut it was other Frenche or Laten, for he understode him nat. ‘But, syr,’\r\nquod he, ‘ye need nat to fere, for I saw in his countenance so much\r\nthat I warrante you he wyll do your errande to my lorde his father.’\r\nThis gentylman in truste thereof made not anye further suite. For lacke\r\nwhereof his seruant that had done the felonye within a monthe after was\r\nrayned at the kynge’s benche, and caste, and afterwarde hanged.”\r\n\r\nAnd what does the reader think the moral is? Some reflection, perhaps,\r\nupon the impunity of those attached to the great, with a hint at God’s\r\njudgment against unjust judges? No such thing:—“By this ye may see that\r\nevery wyse man ought to take hede that he sende nat a folyssche seruante\r\nvpon a hasty message that is a matter of nede.” Not a bad specimen of the\r\nmorality of the good old times.\r\n\r\nThose who would amuse themselves with more monkeyana of ancient date,\r\nwill find some choice passages in Erasmus, Porta, and others; and may\r\nlearn how a monkey may occasionally supersede the use of a comb—what a\r\nhorror monkeys have of tortoises and snails—how violent is the antipathy\r\nbetween the cock and the ape—and how both of these were added to the\r\nserpent and introduced into the deadly sack wherein the matricide was\r\ninclosed to suffer the frightful punishment awarded to his unnatural act.\r\nBut we beg to offer the following trifle, showing how a monkey can behave\r\nat a dinner-table:—\r\n\r\nIn a country town, no matter where, there lived the worthiest and most\r\nphilosophical of old bachelors, with a warm heart and a sound head, from\r\nwhose well-powdered exterior dangled that most respectable ornament a\r\n_queue_. Long did this august appendage, now no longer seen, linger\r\namong the Benchers of the inns of court. Two worthies we have yet in our\r\neye—_Ultimi Caudatorum!_ with what veneration do we look up to ye! with\r\nwhat fear and trembling did we regard the progress of the influenza!—the\r\ndestroying angel has passed by, and the tails still depend from your\r\n“frosty pows,” blessings on ’em!\r\n\r\nPardon the digression; and return we to our bachelor, who entertained\r\na monkey of such good breeding and so much discretion, that Jacko was\r\npermitted to make one at the dinner-table, where he was seated in a high\r\nchild’s chair next to his master, and took off his glass of perry and\r\nwater in the same time and measure with his patron, and in as good a\r\nstyle as Dominie Sampson himself could have performed the feat. Now, his\r\nmaster’s housekeeper made the best preserved apricots in the county, and\r\nwhen the said apricots were enshrined in a tart, the golden fruit set\r\noff by the superincumbent trellis, a more tempting piece of _pâtisserie_\r\ncould hardly be laid before man or monkey. One of these tarts enriched\r\nthe board at a small dinner-party, and was placed nearly opposite to\r\nJacko, who occupied his usual station. The host helped one and another\r\nto some of this exquisite tart, but he forgot poor Jacko, who had been\r\ndevouring it with his eyes, and was too well-bred to make any indecorous\r\nsnatch at the attraction, as most monkeys would have done. At last Jacko\r\ncould stand it no longer, so looking to the right and left, and finally\r\nfixing his eyes on the guests opposite, he quietly lifted up his hand\r\nbehind his master’s back, and gave his tail such a tug as made the powder\r\nfly, withdrew his hand in an instant, and sat with a vacant expression of\r\nthe greatest innocence. People don’t like to have their tails pulled. His\r\nmaster gave him a look, and Jacko gave him another, but even the eloquent\r\nexpression of Hogarth’s monkey on the offending bear’s back fell short of\r\nit. It said as plainly as look could speak—“Don’t be angry—don’t thrash\r\nme—they did not see it—I beg your pardon, but I _must_ have a bit of that\r\napricot tart:”—he was forgiven and helped.\r\n\r\nAuthors generally seem to think that the monkey race are not capable of\r\nretaining lasting impressions; but their memory is remarkably tenacious\r\nwhen striking events call it into action.\r\n\r\nOne that in his zeal for imitation had swallowed the entire contents of\r\na pill-box—the cathartics, fortunately, were not Morisonian—suffered so\r\nmuch, that ever afterwards the production of such a box sent him to his\r\nhiding-place in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nAnother that was permitted to run free had frequently seen the\r\nmen-servants in the great country kitchen, with its huge fireplace,\r\ntake down a powder-horn that stood on the chimney-piece, and throw a\r\nfew grains into the fire, to make Jemima and the rest of the maids jump\r\nand scream, which they always did on such occasions very prettily. Pug\r\nwatched his opportunity, and when all was still, and he had the kitchen\r\nentirely to himself, he clambered up, got possession of the well-filled\r\npowder-horn, perched himself very gingerly on one of the horizontal\r\nwheels placed for the support of saucepans, right over the waning ashes\r\nof an almost extinct wood-fire, screwed off the top of the horn, and\r\nreversed it over the grate.\r\n\r\nThe explosion sent him half-way up the chimney. Before he was blown up\r\nhe was a smug, trim, well-conditioned monkey as you would wish to see\r\non a summer’s day: he came down a carbonadoed nigger in miniature, in\r\nan avalanche of burning soot. The _à plomb_ with which he pitched upon\r\nthe hot ashes in the midst of the general flare-up aroused him to a\r\nsense of his condition. He was missing for days. Hunger at last drove\r\nhim forth, and he sneaked into the house close-singed, begrimed, and\r\nlooking scared and devilish. He recovered with care, but, like some other\r\ngreat personages, he never got over his sudden elevation and fall, but\r\nbecame a sadder if not a wiser monkey. If ever pug forgot himself and was\r\ntroublesome, you had only to take down a powder-horn in his presence, and\r\nhe was off to his hole like a shot, screaming and clattering his jaws\r\nlike a pair of castanets.\r\n\r\nLe Vaillant, in his African travels, was accompanied by an ape, which\r\nlived on very good terms with the cocks and hens, showing, in defiance\r\nof the legend, no antipathy to the former, and a strong penchant for the\r\nlatter, for whose cacklings he listened, and whose eggs he stole. But\r\nthis and other peccadillos were amply atoned for by the _bonhommie_ and\r\nother good qualities of Kees, for that was the name of the traveller’s\r\nape, which seems to have almost realised the virtues of Philip Quarl’s\r\nmonkey.\r\n\r\n“An animal,” says Le Vaillant in his first voyage, just after speaking of\r\nthe benefits that he derived from his gallant chanticleer, “that rendered\r\nme more essential services; which, by its useful presence, suspended\r\nand even dissipated certain bitter and disagreeable reflections that\r\noccurred to my mind, which by its simple and striking instinct seemed\r\nto anticipate my efforts, and which comforted me in my languor—was an\r\nape, of that kind so common at the Cape, under the name of _Bawians_.\r\nAs it was extremely familiar, and attached itself to me in a particular\r\nmanner, I made it my taster. When we found any fruit or roots unknown to\r\nmy Hottentots, we never touched them until my dear Kees had first tasted\r\nthem: if it refused them we judged them to be either disagreeable or\r\ndangerous, and threw them away.\r\n\r\n“An ape has one peculiarity which distinguishes it from all other\r\nanimals, and brings it very near to man. It has received from nature an\r\nequal share of greediness and curiosity: though destitute of appetite, it\r\ntastes without necessity every kind of food that is offered to it; and\r\nalways lays its paw upon everything it finds within its reach.\r\n\r\n“There was another quality in Kees which I valued still more. He was my\r\nbest guardian; and whether by night or by day he instantly awoke on the\r\nleast sign of danger. By his cries, and other expressions of fear, we\r\nwere always informed of the approach of an enemy before my dogs could\r\ndiscover it: they were so accustomed to his voice that they slept in\r\nperfect security, and never went the rounds; on which account I was\r\nextremely angry, fearing that I should no longer find that indispensable\r\nassistance which I had a right to expect, if any disorder or fatal\r\naccident should deprive me of my faithful guardian. However, when he had\r\nonce given the alarm, they all stopped to watch the signal; and on the\r\nleast motion of his eyes, or shaking of his head, I have seen them all\r\nrush forward, and scamper away in the quarter to which they observed his\r\nlooks directed.\r\n\r\n“I often carried him along with me in my hunting excursions, during\r\nwhich he would amuse himself in climbing up trees, in order to search\r\nfor gum, of which he was remarkably fond. Sometimes he discovered\r\nhoney in the crevices of rocks, or in hollow trees; but when he found\r\nnothing, when fatigue and exercise had whetted his appetite, and when\r\nhe began to be seriously oppressed by hunger, a scene took place which\r\nto me appeared extremely comic. When he could not find gum and honey he\r\nsearched for roots, and ate them with much relish; especially one of a\r\nparticular species, which, unfortunately for me, I found excellent and\r\nvery refreshing, and which I greatly wished to partake of. But Kees was\r\nvery cunning: when he found any of this root, if I was not near him to\r\nclaim my part, he made great haste to devour it, having his eyes all\r\nthe while directed towards me. By the distance I had to go before I\r\ncould approach him, be judged of the time he had to eat it alone; and I,\r\nindeed, arrived too late. Sometimes, however, when he was deceived in\r\nhis calculation, and when I came upon him sooner than he expected, he\r\ninstantly endeavoured to conceal the morsels from me; but by means of a\r\nblow well applied I compelled him to restore the theft; and in my turn\r\nbecoming master of the envied prey, he was obliged to receive laws from\r\nthe stronger party. Kees entertained no hatred or rancour; and I easily\r\nmade him comprehend how detestable that base selfishness was of which he\r\nhad set me an example.”\r\n\r\nThis is all very fine, but we confess that we think poor Kees hardly used\r\nin this matter; nor are we aware of any law, written or unwritten, human\r\nor Simian, by which the conversion of the root, which he had sagaciously\r\nfound, to his own use could be made a theft, or by which the prize\r\ncould be ravished from him, except, indeed, by the “good old law” that\r\n“sufficeth” people in such cases—\r\n\r\n                    “the simple plan,\r\n    That they should take who have the power,\r\n            And they should keep who can.”\r\n\r\nBut to return to Le Vaillant’s entertaining narrative.\r\n\r\n“To tear up these roots, Kees pursued a very ingenious method, which\r\nafforded me much amusement. He laid hold of the tuft of leaves with his\r\nteeth; and pressing his fore paws firmly against the earth, and drawing\r\nhis head backwards, the root generally followed: when this method, which\r\nrequired considerable force, did not succeed, he seized the tuft as\r\nbefore, as close to the earth as he could; then throwing his heels over\r\nhis head, the root always yielded to the jerk which he gave it. In our\r\nmarches, when he found himself tired, he got upon the back of one of my\r\ndogs, which had the complaisance to carry him for whole hours together:\r\none only, which was larger and stronger than the rest, ought to have\r\nserved him for this purpose; but the cunning animal well knew how to\r\navoid this drudgery. The moment he perceived Kees on his shoulders he\r\nremained motionless, and suffered the caravan to pass on, without ever\r\nstirring from the spot. The timorous Kees still persisted; but as soon as\r\nhe began to lose sight of us he was obliged to dismount, and he and the\r\ndog ran with all their might to overtake us. For fear of being surprised,\r\nthe dog dexterously suffered him to get before him, and watched him\r\nwith great attention. In short, he had acquired an ascendency over my\r\nwhole pack, for which he was perhaps indebted to the superiority of his\r\ninstinct; for among animals, as among men, address often gets the better\r\nof strength. While at his meals Kees could not endure guests; if any of\r\nthe dogs approached too near to him at that time, he gave them a hearty\r\nblow, which these poltroons never returned, but scampered away as fast as\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\n“It appeared to me extremely singular, and I could not account for it,\r\nthat, next to the serpent, the animal which he most dreaded was one of\r\nhis own species: whether it was that he was sensible that his being tamed\r\nhad deprived him of great part of his faculties, and that fear had got\r\npossession of his senses, or that he was jealous and dreaded a rivalry\r\nin my friendship. It would have been very easy for me to catch wild ones\r\nand tame them; but I never thought of it. I had given Kees a place in my\r\nheart which no other after him could occupy; and I sufficiently testified\r\nhow far he might depend on my constancy. Sometimes he heard others of\r\nthe same species making a noise in the mountains; and, notwithstanding\r\nhis terror, he thought proper, I know not for what reason, to reply\r\nto them. When they heard his voice they approached: but as soon as he\r\nperceived any of them he fled with horrible cries; and, running between\r\nour legs, implored the protection of everybody, while his limbs quivered\r\nthrough fear. We found it no easy matter to calm him; but he gradually\r\nresumed, after some time, his natural tranquillity. He was very much\r\naddicted to thieving, a fault common to almost all domestic animals; but\r\nin Kees it became a talent, the ingenious efforts of which I admired.\r\nNotwithstanding all the correction bestowed upon him by my people, who\r\ntook the matter seriously, he was never amended. He knew perfectly well\r\nhow to untie the ropes of a basket, to take provisions from it, and,\r\nabove all, milk, of which he was remarkably fond: more than once he has\r\nmade me go without any. I often beat him pretty severely myself; but,\r\nwhen he escaped from me, he did not appear at my tent till towards night.”\r\n\r\n“Milk in baskets!” why, truly, the term “basket” as applied to a vessel\r\nfor holding milk appears to require some explanation; but it was really\r\ncarried in baskets woven by the Gonaquas, of reeds, so delicate and so\r\nclose in texture that they might be employed in carrying water or any\r\nliquid. The abstraction of the milk, &c., we consider as a kind of\r\nset-off against the appropriation of Kees’s favourite root by his master.\r\n\r\nThe pertinacious way in which Kees bestrode Le Vaillant’s dogs will\r\nrecall to the remembrance of some a monkey that was, and perhaps still\r\nis, riding about London, in hat and feather, with garments to match, upon\r\na great dog, with the usual accompaniments of hand-organ and Pan’s pipe.\r\nUpon these occasions the monkey evidently felt proud of his commanding\r\nposition; but ever and anon we have seen him suffer from one of those\r\nsad reverses of fortune to which the greatest amongst us are subject.\r\nIn the midst of the performance, while the organ and pipe are playing,\r\nand the monkey has it all his own way, and, elevated with the grandeur\r\nthat surrounds him, is looking rather aristocratically at the admiring\r\ncrowd, some good-natured but unlucky boy throws the dog a bit of cake,\r\nin his zeal to pick up which the latter lowers his head and shoulders so\r\nsuddenly as infallibly to pitch his rider over his head. We have thought\r\nmore than once that there was a sly look about the dog as he regarded the\r\nunseated monkey, utterly confounded by his downfall and the accompanying\r\nshouts of laughter from the bystanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the South American monkeys are all blessed\r\nwith tails, but they are deprived of those brilliant blue and red\r\ncallosities which give so much splendour to the integuments of many of\r\nthe Old World family, and recall sometimes a part of the costume of a\r\ncertain unearthly pedestrian; for _his_ femoral habiliments\r\n\r\n                          “were blue,\r\n    And there was a hole where the tail came through.”\r\n\r\nNeither do they rejoice in cheek pouches: they are, consequently, unable\r\nto keep anything in the corner of their jaws, or to furnish forth any\r\nrebuke to the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns of the several courts in\r\nthis best of all possible worlds.\r\n\r\nWhen Humboldt and Bonpland landed at Cumana they saw the first troops of\r\nAraguatos, _Mycetes Ursinus_ (it is nearly three feet in length, without\r\nincluding the tail), as they journeyed to the mountains of Cocallor\r\nand the celebrated cavern of Guacharo. The forests that surrounded the\r\nconvent of Caripe, which is highly elevated, and where the centigrade\r\nthermometer fell to 70° during the night, abounded with them, and their\r\nmournful howling was heard, particularly in open weather or before rain\r\nor storms, at the distance of half a league. Upwards of forty of this\r\ngregarious species were counted upon one tree on the banks of the Apure;\r\nand Humboldt declares his conviction that, in a square league of these\r\nwildernesses, more than two thousand may be found. Melancholy is the\r\nexpression of the creature’s eye, listless is its gait, and dismal is\r\nits voice. The young ones never play in captivity like the Sagoins; no,\r\n“The Araguato de los Cumanenses,” as the worthy Lopez de Gomara voucheth,\r\n“hath the face of a man, the beard of a goat, and a staid behaviour,”\r\nsuch, in short, as may well beseem the possessor of such a “powerful\r\norgan,” as the newspaper critics have it.\r\n\r\nWe will endeavour, with Humboldt’s assistance, to convey to the reader\r\nsome idea of the structure of this sonorous instrument. That most\r\nobserving traveller states that the bony case of the _os hyoïdes_, or\r\nbone of the tongue, in the Mona Colorado is, in size, equal to four cubic\r\ninches (water measurement). The _larynx_, or windpipe, consisting of six\r\npouches, ten lines in length and from three to five in depth, is slightly\r\nattached by muscular fibres. The pouches are like those of the little\r\nwhistling monkeys, squirrels, and some birds. Above these pouches are two\r\nothers, the lips or borders of which are of a yellowish cast; these are\r\nthe pyramidal sacs which are formed by membranous partitions and enter\r\ninto the bony case. Into these sacs, which are from three to four inches\r\nin length and terminate in a point, the air is driven; the fifth pouch\r\nis in the aperture of the arytenoïd cartilage, and is situated between\r\nthe pyramidal sacs, of the same form but shorter; and the sixth pouch is\r\nformed by the bony drum itself: within this drum the voice acquires the\r\ndoleful tone above alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe _Quata_, or, as the French write the word, _Coaita_ (_Ateles\r\npaniscus_), is said to unite activity with intelligence, gentleness,\r\nprudence, and penetration. To be sure the Quatas will, when they meet\r\nwith a learned traveller, or any other strange animal, descend to the\r\nlower branches of their trees, to examine the phenomenon, and, when they\r\nhave satisfied their curiosity, pelt the phenomenon aforesaid to get\r\nrid of him or it; but that they be sensible and trustworthy is proved\r\nby Acosta, who has immortalised the Quata belonging to the Governor of\r\nCarthagena. This domestic was regularly sent to the tavern for wine.\r\nThey who sent him put an empty pot into one hand, and the money into the\r\nother; whereupon he went spidering along to the tavern, where they could\r\nby no means get his money from him till they had filled his pot with\r\nwine. As this Ganymede of the Governor came back with his charge, certain\r\nidle children would occasionally meet him in the street and cast stones\r\nat him; whereupon he would set down his pot and cast stones at _them_,\r\n“till he had assured his way, then would he return to carry home his pot.\r\nAnd what is more, although he was a good bibber of wine, yet would he\r\nnever touch it till leave was given him.” We are sorry to add that this\r\namiable genus is considered very good eating. Humboldt frequently saw the\r\nbroiled limbs of the Marimonda in the huts of the natives on the Orinoco;\r\nand, at Emeralda, he found in an Indian hut a collation of their roasted\r\nand dried bodies, prepared as the _pièces de résistance_ for a “harvest\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nOf the _Cebi_, the Horned Sapajou (_Cebus Albifrons_), with the hair\r\nof its forehead standing up so as to give the animal the appearance\r\nof having a London waterman’s cap on, is one of the largest, while the\r\n_Ouavapavi des cataractes_, which is very mild and intelligent, is of\r\nsmall size. We remember once to have heard of a sort of compact which was\r\nsaid to have been entered into between a monkey and a pig, the latter\r\nof which carried the monkey a certain number of times round an orchard,\r\nin consideration of the monkey’s climbing the apple-trees, and giving\r\nthem a shake for the benefit of the porker. Though not very old at the\r\ntime, we gave the narrator credit for being blessed with a very lively\r\nimagination, albeit the story was told gravely and vouched as a fact. But\r\nHumboldt actually saw, at Maypures, one of these domesticated Ouavapavis\r\nobtaining his rides apparently without any such understanding; for this\r\nclever monkey used to bide his time, and every morning caught a luckless\r\npig, which he compelled to perform the part of his horse. Seated on\r\npigback did he majestically ride about, the whole day, clinging to his\r\nbristly steed as firmly as ever the Old Man of the Sea clung to Sinbad,\r\nnot even giving poor piggy a respite at meal times, but continually\r\nbestriding him all the time he was feeding in the savanna that\r\nsurrounded the Indian huts. A missionary had another of these riders;\r\nbut the missionary’s monkey had laid the strong hand of possession on a\r\ncomfortable cat which had been brought up with him, carried him well, and\r\nbore all his felestrian exploits with patience and good-humour.\r\n\r\nThe tail, which has become less and less prehensile in the genera last\r\nnoticed, becomes in _Callithrix_ no longer capable of use as a support.\r\nThe pretty playful little Siamiri, whose length hardly exceeds ten inches\r\nexclusive of the tail, which reaches thirteen or fourteen, winds that\r\nappendage like a boa round its body and limbs, reminding the zoologist\r\nin some degree of the mode in which the white-fronted Lemur disposes of\r\nhis; and we now begin to observe, moreover, traces of insectivorous and\r\ncarnivorous appetite. The Macavacahow, at the sight of a bird, is roused\r\nat once from its apparent apathy; darting on its victim like a cat, it\r\nsecures the prize, and swallows it in an instant, with all the actions\r\nthat mark the beast of prey.\r\n\r\nIn the Dourocouli, the Cara rayada of the missionaries, we observe traces\r\nof the cat in appearance, voice, and manners. This curious animal is nine\r\ninches in length; and its tail, which is hairy, but not prehensile, is\r\nabout fourteen; the head is large and round; the muzzle short; the eyes\r\nvery large; but there is no apparent external ear. Three dark stripes\r\nare drawn on the head, and come down in front, the centre stripe on the\r\nforehead and the two lateral ones reaching to the rounded corners of the\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe animal is, during the day, “a huge sleeper,” whence its name “Mono\r\nDormillon.” Humboldt, notwithstanding the warning of the natives, that\r\nthe Dourocoulis will tear out the eyes of slumbering men, kept one in\r\nhis bedroom. It slept regularly from nine in the morning till seven at\r\nnight; and sometimes it went to sleep at daybreak. It hated the light,\r\nand, when disturbed, the lethargic animal could scarcely raise its heavy\r\nwhite eyelids; and its large eyes, which, at nightfall, were lighted up\r\nlike those of an owl, were lustreless. It must have been but a restless\r\ncompanion for the night: _then_ it was all exertion and activity, made\r\nwild noises, and was constantly jumping up against the walls. It lived\r\nfor five months, but all attempts to tame it were fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe Dourocoulis are captured during the day by the natives, when they are\r\nfast asleep in some hollow tree. The male and female are often taken in\r\nthe same hole, for they live in pairs. In a state of nature they pursue\r\nsmall birds and insects, not neglecting vegetables, almost every kind of\r\nwhich they will eat. Humboldt’s specimen was very fond of flies, which it\r\ncaught dexterously, and would even sometimes rouse itself for this chase\r\non a gloomy day. Its night-cry resembled that of the Jaguar, and it is\r\nthence called _Titi-tigre_. The mewing notes which it occasionally sends\r\nforth remind the hearer of a cat, and this resemblance is heightened when\r\nthe head of a Douroucouli in a state of irritation swells, and the animal\r\nhisses or spits, throws itself into the position of a cat when attacked\r\nby a dog, and strikes quick and cat-like with its paw. Its voice is very\r\npowerful for its size. In the Leoncito, whose body does not exceed seven\r\nor eight inches in length, we have much of the appearance of a tiny lion.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the genus _Pithecia_ that we have the nearest approach to\r\nhuman likeness. There are some strong resemblances in the Couxio; but, as\r\nHumboldt well observes, of all the monkeys of America, the Capuchin of\r\nthe Orinoco bears the greatest similitude in its features to man. There\r\nare the eyes with their mingled expression of melancholy and fierceness;\r\nthere is the long thick beard; and, as this last conceals the chin, the\r\nfacial angle appears much less than it really is. Strong, active, fierce,\r\nthe Capuchin is tamed with the greatest difficulty, and, when angered,\r\nhe raises himself on his hinder extremities, grinds his teeth in his\r\nwrath, and leaps around his antagonist with threatening gestures. If any\r\nmalicious person wishes to see this Homunculus in a most devouring rage,\r\nlet him wet the Capuchin’s beard, and he will find that such an act is\r\nthe unforgivable sin. There is one point, indeed, wherein our monkey\r\ndiffers from civilised man—he very seldom drinks; but, when he does, the\r\nsimilarity returns. Unlike the other American monkeys, which bring their\r\nlips to the liquid, the Capuchin lifts the water in the hollow of his\r\nhand, inclines his head upon his shoulder, and, carrying the draught to\r\nhis mouth in the cup of Diogenes, drains it with great deliberation. This\r\nappears to be his mode of drinking in a state of nature; and Humboldt\r\nthinks that it is adopted to prevent the wetting of the beard which\r\nrenders the animal furious, and which could not be avoided if the lips\r\nwere applied in the usual Simian mode. Our friend the Capuchin is about\r\ntwo feet nine, bushy tail and all, of a brownish red colour, the hair\r\nof the body being long, and that on the forehead having a direction\r\nforwards. The beard, which arises below the ears, is brown, inclining to\r\nblack, and covers the upper part of the breast. His large sunken eyes\r\nare overarched with well-marked brows, and his nails are bent, with the\r\nexception of those on his thumbs. He is not gregarious, and is seldom\r\nfound in company with his female.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to notice another of these _Pitheciæ_ with black face\r\nand hands and a shorter tail, having a good deal of the general aspect\r\nin miniature of one of those respectable, ancient, withered negroes,\r\nwho, after a long life of slavery, find themselves, in their old age,\r\ntransmuted, by legislative magic, into apprentices. This species, which\r\nis termed the Cacajao, is hardly more than a foot long. It is voracious,\r\nweak, very lazy, mild, easily frightened, and lives in troops in the\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nIn _Callathrix_ and _Aotes_ the carnivorous propensity and character\r\nare, as we have seen, joined to the general habits of the monkey; and\r\nwe proceed to finish this imperfect sketch of the American _Simiadæ_\r\nby calling the reader’s attention to forms distinguished by a union of\r\nthat character and propensity with squirrel-like manners. Such are the\r\ngenera _Hapales_ and _Midas_. To the latter belong the pretty diminutive\r\nMarikina or Silky Monkey and the Leoncito before alluded to. These,\r\nthough their way of life is but little ascertained, are supposed hardly\r\never to quit the trees.\r\n\r\nOf the debonnaire Ouistiti or Sanglain much more is known. This small,\r\ndelicate creature, with its rich pale grey coat, and pale greyish-white\r\near-tufts, like the _ailes de pigeon_ of the old beau of other days,\r\nfeeds in its native woods not only on fruits, roots, and seeds, but also\r\nindulges occasionally in insects and little birds. In captivity the\r\nSanglains are great pets, and Edwards relates a curious instance of the\r\ncraving for something that possessed life breaking out in one that was\r\nthe favourite of a lady. Once, when he was let loose, he snatched a gold\r\nfish from its “watery glass,” and instantly killed and devoured it. The\r\nlady, upon this, made him a present of some live eels, and, as the little\r\nfellow was not more than eight inches long without his tail, these lively\r\ngifts frightened him at first a good deal by twisting round his neck when\r\nhe seized them. His carnivorous nature, however, prevailed, and, without\r\na well-sanded hand, he soon mastered and ate them.\r\n\r\nThe great French naturalist Cuvier had an opportunity of observing their\r\ndomestic arrangements in a conjugal state. He had a pair who were blessed\r\nwith three young ones; but it seems to have been the Lady Sanglain’s\r\nfirst accouchement, and she had no experienced female friend to direct\r\nher; so after regarding her interesting progeny, she proceeded to bite\r\noff the head of one of them; the other two, in the meantime, took to the\r\nbreast, and the moment the mother felt them she was all affection. The\r\npapa was even more affectionate than the mamma, and assiduously assisted\r\nin the nursery. The favourite position of the young ones was upon the\r\nback or bosom of the mother; and, when she was tired of nursing she would\r\ncome up to her mate with a shrill cry, which said as plainly as cry could\r\nspeak, “Here! do take the children.” He, like a good-natured father,\r\nimmediately stretched forth his hands and placed his offspring upon his\r\nback or under his body, where they held on while he carried them about,\r\ntill they became restless for want of that which he could not give them;\r\nand then he handed them back to his partner, who, after satisfying their\r\nhunger, again turned them over to their papa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon: Printed by Jas.

So many volumes\r\nnow issue from the press low in tone and lax in morality that it is\r\nespecially incumbent on all who would avoid the taint of such hurtful\r\nmatter to select carefully the books they would themselves read or\r\nintroduce to their households. In view of this design, no author whose\r\nname is not a guarantee of the real worth and purity of his or her work,\r\nor whose book has not been subjected to a rigid examination, will be\r\nadmitted into “THE LILY SERIES.”\r\n\r\n    1. =A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite’s Life.= By the Author of\r\n    “Faith Gartney’s Girlhood,” “The Gayworthys,” &c.\r\n\r\n    2. =The Gayworthys, a Story of Threads and Thrums.= By the\r\n    Author of “Faith Gartney’s Girlhood.”\r\n\r\n    3. =Faith Gartney’s Girlhood.= By the Author of “The\r\n    Gayworthys.”\r\n\r\n    4. =The Gates Ajar; or, Our Loved Ones in Heaven.= By ELIZABETH\r\n    STUART PHELPS.\r\n\r\n    5. =Little Women.= By the Author of “Good Wives,” “Something to\r\n    Do,” &c.\r\n\r\n    6. =Good Wives.= By the Author of “Little Women,” &c.\r\n\r\n    7. =Alone.= By MARION HARLAND, Author of “The Hidden Path,” &c.\r\n\r\n    8. =I’ve Been Thinking.= By the Author of “Looking Round,” &c.\r\n\r\n    9. =Ida May.= By MARY LANGDON.\r\n\r\n    10. =The Lamplighter.= By MISS CUMMING.\r\n\r\n    11. =Stepping Heavenward.= By the Author of “Aunt Jane’s Hero.”\r\n\r\n    12. =Gypsy Breynton.= By the Author of “The Gates Ajar.”\r\n\r\n    13. =Aunt Jane’s Hero.= By the Author of “Stepping Heavenward.”\r\n\r\n    14. =The Wide, Wide World.= By MISS WETHERELL.\r\n\r\n    15. =Queechy.= By the Author of “The Wide, Wide World.”\r\n\r\n    16. =Looking Round.= By the Author of “I’ve Been Thinking.”\r\n\r\n    17. =Fabrics.

We may confidently state in regard to this series, that\r\n    apart from the good taste displayed by the publishers in their\r\n    selection of popular literature, these volumes are got up in a\r\n    superior and more expensive style than the ordinary class of\r\n    novels.”—_Gateshead Observer._\r\n\r\n    “...
