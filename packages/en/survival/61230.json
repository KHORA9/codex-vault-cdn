Dodge, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nButton Bay State Park is located on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain\r\nwith lake frontage on Button Bay (see maps, Figs. 1 and 2). This Vermont\r\nState Park is reached from the nearest large town, Vergennes, by\r\nproceeding southwest, toward Addison, on State Route 22A for .25 miles\r\nbeyond the bridge over Otter Creek, thence, right on the Basin\r\nHarbor-Panton road for another 1.4 miles to the first road entering from\r\nthe right. Turn right on this, the Basin Harbor road, and proceed for\r\n4.5 miles, thence, left for 1.4 miles to Button Bay State Park (see map,\r\nFig. 2, note arrows). A more direct road is planned to connect the Basin\r\nHarbor Road with the Park, however, this route has still not been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nPrior to its present name, Button Bay, the “sickle-shaped bay” on which\r\nButton Bay State Park is located was termed _Button Mould Bay_[1]. In\r\n“The Journal of William Gilliland” which is found in the “Pioneer\r\nHistory of the Champlain Valley” by Winslow C. Watson, Albany, 1863, and\r\nunder the date of September 7, 1765, is found an entry which speaks of\r\n“his (Gilliland) overtaking ‘_the Governors and other gentlemen_’[2] at\r\nButton Mould Bay, and going aboard their sloop.”\r\n\r\nA book of charts by Captain William Chambers contains one entitled “Baye\r\ndu Roche Fendue (Split-Rock Bay) and the soundings taken in August\r\n1779.” At the upper corner of the chart is the name “Button Mould Bay.”\r\nThe first appearance of the shortened version, Button Bay, seems to be\r\nin Whitelaw’s map of 1796 which was used as the frontispiece of the\r\nCensus volume, “Heads of Families, Vermont, 1800.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                 _FIGURE 1_\r\n                MAP OF WEST-CENTRAL VERMONT AND EASTERN NEW YORK]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                 _FIGURE 2_]\r\n\r\nWhy the name Button Bay? H. M. Seely (1910, p. 274)[3] when discussing\r\nthe shoreline of this bay states, “Besides shells, _concretions_[4],\r\nsome of strange imitative forms (many shaped like animals), are loosened\r\nfrom the clay.” He goes on to say that a “form particularly abundant in\r\nthe banks of the bay (and on the beach) has the shape and size of a\r\nturned wood button-mold (mold is commonly spelled ‘mould’ by the\r\nBritish), a disc with a hole in the center, plane (flat) on one side and\r\nconvex on the other” (see Fig. 3 and cover picture). The abundance of\r\nthese button mold-shaped concretions obviously led to the older name,\r\nButton Mould Bay which was later shortened to Button Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE GEOLOGY OF BUTTON BAY STATE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the visitor confines his wanderings to the State Park the most\r\nconspicuous geological features, or clues to the Park’s past history,\r\nare concentrated in the clay banks and adjacent beach which border Lake\r\nChamplain (see Fig. 4). The clays which cover the entire Park record\r\nthousands of years of rather recent events, _geologically speaking_[5],\r\nwhich took place in the Champlain Valley. These clays also record a very\r\nsignificant phase in the development of present Lake Champlain. Before\r\ndiscussing the clays it will be necessary to outline some of the\r\ngeological events which preceded the deposition of the clays, that is,\r\nsome of those events which took place as the last glacial ice lobe\r\nslowly retreated up the Champlain Valley and into Canada. The author has\r\nborrowed heavily from an article by Donald H. Chapman entitled\r\n“Late-Glacial and Post-glacial History of the Champlain Valley” which\r\nwas published in the 1941-1942 “Report of the State Geologist on the\r\nMineral Industries and Geology of Vermont, twenty-third of (the)\r\nSeries.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Water-worn concretions seen on the beach of\r\n    Button Bay State Park. The button-mold shape of some concretions led\r\n    to the incorporation of the word “Button” in the name Button Bay\r\n    (Originally, Button-Mould Bay). The chisel portion of the Alpine ice\r\n    ax head is about 5 inches long.]\r\n\r\nDuring the final retreat of the last ice sheet to invade the New England\r\nstates (some 11,000 to 12,000 years ago) an ice lobe, which occupied the\r\nHudson-Champlain Valley, slowly wasted northward toward the Canadian\r\nborder. Melt-water derived from the melting glacial ice together with\r\natmospheric water (rain and snow) formed a succession of lakes dammed on\r\nthe north by the glacial ice. These lakes emptied to the south through\r\nthe Hudson Valley. This succession of lakes and intermediate lake stages\r\nwill be discussed in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. View of beach, Button Bay State Park,\r\n    looking toward the southeast. The beach demonstrates several\r\n    water-level and storm-level debris lines. Note the conspicuous lack\r\n    of sand on this “clay” beach.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest lake recognized by the geologists is termed “Lake Albany” and\r\nwas confined to the Hudson Valley. At this time the area of present-day\r\nLake Champlain, north of the Hudson Valley, was still covered by glacial\r\nice which was slowly melting as the general regional climate throughout\r\nNew England became warmer and warmer. Soon the whole Hudson Valley\r\nregion began to _rise_[6] out from beneath the lake waters and “Lake\r\nAlbany” shallowed. Eventually a rock ledge emerged just south of\r\nSchuylerville, New York (actually at Coveville, New York) over which the\r\nwaters from a new lake, Lake Vermont, began to flow.\r\n\r\nLake Vermont, with its rock ledge dam at Coveville, began to expand\r\nnorthward as the ice front retreated up the Champlain Valley. Several\r\ndistinct stages in its development are now recognized in _features_[7]\r\ndemonstrating past lake levels which are abundantly displayed close to\r\nButton Bay State Park. The “lake-level indicators” or features tell us,\r\nin addition to the number of distinct lake stages in a given area,\r\nsomething about past earth movements. A “line of\r\nlake-level-_elevation_”[8] is drawn through those features outlining\r\neach past lake or lake stage followed by a comparison of each line with\r\nthose lines constructed for older and younger lakes or lake stages. If,\r\nfor any two lake-level lines compared, these lines are not parallel, it\r\ncan be assumed that the earth’s crust was tilted during the time between\r\nthe formation of their lake-level features. This idea of tilting of the\r\nearth’s surface, which is supported through the study of successive lake\r\nlevels, has proven the key to the present status of Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of its history Lake Vermont emptied to the south\r\nthrough an outlet channel located in the vicinity of Coveville, New York\r\n(see map, Fig. 5A). This stage in the development of Lake Vermont, often\r\nreferred to as the Coveville Stage, saw lake waters fill the Champlain\r\nValley from the Green Mountains on the east to a position west of the\r\npresent New York-Lake Champlain shoreline. Such Vermont towns as\r\nMiddlebury, Vergennes, Hinesburg, Burlington and Colchester would have\r\nbeen submerged beneath the lake waters (see map, Fig. 5B). Certain high\r\nareas such as Mount Philo, Pease Mountain and Cobble Hill show\r\nlake-level features along their sides which prove that these areas were\r\nislands rising above the level of this past lake. If you visit Mt. Philo\r\nState Park, located approximately 11 miles north of Vergennes, one of\r\nthese lake-level features, a wave-cut terrace, can be seen at an\r\nelevation of 545 feet and on the south side of the hill (at the level of\r\nthe second reverse turn in your trip to the _summit area_).[9]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                 _FIGURE 5_\r\n                    _EARLY COVEVILLE_    _MAXIMUM COVEVILLE_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Looking west from the top of Mount Philo\r\n    State Park. The Adirondack Mountains are on the skyline, Lake\r\n    Champlain in middle background and the Champlain Lowlands stretch\r\n    from Lake Champlain to the base of Mount Philo.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                 _FIGURE 7_\r\n                     _FORT ANN MAXIMUM_    _MARINE MAXIMUM_]\r\n\r\nShortly after Coveville Lake Vermont reached its maximum size (see map,\r\nFig. 5B), a southern gorge-outlet was formed at an elevation lower than\r\nthe previous Coveville outlet in the vicinity of Fort Ann, New York\r\n(Fort Ann is located approximately 8 miles south of the present southern\r\nextremity of Lake Champlain). The level of Lake Vermont’s water dropped\r\nto the new Fort Ann Stage (see map, Fig. 7A). Evidence for this new lake\r\nlevel is seen on the slopes of Mt. Philo, Snake Mountain and Cobble\r\nHill. These lake-level features are parallel to and found 100 feet below\r\nthose of the Coveville Stage. These parallel features, then, indicate\r\nthat very little, if any, tilting of the earth’s crust had taken place\r\nbetween the Coveville and Fort Ann lake stages.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8. Beach and clay banks exposed along the Lake\r\n    Champlain portion of Button Bay State Park. This view is toward the\r\n    northwest and includes a major portion of the Park’s lake frontage.\r\n    Photo by Robert B. Williams.]\r\n\r\nThis Champlain ice lobe continued to melt and retreat toward the\r\nCanadian border and beyond. As the glacial front approached the St.\r\nLawrence valley, fresh water from Lake Vermont began to seep through the\r\nretreating ice lobe and into the marine waters which filled the St.\r\nLawrence area. Several shoreline (lake-level) features are found at\r\ndifferent elevations below the Fort Ann Stage of Lake Vermont and attest\r\nto a slow lowering of the lake level by the escape of fresh water to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous clays of Button Bay State Park were deposited during the\r\nnext episode in the history of the Champlain Valley, a development\r\nheralded by continued retreat of the ice lobe and contact with the St.\r\nLawrence marine waters. Let’s take a look at the clays so well displayed\r\nalong the Button Bay State Park beach and see if we can piece together\r\ntheir history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE CLAYS OF BUTTON BAY STATE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best location in the park for a good look at the clays which cover\r\nthe entire Park area is along the lake beach (see Figs. 4 and 8). The\r\nbank averages 23 feet in height measured from the beach to the top of\r\nthe bank. The width of the beach varies seasonally and during storms as\r\nthe water level of Lake Champlain fluctuates (see Figs. 4 and 8). A walk\r\nalong the beach will reveal some interesting facts about the composition\r\nof the beach and the adjacent clay banks.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help observing the scarcity of _sand_[10] on the beach. The\r\nonly adjacent material to build this beach is clay, which here contains\r\na small quantity of sand and some concretions containing lime. The\r\nsickle shape of Button Bay keeps most foreign sand from the beach. The\r\nsmall patches of sand present soon give way to _blue clay_[11] which, in\r\nmany places, forms the base of the beach. This blue clay can also be\r\nseen in the base of the bank in the southern portion of the Park, where\r\nit underlies and is therefore older than the _brown clay_.[12]\r\n\r\nActually very little of the blue clay is exposed in the Park. From other\r\nlocations along the shore of Lake Champlain and in the more inland areas\r\nof the Champlain Lowlands geologists have found many clues to help our\r\nunderstanding of its history.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9A. View of the Brown Clay at the base of the\r\n    clay-cliff, Button Bay State Park. For scale, note the small\r\n    ballpoint pen resting on top of ledge (left of center). A close-up\r\n    view of this ledge (pen in same location) is seen in Figure 10.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9B. Close-up view showing general\r\n    characteristics of the Brown Clay. Notice the vertical cracks in the\r\n    clay. These cracks or joints are very common in the clays of this\r\n    State Park.]\r\n\r\nIn August 1849 the incomplete skeleton of a _whale_[13] was found in a\r\nrailroad cut being excavated for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad.\r\nThis cut was located approximately 12 miles south of Burlington and a\r\nmile east of Lake Champlain. The significant fact about this “find” is\r\nthat these bones were found in the same type of blue clay that occurs at\r\nthe beach in Button Bay State Park. Clam and oyster shells (Pelecypods)\r\nwere found in association with the whale bones. These _pelecypod\r\nshells_[14] and the whale bones show that these animals lived and died\r\nin cold marine waters. Lake Champlain today is a fresh-water lake and\r\nthe fish and other organisms in it are those of fresh, not salty water.\r\nYet the blue clays (and we are soon to learn, the brown clays) hold\r\nevidence proving the existence of sea water in an area where a\r\nfresh-water lake is found today. Can this be explained?\r\n\r\nThe brown clay forms most of the Park’s clay banks (see Figs. 9A and 9B\r\n). It can be examined easily by the visitor. The bank is composed of\r\nclay and variable amounts of _fine sand_[15] in thin lens-shaped bodies.\r\nThe hard dry outer clay, if rain has not just fallen, of the upper 15\r\nfeet of the bank appears light brown or tan-white and commonly contains\r\ninterspersed white and blue streaks. In the section of the bank which\r\nwas the object of detailed study, two conspicuous _convoluted beds_[16]\r\nwere found, one 5 feet above the beach, the other nearly 2 feet above\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nShells of _pelecypods_[17] occur at two and perhaps three levels within\r\nthe bank. They can be seen easily in many slumped clay bodies along the\r\nbeach (see Fig. 10, in which the shells are mainly _Macoma_ and\r\n_Saxicava_). These shells once belonged to living animals whose very\r\nclose relatives and identical younger generations are found living today\r\nin cold Arctic waters. Brown clays were deposited in a marine Champlain\r\nSea. How did these marine waters get into the Champlain Valley?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10. Close-up view showing the pelecypod (clam)\r\n    shells which occur within the Brown Clays. Note small Ballpoint pen\r\n    for scale. These shells tell us of the marine origin for these\r\n    clays. The pelecypods here are _Saxicava_ and _Macoma_.]\r\n\r\nRemember from the previous discussion of Lake Vermont that as the\r\nChamplain ice lobe retreated into Canada, fresh water from Lake Vermont\r\nbegan to seep through the ice lobe into the St. Lawrence Valley. This\r\nseepage caused a gradual lowering of the Lake Vermont water-level until\r\nthe lake reached a stage lower than the marine waters of the St.\r\nLawrence Sea. Soon the sea water began to flood Lake Vermont and true\r\nmarine conditions were reached. These marine waters reached as far south\r\nas Whitehall, New York, which is located near the southern end of\r\npresent-day Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nThe maximum area covered by the Champlain Sea did not equal the greatest\r\nsize attained by the fresh waters of Lake Vermont. For instance, the sea\r\ndid not extend as far east as the Green Mountains except in the very\r\nnorthernmost region of Vermont. In the vicinity of Button Bay State Park\r\nthese waters extended less than a mile east of Vergennes, and the towns\r\nof Middlebury, Hinesburg and Charlotte would have been entirely above\r\nwater (see map, Fig. 7B).\r\n\r\nIt has been postulated that marine waters extended throughout the length\r\nof the Champlain Valley and into the Hudson Valley, forming a continuous\r\nstrip of marine water from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Atlantic\r\nOcean at the mouth of the Hudson River. If this were true, New England\r\nwould have been an island only a few years ago (geologically speaking).\r\nThe weight of evidence available today does not support the prior\r\nexistence of this connecting ribbon of sea water. Today Lake Champlain\r\ncontains fresh water again, and the marine conditions have retreated\r\nback into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. What happened to permit a return to\r\nfresh water conditions?\r\n\r\nThe lakes and lake-stages discussed are known from the presence of\r\nvarious shoreline features, most of which are now “high and dry.” Each\r\nlake or lake-stage has its own set of lake-level features. An\r\ninteresting fact emerges from a study of any one former lake. The\r\npresent elevation above sea level of delimiting lake-level features is\r\n_not_ the same throughout. To explain this more fully, the present\r\nelevation of those features formed when the Champlain Sea was at its\r\nmaximum extent will be examined.\r\n\r\nAt Shelburne Falls the present elevation of these features is 300 feet,\r\nat St. Albans 440 feet, and at Roxton, Quebec, 552 feet. It will be\r\nnoted that proceeding from south (Shelburne Falls) to north (Roxton) a\r\ndifference of over 250 feet is found between features formed at an\r\nidentical time in the past. The water in any lake is practically level.\r\nIt therefore follows that the present 300, 440 and 552 foot elevations\r\nof the shoreline features are the result of subsequent tilting of the\r\nearth’s surface. Perhaps the following reference to the water level of\r\npresent Lake Champlain will help in your understanding of this tilting.\r\n\r\nThe present-day average level of the water in Lake Champlain is about 92\r\nfeet above the level of the Atlantic Ocean. This water-level elevation\r\nis constant throughout the extent of Lake Champlain and _is not_, say,\r\n92 feet at Button Bay and 192 feet at Burlington. Again, the only way\r\nthat features demonstrating past lake margins or levels could, for any\r\none lake or lake-stage, now exist at different elevations would be if\r\nsome earth movements took place after the formation of the features,\r\nresulting in a change from their original elevations.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s crust has been tilted, higher in the north than in the\r\nsouth, during recent times. This tilting provides the clue to the\r\nformation of present-day Lake Champlain. Major tilting took place after\r\nthe maximum marine invasion. Tilting continued, at a decreasing rate,\r\nperhaps, to the present day. This tilting, with greater relative rise in\r\nthe northwest, eventually reached a point where marine waters were\r\nexcluded from the Champlain Basin.\r\n\r\nFresh water slowly diluted the salty marine water. The lake gathered\r\nmore and more fresh water through rain and melting snow, and a new\r\noutlet formed in the north, in the approximate location of the present\r\nRichelieu River. The area of Lake Champlain slowly increased to its\r\npresent size, and the clays which once formed lake and sea bottom became\r\nthe “hard earth” of the Champlain Lowlands. Continued tilting caused\r\nflooding of the streams, especially in the southern portion of Lake\r\nChamplain, such as the now swampy Otter Creek and its tributary Dead\r\nCreek (see map, Fig. 2). This concludes the story of the Park clays.\r\nFrom the rocks which crop out within a short walking distance of Button\r\nBay State Park a much older segment of geologic history can be studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE OLDER ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks which underlie Button Bay State Park can be seen along the\r\nsmall creek which is located just south of the Park. It is suggested\r\nthat the visitor walk southward (to the right if approaching the road\r\nfrom the lake front) along the main park road until the first culvert\r\nbeneath the road is reached. Looking down the creekbed toward the lake,\r\none can readily see the older rocks (see A, Figure 11). _Fossils_[18]\r\nare found in these tilted rocks which tilt or dip toward the northeast\r\nand “strike” northwestward. Fossils date the rocks underlying Button Bay\r\nState Park as Middle _Ordovician_.[19] The most abundant fossil is a\r\ntrilobite, _Triarthrus_, but, even this ancient _arthropod_[20] is not\r\neasily found in these limestones and limy shales. A sketch of\r\n_Triarthrus_ (that portion found fossilized) appears in Plate 1. These\r\nrocks containing _Triarthrus beckii_ belong to the Stony Point formation\r\nand are of late Sherman Fall or Denmarkian age.\r\n\r\nOne of the jobs of the geologist is to reconstruct the paleogeography\r\n(ancient geography) of a region. The different kinds of rocks present\r\nand their distribution patterns, together with the types of fossil\r\nplants and animals found, tell the geologist of past lands and seas,\r\nwarm and cold climates. The rocks of the Stony Point formation (the\r\nrocks which underlie most of the Park) tell of warm marine waters, a\r\npast sea, bordered by relatively low land areas. The fossils contained\r\nin the Stony Point formation attest to the presence of relatively\r\nshallow marine waters. The fact that these Ordovician rocks are tilted\r\nand broken by faults proves that _major earth movements_[21] took place\r\nsometime after their lithification.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:                 _PLATE 1_]\r\n\r\n  1A, B, C; _Maclurites magnus_ Lesueur (X 0.5).

WELBY—1961\r\n\r\nFrom the north boundary of the Park and along the Lake Champlain\r\nshoreline older and older Ordovician rocks are _encountered_.[22] The\r\nrocks (see geologic map, Fig. 11), primarily tilted marine limestones,\r\ndisplay a variety of fossils, some of which are illustrated in Plate 1.\r\nFigure 12 is a view of the west side of Button Island showing an 18-inch\r\nthick reefy zone in the Orwell limestone. The reefy zone is composed\r\nlargely of tumbled heads of colonial corals and stromatoporoids. A\r\nselected list of reference books and articles, some of which contain\r\nplates picturing Ordovician fossils, is found at the end of this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nOrdovician and older rocks were lifted, folded and faulted during the\r\nTaconic Disturbance. Dramatic evidence for this period of crustal\r\ninstability is seen in the Champlain Thrust, a major series of faults\r\nwhich can be seen east of Button Bay State Park. The evidence for such a\r\nfault system, which is more fully discussed in another pamphlet, is\r\nreadily seen on Mount Philo where older Cambrian rocks have overridden\r\n(been thrust over) younger Ordovician ones.\r\n\r\nAs time passed in the Button Bay region younger and younger sediments\r\nwere deposited over the top of folded and eroded Ordovician rocks. These\r\nsediments became rock and in turn slowly broke into fragments which were\r\ntransported to other areas where they were deposited again as sediments.\r\nThe glaciers passed over, leaving their rock debris behind as they\r\nwasted northward. Marine clays were slowly deposited from the waters of\r\nthe Champlain Sea. Today only the marine clays resting on the beveled\r\nedges of Middle Ordovician rocks can be seen in the Park.\r\n\r\nThe history of the earth is open for all to read. Button Bay State Park\r\ncan tell us only the history which is recorded in its clays and\r\nunderlying rocks. As we have seen, there are certain giant geologic time\r\ngaps in the Park area, but many of these do not exist in other places\r\nand in other Parks. If this pamphlet has stimulated an interest in\r\nfilling in these time gaps through your study of rocks in other places,\r\nthen it has fulfilled its purpose.

Follette, Librarian and Museum Director, Vermont Historical\r\n    Society, Montpelier, Vermont, in a letter to the author dated April\r\n    26, 1961.\r\n\r\n[2]“The governors (and other gentlemen) appear to have included Sir\r\n    Henry Moore, Governor of New York, General Carleton, Governor of\r\n    Quebec, Brig. General Philip Schuyler (and Adolphus Benzel, map\r\n    maker). The activities of these persons on the lake at that time\r\n    were evidently concerned with making observations, primarily to\r\n    determine boundaries.”\r\n\r\n[3]Seely, H. M., 1910, Preliminary Report of the Geology of Addison\r\n    County; Vermont State Geologist, 7th Biennial Report, p. 257-315.\r\n\r\n[4]Concretions consist of concentrations of certain chemical elements\r\n    and compounds into regular or irregular masses. Many times the\r\n    center of a concretion consists of a definite nucleus such as a\r\n    grain of sand or shell fragment. For a general idea of the size and\r\n    shape of the concretions seen along the Button Bay State Park beach\r\n    see Fig. 3 and cover picture.\r\n\r\n[5]These clays were deposited from marine waters which flooded the\r\n    Champlain Valley after the final retreat of the glaciers which\r\n    completely covered New England during the “Great Ice Age” or\r\n    Pleistocene Epoch. The Pleistocene Epoch began approximately one\r\n    million years ago and if the age of the Earth is considered to be\r\n    five billion (5,000 million) years, then, the clays do record recent\r\n    geologic history.\r\n\r\n[6]As the weight of the ice was removed from the Hudson Valley region\r\n    the earth’s crust, in way of adjustment to this removal of weight,\r\n    slowly began to rise. Some geologists doubt whether the removal of\r\n    ice weight alone can account for the crustal rise and propose other\r\n    internal forces as partly or wholly responsible. The fact remains\r\n    that the earth’s crust did rise in this area.\r\n\r\n[7]As the ice retreated, a succession of lakes formed in the Champlain\r\n    Valley. Each lake had a level waterline during its history and\r\n    certain lakeshore features formed, as they do in any present-day\r\n    lake, with respect to each past level water-line. For example,\r\n    ridges of sand and gravel were heaped along the shoreline by lake\r\n    waves. Wave-cut and wave-built flat areas or terraces were formed\r\n    along the margins of lakes or along the sides of islands within a\r\n    lake. Streams entering a lake built deltas by depositing materials\r\n    it had carried down from the surrounding highlands.\r\n\r\n[8]Elevation is measured in feet above the mean sea level of today, with\r\n    mean sea level being zero feet.\r\n\r\n[9]A most impressive view can be gained from any one of the several\r\n    lookout points at the summit level of Mt. Philo. Looking to the\r\n    west, toward Lake Champlain, and south in the direction of Vergennes\r\n    and Button Bay State Park, a three dimensional view of an old lake\r\n    (Lake Vermont) can be seen. In this view the present Lake Champlain\r\n    Lowlands represent the old lake bottom and the numerous hills rising\r\n    above this Lowland were once islands or near-islands which dotted\r\n    the surface of the lake. It takes very little imagination to place\r\n    yourself on the “island of Mt. Philo” and to visualize a boat tied\r\n    to a dock just below the rocky cliffs on which you stand. A trip to\r\n    Mt. Philo with its spectacular view of the Champlain Lowlands (see\r\n    Fig. 6) is recommended.\r\n\r\n[10]One word of caution, the Park authorities may import sand from other\r\n    areas of Vermont to improve the swimming facilities along the beach.\r\n    In this case, the abundant sand on the beach will not constitute the\r\n    “natural beach composition” for Button Bay State Park.\r\n\r\n[11]The blue color is due to the presence of ferrous iron (bivalent\r\n    iron) together with iron compounds in which iron has its higher\r\n    chemical valence (ferric iron). This ferrous iron demands a\r\n    chemically reducing environment for its formation and indicates that\r\n    the clays were deposited in a shallow sea or that they remained for\r\n    some time beneath a stable water-table. They contained a fair\r\n    quantity of decaying organic material.\r\n\r\n[12]The brown color is due to the presence of the ferric hydroxide,\r\n    goethite (HFeO₂).\r\n\r\n[13]This fossil whale is scientifically known as _Delphinapterus\r\n    vermontanus_ (_Thompson_).\r\n\r\n[14]The pelecypods found are scientifically known as _Macoma\r\n    groenlandica_ and _Saxicava rugosa_.\r\n\r\n[15]The size limits of sand lie between 2mm in diameter (largest) and\r\n    ¹/₁₆mm in diameter (smallest). Two millimeters (mm) equals\r\n    approximately ²/₂₅ inches. Fine sand would fall between ¼mm and ⅛mm\r\n    in diameter.\r\n\r\n[16]Convolute beds show their layers thrown into a series of folds (some\r\n    quite irregular) which result from the pressing weight of overlying\r\n    sediments on highly plastic layers beneath. Some feel that these\r\n    folds were the result of actual flowage of the layers in the\r\n    direction of their tilt, and others credit the distorted bedding to\r\n    the pressing weight of large boulders. These dragged across the\r\n    layers while still frozen to overriding glacial ice.\r\n\r\n[17]The author noted both _Macoma groenlandica_ and _Saxicava rugosa_\r\n    (see Fig. 10 and Plate 1, Sketches 3 and 4).\r\n\r\n[18]Fossils are the preserved evidence of past life (animal or plant) as\r\n    found in rocks or sediments, for example, the clams found in the\r\n    clays. They may be direct evidence, such as the actual shells or\r\n    mineralogically replaced shells of long-dead animals; or indirect\r\n    evidence, such as the tracks or trails of animals now preserved in\r\n    rocks.\r\n\r\n[19]Geologic time is divided into four Eras which are designated from\r\n    oldest to youngest: Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic.\r\n    Each of these Eras is divided into geologic Periods of time. The\r\n    Ordovician Period is next to the oldest Period of the Paleozoic Era.\r\n    This Period began some 420 million years ago, and ended\r\n    approximately 360 million years ago.\r\n\r\n[20]Present Arthropods include the insects, spiders and crabs.\r\n    Arthropods, which are invertebrate animals (without backbones), are\r\n    characterized by jointed legs, chitinous outer covering and\r\n    segmented body parts. Trilobites were very numerous in the early\r\n    Paleozoic seas, but became extinct before the end of that Era.\r\n\r\n[21]The folding and the faulting of the Ordovician rocks took place\r\n    sometime between the closing phases of the Ordovician Period and the\r\n    beginning of late Silurian time (between 360 and 330 million years\r\n    ago). Usually these earth movements are ascribed to the Taconic\r\n    Disturbance which took place at the end of the Ordovician Period.\r\n\r\n[22]A walk along the beach in the direction of Button Island or “sickle\r\n    point” (west and then south from the northern boundary of the Park)\r\n    traverses the following geologic formations: the Glens Falls\r\n    limestone which can be seen on Ship Point (actually an island off\r\n    the northern end of the Park); the Orwell limestone, seen on Button\r\n    Island; the Valcour formation which makes up “sickle point”; and the\r\n    Crown Point limestone which is found on the Basin Harbor-side of\r\n    “sickle point.” These rock units belong to the Chazyan Stage (Crown\r\n    Point limestone and Valcour formation) and the next younger\r\n    Mohawkian Stage (Orwell and Glens Falls limestones) of the Middle\r\n    Ordovician Champlainian Series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
