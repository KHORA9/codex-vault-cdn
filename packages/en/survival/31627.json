I have also endeavoured to show, by illustrations carried back\r\ninto later geological epochs, how the volcanic phenomena of the present\r\nday do not differ in kind, though they may in degree, from those of the\r\npast history of our globe. For not only do the modes of eruption of\r\nvolcanic materials in past geological times resemble those of the\r\npresent or human epoch, but the materials themselves are so similar in\r\ncharacter that it is only in consequence of alterations in structure or\r\ncomposition which the original materials have undergone, since their\r\nextrusion, that any important distinctions can be recognised between the\r\nvolcanic products of recent times and those of earlier periods.\r\n\r\nI have, finally, endeavoured to find an answer to two interesting and\r\nimportant questions: (1) Are we now living in an epoch of extraordinary\r\nvolcanic energy?--a question which such terrible outbursts as we have\r\nrecently witnessed in Japan, the Malay Archipelago, and even in Italy,\r\nnaturally suggest; and (2) What is the ultimate cause of volcanic\r\naction? On this latter point I am gratified to find that my conclusions\r\nare in accordance with those expounded by one who has been appropriately\r\ndesignated \"the Nestor of Modern Geology,\" Professor Prestwich.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the study of the structure and composition of\r\nvolcanic rocks, by means of the microscope brought to bear on their\r\ntranslucent sections, has added wonderfully to our knowledge of such\r\nrocks, and has become a special branch of petrological investigation.\r\nCommenced by Sorby, and carried on by Allport, Zirkel, Rosenbusch, Von\r\nLasaulx, Teall, and many more enthusiastic students, it has thrown a\r\nflood of light upon our knowledge of the mutual relations of the\r\ncomponent minerals of igneous masses, the alteration these minerals have\r\nundergone in some cases, and the conditions under which they have been\r\nerupted and consolidated. But nothing that has been observed has tended\r\nmaterially to alter conclusions arrived at by other processes of\r\nreasoning regarding volcanic phenomena, and for these we have to fall\r\nback upon observations conducted in the field on a more or less large\r\nscale, and carried on before, during, and after eruptions. Macroscopic\r\nand microscopic observations have to go hand in hand in the study of\r\nvolcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\n                                        E.

It is, therefore, not surprising that the ancient Greeks,\r\nwho, as well as the Romans, were close observers of the phenomena of\r\nNature, should have investigated the causes of terrestrial disturbances,\r\nand should have come to some conclusions upon them in accordance with\r\nthe light they possessed. These terrible forces presented to the Greeks,\r\nwho clothed all the operations of Nature in poetic imagery and deified\r\nher forces, their poetical and mystical side; and as there was a deity\r\nfor every natural force, so there was one for earthquakes and volcanoes.\r\nVulcan, the deformed son of Juno (whose name bears so strange a\r\nresemblance to that of \"the first artificer in iron\" of the Bible, Tubal\r\nCain), is condemned to pass his days under Mount Etna, fabricating the\r\nthunderbolts of Jove, and arms for the gods and great heroes of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans appear to have held the doctrine of a central fire\r\n(meson pyr) as the source of volcanic phenomena; and in the Dialogues of\r\nPlato allusion is made to a subterranean reservoir of lava, which,\r\naccording to Simplicius, was in accordance with the doctrine of the\r\nPythagoreans which Plato was recounting.[1] Thucydides clearly describes\r\nthe effect of earthquakes upon coast-lines of the Grecian Archipelago,\r\nsimilar to that which took place in the case of the earthquake of\r\nLisbon, the sea first retiring and afterwards inundating the shore.\r\nPliny supposed that it was by earthquake avulsion that islands were\r\nnaturally formed. Thus Sicily was torn from Italy, Cyprus from Syria,\r\nEuboea from Boeotia, and the rest; but this view was previously\r\nenunciated by Aristotle in his \"Peri kosmou,\" where he states that\r\nearthquakes have torn to pieces many parts of the earth, while lands\r\nhave been converted into sea, and that tracts once covered by the sea\r\nhave been converted into dry land.\r\n\r\nBut the most philosophical views regarding terrestrial phenomena are\r\nthose given by Ovid as having been held by Pythagoras (about B.C. 580).\r\nIn the _Metamorphoses_ his views regarding the interchange of land and\r\nsea, the effects of running water in eroding valleys, the growth of\r\ndeltas, the effect of earthquakes in burying cities and diverting\r\nstreams from their sources, are remarkable anticipations of doctrines\r\nnow generally held.[2] But what most concerns us at present are his\r\nviews regarding the changes which have come over volcanic mountains. In\r\nhis day Vesuvius was dormant, but Etna was active; so his illustrations\r\nare drawn from the latter mountain; and in this connection he observes\r\nthat volcanic vents shift their position. There was a time, he says,\r\nwhen Etna was not a burning mountain, and the time will come when it\r\nwill cease to burn; whether it be that some caverns become closed up by\r\nthe movements of the earth, or others opened, or whether the fuel is\r\nfinally exhausted.[3] Strabo may be regarded as having originated the\r\nview, now generally held, that active volcanoes are safety-valves to the\r\nregions in which they are situated. Referring to the tradition recorded\r\nby Pliny, that Sicily was torn from Italy by an earthquake, he observes\r\nthat the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by\r\nearthquakes, since there are now orifices whereby fire and ignited\r\nmatters and waters escape; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna, the\r\nLipari Islands, Ischia, and others were closed up, the imprisoned fire\r\nand wind might have produced far more violent movements.[4]\r\n\r\nThe account of the first recorded eruption of Vesuvius has been\r\ngraphically related by the younger Pliny in his two letters to Tacitus,\r\nto which I shall have occasion to refer further on.[5] These bring down\r\nthe references to volcanic phenomena amongst ancient authors to the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era; from all of which we may infer that\r\nthe more enlightened philosophers of antiquity had a general idea that\r\neruptions had their origin in a central fire within the interior of the\r\nearth, that volcanic mountains were liable to become dormant for long\r\nperiods, and afterwards to break out into renewed activity, that there\r\nexisted a connection between volcanic action and earthquakes, and that\r\nvolcanoes are safety-valves for the regions around.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary that I should pursue the historical sketch further.\r\nThose who wish to know the views of writers of the Middle Ages will find\r\nthem recorded by Sir Charles Lyell.[6] The long controversy carried on\r\nduring the latter part of the eighteenth century between \"Neptunists,\"\r\nled by Werner on the one side, and \"Vulcanists,\" led by Hutton and\r\nPlayfair on the other, regarding the origin of such rocks as granite and\r\nbasalt, was finally brought to a close by the triumph of the\r\n\"Vulcanists,\" who demonstrated that such rocks are the result of igneous\r\nfusion; and that in the cases of basalt and its congeners, they are\r\nbeing extruded from volcanic vents at the present day. The general\r\nprinciples for the classification of rocks as recognised in modern\r\nscience may be regarded as having been finally established by James\r\nHutton, of Edinburgh, in his _Theory of the Earth_,[7] while they were\r\nillustrated and defended by Professor Playfair in his work entitled,\r\n_Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth_,[8] although other\r\nobservers, such as Desmarest, Collini, and Guettard, had in other\r\ncountries come to very clear views on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the more important works on the phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes published during the present century:--[9]\r\n\r\n1. Poulett Scrope, F.R.S., _Considerations on Volcanoes_ (1825). This\r\nwork is dedicated to Lyell, his fellow-worker in the same department of\r\nscience, and was undertaken, as he says, \"in order to help to dispel\r\nthat signal delusion as to the mode of action of the subtelluric forces\r\nwith which the Elevation-Crater theory had mystified the geological\r\nworld.\" The second edition was published in 1872.\r\n\r\n2. This was followed by the admirable work, _On the Extinct Volcanoes\r\nof Central France_, published in 1826 (2nd edition, 1858), and is one of\r\nthe most complete monographs on a special volcanic district ever\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n3. Dr. Samuel Hibbert, _History of the Extinct Volcanoes of the Basin of\r\nNeuwied on the Lower Rhine_ (1832). Dr. Hibbert's work is one of\r\nremarkable merit, if we consider the time at which it was written. For\r\nnot only does it give a clear and detailed account of the volcanic\r\nphenomena of the Eifel and the Lower Rhine, but it anticipates the\r\nprinciples upon which modern writers account for the formation of river\r\nvalleys and other physical features; and in working out the physical\r\nhistory of the Rhine valley below Mainz, and its connection with the\r\nextinct volcanoes which are found on both banks of that river, he has\r\ntaken very much the same line of reasoning which was some years\r\nafterwards adopted by Sir A. Ramsay when dealing with the same subject.\r\nIt does not appear that the latter writer was aware of Dr. Hibbert's\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\n4.

Boulanger (1836); _Geognostische\r\nReise_ (Berlin, 1809), 2 vols.; and _Reise durch Italien_ (1809). From a\r\nlarge number of writings on volcanoes by this distinguished traveller,\r\nwhom Alexander von Humboldt calls \"dem geistreichen Forscher der Natur,\"\r\nthe above are selected as being the most important. That on the Canaries\r\nis accompanied by a large atlas, in which the volcanoes of Teneriffe,\r\nPalma, and Lancerote, with some others, are elaborately represented, and\r\nare considered to bear out the author's views regarding the formation\r\nof volcanic cones by elevation or upheaval. The works dealing with the\r\nvolcanic phenomena of Central and Southern Italy are also written with\r\nthe object, in part at least, of illustrating and supporting the same\r\ntheoretical views; with these we have to deal in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n5.

In this work the author gives detailed descriptions of\r\nalmost all the known volcanic districts of the globe, and defends what\r\nis called \"the chemical theory of volcanic action\"--a theory at one time\r\nheld by Sir Humphrey Davy.\r\n\r\n6. Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, _Der Ætna_. This work possesses\r\na melancholy interest from the fact that its distinguished author did\r\nnot live to see its publication. Von Waltershausen, having spent several\r\nyears in making an elaborate survey of Etna, produced an atlas\r\ncontaining numerous detailed maps, views, and drawings of this mountain\r\nand its surroundings, which were published at Weimar by Engelmann in\r\n1858. A description in MS. to accompany the atlas was also prepared, but\r\nbefore it was printed, the author died, on the 16th October 1876. The\r\nMS. having been put into the hands of the late Professor Arnold von\r\nLasaulx by the publisher of the atlas, it was subsequently brought out\r\nunder the care of this distinguished petrologist, who was so fully\r\nfitted for an undertaking of this kind.\r\n\r\n7. Sir Charles Lyell in his _Principles of Geology_[10] devotes several\r\nchapters to the consideration of volcanic phenomena, in which, being in\r\nharmony with the views of his friend, Poulett Scrope, he combats the\r\n\"elevation theory\" of Von Buch, as applied to the formation of volcanic\r\nmountains, holding that they are built up of ashes, stones, and scoriæ\r\nblown out of the throat of the volcano and piled around the orifice in a\r\nconical form. Together with these materials are sheets of lava extruded\r\nin a molten condition from the sides or throat of the crater itself.\r\n\r\n8. Professor J. W. Judd, F.R.S., in his able work entitled, _Volcanoes:\r\nWhat they are, and what they teach_,[11] has furnished the student of\r\nvulcanicity with a very complete manual of a general character on the\r\nsubject. The author, having extensive personal acquaintance with the\r\nvolcanoes of the south of Europe and the volcanic rocks of the British\r\nIsles, was well equipped for undertaking a work of the kind; and in it\r\nhe supports the views of Lyell and Scrope regarding the mode of\r\nformation of volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\n9. Sir Archibald Geikie, F.R.S., in his elaborate monograph[12] on the\r\nTertiary Volcanic Rocks of the British Isles, has recorded his views\r\nregarding the origin and succession of the plateau basalts and\r\nassociated rocks over the region extending from the north of Ireland to\r\nthe Inner Hebrides; and in dealing with these districts in the following\r\npages I have made extensive use of his observations and conclusions.\r\n\r\n10. _Report published by the Royal Society on the Eruption of\r\nKrakatoa_--drawn up by several authors (1885)--and the work on the same\r\nsubject by Chev.

Yet this is very far from being the fact, as some\r\nvarieties of rock, such as quartzite, not unfrequently assume this\r\nshape. Of such we have an example in the case of Errigal, a quartzite\r\nmountain in Donegal, nearly 3000 feet high, which bears a very near\r\napproach in form to a perfect cone or pyramid, and yet is in no way\r\nconnected, as regards its origin or structure, with volcanic phenomena.\r\nAnother remarkable instance is that of Schehallion in Scotland, also\r\ncomposed of quartz-rock; and others may be found amongst the ranges of\r\nIslay and Jura, described by Sir A. Geikie.[1]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, such exceptions, which might be greatly\r\nmultiplied, the majority of cone-shaped mountains over the globe have a\r\nvolcanic origin.[2] The origin of this form in each case is entirely\r\ndistinct. In the case of quartzite mountains, the conical form is due to\r\natmospheric influences acting on a rock of uniform composition,\r\ntraversed by numerous joints and fissures crossing each other at obtuse\r\nangles, along which the rock breaks up and falls away, so that the sides\r\nare always covered by angular shingle forming slopes corresponding to\r\nthe angle of friction of the rock in question. In the case of a volcanic\r\nmountain, however, the same form is due either to accumulation of\r\nfragmental material piled around the cup-shaped hollow, or crater, which\r\nis usually placed at the apex of the cone, and owing to which it is\r\nbluntly terminated, or else to the welling up from beneath of viscous\r\nmatter in the manner presently to be described.\r\n\r\n_Views of Sir Humphrey Davy and L. von Buch._--The question how a\r\nvolcanic cone came to be formed was not settled without a long\r\ncontroversy carried on by several naturalists of eminence. Some of the\r\nearlier writers of modern times on the subject of vulcanicity--such as\r\nSir Humphrey Davy and Leopold von Buch--maintained that the conical form\r\nwas due to upheaval by a force acting from below at a central focus,\r\nwhereby the materials of which the mountain is formed were forced to\r\nassume a _quâ-quâ versal_ position--that is, a position in which the\r\nmaterials dip away from the central focus in every direction. But this\r\nview, originally contested by Scrope and Lyell, has now been generally\r\nabandoned. It will be seen on reflection that if a series of strata of\r\nashes, tuff, and lava, originally horizontal, or nearly so, were to be\r\nforced upwards into a conical form by a central force, the result would\r\nbe the formation of a series of radiating fissures ever widening from\r\nthe circumference towards the focus. In the case of a large mountain\r\nsuch fissures, whether filled with lava or otherwise, would be of great\r\nbreadth towards the focus, or central crater, and could not fail to make\r\nmanifest beyond dispute their mechanical origin. But no fissures of the\r\nkind here referred to are, as a matter of fact, to be observed. Those\r\nwhich do exist are too insignificant and too irregular in direction to\r\nbe ascribed to such an origin; so that the views of Von Buch and Davy\r\nmust be dismissed, as being unsupported by observation, and as untenable\r\non dynamical grounds. As a matter of fact, the \"elevatory theory,\" or\r\nthe \"elevation-crater theory,\" as it is called by Scrope, has been\r\nalmost universally abandoned by writers on vulcanicity.\r\n\r\n_Principal Varieties of Volcanic Mountains as regards Form._--But whilst\r\nrejecting the \"elevatory theory,\" it is necessary to bear in mind that\r\nvolcanic cones and dome-shaped elevations have been formed in several\r\ndistinct ways, giving rise to varieties of structure essentially\r\ndifferent. Two of the more general of these varieties of form, the\r\ncrater-cone and the dome, are found in some districts, as in Auvergne,\r\nside by side. The crater-cone consists of beds or sheets of ashes,\r\nlapilli, and slag piled up in a conical form, with a central crater (or\r\ncup) containing the principal pipe through which these materials have\r\nbeen erupted; the dome, of a variety of trachytic lava, which has been\r\nextruded in a molten, or viscous, condition from a central pipe, and in\r\nsuch cases there is no distinct crater. There are other forms of\r\nvolcanic mountains, such as those built up of basaltic matter, of which\r\nI shall have to speak hereafter, but the two former varieties are the\r\nmost prevalent; and we may now proceed to consider the conditions under\r\nwhich the crater-cone volcanoes have been formed.\r\n\r\n_Crateriform Volcanic Cones._--Of this class nearly all the active\r\nvolcanoes of the Mediterranean region--Etna, Vesuvius, Stromboli, and\r\nthe Lipari Islands--may be considered as representatives. They consist\r\nessentially of masses of fragmental material, which have from time to\r\ntime been blown out of an orifice and piled up around with more or less\r\nregularity (according to the force exerted, and direction of the\r\nprevalent winds), alternating with sheets of lava. In this way mountains\r\nseveral thousand feet in height and of vast horizontal extent are\r\nformed. The fragmental materials thus accumulated are of all sizes, from\r\nthe finest dust up to blocks many tons in weight, the latter being\r\nnaturally piled around nearest to the orifice. The fine dust, blown high\r\ninto the air by the explosive force of the gases and vapours, is often\r\ncarried to great distances by the prevalent winds. Thus during the\r\neruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 472 showers of ashes, carried high into the\r\nair by the westerly wind, fell over Constantinople at a distance of 750\r\nmiles.[3]\r\n\r\nThese loose, or partially consolidated, fragmental materials are rudely\r\nstratified, and slope downwards and outwards from the edge of the\r\ncrater, so as to present the appearance of what is known as \"the dip\" of\r\nstratified deposits which have been upraised from the horizontal\r\nposition by terrestrial forces. It was this excentrical arrangement\r\nwhich gave rise to the supposition that such volcanic ash-beds had been\r\ntilted up by a force acting in the direction of the volcanic throat, or\r\norifice of eruption. The interior wall of Monte di Somma, the original\r\ncrater of Vesuvius, presents a good illustration of such fragmental\r\nbeds. I shall have occasion further on to describe more fully the\r\nstructure of this remarkable mountain; so that it will suffice to say\r\nhere that this old prehistoric crater, the walls of which enclose the\r\nmodern cone of Vesuvius, is seen to be formed of irregular beds of ash,\r\nscoriæ, and fragmental masses, traversed by numerous dykes of lava, and\r\nsloping away outwards towards the surrounding plains.\r\n\r\nOf similar materials are the flanks of Etna composed, even at great\r\ndistances from the central crater; the beds of ash and agglomerate\r\nsometimes alternating with sheets of solidified lava and traversed by\r\ndykes of similar material of later date, injected from below through\r\nfissures formed during periods of eruptive energy. Numerous similar\r\nexamples are to be observed in the Auvergne region of Central France and\r\nthe Eifel. And here we find remarkable cases of \"breached cones,\" or\r\ncraters, which will require some special description. Standing on the\r\nsummit of the Puy de Dôme, and looking northwards or southwards, the eye\r\nwanders over a tract formed of dome-shaped hills and of extinct\r\ncrater-cones rising from a granitic platform. But what is most peculiar\r\nin the scene is the ruptured condition of a large number of the cones\r\nwith craters. In such cases the wall of the crater has been broken down\r\non one side, and we observe that a stream of lava has been poured out\r\nthrough the breach and overflowed the plain below. The cause of this\r\nbreached form is sufficiently obvious. In such cases there has been an\r\nexplosion of ashes, stones, and scoriæ from the volcanic throat, by\r\nwhich a cone-shaped hill with a crater has been built up. This has been\r\nfollowed by molten lava welling up through the throat, and gradually\r\nfilling the crater. But, as the lava is much more dense than the\r\nmaterial of which the crater wall is composed, the pressure of the lava\r\noutwards has become too great for the resistance of the wall, which\r\nconsequently has given way at its weakest part and, a breach being\r\nformed, the molten matter has flowed out in a stream which has inundated\r\nthe country lying at the base of the cone. In one instance mentioned by\r\nScrope, the original upper limit of the lake of molten lava has left its\r\nmark in the form of a ring of slag on the inside of the breached\r\ncrater.[4]\r\n\r\n_Craterless Domes._--These differ essentially both in form and\r\ncomposition from those just described, and have their typical\r\nrepresentatives in the Auvergne district, though not without their\r\nanalogues elsewhere, as in the case of Chimborazo, in South America, one\r\nof the loftiest volcanic mountains in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Cotopaxi, a volcano of the Cordilleras of\r\nQuito, still active, and covered by snow down to a level of 14,800 feet.\r\nBelow this is a zone of naked rock, succeeded by another of forest\r\nvegetation. Owing to the continuous extrusion of lava from the crater,\r\nthe cone is being gradually built up of fresh material, and the crater\r\nis comparatively small in consequence.--(A diagrammatic view after A.\r\nvon Humboldt.)]\r\n\r\nTaking the Puy de Dôme, Petit Suchet, Cliersou, Grand Sarcoui in\r\nAuvergne, and the Mamelon in the Isle of Bourbon as illustrations, we\r\nhave in all these cases a group of volcanic hills, dome-shaped and\r\ndestitute of craters, the summits being rounded or slightly flattened.\r\nWe also observe that the flanks rise more abruptly from their bases, and\r\ncontrast in outline with the graceful curve of the crater cones. The\r\ndome-shaped volcanoes are generally composed of felsitic matter, whether\r\ndomite, trachyte, or andesite, which has been extruded in a molten or\r\nviscous condition from some orifice or fissure in the earth's crust, and\r\nbeing piled up and spreading outwards, necessarily assumes such a form\r\nas that of a dome, as has been shown by experiment on a small scale by\r\nDr. E. Reyer, of Grätz.[5] The contrast between the two forms (those of\r\nthe dome and the crater-cone) is exemplified in the case of the Grand\r\nSarcoui and its neighbours. The former is composed of a species of\r\ntrachyte; the latter of ashes and fragmental matter which have been\r\nblown out of their respective vents of eruption into the air, and piled\r\nup and around in a crateriform manner with sides of gradually\r\ndiminishing slope outwards, thus giving rise to the characteristic\r\nvolcanic curve. The two varieties here referred to, contrasting in form,\r\ncomposition, and colour of material, can be clearly recognised from the\r\nsummit of the Puy de Dôme, which rises by a head and shoulders above its\r\nfellows, and thus affords an advantageous standpoint from which to\r\ncompare the various forms of this remarkable group of volcanic\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nCotopaxi (Fig. 2) has been generally supposed to be a dome; but Whymper,\r\nwho ascended the mountain in 1880, shows that it is a cone with a\r\ncrater, 2,300 feet in largest diameter. He determined the height to be\r\n19,613 feet above the ocean. Its real elevation above the sea is\r\nsomewhat masked, owing to the fact that it rises from the high plain of\r\nTapia, which is itself 8,900 feet above the sea surface. The smaller\r\npeak on the right (Fig. 2) is that of Carihuairazo, which reaches an\r\nelevation of over 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\nChimborazo, in Columbia, province of Quito, is one of the loftiest of\r\nthe chain of the Andes, and is situated in lat. 1° 30' S., long. 78° 58'\r\nW. Though not in a state of activity, it is wholly composed of volcanic\r\nmaterial, and reaches an elevation of over 20,000 feet above the ocean;\r\nits sides being covered by a sheet of permanent snow to a level of 2,600\r\nfeet below the summit.[6] Seen from the shores of the Pacific, after the\r\nlong rains of winter, it presents a magnificent spectacle, \"when the\r\ntransparency of the air is increased, and its enormous circular summit\r\nis seen projected upon the deep azure blue of the equatorial sky. The\r\ngreat rarity of the air through which the tops of the Andes are seen\r\nadds much to the splendour of the snow, and aids the magical effect of\r\nits reflection.\"\r\n\r\nChimborazo was ascended by Humboldt and Bonpland in 1802 almost to the\r\nsummit; but at a height of 19,300 feet by barometrical measurement,\r\ntheir further ascent was arrested by a wide chasm. Boussingault, in\r\ncompany with Colonel Hall, accomplished the ascent as far as the foot of\r\nthe mass of columnar \"trachyte,\" the upper surface of which, covered by\r\na dome of snow, forms the summit of the mountain. The whole mass of the\r\nmountain consists of volcanic rock, varieties of andesite; there is no\r\ntrace of a crater, nor of any fragmental materials, such as are usually\r\nejected from a volcanic vent of eruption.[7]\r\n\r\n_Lava Crater-Cones._--A third form of volcanic mountain is that which\r\nhas been built up by successive eruptions of basic lava, such as basalt\r\nor dolerite, when in a molten condition. These are very rare, and the\r\nslope of the sides depends on the amount of original viscosity. Where\r\nthe lava is highly fused its slope will be slight, but if in a viscous\r\ncondition, successive outpourings from the orifice, unable to reach the\r\nbase of the mountain, will tend to form a cone with increasing slope\r\nupwards. Mauna Loa and Kilauea, in the Hawaiian Group, according to\r\nProfessor J. D. Dana, are basalt volcanoes in a normal state. They have\r\ndistinct craters, and the material of which the mountain is formed is\r\nbasalt or dolerite. The volcano of Rangitoto in Auckland, New Zealand,\r\nappears to belong to this class.\r\n\r\nBasalt is the most fusible of volcanic rocks, owing to the augite and\r\nmagnetite it contains, so that it spreads out with a very slight slope\r\nwhen highly fused. Trachyte, on the other hand, is the least fusible\r\nowing to the presence of orthoclase felspar, or quartz; so that the\r\nvolcanic domes formed of this material stand at a higher angle from the\r\nhorizon than those of basaltic cones.\r\n\r\n[1] _Scenery and Geology of Scotland_ (1865), p. 214.\r\n\r\n[2] Humboldt says: \"The form of isolated conical mountains, as those of\r\nVesuvius, Etna, the Peak of Teneriffe, Tunguagua, and Cotopaxi, is\r\ncertainly the shape most commonly observed in volcanoes all over the\r\nglobe.\"--_Views of Nature_, translated by E. C. Otté and H. G. Bohn\r\n(1850).\r\n\r\n[3] It is supposed that after the disastrous explosion of Krakatoa in\r\n1883 the fine dust carried into the higher regions of the atmosphere was\r\ncarried round almost the entire globe, and remained suspended for a\r\nlengthened period, as described in a future page.\r\n\r\n[4] Another remarkable case is mentioned and figured by Judd, where one\r\nof the Lipari Isles, composed of pumice and rising out of the\r\nMediterranean, has been breached by a lava-stream of obsidian.--_Loc.\r\ncit._, p. 123.\r\n\r\n[5] Reyer has produced such dome-shaped masses by forcing a quantity of\r\nplaster of Paris in a pasty condition up through an orifice in a board;\r\nreferred to by Judd, _loc. cit._, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[6] Whymper determined the height to be 20,498 feet; Reiss and Stübel\r\nmake it 20,703 feet. Whymper thinks there may be a crater concealed\r\nbeneath the dome of snow.--_Travels amongst the Great Andes of the\r\nEquator_, by Edward Whymper (1892).\r\n\r\n[7] Whymper states that there is a prevalent idea that Cotopaxi and a\r\nvolcano called Sangai act as safety-valves to each other. Sangai reaches\r\nan elevation (according to Reiss and Stübel) of 17,464 feet, and sends\r\nintermittent jets of steam high into the air, spreading out into vast\r\ncumulus clouds, which float away southwards, and ultimately\r\ndisappear.--_Ibid._, p. 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLINES AND GROUPS OF ACTIVE VOLCANIC VENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe globe is girdled by a chain of volcanic mountains in a state of\r\ngreater or less activity, which may perhaps be considered a girdle of\r\nsafety for the whole world, through which the masses of molten matter in\r\na state of high pressure beneath the crust find a way of escape; and\r\nthus the structure of the globe is preserved from even greater\r\nconvulsions than those which from time to time take place at various\r\npoints on its surface. This girdle is partly terrestrial, partly\r\nsubmarine; and commencing at Mount Erebus, near the Antarctic Pole,\r\nranging through South Shetland Isle, Cape Horn, the Andes of South\r\nAmerica, the Isthmus of Panama, then through Central America and Mexico,\r\nand the Rocky Mountains to Kamtschatka, the Aleutian Islands, the\r\nKuriles, the Japanese, the Philippines, New Guinea, and New Zealand,\r\nreaches the Antarctic Circle by the Balleny Islands. This girdle sends\r\noff branches at several points. (See Map, p. 23.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Volcanic cone of Orizaba (Cittaltepeth), in\r\nMexico, now extinct; the upper part snow-clad, and at its base forest\r\nvegetation; it reaches a height of 16,302 Parisian feet above the\r\nsea.--(After A. von Humboldt.)]\r\n\r\n(_a._) The linear arrangement of active or dormant volcanic vents has\r\nbeen pointed out by Humboldt, Von Buch, Daubeny, and other writers. The\r\ngreat range of burning mountains of the Andes of Chili, Peru, Bolivia,\r\nand Mexico, that of the Aleutian Islands, of Kamtschatka and the Kurile\r\nIslands, extending southwards into the Philippines, and the branching\r\nrange of the Sunda Islands are well-known examples. That of the West\r\nIndian Islands, ranging from Grenada through St. Vincent, St. Lucia,\r\nMartinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Nevis, and St. Eustace,[1]\r\nis also a remarkable example of the linear arrangement of volcanic\r\nmountains. On tracing these ranges on a map of the world[2] (Map, p.\r\n23), it will be observed that they are either strings of islands, or lie\r\nin proximity to the ocean; and hence the view was naturally entertained\r\nby some writers that oceanic water, or at any rate that of a large lake\r\nor sea, was a necessary agent in the production of volcanic eruptions.\r\nThis view seems to receive further corroboration from the fact that the\r\ninterior portions of the continents and large islands such as Australia\r\nare destitute of volcanoes in action, with the remarkable exceptions of\r\nMounts Kenia and Kilimanjaro in Central Africa, and a few others. It is\r\nalso very significant in this connection that many of the volcanoes now\r\nextinct, or at least dormant, both in Europe and Asia, appear to have\r\nbeen in proximity to sheets of water during the period of activity. Thus\r\nthe old volcanoes of the Haurân, east of the Jordan, appear to have been\r\nactive at the period when the present Jordan valley was filled with\r\nwater to such an extent as to constitute a lake two hundred miles in\r\nlength, but which has now shrunk back to within the present limits of\r\nthe Dead Sea.[3] Again, at the period when the extinct volcanoes of\r\nCentral France were in active operation, an extensive lake overspread\r\nthe tract lying to the east of the granitic plateau on which the craters\r\nand domes are planted, now constituting the rich and fertile plain of\r\nClermont.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Of The World Showing Active And Extinct Volcanoes\r\n(Large Dots)]\r\n\r\nSuch instances are too significant to allow us to doubt that water in\r\nsome form is very generally connected with volcanic operations; but it\r\ndoes not follow that it was necessary to the original formation of\r\nvolcanic vents, whether linear or sporadic. If this were so, the extinct\r\nvolcanoes of the British Isles would still be active, as they are close\r\nto the sea-margin, and no volcano would now be active which is not near\r\nto some large sheet of water. But Jorullo, one of the great active\r\nvolcanoes of Mexico, lies no less than 120 miles from the ocean, and\r\nCotopaxi, in Ecuador, is nearly equally distant. Kilimanjaro, 18,881\r\nfeet high, and Kenia, in the equatorial regions of Central Africa, are\r\nabout 150 miles from the Victoria Nyanza, and a still greater distance\r\nfrom the ocean; and Mount Demavend, in Persia, which rises to an\r\nelevation of 18,464 feet near the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, a\r\nvolcanic mountain of the first magnitude, is now extinct or dormant.[4]\r\nSuch facts as these all tend to show that although water may be an\r\naccessory of volcanic eruptions, it is not in all cases essential; and\r\nwe are obliged, therefore, to have recourse to some other theory of\r\nvolcanic action differing from that which would attribute it to the\r\naccess of water to highly heated or molten matter within the crust of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Leopold von Buch on Rents and Fissures in the Earth's\r\nCrust._--The view of Leopold von Buch, who considered that the great\r\nlines of volcanic mountains above referred to rise along the borders of\r\nrents, or fissures, in the earth's crust, is one which is inherently\r\nprobable, and is in keeping with observation. That the crust of the\r\nglobe is to a remarkable extent fissured and torn in all directions is a\r\nphenomenon familiar to all field geologists. Such rents and fissures are\r\noften accompanied by displacement of the strata, owing to which the\r\ncrust has been vertically elevated on one side or lowered on the other,\r\nand such displacements (or \"faults\") sometimes amount to thousands of\r\nfeet. It is only occasionally, however, that such fractures are\r\naccompanied by the extrusion of molten matter; and in the North of\r\nEngland and Scotland dykes of igneous rock, such as basalt, which run\r\nacross the country for many miles in nearly straight lines, often cut\r\nacross the faults, and are only rarely coincident with them.\r\nNevertheless, it can scarcely be a question that the grand chain of\r\nvolcanic mountains which stretches almost continuously along the Andes\r\nof South America, and northwards through Mexico, has been piled up along\r\nthe line of a system of fissures in the fundamental rocks parallel to\r\nthe coast, though not actually coincident therewith.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _The Cordilleras of Quito._--The structure and arrangement of the\r\nCordilleras of Quito, for example, are eminently suggestive of\r\narrangement along lines of fissure. As shown by Alexander von\r\nHumboldt,[5] the volcanic mountains are disposed in two parallel chains,\r\nwhich run side by side for a distance of over 500 miles northwards into\r\nthe State of Columbia, and enclose between them the high plains of Quito\r\nand Lacunga. Along the eastern chain are the great cones of El Altar,\r\nrising to an elevation of 16,383 feet above the ocean, and having an\r\nenormous crater apparently dormant or extinct, and covered with snow;\r\nthen Cotopaxi (Fig. 2), its sides covered with snow, and sending forth\r\nfrom its crater several columns of smoke; then Guamani and Cayambe\r\n(19,000 feet), huge truncated cones apparently extinct; these constitute\r\nthe eastern chain of volcanic heights. The western chain contains even\r\nloftier mountains. Here we find the gigantic Chimborazo, an extinct\r\nvolcano whose summit is white with snow; Carihuairazo[6] and Illiniza, a\r\nlofty pointed peak like the Matterhorn; Corazon, a snow-clad dome,\r\nreaching a height of 15,871 feet; Atacazo and Pichincha, the latter an\r\nextinct volcano reaching an elevation of 15,920 feet; such is the\r\nwestern chain, remarkable for its straightness, the volcanic cones being\r\nplanted in one grand procession from south to north. This rectilinear\r\narrangement of the western chain, only a little less conspicuous in the\r\neastern, is very suggestive of a line of fracture in the crust beneath.\r\nAnd when we contemplate the prodigious quantity of matter included\r\nwithin the limits of these colossal domes and their environments, all of\r\nwhich has been extruded from the internal reservoirs, we gain some idea\r\nof the manner in which the contracting crust disposes of the matter it\r\ncan no longer contain.[7]\r\n\r\nBetween the volcanoes of Quito and those of Peru there is an intervening\r\nspace of fourteen degrees of latitude. This is occupied by the Andes,\r\nregarding the structure of which we have not much information except\r\nthat at this part of its course it is not volcanic. But from Arequipa in\r\nPeru (lat. 16° S.), an active volcano, we find a new series of volcanic\r\nmountains continued southwards through Tacora (19,740 feet), then\r\nfurther south the more or less active vents of Sajama (22,915 feet),\r\nCoquina, Tutupaca, Calama, Atacama, Toconado, and others, forming an\r\nalmost continuous range with that part of the desert of Atacama\r\npertaining to Chili. Through this country we find the volcanic range\r\nappearing at intervals; and still more to the southwards it is doubtless\r\nconnected with the volcanoes of Patagonia, north of the Magellan\r\nStraits, and of Tierra del Fuego. Mr. David Forbes considers that this\r\ngreat range of volcanic mountains, lying nearly north and south,\r\ncorresponds to a line of fracture lying somewhat to the east of the\r\nrange.[8]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Other Volcanic Chains._--A similar statement in all probability\r\napplies to the systems of volcanic mountains of the Aleutian Isles,\r\nKamtschatka, the Kuriles, the Philippines, and Sunda Isles. Nor can\r\nit be reasonably doubted that the western American coast-line has\r\nto a great extent been determined, or marked out, by such lines of\r\ndisplacement; for, as Darwin has shown, the whole western coast of South\r\nAmerica, for a distance of between 2000 and 3000 miles south of the\r\nEquator, has undergone an upward movement in very recent times--that is,\r\nwithin the period of living marine shells--during which period the\r\nvolcanoes have been in activity.[9]\r\n\r\n(_e._) _The Kurile Islands._--This chain may also be cited in evidence\r\nof volcanic action along fissure lines. It connects the volcanoes of\r\nKamtschatka with those of Japan, and the linear arrangement is apparent.\r\nIn the former peninsula Erman counted no fewer than thirteen active\r\nvolcanic mountains rising to heights of 12,000 to 15,000 feet above the\r\nsea.[10] In the chain of the Kuriles Professor John Milne counted\r\nfifty-two well-defined volcanoes, of which nine, perhaps more, are\r\ncertainly active.[11] They are not so high as those of Kamtschatka; but,\r\non the other hand, they rise from very deep oceanic waters, and have\r\nbeen probably built up from the sea bottom by successive eruptions of\r\ntuff, lava, and ash. According to the view of Professor Milne, the\r\nvolcanoes of the Kurile chain are fast becoming extinct.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Volcanic Groups._--Besides the volcanic vents arranged in lines,\r\nof which we have treated above, there are a large number, both active\r\nand extinct, which appear to be disposed in groups, or sporadically\r\ndistributed, over various portions of the earth's surface. I say _appear\r\nto be_, because this sporadic distribution may really be resolvable (at\r\nleast in some cases) into linear distribution for short distances. Thus\r\nthe Neapolitan Group, which might at first sight seem to be arranged\r\nround Vesuvius as a centre, really resolves itself into a line of active\r\nand extinct vents of eruption, ranging across Italy from the Tyrrhenian\r\nSea to the Adriatic, through Ischia, Procida, Monte Nuovo and the\r\nPhlegræan Fields, Vesuvius, and Mount Vultur.[12] Again, the extinct\r\nvolcanoes of Central France, which appear to form an isolated group,\r\nindicate, when viewed in detail, a linear arrangement ranging from north\r\nto south.[13] Another region over which extinct craters are distributed\r\nlies along the banks of the Rhine, above Bonn and the Moselle; a fourth\r\nin Hungary; a fifth in Asia Minor and Northern Palestine; and a sixth in\r\nCentral Asia around Lake Balkash. These are all continental, and the\r\nlinear distribution is not apparent.\r\n\r\n[1] For an interesting account of this range of volcanic islands see\r\nKingsley's _At Last_. The grandest volcanic peak is that of Guadeloupe,\r\nrising to a height of 5000 feet above the ocean, amidst a group of\r\nfourteen extinct craters. But the most active vent of the range is the\r\nSouffrière of St. Vincent. In the eruption of 1812 this mountain sent\r\nforth clouds of pumice, scoriæ and ashes, some of which were carried by\r\nan upper counter current to Barbados, one hundred miles to the eastward,\r\ncovering the surface with volcanic dust to a depth of several inches.\r\n\r\n[2] An excellent, and perhaps the most recent, map of this kind is that\r\ngiven by Professor Prestwich in his _Geology_, vol. i. p. 216. One on a\r\nlarger scale is that by Keith Johnston in his _Physical Atlas_.\r\n\r\n[3] _Memoir on the Physical Geology and Geography of Arabia Petræa,\r\nPalestine_, etc., published for the Committee of the Palestine\r\nExploration Fund (1886), p. 113, etc.\r\n\r\n[4] This mountain was ascended in 1837 by Mr. Taylor Thomson, who found\r\nthe summit covered with sulphur, and from a cone fumes at a high\r\ntemperature issued forth, but there was no eruption.--_Journ. Roy.\r\nGeographical Soc._, vol. viii. p. 109.\r\n\r\n[5] Humboldt, _Atlas der Kleineren Schriften_ (1853).\r\n\r\n[6] Ascended by Whymper June 29, 1880. He found the elevation to be\r\n16,515 feet.\r\n\r\n[7] The arrangement of the volcanoes of Peru and Bolivia is also\r\nsuggestive of a double line of fissure, while those of Chili suggest one\r\nsingle line. The volcanoes of Arequipa, in the southern part of Peru,\r\nare dealt with by Dr. F. H. Hatch, in his inaugural dissertation, _Ueber\r\ndie Gesteine der Vulcan-Gruppe von Arequipa_ (Wien, 1886). The volcanoes\r\nrise to great elevations, having their summits capped by snow. The\r\nvolcano of Charchani, lying to the north of Arequipa, reaches an\r\nelevation of 18,382 Parisian feet. That of Pichupichu reaches a height\r\nof 17,355 Par. feet. The central cone of Misti has been variously\r\nestimated to range from 17,240 to 19,000 Par. feet. The rocks of which\r\nthe mountains are composed consist of varieties of andesite.\r\n\r\n[8] D.

E. of Ireland, the Inner Hebrides\r\nand Iceland, of which the central vents are extinct or dormant, the\r\nextremities active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMID-OCEAN VOLCANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oceanic Islands._--By far the most extensive regions with sporadically\r\ndistributed volcanic vents, both active and extinct, are those which are\r\noverspread by the waters of the ocean, where the vents emerge in the\r\nform of islands. These are to be found in all the great oceans, the\r\nAtlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian; but are especially numerous over\r\nthe central Pacific region. As Kotzebue and subsequently Darwin have\r\npointed out, all the islands of the Pacific are either coral-reefs or of\r\nvolcanic origin; and many of these rise from great depths; that is to\r\nsay, from depths of 1000 to 2000 fathoms. It is unnecessary here to\r\nattempt to enumerate all these islands which rise in solitary grandeur\r\nfrom the surface of the ocean, and are the scenes of volcanic\r\noperations; a few may, however, be enumerated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--The Peak of Teneriffe (Pic de Teyde) as seen\r\nfrom the ocean.--(From a photograph.)]\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Iceland._--In the Atlantic, Iceland first claims notice, owing\r\nto the magnitude and number of its active vents and the variety of the\r\naccompanying phenomena, especially the geysers. As Lyell has\r\nobserved,[1] with the exception of Etna and Vesuvius, the most complete\r\nchronological records of a series of eruptions in existence are those\r\nof Iceland, which come down from the ninth century of our era, and which\r\ngo to show that since the twelfth century there has never been an\r\ninterval of more than forty years without either an eruption or a great\r\nearthquake. So intense is the volcanic energy in this island that some\r\nof the eruptions of Hecla have lasted six years without cessation.\r\nEarthquakes have often shaken the whole island at once, causing great\r\nchanges in the interior, such as the sinking down of hills, the rending\r\nof mountains, the desertion by rivers of their channels, and the\r\nappearance of new lakes. New islands have often been thrown up near the\r\ncoast, while others have disappeared. In the intervals between the\r\neruptions, innumerable hot springs afford vent to the subterranean heat,\r\nand solfataras discharge copious streams of inflammable matter. The\r\nvolcanoes in different parts of the island are observed, like those of\r\nthe Phlegræan Fields, to be in activity by turns, one vent serving for a\r\ntime as a safety-valve for the others. The most memorable eruption of\r\nrecent years was that of Skaptár Jokul in 1783, when a new island was\r\nthrown up, and two torrents of lava issued forth, one 45 and the other\r\n50 miles in length, and which, according to the estimate of Professor\r\nBischoff, contained matter surpassing in magnitude the bulk of Mont\r\nBlanc. One of these streams filled up a large lake, and, entering the\r\nchannel of the Skaptâ, completely dried up the river. The volcanoes of\r\nIceland may be considered as safety-valves to the region in which lie\r\nthe British Isles.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _The Azores, Canary, and Cape de Verde Groups._--This group of\r\nvolcanic isles rises from deep Atlantic waters north of the Equator,\r\nand the vents of eruption are partially active, partially dormant, or\r\nextinct. It must be supposed, however, that at a former period volcanic\r\naction was vastly more energetic than at present; for, except at the\r\nGrand Canary, Gomera, Forta Ventura, and Lancerote, where various\r\nnon-volcanic rocks are found, these islands appear to have been built up\r\nfrom their foundations of eruptive materials. The highest point in the\r\nAzores is the Peak of Pico, which rises to a height of 7016 feet above\r\nthe ocean. But this great elevation is surpassed by that of the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe (or Pic de Teyde) in the Canaries, which attains to an\r\nelevation of 12,225 feet, as determined by Professor Piazzi Smyth.[2]\r\n\r\nThis great volcanic cone, rising from the ocean, its summit shrouded in\r\nsnow, and often protruding above the clouds, must be an object of\r\nuncommon beauty and interest when seen from the deck of a ship. (Fig.\r\n4.) The central cone, formed of trachyte, pumice, obsidian, and ashes,\r\nrises out of a vast caldron of older basaltic rocks with precipitous\r\ninner walls--much as the cone of Vesuvius rises from within the\r\npartially encircling walls of Somma. (Fig. 5.) From the summit issue\r\nforth sulphurous vapours, but no flame.\r\n\r\nPiazzi Smyth, who during a prolonged visit to this mountain in 1856 made\r\na careful survey of its form and structure, shows that the great cone is\r\nsurrounded by an outer ring of basalt enclosing two _foci_ of eruption,\r\nthe lavas from which have broken through the ring of the outer crater\r\non the western side, and have poured down the mountain. At the top of\r\nthe peak its once active crater is filled up, and we find a convex\r\nsurface (\"The Plain of Rambleta\") surmounted towards its eastern end by\r\na diminutive cone, 500 feet high, called \"Humboldt's Ash Cone.\" The\r\nslope of the great cone of Teneriffe ranges from 28° to 38°; and below a\r\nlevel of 7000 feet the general slope of the whole mountain down to the\r\nwater's edge varies from 10° to 12° from the horizontal. The great cone\r\nis penetrated by numerous basaltic dykes.\r\n\r\nThe Cape de Verde Islands, which contain beds of limestone along with\r\nvolcanic matter, possess in the island of Fuego an active volcano,\r\nrising to a height of 7000 feet above the surface of the ocean. The\r\ncentral cone, like that of Teneriffe, rises from within an outer crater,\r\nformed of basalt alternating with beds of agglomerate, and traversed by\r\nnumerous dykes of lava. This has been broken down on one side like that\r\nof Somma; and over its flanks are scattered numerous cones of scoriæ,\r\nthe most recent dating from the years 1785 and 1799.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--View of the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe\r\n(12,225 feet) and of the secondary crater, or outer ring of basaltic\r\nsheets which surrounds its base; seen from the east.--(After Leopold von\r\nBuch.)]\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of Lancerote have a remarkably linear arrangement from\r\nwest to east across the island. They are not yet extinct; for an\r\neruption in 1730 destroyed a large number of villages, and covered with\r\nlava the most fertile tracts in the island, which at the time of Leopold\r\nvon Buch's visit lay waste and destitute of herbage.[4] In the island of\r\nPalma there is one large central crater, the Caldera de Palma, three\r\nleagues in diameter, the walls of which conform closely to the margin\r\nof the coast. Von Buch calls this crater \"une merveille de la nature,\"\r\nfor it distinguishes this isle from all the others, and renders it one\r\nof the most interesting and remarkable amongst the volcanic islands of\r\nthe ocean. The outer walls are formed of basaltic sheets, and towards\r\nthe south this great natural theatre is connected with the ocean by a\r\nlong straight valley, called the \"Barranco de los Dolores,\" along whose\r\nsides the structure of the mountain is deeply laid open to view. The\r\nouter flanks of the crater are furrowed by a great number of smaller\r\nbarrancos radiating outward from the rim of the caldera. Von Buch\r\nregards the barrancos as having been formed during the upheaval of the\r\nisland, according to his theory of the formation of such mountains (the\r\nelevation-theory); but unfortunately for his views, these ravines widen\r\noutwards from the centre, or at least do not become narrower in that\r\ndirection, as would be the case were the elevation-theory sound. The\r\nmaps which accompany Von Buch's work are remarkably good, and were\r\npartly constructed by himself.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Volcanic Islands in the Atlantic south of the Equator._--The\r\nisland of Ascension, formed entirely of volcanic matter, rises from a\r\ndepth of 2000 fathoms in the very centre of the Atlantic. As described\r\nby Darwin, the central and more elevated portions are formed of\r\ntrachytic matter, with obsidian and laminated ash beds. Amongst these\r\nare found ejected masses of unchanged granite, fragments of which have\r\nbeen torn from the central pipe during periods of activity, and would\r\nseem to indicate a granitic floor, or at least an original floor upon\r\nwhich more recent deposits may have been superimposed. In St. Helena we\r\nseem, according to Daubeny, to have the mere wreck of one great crater,\r\nno one stream of lava being traceable to its source, while dykes of lava\r\nare scattered in profusion throughout the whole substance of the\r\nbasaltic masses which compose the island. Tristan da Cunha, in the\r\ncentre of the South Atlantic, rises abruptly from a depth of 12,150\r\nfeet, at a distance of 1500 miles from any land; and one of its summits\r\nreaches an elevation of 7000 feet, being a truncated cone composed of\r\nalternating strata of tuff and augitic lava, surrounding a crater in\r\nwhich is a lake of pure water. The volcano is extinct or dormant.\r\n\r\nWere the waters of the ocean to be drawn off, these volcanic islands\r\nwould appear like stupendous conical mountains, far loftier, and with\r\nsides more precipitous, than any to be found on our continental lands,\r\nall of which rise from platforms of considerable elevation. The enormous\r\npressure of the water on their sides enables these mid-oceanic islands\r\nto stand with slopes varying from the perpendicular to a smaller extent\r\nthan if they were sub-aerial; and it is on this account that we find them\r\nrising with such extraordinary abruptness from the \"vasty deep.\"\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Volcanic Islands of the Pacific._--The volcanic islands of this\r\ngreat ocean are scattered over a wide tract on both sides of the\r\nequator. Those to the north of this line include the Sandwich Islands,\r\nthe Mariana or Ladrone Islands, South Island, and Bonin Sima; south of\r\nthe equator, the Galapagos, New Britain, Salomon, Santa Cruz, New\r\nHebrides, the Friendly and Society Isles. While the coral reefs and\r\nislands of the Pacific may be recognised by their slight elevation\r\nabove the surface of the waters, those of volcanic origin and containing\r\nactive or extinct craters of eruption generally rise into lofty\r\nelevations, so that the two kinds are called the _Low_ Islands and\r\n_High_ Islands respectively. Amongst the group are trachytic domes such\r\nas the Mountain of Tobreonu in the Society Islands, rising to a height\r\nprobably not inferior to that of Etna, with extremely steep sides, and\r\nholding a lake on its summit.[5] The linear arrangement of some of the\r\nvolcanic islands of the Pacific is illustrated by those of the Tonga, or\r\nFriendly, Group, lying to the north of New Zealand. They consist of\r\nthree divisions--(1) the volcanic; (2) those formed of stratified\r\nvolcanic tuff, sometimes entirely or partially covered by coralline\r\nlimestone; and (3) those which are purely coralline. The first form a\r\nchain of lofty cones and craters, lying in a E.N.E. and W.S.W.\r\ndirection, and rising from depths of over 1000 fathoms. Mr. J. J.\r\nLister, who has described the physical characters of these islands, has\r\nshown very clearly that they lie along a line--probably that of a great\r\nfissure--stretching from the volcanic island of Amargura on the north\r\n(lat. 18° S.), through Lette, Metis, Kao (3030 feet), Tofua, Falcon,\r\nHonga Tonga, and the Kermadec Group into the New Zealand chain on the\r\nsouth. Some of these volcanoes are in a state of intermittent activity,\r\nas in the case of Tofua (lat. 20° 30' S.), Metis Island, and Amargura;\r\nthe others are dormant or extinct. The whole group appears to have been\r\nelevated at a recent period, as some of the beds of coral have been\r\nraised 1272 feet and upward above the sea-level, as in the case of Eua\r\nIsland.[6] The greater number of the Pacific volcanoes appear to be\r\nbasaltic; such as those of the Hawaiian Group, which have been so fully\r\ndescribed by Professor J. D. Dana.[7] Here fifteen volcanoes of the\r\nfirst class have been in brilliant action; all of which, except three,\r\nare now extinct, and these are in Hawaii the largest and most eastern of\r\nthe group. This island contains five volcanic mountains, of which Kea,\r\n13,805 feet, is the highest; next to that, Loa, 13,675 feet; after\r\nthese, Hualalai, rising 8273 feet; Kilauea, 4158 feet; and Kohala, 5505\r\nfeet above the sea; this last is largely buried beneath the lavas of\r\nMauna Kea. The group contains a double line of volcanoes, one lying to\r\nthe north and west of the other; and as the highest of the Hawaiian\r\nGroup rises from a depth in the ocean of over 2000 fathoms, the total\r\nelevation of this mountain from its base on the bed of the ocean is not\r\nfar from 26,000 feet, an elevation about that of the Himalayas. Mauna\r\nKea has long been extinct, Hualalai has been dormant since 1801; but\r\nMauna Loa is terribly active, there having been several eruptions,\r\naccompanied by earthquakes, within recent years, the most memorable\r\nbeing those of 1852 and 1868. In the former case the lava rose from the\r\ndeep crater into \"a lofty mountain,\" as described by Mr. Coan,[8] and\r\nthen flowed away eastward for a distance of twenty miles. The interior\r\nof the crater consists of a vast caldron, surrounded by a precipice 200\r\nto 400 feet in depth, with a circumference of about fifteen miles, and\r\ncontaining within it a second crater, bounded by a black ledge with a\r\nsteep wall of basalt--a crater within a crater; and from the floor of\r\nthe inner crater, formed of molten basalt, in a seething and boiling\r\nstate, arise a large number of small cones and pyramids of lava, some\r\nemitting columns of grey smoke, others brilliant flames and streams of\r\nmolten lava, presenting a wonderful spectacle, the effect of which is\r\nheightened by the constant roaring of the vast furnaces below.[9]\r\n\r\n[1] _Principles of Geology_, 11th edition, vol. ii. p. 48.\r\n\r\n[2] Smyth, _Report on the Teneriffe Astronomical Experiment of 1856_.\r\nHumboldt makes the elevation 12,090 feet.

The whole group rises from the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and consists of Vesuvius, Etna, Stromboli, one of the\r\nLipari Islands, and Vulcano, a mountain which has given the name to all\r\nmountains of similar origin with itself.[1] Along with these are\r\ninnumerable cones and craters of extinct or dormant volcanoes, of which\r\na large number have been thrown out on the flanks of Etna.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Prehistoric Ideas regarding the Nature of this Mountain._--Down\r\nto the commencement of the Christian era this mountain had given no\r\nostensible indication that it contained within itself a powerful focus\r\nof volcanic energy. True, that some vague tradition that the mountain\r\nonce gave forth fire hovered around its borders; and several ancient\r\nwriters, amongst them Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, inferred from the\r\nappearances of the higher parts of the mountain and the character of the\r\nrocks, which were \"cindery and as if eaten by fire,\" that the country\r\nwas once in a burning state, \"being full of fiery abysses, though now\r\nextinct from want of fuel.\" Seneca (B.C. 1 to A.D. 64) had detected the\r\ntrue character of Vesuvius, as \"having been a channel for the internal\r\nfire, but not its food;\" nevertheless, at this period the flanks of the\r\nmountain were covered by fields and vineyards, while the summit,\r\npartially enclosed with precipitous walls of the long extinct volcano,\r\nSomma, was formed of slaggy and scoriaceous material, with probably a\r\ncovering of scrub. Here it was that the gladiator Spartacus (B.C. 72),\r\nstung by the intolerable evils of the Roman Government, retreated to the\r\nvery summit of the mountain with some trusty followers. Clodius the\r\nPrætor, according to the narration of Plutarch, with a party of three\r\nthousand men, was sent against them, and besieged them in a mountain\r\n(meaning Vesuvius or Somma) having but one narrow and difficult passage,\r\nwhich Clodius kept guarded; all the rest was encompassed with broken and\r\nslippery precipices, but upon the top grew a great many wild vines; the\r\nbesieged cut down as many as they had need of, and twisted them into\r\nladders long enough to reach from thence to the bottom, by which,\r\nwithout any danger, all got down except one, who stayed behind to throw\r\nthem their arms, after which he saved himself with the rest.[2] \"On the\r\ntop\" must (as Professor Phillips observes) be interpreted the summit of\r\nthe exterior slope or crater edge, which would appear from the narrative\r\nto have broken down on one side, affording an entrance and mode of\r\negress by which Spartacus fell upon, and surprised, the negligent\r\nClodius Glabrus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Probable aspect of Vesuvius as it appeared at\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era; seen from the Bay of Naples.]\r\n\r\nIn fancied security, villas, temples, and cities had been erected on\r\nthe slopes of the mountain. Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ, the abodes\r\nof art, luxury, and vice, had sprung up in happy ignorance that they\r\n\"stood on a volcano,\" and that their prosperity was to have a sudden and\r\ndisastrous close.[3]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Premonitory Earthquake Shocks._--The first monitions of the\r\nimpending catastrophe occurred in the 63rd year after Christ, when the\r\nwhole Campagna was shaken by an earthquake, which did much damage to the\r\ntowns and villas surrounding the mountain even beyond Naples. This was\r\nfollowed by other shocks; and in Pompeii the temple of Isis was so much\r\ndamaged as to require reconstruction, which was undertaken and carried\r\nout by a citizen at his own expense.[4] These earthquake shakings\r\ncontinued for sixteen years. At length, on the night of August 24th,\r\nA.D. 79, they became so violent that the whole region seemed to reel and\r\ntotter, and all things appeared to be threatened with destruction. The\r\nnext day, about one in the afternoon, there was seen to rise in the\r\ndirection of Vesuvius a dense cloud, which, after ascending from the\r\nsummit of the mountain into the air for a certain height in one narrow,\r\nvertical trunk, spread itself out laterally in such a form that the\r\nupper part might be compared to the cluster of branches, and the lower\r\nto the stem of the pine which forms so common a feature in the Italian\r\nlandscape.[5]\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Pliny's Letters to Tacitus._--For an account of what followed we\r\nare indebted to the admirable letters of the younger Pliny, addressed to\r\nthe historian Tacitus, recounting the events which caused, or\r\naccompanied, the death of his uncle, the elder Pliny, who at the time of\r\nthis first eruption of Vesuvius was in command of the Roman fleet at the\r\nentrance to the Bay of Naples. These letters, which are models of style\r\nand of accurate description, are too long to be inserted here; but he\r\nrecounts how the dense cloud which hung over the mountain spread over\r\nthe whole surrounding region, sometimes illuminated by flashes of light\r\nmore vivid than lightning; how showers of cinders, stones, and ashes\r\nfell in such quantity that his uncle had to flee from Stabiæ, and that\r\neven at so great a distance as Misenum they encumbered the surface of\r\nthe ground; how the ground heaved and the bed of the sea was upraised;\r\nhow the cloud descended on Misenum, and even the island of Capreæ was\r\nconcealed from view; and finally, how, urged by a friend who had\r\narrived from Spain, he, with filial affection, supported the steps of\r\nhis mother in flying from the city of destruction. Such being the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere and the effects of the eruption at a point\r\nso distant as Cape Misenum, some sixteen geographical miles from the\r\nfocus of eruption, it is only to be expected that places not half the\r\ndistance, such as Herculaneum, Pompeii, and even Stabiæ, with many\r\nvillages and dwellings, should have shared a worse fate. The first of\r\nthese cities, situated on the coast of the Bay of Naples, appears to\r\nhave been overwhelmed by volcanic mud; Pompeii was buried in ashes and\r\nlapilli, and Stabiæ probably shared a similar fate.[6]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Appearance of the Mountain at the Commencement of the Christian\r\nEra._--At the time of the first recorded eruption Vesuvius appears to\r\nhave consisted of only a single cone with a crater, now known as Monte\r\ndi Somma, the central cone of eruption which now rises from within this\r\nouter ruptured casing not having been formed. (Fig. 6.) The first effect\r\nof the eruption of the year 79 was to blow out the solidified covering\r\nof slag and scoriæ forming the floor of the caldron. Doubtless at the\r\nclose of the eruption a cone of fragmental matter and lava of some\r\nslight elevation was built up, and, if so, was subsequently destroyed;\r\nfor, as we shall presently see by the testimony of the Abate Guilio\r\nCesare Braccini, who examined the mountain not long before the great\r\neruption of A.D. 1631, there was no central cone to the mountain at that\r\ntime; and the mountain had assumed pretty much the appearance it had at\r\nthe time that Spartacus took refuge within the walls of the great\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Destruction of Pompeii._--Pompeii was overwhelmed with dry ashes\r\nand lapilli. Sir W. Hamilton found some of the stones to weigh eight\r\npounds. At the time of the author's visit, early in April 1872, the\r\nexcavations had laid open a section about ten feet deep, chiefly\r\ncomposed of alternating layers of small pumice stones (lapilli) and\r\nvolcanic dust. It was during the sinking of a well in 1713 upon the\r\ntheatre containing the statues of Hercules and Cleopatra that the\r\nexistence of the ancient city was accidentally discovered.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _More recent eruptions._--Since the first recorded eruption in\r\nA.D. 79 down to the present day, Vesuvius has been the scene of numerous\r\nintermittent eruptions, of which some have been recorded; but many,\r\ndoubtless, are forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 203, during the reign of Severus, an eruption of extraordinary\r\nviolence took place, which is related by Dion Cassius, from whose\r\nnarrative we may gather that at this time there was only one large\r\ncrater, and that the central cone of Vesuvius had not as yet been\r\nupraised. In A.D. 472 an eruption occurred of such magnitude as to cover\r\nall Europe with fine dust, and spread alarm even at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Eruption of 1631._--In December 1631 occurred the great\r\nconvulsion whose memorials are written widely on the western face of\r\nVesuvius in ruined villages. This eruption left layers of ashes over\r\nhundreds of miles of country, or heaps of mud swept down by hot water\r\nfloods from the crater; the crater itself having been dissipated in the\r\nconvulsion. Braccini, who examined the mountain not long before this\r\neruption, found apparently no cone (or mount) like that of the modern\r\nVesuvius. He states that the crater was five miles in circumference,\r\nabout a thousand paces deep (or in sloping descent), and its sides\r\ncovered with forest trees and brushwood, while at the bottom there was a\r\nplain on which cattle grazed.[7] It would seem that the mountain had at\r\nthis time enjoyed a long interval of rest, and that it had reverted to\r\nvery much the same state in which it was at the period of the first\r\neruption, when the flanks were peopled by inhabitants living in fancied\r\nsecurity. But six months of violent earthquakes, which grew more violent\r\ntowards the close of 1631, heralded the eruption which took place in\r\nDecember, accompanied by terrific noises from within the interior of the\r\nmountain. The inhabitants of the coast were thus warned of the\r\napproaching danger, and had several days to arrange for their safety;\r\nbut in the end, a great part of Torre del Greco was destroyed, and a\r\nlike fate overtook Resina and Granatello, with a loss of life reported\r\nat 18,000 persons. During the eruption clouds condensed into tempests of\r\nrain, and hot water from the mountain, forming deluges of mud, swept\r\ndown the sides, and reached even to Nola and the Apennines. Nor was the\r\nsea unmoved. It retired during the violent earthquakes, and then\r\nreturned full thirty paces beyond its former limits.\r\n\r\nNot indeed until near the close of the seventeenth century is there any\r\nevidence that the central cone of Vesuvius was in existence; but in\r\nOctober 1685 an eruption occurred which is recorded by Sorrentino,\r\nduring which was erected \"a new mountain within, and higher than the old\r\none, and visible from Naples,\" a statement evidently referable to the\r\nexisting cone--so that it is little more than two centuries since this\r\nfamous volcanic mountain assumed its present form.\r\n\r\n(_h._) _Eruptions between the years 1500 and 1800._--Since A.D. 1500\r\nthere have been fifty-six recorded eruptions of Vesuvius; one of these\r\nin 1767 was of terrific violence and destructiveness, and is represented\r\nby Sir William Hamilton in views taken both before and during the\r\neruption. A pen-and-ink drawing of the appearance of the crater before\r\nthe eruption is here reproduced from Hamilton's picture, from which it\r\nwill be seen that the central crater contained within itself a second\r\ncrater-cone, from whence steam, lava, and stones were being erupted\r\n(Fig. 7). Thus it will be seen that Vesuvius at this epoch consisted of\r\nthree crater-cones within each other. The first, Monte di Somma; the\r\nsecond, the cone of Vesuvius; and the third, the little crater-cone\r\nwithin the second. During this eruption, vast lava-sheets invaded the\r\nfields and vineyards on the flanks of the mountain. A vivid account of\r\nthis eruption, as witnessed by Padre Torre, is given by Professor\r\nPhillips.[8] We shall pass over others without further reference until\r\nwe come down to our own times, in which Vesuvius has resumed its old\r\ncharacter, and in one grand exhibition of volcanic energy, which took\r\nplace in 1872, has evinced to the world that it still contains within\r\nits deep-seated laboratory all the elements of destructive force which\r\nit exhibited at the commencement of our era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--View of the crater of Vesuvius before the\r\neruption of 1767, showing an interior crater-cone rising from the centre\r\nof the exterior crater.--(After Sir W. Hamilton.)]\r\n\r\n(_i._) _Structure of the Neapolitan Campagna._--But before giving a\r\ndescription of this terrific outburst of volcanic energy, it may be\r\ndesirable to give some account of the physical position and structure of\r\nthis mountain, by which the phenomena of the eruption will be better\r\nunderstood. Vesuvius and the Neapolitan Campagna are formed of volcanic\r\nmaterials bounded on the west by the Gulf of Naples, and on the east and\r\nsouth by ranges of Jurassic limestone, a prolongation of the Apennines,\r\nwhich send out a spur bounding the bay on the south, and forming the\r\npromontory of Sorrento. The little island of Capri is also formed of\r\nlimestone, and is dissevered from the promontory by a narrow channel.\r\nThe northern side of the bay is, however, formed of volcanic materials;\r\nit includes the Phlegræan Fields (Campi Phlegræi), and terminates in the\r\npromontory of Miseno. Lying in the same direction are the islands of\r\nProcida and Ischia, also volcanic. Hence it will be seen that the two\r\nhorns of the bay are formed of entirely different materials, that of\r\nMiseno on the north being volcanic, that of Sorrento on the south being\r\ncomposed of Jurassic limestone, of an age vastly more ancient than the\r\nvolcanic rocks on the opposite shore. (Map, p. 52.)\r\n\r\nThe general composition of the Neapolitan Campagna, from which the\r\nmountain rises, has been revealed by means of the Artesian well sunk to\r\na depth of about 500 metres (1640 feet) at the Royal Palace of Naples,\r\nand may be generalised as follows:--\r\n\r\n                               { Recent beds of volcanic tuff\r\n(1)  From surface to depth of  {   with marine shells, and containing\r\n       715 feet                {   fragments of trachytic\r\n                               {   lava, etc. (_Volcanic Beds_).\r\n\r\n                               { Bituminous sands and marls\r\n(2)  From 715 to 1420          {   with marine shells of recent\r\n                               {   species(?)

Along the west and south this old\r\ncrater has been broken down; but near the centre there remains a\r\nround-backed ridge of similar materials, once doubtless a part of the\r\noriginal crater of Somma, rising above the slopes of lava on either\r\nhand. On this has been erected the Royal Observatory, under the\r\nsuperintendence of Professor Luigi Palmieri, where continuous\r\nobservations are being made, by means of delicate seismometers, of the\r\nearth-tremors which precede or accompany eruptions; for it is only\r\njustice to say that Vesuvius gives fair warning of impending mischief,\r\nand the instruments are quick to notify any premonitory symptoms of a\r\ncoming catastrophe. The elevation of the Observatory is 2080 feet above\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the Observatory ridge are wide channels filled to a\r\ncertain height with lavas of the nineteenth and preceding centuries, the\r\nmost recent presenting an aspect which can only be compared to a\r\nconfused multitude of black serpents and pachyderms writhing and\r\ninterlocked in some frightful death-struggle. Some of this lava, ten\r\nyears old, as we cross its rugged and black surface presents gaping\r\nfissures, showing the mass to be red-hot a few feet from the surface, so\r\nslow is the process of cooling. These lava-streams--some of them\r\nreaching to the sea-coast--have issued forth from the Atria at\r\nsuccessive periods of eruption.\r\n\r\nFrom the midst of the Atria rises the central cone, formed of cinders,\r\nscoriæ, and lava-streams, and fissured along lines radiating from the\r\naxis. This cone is very steep, the angle being about 40°-45° from the\r\nhorizontal, and is formed of loose cindery matter which gives way at\r\nevery step, and is rather difficult to climb. But on reaching the summit\r\nwe look down into the crater, displaying a scene of ever-varying\r\ncharacters, rather oval in form, and about 1100 yards in diameter. From\r\nthe map of Professor Guiscardi, published in 1855, there are seen two\r\nminor craters within the central one, formed in 1850, and an outflow of\r\nlava from the N.W. down the cone. At the time of the author's visit the\r\ncrater was giving indications, by the great quantity of sulphurous gas\r\nand vapour rising from its surface, and small jets of molten lava\r\nbeginning to flow down the outer side, of the grand outburst of internal\r\nforces which was presently to follow.\r\n\r\n(_k._) _Eruption of 1872._--The grand eruption of 1872, of which a\r\ndetailed account is given by Professor Palmieri,[10] commenced with a\r\nslight discharge of incandescent projectiles from the crater; and on the\r\n13th January an aperture appeared on the upper edge of the cone from\r\nwhich at first a little lava issued forth, followed by the uprising of a\r\ncone which threw out projectiles accompanied by smoke, whilst the\r\ncentral crater continued to detonate more loudly and frequently. This\r\nlittle cone ultimately increased in size, until in April it filled the\r\nwhole crater and rose four or five metres above the brim. At this time\r\nabundant lavas poured down from the base of the cone into the Atria del\r\nCavallo, thence turned into the Fossa della Vetraria in the direction of\r\nthe Observatory and towards the Crocella, where they accumulated to\r\nsuch an extent as to cover the hillside for a distance of about 300\r\nmetres; then turning below the Canteroni, formed a hillock without\r\nspreading much farther.\r\n\r\nIn October another small crater was formed by the falling in of the\r\nlava, which after a few days gave vent to smoke and several jets of\r\nlava; and towards the end of October the detonations increased, the\r\nsmoke from the central crater issued forth more densely mixed with\r\nashes, and the seismographical apparatus was much disturbed. On the 3rd\r\nand 4th November copious and splendid lava-streams coursed down the\r\nprincipal cone on its western side, but were soon exhausted; and in the\r\nbeginning of 1872 the little cone, regaining vigour, began to discharge\r\nlava from the summit instead of the base as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March 1873, with the full moon, the cone opened on the\r\nnorth-west side--the cleavage being indicated by a line of\r\nfumaroles--and lava issued from the base and poured down into the Atria\r\nas far as the precipices of Monte di Somma. On the 23rd April (another\r\nfull moon) the activity of the craters increased, and on the evening of\r\nthe 24th splendid lava-streams descended the cone in various directions,\r\nattracting on the same night the visits of a great many strangers. A\r\nlamentable event followed on the 26th. A party of visitors, accompanied\r\nby inexperienced guides, and contrary to the advice of Professor\r\nPalmieri, insisted on ascending to the place from which the lava issued.\r\nAt half-past three on the morning of the 26th they were in the Atria del\r\nCavallo, when the Vesuvian cone was rent in a north-west direction and a\r\ncopious torrent of lava issued forth. Two large craters formed at the\r\nsummit of the mountain, discharging incandescent projectiles and ashes.\r\nA cloud of smoke enveloped the unhappy visitors, who were under a\r\nhail-storm of burning projectiles. Eight were buried beneath it, or in\r\nthe lava, while eleven were grievously injured.[11] The lava-stream,\r\nflowing over that of 1871 in the Atria, divided into two branches, the\r\nsmaller one flowing towards Resina, but stopping before reaching the\r\ntown; the larger precipitated itself into the Fossa della Vetraria,\r\noccupying the whole width of 800 metres, and traversing the entire\r\nlength of 1300 metres in three hours. It dashed into the Fossa di\r\nFarone, and reached the villages of Massa and St. Sebastiano, covering a\r\nportion of the houses, and, continuing its course through an artificial\r\nfoss, or trench, invaded cultivated ground and several villages. If it\r\nhad not greatly slackened after midnight, from failure of supply at its\r\nsource, it would have reached Naples by Ponticelli and flowed into the\r\nsea. The eruption towards the end of April had reached its height. The\r\nObservatory ridge was bounded on either side by two fiery streams, which\r\nrendered the heat intolerable. Simultaneously with the opening of the\r\ngreat fissure two large craters opened at the summit, discharging with a\r\ndreadful noise an immense cloud of smoke and ashes, with bombs which\r\nrose to a height of 1300 metres above the brim of the volcano.[12] The\r\ntorrents of fire which threatened Resina, Bosco, and Torre Annunziata,\r\nand which devastated the fertile country of Novelle, Massa, St.\r\nSebastiano, and Cerole, and two partially buried cities, the continual\r\nthunderings and growling of the craters, caused such terror, that\r\nnumbers abandoned their dwellings, flying for refuge into Naples, while\r\nmany Neapolitans went to Rome or other places. Fortunately, the paroxysm\r\nhad now passed, the lava-streams stopped in their course, and the great\r\ntorrent which passed the shoulders of the Observatory through the Fossa\r\ndella Vetraria lowered the level of its surface below that of its sides,\r\nwhich appeared like two parallel ramparts above it. Had these streams\r\ncontinued to flow on the 27th of April as they had done on the previous\r\nnight, they would have reached the sea, bringing destruction to the very\r\nwalls of Naples. During this eruption Torre del Greco was upraised to\r\nthe extent of two metres, and nearly all the houses were knocked down.\r\n\r\nThe igneous period of eruption having terminated, the ashes, lapilli,\r\nand projectiles became more abundant, accompanied by thunder and\r\nlightning. On the 28th they darkened the air, and the terrific noise of\r\nthe mountain continuing or increasing, the terror at Resina, Portici,\r\nand Naples became universal. It seemed as though the tragic calamities\r\nof the eruption of A.D. 79 were about to be repeated. But gradually the\r\nforce of the explosions decreased, and the noise from the crater became\r\ndiscontinuous, so that on the 30th the detonations were very few, and by\r\nthe 1st May the eruption was completely over.\r\n\r\nSuch is a condensed account of one of the most formidable eruptions of\r\nour era. In the frontispiece of this volume a representation, taken (by\r\npermission) from a photograph by Negretti & Zambra, is given, showing\r\nthe appearance of Vesuvius during the final stage of the eruption, when\r\nprodigious masses of smoke, steam, and illuminated gas issued forth from\r\nthe summit and overspread the whole country around with a canopy which\r\nthe light of the sun could scarcely penetrate.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed in the above account that, concurrently with the full\r\nmoon, there were two distinct and special outbreaks of activity; one\r\noccurring in March, the other in the month following. That the\r\nconditions of lunar and solar attraction should have a marked effect on\r\na part of the earth's crust, while under the tension of eruptive forces,\r\nis only what might be expected. At full moon the earth is between the\r\nsun and the moon, and at new moon the moon is between the sun and the\r\nearth; under these conditions (the two bodies acting in concert) we have\r\nspring tides in the ocean, and a maximum of attraction on the mass of\r\nthe earth. Hence the crust, which at the time referred to was under\r\ntremendous strain, only required the addition of that caused by the\r\nlunar and solar attractions to produce rupture in both cases, giving\r\nrise to increased activity, and the extrusion of lava and volatile\r\nmatter. It may, in general, be safely affirmed that low barometric\r\npressure on the one hand, and the occurrence of the syzygies (when the\r\nattractions of the sun and moon are in the same line) on the other, have\r\nhad great influence in determining the crises of eruptions of volcanic\r\nmountains when in a state of unrest.\r\n\r\n_Contrast between the Northern and Southern Slopes._--Before leaving\r\nVesuvius it may be observed that throughout all the eruptions of modern\r\ntimes the northern side of the mountain, that is the old crater and\r\nflank of Somma, has been secure from the lava-flows, and has enjoyed an\r\nimmunity which does not belong to the southern and western side. If we\r\nlook at a map of the mountain showing the direction of the streams\r\nduring the last three centuries,[13] we observe that all the streams of\r\nthat period flowed down on the side overlooking the Bay of Naples; on\r\nthe opposite side the wall of Monte di Somma presents an unbroken front\r\nto the lava-streams. From this it may be inferred that one side, the\r\nwest, is weaker than the other; and consequently, when the lava and\r\nvapours are being forced upwards, under enormous pressure from beneath,\r\nthe western side gives way under the strain, as in the case of the\r\nfissure of 1872, and the lava and vapours find means of escape. From\r\nwhat has happened in the past it is clear that no place on the western\r\nside of the mountain is entirely safe from devastation by floods of\r\nlava; while the prevalent winds tend to carry the ashes and lapilli,\r\nwhich are hurled into the air, in the same westerly direction.\r\n\r\n[1] For an excellent view of this remarkable volcanic group see Judd's\r\n_Volcanoes_, 4th edition, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[2] Plutarch, _Life of Cassius_; _ed.

A fire that shifted and wavered in its hues with every\r\nmoment--now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red that again\r\nblazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!... Then there arose on\r\nhigh the shrieks of women; the men stared at each other, but were\r\nspeechless. At that moment they felt the earth shake beneath their feet;\r\nthe walls of the theatre trembled; and beyond, in the distance, they\r\nheard the crash of falling roofs; an instant more and the mountain-cloud\r\nseemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid; at the same time it cast\r\nforth from its bosom a shower of ashes mixed with vast fragments of\r\nburning stone. Over the crushing vines--over the desolate streets--over\r\nthe amphitheatre itself--far and wide, with many a mighty splash in the\r\nagitated sea, fell that awful shower.\" A visit to the disinterred city\r\nwill probably produce on the mind a still more lasting and vivid\r\nimpression of the swift destruction which overtook this city.\r\n\r\n[7] Quoted by Phillips, _loc. cit._, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[8] _Vesuvius_, p. 72 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[9] Johnston-Lavis, \"On the Geology of Monti Somma and Vesuvius,\"\r\n_Quart.

The structure and features of this\r\nmagnificent mountain have been abundantly illustrated by Elie de\r\nBeaumont,[1] Daubeny,[2] Baron von Waltershausen,[3] and Lyell,[4] of\r\nwhose writings I shall freely avail myself in the following account, not\r\nhaving had the advantage of a personal examination of this region.\r\n\r\n_Structure of Etna._--So large is Etna that it would enclose within its\r\nample skirts several cones of the size of Vesuvius. It rises to a height\r\nof nearly 11,000 feet above the waters of the Mediterranean,[5] and is\r\nplanted on a floor consisting of stratified marine volcanic matter, with\r\nclays, sands, and limestones of newer Pliocene age. Its base is nearly\r\ncircular, and has a circumference of 87 English miles. In ascending its\r\nflanks we pass successively over three well-defined physical zones: the\r\nlowest, or fertile zone, comprising the tract around the skirts of the\r\nmountain up to a level of about 2500 feet, being well cultivated and\r\ncovered by dwellings surrounded by olive groves, fields, vineyards, and\r\nfruit-trees; the second, or forest zone, extending to a level of about\r\n6270 feet, clothed with chestnut, oak, beech, and cork trees, giving\r\nplace to pines; and the third, extending to the summit and called \"the\r\ndesert region,\" a waste of black lava and scoriæ with mighty crags and\r\nprecipices, terminating in a snow-clad tableland, from which rises the\r\ncentral cone, 1100 feet high, emitting continually steam and sulphurous\r\nvapours, and in the course of almost every century sending forth streams\r\nof molten lava.\r\n\r\nThe forest zone is remarkable for the great number of minor craters\r\nwhich rise up from the midst of the foliage, and are themselves clothed\r\nwith trees. Sartorius von Waltershausen has laid down on his map of Etna\r\nabout 200 of these cones and craters, some of which, like those of\r\nAuvergne, have been broken down on one side. Many of these volcanoes of\r\nsecond or third magnitude lie outside the forest zone, both above and\r\nbelow it; such as the double hill of Monti Rossi, near Nicolosi, formed\r\nin 1659, which is 450 feet in height, and two miles in circumference at\r\nits base. Sir C. Lyell observes that these minor crater-cones present us\r\nwith one of the most delightful and characteristic scenes in Europe.\r\nThey occur of every variety of height and size, and are arranged in\r\npicturesque groups. However uniform they may appear when seen from the\r\nsea or the plains below, nothing can be more diversified than their\r\nshape when we look from above into their ruptured craters. The cones\r\nsituated in the higher parts of the forest zone are chiefly clothed with\r\nlofty pines; while those at a lower elevation are adorned with\r\nchestnuts, oaks, and beech trees. These cones have from time to time\r\nbeen buried amidst fresh lava-streams descending from the great crater,\r\nand thus often become obliterated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Ideal Section through Etna. (After Lyell.)--A.\r\nAxis of present cone of eruption; B.

Tertiary strata forming the foundation to the volcanic rocks.\r\nThe position of the Val del Bove before its formation is shown by the\r\nlightly-shaded portion above B.]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Val del Bove._--The most wonderful feature of Mount Etna is the\r\ncelebrated Val del Bove (Valle del Bue), of which S. von Waltershausen\r\nhas furnished a very beautiful plate[6]--a vast amphitheatre hewn out of\r\nthe eastern flank of the mountain, just below the snow-mantled platform.\r\nIt is a physical feature somewhat after the fashion of Monte Somma in\r\nVesuvius, but exceeds it in magnitude as Etna exceeds Vesuvius. The Val\r\ndel Bove is about five miles in diameter, bounded throughout\r\nthree-fourths of its circumference by precipitous walls of ashes,\r\nscoriæ, and lava, traversed by innumerable dykes, and rising inwards to\r\na height of between 3000 and 4000 feet. Towards the east the cliffs\r\ngradually fall to a height of about 500 feet, and at this side the vast\r\nchasm opens out upon the slope of the mountain. At the head of the Val\r\ndel Bove rises the platform, surmounted by the great cone and crater. It\r\nwill thus be seen that by means of this hollow we have access almost to\r\nthe very heart of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWhat is very remarkable about the structure of this valley is that the\r\nbeds exhibit \"the _quâ-quâ_ versal dip\"--in other words, they dip away\r\non all sides from the centre--which has led to the conclusion that in\r\nthe centre is a focus of eruption which had become closed up\r\nantecedently to the formation of the valley itself. Lyell has explained\r\nthis point very clearly by showing that this focus had ceased to eject\r\nmatter at some distant period, and that the existing crater at the\r\nsummit of the mountain had poured out its lavas over those of the\r\nextinct orifice. This was prior to the formation of the Val del Bove\r\nitself; and the question remains for consideration how this vast natural\r\namphitheatre came to be hollowed out; for its structure shows\r\nunquestionably that it owes its form to some process of excavation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is certainly not the work of running water, as in\r\nthe case of the cañons of Colorado; the porous matter of which the\r\nmountain is formed is quite incapable of originating and supporting a\r\nstream of sufficient volume to excavate and carry away such enormous\r\nmasses of matter within the period required for the purpose. We must\r\ntherefore have recourse to some other agency. Numerous illustrations are\r\nto be found of the explosive action of volcanoes in blowing off either\r\nthe summits of mountains, or portions of their sides. For example, there\r\nis reason for believing that the first result of the renewed energy of\r\nVesuvius was to blow into the air the upper surface of the mountain.\r\nAgain, so late as 1822, during a violent earthquake in Java, a country\r\nwhich has been repeatedly devastated by earthquakes and volcanic\r\neruptions, the mountain of Galongoon, which was covered by a dense\r\nforest, and situated in a fertile and thickly-peopled region, and had\r\nnever within the period of tradition been in activity, was thus ruptured\r\nby internal forces. In the month of July 1822, after a terrible\r\nearthquake, an explosion was heard, and immense columns of boiling\r\nwater, mixed with mud and stones, were projected from the mountain like\r\na water-spout, and in falling filled up the valleys, and covered the\r\ncountry with a thick deposit for many miles, burying villages and their\r\ninhabitants. During a subsequent eruption great blocks of basalt were\r\nthrown to a distance of seven miles; the result of all being that an\r\nenormous semicircular gulf was formed between the summit and the plain,\r\nbounded by steep cliffs, and bearing considerable resemblance to the Val\r\ndel Bove. Other examples of the power of volcanic explosions might be\r\ncited; but the above are sufficient to show that great hollows may thus\r\nbe formed either on the summits or flanks of volcanic mountains. Chasms\r\nmay also be formed by the falling in of the solidified crust, owing to\r\nthe extrusion of molten matter from some neighbouring vent of eruption;\r\nand it is conceivable that by one or other of these processes the vast\r\nchasm of the Val del Bove on the flanks of Etna may have been produced.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _The Physical History of Etna._--The physical history of Etna\r\nseems to be somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n_First Stage._--Somewhere towards the close of the Tertiary\r\nperiod--perhaps early Pliocene or late Miocene--a vent of eruption\r\nopened on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, from which sheets of lava\r\nwere poured forth, and ashes mingled with clays and sands, brought down\r\nfrom the neighbouring lands, were strewn over the sea-bed. During a\r\npause in volcanic activity, beds of limestone with marine shells were\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\n_Second Stage._--This sea-bed was gradually upraised into the air, while\r\nfresh sheets of lava and other _ejecta_ were accumulated round the vents\r\nof eruption, of which there were two principal ones--the older under the\r\npresent Val del Bove, the newer under the summit of the principal cone.\r\nThus was the mountain gradually piled up.\r\n\r\n_Third Stage._--The vent under the Val del Bove ceased to extrude more\r\nmatter, and became extinct. Meanwhile the second vent continued active,\r\nand, piling up more and more matter round the central crater, surmounted\r\nthe former vent, and covered its _ejecta_ with newer sheets of lava,\r\nashes, and lapilli, while numerous smaller vents, scattered all over the\r\nsides of the mountain, gave rise to smaller cones and craters.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Stage._--This stage is signalised by the formation of the Val\r\ndel Bove through some grand explosion, or series of explosions, by which\r\nthis vast chasm was opened in the side of the mountain, as already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Stage._--This represents the present condition of the mountain,\r\nwhose height above the sea is due, not only to accumulation of volcanic\r\nmaterials round the central cone, but to elevation of the whole island,\r\nas evinced by numerous raised beaches of gravel and sand, containing\r\nshells and other forms of marine species now living in the waters of the\r\nMediterranean.[7] Since then the condition and form of the mountain has\r\nremained very much the same, varied only by the results of occasional\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Dissimilarity in the Constitution of the Lavas of Etna and\r\nVesuvius._--Before leaving the subject we have been considering, it is\r\nnecessary that I should mention one remarkable fact connected with the\r\norigin of the lavas of Etna and Vesuvius respectively; I refer to their\r\nessential differences in mineral composition. It might at first sight\r\nhave been supposed that the lavas of these two volcanic\r\nmountains--situated at such a short distance from each other, and\r\nevidently along the same line of fracture in the crust--would be of the\r\nsame general composition; but such is not the case. In the lava of\r\nVesuvius leucite is an essential, and perhaps the most abundant mineral.\r\nIt is called by Zirkel _Sanidin-Leucitgestein_. (See Plate IV.) But in\r\nthat of Etna this mineral is (as far as I am aware) altogether absent.\r\nWe have fortunately abundant means of comparison, as the lavas of these\r\ntwo mountains have been submitted to close examination by petrologists.\r\nIn the case of the Vesuvian lavas, an elaborate series of chemical\r\nanalyses and microscopical observations have been made by the Rev.\r\nProfessor Haughton, of Dublin University, and the author,[8] from\r\nspecimens collected by Professor Guiscardi from the lava-flows extending\r\nfrom 1631 to 1868, in every one of which leucite occurs, generally as\r\nthe most abundant mineral, always as an essential constituent. On the\r\nother hand, the composition of the lavas of Etna, determined by\r\nProfessor A. von Lasaulx, from specimens taken from the oldest\r\n(vorätnäischen) sheets of lava down to those of the present day,\r\nindicates a rock of remarkable uniformity of composition, in which the\r\ncomponents are plagioclase felspar, augite, olivine, magnetite, and\r\nsometimes apatite; but of leucite we have no trace.[9] In fact, the\r\nlavas of Etna are very much the same in composition as the ordinary\r\nbasalts of the British Isles, while those of Vesuvius are of a different\r\ntype. This seems to suggest an origin of the two sets of lavas from a\r\ndifferent deep-seated magma; the presence of leucite in such large\r\nquantity requiring a magma in which soda is in excess, as compared with\r\nthat from which the lavas of Etna have been derived.[10]\r\n\r\n[1] _Mémoires pour Servir_, etc., vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[2] Daubeny, _Volcanoes_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n[3] Von Waltershausen, _Der Ætna_, edited by A. von Lasaulx.\r\n\r\n[4] Lyell, _Principles of Geology_, vol. ii., edition 1872.\r\n\r\n[5] Its height, as determined by Captain Smyth in 1875\r\ntrigonometrically, was 10,874 feet, and afterwards by Sir J. Herschel\r\nbarometrically, 10,872 feet.\r\n\r\n[6] _Atlas des Ætna_ (Weimar, 1858), in which the different lava-streams\r\nof 1688, 1802, 1809, 1811, 1819, 1824, and 1838 are delineated.\r\n\r\n[7] Sir William Hamilton observes that history is silent regarding the\r\nfirst eruptions of Etna. It was in activity before the Trojan War, and\r\neven before the arrival of the \"Sizilien\" settlers. Diodorus and\r\nThucydides notice the earliest recorded eruptions, those from 772 to 388\r\nB.C., during which time the mountain was thrice in eruption. Later\r\neruptions took place in the year 140, 135, 125, 122 B.C. In the year 44\r\nB.C., in the reign of Julius Cæsar, there was a very violent outburst of\r\nvolcanic activity.--_Neuere Beobachtungen über die Vulkane Italiens und\r\nam Rhein_, p. 173, Frankfurt (1784).\r\n\r\n[8] \"Report on the Chemical and Mineralogical Characters of the Lavas of\r\nVesuvius from 1631 to 1868,\" _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_,\r\nvol. xxvi. (1876). In the lava of 1848 leucite was found to reach 44.9\r\nper cent. of the whole mass. In that of Granatello, 1631, it reaches its\r\nlowest proportion--viz., 3.37 per cent.\r\n\r\n[9] A. von Lasaulx, in Von Waltershausen's _Der Ætna_, Book II., x. 423.\r\n\r\n[10] The view of Professor Judd, that leucite easily changes into\r\nfelspar, and that some ancient igneous rocks which now contain felspar\r\nwere originally leucitic, does not seem to be borne out by the above\r\nfacts. In such cases the felspar crystals ought to retain the forms of\r\nleucite. See _Volcanoes_, 4th edition, p. 268.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE LIPARI ISLANDS, STROMBOLI.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a._) A brief account of this remarkable group of volcanic islands must\r\nhere be given, inasmuch as they seem to be representatives of a stage of\r\nvolcanic action in which the igneous forces are gradually losing their\r\nenergy. According to Daubeny, the volcanic action in these islands seems\r\nto be developed along two lines, nearly at right angles to each other,\r\none parallel to that of the Apennines, beginning with Stromboli,\r\nintersecting Panaria, Lipari, and Vulcano; the other extending from\r\nPanaria to Salina, Alicudi, and Felicudi, and again visible in the\r\nvolcanic products which make their appearance at Ustica. (See Map, Fig.\r\n11.) The islands lie between the north coast of Sicily and that of\r\nItaly, and from their position seem to connect Etna with Vesuvius; but\r\nthis is very problematical, as would appear from the difference of their\r\nlavas. The principal islands are those of Stromboli, Panaria, Lipari,\r\nVulcano, Salina, Felicudi, and Alicudi. These three last are extinct or\r\ndormant, but Salina contains a crater, rising, according to Daubeny, not\r\nless than 3500 feet above the sea.[1] Vulcano (referred to by Strabo\r\nunder the name of Hiera) consists of a crater which constantly emits\r\nlarge quantities of sulphurous vapours, but was in a state of activity\r\nin the year 1786, when, after frequent earthquake shocks and\r\nsubterranean noises, it vomited forth during fifteen days showers of\r\nsand, together with clouds of smoke and flame, altering materially the\r\nshape of the crater from which they proceeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIPARI ISLANDS.\r\nFig. 11.--Map to show the position of these islands, showing the\r\nbranching lines of volcanic action--one parallel to that of the\r\nApennines, the other stretching westwards at right angles thereto.]\r\n\r\nThe islands of Lipari are formed of beds of tuff, penetrated by numerous\r\ndykes of lava, from which uprise two or three craters, formed of pumice\r\nand obsidian passing into trachyte. Volcanic operations might have here\r\nbeen said to be extinct, were it not that their continuance is\r\nmanifested by the existence of hot springs and \"stufes,\" or vapour\r\nbaths, at St. Calogero, about four miles from the town of Lipari.\r\nDaubeny considers it not improbable that this island may have had an\r\nactive volcano even within the historical period, a view which is borne\r\nout by the statement of Strabo.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Island of Vulcano, one of the Lipari Group, in\r\neruption.--(After Sir W. Hamilton.)]\r\n\r\n(_b._) But by far the most remarkable island of the group, as regards\r\nits present volcanic condition, is Stromboli, which has ever been in\r\nactive eruption from the commencement of history down to the present\r\nday. Professor Judd, who visited this island in 1874, and has produced a\r\nstriking representation of its aspect,[3] gives an account of which I\r\nshall here avail myself.[4] The island is of rudely circular outline,\r\nand rises into a cone, the summit of which is 3090 feet above the level\r\nof the Mediterranean. From a point on the side of the mountain masses of\r\nvapour are seen to issue, and these unite to form a cloud over the\r\nsummit; the outline of this vapour-cloud varying continually according\r\nto the hygrometric state of the atmosphere, and the direction and force\r\nof the wind. At the time of Professor Judd's visit, the vapour-cloud\r\nwas spread in a great horizontal stratum overshadowing the whole island;\r\nbut it was clearly seen to be made up of a number of globular masses,\r\neach of which is a product of a distinct outburst of volcanic forces.\r\nViewed at night-time, Stromboli presents a far more striking and\r\nsingular spectacle. When watched from the deck of a vessel, a glow of\r\nred light is seen to make its appearance from time to time above the\r\nsummit of the mountain; it may be observed to increase gradually in\r\nintensity, and then as gradually to die away. After a short interval the\r\nsame appearances are repeated, and this goes on till the increasing\r\nlight of dawn causes the phenomenon to be no longer visible. The\r\nresemblance presented by Stromboli to a \"flashing light\" on a most\r\ngigantic scale is very striking, and the mountain has long been known as\r\n\"the lighthouse of the Mediterranean.\"\r\n\r\nThe mountain is built up of ashes, slag, and scoriæ, to a height of (as\r\nalready stated) over 3000 feet above the surface of the sea; but, as\r\nProfessor Judd observes, this by no means gives a just idea of its vast\r\nbulk. Soundings in the sea surrounding the island show that the bottom\r\ngradually shelves around the shores to a depth of nearly 600 fathoms, so\r\nthat Stromboli is a great conical mass of cinders and slaggy materials,\r\nhaving a height above its floor of about 6600 feet, and a base the\r\ndiameter of which exceeds four miles.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Stromboli is situated, not at the apex of the cone, but at\r\na distance of 1000 feet below it. The explosions of steam, accompanied\r\nby the roaring as of a smelting furnace, or of a railway engine when\r\nblowing off its steam, are said by Judd to take place at very irregular\r\nintervals of time, \"varying from less than one minute to twenty minutes,\r\nor even more.\" On the other hand, Hoffmann describes them as occurring\r\nat \"perfectly regular intervals,\" so that, perhaps, some variation has\r\ntaken place within the interval of about forty years between each\r\nobservation. Both observers agree in stating that lava is to be seen\r\nwelling up from some of the apertures within the crater, and pouring\r\ndown the slope towards the sea, which it seldom or never reaches.[5] The\r\nintermittent character of these eruptions appears to be due, as Mr.\r\nScrope has suggested, to the exact proportion between the expansive and\r\nrepressive forces; the expansive force arising from the generation of a\r\ncertain amount of aqueous vapour and of elastic gas; the repressive,\r\nfrom the pressure of the atmosphere and from the weight of the\r\nsuperincumbent volcanic products. Steam is here, as in a steam-engine,\r\nnot the originating agent in the phenomena recorded; but the result of\r\nwater coming in contact with molten lava constantly welling up from the\r\ninterior, by which it is converted into steam, which from time to time\r\nacquires sufficient elastic force to produce the eruptions; the water\r\nbeing obviously derived from the surrounding sea, which finds its way by\r\nfiltration through fissures, or through the porous mass of which the\r\nmountain is formed. Were it not for the access of water this volcano\r\nwould probably appear as a fissure-cone extruding a small and continuous\r\nstream of molten lava. The adventitious access of the sea water gives\r\nrise to the phenomena of intermittent explosions. The vitality of the\r\nvolcano is therefore due, not to the presence of water, but to the\r\nwelling up of matter from the internal reservoir through the throat of\r\nthe volcano.\r\n\r\n_Pantelleria._--This island, lying between the coast of Sicily and Cape\r\nBon in Africa, is wholly volcanic. It has a circumference of thirty\r\nmiles, and from its centre rises an extinct crater-cone to a height of\r\nabout 3000 feet. The flanks of this volcano are diversified by several\r\nfresh craters and lava-streams, while hot springs burst out with a\r\nhissing noise on its southern flank, showing that molten matter lies\r\nbelow at no very great depth.\r\n\r\nThis island probably lies along the dividing line between the\r\nnon-volcanic and volcanic region of the Mediterranean, and is\r\nconsequently liable to intermittent eruptions. It was at a short\r\ndistance from this island that the remarkable submarine outburst of\r\nvolcanic forces took place on October 17th, 1891, for an account of\r\nwhich we are indebted to Colonel J. C. Mackowen.[6] On that day, after a\r\nsuccession of earthquake shocks, the inhabitants were startled by\r\nobserving a column of \"smoke\" rising out of the sea at a distance of\r\nthree miles, in a north-westerly direction. The Governor, Francesco\r\nValenza, having manned a boat, rowed out towards the fiery column, and\r\non arriving found it to consist of black scoriaceous bombs, which were\r\nbeing hurled into the air to a height of nearly thirty yards; some of\r\nthem burst in the air, others, discharging steam, ran hissing over the\r\nwater; many of them were very hot, some even red-hot. One of these\r\nbombs, measuring two feet in diameter, was captured and brought to\r\nshore. It was observed that after the eruption the earthquake shocks\r\nceased. A vast amount of material was cast out of the submarine crater,\r\nforming an island 500 yards in length and rising up to nine feet above\r\nthe surface, but after a few days it was broken up and dispersed over\r\nthe sea-bed by the action of the waves.\r\n\r\n[1] _Volcanoes_, p. 262. These islands are described by Hoffmann,\r\n_Poggendorf Annal._, vol. xxvi.

This island for 2000 years has\r\nbeen the scene of active volcanic operations, and in its outline and\r\nconfiguration, both below and above the surface of the Mediterranean,\r\npresents the aspect of a partially submerged volcanic mountain. (See\r\nSection, Fig. 13.) If, for example, we can imagine the waters of the sea\r\nto rise around the flanks of Vesuvius until they have entered and\r\noverflowed to some depth the interior caldron of Somma, thus converting\r\nthe old crater into a crescent-shaped island, and the cone of Vesuvius\r\ninto an island--or group of islands--within the caldron, then we shall\r\nform some idea of the appearance and structure of the Santorin group.\r\n\r\n_Form of the Group._--The principal island, Thera, has somewhat the\r\nshape of a crescent, breaking off in a precipitous cliff on the inner\r\nside, but on the outer side sloping at an angle of about fifteen degrees\r\ninto deep water. Continuing the curvature of the crescent, but separated\r\nby a channel, is the island of Therasia; and between this and the\r\nsouthern promontory of Thera is another island called Aspronisi. All\r\nthese islands, if united, would form the rim of a crater, in which the\r\nvolcanic matter slopes outward into deep water, descending at a short\r\ndistance to a depth of 200 fathoms and upwards. In the centre of the\r\ngulf thus formed rise three islands, called the Old, New, and Little\r\nKaimenis. These may be regarded as cones of eruption, which history\r\nrecords as having been thrown up at successive intervals. According to\r\nPliny, the year 186 B.C. gave birth to Old Kaimeni, also called Hiera,\r\nor the Sacred Isle; and in the first year of our era Thera (the Divine)\r\nmade its appearance above the water, and was soon joined to the older\r\nisland by subsequent eruptions. Old Kaimeni also increased in size by\r\nthe eruptions of 726 and 1427. A century and a half later, in 1573,\r\nanother eruption produced the cone and crater called Micra-Kaimeni. Thus\r\nwere formed, or rather were rendered visible above the water, the\r\ncentral craters of eruption; and between these and the inner cliff of\r\nThera and Therasia is a ring of deep water, descending to a depth of\r\nover 200 fathoms. So that, were these islands raised out of the sea, we\r\nshould have presented to our view a magnificent circular crater about\r\nsix miles in diameter, bounded by nearly vertical walls of rock from\r\n1000 to 1500 feet in height, and ruptured at one point, from the centre\r\nof which would rise two volcanic cones--namely, the Kaimenis--one with a\r\ndouble crater, still foci of eruption, and from time to time bursting\r\nforth in paroxysms of volcanic energy, of which those of 1650, 1707, and\r\n1866 were the most violent and destructive.[1] Of this last I give a\r\nbird's-eye view (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nThe only rock of non-volcanic origin in these islands consists of\r\ngranular limestone and clay slate forming the ridge of Mount St. Elias,\r\nwhich rises to a height of 1887 feet at the south-eastern side of the\r\nisland of Thera, crossing the island from its outer margin nearly to the\r\ninterior cliff, so that the volcanic materials have been piled up along\r\nits sides. The rocks of St. Elias are much more ancient than any of the\r\nvolcanic materials around; and, as Bory St. Vincent has shown, have been\r\nsubjected to the same flexures, dip and strike, as those sedimentary\r\nrocks which go to form the non-volcanic islands of the Grecian\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Bird's-eye View of the Gulf of Santorin during\r\nthe volcanic eruption of February 1866.--(After Lyell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ground Plan of Rocca Monfina_\r\nFig. 15.--Rocca Monfina, in Southern Italy, showing a crater-ring of\r\ntrachytic tuffs, from the midst of which, according to Judd, an andesite\r\nlava-cone has been built up. Compare with the Santorin Group.]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Origin of the Santorin Group._--In reference to the origin of\r\nthe Santorin group, Lyell regards it as a remnant of a great volcanic\r\nmountain which possessed a focus of eruption rising in the position of\r\nthe present foci, but afterwards partially destroyed and the whole\r\nsubmerged to a depth of over 1000 feet. But another explanation is open\r\nto us, and one not inconsistent with what we now know of the physical\r\nchanges to which the Mediterranean has been subjected since early\r\nTertiary times. To my mind it is difficult to conceive how such a\r\nvolcanic mountain as that of Santorin could have been formed under\r\nwater; while, on the other hand, its physical structure and contour bear\r\nso striking a resemblance (as already observed) to those of Vesuvius and\r\nRocca Monfina that we are much tempted to infer that it had a somewhat\r\nsimilar origin. Now we know that Vesuvius was built up by means of\r\nsuccessive eruptions taking place under the air; and the question arises\r\nwhether it could be possible that Santorin had a similar origin owing to\r\nthe waters of the Mediterranean having been temporally lowered at a\r\nlater Tertiary epoch. It has been stated by M. Fouqué that the age of\r\nthe more ancient volcanic beds of Santorin belong, as shown by the\r\nincluded fossils, to the newer Pliocene epoch. These are of course the\r\nunsubmerged, and therefore more recent strata, and may have been\r\nrecently upheaved during one or more of the outbursts of volcanic\r\nenergy. But it seems an impossibility that the Gulf of Santorin, with\r\nits precipitous walls and deep circular interior channel, as shown by\r\nthe Ideal Section (Fig. 13), could have been formed otherwise than under\r\nthe air. We are led, therefore, to inquire whether there was a time in\r\nthe history of the Mediterranean, since the Eocene period, when the\r\nwaters were lower than at present. That this was the case we have clear\r\nevidence. The remains of elephants, hippopotami, and other animals,\r\nwhich have been discovered in great numbers in the Maltese caves, show\r\nthat this island was united to Sicily, and this again to Europe, during\r\nthe later Pliocene epoch, so as to have become the abode of an\r\nEuropasian fauna. According to Dr. Wallace, a causeway of dry land\r\nexisted, stretching from Italy to Tunis in North Africa through the\r\nMaltese Islands--an inference involving the lowering of the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean by several hundred feet.[2] There is every reason for\r\nsupposing that the old volcano of Santorin was in active eruption at\r\nthis period; and its history may be considered to be similar to that of\r\nVesuvius until, at the rising of the waters during the Pluvial (or\r\nPost-Pliocene) epoch, during which they rose higher than at present,\r\nSantorin was converted into a group of islands, slightly differing in\r\nform from those of the present day. This view seems to meet the\r\ndifficulties regarding the origin of this group, difficulties which\r\nLyell had long since clearly recognised.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Limit of the Mediterranean Volcanic Region._--With the Santorin\r\ngroup we conclude our account of the active European volcanoes. It may\r\nbe observed, however, that from some cause not ascertained the volcanic\r\ndistricts of the Mediterranean and its shores are confined to the north\r\nside of that great inland sea; so that as regards vulcanicity the\r\nAfrican coast presents a striking contrast to that of the opposite side.\r\nIf we draw a line from the shores of the Levant to the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, by Candia, Malta, and to the south of Pantelleria and\r\nSardinia, we shall find that the volcanic islands and districts of the\r\nmainland lie to the north of it.[3] This has doubtless some connection\r\nwith the internal geological structure. The immunity of the Libyan\r\ndesert from volcanic irruptions is in keeping with the remarkably\r\nundisturbed condition of the Secondary strata, which seldom depart much\r\nfrom the horizontal position; while the igneous rocks of the Atlas\r\nmountains are probably of great geological antiquity. On the other hand,\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary formations of the northern shores and islands\r\nof the Mediterranean are generally characterised by the highly-inclined,\r\nflexured, and folded position of the strata. Hence we may suppose that\r\nthe crust over the region lying to the north of the volcanic line, owing\r\nto its broken and ruptured condition, was less able to resist the\r\npressure of the internal forces of eruption than that lying to the south\r\nof it; and that, in consequence, vents and fissures of eruption were\r\nestablished over the former of these regions, while they are absent in\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n[1] Fuller details will be found in Daubeny's _Volcanoes_, chap. xviii.,\r\nand Lyell's _Principles of Geology_, vol. ii. p. 65 (edition 1872).

The Isle of\r\nPantelleria is apparently just on the line, which, continued eastward,\r\nprobably follows the north coast of Cyprus, parallel to the strike of\r\nthe strata and of the central axis of that island.--See \"Carte\r\nGéologique de l'île de Chypre, par MM. Albert Gaudry et Amedée Damour\"\r\n(1860).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN EXTINCT OR DORMANT VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are naturally led on from a consideration of the active volcanoes of\r\nEurope to that of volcanoes which are either dormant or extinct in the\r\nsame region. Such are to be found in Italy, Central France, both banks\r\nof the Rhine and Moselle, the Westerwald, Vogelsgebirge, and other\r\ndistricts of Germany; in Hungary, Styria, and the borders of the Grecian\r\narchipelago. But the subject is too large to be treated here in detail;\r\nand I propose to confine my observations to some selected cases which\r\nare to be found in Southern Italy, Central France, and the Rhenish\r\ndistricts, where the volcanic features are of so recent an age as to\r\npreserve their outward form and structure almost intact.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Southern Italy._--Extinct volcanoes and volcanic rocks occupy\r\nconsiderable tracts between the western flanks of the Apennines and the\r\nMediterranean coast in the Neapolitan and Roman States, forming the\r\nremarkable group of the Phlegræan fields (Campi Phlegræi), with the\r\nadjoining islands of Ischia, Procida, Nisida, Vandolena, Ponza, and\r\nPalmarola; at Melfi and Avellino. All the region around Rome extending\r\nalong the western slopes of the Apennines from Velletri to Orvieto,\r\ntogether with Mount Annato in Tuscany, is formed of volcanic material,\r\nand the same may be said of a large part of the island of Sardinia. From\r\nthese districts I shall select some points which seem to be of special\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n_Monte Nuovo and the Phlegræan Fields._--The tract of which this\r\ncelebrated district forms a part lies as it were in a bay of the\r\nApennine limestone of Jurassic age. The floor of this bay is composed of\r\npuzzolana, a name given to beds of volcanic tuff of great thickness, and\r\nrising into considerable hills in the vicinity of the city of Naples,\r\nsuch as that of St. Elmo. Its composition is peculiar, as it is chiefly\r\nformed of small pieces of pumice, obsidian, and trachyte, in beds\r\nalternating with loam, ferriferous sand, and fragments of limestone. It\r\nis evidently of marine formation, as Sir William Hamilton, Professor\r\nPilla, and others have detected sea-shells therein, of the genera\r\n_Ostræa_, _Cardium_, _Pecten_ and _Pectunculus_, _Buccinum_, etc. It is\r\ngenerally of a greyish colour, and sometimes sufficiently firm to be\r\nused as a building stone. The Roman Campagna is largely formed of\r\nsimilar materials, which were deposited at a time when the districts in\r\nquestion were submerged, and matter was being erupted from volcanic\r\nvents at various points around, and spread over the sea-bed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the character of the general floor on which the more recent\r\ncrater-cones of this district have been built. These are numerous, and\r\nall extinct with the exception of the Solfatara, near Puzzuoli, from\r\nwhich gases mixed with aqueous vapour are continually being exhaled. The\r\ngases consist of sulphuretted hydrogen mixed with a minute quantity of\r\nmuriatic acid.[1] This district is also remarkable for containing\r\nseveral lakes occupying the interiors of extinct craters; amongst\r\nothers, Lake Avernus, which, owing to its surface having been darkened\r\nby forests, and in consequence of the effluvia arising from its stagnant\r\nwaters, has had imparted to it a character of gloom and terror, so that\r\nHomer in the _Odyssey_ makes it the entrance to hell, and describes the\r\nvisit of Ulysses to it. Virgil follows in his steps. Another lake of\r\nsimilar origin is Lake Agnano. Here also is the Grotto del Cane, a\r\ncavern from which are constantly issuing volumes of carbonic acid gas\r\ncombined with much aqueous vapour, which is condensed by the coldness of\r\nthe external air, thus proving the high temperature of the ground from\r\nwhich the gaseous vapour issues. This whole volcanic region, so replete\r\nwith objects of interest,[2] may be considered, as regards its volcanic\r\ncharacter, in a moribund condition; but that it is still capable of\r\nspasmodic movement is evinced by the origin of Monte Nuovo, the most\r\nrecent of the crater-cones of the district. This mountain, rising from\r\nthe shore of the Bay of Baiæ, was suddenly formed in September 29th,\r\n1538, and rises to a height of 440 feet above the sea-level. It is a\r\ncrater-cone, and the depth of the crater has been determined by the\r\nItalian mineralogist Pini to be 421 English feet; its bottom is thus\r\nonly 19 feet above the sea-level. A portion of the base of the cone is\r\nconsidered partly to occupy the site of the Lucrine Lake, which was\r\nitself nothing more than the crater of a pre-existent volcano, and was\r\nalmost entirely filled up during the explosion of 1538. Monte Nuovo is\r\ncomposed of ashes, lapilli, and pumice-stones; and its sudden formation,\r\nheralded by earthquakes, and accompanied by the ejection of volcanic\r\nmatter mixed with fire and water, is recorded by Falconi, who vividly\r\ndepicts the terror and consternation of the inhabitants of the\r\nsurrounding country produced by this sudden and terrible outburst of\r\nvolcanic forces.[3]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Central Italy and the Roman States._--The tract bordering the\r\nwestern slopes of the Apennines northward from Naples into Tuscany, and\r\nincluding the Roman States, is characterised by volcanic rocks and\r\nphysical features of remarkable interest and variety. These occur in the\r\nform of extinct craters, sometimes filled with water, and thus converted\r\ninto circular lakes; or of extensive sheets and conical hills of tuff;\r\nor, finally, of old necks and masses of trachyte and basalt, sometimes\r\nexhibiting the columnar structure. The Eternal City itself is built on\r\nhills of volcanic material which some observers have supposed to be the\r\ncrater of a great volcano; but Ponzi, Brocchi, and Daubeny all concur in\r\nthe opinion that this is not the case, as will clearly appear from the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of the valley of the Tiber at Rome is very\r\nclearly described by Professor Ponzi in a memoir published in 1850, from\r\nwhich the accompanying section is taken.[4] (Fig. 16.) From this it will\r\nbe seen that \"the Seven-hilled City\" is built upon promontories of\r\nstratified volcanic tuff, of which the Campagna is formed, breaking off\r\nalong the banks of the Tiber, the hills being the result of the erosion,\r\nor denudation, of the strata along the side of the river valley. As the\r\nstrata dip from west to east across the course of the river, it follows\r\nthat those on the western banks are below those on the opposite side;\r\nand thus the marine sands and marls which underlie the volcanic tuff,\r\nand are concealed by it along the eastern side of the valley, emerge on\r\nthe west, and form the range of hills on that side. Such being the\r\nstructure of the formations under Rome, it is evident that it is not\r\n\"built on a volcano.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Geological Section across the Valley of the\r\nTiber at Rome. 1. Alluvium of the Tiber; 2. Diluvium; 3. Volcanic tuff\r\n(recent deposits); 4. Sands, etc.; 5. Blue marl (sub-Apennine\r\ndeposits).]\r\n\r\nThe tuff contains fragments of lava and pebbles of Apennine limestone,\r\nand was deposited under the waters of an extensive lake at a time when\r\nvolcanic action was rife amidst the Alban Hills. This lacustrine\r\nformation rests in turn on deposits of marine origin, containing\r\noysters, patellæ, and other sea-shells, of which the chain of hills on\r\nthe right bank of the Tiber is chiefly formed.\r\n\r\nThe district around Albano lying to the south of Rome is of peculiar\r\ninterest from the assemblage of old crater-lakes which it contains; as,\r\nfor instance, those of Albano, Vallariccia, Nemi, Juturna, and the lake\r\nof Gabii. The lake of Albano, one of the most beautiful sheets of water\r\nin the world, is about six miles in circumference, and surrounded by\r\nbeds of peperino, a variety of tuff presenting a bright, undecomposed\r\naspect when newly broken. The level of this lake was lowered by the\r\nRomans during the siege of Veii by means of a tunnel, so that the waters\r\nare 200 feet lower than the level at which they originally stood. In the\r\nsame district is the lake of Nemi, very regular in its circular outline;\r\nthat of Juturna lying near the foot of the Alban Hills, and that of\r\nAriccia lying in a deep hollow eight miles in circumference;--all may be\r\nsupposed to have been the craters of extinct volcanoes, both by reason\r\nof their shape and of the materials of which they are formed. All these\r\nold craters are, however, according to Daubeny, \"only the dependencies\r\nand offshoots, as it were, of the great extinct volcano, the traces of\r\nwhich still remain upon the summit of the Alban Hills, and which is\r\ncomparable in its form to that of Vesuvius, as it is surrounded by an\r\nouter circle of volcanic rock comparable to that of Somma.\"[5]\r\n\r\nTo the north of the city of Rome are several crateriform lakes, some of\r\nwhich are of great size, such as that of Bolsena, over twenty miles in\r\ncircumference, and the Lago di Bracciano, almost as large, and lying\r\nabout twelve miles from the city. These extensive sheets of water are\r\nsurrounded by banks of tuff and volcanic sand, in which fragments of\r\naugite, leucite, and crystals of titanite are distributed. The town of\r\nViterbo is built up at the foot of a steep hill called Monte Cimini, the\r\nlower part of which is composed of trachyte; this is surmounted by\r\ntuff, which appears to have been ejected from an extinct crater\r\noccupying the summit of the mountain, and now converted into a lake\r\ncalled the Lake of Vico. This crater is perfectly circular, and from its\r\ncentre rises a little conical hill covered by trees.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Physical History._--Space does not permit of a fuller\r\ndescription of the remarkable volcanic features of the tract lying along\r\nthe western slope of the Apennines; but from what has been stated it\r\nwill be clear that volcanic forces have been in operation at one time on\r\na grand scale in the Roman States and the South of Tuscany, over a tract\r\nextending from Mount Annato to Velletri and Segni.\r\n\r\nThis tract was separated from that of the Neapolitan volcanic region by\r\na range of limestone hills of Jurassic age between Segni and Gaeta, a\r\nprotrusion of the Alban Hills westward; but the general structure and\r\nphysical history of both regions are probably very similar, with the\r\nexception that the igneous forces still retain their vitality in the\r\nmore southerly region. In the case of the Roman volcanic district, a bay\r\nseems to have been formed about the close of the Miocene period, bounded\r\non all sides but the west by hills of limestone, over whose bed strata\r\nof marl, sandstone, and conglomerate were deposited. This tract was\r\nconverted by subsequent movements into a fresh-water lake, and\r\ncontemporaneously volcanic operations commenced over the whole region,\r\nand beds of tuff, often containing blocks of rock ejected from\r\nneighbouring craters, were deposited over those of marine origin.\r\nMeanwhile numerous crater-cones were thrown up; and, as the land\r\ngradually rose, the waters of the lake were drained off, leaving dry\r\nthe Campagna and plain of the Tiber. Ultimately the volcanic fires\r\nsmouldered down and died out, whether within the historic epoch or not\r\nis uncertain; lakes were formed within the now dormant craters, and the\r\nface of nature gradually assumed a more placid and less forbidding\r\naspect over this memorable region, destined to be the site of Rome, the\r\nMistress of the World.\r\n\r\n[1] As determined by Daubeny in 1825.\r\n\r\n[2] Including the ruins of the Temple of Serapis, whose pillars are\r\nperforated by marine boring shells up to a height of about 16 feet from\r\ntheir base; indicating that the land had sunk down beneath the sea, and\r\nafterwards been elevated to its present level.\r\n\r\n[3] The account of Falconi, and another by Pietro Giacomo di Toledo, are\r\ngiven by Sir W. Hamilton, _op. cit._, p. 198, and also reproduced by Sir\r\nC. Lyell, _Principles_, vol. i. p. 608.\r\n\r\n[4] Guiseppe Ponzi, \"Sulla storia fisica del Bacino di Roma,\" _Annali di\r\nScienze Fisiche_ (Roma, 1850).\r\n\r\n[5] Daubeny, _Volcanoes_, p. 171.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEXTINCT VOLCANOES OF CENTRAL FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a._) _General Structure of the Auvergne District._--From a granitic\r\nand gneissose platform situated near the centre of France, and separated\r\nfrom the western spurs of the Alps by the wide valley of the Rhone,\r\nthere rises a group of volcanic mountains surpassing in variety of form\r\nand structure any similar mountain group in Europe, and belonging to an\r\nepoch ranging from the Middle Tertiary down almost to the present day.\r\nThis volcanic group of mountains gives rise to several important rivers,\r\nsuch as the Loire, the Allier, the Soule (a branch of the Loire), the\r\nCreuse, the Dordogne, and the Lot; and in the Plomb du Cantal attains an\r\nelevation of 6130 feet above the sea. Its southern section, that of Mont\r\nDore, the Cantal, and the Haute Loire, is characterised by magnificent\r\nvalleys, traversing plateaux of volcanic lava, and exhibiting the\r\nresults of river erosion on a grand scale; while its northern section,\r\nthat of the Puy de Dôme, presents to us a varied succession of volcanic\r\ncrater-cones and domes, with their extruded lava-streams, almost as\r\nfresh and unchanged in form as if they had only yesterday become\r\nextinct. A somewhat similar, but less important, chain of extinct\r\nvolcanoes also occurs in the Velay and Vivarais, between the upper\r\nwaters of the Loire and the Allier, in the vicinity of the town of Le\r\nPuy.[1] The principal city in this region is Clermont-Ferrand, lying\r\nnear the base of the Puy de Dôme, and ever memorable as the birthplace\r\nof Blaise Pascal.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Generalised Section through the Puy de Dôme and\r\nVale of Clermont, distance about ten miles. The general floor formed of\r\ngranite and gneiss (G); D. Domite-lava of the Puy de Dôme; Sc. Cones of\r\nashes and scoriæ; L. Lava-sheets; A. Alluvium of the Vale of Clermont\r\nand Lake deposits.]\r\n\r\nThe physical structure of this region is on the whole very simple. The\r\nfundamental rocks consist of granite and gneiss passing into schist, all\r\nof extreme geological antiquity, forming a vast platform gradually\r\nrising in a southerly direction towards the head waters of the Loire\r\nand the Allier in the Departments of Haute Loire, Lozère, and Ardèche.\r\nOn this platform are planted the whole of the volcanic mountains. (See\r\nFig. 17.)\r\n\r\nThe granitic plateau is bounded on the east, throughout a distance of\r\nabout 50 miles, by the wide and fertile plain of Clermont, watered by\r\nthe Allier and its numerous branches descending from the volcanic\r\nmountains, and is about 25 miles in width from east to west in the\r\nparallel of Clermont, but gradually narrowing in a southerly direction,\r\ntill at Brioude it becomes an ordinary mountain ravine. The eastern\r\nmargin of the plain is formed by another granitic ridge expanding into a\r\nplateau towards the south, and joining in with that already described;\r\nbut towards the north and directly east of Clermont it forms a high\r\nridge traversed by the railway to St. Étienne and Lyons, and descending\r\ntowards the east into the valley of the Loire. No more impressive view\r\nis to be obtained of the volcanic region than that from the summit of\r\nthis second ridge, on arriving there towards evening from the city of\r\nLyons. At your feet lies the richly-cultivated plain of Clermont, dotted\r\nwith towns, villages, and hamlets, and decorated with pastures,\r\norchards, vineyards, and numerous trees; while beyond rises the granitic\r\nplateau, breaking off abruptly along the margin of the plain, and deeply\r\nindented by the valleys and gorges along which the streams descend to\r\njoin the Allier. But the chief point of interest is the chain of\r\nvolcanic crater-cones and dome-shaped eminences which rise from the\r\nplateau, amongst which the Puy de Dôme towers supreme. Their individual\r\nforms stand out in clear and sharp relief against the western sky, and\r\ngradually fade away towards the south into the serried masses of Mont\r\nDore and Cantal, around whose summits the evening mists are gathering.\r\nExcept the first view of the Mont Blanc range from the crest of the\r\nJura, there is no scene perhaps which is calculated to impress itself\r\nmore vividly on the memory than that here faintly described.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Transverse view of the Puy de Dôme and\r\nneighbouring volcanoes from the Puy de Chopine.--(After Scrope.)]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _The Vale of Clermont._--The plain upon which we look down was\r\nonce the floor of an extensive lake, for it is composed of various\r\nstrata of sand, clay, marl, and limestone, containing various genera and\r\nspecies of fresh-water shells. These strata are of great thickness,\r\nperhaps a thousand feet in some places; and along with such shells as\r\n_Paludina_, _Planorbis_, and _Limnæa_ are also found remains of various\r\nother animals, such as fish, serpents, batrachians, crocodiles,\r\nruminants, and those of huge pachyderms, as _Rhinoceros_, _Dinotherium_,\r\nand _Cænotherium_. This great lake, occupying a hollow in the old\r\ngranitic platform of Central France, must have been in existence for an\r\nextensive period, which MM. Pomel, Aymard, and Lyell all unite in\r\nreferring to that of the Lower Miocene. But what is to us of special\r\ninterest is the fact that, in the deposits of this lake of the Haute\r\nLoire, with the exception of the very latest, there is no intermixture\r\nof volcanic products such as might have been expected to occur if the\r\nneighbouring volcanoes had been in activity during its existence. Hence\r\nit may be supposed that, as Scrope suggested, the waters of the lake\r\nwere drained off owing to the disturbance in the levels of the country\r\ncaused by the first explosions of the Auvergne volcanoes.[4] If this be\r\nso, then we possess a key by which to determine the period of the first\r\nformation of volcanoes in Central France; for, as the animal remains\r\nenclosed in the lacustrine deposits of the Vale of Clermont belong to\r\nthe early Miocene stage, and the earliest traces of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic _ejecta_ are found only in the uppermost deposits, we may\r\nconclude that the first outburst of volcanic action occurred towards the\r\nclose of the Miocene period--a period remarkable for similar exhibitions\r\nof internal igneous action in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Successive Stages of Volcanic Action in Auvergne._--The volcanic\r\nregion here described, which has an area of about one hundred square\r\nmiles, does not appear to have been at one and the same period of time\r\nthe theatre of volcanic action over its whole extent. On the contrary,\r\nthis action appears to have commenced at the southern border of the\r\nregion in the Cantal, and travelling northwards, to have broken out in\r\nthe Mont Dore region; finally terminating its outward manifestations\r\namong the craters and domes of the Puy de Dôme. In a similar manner the\r\nvolcanic eruptions of the Haute Loire and Ardèche, lying to the\r\neastward, and separated from those of the Cantal by the granitoid ridge\r\nof the Montagnes de Margeride, belong to two successive periods\r\nreferable very closely to those of the Mont Dore and the Puy de Dôme\r\ngroups.[5] The evidence in support of this view is very clear and\r\nconclusive; for, while the volcanic craters formed of ash, lapilli, and\r\nscoriæ, together with the rounded domes of trachytic rock of which the\r\nPuy de Dôme group is composed, preserve the form and surface indications\r\nof recently extinguished volcanoes, those which we may assume to have\r\nbeen piled up in the region of Mont Dore and Cantal have been entirely\r\nswept away by prolonged rain and river action, and the sites of the\r\nancient craters and cones of eruption are only to be determined by\r\ntracing the great sheets of lava up the sides of the valleys to their\r\nsources, generally situated at the culminating points of their\r\nrespective groups. Other points of evidence of the great antiquity of\r\nthe latter groups might be adduced from the extent of the erosion which\r\nhas taken place in the sheets of lava having their sources in the vents\r\nof the Plomb du Cantal and of Mont Dore, owing to which, magnificent\r\nvalleys, many miles in length and hundreds of feet in depth, have been\r\ncut out of these sheets of lava and their supporting rocks, whether\r\ngranitic or lacustrine, and the materials carried away by the streams\r\nwhich flow along their beds. These points will be better understood when\r\nI come to give an account of the several groups; and in doing so I will\r\ncommence with that of the Cantal.[6]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _The Volcanoes of the Cantal._--The original crater-cones of\r\nthis group have entirely disappeared throughout the long ages which have\r\nelapsed since the lava-streams issued forth from their internal\r\nreservoirs. The general figure of this group of volcanic mountains is\r\nthat of a depressed cone, whose sides slope away in all directions from\r\nthe central heights, which are deeply eroded by streams rising near the\r\napex and flowing downwards in all directions towards the circumference\r\nof the mountain, where they enter the Lot, the Dordogne, and the Allier.\r\nThe orifice of eruption was situated at the Plomb du Cantal, formed of\r\nsolid masses of trachyte, which, owing, as Mr. Scrope supposes, to a\r\nhigh degree of fluidity, were able to extend to great distances in\r\nextensive sheets, and were afterwards covered by repeated and\r\nwidely-spread flows of basalt; so that the trachyte towards the margin\r\nof the volcanic area becomes less conspicuous than the basalt by which\r\nit is more or less concealed from view, or overlapped. Extensive beds of\r\ntuff and breccia accompany the trachytic masses.\r\n\r\nMagnificent sections of the rocks are laid open to view along the sides\r\nof the valleys, which are steep and rock-bound. Except towards the\r\nsouth-west, about Aurillac, where lacustrine strata overlie the granite,\r\nthe platform from which rises the volcanic dome is composed of granitic\r\nor gneissose rocks. Accompanying the lava-streams are great beds of\r\nvolcanic agglomerate, which Mr. Scrope considers to have been formed\r\ncontemporaneously with the lava which they envelop, and to be due to\r\ntorrents of water tumultuously descending the sides of the volcano at\r\nperiods of eruption, and bearing down immense volumes of its fragmental\r\n_ejecta_ in company with its lava-streams.[7] Nowhere throughout this\r\nregion do beds of trachyte and basalt alternate with one another; in all\r\ncases the basalt is the newer of the two varieties of rock, and this is\r\ngenerally the case throughout the region here described.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Volcanoes of Mont Dore._--This mountain lies to the north of\r\nthat of Cantal, and somewhat resembles it in general structure and\r\nconfiguration. Like Cantal, it is destitute of any distinct crater; all\r\nthat is left of the central focus of eruption being the solidified\r\nmatter which filled the throat of the original volcano, and which forms\r\na rocky mass of lava, rising in its highest point, the Pic de Saucy, to\r\nan elevation (as given by Ramond) of 6258 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, thus exceeding that of the Plomb du Cantal by 128 feet. Its figure\r\nwill be best understood by supposing seven or eight rocky summits\r\ngrouped together within a circle of about a mile in diameter, from\r\nwhence, as from the apex of an irregular and flattened cone, all the\r\nsides slope more or less rapidly downwards, until their inclination is\r\ngradually lost in the plain around. This dome-shaped mass has been\r\ndeeply eroded on opposite sides by the valleys of the Dordogne and\r\nChambon; while it is further furrowed by numerous minor streams.[8]\r\n\r\nThe great beds of volcanic rock, disposed as above stated, consist of\r\nprodigious layers of scoriæ, pumice-stones, and detritus, alternating\r\nwith beds of trachyte and basalt, which often descend in uninterrupted\r\ncurrents till they reach the granite platform, and then spread\r\nthemselves for miles around. The sheets of basalt are found to stretch\r\nto greater distances than those of trachyte, and have flowed as far as\r\n15 or 20 miles from their orifices of eruption; while in some cases, on\r\nthe east and north sides, they have extended as far as 25 or 30 miles\r\nfrom the central height. On the other hand, a radius of about ten miles\r\nfrom the centre would probably include all the streams of trachyte;--so\r\nmuch greater has been the viscosity of the basalt over the latter rock.\r\nSome portions of these great sheets of lava, cut off by river valleys or\r\neroded areas from the main mass of which they once formed a part, are\r\nfound forming isolated terraces and plateaux either on the granitic\r\nplatform, or resting on the fresh-water strata of the valley of the\r\nAllier, while in a northern direction they overspread a large portion of\r\nthe granitic plateau from which rise the Puy de Dôme and associated\r\nvolcanic mountains. Still more remarkable are the cases in which these\r\nlava-streams have descended into the old river channels which drained\r\nthe granitic plateau. Thus the current which took its origin in the Puy\r\nGros descended into the valley of the Dordogne, while another stream\r\ninvaded the gorge of Champeix on the eastern side.\r\n\r\nThe more ancient lava-streams just described are invaded by currents and\r\nsurmounted by cones of eruption of more recent date, similar to those of\r\nthe Puy de Dôme group lying to the northward. Such cones and currents,\r\namongst which are the Puy de Tartaret and that of Montenard, present\r\nexactly the same characters as those of this group, to which we shall\r\nreturn further on.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Volcanoes of the Haute Loire and Ardèche._--Separated by the\r\nvalley of the Allier and the granitic ridge of La Margeride from the\r\nvolcanic regions of Cantal and Mont Dore is another volcanic region of\r\ngreat extent, which reaches its highest elevation in the central points\r\nof Mont Mezen, attaining an elevation (according to Cordier) of 5820\r\nfeet, and formed of \"clinkstone.\" The volcanic products of Mezen have\r\nbeen erupted from one central orifice of vast size, and consist mainly\r\nof extensive sheets of \"clinkstone,\" a variety of trachytic lava, which\r\nhave taken courses mainly towards the north-west and south-east. These\r\ngreat sheets, one of which appears to have covered a space more than 26\r\nmiles in length with an average breadth of 6 miles, thus overspreading\r\nan estimated area of 156 square miles, has been deeply eroded by streams\r\ndraining into the Loire, along whose banks the rocks tower in lofty\r\ncliffs; while it has also suffered enormous denudation, by which\r\noutlying fragments are disconnected from the main mass, and form\r\nflat-topped hills and plateaux as far distant as Roche en Reigner and\r\nBeauzac, at the extreme distance (as stated above) of 26 miles from the\r\nsource of eruption.\r\n\r\nBut even more remarkable than the above are the vast basaltic sheets\r\nwhich stretch away for a distance of 30 miles by Privas almost to the\r\nbanks of the Rhône, opposite Montlimart. These have their origin amongst\r\nthe clinkstone heights of Mont Mezen, and taking their course along the\r\ngranitic plateau in a south-easterly direction, ultimately pass over on\r\nto the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations composing the plateau of the\r\nCoiron, which break off in vertical cliffs from 300 to 400 feet in\r\nheight, surmounting the slopes that rise from the banks of the Ardèche\r\nand Escourtais rivers near Villeneuve de Bere. This is probably one of\r\nthe most extensive sheets of basalt with which we are acquainted in the\r\nEuropean area, and it is only a remnant of a vastly greater original\r\nsheet.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Mont Demise, near Le Puy, seen from the S.E.\r\n(After Scrope.)--1. Building standing on old breccia, rocks of the Col;\r\n2. Road to Brioude; 3. Croix de la Paille; 4. Orgue d'Expailly (basalt);\r\n5. Spot where human bones were found.]\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Newer Volcanoes of the Haute Loire (the Velay and\r\nVivarais)._--Subsequently to the formation of the lava-streams above\r\ndescribed, and probably after the lapse of a lengthened period, the\r\nregion of the Haute Loire and Ardèche became the scene of a fresh\r\noutburst of volcanic action, during which the surface of the older\r\nlavas, or of the fundamental granite, was covered by numerous\r\ncrater-cones and lava-streams strewn along the banks of the Allier and\r\nof the Loire for many miles. These cones and craters are not quite so\r\nfresh as those of the Mont Dôme group; those of the Haute Loire being\r\nslightly earlier in point of time, and, as Daubeny shows, belonging to a\r\ndifferent system. So numerous are these more recent cones and craters\r\nthat Scrope counted more than 150 of them, and probably omitted many.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic phenomena now described have a special interest as bearing\r\non the question whether man was an inhabitant of this region at the time\r\nof these later eruptions. The question seems to be answered in the\r\naffirmative by the discovery of a human skull and several bones in the\r\nvolcanic breccia of Mont Demise, in company with remains of the elephant\r\n(_E. primigenius_), rhinoceros (_R. tichorhinus_), stag, and other large\r\nmammifers. The discovery of these remains was made in the year 1844, and\r\nthe circumstances were fully investigated and reported upon by M.\r\nAymard, and afterwards by Mr. Poulett Scrope, upon whose mind no\r\npossible doubt of the fact remained. From what we now know of the\r\noccurrence of human remains and works of art in other parts of France\r\nand Europe, no surprise need be felt at the occurrence of human remains\r\nin company with some extinct mammalia in these volcanic tuffs, which\r\nbelong to the Post-Pliocene or superficial alluvia antecedent to the\r\nhistoric period.[10]\r\n\r\n(_h._) _Mont Dôme Chain._--We now come to the consideration of the most\r\nrecent of all the volcanic mountain groups of the region of Central\r\nFrance, that of the Puy de Dôme, lying to the north of Mont Dore and\r\nCantal. We have seen that there is almost conclusive evidence that man\r\nwas a witness to the later volcanic outbursts of the Vivarais, and as\r\nthese craters seem to be of somewhat earlier date than those of the Puy\r\nde Dôme group, we cannot doubt that they were in active eruption when\r\nhuman beings inhabited the country, and not improbably within what is\r\nknown as the _Historic Period_. No mention, however, is made either by\r\nCæsar, Pliny, or other Roman writers of the existence of active\r\nvolcanoes in this region. Cæsar, who was a close observer, and who\r\ncarried the Roman arms into Auvergne, makes no mention of such; nor yet\r\ndoes the elder Pliny, who enumerated the known burning mountains of his\r\nday all over the Roman Empire. It is not till we come down to the fifth\r\ncentury of our era that we find any notices which might lead us to infer\r\nthe existence of volcanic action in Central France. This is the\r\nwell-known letter written by Sidonius Apollonarius, bishop of Auvergne,\r\nto Alcinus Avitus, bishop of Vienne, in which the former refers to\r\ncertain terrific terrestrial manifestations which had occurred in the\r\ndiocese of the latter. But, as Dr. Daubeny observes, this is no evidence\r\nof volcanic action in Auvergne, where Sidonius himself resided; the\r\nterrestrial disturbances above referred to may have been earthquake\r\nshocks of extreme severity.[11]\r\n\r\nBut although we have no reliably historical record of volcanic action\r\namongst the mountains of the Mont Dôme group, the fact that these are,\r\ncomparatively, extremely recent will be evident to an observer visiting\r\nthis district, and this conclusion is based on three principal grounds:\r\nfirst, because of the well-preserved forms of the original craters,\r\nthough generally composed of very loose material, such as ashes,\r\nlapilli, and slag; secondly, because of the freshness of the\r\nlava-streams over whose rugged surfaces even a scanty herbage has in\r\nsome places scarcely found a footing;[12] and thirdly, because the lava\r\nfrom the crater-cones has invaded channels previously occupied by the\r\nearlier lavas, or those which had been eroded since the overflow of the\r\ngreat basaltic sheets of Mont Dore. Still, as in the case of the valleys\r\nof Lake Aidot, of Channonat, and of Royat, these streams are\r\nsufficiently ancient to have given time for the existing rivers to have\r\nworn out in them channels of some depth, but bearing no comparison to\r\nthe great valleys which had been eroded out of the more ancient lavas,\r\nsuch as those of the Coiron, of the Ardèche, and of the Dordogne and\r\nChambon in the district of Mont Dore.\r\n\r\n(_i._) _Dome-shaped Volcanic Hills._--I have previously (page 15)\r\nreferred to the two classes of volcanic eminences to be found in the\r\nchain of the Puy de Dôme; one indicated by the name itself, formed of a\r\nvariety of trachytic lava called \"domite,\" and of the form of a dome;\r\nthe other, composed of fragmental matter piled up in the form of a\r\ncrater or cup, often ruptured on one side by a stream of lava which has\r\nburst through the side, owing to its superior density. Of the former\r\nclass the Puy de Dôme and the Grand Sarcoui (see Fig. 18) are the most\r\nstriking examples out of the five enumerated by Scrope, while there is a\r\nlarge number, altogether sixty-one, belonging to the latter class. These\r\ndomes and crater-cones, as already stated, rise from a platform of\r\ngranite, either directly or from one formed of the lava-sheets of the\r\nMont Dore region, which in turn overlies the granitic platform. Of the\r\nnearly perfect craters there are the Petit Puy de Dôme, lying partially\r\nagainst the northern flank of the greater eminence; the Puy de Cone,\r\nremarkable for the symmetry of its conical form, rising to a height of\r\n900 feet from the plain; and the Puys de Chaumont and Thiolet lying to\r\nthe north of the Puy de Dôme. Of those to the south of this mount, two\r\nout of the three craters of the Puy de Barme and the Puy de Vichatel are\r\nperfect; but most of the crater-cones south of the Puy de Dôme are\r\nbreached. Some of the lava streams by which these craters were broken\r\ndown flowed for long distances. That the lava followed the showers of\r\nashes and lapilli forming the walls of the craters is rendered very\r\nevident in the case of the Puy de la Vache, whose lava-stream coalescing\r\nwith those from the Puy de la Solas and Puy Noir, deluged the\r\nsurrounding tracts and flowed down the Channonat Valley as far as La\r\nRoche Blanc in the Vale of Clermont. In the interior of the upper part\r\nof the crater still remaining may be seen the level (so to speak) to\r\nwhich the molten lava rose before it burst its barrier. This level is\r\nmarked by a projecting platform of reddish or yellow material, rich in\r\nspecular iron, apparently part of the frothy scum which formed on the\r\nsurface of the lava and adhered to the side of the basin at the moment\r\nof its being emptied.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit a fuller description of this remarkable assemblage\r\nof extinct volcanoes, and the reader must be referred for further\r\ndetails to the work of Mr. Scrope. I shall content myself with some\r\nfurther reference to the central figure in this grand chain, the Puy de\r\nDôme itself.\r\n\r\n_Ascent of the Puy de Dôme._--On ascending by the winding path up the\r\nsteep side of the mount, and on reaching the somewhat flattened summit,\r\nthe first objects which strike the eye are the massive foundations of\r\nthe Roman temple of Mercury; they are hewn out of solid grey lava,\r\naltogether different from the rock of the Puy de Dôme itself, which must\r\nhave been obtained from one of the lava-sheets of the Mont Dore group.\r\nTo have carried these large blocks to their present resting-place must\r\nhave cost no little labour and effort. The temple is supposed to have\r\nbeen surmounted by a colossal statue of the winged deity, visible from\r\nall parts of the surrounding country which was dedicated to his honour,\r\nand the foundations were only discovered a few years ago when excavating\r\nfor the foundation of the observatory, which stands a little further on\r\nunder the charge of Professor Janssen. On proceeding to the northern\r\ncrest of the platform a wonderful view of the extinct craters and\r\ndomes--about forty in number, and terminating in the Puy de Beauny, the\r\nmost northerly member of the chain--is presented to the spectator. To\r\nthe right is the Vale of Clermont and the rich valley of the Allier\r\nmerging into the great plain of Central France. On the south side of the\r\nplatform a no less remarkable spectacle meets the eye. The chain of Puys\r\nand broken craters stretches away southwards for a distance of nearly\r\nten miles, while the horizon is bounded in that direction by the lofty\r\nmasses of the Mont Dore, Cantal, and Le Puy ranges. Nor does it require\r\nmuch effort of the imagination to restore the character of the region\r\nwhen these now dormant volcanoes were in full activity, projecting\r\nshowers of ashes and stones high into the air amidst flames of fire and\r\nvast clouds of incandescent gas and steam.\r\n\r\nThe material of which the Puy de Dôme is formed consists of a light\r\ngrey, nearly white, soft felsitic lava, containing crystals of mica,\r\nhornblende, and specular iron-ore. It is highly vesicular, and was\r\nprobably extruded in a pasty condition from a throat piercing the\r\ngranitic plateau and the overlying sheet of ancient lava of Mont Dore.\r\nIt has been suggested that such highly felsitic and acid lavas as that\r\nof which the Puy de Dôme, the Grand Sarcoui, and Cliersou are composed,\r\nmay have had their origin in the granite itself, melted and rendered\r\nviscous by intense heat. Dr. E. Gordon Hull has suggested that the\r\ndomite hills (owing to their low specific gravity) may have filled up\r\npre-existing craters of ashes and scoriæ without rupturing them, as in\r\nthe case of the heavier basaltic lavas, and then still continuing to be\r\nextruded, may have entirely enveloped them in its mass; so that each\r\ndomite hill encloses within its interior a crater formed of ashes,\r\nstones, and scoriæ. In the case of the Puy de Dôme there is some\r\nevidence that the domite matter rests on a basis of ashes and scoriæ,\r\nwhich may be seen in a few places around the base of the cone. It is\r\ndifficult without some such theory as this to explain how a viscous mass\r\nwas able to raise mountains some 2000 or 3000 feet above the surrounding\r\nplain.[13]\r\n\r\n(_j._) _Sketch of the Volcanic History of Central France._--It now only\r\nremains to give a brief _resumé_ of the volcanic history of this region\r\nas it may be gathered from the relations of the rocks and strata to the\r\nvolcanic products, and of these latter to each other.\r\n\r\n_1st Stage._--It would appear that at the close of the Eocene period\r\ngreat terrestrial changes occurred. The bed of the sea was converted\r\ninto dry land, the strata were flexured and denuded, and a depression\r\nwas formed in the granitic floor of Central France, which, in the\r\nsucceeding Miocene period, was converted into an extensive lake peopled\r\nby molluscs, fishes, reptiles, and pachyderms of the period.\r\n\r\n_2nd Stage._--Towards the close of the Miocene epoch volcanic eruptions\r\ncommenced on a grand scale over the granitic platform in the districts\r\nnow called Mont Dore, Cantal, and the Vivarais. Vast sheets of trachytic\r\nand basaltic lavas successively invaded the tracts surrounding the\r\ncentral orifices of eruption, now constituting the more ancient of the\r\nlava-sheets of the Auvergne region, and, invading the waters of the\r\nneighbouring lake, overspread the lacustrine deposits which were being\r\naccumulated therein. These volcanic eruptions probably continued\r\nthroughout the Pliocene period, interrupted by occasional intervals of\r\ninactivity, and ultimately altogether ceased.\r\n\r\n_3rd Stage._--Towards the close of the Pliocene period terrestrial\r\nmovements took place, owing to which the waters of the lake began to\r\nfall away, and the sheets of lava were subjected to great denudation.\r\nThis process, probably accelerated by excessive rainfall during the\r\nsucceeding Post-Pliocene and Pluvial periods, was continued until plains\r\nand extensive river-valleys were eroded out of the sheets of lava and\r\ntheir supporting granitic rocks and the adjoining lacustrine strata.\r\n\r\n_4th Stage._--A new outburst of volcanic forces marks this stage, during\r\nwhich the chain of the Puy de Dôme was thrown up on the west, and that\r\nof the newer cones of the Vivarais on the south-east of the lacustrine\r\ntract. The waters of the lake were now completely drained away through\r\nthe channel of the Allier, and denudation, extending down to the present\r\nday, began over the area now forming the Vale of Clermont and adjoining\r\ndistricts. The volcanic action ultimately spent its force; and somewhere\r\nabout the time of the appearance of man, the mammoth, rhinoceros, stag,\r\nand reindeer on the scene, eruptions entirely ceased, and gradually the\r\nregion assumed those conditions of repose by which it is now physically\r\ncharacterised.\r\n\r\n[1] The literature referring to this region is very extensive. Guettard\r\nin 1775, afterwards Faujas, published descriptions of the rocks of the\r\nVivarais and Velay; and Desmarest's geological map, published in 1779,\r\nis a work of great merit. The district was afterwards described by\r\nDaubeny, Lyell, Von Buch, and others; but by far the most complete work\r\nis that of Scrope, entitled _Volcanoes of Central France_, containing\r\nmaps and numerous illustrations, published in 1826, and republished in a\r\nmore extended form in 1858; to this I am largely indebted.\r\n\r\n[2] A monument to Pascal, erected by the citizens, occupies the centre\r\nof the square in Clermont. It will be remembered that Pascal verified\r\nthe conclusions arrived at by Torricelli regarding the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, by carrying a Torricellian tube to the summit of the Puy de\r\nDôme, and recording how the mercury continually fell during the ascent,\r\nand rose as he descended. This experiment was made in 1645.\r\n\r\n[3] In this visit to Auvergne in the summer of 1880, the author was\r\naccompanied by his son, Dr. E. Gordon Hull, and Sir Robert S. Ball. On\r\nreaching the station at the summit of the ridge it seemed as if the\r\nvolcanic fires had again been lighted, for the whole sky was aglow with\r\nthe rays of the western sun.\r\n\r\n[4] On the other hand, certain beds of ash and other volcanic _ejecta_\r\noccur in _the uppermost_ strata of lake deposits of Limagne, so that\r\nthese may indicate the commencement of the period of eruption, as\r\nsuggested further on.\r\n\r\n[5] Only very closely; for Mr. Scrope considers that the crater-cones of\r\nthe chain of the Haute Loire give evidence of a somewhat earlier epoch\r\nof activity than those of the Puy de Dôme, as they have undergone a\r\ngreater amount of subaerial erosion.\r\n\r\n[6] The extent of this river erosion has been clearly brought out by\r\nScrope, and is admirably illustrated by several of his panoramic views,\r\nsuch as that in Plate IX. of his work.\r\n\r\n[7] Scrope, _loc. cit._, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[8] Scrope, _loc. cit._, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[9] Scrope gives a view of these remarkable basaltic cliffs in Plate\r\nXII. of his work, from which the above account is taken. At one spot\r\nnear the village of Le Gua there is a break in the continuity of the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\n[10] See Scrope, _loc. cit._, p. 181; also Appendix, p. 228. While there\r\nis no _primâ facie_ reason for questioning the origin of the Demise\r\nskull, yet from what Lyell states in his _Antiquity of Man_, p. 196, it\r\nwill be seen that he found it impossible to identify its position, or to\r\ndetermine beyond question that its interment was due to natural causes.\r\nBut assuming this to be the case, he shows how the individual to whom it\r\nbelonged might have been enveloped in volcanic tuff or mud showered down\r\nduring the final eruption of the volcano of Demise. MM. Hébert and\r\nLartet, on visiting the locality, also failed to find _in situ_ any\r\nexact counterpart of the stone now in the museum of Le Puy.\r\n\r\n[11] See Daubeny, _Volcanoes_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[12] That is to say, the surfaces of the lava-streams are not at all, or\r\nonly slightly, decomposed into soil suitable for the growth of plants,\r\nexcept in rare instances.\r\n\r\n[13] E. G. Hull, \"On the Domite Mountains of Central France,\" _Scien.\r\nProc. Roy. Dublin Society_, July 1881, p. 145. Dr. Hull determined the\r\ndensity of the domite of the Puy de Dôme to be 2.5, while that of lava\r\nis about 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANIC DISTRICT OF THE RHINE VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region bordering the Rhine along both its banks above Bonn, and\r\nextending thence along the valley of the Moselle and into the Eifel, has\r\nbeen the theatre of active volcanic phenomena down into recent times,\r\nbut at the present day the volcanoes are dormant or extinct.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Geological Structure._--The fundamental rocks of this region\r\nbelong to the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous systems, consisting\r\nof schists, grits, and limestones, with occasional horizontal beds of\r\nMiocene sandstone and shale with lignite, resting on the upturned edges\r\nof the older rocks. Scattered over the greater part of the district here\r\nreferred to are a number of conical eminences, often with craters, the\r\nbottoms of which are usually sunk much below the present level of the\r\ncountry, and thus receiving the surface drainage, have been converted\r\ninto little lakes called \"maars,\" differing from ordinary lakes by their\r\ncircular form and the absence of any _apparent_ outlet for their\r\nwaters.[1]\r\n\r\nBut before entering into details, it may be desirable to present the\r\nreader with a short outline of the physical history of the region (which\r\nhas been ably done by Dr. Hibbert in his treatise, to which I have\r\nalready referred), so as to enable him better to understand the\r\nsuccession of physical events in its volcanic history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Sketch Map to show the physical condition of\r\nthe Rhenish area in the Miocene epoch.--(After Hibbert.)]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Physical History._--From the wide distribution of stratified\r\ndeposits of sand and clay at high levels on both banks of the Rhine\r\nnorth of the Moselle, it would appear that an extensive fresh-water\r\nbasin, which Dr. Hibbert calls \"The Basin of Neuwied,\" occupied a\r\nconsiderable tract on both banks, in the centre of which the present\r\ncity of Neuwied stands. This basin was bounded towards the south by the\r\nslopes of the Hündsruck and Taunus, which at the time here referred to\r\nformed a continuous chain of mountains. (Fig. 20.) To the south of this\r\nchain lay the Tertiary basin of Mayence, which was connected at an early\r\nperiod--that of the Miocene--with the waters of the ocean, as shown by\r\nthe fact that the lower strata contain marine shells; these afterwards\r\ngave place to fresh-water conditions. The basin of Neuwied was bounded\r\ntowards the north by a ridge of Devonian strata which extended across\r\nthe present gorge of the Rhine between Andernach and Linz, and to the\r\nnorth of this barrier lay another more extensive fresh-water basin, that\r\nof Cologne. From this it will be seen that the Rhine, as we now find it,\r\nhad then only an infantile existence; in fact, its waters to the south\r\nof the Hündsruck ridge drained away towards the south. But towards the\r\ncommencement of the Pliocene period the barriers of the Hündsruck and\r\nTaunus, as also that of the Linz, were broken through, and the course of\r\nthe waters was changed; and thus gradually, as the river deepened its\r\nbed, the waters were drained off from the great lakes.[2] This rupture\r\nof the barriers may have been due, in the first instance, to the\r\nterrestrial disturbances accompanying the volcanic eruptions of the\r\nEifel and Siebengebirge, though the erosion of the gorges at Bingen and\r\nat Linz to their present depth and dimensions is of course due to\r\nprolonged river action. It was about the epoch we have now arrived\r\nat--viz., the close of the Miocene--that volcanic action burst forth in\r\nthe region of the Lower Rhine. It is probable that this action commenced\r\nin the district of the Siebengebirge, and afterwards extended into that\r\nof the Moselle and the Eifel, the volcanoes of which bear evidence of\r\nrecent date. Layers of trachytic tuff are interstratified with the\r\ndeposits of sand, clay, and lignite of the formation known as that of\r\nthe Brown Coal--of Miocene age--which underlies nearly the whole of the\r\nvolcanic district on both sides of the Rhine near Bonn,[3] thus showing\r\nthat volcanic action had already commenced in that part to some extent;\r\nbut it does not appear from Dr. Hibbert's statement that any such\r\nfragments of eruptive rock are to be found in the strata which were\r\ndeposited over the floor of the Neuwied basin.[4] It will be recollected\r\nthat the epoch assigned for the earliest volcanic eruptions of Auvergne\r\nwas that here inferred for those of the Lower Rhine--viz., the close of\r\nthe Miocene stage--and from evidence subsequently to be adduced from\r\nother European districts, it will be found that there was a very widely\r\nspread outburst of volcanic action at this epoch.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _The Range of the Siebengebirge._--This range of hills--formed of\r\nthe older volcanic rocks of the Lower Rhine--rises along the right bank\r\nof this noble river opposite Bonn, where it leaves the narrow gorge\r\nwhich it traverses all the way from Bingen, and opens out on the broad\r\nplain of Northern Germany. The range consists of a succession of conical\r\nhills sometimes flat-topped--as in the case of Petersberg; and at the\r\nDrachenfels, near the centre of the range it presents to the river a\r\nbold front of precipitous cliffs of trachyte porphyry. The sketch (Fig.\r\n21) here presented was taken by the author in 1857 from the old extinct\r\nvolcano of Roderberg, and will convey, perhaps, a better idea of the\r\ncharacter of this picturesque range than a description. The\r\nSiebengebirge, although appearing as an isolated group of hills, is in\r\nreality an offshoot from the range of the Westerwald, which is connected\r\nwith another volcanic district of Central Germany known as the\r\nVogelsgebirge. The highest point in the range is attained in the\r\nLohrberg, which rises 1355 feet above the sea; the next, the Great\r\nTränkeberg, 1330 feet; and the next, Great Oelberg, 1296 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--The Volcanic Range of the Siebengebirge, seen\r\nfrom the left bank of the Rhine, above Bonn.--(Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe range consists mainly of trachytic rocks--namely,\r\ntrachyte-conglomerate, and solid trachyte, of which H. von Dechen makes\r\ntwo varieties--that of the Drachenfels, and that of the Wolkenburg. But\r\nassociated with these highly-silicated varieties of lava--and generally,\r\nif not always, of later date--are basaltic rocks which cap the hills of\r\nPetersberg, Nonnenstrom, Gr. and Ll. Oelberg, Gr. Weilberg, and Ober\r\nDollendorfer Hardt. The question whether there is a transition from the\r\none variety of volcanic rock into the other, or whether each belongs to\r\na distinct and separate epoch of eruption, does not seem to be very\r\nclearly determined. Mr. Leonard Horner states that it would be easy to\r\nform a suite of specimens showing a gradation from a white trachyte to a\r\nblack basalt;[5] but we must recollect that when Mr. Horner wrote, the\r\nmicroscopic examination of rocks by means of thin sections was not known\r\nor practised, and an examination by this process might have proved that\r\nthis apparent transition is unreal. According to H. von Dechen, there\r\nare sheets of basalt older than the greater mass of the brown coal\r\nformation, and others newer than the trachyte;[6] while dykes of basalt\r\ntraversing the trachytic lavas are not uncommon.[7]\r\n\r\nThe trachyte-conglomerate--which seems to be associated with the upper\r\nbeds of the brown coal strata--is traversed by dykes of trachyte of\r\nlater date; and though it is difficult to trace the line between the two\r\nvarieties of this rock on the ground, Dr. von Rath has recognised the\r\ngeneral distinction between them, which consists in the greater\r\nabundance of hornblende and mica in the trachyte of the Wolkenburg than\r\nin that of the Drachenfels.\r\n\r\nThe trachyte of the Drachenfels was probably the neck of a volcano which\r\nburst through the fundamental schists of the Devonian period. It is\r\nremarkable for the large crystals of sanidine (glassy felspar) which it\r\ncontains, and has a rude columnar structure.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any clearly-defined craters of eruption, such as are to\r\nbe found in the Eifel district and on the left bank of the Rhine--as,\r\nfor example, in the case of the Roderberg--may be regarded as sufficient\r\nevidence that this range is of comparatively high antiquity. It seems to\r\nbear the same relation to the more modern craters of the Eifel and\r\nMoselle that the Mont Dore and Cantal volcanoes do to those of the Puy\r\nde Dôme. In both cases, denudation carried on throughout perhaps the\r\nPliocene and Post-Pliocene periods down to the present day has had the\r\neffect of demolishing the original craters; so that what we now observe\r\nas forming these ranges are the consolidated columns of original molten\r\nmatter which filled the throats of the old volcanoes, or the sheets of\r\nlava which were extruded from them, but are now probably much reduced in\r\nsize and extent.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given a description of the older volcanic range on the right\r\nbank of the Rhine, we shall cross the river in search of some details\r\nregarding the more recent group of Rhenish volcanoes, commencing with\r\nthat of the Roderberg, a remarkable hill a few miles south of Bonn, from\r\nwhich the view of the Seven Mountains was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Section of the extinct crater of the Roderberg\r\non the bank of the Rhine, above Bonn.--(Original.)]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _The Roderberg._--This crater, which was visited by the author in\r\n1857, is about one-fourth of a mile in diameter, and is in the form of a\r\ncup with gentle slopes on all sides. In its centre is a farmhouse\r\nsurrounded by corn-fields. The general section through the hill is\r\nrepresented above (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\nThe flanks on the north side are composed of loose quartzose gravel\r\n(gerolle), a remnant of the deposits formed around the margin of the\r\n\"Basin of Neuwied\" described above (p. 114). This gravel is found\r\ncovering the terraces of the brown coal formation several hundred feet\r\nabove the Rhine. Besides quartz-pebbles, the deposit contains others of\r\nslate, grit, and volcanic rock. On reaching the edge of the crater we\r\nfind the gravel covered over by black and purple scoria or slag the\r\nsuperposition of the scoria on the gravel being visible in several\r\nplaces, showing that the former is of more recent origin. On the\r\nopposite side of the crater, overlooking the Rhine, we find the cliff of\r\nRolandsec composed of hard vesicular lava, rudely prismatic, and\r\nextending from the summit of the hill to its base, about 250 feet below.\r\nThis is the most northerly of the group of the Eifel volcanoes.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _District of the Rivers Brühl and Nette._--The volcanic region of\r\nthe Lower Eifel, drained by these two principal streams which flow into\r\nthe Rhine, will amply repay exploration by the student of volcanic\r\nphenomena, owing to the variety of forms and conditions under which\r\nthese present themselves within a small space. The fundamental rock is\r\nslate or grit of Devonian age, furrowed by numerous valleys, often\r\nrichly wooded, and diversified by conical hills of trachyte; or by\r\ncrater-cones, formed of basalt or ashes, sometimes ruptured on one side,\r\nand occasionally sending forth streams of lava, as in the cases of the\r\nPerlinkopf, the Bausenberg, and the Engelerkopf. The district attains\r\nits greatest altitude in the High Acht (Der Hohe Acht), an isolated cone\r\nof slate capped by basalt with olivine, and reaching a level of 2434\r\nRhenish feet.[8]\r\n\r\n(_f._) _The Laacher See._--It would be impossible in a work of this kind\r\nto attempt a detailed description of the Eifel volcanoes, often of a\r\nvery complex character and obscure physical history, as in the case of\r\nthe basin of Rieden, where tufaceous deposits, trachytic and basaltic\r\nlavas and crater-cones, are confusedly intermingled, so that I shall\r\nconfine my remarks to the deservedly famous district of the Laacher\r\nSee, which I had an opportunity of personally visiting some years\r\nsince.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Plan and Section of the Laacher See, a lake on\r\nthe borders of the Eifel, occupying the crater of an old volcano.--G.\r\nGravel and volcanic sand forming banks of the lake and rim of old\r\ncrater; L. Sheet of trachytic lava with columnar structure; B. Basaltic\r\ndyke; S. Devonian slate, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe Laacher See is a lake of an oval form, over an English mile in the\r\nshorter diameter, and surrounded by high banks of volcanic sand, gravel,\r\nand scoriæ, except on the east side, where cliffs of clay-slate, in a\r\nnearly vertical position, and striking nearly E.W., may be observed. Its\r\ndepth from the surface of the water is 214 feet.[10] The ashes of the\r\nencircling banks contain blocks of slate and lava which have been torn\r\nfrom the sides of the orifice or neck of the volcano and blown into the\r\nair; and there can be no doubt that the ashes and volcanic gravel is the\r\nresult of very recent eruptions.\r\n\r\nAt the east side of the lake we find a stream of scoriaceous lava of a\r\npurple or reddish colour, highly vesicular, and containing crystals of\r\nmica; but the most important lava-stream is that which has taken a\r\nsoutherly direction from the crater of the Laacher See towards Nieder\r\nMendig and Mayen, for a distance of about six miles. This great stream\r\nis covered throughout half its distance by beds of volcanic ash and\r\nlapilli, but emerges into the air at a distance of about two miles from\r\nthe edge of the crater (see Fig. 23), and was formerly extensively\r\nquarried in underground caverns for millstones. Here the rock is a\r\nvesicular trachyte, of a greyish colour, solidified in vertical columns\r\nof hexagonal form, about four feet in diameter, and traversed by\r\ntransverse joint planes. These quarries have been worked from the time\r\nof the Roman occupation of the country; and, before the introduction of\r\niron or steel rollers for grinding corn, millstones were exported to all\r\nparts of Europe and the British Isles from this quarry.[11]\r\n\r\nThe district around the Laacher See is covered by laminated _ejecta_ of\r\nthe old volcano, probably of subaërial origin, through which bosses of\r\nthe fundamental slate peer up at intervals, while the surface is\r\ndiversified by several truncated cones.\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Trass of the Brühl Valley._--The Brühl Valley, which unites\r\nwith that of the Rhine at the town of that name, and drains the northern\r\nside of the volcanic region, has always been regarded with much interest\r\nby travellers for the presence of a deposit of \"trass\" with which it is\r\npartially filled. The origin of this valley was pre-volcanic, as it is\r\nhewn out of the slaty rocks of the district. But at a later period it\r\nbecame filled with volcanic mud (tuffstein), out of which the stream has\r\nmade for itself a fresh channel. The source of this mud is considered by\r\nHibbert[12] to have been the old volcano of the Lummerfeld, which, after\r\nbecoming dormant, was filled with water, and thus became a lake. At a\r\nsubsequent period, however, a fresh eruption took place near the edge of\r\nthe lake, resulting in the remarkable ruptured crater known as the\r\nKunksköpfe, which rises about four miles to the north of the Laacher\r\nSee. The eruptions of this volcano appear to have displaced the mud of\r\nthe Lummerfeld, causing it to flow down into the deep gorge of the\r\nBrühl, which it completely filled, as stated above.\r\n\r\nOn walking down the valley one may sometimes see the junction of the\r\ntuff with the slate-rock which enfolds it. The tuff consists of white\r\nfelspathic mud, with fragments of slate and lava, reaching a depth in\r\nsome places of 150 feet. After it has been quarried it is ground in\r\nmills, and used for cement stone under the name of _trass_. It is said\r\nto resemble the volcanic mud by which Herculaneum was overwhelmed during\r\nthe first eruption of Vesuvius, and which was produced by the torrents\r\nof rain mixing with the ashes as they were blown out of the volcano.\r\n\r\nSufficient has probably now been written regarding the dormant, or\r\nrecently extinct, volcanic districts of Europe to give the reader a\r\nclear idea regarding their nature and physical structure. Other\r\ndistricts might be added, such as those of Central Germany, Hungary,\r\nTransylvania, and Styria; but to do so would be to exceed the proposed\r\nlimits of this work; and we may therefore pass on to the consideration\r\nof the volcanic region of Syria and Palestine, which adjoins the\r\nMediterranean district we have considered in a former page.\r\n\r\n[1] Daubeny, _loc. cit._, p. 71.

The specially volcanic region seems to be bounded by\r\nthe depression of the Jordan, the Dead Sea, and the Arabah as far south\r\nas the Gulf of Akabah; for, although Safed, lying at the head of the Sea\r\nof Galilee on the west of the Jordan valley, is built on a basaltic\r\nsheet, and is in proximity to an extinct crater, its position is\r\nexceptional to the general arrangement of the volcanic products which\r\nmay be traced at intervals from the base of Hermon into Central Arabia,\r\na distance of about 1000 miles.[1]\r\n\r\nThe tract referred to has been described at intervals by several\r\nauthors, of whom G. Schumacher,[2] L. Lartet,[3] Canon Tristram,[4] M.\r\nNiebuhr,[5] and C. M. Doughty[6] may be specially mentioned in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive manifestations of volcanic energy throughout this\r\nlong tract of country appear to be concentrated at its extreme limits.\r\nAt the northern extremity the generally wild and rugged tract of the\r\nJaulân and Haurân, called in the Bible _Trachonitis_, and still farther\r\nto the eastward the plateau of the Lejah, with its row of volcanic peaks\r\nsloping down to the vast level of Bashan, is covered throughout nearly\r\nits whole extent by great sheets of basaltic lava, above which rise at\r\nintervals, and in very perfect form, the old crater-cones of eruption. A\r\nsimilar group of extinct craters with lava-flows has been described and\r\nfigured by a recent traveller, Mr. C. M. Doughty, in parts of Central\r\nArabia. The general resemblance of these Arabian volcanoes to those of\r\nthe Jaulân is unquestionable; and as they are connected with each other\r\nby sheets of basaltic lava at intervals throughout the land of Moab, it\r\nis tolerably certain that the volcanoes lying at either end of the chain\r\nbelong to one system, and were contemporaneously in a state of activity.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Geological Conditions._--Before entering any further into\r\nparticulars regarding the volcanic phenomena of this region, it may be\r\ndesirable to give a short account of its geological structure, and the\r\nphysical conditions amongst which the igneous eruptions were developed.\r\n\r\nDown to the close of the Eocene period the whole region now under\r\nconsideration was occupied by the waters of the ocean. The mountains of\r\nSinai were islands in this ocean, which had a very wide range over parts\r\nof Asia, Africa, and Europe. But at the commencement of the succeeding\r\nMiocene stage the crust was subjected to lateral contraction, owing to\r\nwhich the ocean bed was upraised. The strata were flexured, folded, and\r\noften faulted and fissured along lines ranging north and south, the\r\ngreat fault of the Jordan-Arabah valley being the most important. At\r\nthis period the mountains of the Lebanon, the table-lands of Judæa and\r\nof Arabia, formed of limestone, previously constituting the bed of the\r\nocean during the Eocene and Cretaceous periods, were converted into land\r\nsurfaces. Along with this upheaval of the sea-bed there was extensive\r\ndenudation and erosion of the strata, so that valleys were eroded over\r\nthe subaërial tracts, and the Jordan-Arabah valley received its primary\r\nform and outline.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there does not appear to have been any outbreak of\r\nvolcanic forces; but with the succeeding Pliocene period these came into\r\nplay, and eruptions of basaltic lava took place along rents and fissures\r\nin the strata, while craters and cones of slag, scoriæ, and ashes were\r\nthrown up over the region lying to the east of the Sea of Galilee and\r\nthe sources of the Jordan on the one hand, and the central parts of the\r\ngreat Arabian Desert on the other. These eruptions, probably\r\nintermittent, continued into the succeeding Glacial or Pluvial period,\r\nand only died out about the time that the earliest inhabitants appeared\r\non the scene.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _The Jaulân and Haurân._--This tract is bounded by the valley of\r\nthe Jordan and the Sea of Galilee on the west, from which it rises by\r\nsteep and rocky declivities into an elevated table-land, drained by the\r\nYarmûk (Hieromax), the Nahr er Rukkâd, and other streams, which flow\r\nwestwards into the Jordan along deep channels in which the basaltic\r\nsheets and underlying limestone strata are well laid open to view.\r\n\r\nOn consideration it seems improbable that the great sheets of augitic\r\nlava, such as cover the surface of the land of Bashan, are altogether\r\nthe product of the volcanic mountains which appear to be confined to\r\nspecial districts in this wide area. Some of the craters do indeed send\r\nforth visible lava-streams, but they are insignificant as compared with\r\nthe general mass of the plateau-basalts; and the crater-cones themselves\r\nappear in some cases to be posterior to the platforms of basalt from\r\nwhich they rise. It is very probable, therefore, that the lavas of this\r\nregion have, in the main, been extruded from fissures of eruption at an\r\nearly period, and spread over the surface of the country in the same\r\nmanner as those of the Snake River region, and the borders of the\r\nPacific Ocean of North America, and possibly of the Antrim Plateau in\r\nIreland, afterwards to be described.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic hills which rise above the plateau are described in detail\r\nby Schumacher. Of these, Tell Abû Nedîr is the largest in the Jaulân. It\r\nreaches an elevation of 4132 feet above the Mediterranean Sea, and 1710\r\nfeet above the plain from which it rises; the circumference of its base\r\nis three miles, and the rim of the crater itself, which is oval in form,\r\nis 1331 yards in its larger diameter. The interior is cultivated by\r\nCircassians, and is very fruitful; the walls descend at an angle of\r\nabout 30° on the inside, the exterior slope of the mountain being about\r\n22°. The cone seems to be formed chiefly of scoriæ, and the lava-stream,\r\nwhich issues forth from the interior, forms a frightfully stony and\r\nlacerated district.[7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Extinct Craters in the Jaulân, north-east from\r\nthe Sea of Galilee, called Tell Abû en Nedâ and Tell el Urâm, with a\r\ncentral cone.--(After Schumacher.)]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable volcano is the Tell Abû en Nedâ (Fig. 24). This is a\r\ndouble crater, with a cone (probably of cinders) rising from the\r\ninterior of one of them. The highest point of the rim of one of the\r\ncraters reaches a level of 4042 feet above the sea. A lava-stream issues\r\nforth from Abû en Nedâ, and unites with another from a neighbouring\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nTell el Ahmâr is a ruptured crater of imposing aspect, reaching an\r\nelevation of 4060 feet, and sending forth a lava-current, which falls in\r\nregular terraces from the outlet towards the west and north.\r\n\r\nThe ruptured crater of Tell el Akkasheh, which reaches a height of 3400\r\nfeet, has a less forbidding aspect than the greater number of the\r\nextinct volcanoes of this region, owing to the fact that its sides are\r\ncovered by oaks, which attain to magnificent proportions along the\r\nsummit. Numerous other volcanic hills occur in this district, but the\r\nmost remarkable is that called Tell el Farras (the Hill of the Horse).\r\nIt is an isolated mountain, visible from afar, and reaches an elevation\r\nof 3110 feet, or nearly 800 feet above the surrounding plain. The oval\r\ncrater of this volcano opens towards the north, and has a depth of 108\r\nfeet below the edge, with moderately steep sloping sides (17°-32°),\r\nwhile the slope of the exterior, at first steep, gradually lessens to\r\n20°-21°. These slopes are covered with reddish or yellowish slag. The\r\nabove examples will probably suffice to afford the reader a general idea\r\nof the size and form of the volcanoes in this little known region.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that the great lava-floods have probably been\r\npoured forth intermittently. The statement receives confirmation from\r\nthe observations of Canon Tristram, made in the valley of the Yarmûk.[8]\r\nThis impetuous torrent rushes down a gorge, sometimes having limestone\r\non one side and a wall of basalt on the other. This is due to the fact\r\nthat the river channel had been eroded before the volcanic eruptions had\r\ncommenced; but on the lava-stream reaching the channel, it naturally\r\ndescended towards the valley of the Jordan along its bed, displacing the\r\nriver, or converting it into clouds of steam. Subsequently the river\r\nagain hewed out its channel, sometimes in the lava, sometimes between\r\nthis rock and the chalky limestone. But, in addition to this, it has\r\nbeen observed that there is a bed of river gravel interposed between two\r\nsheets of basalt in the Yarmûk ravine; showing that after the first flow\r\nof that molten rock the river reoccupied its channel, which was\r\nafterwards invaded by another molten lava-stream, into which the waters\r\nhave again furrowed the channel which they now occupy. The basaltic\r\nsheets descend under the waters of the Sea of Galilee on the east side,\r\nand were probably connected with those of Safed, crossing the Jordan\r\nvalley north of that lake; owing to this the waters of the Lake of Merom\r\n(Huleh) were pent up, and formerly covered an extensive tract, now\r\nformed of alluvial deposits.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Land of Moab._--Proceeding southwards into the Land of Moab, the\r\nvolcanic phenomena are here of great interest. Extensive sheets of\r\nbasaltic lava, described as far back as 1807 by Seetzen, and more\r\nrecently by Lartet and Tristram, are found at intervals between the\r\nWâdies Mojib (Arnon) and Haidan. On either side of the Mojib, cliffs of\r\ncolumnar basalt are seen capping the beds of white Cretaceous limestone,\r\nwhile a large mass has descended into the W. Haidan between cliffs of\r\nlimestone and marl on either hand.\r\n\r\nAround Jebel Attarus--a dome-shaped hill of limestone--a sheet of\r\nbasaltic lava has been poured, and has descended the deep gorge of the\r\nZerka Maïn, which enters the Dead Sea some 2000 feet below. This gorge\r\nhad been eroded before the basaltic eruption, so that the stream of\r\nmolten lava took its course down the bed of this stream to the water's\r\nedge, and grand sections have been laid bare by subsequent erosion along\r\nthe banks. Pentagonal columns of black basalt form perpendicular walls,\r\nfirst on one side, then on the other; while considerable masses of\r\nscoriæ, peperino, and breccia appear at the head of the glen, probably\r\nmarking the orifice of eruption. Other eruptions of basalt occur, one at\r\nMountar ez Zara, to the south of Zerka Maïn, and another at Wady\r\nGhuweir, near the north-eastern end of the Dead Sea. There are no\r\nlava-streams on the western side of the Ghor, or of the Dead Sea.[9]\r\n\r\nThe outburst of the celebrated thermal springs of Callirrhoë, together\r\nwith nine or ten others, along the channel of the Zerka Maïn, is a\r\ncircumstance which cannot be dissociated from the occurrence of basaltic\r\nlava at this spot. In a reach of three miles, according to Tristram,\r\nthere are ten principal springs, of which the fifth in descent is the\r\nlargest; but the seventh and eighth, about half a mile lower down, are\r\nthe most remarkable, giving forth large supplies of sulphurous water.\r\nThe tenth and last is the hottest of all, indicating a temperature of\r\n143° Fahr. Thus it would appear that the heat increases with the depth\r\nfrom the upper surface of the table-land; a result which might be\r\nexpected, supposing the heated volcanic rocks to be themselves the\r\nsource of the high temperature. To a similar cause may be attributed the\r\nhot-springs of Hammath, near Tiberias, and those of the Yarmûk near its\r\nconfluence with the Jordan. Some of these and other springs break out\r\nalong, or near, the line of the great Jordan-Arabah fault which ranges\r\nthroughout the whole extent of this depression, from the base of Hermon\r\nto the Gulf of Akabah, generally keeping close to the eastern margin of\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _The Arabian Desert._--The basaltic lava-floods occupy a very\r\nlarge extent of the Arabian Desert, from El Hisma (lat. 27° 35' N.) to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mecca on the south, a distance of about 440 miles,\r\nwith occasional intervals. The lava-sheets are called \"Harras\" (or\r\n\"Harrat\"), one of which, Harrat Sfeina, terminates about ten miles north\r\nof Mecca. The lava-sheets rest sometimes on the red sandstone, at other\r\ntimes, on the granite and other crystalline rocks of great geological\r\nantiquity. In addition to the sheets of basalt, numerous crater-cones\r\nrise from the basaltic platform at a level of 5000 feet above the sea,\r\nand two volcanic mountains, rising far to the west of the principal\r\nrange, called respectively Harrât Jeheyma and H. Rodwa, almost overlook\r\nthe coast of the Red Sea.[10]\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Age of the Volcanic Eruptions._--It is very clear that the first\r\neruptions, producing the great basaltic sheets of Moab and Arabia,\r\noccurred after the principal features of the country had been developed.\r\nThe depression of the Jordan-Arabah valley, the elevation of the eastern\r\nside of this valley along the great fault line, and the channels of the\r\nprincipal tributary streams, such as those of the Yarmûk and Zerka Maïn,\r\nall these had been eroded out before they were invaded by the molten\r\nstreams of lava. Now, as these physical features were developed and\r\nsculptured out during the Miocene period, as I have elsewhere shown to\r\nbe the case,[11] we may with great probability refer the volcanic\r\neruptions to the geological epoch following--namely, the Pliocene. How\r\nfar downwards towards the historic period the eruptions continued is not\r\nso certain. Dr. Daubeny, quoting several passages from the Old Testament\r\nprophets,[12] says it might be inferred that volcanoes were in activity\r\neven so late as to admit of their being included within the limits of\r\nauthentic history. The poetic language and imagery used in these\r\npassages by the prophets certainly lends a probability to this view, but\r\nnothing more. On the other hand, these regions have suffered through\r\nmany centuries from the secondary effects of seismic action and\r\nsubterranean forces, and earthquake shocks have laid in ruins the great\r\ntemples and palaces of Palmyra, Baalbec, and other cities of antiquity.\r\nThe same uncertainty regarding the time at which volcanic action died\r\nout, with reference to the appearance of man on the scene, hangs over\r\nthe region of Arabia and Syria, as we have seen to be the case in\r\nreference to the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, the Eifel, and the Lower\r\nRhine. In all these cases the commencement and close of eruptive action\r\nappear to have been very much about the same period--namely, the Miocene\r\nperiod on the one hand, and that at which man entered upon the scene on\r\nthe other; but in the case of Syria and Western Palestine, the close of\r\nthe volcanic period may have been somewhat more than 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n[1] Lake Phiala, near the Lake of Huleh, is also situated to the west of\r\nthe Jordan valley. Its origin, according to Tristram, is volcanic.\r\n\r\n[2] Schumacher, \"The Jaulân,\" _Quarterly Statement of the Palestine\r\nExploration Fund_, 1886 and 1888; and _Across the Jordan_, London, 1886.\r\n\r\n[3] Lartet, _Voyage d'Exploration de la mer Morte_ (Géologie), Paris,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n[4] Tristram, _Land of Moab_, London, 1873; and _Land of Israel_, 1866.\r\n\r\n[5] Niebuhr, _Beschreibung von Arabien_, 1773.\r\n\r\n[6] C.

The great\r\nvalley of the Mississippi and its tributaries forms the dividing\r\nterritory between the volcanic and non-volcanic areas; so that on\r\ncrossing the high ridges in which the western tributaries of America's\r\ngreatest river have their sources, and to which the name of the \"Rocky\r\nMountains\" more properly belongs, we find ourselves in a region which,\r\nthroughout the later Tertiary times down almost to the present day, has\r\nbeen the scene of volcanic operations on the grandest scale; where\r\nlava-floods have been poured over the country through thousands of\r\nsquare miles, and where volcanic cones, vying in magnitude with those of\r\nEtna, Vesuvius, or Hecla, have established themselves. This region,\r\ngenerally known as \"The Great Basin,\" is bounded on the west by the\r\n\"Pacific Range\" of mountains, and includes portions of New Mexico,\r\nArizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming,\r\nMontana, and Washington. To the south it passes into the mountainous\r\nregion of Mexico, also highly volcanic; and thence into the ridge of\r\nPanama and the Andes. It cannot be questioned but that the volcanic\r\nnature of the Great Basin is due to the same causes which have\r\noriginated the volcanic outbursts of the Andes; but, from whatever\r\ncause, the volcanic forces have here entered upon their secondary or\r\nmoribund stage. In the Yellowstone Valley, geysers, hot springs, and\r\nfumaroles give evidence of this condition. In other districts the\r\nlava-streams are so fresh and unweathered as to suggest that they had\r\nbeen erupted only a few hundred years ago; but no active vent or crater\r\nis to be found over the whole of this wide region. A few special\r\ndistricts only can here be selected by way of illustration of its\r\nspecial features in connection with its volcanic history.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _The Plateau Country of Utah and Arizona._--This tract, which is\r\ndrained by the Colorado River and its tributaries, is bounded on the\r\nnorth by the Wahsatch range, and extends eastwards to the base of the\r\nSierra Nevada. Round its margin extensive volcanic tracts are to be\r\nfound, with numerous peaks and truncated cones--the ancient craters of\r\neruption--of which Mount San Francisco is the culminating eminence.\r\nSouth of the Wahsatch, and occupying the high plateaux of Utah, enormous\r\nmasses of volcanic products have been spread over an area of 9000 square\r\nmiles, attaining a thickness of between 3000 and 4000 feet. The earlier\r\nof these great lava-floods appear to have been trachytic, but the later\r\nbasaltic; and in the opinion of Captain Dutton, who has described them,\r\nthey range in point of time from the Middle Tertiary (Miocene) down to\r\ncomparatively recent times.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _The Grand Cañon._--To the south of the high plateaux of Utah\r\nare many minor volcanic mountains, now extinct; and as we descend\r\ntowards the Grand Cañon of Colorado we find numerous cinder-cones\r\nscattered about at intervals near the cliffs.[1] Extensive lava-fields,\r\nsurmounted by cinder-cones, occupy the plateau on the western side of\r\nthe Grand Cañon; and, according to Dutton, the great sheets of basaltic\r\nlava, of very recent age, which occupy many hundred square miles of\r\ndesert, have had their sources in these cones of eruption.[2] Crossing\r\nto the east of the Grand Cañon, we find other lava-floods poured over\r\nthe country at intervals, surmounted by San Francisco--a volcanic\r\nmountain of the first magnitude--which reaches an elevation, according\r\nto Wheeler, of 12,562 feet above the ocean. It has long been extinct,\r\nand its summit and flanks are covered with snow-fields and glaciers.\r\nOther parts of Arizona are overspread by sheets of basaltic lava,\r\nthrough which old \"necks\" of eruption, formed of more solid lava than\r\nthe sheets, rise occasionally above the surface, and are prominent\r\nfeatures in the landscape.\r\n\r\nFurther to the eastward in New Mexico, and near the margin of the\r\nvolcanic region, is another volcanic mountain little less lofty than San\r\nFrancisco, called Mount Taylor, which, according to Dutton, rises to an\r\nelevation of 11,390 feet above the ocean, and 8200 feet above the\r\ngeneral level of the surrounding plateau of lava. This mountain forms\r\nthe culminating point of a wide volcanic tract, over which are\r\ndistributed numberless vents of eruption. Scores of such\r\nvents--generally cinder-cones--are visible in every part of the plateau,\r\nand always in a more or less dilapidated condition.[3] Mount Taylor is a\r\nvolcano, with a central pipe terminating in a large crater, the wall of\r\nwhich was broken down on the east side in the later stage of its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Mount Shasta (14,511 feet), a snow-clad\r\nvolcanic cone in California, with Mount Shastina, a secondary crater, on\r\nthe right; the valley between is filled with glacier-ice.--(After\r\nDutton).]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _California._--Proceeding westwards into California, we are\r\nagain confronted with volcanic phenomena on a stupendous scale. The\r\ncoast range of mountains, which branches off from the Sierra Nevada at\r\nMount Pinos, on the south, is terminated near the northern extremity of\r\nthe State by a very lofty mountain of volcanic origin, called Mount\r\nShasta, which attains an elevation of 14,511 feet (see Fig. 25). This\r\nmountain was first ascended by Clarence King in 1870,[4] and although\r\nforming, as it were, a portion of the Pacific Coast Range, it really\r\nrises from the plain in solitary grandeur, its summit covered by snow,\r\nand originating several fine glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe summit of Mount Shasta is a nearly perfect cone, but from its\r\nnorth-west side there juts out a large crater-cone just below the\r\nsnow-line, between which and the main mass of the mountain there exists\r\na deep depression filled with glacier ice. This secondary crater-cone\r\nhas been named Mount Shastina, and round its inner side the stream of\r\nglacier ice winds itself, sometimes surmounting the rim of the crater,\r\nand shooting down masses of ice into the great caldron. The length of\r\nthis glacier is about three miles, and its breadth about 4000 feet.\r\nAnother very lofty volcanic mountain is Mount Rainier, in the Washington\r\nterritory, consisting of three peaks of which the eastern possesses a\r\ncrater very perfect throughout its entire circumference. This mountain\r\nappears to be formed mainly of trachytic matter. Proceeding further\r\nnorth into British territory, several volcanic mountains near the\r\nPacific Coast are said to exhibit evidence of activity. Of these may be\r\nmentioned Mount Edgecombe, in lat. 57°.3; Mount Fairweather, lat. 57°.20\r\nwhich rises to a height of 14,932 feet; and Mount St. Elias, lat. 60°.5,\r\njust within the divisional line between British and Russian territory,\r\nand reaching an altitude of 16,860 feet. This, the loftiest of all the\r\nvolcanoes of the North American continent, except those of Mexico, may\r\nbe considered as the connecting link in the volcanic chain between the\r\ncontinent and the Aleutian Islands.[5]\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Lake Bonneville._--Returning to Utah we are brought into contact\r\nwith phenomena of special interest, owing to the inter-relations of\r\nvolcanic and lacustrine conditions which once prevailed over large\r\ntracts of that territory. The present Great Salt Lake, and the smaller\r\nneighbouring lakes, those called Utah and Sevier, are but remnants of an\r\noriginally far greater expanse of inland water, the boundaries of which\r\nhave been traced out by Mr. C. K. Gilbert, and described under the name\r\nof Lake Bonneville.[6] The waters of this lake appear to have reached\r\ntheir highest level at the period of maximum cold of the Post-Pliocene\r\nperiod, when the glaciers descended to its margin, and large streams of\r\nglacier water were poured into it. Eruptions of basaltic lava from\r\nsuccessive craters appear to have gone on before, during, and after the\r\nlacustrine epochs; and the drying up of the waters over the greater\r\nextent of their original area, now converted into the Sevier Desert, and\r\ntheir concentration into their present comparatively narrow basins,\r\nappears to have proceeded _pari passu_ with the gradual extinction of\r\nthe volcanic outbursts. Two successive epochs of eruption of basalt\r\nappear to have been clearly established--an earlier one of the \"Provo\r\nAge,\" when the lava was extruded from the Tabernacle craters, and a\r\nlater epoch, when the eruptions took place from the Ice Spring craters.\r\nThe oldest volcanic rock appears to be rhyolite, which peers up in two\r\nsmall hills almost smothered beneath the lake deposits. Its eruption was\r\nlong anterior to the lake period. On the other hand, the cessation of\r\nthe eruptions of the later basaltic sheets is evidently an event of such\r\nrecent date that Mr. Gilbert is led to look forward to their resumption\r\nat some future, but not distant, epoch. As he truly observes, we are not\r\nto infer that, because the outward manifestations of volcanic action\r\nhave ceased, the internal causes of those manifestations have passed\r\naway. These are still in operation, and must make themselves felt when\r\nthe internal forces have recovered their exhausted energies; but perhaps\r\nnot to the same extent as before.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Region of the Snake River._--The tract of country bordering the\r\nSnake River in Idaho and Washington is remarkable for the vast sheets of\r\nplateau-basalt with which it is overspread, extending sometimes in one\r\ngreat flood farther than the eye can reach, and what is still more\r\nremarkable, they are often unaccompanied by any visible craters or vents\r\nof eruption. In Oregon the plateau-basalt is at least 2,000 feet in\r\nthickness, and where traversed by the Columbia River it reaches a\r\nthickness of about 3,000 feet. The Snake and Columbia rivers are lined\r\nby walls of volcanic rock, basaltic above, trachytic below, for a\r\ndistance of, in the former, one hundred, in the latter, two hundred,\r\nmiles. Captain Dutton, in describing the High Plateau of Utah, observes\r\nthat the lavas appear to have welled up in mighty floods without any of\r\nthat explosive violence generally characteristic of volcanic action.\r\nThis extravasated matter has spread over wide fields, deluging the\r\nsurrounding country like a tide in a bay, and overflowing all\r\ninequalities. Here also we have evidence of older volcanic cones buried\r\nbeneath seas of lava subsequently extruded.\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Fissures of Eruption._--The absence, or rarity, of volcanic\r\ncraters or cones of eruption in the neighbourhood of these great sheets\r\nhas led American geologists to the conclusion that the lavas were in\r\nmany cases extruded from fissures in the earth's crust rather than from\r\nordinary craters.[7] This view is also urged by Sir A. Geikie, who\r\nvisited the Utah region of the Snake River in 1880, and has vividly\r\ndescribed the impression produced by the sight of these vast fields of\r\nbasaltic lava. He says, \"We found that the older trachytic lavas of the\r\nhills had been deeply trenched by the lateral valleys, and that all\r\nthese valleys had a floor of black basalt that had been poured out as\r\nthe last of the molten materials from the now extinct volcanoes. There\r\nwere no visible cones or vents from which these floods of basalt could\r\nhave proceeded. We rode for hours by the margin of a vast plain of\r\nbasalt stretching southward and westward as far as the eye could\r\nreach.... I realised the truth of an assertion made first by\r\nRichthofen,[8] that our modern volcanoes, such as Vesuvius and Etna,\r\npresent us with by no means the grandest type of volcanic action, but\r\nrather belong to a time of failing activity. There have been periods of\r\ntremendous volcanic energy, when instead of escaping from a local vent,\r\nlike a Vesuvian cone, the lava has found its way to the surface by\r\ninnumerable fissures opened for it in the solid crust of the globe over\r\nthousands of square miles.\"[9]\r\n\r\n(_h._) _Volcanic History of Western America._--The general succession of\r\nvolcanic events throughout the region of Western America appears to have\r\nbeen somewhat as follows:--[10]\r\n\r\nThe earliest volcanic eruptions occurred in the later Eocene epoch and\r\nwere continued into the succeeding Miocene stage. These consisted of\r\nrocks moderately rich in silica, and are grouped under the heads of\r\npropylite and andesite. To these succeeded during the Pliocene epoch\r\nstill more highly silicated rocks of trachytic type, consisting of\r\nsanidine and oligoclase trachytes. Then came eruptions of rhyolite\r\nduring the later Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs; and lastly, after a\r\nperiod of cessation, during which the rocks just described were greatly\r\neroded, came the great eruptions of basaltic lava, deluging the plains,\r\nwinding round the cones or plateaux of the older lavas, descending into\r\nthe river valleys and flooding the lake beds, issuing forth from both\r\nvents and fissures, and continuing intermittently down almost into the\r\npresent day--certainly into the period of man's appearance on the scene.\r\nThus the volcanic history of Western America corresponds remarkably to\r\nthat of the European regions with which we have previously dealt, both\r\nas regards the succession of the various lavas and the epochs of their\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n(_i._) _The Yellowstone Park._--The geysers and hot springs of the\r\nYellowstone Park, like those in Iceland and New Zealand, are special\r\nmanifestations of volcanic action, generally in its secondary or\r\nmoribund stage. The geysers of the Yellowstone occur on a grand scale;\r\nthe eruptions are frequent, and the water is projected into the air to a\r\nheight of over 200 feet. Most of these are intermittent, like the\r\nremarkable one known as Old Faithful, the Castle Geyser, and the\r\nGiantess Geyser described by Dr. Hayden, which ejects the water to a\r\nheight of 250 feet. The geyser-waters hold large quantities of silica\r\nand sulphur in solution, owing to their high temperature under great\r\npressure, and these minerals are precipitated upon the cooling of the\r\nwaters in the air, and form circular basins, often gorgeously tinted\r\nwith red and yellow colours.[11]\r\n\r\n[1] J. W. Powell, _Exploration of the Cañons of the Colorado_, pp. 114,\r\n196. Major Powell describes a fault or fissure through which floods of\r\nlava have been forced up from beneath and have been poured over the\r\nsurface. Many cinder-cones are planted along the line of this fissure.\r\n\r\n[2] Capt. C. E. Dutton. _Sixth Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol.

New Zealand is an\r\nisland wherein seem to be concentrated all the phenomena of volcanic\r\naction of past and present time. Though it is doubtful if the term\r\n\"active,\" in its full sense, can be applied to any of the existing\r\ncraters (with two or three exceptions, such as Tongariro and Whakari\r\nIsland), we find craters and cones in great numbers in perfectly fresh\r\ncondition, extensive sheets of trachytic and basaltic lavas, ashes, and\r\nagglomerates; lava-floods descending from the ruptured craters of ashes\r\nand scoriæ; old crater-basins converted into lakes; geysers, hot springs\r\nand fumaroles which may be counted by hundreds, and cataracts breaking\r\nover barriers of siliceous sinter; and, lastly, lofty volcanic mountains\r\nvying in magnitude with Vesuvius and Etna. All these wonderful\r\nexhibitions of moribund volcanic action seem to be concentrated in the\r\nnorthern island of Auckland. The southern island, which is the larger,\r\nalso has its natural attractions, but they are of a different kind;\r\nchief of all is the grand range of mountains called, not\r\ninappropriately, the \"Southern Alps,\" vying with its European\r\nrepresentative in the loftiness of its peaks and the splendour of its\r\nsnowfields and glaciers, but formed of more ancient and solid rocks than\r\nthose of the northern island.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Auckland District._--We are indebted to several naturalists for\r\nour knowledge of the volcanic regions of New Zealand, but chiefly to\r\nFerdinand von Hochstetter, whose beautiful maps and graphic descriptions\r\nleave nothing to be desired.[1] In this work Hochstetter was assisted by\r\nJulius Haast and Sir J. Hector. From their account we learn that the\r\nIsthmus of Auckland is one of the most remarkable volcanic districts in\r\nthe world. It is characterised by a large number of extinct\r\ncinder-cones, in a greater or less perfect state of preservation, and\r\ngiving origin to lava-streams which have poured down the sides of the\r\nhills on to the plains. Besides these are others formed of stratified\r\ntuff, with interior craters, surrounding in mural cliffs eruptive cones\r\nof scoriæ, ashes, and lapilli; these cones are scattered over the\r\nisthmus and shores of Waitemata and Manukau. The tuff cones and craters\r\nrise from a floor of Tertiary sandstone and shale, the horizontal strata\r\nof which are laid open in the precipitous bluffs of Waitemata and\r\nManukau harbours; they sometimes contain fossil shells of the genera\r\n_Pecten_, _Nucula_, _Cardium_, _Turbo_, and _Neritæ_. As the volcanic\r\ntuff-beds are intermingled with the Upper Tertiary strata, it is\r\ninferred that the first outbursts of volcanic forces occurred when the\r\nregion was still beneath the waters of the ocean. Cross-sections show\r\nthat the different layers slope both outwards (parallel to the sides)\r\nand inwards towards the bottom of the craters. Sometimes these craters\r\nhave been converted into lakes, as in the case of those of the Eifel;\r\nbut generally they are dry or have a floor of morass. Of the\r\ncrater-lakes, those of Kohuora, five in number, are perhaps the most\r\nremarkable; and in the case of two of these the central cones of slag\r\nappear as islets rising from the surface of the waters. The fresh-water\r\nlake Pupuka has a depth of twenty-eight fathoms. To the north of\r\nAuckland Harbour rises out of the waters of the Hauraki Gulf the cone of\r\nRangitoto, 920 feet high, the flanks formed of rugged streams of basalt,\r\nand the summit crowned by a circular crater of slag and ash, out of the\r\ncentre of which rises a second cone with the vent of eruption. This is\r\nthe largest and newest of the Auckland volcanoes, and appears to have\r\nbeen built up by successive outpourings of basaltic lava from the\r\ncentral orifice, after the general elevation of the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Forms of volcanic tuff cones, with their\r\ncross-sections, in the Province of Auckland.--No. 1. Simple tuff cone\r\nwith central crater; No. 2. Outer tuff cone with interior cinder cone\r\nand crater; No. 3. The same with lava-stream issuing from the interior\r\ncone.--(After Hochstetter.)]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the description of the tuff-cones, which are a peculiar\r\nfeature in the volcanic phenomena of New Zealand, and are of many forms\r\nand varieties, we must refer to that of Mount Wellington (Maunga Rei).\r\nThis is a compound volcano, in which the oldest and smallest of the\r\ngroup is a tuff-crater-cone, exhibiting very beautifully the outward\r\nslope of its beds. Within this crater arise two cones of cinders, each\r\nwith small craters. It would appear that after a long interval the\r\nlarger of the two principal cones, formed of cinders and known as Mount\r\nWellington, burst forth from the southern margin of the older tuff-cone,\r\nand, being built up to a height of 850 feet, gradually overspread the\r\nsides of its older neighbour. Mount Wellington itself has three craters,\r\nand from these large streams of basaltic lava have issued forth in a\r\nwesterly direction, while a branch entered and partially filled the old\r\ntuff-crater to the northwards.\r\n\r\nSouthwards from Manukau Harbour, and extending a short distance from\r\nthe coast-line to Taranaki Point, there occurs a plateau of\r\nbasalt-conglomerate (_Basaltkonglomerat_), with sheets of basaltic lava\r\noverspreading the Tertiary strata. These plateau-basalts are intersected\r\nby eruptive masses in the form of dykes, but still there are no craters\r\nor cones of eruption to be seen; so that we may infer that the sheets,\r\nat least, were extruded from fissures in the manner of those of the\r\nColorado or Idaho regions of America. Proceeding still further south\r\ninto the interior of the island, we here find a lofty plateau of an\r\naverage elevation of 2,000 feet, interposed between the Tertiary beds of\r\nthe Upper and Middle Waikato, and formed of trachytic and pitch-stone\r\ntuff, amongst which arise old extinct volcanic cones, such as those of\r\nKarioi, Pirongia, Kakepuku, Maunga Tautari, Aroha, and many others.\r\nThese trachytic lavas would seem to be more ancient than the basaltic,\r\npreviously described.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Taupo Lake, and surrounding district._--But of all these\r\nvolcanic districts, none is more remarkable than that surrounding the\r\nTaupo Lake, which lies amidst the Tertiary strata of the Upper Waikato\r\nBasin. The surface of this lake is 1,250 feet above that of the ocean,\r\nand its margin is enclosed within a border of rhyolite and\r\npitchstone--rising into a mass of the same material 1,800 feet high on\r\nthe eastern side. The form of the lake does not suggest that it is\r\nitself the crater of a volcano, but rather that it was originated by\r\nsubsidence. On all sides, however, trachytic cones arise, of which the\r\nmost remarkable group lies to the south of the lake, just in front of\r\nthe two giant trachytic cones, the loftiest in New Zealand, one called\r\nTongariro, rising about 6,500 feet, and the other Ruapahu, which attains\r\nan elevation of over 9,000 feet, with the summit capped by snow. These\r\ntwo lofty cones, standing side by side, are supposed by the Maoris to be\r\nthe husband and wife to whom were born the group of smaller cones above\r\nreferred to as occupying the southern shore of Taupo Lake. The volcano\r\nof Tongariro may still be considered as in a state of activity, as its\r\ntwo craters (Ngauruhoe and Ketetahi) constantly emit steam, and several\r\nsolfataras break out on its flanks.[2]\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Roto Mahana._--In a northerly direction from Tongariro, and\r\ndistant from the coast by a few miles, lies in the Bay of Plenty the\r\nsecond of the active volcanoes of New Zealand, the volcanic island of\r\nWhakari (White Island), from the crater of which are constantly erupted\r\nvast masses of steam clouds. The distance between these two active\r\ncraters is 120 nautical miles; and along the tract joining them\r\nsteam-jets and geysers issue forth from the deep fissures through which\r\nthe lava sheets have formerly been extruded. Numerous lakes also occupy\r\nthe larger cavities in the ground; and hot-springs, steam-fumaroles and\r\nsolfataras burst out in great numbers along the banks of the Roto Mahana\r\nLake and the Kaiwaka River by which it is drained. Amongst such\r\neruptions of hot-water and steam we might expect the formation of\r\nsiliceous sinter, and the deposition of sulphur and other minerals; nor\r\nwill our expectations be disappointed. For here we have the wonderful\r\nterraces of siliceous sinter deposited by the waters entering Roto\r\nMahana as they descend from the numerous hot-springs or pools near its\r\nmargin. All travellers concur in describing these terraces as the most\r\nwonderful of all the wonders of the Lake district of New Zealand--so\r\ngreat is their extent, and so rich and varied is their colouring.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful map of Roto Mahana on an enlarged scale by Hochstetter\r\nshows no fewer than ten large sinter terraces descending towards the\r\nmargin of this lake, besides several mud-springs, fumaroles, and\r\nsolfataras. But the largest and most celebrated of all the sinter\r\nterraces has within the last few years been buried from view beneath a\r\nflood of volcanic trass, or mud, an event which was as unexpected as it\r\nwas unwelcome. In May, 1887, the mountain of Tarawera, which rises to\r\nthe north-east of Roto Mahana, and on the line of eruption above\r\ndescribed, suddenly burst forth into violent activity, covering the\r\ncountry for miles around with clouds of ashes, and, pouring down\r\ntorrents of mud, completely enveloped the beautiful terrace of sinter\r\nwhich had previously been one of the wonders of New Zealand. By the same\r\neruption several human beings were entombed, and their residences\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Roto Mahana, together with the hot-springs and fountains\r\nare fed from rain, and from the waters of Taupo Lake, which, sinking\r\nthrough fissures in the ground, come in contact with the interior heated\r\nmatter, and thus steam at high temperature and pressure is generated.[3]\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Moribund condition of New Zealand Volcanoes._--From what has\r\nbeen said, it will be inferred that in the case of New Zealand, as in\r\nthose of Auvergne, the Eifel and Lower Rhine, Arabia, and Western\r\nAmerica, we have an example of a region wherein the volcanic forces are\r\nwell-nigh spent, but in which they were in a state of extraordinary\r\nactivity throughout the later Tertiary, down to the commencement of the\r\npresent epoch. In most of these cases the secondary phenomena of\r\nvulcanicity are abundantly manifest; but the great exhibitions of\r\nigneous action, when the plains were devastated by sheets of lava, and\r\ncones and craters were piled up through hundreds and thousands of feet,\r\nhave for the present, at least, passed away.\r\n\r\n[1] _Geol.-topographischer Atlas von Neu-Seeland_, von Dr. Ferd. von\r\nHochstetter und Dr. A.

Dyson, who describes the\r\neruption of steam.\r\n\r\n[3] Mr. Froude figures and describes the two terraces, the \"White\" and\r\n\"Pink,\" in _Oceana_, 2nd edition, pp. 285-291.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nTERTIARY VOLCANIC DISTRICTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nANTRIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an easy transition to pass from the consideration of European and\r\nother dormant, or extinct, volcanic regions to those of the British\r\nIsles, though the volcanic forces may have become in this latter\r\ninstance quiescent for a somewhat longer period. In all the cases we\r\nhave been considering, whether those of Central Italy, of the Rhine and\r\nMoselle, of Auvergne, or of Syria and Arabia, the cones and craters of\r\neruption are generally present entire, or but slightly modified in form\r\nand size by the effects of time. But in the case of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic districts of the British Isles this is not so. On the contrary,\r\nthese more prominent features of vulcanicity over the surface of the\r\nground have been removed by the agents of denudation, and our\r\nobservations are confined to the phenomena presented by extensive sheets\r\nof lava and beds of ash, or the stumps and necks of former vents of\r\neruption, together with dykes of trap by which the plateau-lavas are\r\neverywhere traversed or intersected.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic region of the British Isles extends at intervals from the\r\nNorth-east of Ireland through the Island of Mull and adjoining districts\r\non the mainland of Morvern and Ardnamurchan into the Isle of Skye, and\r\ncomprises several smaller islets; the whole being included in the\r\ngeneral name of the Inner Hebrides. It is doubtful if the volcanic lavas\r\nof Co. Antrim were ever physically connected with those of the west of\r\nScotland, though they may be considered as contemporary with them; and\r\nin all cases the existing tracts of volcanic rock are mere fragments of\r\nthose originally formed by the extrusion of lavas from vents of\r\neruption. In addition to these, there are large areas of volcanic rock\r\noverspread by the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Geological Age._--The British volcanic eruptions now under\r\nconsideration are all later than the Cretaceous period. Throughout\r\nAntrim, and in parts of Mull, the lavas are found resting on highly\r\neroded faces either of the Upper Chalk (Fig. 27), or, where it has been\r\naltogether denuded away, on still older Mesozoic strata. From the\r\nrelations of the basaltic sheets of Antrim to the Upper Chalk, it is\r\nclear that the latter formation, after its deposition beneath the waters\r\nof the Cretaceous seas, was elevated into dry land and exposed to a long\r\nperiod of subaërial erosion before the first sheets of lava invaded the\r\nsurface of the ground. We are, therefore, tolerably safe in considering\r\nthe first eruptions to belong to the Tertiary period; but the evidence,\r\nderived as it is exclusively from plant remains, is somewhat conflicting\r\nas to the precise epoch to which the lavas and beds of tuff containing\r\nthe plant-remains are to be referred. The probabilities appear to be\r\nthat they are of Miocene age; and if so, the trachytic lavas, which in\r\nAntrim are older than those containing plants, may be referred to a\r\nstill earlier epoch--namely, that of the Eocene.[1] As plant remains are\r\nnot very distinctive, the question regarding the exact time of the first\r\nvolcanic eruptions will probably remain for ever undecided; but we are\r\nnot likely to be much in error if we consider the entire volcanic period\r\nto range from the close of the Eocene to that of the Miocene; by far the\r\ngreater mass of the volcanic rocks being referable to the latter epoch.\r\n\r\nIn describing the British volcanic districts it will be most convenient\r\nto deal with them in three divisions--viz., those of Antrim, Mull, and\r\nSkye, commencing with Antrim.[2]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Volcanic Area._--The great sheets of basalt and other volcanic\r\nproducts of the North-east of Ireland overspread almost the whole of the\r\nCounty Antrim, and adjoining districts of Londonderry and Tyrone,\r\nbreaking off in a fine mural escarpment along the northern shore of\r\nBelfast Lough and the sea coast throughout the whole of its range from\r\nLarne Harbour to Lough Foyle; the only direction in which these features\r\nsubside into the general level of the country being around the shores of\r\nLough Neagh. Several outliers of the volcanic sheets are to be found at\r\nintervals around the great central plateau; such as those of Rathlin\r\nIsland, Island Magee, and Scrabo Hill in Co. Down. The area of the\r\nbasaltic plateau may be roughly estimated at 2,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--\"The White Rocks,\" Portrush, Co. Antrim,\r\nshowing the plateau-basalt resting on an eroded surface of the Upper\r\nChalk, with bands of flint.--(From a photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe truncated edges of this marginal escarpment rising to levels of\r\n1,000 to 1,260 feet, as in the case of Benevenagh in Co. Derry, and\r\n1,825 feet at Mullaghmore, attest an originally greatly more extended\r\nrange of the basaltic sheets; and it is not improbable that at the close\r\nof the Miocene epoch they extended right across the present estuary of\r\nLough Foyle to the flanks of the mountains of Inishowen in Donegal in\r\none direction, and to those of Slieve Croob in the other. In the\r\ndirection of Scotland the promontories of Kintyre and Islay doubtless\r\nformed a part of the original margin. Throughout this vast area the\r\nvolcanic lavas rest on an exceedingly varied rocky floor, both as\r\nregards composition and geological age. (See Fig. 28.) Throughout the\r\ncentral, southern, eastern, and northern parts of their extent, the\r\nChalk formation may be considered to form this floor; but in the\r\ndirection of Armagh and Tyrone, towards the southwestern margin, the\r\nbasaltic sheets are found resting indiscriminately on Silurian,\r\nCarboniferous, and Triassic strata. The general relations of the\r\nplateau-basalts to the underlying formations show, that at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous period there had been considerable terrestrial\r\ndisturbances and great subaërial denudation, resulting in some cases in\r\nthe complete destruction of the whole of the Cretaceous strata, before\r\nthe lava floods were poured out; owing to which, these latter are found\r\nresting on formations of older date than the Cretaceous.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Section across the volcanic plateau of Antrim,\r\nfrom the Highlands of Inishowen, Co. Donegal, on the N.W., to Belfast\r\nLough on the S.E., to show the relations of the volcanic rocks to the\r\nolder formations.--B. Basaltic sheets breaking off in high escarpments;\r\nT.

Starkie Gardner, from a recent comparison of the\r\nplant-remains of Antrim and Mull, concludes that \"that they might belong\r\nto any age between the beginning and the end of the warmer Eocene\r\nperiod; and that they cannot be of earlier, and are unlikely to be of\r\nlater, date.\"--_Trans. Palæont. Soc._, vol. xxxvii. (1883).\r\n\r\n[2] Having dealt with this district rather fully in _The Physical\r\nGeology and Geography of Ireland_ (Edit. 1891, p. 81), and also in my\r\nPresidential Address (Section C.) at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation, 1874, a brief review of the subject will be sufficient\r\nhere, the reader being referred to the former treatises for fuller\r\ndetails. The following should also be consulted: Gen. Portlock, _Geology\r\nof Londonderry and Tyrone_ (1843); Sir A. Geikie, \"History of Volcanic\r\nAction during the Tertiary Period in the British Isles,\" _Trans. Roy.\r\nSoc. Edinburgh_, 1888; and the _Descriptive Memoirs_ of the Geological\r\nSurvey relating to this tract of country.\r\n\r\n[3] Owing to the superposition of the basaltic masses on beds of chalk\r\nthroughout a long line of coast, we are presented with the curious\r\nspectacle of the whitest rocks in nature overlain by the blackest, as\r\nmay be seen in the cliffs at Larne, Glenarm, Kinbane and Portrush. (See\r\nFig. 27.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSION OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c._) _First Stage._--The earliest eruptions of lava in the North-east\r\nof Ireland belonged to the highly acid varieties, consisting of\r\nquartz-trachyte with tridymite.[1] This rock rises to the surface at\r\nTardree and Brown Dod hills and Templepatrick. It consists of a\r\nlight-greyish felsitic paste enclosing grains of smoke-quartz, crystals\r\nof sanidine, plagioclase and biotite, with a little magnetite and\r\napatite. It is a rock of peculiar interest from the fact that it is\r\nalmost unique in the British Islands, and has its petrological\r\ncounterpart rather amongst the volcanic hills of the Siebengebirge than\r\nelsewhere. It is generally consolidated with the columnar structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Part of the section shown in the quarry at\r\nTemplepatrick, showing the superposition of the basalt (_d_) to the\r\ntrachyte (_b_), with the intervening bed of flint gravel (_c_). All\r\nthese rocks are seen to rest upon an eroded surface of the Chalk\r\nformation (_a_).]\r\n\r\nThe trachyte appears to have been extruded from one or more vents in a\r\nviscous condition, the principal vent being probably situated under\r\nTardree mountain, where the rock occurs in greatest mass, and it\r\nprobably arose as a dome-shaped mass, with a somewhat extended margin,\r\nabove the floor of Chalk which formed the surface of the ground.[2]\r\n(Fig. 27.) At Templepatrick the columnar trachyte may be observed\r\nresting on the Chalk, or upon a layer of flint gravel interposed between\r\nthe two rocks, and which has been thrust out of position by a later\r\nintrusion of basalt coming in from the side.[3] It is to be observed,\r\nhowever, that the trachytic lavas nowhere appear cropping out along with\r\nthe sheets of basalt around the escarpments overlooking the sea, or\r\ninland; showing that they did not spread very far from their vents of\r\neruption; a fact illustrating the lower viscosity, or fluidity, of the\r\nacid lavas as compared with those of the basic type.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Second Stage._--After an interval, probably of long duration, a\r\nsecond eruption of volcanic matter took place over the entire area; but\r\nnow the acid lavas of the first stage are replaced by basic lavas. Now,\r\nfor the first time, vast masses of basalt and dolerite are extruded both\r\nfrom vents of eruption and fissures; and, owing to their extreme\r\nviscosity, spread themselves far and wide until they reach the margin of\r\nsome uprising ground of old Palæozoic or Metamorphic rocks by which the\r\nvolcanic plain is almost surrounded. The great lava sheets thus produced\r\nare generally more or less amorphous, vesicular and amygdaloidal, often\r\nexhibiting the globular concentric structure, and weathering rapidly to\r\na kind of ferruginous sand or clay under the influence of the\r\natmosphere. Successive extrusions of these lavas produce successive\r\nbeds, which are piled one over the other in some places to a depth of\r\n600 feet; and at the close of the stage, when the volcanic forces had\r\nfor the time exhausted themselves, the whole of the North-east of\r\nIreland must have presented an aspect not unlike that of one of those\r\ngreat tracts of similar lava in the region of Idaho and the Snake River\r\nin Western America, described in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Third Stage (Inter-volcanic)._--The third stage may be described\r\nas inter-volcanic. Owing to the formation of a basin, probably not deep,\r\nand with gently sloping sides, a large lake was formed over the centre\r\nof the area above described. Its floor was basalt, and the streams from\r\nthe surrounding uplands carried down leaves and stems of trees, strewing\r\nthem over its bed. Occasionally eruptions of ash took place from small\r\nvents, forming the ash-beds with plants found at Ballypallidy, Glenarm,\r\nand along the coast as at Carrick-a-raide. The streams also brought down\r\nsand and gravel from the uprising domes of trachyte, and deposited them\r\nover the lake-bed along with the erupted ashes.[4] The epoch we are now\r\nreferring to was one of economic importance; as, towards its close,\r\nthere was an extensive deposition of pisolitic iron-ore over the floor\r\nof the lake, sometimes to the depth of two or three feet. This ore has\r\nbeen extensively worked in recent years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Cliff section above the Giant's Causeway, coast\r\nof Co. Antrim, showing successive tiers of basaltic lava, with\r\nintervening bands of bole.]\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Fourth Stage (Volcanic)._--The last stage described was brought\r\nto a termination by a second outburst of basic lavas on a scale probably\r\neven grander than the preceding. These lavas consisting of basalt and\r\ndolerite, with their varieties, and extruded from vents and fissures,\r\nspread themselves in all directions over the pre-existing lake deposits\r\nor the older sheets of augitic lava, and probably entirely buried the\r\ntrachytic hills. These later sheets solidified into more solid masses\r\nthan those of the second stage. They form successive terraces with\r\ncolumnar structure, each terrace differing from that above and below it\r\nin the size and length of the columns, and separated by thin bands of\r\n\"bole\" (decomposed lava), often reddish in colour, clearly defining the\r\nlimits of the successive lava-flows. Nowhere throughout the entire\r\nvolcanic area are these successive terraces so finely laid open to view\r\nas along the north coast of Antrim, where the lofty mural cliffs, worn\r\nback into successive bays with intervening headlands by the\r\nirresistible force of the Atlantic waves, present to the spectator a\r\nvertical section from 300 to 400 feet in height, in which the successive\r\ntiers of columnar basalt, separated by thin bands of bole, are seen to\r\nrise one above the other from the water's edge to the summit of the\r\ncliff, as shown in Fig. 30. Here, also, at the western extremity of the\r\nline of cliffs we find that remarkable group of vertical basaltic\r\ncolumns, stretching from the base of the cliff into the Atlantic, and\r\nknown far and wide by the name of \"The Giant's Causeway,\" the upper ends\r\nof the columns forming a tolerably level surface, gently sloping\r\nseawards, and having very much the aspect of an artificial tesselated\r\npavement on a huge scale. A portion of the Causeway, with the cliff in\r\nthe background, is shown in the figure (Fig. 31). The columns are\r\nremarkable for their symmetry, being generally hexagonal, though\r\noccasionally they are pentagons, and each column is horizontally\r\ntraversed by joints of the ball-and-socket form, thus dividing them into\r\ndistinct courses of natural masonry. These are very well shown in the\r\naccompanying view of the remarkable basaltic pillars known as \"The\r\nChimneys,\" which stand up from the margin of the headland adjoining the\r\nCauseway, monuments of past denudation, as they originally formed\r\nindividuals amongst the group belonging to one of the terraces in the\r\nadjoining coast.[5] (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--The Giant's Causeway, formed of basaltic\r\ncolumns in a vertical position, and of pentagonal or hexagonal section;\r\nabove the Causeway is seen a portion of the cliff composed of tiers of\r\nlava with intervening bands of bole, etc.--(From a photograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--\"The Chimneys,\" columns of basalt on slope of\r\ncliff overlooking the Atlantic, north coast of Co. Antrim. The\r\nhorizontal segments, or cup-and-ball joints, of the columns are well\r\nshown in this figure. (From a photograph.)]\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Original Thickness of the Antrim Lavas._--It is impossible to\r\ndetermine with certainty what may have been the original thickness of\r\nthe accumulated sheets of basic lavas with their associated beds of ash\r\nand bole. The greatest known thickness of the lower zone of lavas is, as\r\nI have already stated, about 600 feet. The intermediate beds of ash and\r\nbole sometimes attain a thickness of 40 feet, and the upper group of\r\nbasalt about 400 feet; these together would constitute a series of over\r\n1,000 feet in thickness. But this amount, great as it is, is undoubtedly\r\nbelow the original maximum, as the uppermost sheets have been removed by\r\ndenuding agencies, we know not to what extent. Nor is it of any great\r\nimportance. Sufficient remains to enable us to form a just conception of\r\nthe magnitude both as regards thickness and extent of the erupted matter\r\nof the Miocene period over the North-east of Ireland and adjoining\r\nsubmerged tracts, and of the magnitude of the volcanic operations\r\nnecessary for the production of such masses.\r\n\r\n(_h._) _Volcanic Necks._--As already remarked, no craters of eruption\r\nsurvive throughout the volcanic region of the North-east of Ireland,\r\nowing to the enormous extent of the denudation which this region has\r\nundergone since the Miocene Epoch; but the old \"necks\" of such\r\ncraters--in other words, the pipes filled with either solid basalt, or\r\nbasalt and ashes--are still to be found at intervals over the whole\r\narea. Owing to the greater solidity of the lava which filled up these\r\n\"necks\" over the plateau-basaltic sheets which surround them, they\r\nappear as bosses or hills rising above the general level of the ground.\r\nOne of these bosses of highly columnar basalt occurs between Portrush\r\nand Bushmills, not far from Dunluce Castle, another at Scawt Hill, near\r\nGlenarm, and a third at Carmoney Hill above Belfast Lough. But by far\r\nthe most prominent of these old solidified vents of eruption is that of\r\nSleamish, a conspicuous mountain which rises above the general level of\r\nthe plateau near Ballymena, and attains an elevation of 1,437 feet above\r\nthe sea. Seen from the west, the mountain has the appearance of a\r\nround-topped cone; but on examination it is found to be in reality a\r\nhuge dyke, breaking off abruptly towards the north-west, in which\r\ndirection it reaches its greatest height, then sloping downwards towards\r\nthe east. This form suggests that Sleamish is in reality one of the\r\nfissure-vents of eruption rather than the neck of an old volcano. The\r\nrock of which it is formed consists of exceedingly massive,\r\ncoarsely-crystalline dolerite, rich in olivine, and divided into large\r\nquadrangular blocks by parallel joint planes. Its junction with the\r\nplateau-basalt from which it rises can nowhere be seen; but at the\r\nnearest point where the two rocks are traceable the plateau-basalt\r\nappears to be somewhat indurated; breaking with a splintery fracture and\r\na sharp ring under the hammer, suggesting that the lava of Sleamish had\r\nbeen extruded through the horizontal sheets, and had considerably\r\nindurated the portions in contact with, or in proximity to, it.[6]\r\nAmongst the vents filled with ash and agglomerate, the most remarkable\r\nis that of Carrick-a-raide, near Ballycastle. It forms this rocky island\r\nand a portion of the adjoining coast, where the beds of ash are finely\r\ndisplayed; consisting of fragments and bombs of basalt, with pieces of\r\nchalk, flint, and peperino, which is irregularly bedded. These ash-beds\r\nattain a thickness of about 120 feet just below the road to Ballycastle,\r\nbut rapidly tail out in both directions from the locality of the vent.\r\nJust below the ash-beds, the white chalk with flints may be seen\r\nextending down into the sea-bed. Nowhere in Antrim is there such a\r\ndisplay of volcanic ash and agglomerate as at this spot.[7]\r\n\r\n(_i._) _Dykes: Conditions under which they were Erupted._--No one can\r\nvisit the geological sections in Co. Antrim and the adjoining districts\r\nof Down, Armagh, Derry, and Tyrone, without being struck by the great\r\nnumber and variety of the igneous dykes by which the rocks are\r\ntraversed. The great majority of these dykes are basaltic, and they are\r\nfound traversing all the formations, including the Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary basaltic sheets. The Carlingford and Mourne Mountains are\r\nseamed with such dykes, and they are splendidly laid open to view along\r\nthe coast south of Newcastle in Co. Down, as also along the Antrim coast\r\nfrom Belfast to Larne. The fine old castle of Carrickfergus has its\r\nfoundations on one of those dyke-like intrusions, but one of greater\r\nsize than ordinary. All the dykes here referred to are not, however, of\r\nthe same age, as is conclusively proved by sections amongst the Mourne\r\nMountains where cliffs of Lower Silurian strata, superimposed on the\r\nintrusive granite of the district, exhibit two sets of basaltic\r\ndykes--one (the older) abruptly terminated at the granite margin, the\r\nother and newer penetrating the granite and Silurian rocks alike. It is\r\nnot improbable that the older dykes belong to the Carboniferous or\r\nPermian age, while the newer are with equal probability of Tertiary age.\r\nSir A. Geikie has shown that the Tertiary dykes of the North of Ireland\r\nare representatives of others occurring at intervals over the North of\r\nEngland, and Central and Western Scotland, all pointing towards the\r\ncentral region of volcanic activity; or in a parallel direction thereto,\r\napproximating to the N.W. in Ireland, the Island of Islay, and East\r\nArgyleshire, but in the centre of Scotland generally ranging from east\r\nto west.[8] The area affected by the dykes of undoubted Tertiary age\r\nGeikie estimates at no less than 40,000 square miles--a territory\r\ngreater than either Scotland or Ireland, and equal to more than a third\r\nof the total land-surface of the British Isles;[9] and he regards them\r\nas posterior \"to the rest of the geological structures of the regions\r\nwhich they traverse.\" It is clear that the dykes referred to belong to\r\none great system of eruption or intrusion; and they may be regarded as\r\nthe manifestation of the final effort of internal forces over this\r\nregion of the British Isles. They testify to the existence of a\r\ncontinuous _magma_ (or shell) of augitic lava beneath the crust; and as\r\nthe aggregate horizontal extent of all these dykes, or of the fissures\r\nwhich they fill, must be very considerable, it is clear that the crust\r\nthrough which they have been extruded has received an accession of\r\nhorizontal space, and has been fissured by forces acting from beneath,\r\nas the late Mr. Hopkins, of Cambridge, had explained on mechanical\r\ngrounds in his elaborate essay many years ago.[10] This view occurred to\r\nmyself when examining the region of the North-east of Ireland, but I was\r\nnot then aware that it had been dealt with on mathematical principles by\r\nso eminent a mathematician. The bulging of the crust is a necessary\r\nconsequence of the absence of plication of the strata due to the\r\nextrusion of this enormous quantity of molten lava; and the intrusion of\r\nthousands of dykes over the North-east of Ireland, unaccompanied by\r\nfoldings of the strata, must have added a horizontal space of several\r\nthousand feet to that region.[11]\r\n\r\n[1] A peculiar form of crystalline quartz first recognized in this rock\r\nby a distinguished German petrologist, the late Prof. A. von Lasaulx,\r\nwho visited the district in 1876.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir A. Geikie has disputed the correctness of the view, which I\r\nadvocated as far back as 1874, that the trachytic lavas of Antrim are\r\nthe earliest products of volcanic action; but at the time he wrote his\r\npaper on the volcanic history of these islands, it was not known that\r\npebbles of this trachyte are largely distributed amongst the ash-beds\r\nwhich occur in the very midst of the overlying basaltic sheets, as I\r\nshall have to explain later on. This discovery puts the question at rest\r\nas regards the relations of the two sets of rocks.\r\n\r\n[3] This remarkable section at the chalk quarries of Templepatrick the\r\nauthor has figured and described in the _Physical Geology and Geography\r\nof Ireland_, p. 99, 2nd edit. (1891), where the reader will find the\r\nsubject discussed more fully than can be done here.\r\n\r\n[4] These pebbles were first noticed by Mr. McHenry, of the Irish\r\nGeological Survey, in 1890.\r\n\r\n[5] The vertical position of the columns of the Giant's Causeway is\r\nrather enigmatical. The Causeway cannot be a dyke, as has often been\r\nsupposed, otherwise the columns would have been horizontal, _i.e._, at\r\nright angles to the sides of the dyke. Mr. R. G. Symes, of the\r\nGeological Survey, has suggested that the Causeway columns have been\r\nvertically lowered between two lines of fault, and that originally they\r\nformed a portion of the tier of beautiful columns seen in the cliff\r\nabove, and known as \"The Organ.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Sleamish and several other of the Antrim vents are described by Sir\r\nA.

These districts have been the subject of critical and\r\ndetailed study by several geologists, from McCulloch down to the present\r\nday; and amongst the more recent, Sir Archibald Geikie and Professor\r\nJudd hold the chief place. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the\r\nvolcanic phenomena by these two accomplished observers has led them to\r\nvery different conclusions as regards several important points in the\r\nvolcanic history of these groups of islands; as, for example, regarding\r\nthe relative ages of the plateau-basalts and the acid rocks, such as the\r\ntrachytes and granophyres; again as regards the presence of distinct\r\ncentres of eruption; and also as regards the relations of the gabbros of\r\nSkye to the basaltic sheets. Such being the case, it would appear the\r\nheight of rashness on the part of the writer, especially in the absence\r\nof a detailed examination of the sections over the whole region, to\r\nventure on a statement of opinion regarding the points at issue; and he\r\nmust, therefore, content himself with a brief account of the phenomena\r\nas gathered from a perusal of the writings of these and other\r\nobservers,[1] guided also to some extent by the analogous phenomena\r\npresented by the volcanic region of the North-east of Ireland.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _General Features._--As in the case of the Antrim district, the\r\nIsland of Mull and adjoining tracts present us with the spectacle of a\r\nvast accumulation of basaltic lava-flows, piled layer upon layer, with\r\nintervening beds of bole and tuff, up to a thickness, according to\r\nGeikie, of about 3,500 feet. At the grand headland of Gribon, on the\r\nwest coast, the basaltic sheets are seen to rise in one sheer sweep to a\r\nheight of 1,600 feet, and then to stretch away with a slight easterly\r\ndip under Ben More at a distance of some eight miles. This mountain, the\r\nupper part of which is formed of beds of ashes, reaches an elevation of\r\n3,169 feet, so that the accumulated thickness of the beds of basalt\r\nunder the higher part of the mountain must be at least equal to the\r\namount stated above--that is, twice as great as the representative\r\nmasses of Antrim. The base of the volcanic series is seen at Carsaig and\r\nGribon to rest on Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks, like those of Antrim;\r\nhence the Tertiary age is fully established by the evidence of\r\nsuperposition. This was further confirmed by the discovery by the Duke\r\nof Argyll,[2] some years ago (1850), of bands of flint-gravel and tuff,\r\nwith dicotyledonous leaves amongst the basalts of Ardtun Head. The\r\nbasement beds of tuff and gravel contain, besides pebbles of flint and\r\nchalk, others of sanidine trachyte, showing that highly acid lavas had\r\nbeen extruded and consolidated before the first eruption of the\r\nplateau-basalts; another point of analogy between the volcanic\r\nphenomenon of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides. These great sheets of\r\naugitic lava extend over the whole of the northern tract of Mull, the\r\nIsles of Ulva and Staffa, and for a distance of several miles inwards\r\nfrom the northern shore of the Sound of Mull, covering the wild\r\nmoorlands of Morvern and Ardnamurchan, where they terminate in\r\nescarpments and outlying masses, indicating an originally much more\r\nextended range than at the present day. The summits of Ben More and its\r\nneighbouring height, Ben Buy, are formed of beds of ash and tuff. The\r\nvolcanic plateau is, according to Judd, abruptly terminated along the\r\nsouthern side by a large vault, bringing the basalt in contact with\r\nPalæozoic rocks.[3]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Granophyres._--The greater part of the tract lying to the south\r\nof Loch na Keal, which almost divides Mull into two islands, and\r\nextending southwards and eastwards to the shores of the Firth of Lorn\r\nand the Sound of Mull, is formed of a peculiar group of acid (or highly\r\nsilicated) rocks, classed under the general term of \"Granophyres.\" These\r\nrocks approach towards true granites in one direction, and through\r\nquartz-porphyry and felsite to rhyolite in another--probably depending\r\nupon the conditions of cooling and consolidation. In their mode of\r\nweathering and general appearance on a large scale, they present a\r\nmarked contrast to the basic lavas with which they are in contact from\r\nthe coast of L. na Keal to that of L. Buy. The nature of this contact,\r\nwhether indicating the priority of the granophyres to the\r\nplateau-basalts or otherwise, is a matter of dispute between the two\r\nobservers above named; but the circumstantial account given by Sir A.\r\nGeikie,[4] accompanied by drawings of special sections showing this\r\ncontact, appears to prove that the granophyre is the newer of the two\r\nmasses of volcanic rock, and that it has been intruded amongst the\r\nbasaltic-lavas at a late period in the volcanic history of these\r\nislands. A copy of one of these sketches is here given (Fig. 33),\r\naccording to which the felsite is shown to penetrate the basaltic sheets\r\nat Alt na Searmoin in Mull; other sections seen at Cruach Torr an\r\nLochain, and on the south side of Beinn Fada, appear to lead to similar\r\nconclusions. These rocks are penetrated by numerous basaltic dykes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Section at Alt na Searmoin, Mull, to show the\r\nintrusion of felsite (or granophyre) (_b_) into basalt and dolerite\r\n(_a_) of the plateau-basalt series.--(Geikie.)]\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Representative Rocks of Mourne and Carlingford,\r\nIreland._--Assuming Sir A. Geikie's view to be correct, it is possible\r\nthat we may have in the granite and quartz-porphyries of Mourne and\r\nCarlingford representatives of the granites, granophyres, and other acid\r\nrocks of the later period of Mull. The granite of Mourne is peculiar in\r\nstructure, and differs from the ordinary type of that rock in which the\r\nsilica forms the ground mass. In the case of the granite of the Mourne\r\nMountains, the rock consists of a crystalline granular aggregate of\r\northoclase, albite, smoke-quartz, and mica; it is also full of drusy\r\ncavities, in which the various minerals crystallise out in very perfect\r\nform. As far as regards direct evidence, the age of this rock can only\r\nbe stated to be post-Carboniferous, and earlier than certain Tertiary\r\nbasaltic dykes by which it is traversed. The granophyres of Mull are\r\ntraversed by similar dykes, which are representatives of the very latest\r\nstage of volcanic action in the British Islands. The author is therefore\r\ninclined to concur with Sir A. Geikie in assigning to the granite of the\r\nMourne Mountains, and the representative felsitic rocks of the\r\nCarlingford Mountains, a Tertiary age--in which case the analogy between\r\nthe volcanic phenomena of the Inner Hebrides and of the North-east of\r\nIreland would seem to be complete.[5]\r\n\r\n[1] Geikie, _Proc.

Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxx. p. 235.\r\n\r\n[5] This view the author has expressed in a recent edition of _The\r\nPhysical Geology of Ireland_, p. 177 (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nISLE OF SKYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the largest and most important of all the Tertiary volcanic\r\ndistricts, but owing to the extensive denudation to which, in common\r\nwith other Tertiary volcanic regions of the British Isles, it has been\r\nsubjected, its present limits are very restricted comparatively to its\r\noriginal extent. Not only is this evident from the manner in which the\r\nbasaltic sheets terminate along the sea-coast in grand mural cliffs, as\r\nopposite \"Macleod's Maidens,\" and at the entrance to Lough Bracadale on\r\nthe western coast, but the evidence is, according to Sir A. Geikie,\r\nstill more striking along the eastern coast; showing that the Jurassic,\r\nand other older rocks there visible, were originally buried deep under\r\nthe basaltic sheets which have been stripped from off that part of the\r\ncountry. These great plateau-basalts occupy about three-fourths of the\r\nentire island along the western and northern areas, rising into terraced\r\nmountains over 2,000 feet in height, and are deeply furrowed by glens\r\nand arms of the sea, along which the general structure of the tableland\r\nis laid open, sometimes for leagues at a time.\r\n\r\nIt is towards the south-eastern part of the island that the most\r\ninteresting and important phenomena are centred; for here we meet with\r\nrepresentatives of the acid (or highly silicated) group of rocks, and\r\nof remarkable beds of gabbro, which have long attracted the attention of\r\npetrologists. These latter beds, throughout a considerable distance\r\nround the flanks of the Cuillin Hills, are interposed between the acid\r\nrocks and the plateau-basalts; but towards the north, on approaching\r\nLough Sligahan, the acid rocks, consisting of granophyres,\r\nquartz-porphyries, and hornblendic-granitites, are in direct contact\r\nwith the plateau-basalts; and, according to the very circumstantial\r\naccount of Sir A. Geikie, are intrusive into them; not only sending\r\nveins into the basaltic sheets, but also producing a marked alteration\r\nin their structure where they approach the newer intrusive mass. Equally\r\ncircumstantial is the same author's account of the relations of the\r\ngranophyres to the gabbros,[1] as seen at Meall Dearg and the western\r\nborder of the Cuillin Hills--where the former rock may be seen to send\r\nnumerous veins into the latter. Not only is this so, but the granophyre\r\nis frequently seen to truncate, and abruptly terminate some of the\r\nbasaltic dykes by which the basic sheets are traversed--as in the\r\nneighbourhood of Beinn na Dubhaic. All these phenomena strongly remind\r\nus of the conditions of similar rocks amongst the mountains of Mourne\r\nand Carlingford in Ireland; where, at Barnaveve, the syenite (or\r\nhornblendic quartz-felsite) is seen to break through the masses of\r\nolivine gabbro, and send numerous veins into this latter rock.[2]\r\n\r\nThe interpretation here briefly sketched differs widely from that\r\narrived at by Professor Judd. The granitoid masses of the Red Mountains\r\n(Beinn Dearg) and the neighbouring heights are, in his view, the roots\r\nof the great volcano from which were erupted the various lavas; the\r\nearlier eruptions producing the acid lavas, to be followed by the\r\ngabbros, and these by the plateau-basaltic sheets, which stretch away\r\ntowards the north and west into several peninsulas. Thus he holds that\r\n\"the rocks of basic composition were ejected subsequently to those of\r\nthe acid variety,\" and appeals to various sections in confirmation of\r\nthis view.[3] To reconcile these views is at present impossible; but as\r\nthe controversy between these two observers is probably not yet closed,\r\nthere is room for hope that the true interpretation of the relations of\r\nthese rocks to each other will ere long be fully established.\r\n\r\n[1] Geikie, _loc. cit._, p. 161, etc.\r\n\r\n[2] _Physical Geology of Ireland_, 2nd edition, p. 174 (Fig. 21).\r\nProfessor Judd has also come to the conclusion that the granite of\r\nMourne is of Tertiary age, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxx. p. 275.\r\n\r\n[3] Judd, _loc. cit._, p. 254.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SCUIR OF EIGG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the more remarkable of the smaller islets are those of Eigg,\r\nRum, Canna, and Muck, lying between Mull on the south and Skye on the\r\nnorth, and undoubtedly at one time physically connected together. The\r\nIsland of Eigg is especially remarkable for the fact, as stated by\r\nGeikie, that here we have the one solitary case of \"a true superficial\r\nstream of acid lava--that of the Scuir of Eigg.\"[1] (Fig. 34.) This\r\nforms a sinuous ridge, composed of pitchstone of several kinds, of over\r\ntwo miles in length, rising from the midst of a tableland of bedded\r\nbasalt and tuff to a height of 1,289 feet above the ocean; the\r\nplateau-basalt is traversed by basaltic dykes, ranging in a N.W.-S.E.\r\ndirection. But what is specially remarkable is the evidence afforded by\r\nan examination of the course of the Scuir, that it follows the channel\r\nof an ancient river-valley, which has been hollowed out in the surface\r\nof the plateau. The course of this channel is indicated by the presence\r\nof a deposit of river-gravel, which in some places forms a sort of\r\ncushion between the base of the Scuir and the side of the channel. Over\r\nthis gravel-bed the viscous pitchstone-lava appears to have flowed,\r\ntaking possession of the river-channel, and also of the beds of several\r\nsmall tributary streams which flowed into the channel of the Scuir. The\r\nrecent date of the pitchstone forming this remarkable mural ridge, once\r\noccupying the bed of a river-channel, is shown by the fact that the\r\nbasaltic dykes which traverse the plateau-basalts are truncated by the\r\nriver-gravel, which is, therefore, more recent; and, as we have seen,\r\nthe pitchstone stream is more recent than the river-gravel. But at the\r\ntime when this last volcanic eruption took place, the physical geography\r\nof the whole region must have been very different from that of the\r\npresent time. From the character and composition of the pebbles in the\r\nold river-bed, amongst which are Cambrian sandstone, quartzite,\r\nclay-slate, and white Jurassic limestone, Sir A. Geikie concludes that\r\nwhen the river was flowing, the island must have been connected with the\r\nmainland to the east where the parent masses of these pebbles are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--View of the Scuir of Eigg from the east. The\r\nlower portion of the mountain is formed of bedded basalt, or dolerite\r\nwith numerous dykes and veins of basalt, felstone, and pitchstone; the\r\nupper cliff, or Scuir, is composed of pitchstone of newer age, the\r\nremnant of a lava flow which once filled a river channel in the basaltic\r\nsheets. A dyke, or sheet, of porphyry is seen to be interposed between\r\nthe Scuir and the basaltic sheets.--(After Geikie.)]\r\n\r\n_Effects of Denudation._--The position of the Scuir of Eigg and its\r\nrelations to the basaltic sheets show the enormous amount of denudation\r\nwhich these latter have undergone since the stream of pitchstone-lava\r\nfilled the old river channel. The walls, or banks, of the channel have\r\nbeen denuded away, thus converting the pitchstone casting into a\r\nprojecting wall of rock. That it originally extended outwards into the\r\nocean to a far greater distance than at present is evident from the\r\nabruptly truncated face of the cliff; and yet this remarkable volcanic\r\nmass seems to have been, perhaps, the most recent exhibition of volcanic\r\naction to be found in the British Isles. It is perhaps, on this account,\r\nthe most striking of the numerous examples exhibited throughout the West\r\nof Scotland and the North-east of Ireland of the enormous amount of\r\ndenudation to which these districts have been subjected since the\r\nextinction of the volcanic fires; and this at a period to which we\r\ncannot assign a date more ancient than that of the Pliocene. Yet, let us\r\nconsider for a moment to what physical vicissitudes these districts have\r\nbeen subjected since that epoch. Assuming, as we may with confidence,\r\nthat the volcanic eruptions were subaërial, and that the tracts covered\r\nby the plateau-basalts were in the condition of dry land when the\r\neruptions commenced, in this condition they continued in the main\r\nthroughout the period of volcanic activity. But the eruptions had\r\nscarcely ceased, and the lava floods and dykes become consolidated,\r\nbefore the succeeding glacial epoch set in; when the snows and glaciers\r\nof the Scottish Highlands gradually descending from their original\r\nmountain heights, and spreading outwards in all directions, ultimately\r\nenveloped the whole of the region we are now considering until it was\r\nentirely concealed beneath a mantle of ice moving slowly, but\r\nirresistibly, outwards towards the Atlantic, crossing the deep channels,\r\nsuch as the Sound of Mull and the Minch, climbing up the sides of\r\nopposing rocks and islands until even the Outer Hebrides and the\r\nNorth-east of Ireland were covered by one vast mantle of ice and snow.\r\nThe movement of such a body of ice over the land must have been attended\r\nwith a large amount of abrasion of the rocky floor; nor have the\r\nevidences of that abrasion entirely disappeared even at the present day.\r\nWe still detect the grooves and scorings on the rock-surfaces where they\r\nhave been protected by a coating of boulder clay; and we still find the\r\nsurface strewn with the blocks and _débris_ of that mighty ice-flood.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been the amount of erosion caused by the great\r\nice-sheet, it was chiefly confined to the more or less horizontal\r\nsurface-planes. Erosion of another kind was to succeed, and to produce\r\nmore lasting effects on the configuration of the surface. On the\r\ndisappearance of the ice-sheet, an epoch characterised by milder\r\nconditions of climate set in. This was accompanied by subsidence and\r\nsubmersion of large tracts of the land during the Interglacial stage; so\r\nthat the sea rose to heights of several hundred feet above the present\r\nlevel, and has left behind stratified gravels with shells at these\r\nelevations in protected places. During this period of depression and of\r\nsubsequent re-emergence the wave-action of the Atlantic waters must have\r\ntold severely on the coast and islands, wearing them into cliffs and\r\nescarpments, furrowing out channels and levelling obstructions. Such\r\naction has gone on down to the present day. The North-west of Scotland\r\nand of Ireland has been subjected throughout a very lengthened period to\r\nthe wear and tear of the Atlantic billows. In the case of the former,\r\nthe remarkable breakwater which nature has thrown athwart the North-west\r\nHighlands in the direction of the waves, forming the chain of islands\r\nconstituting the Outer Hebrides, and composed of very tough Archæan\r\ngneiss and schist, has done much to retard the inroads which the waves\r\nmight otherwise have made on the Isle of Skye; while Coll and Tiree,\r\ncomposed of similar materials, have acted with similar beneficent effect\r\nfor Mull and the adjoining coasts. But such is the tremendous power of\r\nthe Atlantic billows when impelled by westerly winds, that to their\r\nagency must be mainly attributed the small size of the volcanic\r\nland-surfaces as compared with their original extent, and the formation\r\nof those grand headlands which are presented by the igneous masses of\r\nSkye, Ardnamurchan, and Mull towards the west. Rain and river action,\r\nsupplemented by that of glaciers, have also had a share in eroding\r\nchannels and wearing down the upper surface of the ground, with the\r\nresult we at present behold in the wild and broken scenery of the Inner\r\nHebrides and adjoining coast.\r\n\r\n[1] Geikie, _loc. cit._, p. 178; also _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol.\r\nxxvii. p. 303.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nISLE OF STAFFA.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has been made to this remarkable island in a former page, but\r\nsome more extended notice is desirable before leaving the region of the\r\nInner Hebrides. Along with the islands of Pladda, Treshnish, and\r\nBlackmore, Staffa is one of the outlying volcanic islands of the group,\r\nbeing distant about six miles from the coast of Mull, and indicates the\r\nminimum distance to which the plateau-basaltic sheets originally\r\nextended in the direction of the old marginal lands of Tiree and Coll.\r\nThe island consists of successive sheets of bedded basaltic lava, with\r\npartings of tuff, one of which of considerable thickness is shown to lie\r\nat the base of the cliff on the south-west side of the island.[1] The\r\nsuccessive lava-sheets present great varieties of structure, like those\r\non the north coast of Antrim; some being amorphous, others columnar,\r\nwith either straight or bent columns. The lava-sheet out of which\r\nFingal's Cave is excavated consists of vertical prisms, beautifully\r\nformed, and surmounted by an amorphous mass of the same material. At the\r\nentrance of the Boat Cave we have a somewhat similar arrangement of the\r\ncolumns;[2] but at the Clam-shell Cave the prisms are curved, indicating\r\nsome movement in the viscous mass before they had been fully\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nFingal's Cave is called after the celebrated prince of Morvern (or\r\nMorven), a province of ancient Caledonia. He is supposed to have been\r\nthe father of Ossian, the Celtic bard rendered famous by Macpherson. The\r\ncave, one of many which pierce the coast-cliffs of Western Scotland, is\r\n227 feet in length, 166 feet in height, and 40 feet in width. On all\r\nsides regular columns of basalt, some entire, others broken, rise out of\r\nthe water and support the roof. The cave is only accessible in calm\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[1] A drawing of this cliff is given by Geikie in the _Manual of\r\nGeology_ (Jukes and Geikie), 3rd edition, p. 277.\r\n\r\n[2] Prestwich, _Geology_, vol. i. p. 281, where a view of this cave is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nPRE-TERTIARY VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DECCAN TRAP-SERIES OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great outpourings of augitic lava of Tertiary and recent times which\r\nwe have been considering appear to have been anticipated in several\r\nparts of the world, more especially in Peninsular India and in Africa,\r\nand it is desirable that we should devote a few pages to the description\r\nof these remarkable volcanic formations, as they resemble, both in their\r\nmode of occurrence and general structure, some of the great lava-floods\r\nof a more recent period we have been considering. Of the districts to be\r\ndescribed, the first which claims our notice is the Deccan.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Extent of the Volcanic Plateau._--The volcanic plateau of the\r\nDeccan stretches from the borders of the Western Ghats and the sea-coast\r\nnear Bombay inland to Amarantak, at the head of the Narbudda River\r\n(long. 82° E.), and from Belgaum (lat. 15° 31' N.) to near Goona (lat.\r\n24° 30'). The vast area thus circumscribed is far from representing the\r\noriginal extent of the tract overspread by the lava-floods, as outlying\r\nfragments of these lavas are found as far east as long. 84° E. in one\r\ndirection, and at Kattiwar and Cutch in another. The present area,\r\nhowever, is estimated to be not less than 200,000 square miles.[1]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Nature and Thickness of the Lava-flows._--This tract is\r\noverspread almost continuously by sheets of basaltic lava, with\r\noccasional bands of fresh-water strata containing numerous shells,\r\nfigured and described by Hislop, and believed by him to be of Lower\r\nEocene age. The lava-sheets vary considerably in character, ranging from\r\nfinest compact basalt to coarsely crystalline dolerite, in which olivine\r\nis abundant. The columnar structure is not prevalent, the rock being\r\neither amorphous, or weathering into concentric shells. Volcanic ash, or\r\nbole, is frequently found separating the different lava-flows; and in\r\nthe upper amygdaloidal sheets numerous secondary minerals are found,\r\nsuch as quartz, agate and jasper, stilbite and chlorite. The total\r\nthickness of the whole series, where complete, is about 6,000 feet,\r\ndivided as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Upper trap; with ash and inter-trappean beds    1,500 feet\r\n2. Middle trap; sheets of basalt and ash           4,000  \"\r\n3. Lower trap; basalt with inter-trappean beds       500  \"\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                   6,000  \"\r\n                                                   ========\r\n\r\nThroughout the region here described these great sheets of volcanic rock\r\nare everywhere approximately horizontal, and constitute a table-land of\r\n3,000 to 4,000 feet in elevation, breaking off in terraced escarpments,\r\nand penetrated by deep river-valleys, of which the Narbudda is the most\r\nimportant. The foundation rock is sometimes metamorphic schist, or\r\ngneiss, at other times sandstone referred by Hislop to Jurassic age; and\r\nin no single instance has a volcanic crater or focus of eruption been\r\nobserved. But outside the central trappean area volcanic foci are\r\nnumerous, as in Cutch, the Rajhipla Hills and the Lower Narbudda valley.\r\nThe original excessive fluidity of the Deccan trap is proved by the\r\nremarkable horizontality of the beds over large areas, and the extensive\r\nregions covered by very thin sheets of basalt or dolerite.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Geological Age._--As regards the geological age of this great\r\nvolcanic series much uncertainty exists, owing to the absence of marine\r\nforms in the inter-trappean beds. One single species, _Cardita\r\nvariabilis_, has been observed as occurring in these beds, and in the\r\nlimestone below the base of the trap at Dudukur. The _facies_ of the\r\nforms in this limestone is Tertiary; but there is a remarkable absence\r\nof characteristic genera. On the other hand, Mr. Blanford states that\r\nthe bedded traps are seen to underlie the Eocene Tertiary strata with\r\n_Nummulites_ in Guzerat and Cutch,[2] which would appear to determine\r\nthe limit of their age in one direction. On balancing the evidence,\r\nhowever, it is tolerably clear that the volcanic eruptions commenced\r\ntowards the close of the Cretaceous period, and continued into the\r\ncommencement of the Tertiary, thus bridging over the interval between\r\nthe two epochs; and since the greater sheets have been exposed\r\nthroughout the whole of the Tertiary and Quarternary periods, it is not\r\nsurprising if they have suffered enormously from denuding agencies, and\r\nthat any craters or cones of eruption that may once have existed have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[1] The Deccan Traps have been described by Sykes, _Geol.

Nor are\r\nthese tracts so widely separated that they may not be considered as\r\nportions of one great volcanic area extending from Abyssinia, through\r\nSouthern Arabia, into Cutch and the Deccan, in the one direction, while\r\nthe great volcanic cones of Kenia and Kilimanjaro, with their\r\nsurrounding tracts of volcanic matter, may be the extreme prolongations\r\nin the other. Along this tract volcanic operations are still active in\r\nthe Gulf of Aden; and cones quite unchanged in form, and evidently of\r\nvery recent date, abound in many places along the coast both of Arabia\r\nand Africa. The volcanic formations of this tract are, however, much\r\nmore recent than those which occupy the high plateaux of Central and\r\nSouthern Abyssinia of which we are about to speak.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Physical Features._--Abyssinia forms a compact region of lofty\r\nplateaux intersected by deep valleys, interposed between the basin of\r\nthe Nile on the west, and the low-lying tract bordering the Red Sea and\r\nthe Indian Ocean on the east. The plateaux are deeply intersected by\r\nvalleys and ravines, giving birth to streams which feed the head waters\r\nof the Blue Nile (Bahr el Arak) and the Atbara. Several fine lakes lie\r\nin the lap of the mountains, of which the Zana, or Dembia, is the\r\nlargest, and next Ashangi, visited by the British army on its march to\r\nMagdala in 1868, and which, from its form and the volcanic nature of the\r\nsurrounding hills, appears to occupy the hollow of an extinct crater.\r\nThe table-land of Abyssinia reaches its highest elevation along the\r\neastern and southern margin, where its average height may be 8,000 to\r\n10,000 feet; but some peaks rise to a height of 12,000 to 15,000 feet in\r\nShoa and Ankobar.[1]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Basaltic Lava Sheets._--An enormous area of this country seems\r\nto be composed of volcanic rocks chiefly in the form of sheets of\r\nbasaltic lava, which rise into high plateaux, and break off in\r\nsteep--sometimes precipitous--mural escarpments along the sides of the\r\nvalleys. These are divisible into the following series:--\r\n\r\n(1) _The Ashangi Volcanic Series._--The earliest forerunners of the more\r\nrecent lavas seem to have been erupted in Jurassic times, in the form of\r\nsheets of contemporaneous basalt or dolerite amongst the Antola\r\nlimestones which are of this period. But the great mass of the volcanic\r\nrocks are much more recent, and may be confidently referred to the late\r\nCretaceous or early Tertiary epochs. Their resemblance to the great\r\ntrappean series of Western India, even in minute particulars, is\r\nreferred to by Mr. Blanford, who suggests the view that they belong to\r\none and the same great series of lava-flows extruded over the surface of\r\nthis part of the globe. This view is inherently probable. They consist\r\nof basalts and dolerites, generally amygdaloidal, with nodules of agate\r\nand zeolite, and are frequently coated with green-earth (chlorite). Beds\r\nof volcanic ash or breccia also frequently occur, and often contain\r\naugite crystals. At Senafé, hills of trachyte passing into claystone and\r\nbasalt were observed by Mr. Blanford, but it is not clear what are their\r\nrelations to the plateau-basaltic sheets.[2]\r\n\r\n(2) _Magdala Volcanic Series._--This is a more recent group of volcanic\r\nlavas, chiefly distinguished from the lower, or Ashangi, group, by the\r\noccurrence of thick beds of trachyte, usually more or less crystalline,\r\nand containing beautiful crystals of sanidine. The beds of trachyte\r\nbreak off in precipitous scarps, and being of great thickness and\r\nperfectly horizontal, are unusually conspicuous. Mr. Blanford says, with\r\nregard to this group, that there is a remarkable resemblance in its\r\nphysical aspect to the scenery of the Deccan and the higher valleys of\r\nthe Western Ghats of India, but the peculiarities of the landscape are\r\nexaggerated in Abyssinia. Many of the trachytic beds are brecciated and\r\nhighly columnar; sedimentary beds are also interstratified with those of\r\nvolcanic origin. The Magdala group is unconformable to that of Ashangi\r\nin some places. A still more recent group of volcanic rocks appears to\r\noccur in the neighbourhood of Senafé, consisting of amorphous masses of\r\ntrachyte, often so fine-grained and compact as to pass into claystone\r\nand to resemble sandstone. At Akub Teriki the rocks appear to be in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of an ancient vent of eruption.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be apparent that Abyssinia offers\r\nvolcanic phenomena of great interest for the observer. There is\r\nconsiderable variety in the rock masses, in their mode of distribution,\r\nand in the scenery which they produce. The extensive horizontal sheets\r\nof lava are suggestive of fissure-eruption rather than of eruption\r\nthrough volcanic craters; and although these may have once been in\r\nexistence, denudation has left no vestiges of them at the present day.\r\nIn all these respects the resemblance of the volcanic phenomena to those\r\nof Peninsular India is remarkably striking; it suggests the view that\r\nthey are contemporaneous as regards the time of their eruption, and\r\nsimilar as regards their mode of formation.\r\n\r\n[1] W. T. Blanford, _Geology of Abyssinia_, pp. 151-2.\r\n\r\n[2] Blanford, _loc. cit._, p. 182.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCAPE COLONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basalt of the Plateau._--The extensive sheets of plateau-basalt forming\r\nportions of the Neuweld range and the elevated table-land of Cape\r\nColony, may be regarded as forerunners of those just described, and\r\npossibly contemporaneous with the Ashangi volcanic series of Abyssinia.\r\nThe great basaltic sheets of the Cape Colony are found capping the\r\nhighest elevations of the Camderboo and Stormberg ranges, as well as\r\noverspreading immense areas of less elevated land, to an extent,\r\naccording to Professor A. H. Green, of at least 120,000 square miles.[1]\r\nAmongst these sheets, innumerable dykes, and masses of solid lava which\r\nfilled the old vents of eruption, are to be observed. The floor upon\r\nwhich the lava-floods have been poured out generally consists of the\r\n\"Cave Sandstone,\" the uppermost of a series of deposits which had\r\npreviously been laid down over the bed of an extensive lake which\r\noccupied this part of Africa during the Mesozoic period. After the\r\ndeposition of this sandstone, the volcanic forces appear to have burst\r\nthrough the crust, and from vents and fissures great floods of augitic\r\nlava, with beds of tuff, invaded the region occupied by the waters of\r\nthe lake. The lava-sheets have since undergone extensive denudation, and\r\nare intersected by valleys and depressions eroded down through them into\r\nthe sandstone floor beneath; and though the precise geological period at\r\nwhich they were extruded must remain in doubt, it appears probable that\r\nthey may be referred to that of the Trias.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] Green. \"On the Geology of the Cape Colony,\" _Quart. Jour. Geol.\r\nSoc._, vol. xliv. (1888).\r\n\r\n[2] The district lying along the south coast of Africa is described by\r\nAndrew G. Bain, in the _Trans. Geol. Soc._, vol. vii. (1845); but there\r\nis little information regarding the volcanic region here referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ROCKS OF PAST GEOLOGICAL PERIODS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of this work to describe the volcanic rocks of\r\npre-Tertiary times over various parts of the globe. The subject is far\r\ntoo large to be treated otherwise than in a distinct and separate essay.\r\nI will therefore content myself with a brief enumeration of the\r\nformations of the British Isles in which contemporaneous volcanic action\r\nhas been recognised.[1]\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence of volcanic action throughout the long lapse of\r\ntime extending backwards from the Cretaceous to the Triassic epochs,\r\nthat is to say, throughout the Mesozoic or Secondary period, and it is\r\nnot till we reach the Palæozoic strata that evidence of volcanic action\r\nunmistakably presents itself.\r\n\r\n_Permian Period._--In Ayrshire, and in the western parts of Devonshire,\r\nbeds of felspathic porphyry, felstone and ash are interstratified with\r\nstrata believed to be of Permian age. In Devonshire these have only\r\nrecently been recognised by Dr. Irving and the author as of Permian age,\r\nthe strata consisting of beds of breccia, lying at the base of the New\r\nRed Sandstone. Those of Ayrshire have long been recognised as of the\r\nsame period; as they rest unconformably on the coal measures, and\r\nconsist of porphyrites, melaphyres, and tuffs of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous Period._--Volcanic rocks occur amongst the coal-measures\r\nof England and Scotland, while they are also found interbedded with the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series in Derbyshire, Scotland, and Co. Limerick\r\nin Ireland. The rocks consist chiefly of basalt, dolerite, melaphyre and\r\nfelstone.\r\n\r\n_Devonian Period._--Volcanic rocks of Devonian age occur in the South of\r\nScotland, consisting of felstone-porphyries and melaphyres; also at\r\nBoyle, in Roscommon, and amongst the Glengariff beds near Killarney in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n_Upper Silurian Period._--Volcanic rocks of this stage are only known in\r\nIreland, on the borders of Cos. Mayo and Galway, west of Lough Mask, and\r\nat the extreme headland of the Dingle Promontory in Co. Kerry. They\r\nconsist of porphyrites, felstones and tuffs, or breccias,\r\ncontemporaneously erupted during the Wenlock and Ludlow stages. Around\r\nthe flanks of Muilrea, beds of purple quartz-felstone with tuff are\r\ninterstratified with the Upper Silurian grits and slates.\r\n\r\n_Lower Silurian Period._--Volcanic action was developed on a grand scale\r\nduring the Arenig and Caradoc-Bala stages, both in Wales and the Lake\r\ndistrict, and in the Llandeilo stage in the South of Scotland. The\r\nfelspathic lavas, with their associated beds of tuff and breccia, rise\r\ninto some of the grandest mountain crests of North Wales, such as those\r\nof Cader Idris, Aran Mowddwy, Arenig and Moel Wyn. A similar series is\r\nalso represented in Ireland, ranging from Wicklow to Waterford, forming\r\na double group of felstones, porphyries, breccias, and ash-beds, with\r\ndykes of basalt and dolerite. The same series again appears amidst the\r\nLower Silurian beds of Co. Louth, near Drogheda.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic Series presumably of Lower Silurian Age._--If, as seems\r\nhighly probable, the great metamorphic series of Donegal and Derry are\r\nthe representatives in time of the Lower Silurian series, some of the\r\ngreat sheets of felspathic and hornblendic trap which they contain are\r\nreferable to this epoch. These rocks have undergone a change in\r\nstructure along with the sedimentary strata of which they were\r\noriginally formed, so that the sheets of (presumably) augitic lava have\r\nbeen converted into hornblende-rock and schist. Similar masses occur in\r\nNorth Mayo, south of Belderg Harbour.\r\n\r\n_Cambrian Period._--In the Pass of Llanberis, along the banks of Llyn\r\nPadarn, masses of quartz-porphyry, felsite and agglomerate, or breccia,\r\nindicate volcanic action during this stage. These rocks underlie beds of\r\nconglomerate, slate and grit of the Lower Cambrian epoch, and, as Mr.\r\nBlake has shown, are clearly of volcanic origin, and pass upwards into\r\nthe sedimentary strata of the period. A similar group, first recognised\r\nby Professor Sedgwick, stretches southwards from Bangor along the\r\nsouthern shore of the Menai Straits. Again, we find the volcanic\r\neruptions of this epoch at St. David's, consisting of diabasic and\r\nfelsitic lava, with beds of ash; and in the centre of England, amongst\r\nthe grits and slates of Charnwood Forest presumably of Cambrian age,\r\nvarious felstones, porphyries, and volcanic breccias are found.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that every epoch, from the earliest stage of the\r\nCambrian to the Permian, in the British Isles, gives evidence of the\r\nexistence of volcanic action; from which we may infer that the\r\noriginating cause, whatever it may be, has been in operation throughout\r\nall past geological time represented by living forms. The question of\r\nthe condition of our globe in Archæan times, and earlier, is one which\r\nonly can be discussed on theoretic ground, and is beyond the scope of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n[1] The reader is referred to Sir A. Geikie's Presidential Address to\r\nthe Geological Society (1891) for the latest view of this subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLCANIC BAND OF THE MOLUCCAS.\r\nMap showing the volcanic belt to which Krakatoa belongs. The shaded\r\nportion is volcanic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL VOLCANIC AND SEISMIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA IN 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose to introduce here some account of one of the most terrible\r\noutbursts of volcanic action that have taken place in modern times;\r\nnamely, the eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa (a corruption of Rakata)\r\nin the strait of Sunda, between the islands of Sumatra and Java, in the\r\nyear 1883. The Malay Archipelago, of which this island once formed a\r\nmember, is a region where volcanic action is constant, and where the\r\noutbursts are exceptionally violent. With the great island of Borneo as\r\na solid, non-volcanic central core, a line of volcanic islands extends\r\nfrom Chedooba off the coast of Pegu through Sumatra, Java, Sumbawa,\r\nFlores, and, reaching the Moluccas, stretches northwards through the\r\nPhilippines into Japan and Kamtschatka. This is probably the most active\r\nvolcanic belt in the world, and the recent terrible earthquake and\r\neruption in Japan (November, 1891) gives proof that the volcanic forces\r\nare as powerful and destructive as ever.[1]\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Dormant Condition down to 1680._--Down to the year 1680, this\r\nisland, although from its form and structure evidently volcanic, appears\r\nto have been in a dormant state; its sides were covered with luxuriant\r\nforests, and numerous habitations dotted its shore. But in May of that\r\nyear an eruption occurred, owing to which the aspect of Krakatoa as\r\ndescribed by Vogel was entirely changed; the surface of the island when\r\nthis writer passed on his voyage to Sumatra appeared burnt up and arid,\r\nwhile blocks of incandescent rock were being hurled into the air from\r\nfour distinct points. After this first recorded eruption the island\r\nrelapsed into a state of repose, and except for a stream of molten lava\r\nwhich issued from the northern extremity, there was no evidence of its\r\ndangerous condition. The luxuriant vegetation of the tropics speedily\r\nre-established itself, and the volcano was generally regarded as\r\n\"extinct.\"[2] History repeats itself; and the history of Vesuvius was\r\nrepeated in the case of Krakatoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Map Of The Krakatoa Group Of Islands Before\r\nThe Eruption Of August 1883 (From Admiralty Chart)]\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Eruption of May, 1883._[3]--On the morning of May 20, 1883, the\r\ninhabitants of Batavia, of Buitenzorg, and neighbouring localities, were\r\nsurprised by a confused noise, mingled with detonations resembling the\r\nfiring of artillery. The phenomena commenced between ten and eleven\r\no'clock in the morning, and soon acquired such intensity as to cause\r\ngeneral alarm. The detonations were accompanied by tremblings of the\r\nground, of buildings and various objects contained in dwellings; but it\r\nwas generally admitted that these did not proceed from earthquake\r\nshocks, but from atmospheric vibrations. No deviation of the magnetic\r\nneedle was observed at the Meteorological Institute of Batavia; but a\r\nvertical oscillation was apparent, and persons who listened with the ear\r\nplaced on the ground, even during the most violent detonations, could\r\nhear no subterranean noise whatever. It became clear that the sounds\r\ncame from some volcano burst into activity; but it is strange that for\r\ntwo whole days it remained uncertain what was the particular volcano to\r\nwhich the phenomena were to be referred. The detonations appeared,\r\nindeed, to come from the direction of Krakatoa; but from Serang, Anjer,\r\nand Merak, localities situated much nearer Krakatoa than Batavia, the\r\ntelegraph announced that neither detonations nor atmospheric vibrations\r\nhad been perceived. The distance between Batavia and Krakatoa is\r\nninety-three English miles. The doubts thus experienced were, however,\r\nsoon put to rest by the arrival of an American vessel under the command\r\nof A. R. Thomas, and of other ships which hailed from the straits of\r\nSunda. From their accounts it was ascertained that in the direction of\r\nKrakatoa the heavens were clouded with ashes, and that a grand column of\r\nsmoke, illumined from time to time by flashes of flame, arose from above\r\nthe island. Thus after a repose of more than two hundred years, \"the\r\npeaceable isle of Krakatoa, inhabited, and covered by thick forests, was\r\nsuddenly awakened from its condition of fancied security.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Section from Verlaten Island through Krakatoa,\r\nto show the outline before and after the eruption of August, 1888. The\r\ncontinuous line shows the former; the dotted line and shading, the\r\nlatter; from which it will be observed that the original island has to a\r\nlarge extent disappeared. The line of section is shown in Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Form and Appearance of the Island before the Eruption of\r\n1883._--From surveys made in 1849 and 1881, it would appear that the\r\nisland of Krakatoa consisted of three mountains or groups of mountains\r\n(Figs. 35, 36); the southern formed by the cone of Rakata (properly so\r\ncalled), rising with a scarped face above the sea to a height of over\r\n800 mètres (2,622 feet). Adjoining this cone, and rising from the centre\r\nof the island, came the group of Danan, composed of many summits,\r\nprobably forming part of the _enceinte annulaire_ of a crater. And near\r\nthe northern extremity of the isle, a third group of mammelated heights\r\ncould be recognised under the general name of Perboewatan, from which\r\nissued several obsidian lava-flows, with a steep slope; these dated back\r\nperhaps to the period of the first known eruption of 1680. This large\r\nand mountainous island as it existed at the beginning of May, 1883, has\r\nbeen entirely destroyed by the terrible eruptions of that year, with the\r\nexception of the peripheric rim (composed of the most ancient of the\r\nvolcanic rocks, andesite), of which Verlaten Island and Rakata formed a\r\npart, and one very small islet, which is noted on the maps as \"rots\"\r\n(rock), and on the new map of the Straits of Sunda of the Dutch Navy as\r\nthat of \"Bootsmansrots.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAs shown by the map in the Report of the Royal Society, the group of\r\nislands which existed previous to 1883 were but the unsubmerged portions\r\nof one vast volcanic crater, built up of a remarkable variety of lava\r\nallied to the andesite of the Java volcanoes, but having a larger\r\npercentage of silica, and hence falling under the head of\r\n\"enstatite-dacite.\"[5] That these volcanic rocks are of very recent\r\norigin is shown by the fact, ascertained by Verbeek, that beneath them\r\noccur deposits of Post-Tertiary age, and that these in turn rest on the\r\nTertiary strata which are widely distributed through Sumatra, Java, and\r\nthe adjoining islands. According to the reasoning of Professor Judd, the\r\nKrakatoa group at an early period of its history presented the form of a\r\nmagnificent crater-cone, several miles in circumference at the base,\r\nwhich subsequent eruptions shattered into fragments or blew into the\r\nair in the form of dust, ashes, and blocks of lava, while the central\r\npart collapsed and fell in, leaving a vast circular ring like the\r\nancient crater of Somma (see Fig. 6, p. 43), and he supposes the former\r\neruptions to have been on a scale exceeding in magnificence those which\r\nhave caused such world-wide interest within the last few years.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Eruption of 26th to 28th of August._--It was, as we have seen,\r\nin the month of May that, in the language of Chev. Verbeek, \"the volcano\r\nof Krakatoa chose to announce in a high voice to the inhabitants of the\r\nArchipelago that, although almost nothing amongst the many colossal\r\nvolcanic mountains of the Indies, it yielded to none of them in regard\r\nto its power.\" These eruptions were, however, only premonitory of the\r\ntremendous and terrible explosion which was to commence on Sunday, the\r\n26th of August, and which continued for several days subsequently. A\r\nlittle after noon of that day, a rumbling noise accompanied by short and\r\nfeeble explosions was heard at Buitenzorg, coming from the direction of\r\nKrakatoa; and similar sounds were heard at Anjer and Batavia a little\r\nlater. Soon these detonations augmented in intensity, especially about\r\nfive o'clock in the evening; and news was afterwards received that the\r\nsounds had been heard in the isle of Java. These sounds increased still\r\nmore during the night, so that few persons living on the west side of\r\nthe isle of Java were able to sleep. At seven in the morning there came\r\na crash so formidable, that those who had hoped for a little sleep at\r\nBuitenzorg leaped from their beds. Meanwhile the sky, which had up to\r\nthis time been clear, became overcast, so that by ten o'clock it became\r\nnecessary to have recourse to lamps, and the air became charged with\r\nvapour. Occasional shocks of earthquake were now felt. Darkness became\r\ngeneral all over the straits and the bordering coasts. Showers of ashes\r\nbegan to fall. The repeated shocks of earthquake, and the rapid\r\ndischarges of subterranean artillery, all combined to show that an\r\neruption of even greater violence than that of May was in progress at\r\nthe isle of Krakatoa.\r\n\r\nBut the most interested witnesses to this terrible outburst were those\r\non board the ships plying through the straits. Amongst these was the\r\n_Charles Bal_, a British vessel under the command of Captain Watson.\r\nThis ship was ten miles south of the volcano on Sunday afternoon, and\r\ntherefore well in sight of the island at the time when the volcano had\r\nentered upon its paroxysmal state of action. Captain Watson describes\r\nthe island as being covered by a dense black cloud, while sounds like\r\nthe discharges of artillery occurred at intervals of a second of time;\r\nand a crackling noise (probably arising from the impact of fragments of\r\nrock ascending and descending in the atmosphere) was heard by those on\r\nboard. These appearances became so threatening towards five o'clock in\r\nthe evening, that the commander feared to continue his voyage and began\r\nto shorten sail. From five to six o'clock a rain of pumice in large\r\npieces, quite warm, fell upon the ship, which was one of those that\r\nescaped destruction during this terrible night.[6]\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Electrical Phenomena._--During this eruption, electrical\r\nphenomena of great splendour were observed. Captain Wooldbridge,\r\nviewing the eruption in the afternoon of the 26th from a distance of\r\nforty miles, speaks of a great vapour-cloud looking like an immense wall\r\nbeing momentarily lighted up \"by bursts of forked lightning like large\r\nserpents rushing through the air. After sunset this dark wall resembled\r\na blood-red curtain, with edges of all shades of yellow, the whole of a\r\nmurky tinge, through which gleamed fierce flashes of lightning.\" As\r\nProfessor Judd observes, the abundant generation of atmospheric\r\nelectricity is a familiar phenomenon in all volcanic eruptions on a\r\ngrand scale. The steam-jets rushing through the orifices of the earth's\r\ncrust constitute an enormous hydro-electrical engine, and the friction\r\nof the ejected materials striking against one another in their ascent\r\nand descent also does much in the way of generating electricity.[7] It\r\nhas been estimated by several observers that the column of watery vapour\r\nascended to a height of from twelve to seventeen and even twenty-three\r\nmiles; and on reaching the upper strata of the atmosphere, it spread\r\nitself out in a vast canopy resembling \"the pine-tree\" form of Vesuvian\r\neruptions; and throughout the long night of the 27th this canopy\r\ncontinued to extend laterally, and the particles of dust which it\r\nenclosed began to descend slowly through the air.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Formation of Waves._--This tremendous outburst of volcanic\r\nforces, which to a greater or less extent influenced the entire surface\r\nof the globe, gave rise to waves which traversed both air and ocean; and\r\nin consequence of the large number of observatories scattered all over\r\nthe globe, and the excellence and delicacy of the instruments of\r\nobservation, we are put in possession of the remarkable results which\r\nhave been obtained from the collection of the observations in the hands\r\nof competent specialists. The results are related _in extenso_ in the\r\nReport of the Royal Society, illustrated by maps and diagrams, and are\r\nworthy of careful study by those interested in terrestrial phenomena. A\r\nbrief summary is all that can be given here, but it will probably\r\nsuffice to bring home to the reader the magnitude and grandeur of the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nThe vibrations or waves generated in August, 1883, at Krakatoa may be\r\narranged under three heads: (1) Atmospheric Waves; (2) Sound Waves; and\r\n(3) Oceanic Waves; which I will touch upon in the order here stated.\r\n\r\n(1) _Atmospheric Waves._--These phenomena have been ably handled by\r\nGeneral Strachey,[8] from a large number of observations extending all\r\nover the globe. From these it has been clearly established that an\r\natmospheric wave, originating at Krakatoa as a centre, expanded outwards\r\nin a circular form and travelled onwards till it became a great circle\r\nat a distance of 180 degrees from its point of origin, after which it\r\nstill advanced, but now gradually contracting to a node at the antipodes\r\nof Krakatoa; that is to say, at a point over the surface of North\r\nAmerica, situated in lat. 6° N. and long. 72° W. (or thereabout). Having\r\nattained this position, the wave was reflected or reproduced, expanding\r\noutwards for 180 degrees and travelling backwards again to Krakatoa,\r\nfrom which it again started, and returning to its original form again\r\noverspread the globe. This wonderful repetition, due to the spherical\r\nform of the earth, was observed no fewer than seven times, though with\r\nsuch diminished force as ultimately to be outside the range of\r\nobservation by the most sensitive instruments. It is one of the triumphs\r\nof modern scientific appliances that the course of such a wave,\r\ngenerated in a fluid surrounding a globe, which might be demonstrated on\r\nmathematical principles, has been actually determined by experiments\r\ncarried on over so great an area.\r\n\r\n(2) _Sound Waves._--If the sound-waves produced at the time of maximum\r\neruption were not quite as far-reaching as those of the air, they were\r\ncertainly sufficiently surprising to be almost incredible, were it not\r\nthat they rest, both as regards time and character, upon incontestible\r\nauthority. The sound of the eruption, resembling that of the discharge\r\nof artillery, was heard not only over nearly all parts of Sumatra, Java,\r\nand the coast of Borneo opposite the Straits of Sunda, but at places\r\nover two thousand miles distant from the scene of the explosions.\r\nDetailed accounts, collected with great care, are given in the Report of\r\nthe Royal Society, from which the following are selected as examples:--\r\n\r\n     1. At the port of Acheen, at the northern extremity of Sumatra,\r\n     distant 1,073 miles, it was supposed that the port was being\r\n     attacked, and the troops were put under arms.\r\n\r\n     2. At Singapore, distant 522 miles, two steamers were dispatched to\r\n     look out for the vessel which was supposed to be firing guns as\r\n     signals of distress.\r\n\r\n     3. At Bankok, in Siam, distant 1,413 miles, the report was heard on\r\n     the 27th; as also at Labuan, in Borneo, distant 1,037 miles.\r\n\r\n     4. At places in the Philippine Islands, distant about 1,450 miles,\r\n     detonations were heard on the 27th, at the time of the eruption.\r\n\r\nThe above places lie northwards of Krakatoa. In the opposite direction,\r\nwe have the following examples:--\r\n\r\n     5. At Perth, in Western Australia, distant 1,092 miles, sounds as\r\n     of guns firing at sea were heard; and at the Victorian Plains,\r\n     distant about 1,700 miles, similar sounds were heard.\r\n\r\n     6. In South Australia, at Alice's Springs, Undoolga, and other\r\n     places at distances of over 2,000 miles, the sounds of the eruption\r\n     were also heard.\r\n\r\n     7. In a westerly direction at Dutch Bay, Ceylon, distant 2,058\r\n     miles, the sounds were heard between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. on the\r\n     morning of the 27th of August.\r\n\r\n     8. Lastly, at the Chagos Islands, distant 2,267 miles, the\r\n     detonations were audible between 10 and 11 a.m. of the same day.\r\n\r\nSome of the above distances are so great that we may fail to realise\r\nthem; but they will be more easily appreciated, perhaps, if we change\r\nthe localities to our own side of the globe, and take two or three cases\r\nwith similar distances. Then, if the eruption had taken place amongst\r\nthe volcanoes of the Canaries, the detonations would have been heard at\r\nGibraltar, at Lisbon, at Portsmouth, Southampton, Cork, and probably at\r\nDublin and Liverpool; or, again, supposing the eruption had taken place\r\non the coast of Iceland, the report would have been heard all over the\r\nwestern and northern coasts of the British Isles, as well as at\r\nAmsterdam and the Hague. The enormous distance to which the sound\r\ntravelled in the case of Krakatoa was greatly due to the fact that the\r\nexplosions took place at the surface of the sea, and the sound was\r\ncarried along that surface uninterruptedly to the localities recorded; a\r\nrange of mountains intervening would have cut off the sound-wave at a\r\ncomparatively short distance from its source.\r\n\r\n(3) _Oceanic Waves._--As may be supposed, the eruption gave rise to\r\ngreat agitation of the ocean waters with various degrees of vertical\r\noscillation; but according to the conclusions of Captain Wharton,\r\nfounded on numerous data, the greatest wave seems to have originated at\r\nKrakatoa about 10 a.m. on the 27th of August, rising on the coasts of\r\nthe Straits of Sunda to a height of fifty feet above the ordinary\r\nsea-level. This wave appears to have been observed over at least half\r\nthe globe. It travelled westwards to the coast of Hindostan and Southern\r\nArabia, ultimately reaching the coasts of France and England. Eastwards\r\nit struck the coast of Australia, New Zealand, the Sandwich Islands,\r\nAlaska, and the western coast of North America; so that it was only the\r\ncontinent of North and South America which formed a barrier (and that\r\nnot absolute) to the circulation of this oceanic wave all over the\r\nglobe. The destruction to life and property caused by this wave along\r\nthe coasts of Sunda was very great. Combined with the earthquake shocks\r\n(which, however, were not very severe), the tremendous storm of wind,\r\nthe fall of ashes and cinders, and the changes in the sea-bed, it\r\nproduced in the Straits of Sunda for some time after the eruption a\r\ndisastrous transformation. Lighthouses had been swept away; all the old\r\nfamiliar landmarks on the shore were obscured by a vast deposit of\r\nvolcanic dust; the sea itself was encumbered with enormous quantities of\r\nfloating pumice, in many places of such thickness that no vessel could\r\nforce its way through them; and for months after the eruption one of the\r\nprincipal channels was greatly obstructed by two islands which had\r\narisen in its midst. The Sebesi channel was completely blocked by banks\r\ncomposed of volcanic materials, and two portions of these banks rose\r\nabove the sea as islands, which received the name of \"Steers Island\" and\r\n\"Calmeyer Island\"; but these, by the action of the waves, have since\r\nbeen completely swept away, and the materials strewn over the bed of the\r\nsea.[9]\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Atmospheric Effects._--But the face of nature, even in her most\r\nterrific and repulsive aspect, is seldom altogether unrelieved by some\r\ntraces of beauty. In contrast to the fearful and disastrous phenomena\r\njust described, is to be placed the splendour of the heavens, witnessed\r\nall over the central regions of the globe throughout a period of several\r\nmonths after the eruption of 1883, which has been ably treated by the\r\nHon. Rollo Russell and Mr. C. D. Archibald, in the Royal Society's\r\nReport.\r\n\r\nWhen the particles of lava and ashes mingled with vapour were projected\r\ninto the air with a velocity greater than that of a ball discharged from\r\nthe largest Armstrong gun, these materials were carried by the prevalent\r\ntrade-winds in a westerly direction, and some of them fell on the deck\r\nof ships sailing in the Indian Ocean as far as long. 80° E., as in the\r\ncase of the _British Empire_--on which the particles fell on the 29th of\r\nAugust, at a distance of 1,600 miles from Krakatoa. But far beyond this\r\nlimit, the finer particles of dust (or rather minute crystals of felspar\r\nand other minerals), mingled with vapour of water, were carried by the\r\nhigher currents of the air as far as the Seychelles and Africa,--not\r\nonly the East coast, but also the West, as Cape Coast Castle on the Gold\r\nCoast; to Paramaribo, Trinidad, Panama, the Sandwich Isles, Ceylon and\r\nBritish India, at all of which places during the month of September the\r\nsun assumed tints of blue or green, as did also the moon just before and\r\nafter the appearance of the stars;[10] and from the latter end of\r\nSeptember and for several months, the sky was remarkable for its\r\nmagnificent coloration; passing from crimson through purple to yellow,\r\nand melting away in azure tints which were visible in Europe and the\r\nBritish Isles; while a large corona was observed round both the sun and\r\nmoon. These beautiful sky effects were objects of general observation\r\nthroughout the latter part of the year 1883 and commencement of the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these phenomena may be briefly stated. The fine\r\nparticles, consisting for the most part of translucent crystals, or\r\nfragments of crystals, formed a canopy high up in the atmosphere, being\r\ngradually spread over both sides of the equator till it formed a broad\r\nbelt, through which the rays of the sun and moon were refracted. Towards\r\ndawn and sunset they were refracted and reflected from the facets of the\r\ncrystal, and thus underwent decomposition into the prismatic colours; as\r\ndo the rays of the sun when refracted and reflected from the particles\r\nof moisture in a rain-cloud. The subject is one which cannot be fully\r\ndealt with here, and is rather outside the scope of this work.\r\n\r\n(_h._) _Origin of the Eruption._--The ultimate cause of volcanic\r\neruptions is treated in a subsequent chapter, nor is that of Krakatoa\r\nessentially different from others. It was remarkable, however, both for\r\nthe magnitude of the forces evoked and the stupendous scale of the\r\nresulting phenomena. It is evident that water played an important part\r\nin these phenomena, though not as the prime mover;--any more than water\r\nin the boiler of a locomotive is the prime mover in the generation of\r\nthe steam. Without the fuel in the furnace the steam would not be\r\nproduced; and the amount of steam generated will be proportional to the\r\nquantity and heat of the fuel in the furnace and the quantity of water\r\nin the boiler. In the case of Krakatoa, both these elements were\r\nenormous and inexhaustible. The volcanic chimney (or system of\r\nchimneys), being situated on an island, was readily accessible to the\r\nwaters of the ocean when fissures gave them access to the interior\r\nmolten matter. That such fissures were opened we may well believe. The\r\nearthquakes which occurred at the beginning of May, and later on, on the\r\n27th of that month, may indicate movements of the crust by which water\r\ngained access. It appears that in May the only crater in a state of\r\nactivity was that of Perboewatan; in June another crater came into\r\naction, connected with Danan in the centre of the island, and in August\r\na third burst forth. Thus there was progressive activity up to the\r\ncommencement of the grand eruption of the 26th of that month.[11] During\r\nthis last paroxysmal stage, the centre of the island gave way and sunk\r\ndown, when the waters of the ocean gained free access, and meeting with\r\nthe columns of molten matter rising from below originated the prodigious\r\nmasses of steam which rose into the air.\r\n\r\n(_i._) _Cause of the Detonations._--The detonations which accompanied\r\nthe last great eruption are repeatedly referred to in all the accounts.\r\nThese may have been due, not only to the sudden explosions of steam\r\ndirectly produced by the ocean water coming in contact with the molten\r\nlava, but by dissociation of the vapour of water at the critical point\r\nof temperature into its elements of oxygen and hydrogen; the reunion of\r\nthese elements at the required temperature would also result in\r\nexplosions.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena attending this great volcanic eruption, so carefully\r\ntabulated and critically examined, will henceforth be referred to as\r\nconstituting an epoch in the history of volcanic action over the globe,\r\nand be of immense value for reference and comparison.\r\n\r\n[1] The eruption of Krakatoa has been the subject of an elaborate Report\r\npublished by the Royal Society, and is also described in a work by\r\nChevalier R. D. M. Verbeek, Ingenieur en Chef des Mines, and published\r\nby order of the Governor-General of the Netherland Indies (1886). See\r\nalso an Article by Sir R. S. Ball in the _Contemporary Review_ for\r\nNovember, 1888.\r\n\r\n[2] Verbeek, _loc. cit._, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[3] The account of this eruption is a free translation from Verbeek.\r\n\r\n[4] Verbeek, _loc. cit._, p. 160.\r\n\r\n[5] Judd, _Rep.

All volcanic\r\ndistricts over the globe are specially liable to vibrations of the\r\ncrust; but at the same time it is to be recollected that these movements\r\nvisit countries occasionally from which volcanoes, either recent or\r\nextinct, are absent; in which cases we may consider earthquake shocks to\r\nbe abortive attempts to originate volcanic action.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Origin._--From the numerous observations which have been made\r\nregarding the nature of these phenomena by Hopkins, Lyell, and others,\r\nit seems clearly established that earthquakes have their origin in some\r\nsudden impact of gas, steam, or molten matter impelled by gas or steam\r\nunder high pressure, beneath the solid crust.[1] How such impact\r\noriginates we need not stop to inquire, as the cause is closely\r\nconnected with that which produces volcanic eruptions. The effect,\r\nhowever, of such impact is to originate a wave of translation through\r\nthe crust, travelling outwards from the point, or focus, on the surface\r\nimmediately over the point of impact.[2] These waves of translation can\r\nin some cases be laid down on a map, and are called \"isoseismal curves,\"\r\neach curve representing approximately an equal degree of seismal\r\nintensity; as shown on the chart of a part of North America affected by\r\nthe great Charleston earthquake. (Fig. 37.) Mr. Hopkins has shown that\r\nthe earthquake-wave, when it passes through rocks differing in density\r\nand elasticity, changes in some degree not only its velocity, but its\r\ndirection; being both refracted and reflected in a manner analogous to\r\nthat of light when it passes from one medium to another of different\r\ndensity.[3] When a shock traverses the crust through a thickness of\r\nseveral miles it will meet with various kinds of rock as well as with\r\nfissures and plications of the strata, owing to which its course will be\r\nmore or less modified.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Formation of Fissures._--During earthquake movements, fissures\r\nmay be formed in the crust, and filled with gaseous or melted matter\r\nwhich may not in all cases reach the surface; and, on the principle that\r\nvolcanoes are safety-valves for regions beyond their immediate\r\ninfluence, we may infer that the earthquake shock, which generally\r\nprecedes the outburst of a volcano long dormant, finds relief by the\r\neruption which follows; so that whatever may be the extent of the\r\ndisastrous results of such an eruption, they would be still more\r\ndisastrous if there had been no such safety-valve as that afforded by a\r\nvolcanic vent. Thus, probably, owing to the extinction of volcanic\r\nactivity in Syria, the earthquakes in that region have been peculiarly\r\ndestructive. For example, on January 1, 1837, the town of Safed west of\r\nthe Jordan valley was completely destroyed by an earthquake in which\r\nmost of the inhabitants perished. The great earthquakes of Aleppo in the\r\npresent century, and of Syria in the middle of the eighteenth, were of\r\nexceptional severity. In that of Syria, which took place in 1759, and\r\nwhich was protracted during a period of three months, an area of 10,000\r\nsquare leagues was affected. Accon, Saphat, Baalbeck, Damascus, Sidon,\r\nTripoli, and other places were almost entirely levelled to the ground;\r\nmany thousands of human beings lost their lives.[4] Other examples might\r\nbe cited.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Earthquake Waves._--We have now to return to the phenomena\r\nconnected with the transmission of earthquake-waves. The velocity of\r\ntransmission through the earth is very great, and several attempts have\r\nbeen made to measure this velocity with accuracy. The most valuable of\r\nsuch attempts are those connected with the Charleston and Riviera\r\nshocks. Fortunately, owing to the perfection of modern appliances, and\r\nthe number of observers all over the globe, these results are entitled\r\nto great confidence. The phenomena connected with the Charleston\r\nearthquake, which took place on the 31st of August, 1886, are described\r\nin great detail by Captain Clarence E. Dutton, of the U.S. Ordnance\r\nCorps.[5] The conclusions arrived at are;--that as regards the depth of\r\nthe focal point, this is estimated at twelve miles, with a probable\r\nerror of less than two miles; while, as regards the rate of travel of\r\nthe earthquake-wave, the estimate is (in one case) about 3.236 miles per\r\nsecond; and in another about 3.226 miles per second.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the case of the earthquake of the Riviera, which\r\ntook place on the 23rd of February, 1887, at 5.30 a.m. (local time), the\r\nvibrations of which appear to have extended across the Atlantic, and to\r\nhave sensibly affected the seismograph in the Government Signal Office\r\nat Washington, the rate of travel was calculated at about 500 miles per\r\nhour, less than one-half that determined in the case of Charleston; but\r\nCaptain Dutton claims, and probably with justice, that the results\r\nobtained in the latter case are far more reliable than any hitherto\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Oceanic Waves._--When the originating impact takes place under\r\nthe bed of the ocean--either by a sudden up-thrust of the crust to the\r\nextent, let us suppose, of two or three feet, or by an explosion from a\r\nsubmarine volcano--a double wave is formed, one travelling through the\r\ncrust, the other through the ocean; and as the rate of velocity of the\r\nformer is greatly in excess of that of the latter, the results on their\r\nreaching the land are often disastrous in the extreme. It is the\r\nocean-wave, however, which is the more important, and calls for special\r\nconsideration. If the impact takes place in very deep water, the whole\r\nmass of the water is raised in the form of a low dome, sloping equally\r\naway in all directions; and it commences to travel outwards as a wave\r\nwith an advancing crest until it approaches the coast and enters shallow\r\nwater. The wave then increases in height, and the water in front is\r\ndrawn in and relatively lowered; so that on reaching a coast with a\r\nshelving shore the form of the surface consists of a trough in front\r\nfollowed by an advancing crest. These effects may be observed on a small\r\nscale in the case of a steamship advancing up a river, or into a harbour\r\nwith a narrow channel, but are inappreciable in deep water, or along a\r\nprecipitous open coast.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _The Earthquake of Lisbon, 1755._--The disastrous results of a\r\nsubmarine earthquake upon the coast have never been more terribly\r\nillustrated than in the case of the earthquake of Lisbon which took\r\nplace on November 1, 1755. The inhabitants had no warning of the coming\r\ndanger, when a sound like that of thunder was heard underground, and\r\nimmediately afterwards a violent shock threw down the greater part of\r\ntheir city; this was the land-wave. In the course of about six minutes,\r\nsixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired and left the\r\nharbour dry, so forming the trough in front of the crest; immediately\r\nafter the water rolled in with a lofty crest, some 50 feet above the\r\nordinary level, flooding the harbour and portions of the city bordering\r\nthe shore. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and\r\nCintra, were impetuously shaken, as it were, from their very\r\nfoundations; and according to the computation of Humboldt, a portion of\r\nthe earth's surface four times the extent of Europe felt the effects of\r\nthis great seismic shock, which extended to the Alps, the shores of the\r\nBaltic, the lakes of Scotland, the great lakes of North America, and\r\nthe West Indian Islands. The velocity of the sea-wave was estimated at\r\nabout 20 miles per minute.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Earthquake of Lima and Callao, 28th October, 1746._--Of somewhat\r\nsimilar character was the terrible catastrophe with which the cities of\r\nLima and Callao were visited in the middle of the last century,[6] in\r\nwhich the former city, then one of great magnificence, was overthrown;\r\nand Callao was inundated by a sea-wave, in which out of 23 ships of all\r\nsizes in the harbour the greater number foundered; several, including a\r\nman-of-war, were lifted bodily and stranded, and all the inhabitants\r\nwith the exception of about two hundred were drowned. A volcano in\r\nLucanas burst forth the same night, and such quantities of water\r\ndescended from the cone that the whole country was overflowed; and in\r\nthe mountain near Pataz, called Conversiones de Caxamarquilla, three\r\nother volcanoes burst forth, and torrents of water swept down their\r\nsides. In the case of these cities, the land-wave, or shock, preceded\r\nthe sea-wave, which of course only reached the port of Callao.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--The lines represent isoseismal curves, or\r\ncurves of equal intensity, the force decreasing outwards from the focus\r\nat Charleston, No. 10.]\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Earthquake of Charleston, 31st August, 1886._--I shall close\r\nthis account of some remarkable earthquakes with a few facts regarding\r\nthat of Charleston, on the Atlantic seaboard of Carolina.[7] At 9.51\r\na.m. of this day, the inhabitants engaged in their ordinary occupations\r\nwere startled by the sound of a distant roar, which speedily deepened in\r\nvolume so as to resemble the noise of cannon rattling along the road,\r\n\"spreading into an awful noise, that seemed to pervade at once the\r\ntroubled earth below and the still air above.\" At the same time the\r\nfloors began to heave underfoot, the walls visibly swayed to and fro,\r\nand the crash of falling masonry was heard on all sides, while\r\nuniversal terror took possession of the populace, who rushed into the\r\nstreets, the black portion of the community being the most demonstrative\r\nof their terror. Such was the commencement of the earthquake, by which\r\nnearly all the houses of Charleston were damaged or destroyed, many of\r\nthe public buildings seriously injured or partially demolished. The\r\neffects were felt all over the States as far as the great lakes of\r\nCanada and the borders of the Rocky Mountains. Two epicentral _foci_\r\nappear to have been established; one lying about 15 miles to the N.W. of\r\nCharleston, called the _Woodstock focus_; the other about 14 miles due\r\nwest of Charleston, called the _Rantowles focus_; around each of these\r\n_foci_ the isoseismic curves concentrated,[8] but in the map (Fig. 37)\r\nare combined into the area of one curve. The position of these _foci_\r\nclearly shows that the origin of the Charleston earthquake was not\r\nsubmarine, though occurring within a short distance of the Atlantic\r\nborder; the curves of equal intensity (isoseismals) are drawn all over\r\nthe area influenced by the shock.\r\n\r\nAs a general result of these detailed observations, Captain Dutton\r\nstates that there is a remarkable coincidence in the phenomena with\r\nthose indicated by the theory of wave-motion as the proper one for an\r\nelastic, nearly homogeneous, solid medium, composed of such materials as\r\nwe know to constitute the rocks of the outer portions of the earth; but\r\non the other hand he states that nothing has been disclosed which seems\r\nto bring us any nearer to the precise nature of the forces which\r\ngenerated the disturbance.[9]\r\n\r\n[1] The views of Mr. R. Mallet, briefly stated, are somewhat as\r\nfollows:--Owing to the secular cooling of the earth, and the consequent\r\nlateral crushing of the surface, this crushing from time to time\r\novercomes the resistance; in which case shocks are experienced along the\r\nlines of fracture and faulting by which the crust is intersected. These\r\nshocks give rise to earthquake waves, and as the crushing of the walls\r\nof the fissure developes heat, we have here the _vera causa_ both of\r\nvolcanic eruptions and earthquake shocks--the former intensified into\r\nexplosions by access of water through the fissures.--\"On the Dynamics of\r\nEarthquakes,\" _Trans.

The universality of these phenomena all over the surface of our\r\nglobe, in past or present times, indicates the existence of a general\r\ncause beneath the crust. It is true that there are to be found large\r\ntracts from which volcanic rocks (except those of great geological\r\nantiquity) are absent, such as Central Russia, the Nubian Desert, and\r\nthe Central States of North America; but such absence by no means\r\nimplies the non-existence of the forces which give rise to volcanic\r\naction beneath those regions, but only that the forces have not been\r\nsufficiently powerful to overcome the resistance offered by the crust\r\nover those particular tracts. On the other hand, the similarity of\r\nvolcanic lavas over wide regions is strong evidence that they are drawn\r\nfrom one continuous magma, consisting of molten matter beneath the\r\nsolid exterior crust.\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Lines of Volcanic Action._--It has been shown in a previous page\r\nthat volcanic action of recent or Tertiary times has taken place mainly\r\nalong certain lines which may be traced on the surface of a map or\r\nglobe. One of these lines girdles the whole globe, while others lie in\r\ncertain directions more or less coincident with lines of flexure,\r\nplication or faulting. The Isle of Sumatra offers a remarkable example\r\nof the coincidence of such lines with those of volcanic vents. Not only\r\nthe great volcanic cones, but also the smaller ones, are disposed in\r\nchains which run parallel to the longitudinal axis of the island\r\n(N.W.-S.E.). The sedimentary rocks are bent and faulted in lines\r\nparallel to the main axis, and also to the chains of volcanic mountains,\r\nand the observation holds good with regard to different geological\r\nperiods.[1] Another remarkable case is that of the Jordan Valley.\r\nNowhere can the existence of a great fracture and vertical displacement\r\nof the strata be more clearly determined than along this remarkable line\r\nof depression; and it is one which is also coincident with a zone of\r\nearthquake and volcanic disturbances.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Such Lines generally lie along the Borders of the Ocean._--But\r\neven where, from some special cause, actual observation on the relations\r\nof the strata are precluded, the general configuration of the ground and\r\nthe relations of the boundaries between land and sea to those of\r\nvolcanic chains, evidently point in many cases to their mutual\r\ninterdependence. The remarkable straightness of the coast of Western\r\nAmerica, and of the parallel chain of the Andes, affords presumptive\r\nevidence that this line is coincident with a fracture or system of\r\nfaults, along which the continent has been bodily raised out of the\r\nwaters of the ocean. Of this elevation within very recent times we have\r\nabundant evidence in the existence of raised coral-reefs and oceanic\r\nshell-beds at intervals all along the coast; rising in Peru to a level\r\nof no less than 3,000 feet above the ocean, as shown by Alexander\r\nAgassiz.[2] Such elevations probably occurred at a time when the\r\nvolcanoes of the Andes were much more active than at present. Considered\r\nas a whole, these great volcanic mountains may be regarded as in a\r\ndormant, or partially moribund, condition; and if the volcanic forces\r\nhave to some extent lost their strength, so it would appear have those\r\nof elevation.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Areas of Volcanic Action in the British Isles._--In the case of\r\nthe British Islands it may be observed that the later Tertiary volcanic\r\ndistricts lie along very ancient depressions, which may indicate zones\r\nof weakness in the crust. Thus the Antrim plateau, as originally\r\nconstituted, lay in the lap of a range of hills formed of crystalline,\r\nor Lower Silurian, rocks; while the volcanic isles of the Inner Hebrides\r\nwere enclosed between the solid range of the Archæan rocks of the Outer\r\nHebrides on the one side, and the Silurian and Archæan ranges of the\r\nmainland on the other. And if we go back to the Carboniferous period, we\r\nfind that the volcanic district of the centre of Scotland was bounded by\r\nranges of solid strata both to the north and south, where the resistance\r\nto interior pressure from molten matter would have been greater than in\r\nthe Carboniferous hollow-ground, where such molten matter has been\r\nabundantly extruded. In all these cases, the outflow of molten matter\r\nwas in a direction somewhat parallel to the plications of the strata.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Special Conditions under which the Volcanic Action\r\noperates._--Assuming, then, that the molten matter, forming an interior\r\nmagma or shell, is constantly exerting pressure against the inner\r\nsurface of the solid crust, and can only escape where the crust is too\r\nweak (owing to faults, plications, or fissures) to resist the pressure,\r\nwe have to inquire what are the special conditions under which outbursts\r\nof volcanic matter take place, and what are the general results as\r\nregards the nature of the _ejecta_ dependent on those conditions.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Effect of the Presence or Absence of Water._--The two chief\r\nconditions determining the nature of volcanic products, considered in\r\nthe mass, are the presence or absence of water. Such presence or absence\r\ndoes not of course affect the essential chemical composition of the\r\n_ejecta_, but it materially influences the form in which the matter is\r\nerupted. The agency of water in volcanic eruptions is a very interesting\r\nand important subject in connection with the history of volcanic action,\r\nand has been ably treated by Professor Prestwich.[3] At one time it was\r\nconsidered that water was essential to volcanic activity; and the fact\r\nthat the great majority of volcanic cones are situated in the vicinity\r\nof the oceanic waters, or of inland seas, was pointed to in confirmation\r\nof this theory. But the existence in Western America and other volcanic\r\ncountries of fissures of eruption along which molten lava has been\r\nextruded without explosions of steam, shows that water is not an\r\nessential factor in the production of volcanic phenomena; and, as\r\nProfessor Prestwich has clearly demonstrated, it is to be regarded as an\r\nelement in volcanic explosions, rather than as a prime cause of volcanic\r\naction. The main difficulty he shows to be thermo-dynamical; and\r\ncalculating the rate of increase in the elastic force of steam on\r\ndescending to greater and greater depths and reaching strata of higher\r\nand higher temperatures, as compared with the force of capillarity, he\r\ncomes to the conclusion that water cannot penetrate to depths of more\r\nthan seven or eight miles, and therefore cannot reach the seat of the\r\neruptive forces. Professor Prestwich also points out that if the\r\nextrusion of lava were due to the elastic force of vapour of water there\r\nshould be a distinct relation between the discharge of the lava and of\r\nthe vapour; whereas the result of an examination of a number of\r\nwell-recorded eruptions shows that the two operations are not related,\r\nand are, in fact, perfectly independent. Sometimes there has been a\r\nlarge discharge of lava, and little or no escape of steam; at other\r\ntimes there have been paroxysmal explosive eruptions with little\r\ndischarge of lava. Even in the case of Vesuvius, which is close to the\r\nsea, there have been instances when the lava has welled out almost with\r\nthe tranquillity of a water-spring.\r\n\r\n(_f._) _Access of Surface Water to Molten Lava during Eruptions._--The\r\nexistence of water during certain stages in eruptions is too frequent a\r\nphenomena to be lost sight of; but its presence may be accounted for in\r\nother ways, besides proximity to the sea or ocean. Certain volcanic\r\nmountains, such as Etna and Vesuvius, are built upon water-bearing\r\nstrata, receiving their supplies from the rainfall of the surrounding\r\ncountry, or perhaps partly from the sea. In addition to this the ashes\r\nand scoriæ of the mountain sides are highly porous, and rain or snow can\r\npenetrate and settle downwards around the pipe or throat through which\r\nmolten lava wells up from beneath. In such cases it is easy to\r\nunderstand how, at the commencement of a period of activity, molten lava\r\nascending through one or more fissures, and meeting with water-charged\r\nstrata or scoriæ, will convert the water into steam at high pressure,\r\nresulting in explosions more or less violent and prolonged, in\r\nproportion to the quantity of water and the depth to which it has\r\npenetrated. In this manner we may suppose that ashes, scoriæ, and blocks\r\nof rock torn from the sides of the crater-throat, and hurled into the\r\nair, are piled around the vent, and accumulate into hills or mountains\r\nof conical form. After the explosion has exhausted itself, the molten\r\nlava quietly wells up and fills the crater, as in the cases of those of\r\nAuvergne and Syria, and other places. We may, therefore, adopt the\r\ngeneral principle that in volcanic eruptions _where water in large\r\nquantities is present, we shall have crater-cones built up of ashes,\r\nscoriæ, and pumice; but where absent, the lava will be extravasated in\r\nsheets to greater or less distances without the formation of such cones;\r\nor if cones are fanned, they will be composed of solidified lava only,\r\neasily distinguishable from crater-cones of the first class_.\r\n\r\n(_g._) _Nature of the Interior Reservoir from which Lavas are\r\nderived._--We have now to consider the nature of the interior reservoir\r\nfrom which lavas are derived, and the physical conditions necessary for\r\ntheir eruption at the surface.\r\n\r\nWithout going back to the question of the original condition of our\r\nglobe, we may safely hold the view that at a very early period of\r\ngeological history it consisted of a solidified crust at a high\r\ntemperature, enfolding a globe of molten matter at a still higher\r\ntemperature. As time went on, and the heat radiated into space from the\r\nsurface of the globe, while at the same time slowly ascending from the\r\ninterior by conduction, the crust necessarily contracted, and pressing\r\nmore and more on the interior molten magma, this latter was forced from\r\ntime to time to break through the contracting crust along zones of\r\nweakness or fissures.\r\n\r\n(_h._) _The Earth's Crust in a State of both Exterior Thrust and of\r\nInterior Tension._--As has been shown by Hopkins,[4] and more recently\r\nby Mr. Davison,[5] an exterior crust in such a condition must eventually\r\nresult in being under a state of horizontal thrust towards the exterior\r\nand of tension towards the interior surface. For the exterior portion,\r\nhaving cooled down, and consequently contracted to its normal state,\r\nwill remain rigid up to a certain point of resistance; but the interior\r\nportion still continuing to contract, owing to the conduction of the\r\nheat towards the exterior, would tend to enter upon a condition of\r\ntension, as becoming too small for the interior molten magma; and such a\r\nstate of tension would tend to produce rupture of the interior part. In\r\nthis manner fissures would be formed into which the molten matter would\r\nenter; and if the fissures happened to extend to the surface, owing to\r\nweakness of the crust or flexuring of the strata, or other cause, the\r\nmolten matter would be extruded either in the form of dykes or volcanic\r\nvents. In this way we may account for the numerous dykes of trap by\r\nwhich some volcanic districts are intersected, such as those of the\r\nnorth of Ireland and centre of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFrom the above considerations, it follows that the earth's crust must be\r\nin a condition both of pressure (or lateral thrust) towards the exterior\r\nportion, and of tension towards the interior, the former condition\r\nresulting in faulting and flexuring of the rocks, the latter in the\r\nformation of open fissures, through which lava can ascend under high\r\npressure. These operations are of course the attempt of the natural\r\nforces to arrive at a condition of equilibrium, which is never attained\r\nbecause the processes are never completed; in other words, radiation and\r\nconvection of heat are constantly proceeding, giving rise to new forces\r\nof thrust and tension.\r\n\r\nIt now remains for us to consider what may be the condition of the\r\ninterior molten magma; and in doing so we must be guided to a large\r\nextent by considerations regarding the nature of the extruded matter at\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n(_i._) _Relative Densities of Lavas._--Now, observation shows that, as\r\nbearing on the subject under consideration, lavas occur mainly under two\r\nclasses as regards their density. The most dense (or basic) are those in\r\nwhich silica is deficient, but iron is abundant; the least dense (or\r\nacid) are those which are rich in silica, but in which iron occurs in\r\nsmall quantity. This division corresponds with that proposed by Bunsen\r\nand Durocher[6] for volcanic rocks, upon the results of analyses of a\r\nlarge number of specimens from various districts. Rocks may be thus\r\narranged in groups:\r\n\r\n     (1) _The Basic_ (Heavier)--poor in silica, rich in iron; containing\r\n                    silica 45-58 per cent. Examples: Basalt, Dolerite,\r\n                    Hornblende rock, Diorite, Diabase, Gabbro,\r\n                    Melaphyre, and Leucite lava.\r\n\r\n     (2) _The Acid_ (Lighter)--rich in silica, poor in iron; containing\r\n                    silica 62-78 per cent. Examples: Trachyte, Rhyolite,\r\n                    Obsidian, Domite, Felsite, Quartz-porphyry, Granite.\r\n\r\nThe Andesite group forms a connecting link between the highly acid and\r\nthe basic groups, and there are many varieties of the above which it is\r\nnot necessary to enumerate. Durocher supposes that the molten magmas of\r\nthese various rocks are arranged in concentric shells within the solid\r\ncrust in order of their respective densities, those of the lighter\r\ndensity, namely the acid magmas, being outside those of greater density,\r\nnamely the basic; and this is a view which seems not improbable from a\r\nconsideration not only of the principle itself, but of the succession of\r\nthe varieties of lava in many districts. Thus we find that acid lavas\r\nhave been generally extruded first, and basic afterwards--as in the\r\ncases of Western America, of Antrim, the Rhine and Central France. And\r\nif the interior of our globe had been in a condition of equilibrium from\r\nthe time of the consolidation of the crust to the present, reason would\r\ninduce us to conclude that the lavas would ultimately have arranged\r\nthemselves in accordance with the conditions of density beneath that\r\ncrust. But the state of equilibrium has been constantly disturbed. Every\r\nfresh outburst of volcanic force, and every fresh extrusion of lava,\r\ntends to disturb it, and to alter the relations of the interior viscous\r\nor molten magmas. Owing to this it happens, as we may suppose, that the\r\norder of eruption according to density is sometimes broken, and we find\r\nsuch rocks as granophyre (a variety of andesite) breaking through the\r\nplateau-basalts of Mull and Skye, as explained in a former chapter.\r\nNotwithstanding such variations, however, the view of Durocher may be\r\nconsidered as the most reasonable we can arrive at on a subject which is\r\nconfessedly highly conjectural.\r\n\r\n(_j._) _Conclusion as regards the Ultimate Cause of Volcanic\r\nAction_.--Notwithstanding, however, the complexity of the subject, and\r\nthe uncertainties which must attend an inquiry where some of the data\r\nare outside the range of our observation, sufficient evidence can be\r\nadduced to enable us to arrive at a tolerably clear view of the ultimate\r\ncause of volcanic action. So tempting a subject was sure to evoke\r\nnumerous essays, some of great ingenuity, such as that of Mr. Mallet;\r\nothers of great complexity, such as that of Dr. Daubeny. But more recent\r\nconsideration and wider observation have tended to lead us to the\r\nconclusion that the ultimate cause is the most simple, the most\r\npowerful, and the most general which can be suggested; namely, _the\r\ncontraction of the crust due to secular cooling of the more deeply\r\nseated parts by conduction and radiation of heat into space_. Owing to\r\nthis cause, the enclosed molten matter is more or less abundantly\r\nextruded from time to time along the lines and vents of eruption, so as\r\nto accommodate itself to the ever-contracting crust. Nor can we doubt\r\nthat this process has been going on from the very earliest period of the\r\nearth's history, and formerly at a greater rate than at present. When\r\nthe crust was more highly heated, the radiation and conduction must have\r\nbeen proportionately more rapid. Owing to this cause also the\r\ncontraction of the crust was accelerated. To such irresistible force we\r\nowe the wonderful flexuring, folding, and horizontal overthrusting which\r\nthe rocks have undergone in some portions of the globe--such as in the\r\nAlps, the Highlands of Scotland and of Ireland, and the Alleghannies of\r\nAmerica. It is easy to show that the acceleration of the earth's\r\nrotation must be a consequence of such contraction; but, after all, this\r\nis but one of those compensatory forces of which we see several examples\r\nin the world around us. It can also be confidently inferred that at an\r\nearly period of the earth's history, when the moon was nearer to our\r\nplanet than at present, the tides were far more powerful, and their\r\neffect in retarding the earth's rotation was consequently greater.\r\nDuring this period the acceleration due to contraction was also greater;\r\nand the two forces probably very nearly balanced each other. Both these\r\nforces (those of acceleration and retardation) have been growing weaker\r\ndown to the present day, though there appears to have been a slight\r\nadvantage on the side of the retarding force.[7]\r\n\r\n[1] R.

It is very\r\ntantalising that our beautiful satellite only permits us to look at and\r\nadmire one half of her sphere; but it is not a very far-fetched\r\ninference if we feel satisfied that the other half bears a general\r\nresemblance to that which is presented to the earth. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to inform the reader why it is that we never see but one face;\r\nstill, for the sake of those who have not thought out the subject I may\r\nstate that it is because the moon rotates on her axis exactly in the\r\ntime that she performs a revolution round the earth. If this should not\r\nbe sufficiently clear, let the reader perform a very simple experiment\r\nfor himself, which will probably bring conviction to his mind that the\r\nexplanation here given is correct. Let him place an orange in the centre\r\nof a round table, and then let him move round the table from a\r\nstarting-point sideways, ever keeping his face directed towards the\r\norange; and when he has reached his starting-point, he will find that he\r\nhas rotated once round while he has performed one revolution round the\r\ntable. In this case the performer represents the moon and the orange\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nNow this connection between the earth and her satellite is sufficiently\r\nclose to be used as an argument (if not as actual demonstration) that\r\nthe earth and the moon were originally portions of the same mass, and\r\nthat during some very early stage in the development of the solar system\r\nthese bodies parted company, to assume for ever after the relations of\r\nplanet and satellite. At the epoch referred to, we may also suppose that\r\nthese two masses of matter were in a highly incandescent, if not even\r\ngaseous, state; and we conclude, therefore, that having been once\r\nportions of the same mass, they are composed of similar materials. This\r\nconclusion is of great importance in enabling us to reason from analogy\r\nregarding the origin of the physical features on the moon's surface, and\r\nfor the purpose of comparison with those which we find on the surface of\r\nour globe; because it is evident that, if the composition of the moon\r\nwere essentially different from that of our earth, we should have no\r\nbasis whatever for a comparison of their physical features.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon started on her career of revolution round the earth, we\r\nmay well suppose that her orbit was much smaller than at present. She\r\nwas influenced by counteracting forces, those of gravitation drawing her\r\ntowards the centre of gravity of the earth,[1] and the centrifugal\r\nforce, which in the first instance was the stronger, so that her orbit\r\nfor a lengthened period gradually increased until the two forces, those\r\nof attraction and repulsion, came into a condition of equilibrium, and\r\nshe now performs her revolution round the earth at a mean distance of\r\n240,000 miles, in an orbit which is only very slightly elliptical.[2]\r\nHow the period of the moon's rotation is regulated by the earth's\r\nattraction on her molten lava-sheets, first at the surface, and now\r\nprobably below the outer crust, has been graphically shown by Sir Robert\r\nBall,[3] but it cannot be doubted that once the moon was appreciably\r\nnearer to our globe than at present. The attraction of her mass produced\r\ntides in the ocean of correspondingly greater magnitude, and capable of\r\neffecting results, both in eroding the surface and in transporting\r\nmasses of rock, far beyond the bounds of our every-day experience.\r\n\r\nOf all the heavenly bodies, the sun excepted, the moon is the most\r\nimpressive and beautiful. As we catch her form, rising as a fair\r\ncrescent in the western sky after sunset, gradually increasing in size\r\nand brilliancy night after night till from her circular disk she throws\r\na full flood of light on our world and then passes through her\r\ndecreasing phases, we recognise her as \"the Governor of the night,\" or\r\nin the words of our own poet, when in her crescent phase, \"the Diadem of\r\nnight.\" Seen through a good binocular glass, her form gains in\r\nrotundity; but under an ordinary telescope with a four-inch objective,\r\nshe appears like a globe of molten gold. Yet all this light is\r\nderivative, and is only a small portion of that she receives from the\r\nsun. That her surface is a mass of rigid matter destitute of any\r\ninherent brilliancy, appears plain enough when we view a portion of her\r\ndisk through a very large telescope. It was the good fortune of the\r\nauthor to have an opportunity for such a view through one of the largest\r\ntelescopes in the world. The 27-inch refractor manufactured by Sir\r\nHoward Grubb of Dublin, for the Vienna observatory, a few years ago, was\r\nturned on a portion of the moon's disk before being finally sent off to\r\nits destination; and seen by the aid of such enormous magnifying power,\r\nnothing could be more disappointing as regards the appearance of our\r\nsatellite. The sheen and lustre of the surface was now observed no\r\nlonger; the mountains and valleys, the circular ridges and hollows were,\r\nindeed, wonderfully defined and magnified, but the matter of which they\r\nseemed to be constituted resembled nothing so much as the pale plaster\r\nof a model. One could thus fully realise the fact that the moon's light\r\nis only derivative. Still we must recollect that the most powerful\r\ntelescope can only bring the surface of the moon to a distance from us\r\nof about 250 miles; and it need not be said that objects seen at such a\r\ndistance on our earth present very deceptive appearances; so that we\r\ngain little information regarding the composition of the moon's crust,\r\nor exterior surface, simply from observation by the aid of large\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nReasoning from analogy with our globe, we may infer that the exterior\r\nshell of the moon consists of crystalline volcanic matter of the highly\r\nsilicated, or acid, varieties resting upon another of a denser\r\ndescription, rich in iron, and resembling basalt. This hypothesis is\r\nhazarded on the supposition that the composition of the matter of the\r\nmoon's mass resembles in the main that of our globe. During the process\r\nof cooling from a molten condition, the heavier lavas would tend to fall\r\ninwards, and allow the lighter to come to the surface, and form the\r\nouter shell in both cases. Thus, the outer crust would resemble the\r\ntrachytic lavas of our globe, and their pale colour would enable the\r\nsun's rays to be reflected to a greater extent than if the material were\r\nof the blackness of basalt.[4] So much for the material. We have now to\r\nconsider the structure of the moon's surface, and here we find ourselves\r\ntreading on less speculative and safer ground. All astronomers since the\r\ntime of Schroter seem to be of accord in the opinion that the remarkable\r\nfeatures of the moon's surface are in some measure of volcanic origin,\r\nand we shall presently proceed to consider the character of these forms\r\nmore in detail.\r\n\r\nBut first, and as leading up to the discussion of these physical\r\nfeatures, we must notice one essential difference between the\r\nconstitution of the moon and of the earth; namely, the absence of water\r\nand of an atmosphere in the case of the moon. The sudden and complete\r\noccultation of the stars when the moon's disk passes between them and\r\nthe place of the observer on the earth's surface, is sufficient evidence\r\nof the absence of air; and, as no cloud has ever been noticed to veil\r\neven for a moment any part of our satellite's face, we are pretty safe\r\nin concluding that there is no water; or at least, if there be any, that\r\nit is inappreciable in quantity.[5] Hence we infer that there is no\r\nanimal or vegetable life on the moon's surface; neither are there\r\noceans, lakes or rivers, snowfields or glaciers, river-valleys or\r\ncañons, islands, stratified rocks, nor volcanoes of the kind most\r\nprevalent on our own globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Photograph of the moon's surface (in part)\r\nshowing the illuminated \"spots,\" and ridges, and the deep hollows. The\r\nposition of \"Tycho\" is shown near the upper edge, and some of the\r\nvolcanic craters are very clearly seen near the margin.]\r\n\r\nNow on looking at a photographic picture of the moon's surface (Fig.\r\n38), we observe that there are enormous dark spaces, irregular in\r\noutline, but more or less approaching the circular form, surrounded by\r\nsteep and precipitous declivities, but with sides sloping outwards.\r\nThese were supposed at one time to be seas; and they retain the name,\r\nthough it is universally admitted that they contain no water. Some of\r\nthese hollows are four English miles in depth. The largest of these,\r\nsituated near the north pole of the moon, is called _Mare Imbrium_; next\r\nto it is _Mare Serenitatis_; next, _Mare Tranquilitatis_, with several\r\nothers.[6] Mare Imbrium is of great depth, and from its floor rise\r\nseveral conical mountains with circular craters, the largest of which,\r\n_Archimedes_, is fifty miles in diameter; its vast smooth interior being\r\ndivided into seven distinct zones running east and west. There is no\r\ncentral mountain or other obvious internal sign of former volcanic\r\nactivity, but its irregular wall rises into abrupt towers, and is marked\r\noutside by decided terraces.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Mare Imbrium is bounded along the east by a range of mountains\r\ncalled the _Apennines_, and towards the north by another range called\r\nthe _Alps_; while a third range, that of the _Caucasus_, strikes\r\nnorthward from the junction of the two former ranges. Several circular\r\nor oval craters are situated on, and near to, the crest of these ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--A magnified portion of the moon's surface,\r\nshowing the forms of the great craters with their outer ramparts. The\r\nwhite spot with shadow is a cone rising from the centre of one of the\r\nlarger craters to a great height and thus becoming illuminated by the\r\nsun's light.]\r\n\r\nBut the greater part of the moon's hemisphere is dotted over by almost\r\ninnumerable circular crater-like hollows; sometimes conspicuously\r\nsurmounting lofty conical mountains, at other times only sinking below\r\nthe general outer surface of the lunar sphere. On approaching the\r\nmargin, these circular hollows appear oval in shape owing to their\r\nposition on the sphere; and the general aspect of those that are visible\r\nleads to the conclusion that there are large numbers of smaller craters\r\ntoo small to be seen by the most powerful telescopes. These cones and\r\ncraters are the most characteristic objects on the whole of the visible\r\nsurface, and when highly magnified present very rugged outlines,\r\nsuggestive of slag, or lava, which has consolidated on cooling, as in\r\nthe case of most solidified lava-streams on our earth.[8] One of the\r\nmost remarkable of these crateriform mountains is that named\r\n_Copernicus_, situated in a line with the southern prolongation of the\r\nApennines. Of this mountain Sir R. Ball says: \"It is particularly well\r\nknown through Sir John Herschel's drawing, so beautifully reproduced in\r\nthe many editions of the _Outlines of Astronomy_. The region to the west\r\nis dotted over with innumerable minute craterlets. It has a central,\r\nmany-peaked mountain about 2,400 feet in height. There is good reason to\r\nbelieve that the terracing shown in its interior is mainly due to the\r\nrepeated alternate rise, partial congealation and retreat of a vast sea\r\nof lava. At full moon it is surrounded by radiating streaks.\"[9] The\r\nview regarding the structure of Copernicus here expressed is of\r\nimportance, as it is probably applicable to all the craters of our\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\n\"When the moon is five or six days old,\" says Sir Robert Ball, \"a\r\nbeautiful group of three craters will be readily found on the boundary\r\nline between night and day. These are _Catharina_, _Cyrillus_, and\r\n_Theophilus_. Catharina is the most southerly of the group, and is more\r\nthan 16,000 feet deep and connected to Cyrillus by a wide valley; but\r\nbetween Cyrillus and Theophilus there is no such connection. Indeed\r\nCyrillus looks as if its huge surrounding ramparts, as high as Mont\r\nBlanc, had been completely finished when the volcanic forces commenced\r\nthe formation of Theophilus, the rampart of which encroaches\r\nconsiderably on its older neighbour. Theophilus stands as a well-defined\r\nround crater, about 64 miles in diameter, with an internal depth of\r\n14,000 to 18,000 feet, and a beautiful central group of mountains,\r\none-third of that height, on its floor. This proves that the last\r\neruptive efforts in this part of the moon fully equalled in intensity\r\nthose that had preceded them. Although Theophilus is on the whole the\r\ndeepest crater we can see in the moon, it has received little or no\r\ndeformation by secondary eruptions.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable object on the whole hemisphere of the\r\nmoon is \"the majestic Tycho,\" which rises from the surface near the\r\nsouth pole, and at a distance of about 1/6th of the diameter of the\r\nsphere from its margin. Its depth is stated by Ball to be 17,000 feet,\r\nand its diameter 50 miles. But its special distinction amongst the other\r\nvolcanic craters lies in the streaks of light which radiate from it in\r\nall directions for hundreds and even thousands of miles, stretching with\r\nsuperb indifference across vast plains, into the deepest craters, and\r\nover the highest opposing ridges. When the sun rises on Tycho these\r\nstreaks are invisible, but as soon as it has reached a height of 25° to\r\n30° above the horizon, the rays emerge from their obscurity, and\r\ngradually increase in brightness until full moon, when they become the\r\nmost conspicuous objects on her surface. As yet no satisfactory\r\nexplanation has been given of the origin of these illuminated rays,[10]\r\nbut I may be permitted to add that their form and mode of occurrence are\r\neminently suggestive of gaseous exhalations from the volcano illumined\r\nby the sun's rays; and owing to the absence of an atmosphere, spreading\r\nthemselves out in all directions and becoming more and more attenuated\r\nuntil they cease to be visible.\r\n\r\nThe above account will probably suffice to give the reader a general\r\nidea of the features and inferential structure of the moon's surface.\r\nThat she was once a molten mass is inferred from her globular form; but,\r\naccording to G. F. Chambers, the most delicate measurements indicate no\r\ncompression at the poles.[11] That her surface has cooled and become\r\nrigid is also a necessary inference; though Sir J. Herschel considered\r\nthat the surface still retains a temperature _possibly_ exceeding that\r\nof boiling water.[12] However this may be, it is pretty certain that\r\nwhatever changes may occur upon her surface are not due to present\r\nvolcanic action, all evidence of such action being admittedly absent.\r\nIf, when the earth and moon parted company, their respective\r\ntemperatures were equal, the moon being so much the smaller of the two\r\nwould have cooled more rapidly, and the surface may have been covered by\r\na rigid crust when as yet that of the earth may have been molten from\r\nheat. Hence the rigidity of the moon's surface may date back to an\r\nimmensely distant period, but she may still retain a high temperature\r\nwithin this crust. Having arrived at this stage of our narrative, we are\r\nin a position to consider by what means, and under what conditions, the\r\ncones and craters which diversify the lunar surface have been developed.\r\n\r\nIn doing so it may be desirable, in the first place, to determine what\r\nform of crater on our earth's surface those of the moon do not\r\nrepresent; and we are guided in our inquiry by the consideration of the\r\nabsence of water on the lunar surface. Now there are large numbers of\r\ncrateriform mountains on our globe in the formation of which water has\r\nplayed an important, indeed essential, part. As we have already seen,\r\nwater, though not the ultimate cause of volcanic eruptions, has been the\r\nchief agent, when in the form of steam at high pressure, in producing\r\nthe explosions which accompany these eruptions, and in tearing up and\r\nhurling into the air the masses of rock, scoriæ, and ashes, which are\r\npiled around the vents of eruption in the form of craters during periods\r\nof activity. To this class of craters those of Etna, Vesuvius, and\r\nAuvergne belong. These mountains and conical hills (the domes excepted)\r\nare all built up of accumulations of fragmental material, with\r\noccasional sheets and dykes of lava intervening; and where eruptions\r\nhave taken place in recent times, observation has shown that they are\r\naccompanied by outbursts of vast quantities of aqueous vapour, which has\r\nbeen the chief agent (along with various gases) in piling up the\r\ncircular walls of the crater.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown that in many instances these crater-walls have\r\nbeen breached on one side, and that streams of molten lava which once\r\noccupied the cup to a greater or less height, have poured down the\r\nmountain side. Hence the form or outline of many of these fragmental\r\ncraters is crescent-shaped. Such breached craters are to be found in all\r\nparts of the world, and are not confined to any one district, or even\r\ncontinent, so that they may be considered as characteristic of the class\r\nof volcanic crater-cones to which I am now referring. In the case of the\r\nmoon, however, we fail to observe any decided instances of breached\r\ncraters, with lava-streams, such as those I have described.[13] In\r\nnearly all cases the ramparts appear to extend continuously round the\r\nenclosed depression, solid and unbroken; or at least with no large gap\r\noccupying a very considerable section of the circumference. (See Fig.\r\n38.) Hence we are led to suspect that there is some essential\r\ndistinction between the craters on the surface of the moon and the\r\ngreater number of those on the surface of our earth.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the volcanic mountains of the moon\r\noffer no resemblance whatever to the dome-shaped volcanic mountains of\r\nour globe. If it were otherwise, the lunar mountains would appear as\r\nsimple luminous points rising from a dark floor, over which they would\r\ncast a conical shadow. But the form of the lunar volcanic mountains is\r\nessentially different; as already observed, they consist in general of a\r\ncircular rampart enclosing a depressed floor, sometimes terraced as in\r\nthe case of Copernicus, from which rise one or more conical mountains,\r\nwhich are in effect the later vents of eruption.\r\n\r\nIn our search, therefore, for analogous forms on our own earth, we must\r\nleave out the craters and domes of the type furnished by the European\r\nvolcanoes and their representatives abroad, and have recourse to others\r\nof a different type. Is there then, we may ask, any type of volcanic\r\nmountain on our globe comparable with those on the moon? In all\r\nprobability there is.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will turn to the description of the volcanoes of the\r\nHawaiian group in the Pacific, especially that of Mauna Loa, as given by\r\nProfessor Dana and others, and compare it with that of Copernicus, he\r\nwill find that in both cases we have a circular rampart of solid lava\r\nenclosing a vast plain of the same material from which rise one or more\r\nlava-cones. The interiors in both cases are terraced. So that, allowing\r\nfor differences in magnitude, it would seem that there is no essential\r\ndistinction between lunar craters and terrestrial craters of the type of\r\nMauna Loa. Dana calls these Hawaiian volcanoes \"basaltic,\" basalt being\r\nthe prevalent material of which they are formed. Those of the moon may\r\nbe composed of similar material, or otherwise; but in either case we may\r\nsuppose they are built up of lava, erupted from vents connected with the\r\nmolten reservoirs of the interior. Thus we conclude that they belong to\r\nan entirely different type, and have been built up in a different\r\nmanner, from those represented by Etna, Vesuvius, and most of the\r\nextinct volcanoes of Auvergne, the Eifel, and of other districts\r\nconsidered in these pages.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to picture to ourselves the stages through which\r\nthe moon may be supposed to have passed from the time her surface began\r\nto consolidate owing to the radiation of her heat into space; for there\r\nis every probability that some of the craters now visible on her disk\r\nwere formed at a very early period of her physical history.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface began to consolidate, it must also have contracted; and\r\nthe interior molten matter, pressed out by the contracting crust, must\r\nhave been over and over again extruded through fissures produced over\r\nthe solidified surface, until the solid crust extended over the whole\r\nlunar surface, and became of considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nIt is from this epoch that, in all probability, we should date the\r\ncommencement of what may be termed \"the volcanic history\" of the moon.\r\nWe must bear in mind that although the moon's surface had become solid,\r\nits temperature may have remained high for a very long period. But the\r\ncontinuous radiation of the surface-heat into space would produce\r\ncontinuous contraction, while the convection of the interior heat would\r\ntend to increase the thickness of the outer solid shell; and this, ever\r\npressing with increasing force on the interior molten mass, would result\r\nin frequent ruptures of the shell, and the extrusion of molten lava\r\nrising from below. Hence we may suppose the fissure-eruptions of lava\r\nwere of frequent occurrence for a lengthened period during the early\r\nstage of consolidation of the lunar crust; but afterwards these may be\r\nsupposed to have given place to eruptions through pipes or vents,\r\nresulting in the formation of the circular craters which form such\r\nstriking and characteristic objects in the physical aspect of our\r\nsatellite.[14]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the various physical features on the lunar\r\nsurface have all originated in the same way. The great ranges of\r\nmountains previously described may have originated by a process of\r\npiling up of immense masses of molten lava extruded from the interior\r\nthrough vents or fissures; while the great hollows (or \"seas\") are\r\nprobably due to the falling inwards of large spaces owing to the escape\r\nof the interior lava.\r\n\r\nBut it is with the circular craters that we are most concerned. Judging\r\nfrom analogy with the lava-craters present on our globe, we must suppose\r\nthem to be due to the extrusion, and piling up, of lava through central\r\npipes, followed in some cases by the subsidence of the floor of the\r\ncrater. It seems not improbable that it was in this way the greater\r\nnumber of the circular craters lying around Tycho, and dotting so large\r\na space round the margin of the moon, were constructed. (See Fig. 38.)\r\nIn general they appear to consist of an elevated rim, enclosing a\r\ndepressed plain, out of which a central cone arises. The rim may be\r\nsupposed to have been piled up by successive discharges of lava from a\r\ncentral orifice; and after the subsidence of the paroxysm the lava still\r\nin a molten condition may have sunk down, forming a seething lake within\r\nthe vast circular rampart, as in the case of the Hawaiian volcanoes. The\r\nterraces observable within the craters in some instances have probably\r\nbeen left by subsequent eruptions which have not attained to the level\r\nof preceding ones; and where a central crater-cone is seen to rise\r\nwithin the caldron, we may suppose this to have been built up by a later\r\nseries of eruptions of lava through the original pipe after the\r\nconsolidation of the interior sea of lava. The mamelons of the Isle of\r\nBourbon,[15] and some of the lava-cones of Hawaii, appear to offer\r\nexamples on our earth's surface of these peculiar forms.\r\n\r\nSuch are the views of the origin of the physical features of our\r\nsatellite which their form and inferred constitution appear to suggest.\r\nThey are not offered with any intention of dogmatising on a subject\r\nwhich is admittedly obscure, and regarding which we have by no means all\r\nthe necessary data for coming to a clear conclusion. All that can be\r\naffirmed is, that there is a great deal to be said in support of them,\r\nand that they are to some extent in harmony with phenomena within range\r\nof observation on the surface of our earth.\r\n\r\nThe far greater effects of lunar vulcanicity, as compared with those of\r\nour globe, may be accounted for to some extent by the consideration that\r\nthe force of gravity on the surface of the moon is only one-sixth of\r\nthat on the surface of the earth. Hence the eruptive forces of the\r\ninterior of our satellite have had less resistance to overcome than in\r\nthe case of our planet; and the erupted materials have been shot forth\r\nto greater distances, and piled up in greater magnitude, than with us.\r\nWe have also to recollect that the abrading action of water has been\r\nabsent from the moon; so that, while accumulations of matter had been\r\nproceeding throughout a prolonged period over its surface, there was no\r\ncounteracting agency of denudation at work to modify or lessen the\r\neffects of the ruptive forces.\r\n\r\n[1] Correctly speaking, each attracts the other towards its centre of\r\ngravity with a force proportionate to its mass, and inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance; but the earth being by much the larger body, its\r\nattraction is far greater than that of the moon.\r\n\r\n[2] The variation in the distance is only under rare circumstances\r\n40,000 miles, but ordinarily about 13,000 miles.\r\n\r\n[3] _Story of the Heavens_, 2nd edition, p. 525, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[4] A series of researches made by Zöllner, of Leipzig, led him to\r\nassign to the light-reflecting capacity of the full-moon a result\r\nintermediate between that obtained by Bouguer, which gave a brightness\r\nequal to 1/300000 part of that of the sun, and of Wollaston, which gave\r\n1/801070 part. We may accept 1/618000 of Zöllner as sufficiently close;\r\nso that it would require 600,000 full moons to give the same amount of\r\nlight as that of the sun.\r\n\r\n[5] Schroter, however, came to the conclusion that the moon has an\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n[6] A chart of the moon's surface, with the names of the principal\r\nphysical features, will be found in Ball's _Story of the Heavens_, 2nd\r\nedit., p. 60. It must be remembered that the moon as seen through a\r\ntelescope appears in reversed position.\r\n\r\n[7] _Ibid._, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[8] As represented by Nasmyth's models in plaster.\r\n\r\n[9] Ball, _loc. cit._, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[10] Ball, _loc. cit._, p. 69.\r\n\r\n[11] _Astronomy_, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[12] _Outlines of Astronomy_, p. 285.\r\n\r\n[13] At rare intervals a few crescent-shaped ridges are discernible on\r\nthe lunar sphere, but it is very doubtful if they are to be regarded as\r\nbreached craters.\r\n\r\n[14] The number of \"spots\" on the moon was considered to be 244 until\r\nSchroter increased it to 6,000, and accurately described many of them.\r\nSchroter seems to have been the earliest observer who identified the\r\ncircular hollows on the moon's surface as volcanic craters.\r\n\r\n[15] Drawings of these very curious forms are given by Judd,\r\n_Volcanoes_, p. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nARE WE LIVING IN AN EPOCH OF SPECIAL VOLCANIC ACTIVITY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question which we are about to discuss in the concluding chapter of\r\nthis volume is one to which we ought to be able to offer a definite\r\nanswer. This can only be arrived at by a comparison of the violence and\r\nextent of volcanic and seismic phenomena within the period of history\r\nwith those of pre-historic periods.\r\n\r\nAt first sight we might be disposed to give to the question an\r\naffirmative reply when we remember the eruptions of the last few years,\r\nand add to these the volcanic outbursts and earthquake shocks which\r\nhistory records. The cases of the earthquake and eruption in Japan of\r\nNovember, 1891, where in one province alone two thousand people lost\r\ntheir lives and many thousand houses were levelled[1]; that of Krakatoa,\r\nin 1883; of Vesuvius, in 1872; and many others of recent date which\r\nmight be named, added to those which history records;--the recollection\r\nof such cases might lead us to conclude that our epoch is one in which\r\nthe subterranean volcanic forces had broken out with extraordinary\r\nenergy over the earth's surface. Still, when we come to examine into\r\nthe cases of recorded eruptions--especially those of great violence--we\r\nfind that they are limited to very special districts; and even if we\r\nextend our retrospect into the later centuries of our era, we shall find\r\nthat the exceptionally great eruptions have been confined to certain\r\npermanently volcanic regions, such as the chain of the Andes, that of\r\nthe Aleutian, Kurile, Japanese, and Philippine and Sunda Islands, lying\r\nfor the most part along the remarkable volcanic girdle of the world to\r\nwhich I have referred in a previous page. Add to these the cases of\r\nIceland and the volcanic islands of the Pacific, and we have almost the\r\nwhole of the very active volcanoes of the world.\r\n\r\nThen for the purposes of our inquiry we have to ascertain how these\r\nactive vents of eruption compare, as regards the magnitude of their\r\noperations, with those of the pre-historic and later Tertiary times. But\r\nbefore entering into this question it maybe observed, in the first\r\nplace, that a large number of the vents of eruption, even along the\r\nchain of the earth's volcanic girdle, are dormant or extinct. This\r\nobservation applies to many of the great cones and domes of the Andes,\r\nincluding Chimborazo and other colossal mountains in Ecuador, Columbia,\r\nChili, Peru, and Mexico. The region between the eastern Rocky Mountains\r\nand the western coast of North America was, as we have seen, one over\r\nwhich volcanic eruptions took place on a vast scale in later Tertiary\r\ntimes; but one in which only the after-effects of volcanic action are at\r\npresent in operation. We have also seen that the chain of volcanoes of\r\nJapan and of the Kurile Islands are only active to a slight extent as\r\ncompared with former times, and the same observation applies to those\r\nof New Zealand. Out of 130 volcanoes in the Japanese islands, only 48\r\nare now believed to be active.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we turn to other districts we have been considering, we find\r\nthat in the Indian Peninsula, in Arabia, in Syria and the Holy Land, in\r\nPersia, in Abyssinia and Asia Minor--regions where volcanic operations\r\nwere exhibited on a grand scale throughout the Tertiary period, and in\r\nsome cases almost down into recent times--we are met by similar\r\nevidences either of decaying volcanic energy, or of an energy which, as\r\nfar as surface phenomena are concerned, is a thing of the past. Lastly,\r\nturning our attention to the European area, notwithstanding the still\r\nactive condition of Etna, Vesuvius, and a few adjoining islands, we see\r\nin all directions throughout Southern Italy evidences of volcanic\r\noperations of a past time,--such as extinct crater-cones, lakes\r\noccupying the craters of former volcanoes, and extensive deposits of\r\ntuff or streams of lava--all concurring in giving evidence of a period\r\nnow past, when vulcanicity was widespread over regions where its\r\npresence is now never felt except when some earthquake shock, like that\r\nof the Riviera, brings home to our minds the fact that the motive force\r\nis still beneath our feet, though under restrained conditions as\r\ncompared with a former period.\r\n\r\nSimilar conclusions are applicable with even greater force to other\r\nparts of the European area. The region of the Lower Rhine and Moselle,\r\nof Hungary and the Carpathians, of Central France, of the North of\r\nIreland and the Inner Hebrides, all afford evidence of volcanic\r\noperations at a former period on an extensive scale; and the contrast\r\nbetween the present physically silent and peaceful condition of these\r\nregions, as regards any outward manifestations of sub-terrestrial\r\nforces, compared with those which were formerly prevalent, cannot fail\r\nto impress our minds irresistibly with the idea that volcanic energy has\r\nwell-nigh exhausted itself over these tracts of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nFrom this general survey of the present condition of the earth's\r\nsurface, as regards the volcanic operations going on over it, and a\r\ncomparison with those of a preceding period, we are driven to the\r\nconclusion that, however violent and often disastrous are the volcanic\r\nand seismic phenomena of the present day, they are restricted to\r\ncomparatively narrow limits; and that even within these limits the\r\nvolcanic forces are less powerful than they were in pre-historic times.\r\n\r\nThe middle part of the Tertiary period appears, in fact, to have been\r\none of extraordinary volcanic activity, whether we regard the wide area\r\nover which this activity manifested itself, or the results as shown by\r\nthe great amount of the erupted materials. Many of the still active\r\nvolcanic chains, or groups, probably had their first beginnings at the\r\nperiod referred to; but in the majority of cases the eruptive forces\r\nhave become dormant or extinct. With the exception of the lavas of the\r\nIndian-Peninsular area, which appear, at least partially, to belong to\r\nthe close of the Cretaceous epoch, the specially volcanic period may be\r\nconsidered to extend from the beginning of the Miocene down to the close\r\nof the Pliocene stage. During the Eocene stage, volcanic energy appears\r\nto have been to a great degree dormant; but plutonic energy was\r\ngathering strength for the great effort of the Miocene epoch, when the\r\nvolcanic forces broke out with extraordinary violence over Europe, the\r\nBritish Isles, and other regions, and continued to develop throughout\r\nthe succeeding Pliocene epoch, until the whole globe was surrounded by a\r\ngirdle of fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reply, therefore, to the question with which we set out is very\r\nplain; and is to the effect that the present epoch is one of\r\ncomparatively low volcanic activity. The further question suggests\r\nitself, whether the volcanic phenomena of the middle Tertiary period\r\nbear any comparison with those of past geological times. This, though a\r\nquestion of great interest, is one which is far too large to be\r\ndiscussed here; and it is doubtful if we have materials available upon\r\nwhich to base a conclusion. But it may be stated with some confidence,\r\nin general terms, that the history of the earth appears to show that,\r\nthroughout all geological time, our world has been the theatre of\r\nintermittent geological activity, periods of rest succeeding those of\r\naction; and if we are to draw a conclusion regarding the present and\r\nfuture, it would be that, owing to the lower rate of secular cooling of\r\nthe crust, volcanic action ought to become less powerful as the world\r\ngrows older.\r\n\r\n[1] Admirably illustrated in Prof. J. Milne's recently published work,\r\n_The Great Earthquake of Japan, 1891_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nA BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL VARIETIES OF VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text-books on this subject are so numerous and accessible, that a\r\nvery brief account of the volcanic rocks is all that need be given here\r\nfor the purposes of reference by readers not familiar with petrological\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nLet it be observed, in the first place, that there is no hard and fast\r\nline between the varieties of igneous and volcanic rocks. In this as in\r\nother parts of creation--_natura nil facit per saltum_; there are\r\ngradations from one variety to the other. At the same time a systematic\r\narrangement is not only desirable, but necessary; and the most important\r\nbasis of arrangement is that founded on the proportion of _silica_ (or\r\nquartz) in the various rocks, as first demonstrated by Durocher and\r\nBunsen, who showed that silica plays the same part in the inorganic\r\nkingdom that carbon does in the organic. Upon this hypothesis, which is\r\na very useful one to work with, these authors separated all igneous and\r\nvolcanic rocks into two classes, viz., the Basic and the Acid; the\r\nformer containing from 45-58 per cent., the latter 62-78 per cent. of\r\nthat mineral. But there are a few intermediate varieties which serve to\r\nbridge over the space between the Basic and Acid Groups. The following\r\nis a generalised arrangement of the most important rocks under the above\r\nheads:--\r\n\r\n_Tabular View of Chief Igneous and Volcanic Rocks._\r\n\r\nBASIC GROUP.\r\n\r\n1. Basalt and Dolerite.\r\n2. Gabbro.\r\n3. Diorite.\r\n4. Diabase and Melaphyre.\r\n5. Porphyrite.\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE GROUP.\r\n\r\n6. Syenite.\r\n7. Mica-trap, or Lampophyre.\r\n8. Andesite.\r\n\r\nACID GROUP.\r\n\r\n9. Trachyte, Domite, and Phonolite.\r\n10. Rhyolite and Obsidian.\r\n11. Granophyre.\r\n12. Granite.\r\n\r\nIn the above grouping, and in the following definitions, I have not been\r\nable to follow any special authority. But the most serviceable\r\ntext-books are those of Mr. Frank Rutley, _Study of Rocks_, and Dr.\r\nHatch, _Petrology_; also H. Rosenbusch, _Mikroskopische Physiographie\r\nder Mineralien_, and F. Zirkel's _Untersuchungen über mikroskopische\r\nStructur der Basaltgesteine_. We shall consider these in the order above\r\nindicated:--\r\n\r\n1. BASALT.--The most extensively distributed of all volcanic rocks. It\r\nis a dense, dark rock of high specific gravity (2.4-2.8), consisting of\r\nplagioclase felspar (Labradorite or anorthite), augite, and\r\ntitano-ferrite (titaniferous magnetite). Olivine is often present; and\r\nwhen abundant the rock is called \"olivine-basalt.\" In the older rocks,\r\nbasalt has often undergone decomposition into melaphyre; and amongst the\r\nmetamorphic rocks it has been changed into diorite or hornblende rock;\r\nthe augite having been converted into hornblende.\r\n\r\nWhen leucite or nepheline replaces plagioclase, the rock becomes a\r\nleucite-basalt,[1] or nepheline-basalt. Some basalts have a glass paste,\r\nor \"ground-mass,\" in which the minerals are enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe lava of Vesuvius may be regarded as a variety of basalt in which\r\nleucite replaces plagioclase, although this latter mineral is also\r\npresent. Zirkel calls it \"Sanidin-leucitgestein,\" as both the\r\nmacroscopic and microscopic structure reveal the presence of leucite,\r\nsanidine, plagioclase, nephiline, augite, mica, olivine, apatite, and\r\nmagnetite.[2]\r\n\r\n_Dolerite_ does not differ essentially from basalt in composition or\r\nstructure, but is a largely crystalline-granular variety, occurring more\r\nabundantly than basalt amongst the more ancient rocks, and the different\r\nminerals are distinctly visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nA remarkable variety of this rock occurs at Slieve Gullion in Ireland,\r\nin which mica is so abundant as to constitute the rock a \"micaceous\r\ndolerite.\"\r\n\r\n2. GABBRO.--A rather wide group of volcanic rocks with variable\r\ncomposition. Essentially it is a crystalline-granular compound of\r\nplagioclase, generally Labradorite and diallage. Sometimes the pyroxenic\r\nmineral becomes hypersthene, giving rise to _hypersthene-gabbro_; or\r\nwhen hornblende is present, to _hornblende-gabbro_; when olivine, to\r\n_olivine-gabbro_. Magnetite is always present.\r\n\r\nThese rocks occur in the Carlingford district in Ireland, in the Lizard\r\ndistrict of Cornwall, the Inner Hebrides (Mull, Skye, etc.) of Scotland,\r\nand in Saxony.\r\n\r\n3. DIORITE.--A crystalline-granular compound of plagioclase and\r\nhornblende with magnetite. When quartz is present it becomes (according\r\nto the usual British acceptation) a _syenite_; but this view is\r\ngradually giving place to the German definition of syenite, which is a\r\ncompound of orthoclase and hornblende; and it may be better to\r\ndenominate the variety as _quartz-diorite_. The diorites are abundant as\r\nsheets and dykes amongst the older palæozoic and metamorphic rocks, and\r\nare sometimes exceedingly rich in magnetite. Mica, epidote, and chlorite\r\nare also present as accessories.\r\n\r\nThe rock occurs in North Wales, Charnwood Forest, Wicklow, Galway, and\r\nDonegal, and the Highlands of Scotland. There can be little doubt that\r\namongst the metamorphic rocks of Galway, Mayo, and Donegal the great\r\nbeds of (often columnar) diorite were originally augitic lavas, which\r\nhave since undergone transformation.\r\n\r\n4. DIABASE.--It is very doubtful if \"Diabase\" ought to be regarded as a\r\ndistinct species of igneous rock, as it seems to be simply an altered\r\nvariety of basalt or dolerite, in which chlorite, a secondary\r\nalteration-product, has been developed by the decomposition of the\r\npyroxene or olivine of the original rock. It is a convenient name for\r\nuse in the field when doubt occurs as to the real nature of an igneous\r\nrock. Melaphyre is a name given to the very dark varieties of altered\r\naugitic lavas, rich in magnetite and chlorite.\r\n\r\n5. PORPHYRITE (or quartzless porphyry).--A basic variety of\r\nfelstone-porphyry, consisting of a felspathic base with distinct\r\ncrystals of felspar, with which there may be others of hornblende, mica,\r\nor augite. The colour is generally red or purple, and it weathers into\r\nred clay, in contrast to the highly acid or silicated felsites which\r\nweather into whitish sand.\r\n\r\n6. SYENITE.--As stated above, this name has been variously applied. Its\r\nderivation is from Syene (Assouan) in Egypt, and the granitic rocks of\r\nthat district were called \"syenites,\" under the supposition (now known\r\nto be erroneous) that they differ from ordinary granites in that they\r\nwere supposed to be composed of quartz, felspar, and hornblende, instead\r\nof quartz, felspar, and mica. From this it arose that syenite was\r\nregarded as a variety of granite in which the mica is replaced by\r\nhornblende, and this has generally been the British view of the\r\nquestion. But the German definition is applied to an entirely different\r\nrock, belonging to the felstone family; and according to this\r\nclassification syenite consists of a crystalline-granular compound of\r\northoclase and hornblende, in which quartz may or may not be present.\r\nFrom this it will be seen that, according to Zirkel, syenite is\r\nessentially distinct from diorite in the species of its felspar.[3] It\r\nseems desirable to adopt the German view; and as regards diorites\r\ncontaining quartz as an accessory, to apply to them the name of\r\n_quartz-diorite_, as stated above, the name syenite as used by British\r\ngeologists having arisen from a misconception.\r\n\r\n7. MICA-TRAP (LAMPOPHYRE).--A rock, allied to the felstone family, in\r\nwhich mica is an abundant and essential constituent, thus consisting of\r\nplagioclase and mica, with a little magnetite. Quartz may be an\r\naccessory. This rock occurs amongst the Lower Silurian strata of\r\nIreland, Cumberland, and the South of Scotland; it is not volcanic in\r\nthe ordinary acceptation of that term. The term _lampophyre_ was\r\nintroduced by Gümbel in describing the mica-traps of Fichtelgebirge.\r\n\r\n8. ANDESITE.--This is a dark-coloured, compact or vesicular,\r\nsemi-vitreous group of volcanic rocks, composed essentially of a glassy\r\nplagioclase felspar, and a ferro-magnesian constituent enclosed in a\r\nglassy base. According to the nature of the ferro-magnesian constituent,\r\nthe group may be divided into _hornblende-andesite_, _biotite-andesite_,\r\nand _augite-andesite_. Quartz is sometimes present, and when this\r\nmineral becomes an essential it gives rise to a variety called\r\n_quartz-andesite_ or _dacite_.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are the principal constituents of the lavas of the Andes,\r\nand the name was first applied to them by Leopold von Buch; but their\r\nrepresentatives also occur in the British Isles, Germany, and elsewhere.\r\nDacite is the lava of Krakatoa and some of the volcanoes of Japan.\r\n\r\n9, 10. TRACHYTE and DOMITE, etc.--These names include very numerous\r\nvarieties of highly silicated volcanic rock, and in their general form\r\nconsist of a white felsitic paste with distinct crystals of sanidine,\r\ntogether with plagioclase, augite, biotite, hornblende, and accessories.\r\nWhen crystalline grains or blebs of quartz occur, we have a\r\nquartz-trachyte; when tridymite is abundant, as in the trachyte of Co.\r\nAntrim, we have \"tridymite-trachyte.\"\r\n\r\nThe trachytes occupy a position between the pitchstone lavas on the one\r\nhand, and the andesites and granophyres on the other.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Domite_ is the name applied to the trachytic rocks of the\r\nAuvergne district and the Puy de Dôme particularly. They do not contain\r\nfree quartz, though they are highly acid rocks, containing sometimes as\r\nmuch as 68 per cent. of silica.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Phonolite (Clinkstone)_ is a trachytic rock, composed\r\nessentially of sanidine, nepheline, and augite or hornblende. It is\r\nusually of a greenish colour, hard and compact, so as to ring under the\r\nhammer; hence the name. The Wolf Rock is composed of phonolite, and it\r\noccurs largely in Auvergne.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Rhyolites_ are closely connected with the _quartz-trachytes_,\r\nbut present a marked fluidal, spherulitic, or perlitic structure. They\r\nconsist of a trachytic ground-mass in which grains or crystals of\r\nquartz and sanidine, with other accessory minerals, are imbedded. They\r\noccur amongst the volcanic rocks of the British Isles, Hungary, and the\r\nLipari Islands, from which the name _Liparite_ has been derived.\r\n\r\n(_e._) _Obsidian (Pitchstone)._--This is a vitreous, highly acid rock,\r\nwhich has become a volcanic glass in consequence of rapid cooling,\r\ndistinct minerals not having had time to form. It has a conchoidal\r\nfracture, various shades of colour from grey to black; and under the\r\nmicroscope is seen to contain crystallites or microliths, often\r\nbeautifully arranged in stellate or feathery groups. Spherulitic\r\nstructure is not infrequent; and occasionally a few crystals of\r\nsanidine, augite, or hornblende are to be seen imbedded in the glassy\r\nground-mass. The rock occurs in dykes and veins in the Western Isles of\r\nScotland, in Antrim, and on the borders of the Mourne Mountains, near\r\nNewry, in Ireland.\r\n\r\n11. GRANOPHYRE.--This term, according to Geikie, embraces the greater\r\nportion of the acid volcanic rocks of the Inner Hebrides. They are\r\nclosely allied to the quartz-porphyries, and vary in texture from a fine\r\nfelsitic or crystalline-granular quartz-porphyry, in the ground-mass of\r\nwhich porphyritic turbid felspar and quartz may generally be detected,\r\nto a granitoid rock of medium grain, in which the component dull felspar\r\nand clear quartz can be readily distinguished by the naked eye.\r\nThroughout all the varieties of texture there is a strong tendency to\r\nthe development of minute irregularly-shaped cavities, inside of which\r\nquartz or felspar has crystallised out--a feature characteristic of the\r\ngranites of Arran and of the Mourne Mountains.\r\n\r\n12. GRANITE.--A true granite consists of a crystalline-granular rock\r\nconsisting of quartz, felspar (orthoclase), and mica; the quartz is the\r\npaste or ground-mass in which the felspar and mica crystals are\r\nenclosed. This is the essential distinction between a granite and a\r\nquartz-porphyry or a granophyre. Owing to the presence of highly-heated\r\nsteam under pressure in the body of the mass when in a molten condition,\r\nthe quartz has been the last of the minerals to crystallise out, and\r\nhence does not itself occur with the crystalline form.\r\n\r\nTrue granite is not a volcanic rock, and its representatives amongst\r\nvolcanic ejecta are to be found in the granophyres, quartz-porphyries,\r\nfelsites, trachytes, and rhyolites so abundant in most volcanic\r\ncountries, and to one or other of these the so-called granites of the\r\nMourne Mountains, of Arran Island, and of Skye are to be referred.\r\nGranite is a rock which has been intruded in a molten condition\r\namongst the deep-seated parts of the crust, and has consolidated\r\nunder great pressure in presence of aqueous vapour and with extreme\r\nslowness, resulting in the formation of a rock which is largely\r\ncrystalline-granular. Its presence at the surface is due to denudation\r\nof the masses by which it was originally overspread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.]\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE I.\r\n\r\nMAGNIFIED SECTIONS OF VESUVIAN MINERALS.\r\n\r\n     Fig. 1.
