[PRICE 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELVOIR CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nBelvoir Castle, (or Bever, as it was formerly and is now sometimes\r\ncalled,) in situation and aspect partly resembles \"majestic Windsor.\"\r\nIt has a similar \"princely brow,\" being placed upon an abrupt\r\nelevation of a kind of natural cliff, forming the termination of a\r\npeninsular hill, the basis of which is red grit stone, but now covered\r\nwith vegetable mould, well turfed by nature and art, and varied into\r\nterraces of different elevation. It has been the seat of the noble\r\nfamily of Manners for several generations; it claims the priority of\r\nevery other seat in the county wherein it is situate; and is one of\r\nthe most magnificent castellated structures in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis castle, in some topographical works, is described as being in\r\nLincolnshire. Camden says, \"In the west part of Kesteven, on the edge\r\nof Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, there stands Belvoir Castle, so\r\ncalled (whatever was its ancient name) from the fine prospect on a\r\nsteep hill, which seems the work of art.\" Burton expressly says\r\nthat it \"is certainly in Lincolnshire,\" and the authors of _Magna\r\nBritannia_ are of the same opinion; but Mr. Nichols, whose authority\r\non subjects of local history, respecting Leicestershire, is generally\r\ndecisive and satisfactory, states that \"the castle is at present in\r\nevery respect considered as being within this county with all the\r\nlands of the extra-parochial part of Belvoir thereto belonging,\r\n(including the site of the Priory,[1]) consisting in the whole of\r\nabout 600 acres of wood, meadow, and pasture land; upon which are now\r\nno buildings but the castle, with its offices and the inn. It would be\r\na difficult matter, notwithstanding, to trace out with accuracy, the\r\nprecise boundary of the two counties in this neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] At Belvoir was formerly a priory of four black monks,\r\n    subordinate to the Abbey of St. Alban, in Hertfordshire, to which\r\n    it was annexed by its founder, Robert de Belvideir, or De Todenci,\r\n    in the time of William the Conqueror. It was dedicated to St.\r\n    Mary; and was valued, at the Dissolution, at £104 19s. 10d. per\r\n    annum. Dr. Stukely, in the year 1726, saw the coffin and bones of\r\n    the founder, who died in 1088, dug up in the Priory chapel, then\r\n    a stable and on a stone was inscribed in large letters, with lead\r\n    cast in them, ROBERT DE TODENE LE FVDEVR. Another coffin and\r\n    cover near it was likewise discovered with the following\r\n    inscription:--\"The Vale of Bever, barren of wood, is large and\r\n    very plentiful of good corn and grass, and lieth in three shires,\r\n    Leicester, Lincoln, and much in Nottinghamshire.\"\r\n\r\nThat Belvoir has been the site of a castle since the Norman Conquest\r\nappears well established. Leland says, \"The Castle of Belvoir standeth\r\nin the utter part of that way of Leicestershire, on the nape of an\r\nhigh hill, steep up each way, partly by nature, partly by working of\r\nmen's hands, as it may evidently be perceived. Whether there were any\r\ncastle there before the Conquest or no I am not sure, but surely I\r\nthink no rather than ye. Toteneius was the first inhabiter after the\r\nConquest. Then it came to Albeneius, and from Albeney to Ros.\"\r\n\r\nThe Belvoir estate came into the Manners family, by the marriage of\r\nEleanor with Robert de Manners of Ethale, Northumberland. Eleanor was\r\nthe eldest sister of Edmund, Lord Ros, who resided at the manor-house\r\nof Elsinges, in Enfield, Middlesex, where he died without issue in the\r\nyear 1508. His sisters became heiresses to the estates, and Belvoir\r\nbeing part of the moiety of Eleanor, became the property of the\r\nManners family, who have continued to possess it to the present time.\r\n\r\nAs the possessors of this castle and lordship have been chiefly\r\npersons of considerable eminence, and many of them numbered among the\r\ngreat men of history, it may be as well to interweave a few notices\r\nof them with a brief chronological account of the noble structure.\r\nRobert, the first Norman lord, died in 1088, and was buried in the\r\nchapter-house of the Priory, where Dr. Stukely discovered the stone\r\nalready named, to his memory. \"By a general survey taken at the\r\ndeath of Robert, it appears that he was in possession of fourscore\r\nlordships: many of which, by uninterrupted succession, continue still\r\nto be the property of the Duke of Rutland. In Lincolnshire his domains\r\nwere still more numerous. In Northamptonshire he had nine lordships;\r\none of which, Stoke, acquired the additional name of Albini, when it\r\ncame into the possession of his son.\" William de Albini, son of the\r\nabove, succeeded to these lordships; and, like his father, was a\r\ncelebrated warrior: according to Matthew Paris, he valourously\r\ndistinguished himself at the battle of Tinchebrai, in Normandy,\r\nSeptember 27, 1106; where Henry I. encountered Robert Curthose, his\r\nbrother. This lord obtained from Henry the grant of an annual fair at\r\nBelvoir, to be continued for eight days. During the changeful reigns\r\nof Stephen and Henry II., the castle fell into the hands of the\r\ncrown, and was granted to Ranulph de Gernons, Earl of Chester; but\r\nrepossession was obtained by de Albini, who died here about the year\r\n1155. William de Albini, (alias Meschines and Britto,) the next\r\npossessor of Belvoir, endowed the Priory hero with certain lands, and,\r\nin 1165, certified to Henry II. that he then held of him thirty-two\r\nknights' fees under the old feoffments, whereby he was enfeoffed\r\nin the time of Henry I. William de Albini, the third of that name,\r\naccompanied Richard I. during his crusading reign, into Normandy: he\r\nwas also one of the sureties for King John, in his treaty of peace\r\nwith Philip of France. He was too, engaged in the barons' wars in the\r\nlatter reign, and was taken prisoner by the king's party at Rochester\r\nCastle; his own castle at Belvoir also falling into the royal hands.\r\nHe was likewise one of the twenty-five barons, whose signatures were\r\nattached to Magna Charta and the charter of Forests at Runnemede. This\r\nlord richly endowed the priory of Belvoir, and founded and endowed a\r\nhospital at Wassebridge, between Stamford and Uffingham, where he was\r\nburied in 1236. Isabel, of the house of Albini, now married to Robert\r\nde Ros, or Roos, baron of Hamlake, and thus carried the estates into a\r\nnew family. The bounds of the lordship of Belvoir, at this time, are\r\ndescribed by a document printed in Nichols's History. This new lord\r\nobtained a license from Henry III. to hold a weekly market and annual\r\nfair at Belvoir. He died in 1285, and his body was buried at Kirkham,\r\nhis bowels before the high altar at Belvoir, and his heart at Croxton\r\nAbbey; it being a practice of that age for the corporeal remains of\r\neminent persons to be thus distributed after death. The next owner,\r\nWilliam de Ros was, in 1304, allowed to impark 100 acres under\r\nthe name of _Bever_ Park, which was appropriated solely to the\r\npreservation of game. He died in 1317: his eldest son, William de Ros,\r\ntook the title of Baron Ros, of Hamlake, Werke, Belvoir, and Trusbut;\r\nwas Lord High Admiral of England, and sat in parliament from 11 Edw.\r\nII. to 16 Edw. III; he died in 1342. Sir William de Ros, knight, was\r\nLord High Treasurer to Henry IV.; he died at the Castle in 1414, and\r\nbequeathed 400_l._ \"for finding ten honest chaplains to pray for his\r\nsoul, and the souls of his father, mother, brethren, sisters, &c.\" for\r\neight years within his chapel at Belvoir castle. John and William Ros,\r\nthe next owners, were distinguished in the wars of France; the former\r\nwas slain at Anjou; the latter died in 1431, and was succeeded by his\r\nson, Edmund, an infant, who, on coming of age, engaged in the civil\r\nwars of York and Lancaster: he was attainted in 1641, and his noble\r\npossessions parcelled out by Edward IV; the honour, castle, and\r\nlordship of Belvoir, with the park and all its members, and the rent\r\ncalled castle-guard, (then an appurtenance to Belvoir,) being granted\r\nin 1647, to Hastings the court corruptionist.[2] The attainder was,\r\nhowever, repealed, and Edmund, Lord Ros re-obtained possession of all\r\nhis estates in 1483: he died at Enfield, and the estates then passed\r\ninto the Manners family, as we have stated.\r\n\r\n    [2] \"The Lord Ros took Henry the VIth's part against King Edward,\r\n    whereupon his lands were confiscated, and Belever Castle given in\r\n    keeping to Lord Hastings, who coming thither on a time to peruse\r\n    the ground, and to lie in the castle, was suddenly repelled by Mr.\r\n    Harrington, a man of power thereabouts, and friend to the Lord\r\n    Ros. Whereupon the Lord Hastings came thither another time with a\r\n    strong power, and upon a raging will spoiled the castle, defacing\r\n    the roofs, and taking the leads off them.--Then fell all the\r\n    castle to ruins, and the timber of the roofs uncovered, rotted\r\n    away, and the soil between the walls at the last grew full of\r\n    elders, and no habitation was there till that, of late days, the\r\n    Earl of Rutland hath made it fairer than ever it was.\"--_Leland_.\r\n\r\nGeorge, eldest son of the above-named Robert Manners, succeeded to his\r\nfather's estates, including Belvoir: in his will, a copy of which is\r\ngiven by Mr. Nichols, dated Oct. 6, 1513, he is styled \"Sir George\r\nManners, knight, Lord Ros.\" He was interred, with his lady, in a\r\nchantry chapel, founded by his father-in-law, Sir Thomas Ledger, in\r\nthe chapel of St. George, at Windsor. His son, Thomas, Lord Ros,\r\nsucceeded him, and was created by Henry VIII. a knight, and afterwards\r\nEarl of Rutland, a title which had never before been conferred on\r\nany person but of the blood royal. This nobleman aided Henry in the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries, and for his zeal received from the\r\nmonarch several manors and estates. He caused many of the ancient\r\nmonuments of the Albinis and the Rosses to be removed from the priory\r\nchurches of Belvoir and Croxton to that of Bottesford. He also\r\nrestored and in part rebuilt the castle, which had been in ruins since\r\nHastings's attack. The state of the castle at this period is thus\r\ndescribed by Leland:--\"It is a straunge sighte to se be how many\r\nsteppes of stone the way goith up from the village to the castel.\r\nIn the castel be two faire gates; and the dungeon is a faire rounde\r\ntowere now turned to pleasure, as a place to walk yn, and to se al\r\nthe counterye aboute, and raylid about the round (wall,) and a garden\r\n(plotte) in the midle. There is also a welle of grete depth in the\r\ncastelle, and the spring thereof is very good.\" Henry, the second Bard\r\nof Rutland, succeeded his father in 1543; and in 1556 was appointed\r\ncaptain-general of all the forces then going to France, and commander\r\nof the fleet, by Philip and Mary. Edward, the third earl, eldest son\r\nof the former, succeeded in 1563: Camden calls him \"a profound lawyer,\r\nand a man accomplished with all polite learning.\" John, a colonel of\r\nfoot in the Irish wars, became fourth earl in 1587, and was followed\r\nby his son Roger, the fifth earl, who dying without issue, his brother\r\nFrancis was nominated his heir, and made the sixth earl. He married\r\ntwo wives, by the first of whom he had only one child, named\r\nCatherine, who married George Villiers, the first Duke of Buckingham.\r\nHer issue, George, the second Duke of Buckingham, dying without an\r\nheir, the title of Lord Ros of Hamlake again reverted to the Rutland\r\nfamily. By a second marriage he had two sons, who, according to the\r\nmonument, were murdered by wicked practice and sorcery.[3] George\r\nwas created seventh earl in 1632; and was honoured with a visit from\r\nCharles I. at Belvoir castle, in 1634. The eighth earl was John\r\nManners, who attaching himself to the Parliamentarians, the castle was\r\nattacked by the royal army, and lost and won again and again by each\r\nparty, till the earl being \"put to great streights for the maintenance\r\nof his family,\" petitioned the house of peers for relief, and Lord\r\nViscount Campden having been the principal instrument in the ruin of\r\nthe \"castle, lands, and woods about Belvoyre,\" parliament agreed that\r\n1,500l a year be paid out of Lord Campden's estate, until 5,000l\r\nbe levied, to the earl of Rutland. In the civil wars the castle was\r\ndefended for the king by the rector of Ashwell, co. Rutland. In 1649,\r\nthe parliament ordered it to be demolished; satisfaction was, however,\r\nmade to the earl, whose son rebuilt the castle after the Restoration.\r\nJohn, the ninth earl, succeeded his father in 1679. He preferred the\r\nbaronial retirement and rural quiet of Belvoir, to the busy court;\r\nthough he was created Marquess of Granby, in the county of Nottingham,\r\nand Duke of Rutland. He died in 1710-11, and was succeeded by his son\r\nJohn;[4] whose eldest son became the third Duke of Rutland, and was\r\nthe last of the family who resided at Haddon, Derbyshire. He died in\r\n1779, and was succeeded by his grandson, Charles, Lord Ros, fourth\r\nduke, who died lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1787, when his son John\r\nHenry, the present and fifth duke succeeded to the titles and estates.\r\n\r\n    [3] As illustrative of the folly and superstition of the times,\r\n    it may be interesting to explain this. Joan Flower, and her two\r\n    daughters, who were servants at Belvoir Castle, having\r\n    been dismissed the family, in revenge, made use of all the\r\n    enchantments, spells, and charms, that were at that time supposed\r\n    to answer their malicious purposes. Henry, the eldest son, died\r\n    soon after their dismissal; but no suspicion of witchcraft arose\r\n    till five years after, when the three women, who are said to have\r\n    entered into a formal contract with the devil, were accused of\r\n    \"murdering Henry Lord Ros by witchcraft, and torturing the Lord\r\n    Francis, his brother, and Lady Catharine, his sister.\" After\r\n    various examinations, before Francis Lord Willoughby, of Eresby,\r\n    and other magistrates, they were committed to Lincoln gaol. Joan\r\n    died at Ancaster, on her way thither, by wishing the bread and\r\n    butter she ate might choak her if guilty. The two daughters were\r\n    tried before Sir Henry Hobbert, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,\r\n    and Sir Edward Bromley, one of the Barons of Exchequer, confessed\r\n    their guilt, and were executed at Lincoln, March 11, 1618-19.\r\n\r\n    [4] \"The _great Marquess of Granby_\" born in 1721, was the son of\r\n    this duke. During the rebellion he raised a regiment of foot. In\r\n    1758, being lieutenant-general, he was sent into Germany, and\r\n    eminently distinguished himself under Prince Ferdinand of\r\n    Brunswick. He died in 1770, and was buried with his ancestors at\r\n    Bottesford, where, a few years since, there was no monumental\r\n    record of his name!\r\n\r\nIt is now time to speak of the present magnificence of Belvoir. The\r\ncastle which surrounds a quadrangular court, occupies nearly the\r\nsummit of the hill, which is ascended by superb stone steps. On the\r\ncastle are mounted seven small pieces of cannon, which were presented\r\nto the Duke of Rutland by George the Third; from these pieces 21\r\nrounds were fired Nov. 5, 1808, in commemoration of the Gunpowder\r\nPlot. The view from the terraces and towers comprehends the whole vale\r\nof Belvoir, and the adjoining country as far as Lincoln, including\r\ntwenty-two of the Duke of Rutland's manors. On the southern slope\r\nof the hill are enclosed terraces, on which there are several\r\nflower-gardens, surrounded by extensive shrubberies. The\r\nkitchen-gardens extend to eight acres. The park is of great extent,\r\nand contains fine forest trees which form a woodland beneath the hill,\r\nso extensive as to afford shelter for innumerable rooks. There are\r\nlikewise thriving plantations, containing some remarkably fine young\r\noaks.\r\n\r\nBelvoir Castle has one of the most superb _interiors_ in the kingdom:\r\nits furniture and decorations are of the most costly description.\r\nIt also contains one of the most valuable collections of paintings,\r\nwhether considered for the variety of schools, or the judicious choice\r\nof the works of each master. Among those who have contributed to\r\nthis invaluable assemblage, are Poussin, Carlo Dolci, Guido, Claude\r\nLorraine, Salvator Rosa, Murillo, Reubens, Teniers, and Reynolds.\r\nThe collection was principally formed by John, the third duke, and\r\nCharles, his successor, who were munificent patrons of the arts. All\r\nthe modern pictures, of which there are a considerable number, were\r\ncollected by the former duke.\r\n\r\nThe last general repairs of Belvoir Castle are stated to have cost the\r\nnoble owner upwards of 60,000£. The structure has been more than once\r\nextensively injured by fire. A conflagration there in October, 1816,\r\nconsumed a large portion of the ancient part of the castle, and\r\nseveral of the pictures. Among them was Sir Joshua Reynolds's\r\n_Nativity_, a composition of thirteen figures, and in dimensions 12\r\nfeet by 18. This noble picture was purchased by the late Duke of\r\nRutland for 1,200 guineas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAINTER'S LAST PASSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A hectic hue is on my feverish cheek,\r\n  And slowly throbs my pulse--but it will cease;\r\n  And cease, too, will the visions instinct,\r\n  Impalpable, and deep, that haunt my soul!\r\n  Death, who can dash the chalice from the lips\r\n  Of Pleasure's votary, and hush the lyre\r\n  While poetry is breathing on its strings;\r\n  Death, who can quench the spirit which portrays\r\n  Beauty's resemblance on the marble urn,\r\n  Will steep my feelings in oblivion's gloom,\r\n  Ere wintry winds disperse the sunny leaves\r\n  That cluster round the bosom of the rose.\r\n  But I have communed with enchanting shapes,\r\n  And felt the silver gush of many a song\r\n  Amid the air, until my spirit seem'd\r\n  Instinct with glorious draughts of paradise!\r\n  Mine eyes have scarcely closed their burning lids\r\n  For many a night; and I have watch'd the stars\r\n  That smiled upon me from the brow of heaven,\r\n  Like deep blue orbs familiar to my youth;\r\n  But now abstraction clouds me, and the fire--\r\n  Ambition's fire--it can be nothing less--\r\n  Deserts its lonely shrine; but I must give\r\n  The last bright touch to this bewitching form,\r\n  This pictured rainbow of my solitude!\r\n  I have invested her with loveliness\r\n  More pure than beings of the earth assume,\r\n  And Memory calls her beauteous image back\r\n  From the forgotten things of distant years,\r\n  Warm, eloquent, and holy, as the balm\r\n  Of flow'rs impearl'd with dew, which summer skies\r\n  Diffuse around--I mark the marble brow\r\n  Of polish'd symmetry, the eyes more blue\r\n  Than violets in their vernal bloom, the neck\r\n  Swanlike, and moulded with ethereal grace;\r\n  And feel their magic influence on my mind.\r\n  I will embody them, and give the stamp\r\n  Of fervid genius to their various charms,\r\n  Ere this last aspiration is extinct\r\n  In the unbroken slumbers of the tomb!\r\n  For I have had prophetic monitors\r\n  To warn me of my fate, and I must leave\r\n  All that is lovely in this lovely world.\r\n\r\n  It is a summer eve--the sunbeams tinge\r\n  The glassy bosom of the quiet lake;\r\n  The music of the birds enchants the air,\r\n  And Nature's verdant robe is gemm'd with flow'rs.\r\n  From which the breeze derives its liquid balm.\r\n  Oh! in my youth, this hour has been to me\r\n  Bright as the fairy arch upon the clouds\r\n  Of earthly grief and gloom, and even now\r\n  It gives the silent fountain of my heart\r\n  A renovated action, and recalls\r\n  The energies that long ago were mine.\r\n  My fancy wanders as I thus portray\r\n  The lineaments on which 'tis bliss to gaze:\r\n  How beautiful their prototype! to whom\r\n  I breath'd in youth the most impassion'd words,\r\n  And felt as if Elysium had disclosed\r\n  Its glory to my eye--around this brow,\r\n  Stainless as marble, cluster golden curls\r\n  Like sunbeams on the bosom of the cloud,\r\n  And o'er the radiant azure orbs beneath,\r\n  The snowy lids suspend their glossy fringe.\r\n  Upon such beauty shall my pencil stamp\r\n  Its immortality, and make it seem\r\n  More beautiful in Fancy's softest glow;\r\n  And, my beloved!

that symbol of purest faith\r\n  Had cheer'd the heart in the hour of death,\r\n  And shone triumphant o'er the brave\r\n  As they crush'd the power of the sceptred slave.\r\n\r\n  It seem'd like a spell on the lips of all\r\n  Whom the trumpet call'd from their festive hall,\r\n  And the soldier to it upturn'd his eye\r\n  As he lay on the grassy turf to die.\r\n\r\n  But it gleams no more on land or sea,\r\n  A star to the feudal chivalry!\r\n  On the silent hearth, and the ivied tower,\r\n  Hath it found a last forsaken bower.

Very likely he may\r\nfind pity for me, and bring to me the fruit of the tree of life.\"\r\nImmediately, all his sons offered themselves; and Seth, the most\r\npious, was chosen by his father for the message. He besprinkled his\r\nhead with ashes, hastened, and delayed not, until he stood before\r\nthe gate of Paradise. Then prayed he, \"Let my father find pity,\r\nkind-hearted one, and send to him fruit from the tree of life.\"\r\nQuickly there stood the glittering cherub, and instead of the tree of\r\nlife, he held a twig of three leaves in his hand. \"Carry this to thy\r\nfather,\" said he, friendly, \"his last consolation is here; for eternal\r\nlife dwells not on the earth.\" Swiftly hastened Seth, threw himself\r\ndown, and said, \"No fruit of the tree of life bring I to thee,\r\nmy father, only this twig has the angel given me, to be thy last\r\nconsolation here.\" The dying man took the twig, and was glad. He\r\nsmelled on it the fragrance of Paradise, and then was his soul\r\nelevated: \"Children,\" said he, \"eternal life dwells not for us on the\r\nearth; you must follow after me; but on these leaves I breathe the\r\nrefreshing air of another world.\" Then his eyes failed; his spirit\r\nfled hence.\r\n\r\nAdam's children buried their father, and wept for him thirty days; but\r\nSeth wept not. He planted the twig upon his father's grave, at the\r\nhead of the dead man, and named it the twig of the new life, of the\r\nawakening up out of the sleep of death. The little twig grew up into a\r\nhigh tree, and by it many of Adam's children strengthened themselves\r\nwith comfort of the other life. So it came to the following\r\ngeneration. In the garden of David it blossomed fair, until his\r\ninfatuated son began to doubt on immortality; then withered the twig,\r\nthough its blossoms came among other nations. And as on a stem from\r\nthis tree, the restorer of immortality gave up his holy life; from it\r\nthe fragrance of the new life scattered itself around far among all\r\nnations.

OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE PEOPLE; OR, THE PLAIN WHY AND\r\nBECAUSE.)_\r\n\r\n_Why may the atmosphere be termed a fourth kingdom of Nature?_\r\n\r\nBecause it extends its influence in an equal degree over the three\r\nkingdoms, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral, operates upon\r\neach after a distinct manner, and appears rather to be independent,\r\nand allied to all of them, than to be rightly included within any one.\r\n\r\n_Why is a knowledge of the atmosphere important to the naturalist?_\r\n\r\nBecause it serves to throw much light on the history and functions\r\nboth of the animal and vegetable creation; for it is through this\r\ngreat medium that heat, light, electricity, oxygen, and the great\r\nsprings of vital phenomena, are conveyed to all classes of organized\r\nmatter. It is by means of this wonderful agent, that we gain the\r\ntheory of respiration in all classes of creatures possessing animal\r\nlife; and that we become acquainted with the migrations of animals,\r\nas well as many of their peculiar instincts and habits. It is the\r\natmosphere that enables us to account for the periodical changes in\r\nthe plumage of birds and the furs of animals, and the variety of\r\ncolours to be found amongst them. By means also of the elasticity of\r\nthe atmosphere, sounds and odours are transmitted to sensitive beings.\r\nAtmospherical phenomena, it may be safely inferred, attracted the\r\nobservation of mankind in the earliest ages: we know that the\r\nEgyptians and the Greeks wrote upon the subject; the Jews too, a\r\npastoral people, \"could discern the face of the sky;\" and even in our\r\nday, shepherds may be ranked among the weather-wise. \"This is a fine\r\nmorning, a soft day, or a cold evening,\" are modes of salutation with\r\nus, as commonly as is the \"Salem Alikem\" (Peace be with you!) amongst\r\nthe inhabitants of the more serene countries of the East. Shenstone\r\nsays, though with nearly equal spleen and truth: \"there is nothing\r\nmore universally commended than a fine day: the reason is, that people\r\ncan commend it without envy.\"\r\n\r\n_Why do we call the atmosphere a fluid?_\r\n\r\nBecause it has a tendency to move in all directions, and consequently\r\nrushes in and fills every space not previously occupied by a more\r\nsolid substance. Hence we find, that every cave, crevice, place, and\r\nvessel, having communication with the atmosphere, if it be not filled\r\nwith something else, is filled with air; against which it is no\r\nargument that we do not see it, as it is perfectly transparent, and\r\nconsequently invisible.\r\n\r\n_Why do birds fly?_\r\n\r\nBecause of the inertia of the atmosphere, which gives effect to their\r\nwings. Were it possible for a bird to live without respiration, and in\r\na space void of air, it would no longer have the power of flight. The\r\nplumage of the wings being spread, and acting with a broad surface\r\non the atmosphere beneath them, is resisted by the inertia of the\r\natmosphere, so that the air forms a falcrum, as it were, on which the\r\nbird rises, by the leverage of its wings.\r\n\r\n_Why is air generally considered to be invisible?_\r\n\r\nBecause, though a coloured fluid, and naturally blue, its colour\r\nacquires intensity only, or, in other words, becomes visible only,\r\nfrom the depth of the transparent mass. According to rigid Newtonians,\r\nair is transparent, or, rather, invisible; and the azure colour of the\r\natmosphere arises from the greater refrangibility of the blue rays of\r\nlight. Other philosophers imagine that the blue tint is inherent in\r\nair; that is, that the particles of air have the property of producing\r\na blue colour, in their combination with light.\r\n\r\n_Why are the most distant objects in a prospect of a blue tinge?_\r\n\r\nBecause their colours are always tinted by the deepening hues of the\r\ninterjacent atmosphere. Again, the blending of the atmospheric azure\r\nwith the colours of the solar rays, produces those compound and\r\nsometimes remarkable tints, with which the sky and clouds are\r\nemblazoned. Hence, the mountains appear blue, not because that is\r\ntheir colour, but because it is the colour of the medium through which\r\nthey are seen.\r\n\r\n_Why do the Heavens appear blue?_\r\n\r\nBecause of our looking at the dark vacuity beyond our atmosphere\r\nthrough an illuminated medium. Were there no atmosphere, it is\r\nuniversally admitted the appearance would be perfectly black, except\r\nin the particular direction of the sun, or some other of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and since the atmosphere is transparent, this blackness (if\r\nsuch an expression may be used) must be seen through it, only somewhat\r\nmodified by the rays of light reflected by the atmosphere to the eye,\r\nfrom the direction in which we look. For this reason, the clearer or\r\nmore transparent the atmosphere is, the darker is the appearance of\r\nthe heavens, there being then less light reflected by the atmosphere\r\nto the eye. In the zenith, the appearance is always darker than nearer\r\nthe horizon; and from the tops of high mountains, the heavens in\r\nthe zenith appear nearly black.--_Mr. B. Hallowell, in the American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts._\r\n\r\n_Why does the heat of temperature of different parts of the earth\r\nvary?_\r\n\r\nBecause of the position of the place with respect to the equator, or\r\nrather to the ecliptic, or, more strictly still, with respect to the\r\nplane in which the earth revolves around the sun; for on this relation\r\ndepends the temperature of the place, so far as it is produced,\r\ndirectly, by the influence of the sun. Maltebrun ascribes to it the\r\nfollowing influences: 1, the action of the sun upon the atmosphere: 2,\r\nthe interior temperature of the globe: 3, the elevation of the earth\r\nabove the level of the ocean: 4, the general inclination of the\r\nsurface, and its local exposure: 5, the position of its mountains\r\nrelatively to the cardinal points: 6, the neighbourhood of great seas,\r\nand their relative situation: 7, the geological nature of the soil: 8,\r\nthe degree of cultivation, and of population, at which a country has\r\narrived: 9, the prevalent winds.\r\n\r\n_Why are the strata of air upon all mountains of successive coldness?_\r\n\r\nBecause the air does not acquire immediately, by the passage of the\r\nsolar rays, a considerable degree of heat. Thus, with the elevation of\r\nland, cold may be said to increase in very rapid progression. Winter\r\ncontinues to reign on the Alps and the Pyrenees, while the flowers of\r\nspring are covering the plains of northern France. This beneficent\r\nappointment of Nature considerably increases the number of habitable\r\ncountries in the torrid zone. It is probable, that at the back of the\r\nflat burning coasts of Guinea, there exist in the centre of Africa,\r\ncountries which enjoy a delightful temperature; as we see the vernal\r\nvalley of Quito, situate under the same latitude with the destructive\r\ncoasts of French Guyana, where the humid heat constantly cherishes the\r\nseeds of disease. On the other hand, it is the continued elevation\r\nof the ground, which, in the central parts of Asia, extends the cold\r\nregion to the 35th parallel of latitude, so that in ascending from\r\nBengal to Thibet, we imagine ourselves in a few days transported from\r\nthe equator to the pole.--_Maltebrun._\r\n\r\n_Why does the destruction of forests sometimes prove beneficial to a\r\ncountry?_\r\n\r\nBecause a freer circulation of air is thus procured--but carried too\r\nfar, it becomes a scourge which may desolate whole regions. We have\r\na sad example of this in the Cape de Verde islands, not to mention\r\nothers. It is the destruction of forests, and not a supposed cooling\r\nof the globe, which has rendered the southern part of Iceland more\r\naccessible to the dreadful cold which is too often produced by those\r\nmasses of floating ice which are intercepted and detained by its\r\nnorthern coasts.--Ibid.\r\n\r\n_Why do mountains influence climates?_\r\n\r\nBecause, although they cannot prevent the general motions of the\r\natmosphere from taking place, they may, by stopping them in part,\r\nrender particular winds more or less frequent throughout a certain\r\nextent of country. Maltebrun observes, there cannot be a doubt that\r\nthe Alps contribute in securing to Italy its delightful and happy\r\nclimate, its perpetual spring, and its double harvests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURALIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOAD FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [We quote these interesting details from a paper on the Sargasso\r\n    Weed, or gulf weed, with which a certain part of the Atlantic\r\n    Ocean is generally covered, and amongst which Toad Fish are\r\n    found. The reason of the weed accumulating has given rise to much\r\n    difference of opinion, which is the main subject of the above\r\n    communication, by Mr. Benet, of Bulstrode-street, to the _Naval\r\n    Magazine_[5]]\r\n\r\n    [5] We are happy to perceive that the above journal rises\r\n    in interest and value as it proceeds; and merits all the\r\n    encouragement our notice of its first appearance may have induced\r\n    our readers to confer upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toad Fish]\r\n\r\nThe figure represents one of those fishes to which, on account of\r\ntheir uncouth appearance, the name of Toad Fish has been popularly\r\ngiven. Under this denomination there have been included many very\r\ndissimilar kinds, extreme ugliness being held as alone sufficient for\r\nthe establishment of an undeniable claim to the title. The present\r\nfish, and those nearly related to it, advance, however, peculiar\r\nclaims to the appellation. Their belly and side fins are borne upon\r\nsupports which project from the body in the semblance of limbs, their\r\nsimilarity to which is increased by the jointed form they acquire at\r\nthe point of union of the fin with its support, and still farther\r\nby the finger-like appearance of the rays of these fins, which are\r\nunconnected by membrane at their tips. This curious structure imparts\r\nto these fishes not only somewhat of the outward form of a quadruped,\r\nbut also a portion of its habits, and they are, accordingly, capable\r\nof crawling like toads among the sea-weeds and rocks which they\r\nusually inhabit; the side fins, which are placed farther back than\r\nthose of the belly, performing on each occasion the functions of\r\nhinder feet. Nor is this mode of locomotion confined to the water\r\nalone; it may, also, be exercised by them on land, for their\r\ngill-openings are so small, that evaporation takes place but slowly\r\nfrom within them, and thus the gills are kept moistened, and the\r\ncirculation of the blood is preserved, even out of the water, for two\r\nor three days. So remarkable a deviation from the usual appearance and\r\nhabits of the class to which they belong, has naturally caused them to\r\nbe regarded as objects of curiosity; and it is recorded, that living\r\nspecimens have been successfully transported from the East to Holland,\r\nwhere they have been sold at considerable prices.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of this genus, to which Commerson gave the name of\r\nAntennarius, (on account of the filament which they possess on the\r\nforehead,) are met with in the sea of warm climates, in the east as\r\nwell as in the west. They subsist chiefly on small crabs, to surprise\r\nwhich they hide themselves among the sea-weed, or behind stones. Their\r\nflesh is said not to be edible; it may, perhaps, have been rejected,\r\non account of their disgusting appearance, and is certainly too small\r\nin quantity to allow of its being important as an article of food.\r\nIn swimming, they usually gulp down air, and, thus distending their\r\ncapacious stomachs, enlarge themselves into a rounded half-floating\r\nmass, much in the same manner as the globe of balloon fishes. Their\r\nnearest affinity is to the fishes known as anglers, with which\r\nthey agree in the form of their gill-openings and fins, and in\r\nthe possession of filaments on the head; but the monstrously\r\ndisproportioned head of the anglers, which is depressed from\r\nabove downwards, and the enormous opening of their mouth, readily\r\ndistinguish them from the Toad Fishes, whose head is of moderate size,\r\nand, like their bodies, compressed laterally. They are either smooth\r\nor variously hairy or bristly, and are always destitute of the regular\r\nscales with which fishes are generally invested. They are furnished,\r\nespecially on the lips and the under parts, with numerous short, loose\r\nprocesses of skin, which add considerably to their sense of touch.\r\nThere is great variety in the different kinds in the length of the\r\nfilament on the head, and its termination is still more varied; in\r\nsome it is almost simple, as though formed of a single undilated hair;\r\nin others, it is surmounted by a small, dense, globular mass of short\r\nfilaments; and in others again, it has two, or even three large fleshy\r\nprocesses at its end, not unlike the baits which terminate the fishing\r\nfilaments of the anglers.\r\n\r\nIn the species figured, the Antennarius Iaevigatus, the skin is\r\nsmooth, and furnished with short loose processes; the filament on the\r\nhead is short, and terminated by a small knob of clustered minute\r\nfilaments; this is succeeded by two other processes, each resembling\r\na fin supported by a single ray, and fringed, especially towards its\r\nupper part, by loose portions of skin; to these succeed the back fin,\r\nsupported, as usual, by many rays. The colour is pale, irregularly\r\nblotched, spotted, and streaked with brown, the markings varying\r\nconsiderably in different individuals; it is also dotted irregularly\r\nwith white. By these characters it may be known from the other species\r\nof the genus, with which it appears to have been associated by\r\nLinnaeus, under the common name of Lophius Histrio. It was first\r\nscientifically distinguished by M. Bosc, a French naturalist, who\r\nobserved it, on his voyage to America, among the Sargasso weed: he\r\ndescribed and figured it, not without some imperfections, in the\r\nNouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle. It has since been figured,\r\nbut not described, by Dr. Mitchell in the Transactions of the New York\r\nSociety; and one very nearly resembling it has been described by Mr.\r\nBennett with a figure, in the Geological Journal. The genus to which\r\nit belongs is most completely treated of by M. Cuvier, in the Memoires\r\ndu Museum d'Histoire Naturelle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT BIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuvier]\r\n\r\n\r\nCuvier, the great naturalist, paid the debt of nature in May last,\r\nafter a life devoted to science with an unwearied application and a\r\nsuccess exceeded by none in modern times. He was born at Montbelliard\r\nin 1769, a year which gave to so many remarkable men--a Napoleon--a\r\nChateaubriand--a Wellington--a Humboldt, &c. and his first discoveries\r\nwere on the Mollusca, and shook to its base the zoological\r\nclassification which then universally prevailed.\r\n\r\nInvited to Paris to fill the place of Professor of Comparative Anatomy\r\nat the _Jardin des Plantes_, his lectures speedily drew crowds around\r\nhim, attracted by his popular eloquence and lucid arrangement. His\r\nnext work, _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, 1805, was rewarded by the\r\nInstitute with the decennial prize for the work which had contributed\r\nthe most to our knowledge of the Natural Sciences during that period.\r\nAt the same period he published a series of Memoirs on the Anatomy of\r\nthe Mollusca, and devoted his attention to a detailed examination\r\nof the fossil remains of the bones of mammiferous animals; he\r\nparticularly examined the numerous fossils in the environs of Paris,\r\nassisted in the geological part of his task by his friend M. A.\r\nBrogniart. The sagacity and accuracy which M. Cuvier displayed in the\r\nexamination of fossil bones, raised this branch of inquiry to the\r\ndignity of a perfectly new science, which has thrown a powerful light\r\non geology, and directed it into a more philosophical route. A\r\nnumber of works and of elaborate memoirs published since by various\r\nnaturalists, have shown the prodigious influence which the labours of\r\nCuvier have exercised on the study of geology, of the animal kingdom,\r\nand even of fossil botany. M. Cuvier amused himself during these\r\nlaborious works by particular researches which would alone have been\r\nsufficient to have distinguished any other man, such as his five\r\nMemoirs on the Voice of Birds, on Crocodiles, and on numerous subjects\r\nof zoology; such also as his descriptions of the living animals in\r\nthe menagerie, &c. In all his works, even to the minutest details,\r\nwe discover the same luminous, clear, and methodical mind, and the\r\nsagacity which characterized him. Feeling the want of a work\r\nwhich should present a general view of his ideas on zoological\r\nclassification, he published in 1817 his work entitled _Le Regne\r\nAnimal distribue d'après son Organisation_, in 4 vols, 8vo. which\r\nspeedily became the text-book of all zoological students. When\r\nemployed on this work he felt how far in arrear of the other branches\r\nof zoology was that which respects the class of fish, and saw how much\r\ndifficulty had accumulated in it, as well from our ignorance of the\r\nanatomy of these animals, and the impossibility of determining with\r\nprecision the laws of their comparative organization, as from the want\r\nof large collections, and perhaps also from the too artificial spirit\r\nwhich had hitherto prevailed in ichthyology. He employed his influence\r\nto form a collection in the Paris Museum of specimens of fish from all\r\nparts of the world, and was so successful in his endeavours that the\r\nnumber of specimens which at first scarcely amounted to 1,000, in a\r\nfew years amounted to 6,000. Of these he dissected a large portion\r\nwith a care hitherto unknown, having the advantage of an able\r\nassociate in the study of the details in M. Valenciennes; he was thus\r\nenabled in a period of time that may be called short, looking to the\r\nextent of the results, to collect the materials of his great _Histoire\r\nNaturelle des Poissons_, of which eight volumes have appeared, with\r\ntheir appropriate plates, and for the continuation of which we have to\r\nlook to his laborious assistant. The recent embarrassment among the\r\nParis publishers having occasioned a stoppage in the progress of this\r\nwork, M. Cuvier availed himself of this (as the part prepared for the\r\npress was already in advance of the printer) to make preparations\r\nfor republishing his _Lecons d'Anotomie Comparee_, of which a second\r\nedition had been long anxiously called for. This design, however, he\r\nwas not permitted to complete; but it is to be hoped that we shall not\r\nbe long deprived of the edition he had contemplated, and that it will\r\nbe accompanied with those beautiful and accurate plates on which he\r\nhad bestowed so much pains, and in the execution of which he himself\r\nexcelled; for he was a skilful draftsman, and seized external forms\r\nwith rapidity and accuracy, and possessed the art of representing\r\nin his drawings the forms of organic tissues in a style peculiar to\r\nhimself. His last course of lectures, on the History of the Natural\r\nSciences, and on the Philosophy of Natural History, delivered at the\r\nCollege of France, is now publishing in livraisons, and will extend\r\nto three or four vols, 8vo. This work, however, we believe, has been\r\npublished without his consent or revision. His memory was prodigious,\r\nand he scarcely knew what it was to forget anything. Although his\r\ngreat powers were more particularly devoted to natural history, no\r\npart of science was a stranger to him, and his taste for literature\r\nand works of imagination was particularly refined and elegant. In his\r\n_Eloges_ of illustrious men, delivered in his capacity of perpetual\r\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences, he always displays the utmost\r\nimpartiality and love of truth; he never debased the dignity\r\nof science by any love of intrigue, and displayed the utmost\r\ndisinterestedness in his efforts to promote science. The qualities\r\nof his heart were not less estimable than those of his head, and he\r\npossessed the happy art of inspiring his friends with an unalterable\r\nattachment. His conversation was varied and animated, adapted by turns\r\nto every subject, and he may truly be said to have been the grace and\r\nornament of society. We must not forget the great services he rendered\r\nto public education as head of the University; his Report on the\r\nState of Primary Education in Holland is a lasting monument of his\r\nsolicitude for the education of the people, and all those who have\r\nobserved his conduct with regard to the higher branches of education,\r\nknow how constantly his influence was directed to favour their\r\nprogress and to remove obstacles. In other departments of the civil\r\nservice into which he was successively called, as Master of Requests,\r\nCounsellor of State, President of the Section of the Interior,\r\nDirector of Protestant Worship, (for he was an enlightened and liberal\r\nProtestant, and watched over the interests of his co-religionists with\r\nconstant solicitude,) and at last as a Peer of France--in all these he\r\ndisplayed the same superiority of talent. The office of Censor of the\r\nPress, which was offered to him, he, to his eternal honour, refused.\r\nSuch was the man whose loss the world has now to deplore: but the mind\r\nthat traced her age and history--in the wrecks of ages dug from her\r\nbosom--will live for ever in his works to enlighten and instruct\r\nmankind.--_Foreign Quarterly Review._\r\n\r\nCuvier is said to have died of a paralytic affection of the\r\noesophagus. His body was examined by several eminent pathologists:\r\nhis brain is stated to have presented a mass of extraordinary volume,\r\nweighing three pounds thirteen and a half ounces; a fact which will\r\nbe treasured up by contemporary phrenologists as evidence of Cuvier's\r\ngreat intellectual capabilities.\r\n\r\n[Cuvier was Professor of Geology in the College of France. The chair,\r\nvacant by his death, has just been filled by the appointment of\r\nM. Elie Beaumont, celebrated for his investigation of mountain\r\nformations.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGENDS OF THE RHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [These are three novel-sized volumes from the prolific pen of Mr.\r\n    Grattan, whose _Highways and Byeways_ have probably started off\r\n    hundreds of scribbling tourists to the Continent, much to the\r\n    annoyance of the keepers of old castles and other necromantic\r\n    haunts. These Legends, however, have little to do with the Rhine,\r\n    which is perhaps fortunate for their success, as most of the\r\n    traditionary stories of the romantic river have been dished up in\r\n    as many forms and fashions as French cooks are accustomed to serve\r\n    up eggs. A few of our Correspondents have tried their taste,\r\n    but we hope not the reader's patience, in _Rhin_-onomy; and Mr.\r\n    Planché, moreover, has wandered and sailed up and down the\r\n    district, picking to new van its mystic stories in every form\r\n    common to our literature. We have enjoyed every inch of the stream\r\n    and its banks, coloured after nature, in a panorama on paper, to\r\n    put into your pocket or portmanteau; and just now Views on the\r\n    Rhine are publishing in sixpenny portions, and becoming as little\r\n    rare as Views on the Thames; till we may as well say thick as\r\n    leaves on the Rhine, as in Vallainbrosa.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Grattan's Legends are stated to be freely adapted from the\r\n    literature of the countries where the scenes are laid. They\r\n    consist of some ten or dozen stories of untiring length but too\r\n    much for entire extract. For the sake of some delightfully\r\n    graphic writing we are induced to quote a portion of one of the\r\n    tales--_The Curse of the Black Lady_, a legend of the twelfth\r\n    century. The scene lies in the Low Countries, and introduces an\r\n    admirably-drawn portrait of a knight of the period.]\r\n\r\nThe Castle of the Countess of Hainault at Mons was a complete specimen\r\nof the splendid architecture of the twelfth century, or that which\r\nis now called Gothic; pointed windows abounding in coloured glass,\r\nunpolished marble, heavy wooden doors, thickly studded with iron\r\nnails, leading into immense corridors, interminable passages, and\r\nbranching staircases.\r\n\r\nIt was early in a morning of the month of February, that the horn of a\r\nknight was heard beyond the castle wall, and immediately replied to\r\nby the warder; and when the draw-bridge was slowly replaced and the\r\nportcullis heavily withdrawn, a knight followed by a squire, whose\r\nsurcoat bore the Flander's lion, entered. The cap of the knight was\r\nof black velvet, and slight bars of steel, bent into the form of a\r\nsemicircle, crossed each other at the top of his head and served at\r\nonce for defence and for ornament. His boots of thick leather reaching\r\nalmost to the knees bespoke him an inhabitant of a maritime country,\r\nhaving spurs formed of a single point of iron, long and obtuse, and\r\nthese being gilt would have announced the wearer's rank in chivalry,\r\neven if his whole equipment and bearing had not proclaimed his right\r\nto the deference with which he was received. As he dismounted from his\r\nhorse, he threw off the large mantle, not unlike the military cloaks\r\nof our days, and discovered the knightly armour, which showed to\r\npeculiar advantage his powerful limbs. A straight black tunic without\r\nsleeves descended to his knees. It was fastened by a silver girdle,\r\nfrom which depended on one side a strong sword, and on the other a\r\ndagger, the richly wrought handle of which seemed to declare it of\r\nTurkish make. His arms and hands were covered with a steel tissue,\r\nsitting close and so flexible that it yielded lightly to every motion.\r\nThe squire who followed him was old, and a certain familiarity was\r\nmingled with the respect of his manner, and seemed to declare that he\r\nhad been long accustomed to his master. In truth he had served\r\nthe father of our knight, and the latter had grown up beneath his\r\nattendance, which had not unfrequently become his protection. His\r\narmour, far from adorning his person, scarcely left a human figure\r\nvisible beneath its heavy plates of iron, fastened by nails whose\r\nmonstrous heads seemed cast in the same mould with those which\r\nstrengthened the heavy oak doors of the palace. His helmet seemed the\r\nsection of a water-pipe of cast iron. Visor it had none; but in its\r\nplace was a plate or bar of iron descending from the forehead to the\r\nchin, almost touching the nose and mouth, and he had a group of arms\r\nsuspended from his saddle. It was Sir Guy de Dampierre and his squire.\r\n\r\nThe seneschal conducted them with much ceremony to the knight's\r\napartments in the castle, where a small table placed by the side of an\r\nenormous log-fire in the middle of the room, and plentifully furnished\r\nwith cold salted and dried meats, together with the thin wines of\r\nFrance, and the more potent juice of the German grape, soon made him\r\nforget the cold and thirst he had endured in the forest. The beer he\r\nquaffed with peculiar pleasure, as it invitingly foamed in a silver\r\ntankard, which had been thickly embossed by the abbot of Wansfort, and\r\npresented by him to the Emperor Baldwin previous to his embarkation\r\nfor the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nHaving praised the flavour of the beer and helped himself to some\r\nslices from a well cured wild boar's head, he said to the chamberlain,\r\n\"And Baldwin of Avesnes is not yet arrived, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Count,\" replied the chamberlain; \"we expected he would be with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, my road lay through Namur, and he comes directly from Bruges. I\r\nmarvel therefore he be not arrived--and I have news for him,\" said the\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n    [The next page includes a passing notice of the _introduction of\r\n    chimneys_ into England, referable, though not without dispute, to\r\n    this date:--]\r\n\r\nThe warder's horn was again heard; and after due time the person in\r\nquestion made his appearance. He looked harassed and fatigued, and\r\ngladly took the seat Count Guy pointed to, close by his own, and\r\nhaving stirred the logs which burned lazily in the huge hearth, he\r\nobserved, \"Methinks the wood emits this sulphureous vapour more\r\nstrongly than ever. I marvel, Guy, that you have not repaid the\r\ncompliment of the English king's invitation to your weavers, by\r\nbringing over workmen to build you some of those long narrow passages\r\nwhich, beginning just over the fire, project from the top of the house\r\nto carry off the smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, Baldwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, have you not heard that in England they are beginning to build\r\nalong the end of the rooms, lodges or troughs to contain the fuel, on\r\nthe base of which they raise a brick funnel, through which all the\r\nsmoke mounts and so evaporates at the top of the house?\" replied\r\nBaldwin.\r\n\r\n\"Think you then, d'Avesnes, that the whole room can be warmed with the\r\nfire at one end of it, particularly if the smoke be carried out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed they say,\" replied d'Avesnes, \"it casts a strong heat\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n    [\"The Black Lady\" is thus characterised:--\"They speak of her as\r\n    one entirely destitute of natural sensibility; they hint at some\r\n    dark practices, and they designate her so frequently by the\r\n    epithet of the 'Black Lady,' that many, both in Hainault and\r\n    Flanders, are ignorant that this is not really her title.\" Here\r\n    follows a whole-length portrait of this specimen of black-letter\r\n    majesty.]\r\n\r\nIn the tapestried room into which the brothers were conducted, sat\r\nthe Black Lady of Brabant on a throne elevated considerably above\r\nthe floor. The dais was covered with the same rich tapestry as the\r\nhangings which covered the walls, for even in this early age Bruges\r\nwas celebrated for such manufactures. The draperies of the throne were\r\nof purple velvet fringed with gold, with a canopy and curtains of the\r\nsame rich materials, the latter being looped back with a massive cord\r\nand tassels. The constable supported one side of the throne, and\r\nthe seneschal the other. Below these were the cup-bearer and grand\r\nhuntsman. Six pages were placed about the steps of the throne, and\r\nthe same number of ladies in waiting were also there. Yet Marguerite\r\nherself wanted not the surrounding magnificence to mark her superior\r\ndignity of \"Countess by the grace of God,\" then accorded to only one\r\ncounty besides her own; for there was a sort of fearful majesty about\r\nher towering height, unbowed either by the weight of years (and she\r\nhad already passed what the Psalmist has declared to be the age of\r\nman) or luxurious indulgence. Her face was pale and marked by deep\r\nfurrows, indicating an unlimited indulgence of the strong passions\r\nwhich had rendered her life so unquiet. Her eye was black, and\r\nretained all the fire of lively feeling, yet it was sunken. Her\r\nforehead was low, yet there was an inflexibility of resolve in\r\nits deep lines that added much to the majestic character of her\r\nappearance. Her teeth too were perfect, and her thin and colourless\r\nlips left them visible to attract the painful admiration excited by\r\ntheir contrast with the unlovely expression of her features; her chin\r\nwas small. Her hair was all drawn from her face to the crown of her\r\nhead and concealed under the black lace veil, which concealing the\r\nupper part of her forehead, fell over each shoulder even to her feet.\r\nHer upper garment was a long mantle of black velvet lined with ermine,\r\nwhich, opening in front, fell over the arms of her throne, and\r\ndiscovered a dress of crimson cloth of Bruges of that beautiful sort\r\ncalled _ecarlate_. The boddice was drawn tightly to her shape by\r\nrich gold cord, the ends of which, finished by heavy tassels, fell\r\ndownwards to the edge of her robe. The crimson tunic reached only to\r\nher knees, and discovered an under dress of white Syrian silk, on\r\nwhich was a border of gold, evidently of oriental workmanship. Her\r\nhard bust was covered by many rows of the finest Asiatic pearls, and\r\ndepending from her girdle was a rosary of jet, which sustained a\r\nrichly embossed golden cross, probably enshrining a piece of wood of\r\nthe true cross from Palestine. The small gold crown which circled\r\nher brows, and the sceptre she held, were evidently made by the same\r\nskilful artist--probably the work of the celebrated Erembert, Abbot\r\nof Wansfort. Her arms, which notwithstanding her towering statue were\r\ndisproportionably long, were covered by sleeves of the finest Bruges\r\nlinen, which however only appeared at the shoulders and elbows, the\r\nrest of the arm being covered with the crimson cloth which formed the\r\ntunic, and these were laced with gold cord down to the waist, where\r\nthe Bruges linen formed a cuff. Her form was harsh and bony, and no\r\ngrace of motion relieved its outlines; for she was so fearfully still,\r\nyou might have thought the living form had been placed in sight of the\r\nGorgon's head and so transformed to stone. Her features seemed alike\r\nimmovable, all sunk into a dark, fixed, and settled discontent with\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [This is the seventeenth volume of the _Library of Entertaining\r\n    Knowledge_; and, like the majority of its predecessors, it aims\r\n    at rendering popular, and of obvious interest, subjects which had\r\n    hitherto been abstruse and uninviting. It is the first of a series\r\n    of volumes to be published on the Antiquities of the British\r\n    Museum, so as in some measure to set them free from their national\r\n    imprisonment; for such we must term any assemblage of works of art\r\n    (the property of the country), which are not unconditionally open\r\n    to public inspection.\r\n\r\n    The portion before us is the first of two volumes devoted to\r\n    the Egyptian Antiquities in the Museum. It has been diligently\r\n    compiled; and rendered more interesting than would be a bare\r\n    account of what the Museum contains, by correct notices generally\r\n    \"of the history of art among the Egyptians.\" The best authorities\r\n    have been consulted and acknowledged, as Hamilton, Heeren, Gau,\r\n    and Belzoni, and the more recent labours of Mr. James Burton.\r\n    The whole is attractively arranged in chapters; on the Physical\r\n    Character of Egypt; Political Sketch of Ancient Egypt, and the\r\n    monuments of the respective divisions of the country. We subjoin\r\n    an extract, containing a graphic outline of _Thebes_:]\r\n\r\nWe pass by Kennéh, on the east bank, from which travellers may go to\r\nCosseir to embark on the Red Sea; we hasten by the remains of Kouft,\r\nthe ancient Coptos, and the solitary propylon of Kous, standing alone\r\nwithout its temple,--to the plain of Thebes, to the most wonderful\r\nassemblage of ruins on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAll travellers agree that it is impossible to describe the effect\r\nproduced by the colossal remains of this ancient capital; nor does it\r\nlie within our plan to attempt this description at present any farther\r\nthan is necessary to make our readers acquainted with the general\r\ncharacter and localities of the existing temples of Egypt.\r\n\r\nNo knowledge of antiquity, no long-cherished associations, no\r\nsearching after something to admire, is necessary here. The wonders of\r\nThebes rise before the astonished spectator like the creations of some\r\nsuperior power. \"It appeared to me,\" says Belzoni, \"like entering\r\na city of giants, who, after a long conflict, were all destroyed,\r\nleaving the ruins of their various temples as the only proofs of their\r\nformer existence.\" Denon's description of the first view of Thebes by\r\nthe French army, which he accompanied in the expedition into Upper\r\nEgypt, is singularly characteristic. \"On turning the point of a chain\r\nof mountains which forms a kind of promontory, we saw all at once\r\nancient Thebes in its full extent--that Thebes whose magnitude has\r\nbeen pictured to us by a single word in Homer, _hundred-gated_, a\r\npoetical and unmeaning expression which has been so confidently\r\nrepeated ever since. This city, described in a few pages dictated\r\nto Herodotus by Egyptian priests, which succeeding authors have\r\ncopied--renowned for numerous kings, who, through their wisdom, have\r\nbeen elevated to the rank of gods; for laws which have been revered\r\nwithout being known; for sciences which have been confided to proud\r\nand mysterious inscriptions, wise and earliest monuments of the arts\r\nwhich time has respected;--this sanctuary, abandoned, desolated\r\nthrough barbarism, and surrendered to the desert from which it was\r\nwon; this city, shrouded in the veil of mystery by which even colossi\r\nare magnified: this remote city, which imagination has only caught a\r\nglimpse of through the darkness of time,--was still so gigantic an\r\napparition, that at the site of its scattered ruins, the army halted\r\nof its own accord, and the soldiers, with one spontaneous movement,\r\nclapped their hands.\" It is, however, rather unfortunate for Denon's\r\ndescription, that another traveller denies that there is such an\r\napproach to Thebes as is mentioned in the extract, and he assures us\r\nthat the ruins cannot be seen till the traveller comes near them; and\r\nfurther, that to produce such astonishing effects as the Frenchman\r\ndescribes, we ought to be _very_ near them or _among_ them. Without\r\npretending to reconcile these contradictions, we can readily believe\r\nthat the ruins may produce a considerable effect, even at some\r\ndistance, if Denon's drawings are at all correct. As to the impression\r\nmade by a near inspection of these wonderful remains, there is no\r\ndiscrepancy among travellers.\r\n\r\nThebes lay on each side of the river, and extended also on both sides\r\nas far as the mountains. The tombs, which are on the western side,\r\nreach even into the limits of the desert. Four principal villages\r\nstand on the site of this ancient city,--Luxor and Carnak on the\r\neastern, Gournou and Medinet-Abou on the western side. The temple of\r\nLuxor is very near the river, and there is here a good ancient jettée,\r\nwell built of bricks. The entrance to this temple is through a\r\nmagnificent propylon, or gateway, facing the north, 200 feet in front,\r\nand 57 feet high above the present level of the soil. Before the\r\ngateway stand the two most perfect obelisks that exist, formed, as\r\nusual, of the red granite of Syene, and each about 80 feet high,\r\nand from 8 to 10 feet wide at the base. Travellers differ in their\r\nestimate of the width of the base, some, perhaps, taking the actual\r\nmeasure on the surface of the soil while others may make allowance\r\nfor that part that is buried; for that the soil is much elevated will\r\nappear from what follows: \"Between these obelisks and the propylon are\r\ntwo colossal statutes, also of red granite; from the difference of\r\nthe dresses it is judged that one was a male, the other a female,\r\nfigure;--they are nearly of equal sizes. Though buried in the ground\r\nto the chest, they still measure 21 and 22 feet from thence to the top\r\nof the mitre.\" Another cause of discrepancy in the measurements\r\nmay be, that the adjacent sides of the obelisks are of different\r\ndimensions; which is generally the case.\r\n\r\nIt is this gateway that is filled with those remarkable sculptures,\r\nwhich represent the triumph of some ancient monarch of Egypt over an\r\nAsiatic enemy, and which we find repeated, both on other monuments of\r\nThebes, and partly also on some of the monuments of Nubia, as, for\r\nexample, at Ipsambul. This event appears to have formed an epoch\r\nin Egyptian history, and to have furnished materials both for the\r\nhistorian and the sculptor, like the war of Troy to the Grecian poet.\r\nThe whole length of this temple is about 800 feet.\r\n\r\nBut the remains of Carnak, about one mile and a quarter lower down the\r\nriver, are still more wonderful than Luxor: one of the buildings is\r\nprobably the temple of Ammon, which we know from Diodoius was on this\r\nside of the river. An irregular avenue of sphinxes, considerably\r\nmore than a mile in length (about 6,560 feet), connected the northern\r\nentrance of the temple of Luxor with it; but this was only one\r\nof several proud approaches to perhaps the largest assemblage of\r\nbuildings that ever was erected. For a minute description of Carnak\r\nwe must refer to the plans in the great French work, and to Dr.\r\nRichardson's and Mr. Hamilton's accounts. The irregularities in the\r\nstructure and approaches of this building show that the various parts\r\nof it were raised at different periods, for indeed it would have been\r\nimpossible for any one sovereign to have completed such a monument in\r\nhis life-time; and we know, also, that the great temple at Memphis\r\nreceived numerous additions during a long succession of ages. Some\r\nparts, both of this temple and of the larger building at Carnak\r\n(sometimes called a palace), have been constructed out of the\r\nmaterials of earlier buildings, as we see from blocks of stone being\r\noccasionally placed with inverted hieroglyphics. It is impossible\r\nwithout good drawings and very long descriptions, to give anything\r\nlike an adequate idea of the enormous remains of Carnak, among which\r\nwe find a hall whose roof of flat stones is sustained by more than\r\n130 pillars, some 26 feet, and others as much as 34 feet, in\r\ncircumference. The remains on the western side of the river are,\r\nperhaps, more interesting than those on the east. That nearly all\r\nthe monuments of Thebes belong to a period anterior to the Persian\r\nconquest, B.C. 525, and that among them we must look for the oldest\r\nand most genuine specimens of Egyptian art, is clear, both from the\r\ncharacter of the monuments themselves and from historical records; nor\r\nis this conviction weakened by finding the name of Alexander twice on\r\npart of the buildings at Carnak, which will prove no more than that\r\na chamber might have been added to the temple and inscribed with his\r\nname; or that it was not unusual for the priests to flatter conquerors\r\nor conquerors' deputies by carving on stone the name of their new\r\nmaster. Thebes was the centre of Egyptian power and commerce, probably\r\nlong before Memphis grew into importance, or before the Delta was made\r\nsuitable to the purposes of husbandry by the cutting of canals and the\r\nraising of embankments.\r\n\r\n    [In a note to this passage, it is stated that \"Herodotus has given\r\n    no description of Thebes. Denon several times quotes Herodotus\r\n    for what is not in that author. But this is so common, even with\r\n    people who have claims to scholarship, that it has become almost\r\n    a fashion to say that any thing is in Herodotus.\" So that the\r\n    audience of Lord Goderich with the late King, as described in the\r\n    _Edinburgh Review_, in the Herodotean (or _says_ he and _says\r\n    she_) dialect, is no great license.]\r\n\r\n    [The volume is profusely embellished.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC JOURNALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nERRORS OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe devoutest believers in \"the march of intellect\" must at intervals\r\nbe almost driven to renounce their creed in despair. Errors which were\r\nsupposed to have been exploded centuries ago, sometimes reappear on a\r\nsudden, and propagate themselves for a season with a rapidity which no\r\nreasoning can pursue, no ridicule arrest. Notions, worthy only of the\r\ndark ages, spring up in the glare of the supposed illumination of the\r\npresent day, and resist all the efforts of the Briarean press itself\r\nto dispel them. At one time, it is a pious Hungarian prince who\r\nperforms preternatural cures, at the request of the friends of the\r\nsick parties in Ireland, conveyed through that droll medium for a\r\nmiracle, the Hamburg letter-bag! At another, it is an old dropsical\r\nimpostor, whom thousands of blaspheming dupes venerate as a second\r\nvirgin quick of a new Messiah! A short time since animal magnetism\r\nwas in vogue; and the strong will of certain gifted individuals was\r\nbelieved to have the power of entering into a mystical communication\r\nwith the spirits of others, and of absolutely controlling their whole\r\nphysical and mental being! To-day we are startled by the actual\r\nexhibition of a miracle, the \"unknown tongue,\" on alternate Sundays,\r\nat the Caledonian Chapel in Regent Square, London! If at any time we\r\nare tempted to plume ourselves on the fact, that the belief in ghosts\r\nand witchcraft has disappeared, we are quickly humiliated by the\r\nrecollection that there are yet thousands of devout believers in\r\nthe prophecies of Francis Moore, physician; or by overhearing the\r\nrhapsodies of some millenarian dreamer, who as confidently gives us\r\nthe date of the opening of the New Jerusalem as if he were speaking of\r\nthe New London Bridge.--_Quarterly Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC CREDIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is physically impossible to carry on the commerce of the civilized\r\nworld by the aid of a _purely_ metallic currency--no, not though our\r\ngold and silver coins were every tenth year debased to a tenth! Why,\r\nin London alone, five millions of money are daily exchanged at the\r\nClearing-house, in the course of a few hours. We should like to\r\nsee the attempt made to bring this infinity of transactions to a\r\nsettlement in coined money. Credit money, in some shape or other,\r\nalways has, and must have, performed the part of a circulating\r\nmedium to a very considerable extent. And (by one of those wonderful\r\ncompensatory processes which so frequently claim the admiration of\r\nevery investigator of civil, as well as of physical economy) there\r\nis in the nature of credit an elasticity which causes it, when left\r\nunshackled by law, to adapt itself to the necessities of commerce, and\r\nthe legitimate demands of the market. Well may the productive classes\r\nexclaim to those who persist in legislating on the subject, and are\r\nnot content without determining who may, and who may not, give credit\r\nto another, what kind of monied obligations shall, or shall not, be\r\nallowed to circulate--that is, to be taken in exchange for goods at\r\nthe option of the parties--well might they exclaim, as the merchants\r\nof Paris did to the minister of Louis, when he asked what his master\r\ncould do for them--\"Laissez nous faire,\"--\"Leave us alone, to surround\r\nourselves with those precautions which experience will suggest and the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation put in execution.\"--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOARDING MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt too that \"_hoarding_\" coin goes on to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and greatly augments the scarcity, and\r\nconsequently the value of the precious metals. Even the old practice\r\nof \"making a stocking\" is by no means given up in rural districts. We\r\nourselves, but a few days back, personally witnessed an old crone,\r\nthe wife of a small, and apparently poor farmer, in a wild pastoral\r\ndistrict, bring no less than three hundred sovereigns in a bag to a\r\nneighbouring attorney, to be placed by him in security: her treasure\r\nhaving accumulated till she was afraid to keep it longer at home. Such\r\nexamples are by no means so rare as may be imagined. The failures of\r\nso many country banks in 1825 destroyed the confidence of country\r\npeople in the bank-notes of the present banks, and causes their\r\npreference of gold. The failure of many attorneys, as well as of those\r\ncountry banks which received and gave interest on deposits, and (with\r\nthe exception of the savings banks, which are very limited in the\r\namount of the deposits they allow) the total absence, in the rural\r\ndistricts of England, of any safe and accessible depositaries for the\r\nsavings of the economical, such as the invaluable Scotch banks,\r\nhave tended most injuriously to discourage economy; and where that\r\nprinciple was strongly ingrafted, have converted it into a practice of\r\nhoarding,--have caused that to stagnate in unprofitable masses which,\r\nspread through proper channels, would have stimulated new industry and\r\nnew accumulations, and added both to the wealth of the owner, and to\r\nthe general stock.--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF PRINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Our Correspondent, W.M. of the Regent's Park, should read the\r\n    following announcement, which supersedes the necessity of printing\r\n    his communication. At least, we do not feel ourselves justified in\r\n    doing so, without reference to the undernamed German work.]\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to erect a monument in Mentz, by public subscription\r\nand support of all nations, to Gutenberg, the great inventor of the\r\nart of printing, and to celebrate the immortal discovery in a grand\r\nand becoming style. The erection is to take place in 1836, being the\r\nfourth centenary anniversary of the great achievement, for it is\r\ncapable of historic proof that Gutenberg communicated his discovery of\r\nmovable letters to some friends at Strasburg in 1436, to which city he\r\nhad retired on account of some disturbances in his native place: vide\r\nSchaab's _Geschichte der Erfinding der Buchdruckerkunst_, Mainz,\r\n1831, 3 vols. 8vo. The subscriptions and support, in particular, of\r\nprinters, booksellers, authors and literary bodies, is solicited.\r\nKings and princes, in behalf of the best interests of their subjects\r\nand of civilization, it is hoped, will not be backward to support so\r\nnoble a design. The public will be informed, from time to time,\r\nby means of the daily papers and journals, of the progress of the\r\nsubscription, for which the smallest sums will be received, and the\r\nnames of the donors entered in a book kept by the Corporation\r\nof Mentz, to which all communications are requested to be\r\naddressed.--_Foreign Quarterly Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE\r\n\r\n\r\nA medal, in commemoration of Goethe, has been struck at Berlin. On one\r\nside is the portrait of the deceased, by the celebrated Leonard Posch,\r\ncrowned with laurel, bearing the inscription Jo. W. DE GOETHE NAT.\r\nXXVIII AUG. MDCCXXXXIX. The likeness was taken a few years ago at\r\nWeimar, and has been universally admired for its accuracy. On the\r\nreverse is represented the Poet's Apotheosis. A swan bears him on his\r\nwings to the starry regions, that appear expanded above, and to which\r\nthe Poet, having a golden lyre in his left arm, extends his right arm\r\nwith longing gaze. On this side is the inscription AD ASTRA REDIIT D.\r\nXXII MART. MDCCCXXXIL--_Ibid_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GATHERER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ Wilkes's Luckiest Number_.--A rich farmer in Devonshire made a will,\r\nin which the following article was found:--\"I bequeath to John\r\nWilkes, late member of parliament for Aylesbury, five thousand pounds\r\nsterling, as a grateful return for the courage with which he defended\r\nthe liberty of his country, and opposed the dangerous progress of\r\narbitrary power.\"\r\n\r\n_Owen's Alms-houses, Islington_, were founded by Dame Alice Owen, in\r\nconsequence of a providential escape. In the fields, near this spot,\r\nin the reign of Queen Mary, the archers frequently exercised with bows\r\nand arrows. Dame Owen walking with her maid, and observing a woman\r\nmilking a cow, was desirous of trying to milk the cow herself, which\r\nshe did, when on leaving the cow, an arrow pierced the crown of her\r\nhat, without doing her the least injury. In gratitude for her escape,\r\nshe built the school and houses. For many years an arrow was fixed on\r\nthe top of them. SWAINE.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Tory_.--Our friend, Mr. George Olaus Borrow, who has\r\ndevoted his attention specially to the Celtic dialect, suggests that\r\nthe long-disputed etymology of the word Tory may be traced to the\r\nIrish adherents of Charles II., during the Cromwellian era. The words\r\n_Tar a Ri_ (pronounced _Tory_,) and meaning _Come, O King_, having\r\nbeen so constantly in the mouths of the Royalists as to have become\r\na by-word to designate them. Mr. Borrow's paper on the subject has\r\nappeared in the _Norfolk Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n_Toast_.--May the man who wins a woman's heart never be instrumental\r\nin breaking its peace.\r\n\r\n          _Progress of Life_.\r\n\r\n  When man full thirty years has spent,\r\n    The road at times both rough and stony,\r\n  To clear life's vapour, and repent\r\n    He seeks the stream of Matrimony!\r\n\r\n_Caught at last_.--Sir Jervis Elwayes, lieutenant of the Tower, being\r\nmuch addicted to gaming, used to say, in his prayers, \"Lord, let me\r\nhanged, if ever I play more.\" He broke this serious prayer a thousand\r\ntimes, and at last was hanged on Tower Hill, in 1615, for the murder\r\nof Sir Thomas Overbury.\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor took great delight in Haverley Bower, in Essex,\r\nit being woody, solitary, and fit for devotion; but it so abounded\r\nwith warbling nightingales, that they disturbed him in his devotions.\r\nHe earnestly prayed for their absence, since which time it is\r\nsuperstitiously said, never nightingale was heard to sing in the park,\r\nthough occasionally the warbler is heard outside the pales.\r\n\r\n_Wages_.--In 1352, (25th Edward III.) the wages paid to haymakers was\r\n1d. a-day; a mower of meadows, 3d. a-day, or 5d. an acre; reapers of\r\ncorn in the first week of August, 2d., in the second 3d. per day, and\r\nso on till the end of August, without meat, drink, or other allowance;\r\nfinding their own tools. For threshing a quarter of wheat or rye,\r\n2-1/2d.; a quarter of barley, beans, peas, and oats, 1-1/2d. A master\r\ncarpenter, 3d. per day, other carpenters 2d. A master mason 4d. per\r\nday, other masons 3_d_., and their servants 1-1/2d. per day. Tilers\r\n3d., and their \"knaves\" 1-1/2d. Thatchers 3d. a-day, and their knaves\r\n1-1/2d. Plasterers, and other workers of mud walls and their knaves\r\nin like manner, without meat or drink, and this from Easter to\r\nMichaelmas; and from that time less, according to the direction of the\r\njustices. T. GILL.\r\n\r\n_Literary Quizzing_.--Of all human quizzing, ancient and modern,\r\nplebeian or patrician, nothing equals that now in triumphant practice\r\nin the lists of literature. From Zoilus to the penny newspapers, never\r\nhas there been criticism, penned or spoken, so bitterly pungent as\r\nsome of the grave laudatory articles, by which authors are now quizzed\r\ndown to zero in the popular reviews. Satan Montgomery is bantered with\r\nthe name of Isaiah; Miss Landon by a comparison with La Rochefoucault;\r\nand Don Trueba, with Pigault le Brun. This is a refinement in cruelty.\r\nIt is twining the rack with flowers; and hanging a man with a cord of\r\ngold. The sentence of the reviewer should be \"Yea, yea; and nay, nay!\"\r\nA Barmecide's feast of fame is a supererogation of malice. We hold\r\nthat all authors so derided have a right to call upon their critics\r\nto make good their words; and build up the visionary castles of their\r\n_Fata Morgana_, (like London Bridge in the nursery song) with \"gravel\r\nand stone;\" or rather, \"with silver and gold.\" A heavy mulct should be\r\nimposed on literary quizzing.--_Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_.\r\n\r\n_Cross Readings_, (_from the Spanish_.)--Suddenly King Alphonso\r\nRiberro Fernando rose from his couch, and sallying from his tent with\r\nfierce looks and sword in hand--swore the total annihilation of every\r\nbug in the Castiles.\r\n\r\nAnd the king with great despatch, forthwith ordered a strong body of\r\ncavalry, for--there was a mouse scratching behind the wainscot.\r\n\r\nSo the queen, Mary, rising majestically from her throne, with\r\nimperial, yet gentle look, exclaimed in a sweet voice--\"Scratch Poll's\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a goodly array of gay knights following the king to the\r\nhunt--the rats being numerous they afforded good sport.\r\n\r\nThese specimens of Spanish satire came out in the form of\r\ncross-readings, a few months after the death of Cervantes; they were\r\naffirmed to be by that illustrious author; how truly so I know not.\r\nR.N.\r\n\r\n_Cannon Clock_.--In the gardens of the Palais Royal and the\r\nLuxembourg, at Paris, is a specimen of this contrivance invented by\r\none Rousseau. A burning-glass is fixed over the vent of a cannon, so\r\nthat the sun's rays, at the moment of its passing the meridian, are\r\nconcentrated by the glass, on the priming, and the piece is fired. The\r\nburning-glass is regulated, for this purpose, every month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Printed and published by J.
