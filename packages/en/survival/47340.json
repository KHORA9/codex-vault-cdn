An earthquake is a\r\nsudden movement of the Earth, caused by the abrupt release of strain\r\nthat has accumulated over a long time. For hundreds of millions of\r\nyears, the forces of plate tectonics have shaped the Earth as the huge\r\nplates that form the Earth’s surface slowly move over, under, and past\r\neach other. Sometimes the movement is gradual. At other times, the\r\nplates are locked together, unable to release the accumulating energy.\r\nWhen the accumulated energy grows strong enough, the plates break free.\r\nIf the earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths\r\nand injuries and extensive property damage.\r\n\r\nToday we are challenging the assumption that earthquakes must present an\r\nuncontrollable and unpredictable hazard to life and property. Scientists\r\nhave begun to estimate the locations and likelihoods of future damaging\r\nearthquakes. Sites of greatest hazard are being identified, and definite\r\nprogress is being made in designing structures that will withstand the\r\neffects of earthquakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _USGS scientist uses portable seismic recording equipment\r\nnear Mount St. Helens, Washington._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Earthquakes in History\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientific study of earthquakes is comparatively new. Until the 18th\r\ncentury, few factual descriptions of earthquakes were recorded, and the\r\nnatural cause of earthquakes was little understood. Those who did look\r\nfor natural causes often reached conclusions that seem fanciful today;\r\none popular theory was that earthquakes were caused by air rushing out\r\nof caverns deep in the Earth’s interior.\r\n\r\nThe earliest earthquake for which we have descriptive information\r\noccurred in China in 1177 B.C. The Chinese earthquake catalog describes\r\nseveral dozen large earthquakes in China during the next few thousand\r\nyears. Earthquakes in Europe are mentioned as early as 580 B.C., but the\r\nearliest for which we have some descriptive information occurred in the\r\nmid-16th century. The earliest known earthquakes in the Americas were in\r\nMexico in the late 14th century and in Peru in 1471, but descriptions of\r\nthe effects were not well documented. By the 17th century, descriptions\r\nof the effects of earthquakes were being published around the\r\nworld—although these accounts were often exaggerated or distorted.\r\n\r\nThe most widely felt earthquakes in the recorded history of North\r\nAmerica were a series that occurred in 1811-12 near New Madrid, Mo. A\r\ngreat earthquake, whose magnitude is estimated to be about 8, occurred\r\non the morning of December 16, 1811. Another great earthquake occurred\r\non January 23, 1812, and a third, the strongest yet, on February 7,\r\n1812. Aftershocks were nearly continuous between these great earthquakes\r\nand continued for months afterwards. These earthquakes were felt by\r\npeople as far away as Boston and Denver. Because the most intense\r\neffects were in a sparsely populated region, the destruction of human\r\nlife and property was slight. If just one of these enormous earthquakes\r\noccurred in the same area today, millions of people and buildings and\r\nother structures worth billions of dollars would be affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The great 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire\r\ndestroyed most of the city and left 250,000 people homeless._]\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was one of the most destructive in\r\nthe recorded history of North America—the earthquake and the fire that\r\nfollowed killed nearly 700 people and left the city in ruins. The Alaska\r\nearthquake of March 27, 1964, was of greater magnitude than the San\r\nFrancisco earthquake; it released perhaps twice as much energy and was\r\nfelt over an area of almost 500,000 square miles. The ground motion near\r\nthe epicenter was so violent that the tops of some trees were snapped\r\noff. One hundred and fourteen people (some as far away as California)\r\ndied as a result of this earthquake, but loss of life and property would\r\nhave been far greater had Alaska been more densely populated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Where Earthquakes Occur\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earth is formed of several layers that have very different physical\r\nand chemical properties. The outer layer, which averages about 70\r\nkilometers in thickness, consists of about a dozen large, irregularly\r\nshaped plates that slide over, under, and past each other on top of the\r\npartly molten inner layer. Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries\r\nwhere the plates meet. In fact, the locations of earthquakes and the\r\nkinds of ruptures they produce help scientists define the plate\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of plate boundaries and earthquake locations.]\r\n\r\nThere are three types of plate boundaries: spreading zones, transform\r\nfaults, and subduction zones. At _spreading zones_, molten rock rises,\r\npushing two plates apart and adding new material at their edges. Most\r\nspreading zones are found in oceans; for example, the North American and\r\nEurasian plates are spreading apart along the mid-Atlantic ridge.\r\nSpreading zones usually have earthquakes at shallow depths (within 30\r\nkilometers of the surface).\r\n\r\n_Transform faults_ are found where plates slide past one another. An\r\nexample of a transform-fault plate boundary is the San Andreas fault,\r\nalong the coast of California and northwestern Mexico. Earthquakes at\r\ntransform faults tend to occur at shallow depths and form fairly\r\nstraight linear patterns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map explanation: yellow lines, plate Boundary.]\r\n\r\n_Subduction zones_ are found where one plate overrides, or subducts,\r\nanother, pushing it downward into the mantle where it melts. An example\r\nof a subduction-zone plate boundary is found along the northwest coast\r\nof the United States, western Canada, and southern Alaska and the\r\nAleutian Islands. Subduction zones are characterized by deep-ocean\r\ntrenches, shallow to deep earthquakes, and mountain ranges containing\r\nactive volcanoes.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes can also occur within plates, although plate-boundary\r\nearthquakes are much more common. Less than 10 percent of all\r\nearthquakes occur within plate interiors. As plates continue to move and\r\nplate boundaries change over geologic time, weakened boundary regions\r\nbecome part of the interiors of the plates. These zones of weakness\r\nwithin the continents can cause earthquakes in response to stresses that\r\noriginate at the edges of the plate or in the deeper crust. The New\r\nMadrid earthquakes of 1811-12 and the 1886 Charleston earthquake\r\noccurred within the North American plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Damaged house.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         How Earthquakes Happen\r\n\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is the vibration, sometimes violent, of the Earth’s\r\nsurface that follows a release of energy in the Earth’s crust. This\r\nenergy can be generated by a sudden dislocation of segments of the\r\ncrust, by a volcanic eruption, or even by manmade explosions. Most\r\ndestructive quakes, however, are caused by dislocations of the crust.\r\nThe crust may first bend and then, when the stress exceeds the strength\r\nof the rocks, break and “snap” to a new position. In the process of\r\nbreaking, vibrations called “seismic waves” are generated. These waves\r\ntravel outward from the source of the earthquake along the surface and\r\nthrough the Earth at varying speeds depending on the material through\r\nwhich they move. Some of the vibrations are of high enough frequency to\r\nbe audible, while others are of very low frequency. These vibrations\r\ncause the entire planet to quiver or ring like a bell or a tuning fork.\r\n\r\nA _fault_ is a fracture in the Earth’s crust along which two blocks of\r\nthe crust have slipped with respect to each other. Faults are divided\r\ninto three main groups, depending on how they move. _Normal faults_\r\noccur in response to pulling or tension; the overlying block moves down\r\nthe dip of the fault plane. _Thrust (reverse) faults_ occur in response\r\nto squeezing or compression; the overlying block moves up the dip of the\r\nfault plane. _Strike-slip (lateral) faults_ occur in response to either\r\ntype of stress; the blocks move horizontally past one another. Most\r\nfaulting along spreading zones is normal, along subduction zones is\r\nthrust, and along transform faults is strike-slip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Normal Fault. Blocks are pulled apart_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Thrust Fault. Blocks are pushed together_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Strike-Slip Fault. Blocks slide past each other_]\r\n\r\nGeologists have found that earthquakes tend to reoccur along faults,\r\nwhich reflect zones of weakness in the Earth’s crust. Even if a fault\r\nzone has recently experienced an earthquake, however, there is no\r\nguarantee that all the stress has been relieved. Another earthquake\r\ncould still occur. In New Madrid, a great earthquake was followed by a\r\nlarge aftershock within 6 hours on December 16, 1811. Furthermore,\r\nrelieving stress along one part of the fault may increase stress in\r\nanother part; the New Madrid earthquakes in January and February 1812\r\nmay have resulted from this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of Earth’s layers and seismic wave propagation.]\r\n\r\nThe _focal depth_ of an earthquake is the depth from the Earth’s surface\r\nto the region where an earthquake’s energy originates (the _focus_).\r\nEarthquakes with focal depths from the surface to about 70 kilometers\r\n(43.5 miles) are classified as shallow. Earthquakes with focal depths\r\nfrom 70 to 300 kilometers (43.5 to 186 miles) are classified as\r\nintermediate. The focus of deep earthquakes may reach depths of more\r\nthan 700 kilometers (435 miles). The focuses of most earthquakes are\r\nconcentrated in the crust and upper mantle. The depth to the center of\r\nthe Earth’s core is about 6,370 kilometers (3,960 miles), so even the\r\ndeepest earthquakes originate in relatively shallow parts of the Earth’s\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe _epicenter_ of an earthquake is the point on the Earth’s surface\r\ndirectly above the focus. The location of an earthquake is commonly\r\ndescribed by the geographic position of its epicenter and by its focal\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes beneath the ocean floor sometimes generate immense sea waves\r\nor tsunamis (Japan’s dread “huge wave”). These waves travel across the\r\nocean at speeds as great as 960 kilometers per hour (597 miles per hour)\r\nand may be 15 meters (49 feet) high or higher by the time they reach the\r\nshore. During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, tsunamis engulfing coastal\r\nareas caused most of the destruction at Kodiak, Cordova, and Seward and\r\ncaused severe damage along the west coast of North America, particularly\r\nat Crescent City, Calif. Some waves raced across the ocean to the coasts\r\nof Japan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tsunami destruction on Kamehameha Avenue on Hilo’s\r\nwaterfront, 1946._ (Photograph provided by the U.S. Army Corps of\r\nEngineers.)]\r\n\r\n_Liquefaction_, which happens when loosely packed, water-logged\r\nsediments lose their strength in response to strong shaking, causes\r\nmajor damage during earthquakes. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,\r\nliquefaction of the soils and debris used to fill in a lagoon caused\r\nmajor subsidence, fracturing, and horizontal sliding of the ground\r\nsurface in the Marina district in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Liquefaction of sands and debris caused major damage\r\nthroughout the Marina district in San Francisco during the Loma Prieta\r\nearthquake._]\r\n\r\nLandslides triggered by earthquakes often cause more destruction than\r\nthe earthquakes themselves. During the 1964 Alaska quake, shock-induced\r\nlandslides devastated the Turnagain Heights residential development and\r\nmany downtown areas in Anchorage. An observer gave a vivid report of the\r\nbreakup of the unstable earth materials in the Turnagain Heights region:\r\n_I got out of my car, ran northward toward my driveway, and then saw\r\nthat the bluff had broken back approximately 300 feet southward from its\r\noriginal edge. Additional slumping of the bluff caused me to return to\r\nmy car and back southward approximately 180 feet to the corner of\r\nMcCollie and Turnagain Parkway. The bluff slowly broke until the corner\r\nof Turnagain Parkway and McCollie had slumped northward._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Many homes were damaged by landslides triggered by the\r\n1964 Alaska earthquake (above) and the 1989 Loma Prieta shock (below)._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home damaged by landslide triggered by the 1989 Loma\r\nPrieta shock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scientist examining seismographic equipment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Measuring Earthquakes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vibrations produced by earthquakes are detected, recorded, and\r\nmeasured by instruments called seismographs. The zig-zag line made by a\r\nseismograph, called a “seismogram,” reflects the changing intensity of\r\nthe vibrations by responding to the motion of the ground surface beneath\r\nthe instrument. From the data expressed in seismograms, scientists can\r\ndetermine the time, the epicenter, the focal depth, and the type of\r\nfaulting of an earthquake and can estimate how much energy was released.\r\n\r\nThe two general types of vibrations produced by earthquakes are _surface\r\nwaves_, which travel along the Earth’s surface, and _body waves_, which\r\ntravel through the Earth. Surface waves usually have the strongest\r\nvibrations and probably cause most of the damage done by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nBody waves are of two types, _compressional_ and _shear_. Both types\r\npass through the Earth’s interior from the focus of an earthquake to\r\ndistant points on the surface, but only compressional waves travel\r\nthrough the Earth’s molten core. Because compressional waves travel at\r\ngreat speeds and ordinarily reach the surface first, they are often\r\ncalled “primary waves” or simply “P” waves. P waves push tiny particles\r\nof Earth material directly ahead of them or displace the particles\r\ndirectly behind their line of travel.\r\n\r\nShear waves do not travel as rapidly through the Earth’s crust and\r\nmantle as do compressional waves, and because they ordinarily reach the\r\nsurface later they are called “secondary” or “S” waves. Instead of\r\naffecting material directly behind or ahead of their line of travel,\r\nshear waves displace material at right angles to their path and are\r\ntherefore sometimes called “transverse” waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of propagation of seismic waves.]\r\n\r\nThe first indication of an earthquake is often a sharp thud, signaling\r\nthe arrival of compressional waves. This is followed by the shear waves\r\nand then the “ground roll” caused by the surface waves. A geologist who\r\nwas at Valdez, Alaska, during the 1964 earthquake described this\r\nsequence: _The first tremors were hard enough to stop a moving person,\r\nand shock waves were immediately noticeable on the surface of the\r\nground. These shock waves continued with a rather long frequency, which\r\ngave the observer an impression of a rolling feeling rather than abrupt\r\nhard jolts. After about 1 minute the amplitude or strength of the shock\r\nwaves increased in intensity and failures in buildings as well as the\r\nfrozen ground surface began to occur.... After about 3½ minutes the\r\nsevere shock waves ended and people began to react as could be\r\nexpected._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Large earthquakes cause more damage east of the Rocky\r\nMountains; this map shows areas that suffered major architectural damage\r\n(striped areas) and minor damage (dotted areas) during the magnitude-8\r\nearthquakes in New Madrid and San Francisco and the smaller but still\r\ndamaging quakes in Charleston and San Fernando._]\r\n\r\nThe severity of an earthquake can be expressed in several ways. The\r\n_magnitude_ of an earthquake, usually expressed by the _Richter Scale_,\r\nis a measure of the amplitude of the seismic waves. The _moment\r\nmagnitude_ of an earthquake is a measure of the amount of energy\r\nreleased—an amount that can be estimated from seismograph recordings.\r\nThe _intensity_, as expressed by the _Modified Mercalli Scale_, is a\r\nsubjective measure that describes how strong a shock was felt at a\r\nparticular location.\r\n\r\nThe Richter Scale, named after Dr. Charles F. Richter of the California\r\nInstitute of Technology, is the best known scale for measuring the\r\nmagnitude of earthquakes. The scale is logarithmic so that a recording\r\nof 7, for example, indicates a disturbance with ground motion 10 times\r\nas large as a recording of 6. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest\r\nquake normally felt by people. Earthquakes with a Richter value of 6 or\r\nmore are commonly considered major; great earthquakes have magnitudes of\r\n8 or more on the Richter scale.\r\n\r\nThe Modified Mercalli Scale expresses the intensity of an earthquake’s\r\neffects in a given locality in values ranging from I to XII. The most\r\ncommonly used adaptation covers the range of intensity from the\r\ncondition of “I—Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable\r\nconditions,” to “XII—Damage total. Lines of sight and level are\r\ndistorted. Objects thrown upward into the air.” Evaluation of earthquake\r\nintensity can be made only after eyewitness reports and results of field\r\ninvestigations are studied and interpreted. The maximum intensity\r\nexperienced in the Alaska earthquake of 1964 was X; damage from the San\r\nFrancisco and New Madrid earthquakes reached a maximum intensity of XI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The January 17, 1994, earthquake at Northridge,\r\nCalifornia, caused this collapse of a major highway interchange._\r\n(Photograph by James W. Dewey, USGS.)]\r\n\r\nEarthquakes of large magnitude do not necessarily cause the most intense\r\nsurface effects. The effect in a given region depends to a large degree\r\non local surface and subsurface geologic conditions. An area underlain\r\nby unstable ground (sand, clay, or other unconsolidated materials), for\r\nexample, is likely to experience much more noticeable effects than an\r\narea equally distant from an earthquake’s epicenter but underlain by\r\nfirm ground such as granite. In general, earthquakes east of the Rocky\r\nMountains affect a much larger area than earthquakes west of the\r\nRockies.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake’s destructiveness depends on many factors. In addition to\r\nmagnitude and the local geologic conditions, these factors include the\r\nfocal depth, the distance from the epicenter, and the design of\r\nbuildings and other structures. The extent of damage also depends on the\r\ndensity of population and construction in the area shaken by the quake.\r\n\r\nThe Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 demonstrated a wide range of effects.\r\nThe Santa Cruz mountains suffered little damage from the seismic waves,\r\neven though they were close to the epicenter. The central core of the\r\ncity of Santa Cruz, about 24 kilometers (15 miles) away from the\r\nepicenter, was almost completely destroyed. More than 80 kilometers (50\r\nmiles) away, the cities of San Francisco and Oakland suffered selective\r\nbut severe damage, including the loss of more than 40 lives. The\r\ngreatest destruction occurred in areas where roads and elevated\r\nstructures were built on unstable ground underlain by loose,\r\nunconsolidated soils.\r\n\r\nThe Northridge, California, earthquake of 1994 also produced a wide\r\nvariety of effects, even over distances of just a few hundred meters.\r\nSome buildings collapsed, while adjacent buildings of similar age and\r\nconstruction remained standing. Similarly, some highway spans collapsed,\r\nwhile others nearby did not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A sudden increase in earthquake tremors signaled the\r\nbeginning of a series of eruptions at Redoubt Volcano in 1989-90._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Volcanoes and Earthquakes\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are associated with volcanic eruptions. Abrupt increases in\r\nearthquake activity heralded eruptions at Mount St. Helens, Washington;\r\nMount Spurr and Redoubt Volcano, Alaska; and Kilauea and Mauna Loa,\r\nHawaii. The location and movement of swarms of tremors indicate the\r\nmovement of magma through the volcano. Continuous records of seismic and\r\ntiltmeter (a device that measures ground tilting) data are maintained at\r\nU.S. Geological Survey volcano observatories in Hawaii, Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, and the Cascades, where study of these records enables\r\nspecialists to make short-range predictions of volcanic eruptions. These\r\nwarnings have been especially effective in Alaska, where the imminent\r\neruption of a volcano requires the rerouting of international air\r\ntraffic to enable airplanes to avoid volcanic clouds. Since 1982, at\r\nleast seven jumbo jets, carrying more than 1,500 passengers, have lost\r\npower in the air after flying into clouds of volcanic ash. Though all\r\nflights were able to restart their engines eventually and no lives were\r\nlost, the aircraft suffered damages of tens of millions of dollars. As a\r\nresult of these close calls, an international team of volcanologists,\r\nmeteorologists, dispatchers, pilots, and controllers have begun to work\r\ntogether to alert each other to imminent volcanic eruptions and to\r\ndetect and track volcanic ash clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Predicting Earthquakes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of earthquake prediction is to give warning of potentially\r\ndamaging earthquakes early enough to allow appropriate response to the\r\ndisaster, enabling people to minimize loss of life and property. The\r\nU.S. Geological Survey conducts and supports research on the likelihood\r\nof future earthquakes. This research includes field, laboratory, and\r\ntheoretical investigations of earthquake mechanisms and fault zones. A\r\nprimary goal of earthquake research is to increase the reliability of\r\nearthquake probability estimates. Ultimately, scientists would like to\r\nbe able to specify a high probability for a specific earthquake on a\r\nparticular fault within a particular year. Scientists estimate\r\nearthquake probabilities in two ways: by studying the history of large\r\nearthquakes in a specific area and the rate at which strain accumulates\r\nin the rock.\r\n\r\nScientists study the past frequency of large earthquakes in order to\r\ndetermine the future likelihood of similar large shocks. For example, if\r\na region has experienced four magnitude 7 or larger earthquakes during\r\n200 years of recorded history, and if these shocks occurred randomly in\r\ntime, then scientists would assign a 50 percent probability (that is,\r\njust as likely to happen as not to happen) to the occurrence of another\r\nmagnitude 7 or larger quake in the region during the next 50 years.\r\n\r\nBut in many places, the assumption of random occurrence with time may\r\nnot be true, because when the strain is released along one part of the\r\nfault system, it may actually increase on another part. Four magnitude\r\n6.8 or larger earthquakes and many magnitude 6-6.5 shocks occurred in\r\nthe San Francisco Bay region during the 75 years between 1836 and 1911.\r\nFor the next 68 years (until 1979), no earthquakes of magnitude 6 or\r\nlarger occurred in the region. Beginning with a magnitude 6.0 shock in\r\n1979, the earthquake activity in the region increased dramatically;\r\nbetween 1979 and 1989, there were four magnitude 6 or greater\r\nearthquakes, including the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake. This\r\nclustering of earthquakes leads scientists to estimate that the\r\nprobability of a magnitude 6.8 or larger earthquake occurring during the\r\nnext 30 years in the San Francisco Bay region is about 67 percent (twice\r\nas likely as not).\r\n\r\nAnother way to estimate the likelihood of future earthquakes is to study\r\nhow fast strain accumulates. When plate movements build the strain in\r\nrocks to a critical level, like pulling a rubber band too tight, the\r\nrocks will suddenly break and slip to a new position. Scientists measure\r\nhow much strain accumulates along a fault segment each year, how much\r\ntime has passed since the last earthquake along the segment, and how\r\nmuch strain was released in the last earthquake. This information is\r\nthen used to calculate the time required for the accumulating strain to\r\nbuild to the level that results in an earthquake. This simple model is\r\ncomplicated by the fact that such detailed information about faults is\r\nrare. In the United States, only the San Andreas fault system has\r\nadequate records for using this prediction method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Using a two-color laser to detect movement along a fault\r\nnear Parkfield, California._]\r\n\r\nBoth of these methods, and a wide array of monitoring techniques, are\r\nbeing tested along part of the San Andreas fault. For the past 150\r\nyears, earthquakes of about magnitude 6 have occurred an average of\r\nevery 22 years on the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, California. The\r\nlast shock was in 1966. Because of the consistency and similarity of\r\nthese earthquakes, scientists have started an experiment to “capture”\r\nthe next Parkfield earthquake. A dense web of monitoring instruments was\r\ndeployed in the region during the late 1980s. The main goals of the\r\nongoing Parkfield Earthquake Prediction Experiment are to record the\r\ngeophysical signals before and after the expected earthquake; to issue a\r\nshort-term prediction; and to develop effective methods of communication\r\nbetween earthquake scientists and community officials responsible for\r\ndisaster response and mitigation. This project has already made\r\nimportant contributions to both earth science and public policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _San Andreas fault in the Carrizo Plain, central\r\nCalifornia._]\r\n\r\nScientific understanding of earthquakes is of vital importance to the\r\nNation. As the population increases, expanding urban development and\r\nconstruction works encroach upon areas susceptible to earthquakes. With\r\na greater understanding of the causes and effects of earthquakes, we may\r\nbe able to reduce damage and loss of life from this destructive\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A statue of Christ at Cemetery Hill overlooks the ruined\r\ntown of Yungay, Peru.
