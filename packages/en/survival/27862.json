With most of our gardeners, however,\r\nit is still considered a very uncertain and unprofitable crop. This is\r\ndue not only to the peculiar requirements of the cauliflower as to soil\r\nand climate, but also to the want of familiarity on the part of most\r\nAmerican gardeners with modern varieties and with methods of cultivation\r\nadapted to our climate.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, while engaged in market gardening and fruit\r\ngrowing in Western Michigan, the writer made a specialty of raising\r\ncauliflowers for the Grand Rapids and Chicago markets, planting from\r\nthree to five acres a year. During this time most of the varieties\r\noffered by American seedsmen were tested, and the best methods of\r\ncultivation sought. On the whole, the cauliflower crop was found more\r\nprofitable than any other, with the possible exception of peaches. There\r\nwere partial failures, but these were due to causes which might have\r\nbeen foreseen and prevented. The experience gained at that time, and\r\nsubsequent observation, have convinced the author that there are many\r\nparts of the country in which the climate and soil are adapted to this\r\nvegetable, but where its cultivation is yet practically unknown. The\r\nrequirements for success with cauliflower will be found to be simple but\r\nimperative. A few direct experiments may be needed after one has gained\r\nthe general information herein set forth, to enable one to determine\r\nwhether it is best to continue or abandon its cultivation in his own\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to treat the subject in a manner adapted to the\r\ndiversity of conditions found within the limits of the United States.\r\nWith no vegetable is it more important to have fixed rules for one's\r\nguidance than with the cauliflower; but these rules must of necessity be\r\nof the most restricted application; in fact, they require to be adjusted\r\nto almost each individual case. So, while I have not omitted to give\r\nminute, practical directions where they seemed necessary, I have\r\nendeavored to call attention to the circumstances under which they are\r\nto be employed, and must here caution the grower against following them\r\ntoo implicitly under different circumstances. This remark applies\r\nparticularly to the selection of varieties and the dates of planting.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Management of the Crop\" will be found the most\r\nimportant information of general application, while in the chapter on\r\n\"Cauliflower Regions\" are given numerous records of experience from\r\ngrowers in all parts of the country, which will be found of special\r\nvalue for each locality.\r\n\r\nThose who desire direct information on particular points will consult\r\nthe index and turn at once to the paragraphs which treat of soil,\r\nculture, enemies, marketing, best varieties, etc. It is unfortunate that\r\nconfusion exists in regard to some of the varieties, but it seemed best\r\nto make the list as complete as possible, even at the risk of\r\nintroducing a few errors. The confusion (which is more apparent than\r\nreal), arises, in part, from seeds of certain varieties having been sold\r\nat times for those of others, and in part from the extreme liability of\r\nthe varieties of the cauliflower to deteriorate or change. Errors from\r\nboth these sources, when reduced to a minimum by the accumulation of\r\nevidence, reveal the fact that there are varieties and groups of\r\nvarieties which have acquired well defined characters, and that the\r\ndifferences between the varieties are increasing rather than otherwise\r\nas time goes on. The selection of varieties for planting is a matter to\r\nbe determined largely by the locality where they are to be grown. The\r\ndifferences between them lie mainly in their adaptation to particular\r\npurposes. There are almost none but what are good somewhere.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit to emphasize here the fact that the fall crop should be\r\nmainly relied upon in this country. It is a waste of time to attempt to\r\nhave cauliflowers head in our hot summer months, and until our markets\r\nare better supplied than they now are with this vegetable, it will not\r\noften pay to do much with the spring crop. The time may come when, as in\r\nEngland, we may expect to have cauliflower and broccoli the year round,\r\nbut it has not come yet.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on cooking cauliflower should not be overlooked. One reason\r\nwhy there is such a limited demand for this vegetable in this country is\r\nthat so few here know how to cook it. The methods of cooking it are\r\nsimple enough, but there are many persons who always hesitate to try\r\nanything new, and as cauliflowers do not appear regularly in the market\r\nthese people never learn how to use them.\r\n\r\nThose interested in extending the market for this vegetable will do well\r\nto devise special means for introducing it into families not familiar\r\nwith it. The writer found that foreigners who had been accustomed to the\r\nuse of cauliflower in the \"Old Country\" were his best customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAULIFLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the sea-coasts of Great Britain and other countries of western\r\nEurope, from Norway around to the northern shores of the Mediterranean\r\n(where it is chiefly at home) grows a small biennial plant, looking\r\nsomewhat like a mustard or half-grown cabbage. This is the wild cabbage,\r\n_Brassica oleracea_, from which our cultivated cabbages originated. It\r\nis entirely destitute of a head, but has rather succulent stems and\r\nleaves, and has been used more or less for food from the earliest\r\nhistoric times. The cultivated plants which most resemble this wild\r\nspecies, are our different sorts of kale. In fact this wild plant is the\r\noriginal, not only of our headed cabbage in its different varieties, but\r\nalso of all forms of kale, the kohl-rabi, brussels-sprouts, broccolis\r\nand cauliflowers. No more wonderful example than this exists of the\r\nchanges produced in a wild plant by cultivation. Just when the\r\nimprovement of the wild cabbage began is unknown, probably at least 4000\r\nyears ago. Of the cultivated forms of this species Theophrastus\r\ndistinguished three, Pliny, six; Tournefort, twenty; and De Candolle, in\r\n1821, more than thirty. For a long time this plant was used for food in\r\na slightly improved state before heads of any kind were developed.\r\nSturtevant, quotes Oliver de Serres, as saying that, \"White cabbages\r\ncame from the north, and the art of making them head was unknown in the\r\ntime of Charlemagne.\" He adds that the first unmistakable reference to\r\nour headed cabbage that he finds is by Rullius, who in 1536 mentions\r\nglobular heads, a foot and a half in diameter. It was probably about\r\nthis time that the cauliflower, and several other forms of the species\r\nmade their appearance. There is difference of opinion as to whether our\r\ncauliflowers or the broccolis were first to originate. London believed\r\nthat the broccolis, which Miller says first came to England from Italy\r\nin 1719, were derived from the cauliflower. Phillips, in his \"History of\r\nCultivated Vegetables,\" said, in 1822, that the broccoli appears to be\r\nan accidental mixture of the common cabbage and the cauliflower, but of\r\nthis he gives no proof.\r\n\r\nSturtevant says: \"It is certainly very curious that the early botanists\r\ndid not describe or figure the broccoli. The omission is only\r\nexplainable on the supposition that it was confounded with the\r\ncauliflower, just as Linnæus brought the cauliflower and the broccoli\r\ninto one botanical variety.\" When broccolis came to England from Italy,\r\nthey were at first known under the names \"sprout-cauliflower,\" or\r\n\"Italian asparagus.\" This, however, is not sufficient reason for\r\nbelieving that the broccolis are derived from the cauliflowers, as the\r\nword broccoli was, and still is, applied in Italy to the tender shoots\r\nof various kinds of cabbages and turnips.\r\n\r\nSome recent authorities have believed, since the broccoli is coarser\r\nthan the cauliflower, more variable in character, more robust in habit,\r\nand requires a longer season, that it is the original form, of which the\r\ncauliflower is only an improvement. Thus, Vilmorin says: \"The sprouting\r\nor asparagus broccoli represents the first form exhibited by the new\r\nvegetable when it ceased to be the earliest cabbage, and was grown with\r\nan especial view to its shoots; after this, by continued selection and\r\nsuccessive improvements, varieties were obtained which produced a\r\ncompact white head, and some of these varieties were still further\r\nimproved into kinds which are sufficiently early to commence and\r\ncomplete their entire growth in the course of the same year; these last\r\nnamed kinds are now known by the name of cauliflowers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cirencester Agricultural College, England, about 1860, broccolis\r\nwere produced, with other variables, directly from seeds of the wild\r\ncabbage. These, and other considerations, make it seem doubtful that our\r\nbroccolis have originated from our cauliflowers. Whatever the original\r\nform of the cauliflower may have been, it seems more probable that the\r\nbroccolis now grown had a separate origin, either from the wild state or\r\nfrom some form of kale. Nearly all our present varieties of broccoli\r\noriginated in England from a few sorts introduced from Italy.\r\n\r\nCauliflowers, in name at least, are older than the broccolis, and were\r\nbrought to a high state of development and widely distributed before the\r\nlatter are mentioned in history. They were grown in the Mediterranean\r\nregion long before they became known in other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nSturtevant finds no mention of the cauliflower or broccoli in ancient\r\nauthors, the only indication of the kind being the use of the word\r\n_cyma_ by Pliny for a form of the cabbage tribe, which he thinks may\r\nhave been the broccoli. Heuze states that three varieties of cauliflower\r\nwere known in Spain in the twelfth century. In 1565 the cauliflower is\r\nreported as being extensively grown in Hayti in the New World.\r\n\r\nIn 1573-5, Rauwolf, while traveling in the East, found the cauliflower\r\ncultivated at Aleppo, in Turkey. It seems to have been introduced into\r\nEngland from the Island of Cyprus, and it is mentioned by Lyte, in 1586,\r\nunder the name of \"Cyprus coleworts.\"\r\n\r\nAlpinus, in his work on the \"Plants of Egypt,\" published in 1591, states\r\nthat the only plants of the cabbage tribe which he saw in that country\r\nwere the cauliflower and kohl-rabi. Cauliflower was also well known in\r\nGreece at an early day.\r\n\r\nGerard published a figure of it in England in 1597. In 1612 it is\r\nreported as being cultivated in France, and in 1619 as being sold in the\r\nLondon market. In 1694 Pompes, a French author, is quoted as saying\r\nthat, \"It comes to us in Paris by way of Marseilles from the Isle of\r\nCyprus, which is the only place I know of where it seeds.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, its cultivation gradually extended throughout Europe.\r\nIn England, especially, the cauliflower, as well as the broccoli, became\r\na popular garden vegetable. Philip Miller, in his \"Gardener's\r\nDictionary,\" published in 1741, gives a long description of the method\r\nof growing this vegetable, though mentioning but one variety, while\r\nseveral varieties of broccoli are described. He says, however, that\r\n\"cauliflowers have of late years been so far improved in England as to\r\nfar exceed in goodness and magnitude what are produced in most parts of\r\nEurope.\" Prior to the French Revolution, (which began in 1778)\r\ncauliflower had, in fact, come to be largely exported from England into\r\nHolland, Germany and France; but soon after this it came to be more\r\ngenerally grown in those countries and was no longer imported, though\r\nEnglish seed was still used.\r\n\r\nThe numerous varieties of cauliflower now cultivated are of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. Although some of the earliest writers on\r\nthis vegetable mention two or more varieties, these were in some cases\r\nmerely different crops produced by sowing the seed at different periods.\r\nIn 1796, Marshall, in his English work on gardening, says that\r\n\"cauliflower is sometimes distinguished into an early and late sort;\r\nthough in fact there is no difference, only as the seed of that called\r\n'early' is saved from the foremost plants.\" Phillips, in 1822, said:\r\n\"Our gardeners furnish us with an early and a late variety, both of\r\nwhich are much esteemed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Don, of England, in his work on botany and gardening (\"History\r\nof Dichlamydeous Plants\") describes fifteen varieties of broccoli and\r\nthree of cauliflower. The latter were known as Early, Later or Large,\r\nand Red, the last being the most hardy. These three kinds differed but\r\nlittle in general character, and were all inclined to sport into\r\ninferior varieties.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 there was still a discussion in England as to whether the early\r\nand late cauliflowers were really distinct, or differed only in time of\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\nJohn Rogers, in his \"Vegetable Cultivator\" (London, 1843), said: \"There\r\nare two varieties of the cauliflower, the early and the late, which are\r\nalike in their growth and size, only that the early kind, as the name\r\nimplies, comes in about a week before the other, provided the true sort\r\nhas been obtained. There is, however, no certainty of knowing this,\r\nunless by sowing the seed from the earliest sorts, as is the practice of\r\nthe London kitchen gardeners. The early variety was grown for a number\r\nof years in the grounds called the Meat-house Gardens, at Millbank, near\r\nChelsea, and was of a superior quality, and generally the first at\r\nmarket. The late variety is supposed to have originated from a stock for\r\nmany years cultivated on a piece of ground called the Jamaica level,\r\nnear Deptford, and which produced uncommonly fine heads, but later than\r\nthose at Millbank. Both soils are nearly similar, being a deep rich\r\nloam, on a moist subsoil, and continually enriched with dung. Both the\r\nvarieties are of a delicate nature, being generally too tender to resist\r\nthe cold of the winter season without the occasional aid of glasses or\r\nother means; and the sight of many acres overspread with such glasses in\r\nthe vicinity of London gives a stranger a forcible idea of the riches\r\nand luxury of the capital.\"\r\n\r\nIn France, in 1824, three varieties, differing mainly in earliness, were\r\nrecognized, _le dur_, _le_ _demi-dur_ and _le tendre_. These names are\r\nstill applied to well known French sorts.\r\n\r\nVictor Paquet, in his _Plantes Potagers_, published at Paris in 1846,\r\nsays: \"The greater number of varieties of cauliflower are white, but\r\nsome are green or reddish. They are cooked in water, and dressed with\r\noil or white sauce. We cultivate two distinct varieties, _tendre_ and\r\n_demi-dur_. The sub-varieties _gros_ and _petit Solomon_ are sorts of\r\nthe _tendre_.\"\r\n\r\nThus we see that early in the present century there were sorts differing\r\nat least in time of maturity which had originated by selection; and,\r\nalthough history does not show it, we must infer that even then there\r\nwere distinct differences in the cauliflowers cultivated in different\r\nparts of Europe. From this time on cauliflowers from various localities\r\nwere brought more into public notice and greater efforts were made\r\ntoward their improvement.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, C. M. Hovey, of Boston, said, that \"the varieties of\r\ncauliflower have been greatly improved within a few years, and now not\r\nless than a dozen kinds are found in the catalogues.\" The most noted of\r\nthose mentioned by him are Walcheren and Large Asiatic--varieties still\r\nin cultivation. Burr described ten sorts in 1863, and Vilmorin sixteen\r\nsorts in 1883. There are recorded in the present work the names of one\r\nhundred and forty varieties besides synonyms. Some of these varieties\r\nare no longer cultivated, and a few are too near other sorts to be\r\nconsidered worthy of a separate name; so that of the cauliflowers proper\r\nthere may be said to be now in cultivation about one hundred distinct\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CAULIFLOWER INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as already stated, the cauliflower industry is but\r\nlittle developed. This vegetable receives, for example, far less\r\nattention than is given to celery, though it is more easily grown. One\r\nmay look over the recent files of some of our agricultural and\r\nhorticultural papers for several years together and not find the\r\ncauliflower mentioned. In fact, more general attention was given the\r\ncauliflower in this country forty years ago than to-day. The\r\ndisappointments of those who attempted to grow cauliflower at an early\r\nday, expecting to grow it, as in Europe, with as little trouble as\r\ncabbage, have led to an almost universal belief that the cauliflower is\r\npeculiarly unreliable in the United States. This, for a large portion of\r\nthe country, is true; but it is beginning to be known that there are\r\nlocalities where, with proper management, it is almost as safe as any\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means true that in Europe the cauliflower is everywhere\r\ngrown with success. There are comparatively small areas, even in the\r\nmost favorable portions of that continent, where it can be profitably\r\ngrown. Although the climate of Europe, as a whole, is better for this\r\nvegetable than that of the United States, the greater success with the\r\ncauliflower there is due largely to the greater care exercised in\r\nchoosing proper soil, in fertilization, and in irrigation. The area of\r\ncauliflower growing has largely increased in Europe within the past few\r\nyears. In the vicinity of Angiers, France, the growing of cauliflower\r\nfor market began about 1880. In a short time it reached an extent of\r\nseveral thousand hectares (a hectare is two and one-half acres). There\r\nis found in this region a loamy soil, such as is especially suitable for\r\nthis vegetable. The land is thrown up into beds twenty-five or thirty\r\nfeet wide, with ditches between for irrigation. The rows are placed two\r\nand one-half feet apart, and the plants one and one-half feet apart in\r\nthe rows. On the approach of winter the plants which are still unheaded\r\nare ridged up with earth for protection in the same manner as celery.\r\nThe crop fails from too cold or too wet weather, about one year in five.\r\nThe heads are mostly sent to Paris, and sell there at from forty cents\r\nto $1 per dozen. Even at these rates the crop is a profitable one, often\r\nbringing $300 per acre after paying the cost of marketing. Land is worth\r\nfrom $24 to $40 per acre. For three or four weeks in spring there are\r\nsent from Angiers to Paris, on an average, forty car-loads per day. In\r\nthe immediate vicinity of Paris large quantities of cauliflower are\r\ngrown for market.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Germany the cauliflower is a very popular crop. Around\r\nErfurt, which is nearly in the center of the empire, greater care is\r\ntaken with its cultivation than probably anywhere else in the world, and\r\nlarge quantities are grown for seed. The late James Vick has told\r\n(Report Mich. Pom. Soc., 1874, p. 206,) how the low swampy land around\r\nErfurt is thrown up into wide beds with ditches between, from which,\r\nevery dry day, the water is dipped upon the plants. In Austria, also,\r\ncauliflower is a well-known vegetable, and several valuable varieties\r\nhave originated in that country. Few seedsmen offer a more complete list\r\nof varieties than those of Vienna. In Italy the cauliflower has long\r\nbeen known, and in some places is a staple food of the poorer classes.\r\nMost of our standard late varieties are of Italian origin.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, cauliflowers are grown not only for home use and for seed,\r\nbut also for the early London market. Around London the cauliflower has\r\nbeen extensively grown for a longer time than anywhere else, and it is\r\nthere regarded as one of the most important garden crops. A recent\r\nEnglish writer says: \"With the exception of the potato, I question\r\nwhether there is another vegetable to be compared with the cauliflower\r\nfor general usefulness.\" Hundreds of acres are devoted to it near\r\nLondon, a large portion being under glass for the early crop. Formerly\r\nthe cauliflower crop was all cut and sent to market, with the exception\r\nof a small portion saved for seed; but of late, extensive fields are\r\npurchased entire by Crosse and Blackwell for pickling purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are a few points where the growing of\r\ncauliflower for market is assuming considerable importance. On Long\r\nIsland, in 1879, the crop was estimated by Oemler at 100,000 pounds,\r\nbesides what was used for pickling. In 1885 Brill estimated the total\r\ncrop of Suffolk County at about 125,000 barrels. In 1889, the value of\r\nthe crop sold from Suffolk County was estimated at $200,000, nine-tenths\r\nof all the cauliflowers sent to the New York market being grown in that\r\ncounty. At Farmingdale and Central Park, in 1888, two pickle factories\r\nused five hundred barrels of cauliflowers, besides the usual proportion\r\nof other vegetables. Much of the crop from Long Island is now sent to\r\nmarkets beyond New York. Philadelphia receives but little good\r\ncauliflower except that which comes from Long Island. The same is true\r\nof the city of Washington. The receipts in the latter city from Long\r\nIsland for the three fall months of 1890 were about 20,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago market is seldom fully supplied with cauliflowers and the\r\nprice there averages fully as good as anywhere in the country.\r\nConsiderable amounts are grown near the city, and small quantities are\r\nshipped in from Michigan, Wisconsin, Central Illinois, and even from\r\nCalifornia. One pickle factory at Crystal Lake, near Chicago,\r\ncontracted, in 1874, for 16 acres of cauliflowers, besides other\r\nproduce. The pickle factories always furnish a market for any surplus\r\nwhen the price is low, or the heads have become disfigured in any way.\r\nIn fact, the supply of home grown cauliflowers is always insufficient\r\nfor pickling purposes, and large amounts have to be annually imported,\r\nnotwithstanding the tariff, which, formerly ten per cent., ad valorum,\r\nis now forty-five per cent. Imported cauliflowers are brought mainly\r\nfrom Germany and Holland, and come packed in brine in 60 gallon casks.\r\nLarge quantities of mixed pickles containing cauliflower are also\r\nimported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF THE CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\nAlmost any soil will do for the cauliflower, providing it is moist and\r\nfertile. The requirements of this vegetable as to soil are practically\r\nthe same as those for the cabbage, except, that as the cauliflower will\r\nstand less drouth, it should generally have a heavier and richer soil,\r\nand rather more room. A soil which produces cabbages with large and\r\nrather soft heads is likely to be good for cauliflowers; that is, it\r\ncontains more vegetable matter than the right amount for producing hard\r\nheads of cabbage. Muck will answer for cauliflowers if it is not too wet\r\nor too dry; it should like any other soil be treated to a good coat of\r\nbarn-yard manure--horse manure being preferable on such land, as it\r\npromotes fermentation. Small quantities of lime may also be applied for\r\nthe same reason.\r\n\r\nThe best soil is generally a strong sandy loam. Light sand or gravel is\r\nthe poorest; and unless made very rich and artificially watered, it is\r\nuseless to attempt to grow cauliflowers on such a soil in ordinary\r\nseasons. Heavy clay is less suitable for cauliflower than for cabbage,\r\nchiefly because on such a soil the plants are apt to be small and late.\r\nIn a warm climate a heavier soil is required than in a cool one. The\r\nground should, if possible, be fresh sod-land (preferably pasture) or at\r\nmost one year removed from the sod. It is unsafe to plant cauliflowers\r\nafter cauliflowers, or any other plant of the cabbage tribe, though it\r\nis sometimes successfully done. Newly cleared land, or land fresh from\r\nthe sod, is even more desirable for cauliflowers than for cabbages. On\r\nnew land the crop is not only less subject to disease and the attacks of\r\ninsects, but its growth is likely to be more satisfactory, even without\r\nmanure, or with only a moderate amount, than it is on old land, however\r\nwell manured.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower is a gross feeder, and land intended for this crop can\r\nhardly be made too rich. Barn-yard manure is usually employed, and there\r\nis nothing better for general use. Commercial fertilizers--potash, soda\r\nand phosphates--are also good, especially to promote heading. The wild\r\nplant from which the cauliflower is derived being a native of the\r\nsea-shore, common salt seems particularly adapted to it. Kelp, or\r\nsea-weed, is used with advantage where it can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIf barn-yard manure is not too coarse, plowing it under in moderate\r\namount will, in addition to its fertilizing effect, help to keep the\r\nland moist. Where the cabbage maggot is troublesome the use of fresh\r\nstable manure is thought to promote the attack of that insect, and\r\ntherefore only well rotted manure is recommended. Of course a larger\r\namount of manure may be safely applied if it is well rotted than if it\r\nis coarse and strawy. Liquid manure is used by many growers, being\r\napplied a few weeks before planting, and from time to time during the\r\nseason. Water-closet contents, diluted or composted, and applied either\r\nin the liquid or powdered form, is one of the best of fertilizers for\r\nthe cauliflower, but it should not be used too freely, or too late in\r\nthe season. All coarse or concentrated fertilizers should be applied at\r\nleast two weeks before the time for transplanting, and such as are\r\napplied on the surface should be well mixed with the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWING THE SEED.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the seed-bed will vary according to circumstances. I\r\nformerly grew the plants for the fall crop in beds elevated two or three\r\nfeet above the ground, in order to escape the flea beetle, but in later\r\nyears I have grown a portion of the plants in the open ground. This\r\nmethod requires less care, and is now usually practiced by large\r\ngrowers, though it sometimes fails, for the reason stated. Remedies for\r\nthe flea beetle will be found in another chapter. The soil in which the\r\nplants are to be grown should be rich and fine, rather light, and\r\nimproved, if necessary, with a little of the finest old rotted manure. A\r\nsmall amount of lime or ashes raked into the soil is a benefit, and is\r\nthought to prevent the attack of the cabbage maggot, though its value,\r\nif any, for this purpose, is slight. An old brush-heap burnt off makes a\r\nfavorite place for sowing cauliflower and cabbage seed, but it is seldom\r\nthat market gardeners care to go out of their way to get such a place.\r\nThe large cauliflower growers of Long Island usually sow the seed in\r\ndrills across one end of the field in which the crop is to be grown,\r\nraking into the soil before sowing, a moderate dressing of some\r\ncommercial fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIt is often recommended to sow the seed on the north side of a fence, or\r\nin some other partially shaded place. I have never seen any necessity\r\nfor this, and once spoiled a quantity of plants by growing them in the\r\npartial shade of some large trees. At the South, as elsewhere stated, it\r\nis sometimes necessary to give the young plants shade during the middle\r\nof the day if they are started in the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe seed should always be sown thinly, not only because it is expensive\r\nand none should be wasted, but in order that all may have room to\r\ndevelop into healthy and stocky plants. If the weather is at all dry it\r\nis well to lay boards, or some other covering, over the seed-bed until\r\nthe plants begin to come up. This will insure speedy and uniform\r\ngermination. If this is done the seed may be sown very shallow;\r\notherwise it should be sown at least half an inch deep (or even deeper\r\nif the soil is light) and the soil pressed firm after sowing.\r\n\r\nTransplanting the young plants in the seed-bed will render them stocky\r\nand vigorous, and should always be practiced with the early crop, but if\r\nthe seed is sown sufficiently thin it is unnecessary with out-door\r\nplants intended for the late crop. Some growers, including Mr. Gregory\r\nof Massachusetts, practice sowing the seed in hills in the open ground\r\nwhere the plants are to remain. Several seeds are placed in a hill to\r\ninsure against loss. This method, however, will seldom be found\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nTo the above may be added the following excellent directions given by\r\nMr. Francis Brill, of Riverhead, Long Island, in his pamphlet on the\r\ncauliflower: \"Occasionally, by reason of drouth, and frequently by\r\nreason of the ravages of insects, great difficulty has been experienced\r\nin growing plants in spring and early summer, which seldom occurs in the\r\nfall--at which time, however, the same precautions may be used. Time was\r\nwhen we could circumvent the flea and louse on young plants by the use\r\nof lime, tobacco, ashes, soot, etc., but of late years they seem to\r\nhave been so very abundant, and so materially aided in their work of\r\ndestruction by the black grub below and the green grub above ground,\r\nthat many complete failures have occurred in endeavors to grow plants.\r\nTo avoid this I recommend that the ground intended for plants be plowed\r\nor spaded in the fall, and if stable manure is to be used, let it be\r\nwell rotted and turned under at this time, and again work the soil early\r\nin the spring, at this time turning under a good dressing of potash\r\nsalts; keep the ground free from weeds by occasional stirring until the\r\ntime for sowing the seed, then lay out a bed six feet wide, and as long\r\nas you please; make the surface smooth, and enclose it with common\r\nboards ten or twelve inches in width set edgewise perpendicularly,\r\none-half their width under ground and held in place by stakes driven at\r\nthe joints and centres. Within this frame, beginning at either end, dig\r\nand thoroughly pulverize the soil by means of a spading fork, potato\r\nfork, or similar implement, watching closely for any grub worms which\r\nmay not have been eradicated by the previous workings and which we now\r\npropose to keep out by means of the partially sunken boards.\r\n\r\n\"Fertilizers may, at this time, be applied and forked under or raked in,\r\nusing judgment as to method and quantity, which must be determined by\r\nthe previous condition of the soil and the strength of the material\r\nused, remembering that it is not well to have any chemicals in too close\r\nproximity to the tender rootlets of the young plants; and while poor\r\nsoil is no place in which to grow healthy plants, yet they should not be\r\nover stimulated, but the ground must be in proper condition to keep up a\r\nvigorous and healthy growth. Let this digging be done in the latter part\r\nof the afternoon when the sun has spent its force and the soil will not\r\ndry out too quickly; rake the bed as you go, and sow the seed while the\r\nsurface soil is fresh and moist, using a ten-inch board as long as your\r\nbed is wide, which place five or six inches from the end or head of the\r\nframe, crosswise, and with a blunt stick, say three-fourths of an inch\r\nin diameter, draw a mark not more than one-half an inch deep along each\r\nedge of the board; sow the seed thinly in these marks, using the thumb\r\nand finger to guide it; then turning the board twice, sow two more rows,\r\nand so proceed until you have sown several rows, say 12 to 20, when they\r\nmust be covered, using the back of a spade, drawing it with some\r\npressure half way from each side of the bed. A very important part of\r\nthis operation which must not be overlooked _is to get the seed in and\r\ncovered while the ground is fresh and damp_; therefore complete the work\r\nin sections. At the distance given the hoe can be used and the soil\r\nstirred between the rows, which is quite essential to a proper growth\r\nof the plants, as well as necessary to keep down the weeds.\r\n\r\n\"The sowing completed, the bed may be covered with old bags or cloth to\r\nretain the moisture, which, however, must be removed upon the first\r\nsigns of the seed germinating; but what is better still, a shade of\r\nmuslin can be used, supported by the upper edges of the frame and narrow\r\nstrips laid across, which can remain until the plants are well above\r\nground, when it should be removed, the plants sprinkled with tobacco\r\ndust, air slacked lime, ashes or common plaster, and a covering of\r\nmosquito netting be substituted for the muslin, which will admit light,\r\nair and sunshine, yet be a partial shade, and will help to protect the\r\nplants from insects. This cover may be removed during rainy weather,\r\nand, if you please, every night to give the plants the benefit of the\r\ndew.\r\n\r\n\"I have decided objections to artificial watering of seed-beds,\r\nespecially when the seed is first sown or in the early stages of growth\r\nof the plants, and this may generally be avoided by following the\r\ndirections just given; but when circumstances may seem to demand\r\notherwise, let the bed be prepared and in the afternoon thoroughly\r\nsaturated, and toward evening the seed may be sown and covered as above\r\ndescribed, but never water the bed after the seed has been sown until\r\nthe plants are well up, for this has a tendency to pack the surface and\r\ncause it to bake and prevent proper germinating of the seed. After the\r\nplants are fairly above ground, light waterings at evening may be given,\r\nbut must be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\n\"I have not given these precautions for sowing seed in September for\r\nwintering over, for the reason that at that season of the year we are\r\ncomparatively free from insects and drouths.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO SOW.\r\n\r\nThe time for sowing will depend of course on the locality and variety.\r\nAt the North, half early varieties, intended for the fall crop, are\r\nusually sown and set out about the same time as late cabbage. In Western\r\nMichigan, in latitude 43°, I have found that Early Paris sown about May\r\n12, and set out about the 20th of June, begins to head in September, and\r\nforms its main crop in October, about the time desired. In the latitude\r\nof New York City the time for setting out the main crop is from June 20\r\nto the 1st of August. Plants set as late as the 1st of August are\r\nintended to head just before winter, and must be of the earliest\r\nvarieties. The large late varieties, like Autumn Giant, if used at all,\r\nmust be started early and set out not later than the first of June, as\r\nthey require the entire season.\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds are often sown to form a succession, but where one has\r\ntested a variety and found it adapted to his needs, it is often quite as\r\nwell to rely upon it almost entirely, and make two or three sowings for\r\na succession if desired. Even a single sowing, well timed, will\r\ngenerally furnish cuttings through the most favorable part of the\r\nseason. If the seed is of the best quality, and the plants are of\r\nuniform size, and all set at the same time, neither too early nor too\r\nlate, on soil of uniform character, they will in a good season form most\r\nof their heads within a short space of time, sometimes within a week;\r\nbut generally in a given sowing, a few heads will form very early, then\r\nthe bulk of the crop will come on during three or four weeks, while the\r\nremainder will hang on until late, perhaps until winter. No other crop\r\nis so much affected in time of maturity by the character of the season\r\nas the cauliflower, and even the most experienced growers sometimes fail\r\nin getting them to head at the time desired.\r\n\r\nThe time for starting the plants for the early crop in the North is in\r\nFebruary, and the method is described in full in another chapter. They\r\nshould be set out, as stated, as soon as heavy freezing is past, say\r\nabout the middle of April. The most unfavorable time of any, and yet the\r\ntime when the inexperienced are most likely to set them, is about the\r\nmiddle of May, for early varieties set then usually head in August when\r\nit is seldom that heads can be obtained of good quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE GROUND.\r\n\r\nLand intended for cauliflowers should be plowed deeply, as the\r\ncauliflower is a deep feeder and delights in a rich, cool subsoil; in\r\nfact, with no other plant of the cabbage family is a deep soil so\r\nimportant. The manure, of whatever kind, should be mainly spread upon\r\nthe ground and plowed under, a smaller amount, in a finely divided\r\nstate, being harrowed in upon the surface. The plowing should be done at\r\nleast a month before the plants are to be set, and the land kept well\r\nharrowed or cultivated until that time in order to retain the moisture\r\nin the soil, and put it in the best condition for the growth of the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING THE PLANTS.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for setting the plants it is a good plan to go over\r\nthe surface with a planker in order to smooth it off, so the marking can\r\nbe nicely done. This also packs the ground somewhat, so that the plants\r\ncan be set more firmly. The land may be then marked out, crosswise\r\nfirst, three feet apart, then lengthwise three feet apart for Dwarf\r\nErfurt and all small growing kinds, and four feet apart for Algiers and\r\nother large varieties. These are suitable distances for the late crop in\r\nordinary cases, but where land is cheap, and little manure used, except\r\nsod turned under, four by four feet is none too much room for the large\r\nvarieties. The early crop, on the other hand, which is always heavily\r\nmanured, is sometimes set with the rows as close as two feet apart, and\r\nthe plants twenty inches apart in the rows. The small size of the heads\r\nresulting from close planting is no actual loss, for small heads, if of\r\ngood quality, are more popular than large ones, and bring a higher price\r\nin proportion to their size. The greatest danger from too close setting\r\nof the main crop is that the plants may fail to head at all. It is for\r\nthis reason that cauliflowers are usually set farther apart than\r\ncabbages.\r\n\r\nThe best time to set the plants is just before or after a rain, but they\r\nmay be set at any time if the soil has been kept damp by frequent\r\ncultivation. In dry, clear weather the planting should be done only\r\ntoward the close of the day. If it should be necessary to apply water at\r\nthe time of setting, it should be thoroughly done, not less than a quart\r\nbeing placed in each hole which is to receive a plant. Water should\r\nnever be applied after the plant is set unless loose earth is afterwards\r\nthrown over the place, for the compact surface left after the water has\r\nbeen absorbed dries out more rapidly than before.\r\n\r\nThe plants to be set should not be too large or they will be liable to\r\nbutton, especially if the conditions are in any way unfavorable for\r\ngrowth. If large plants must be used extra pains should be taken in\r\nsetting, in order that there may be as little check in their growth as\r\npossible. With cauliflowers, as with cabbages, large plants are the\r\neasiest to make live, but, for the reason stated, it is less desirable\r\nto use them.\r\n\r\nSetting the plants in shallow trenches, after the manner of celery, is\r\nsometimes practised in garden culture. This places the roots where the\r\nsoil is cool and moist and enables the plants to be watered to good\r\nadvantage. This method is mainly used in early spring planting, when,\r\nbesides its convenience in irrigation, it also serves to protect the\r\nplants from cold winds. Planting between ridges, as elsewhere described,\r\nserves the same purpose of protection. In either case the surface is\r\ngradually brought to a level as the plants are cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.\r\n\r\nIn cultivation everything depends on keeping up a steady, vigorous\r\ngrowth, for if the plants are checked in their growth, they are liable\r\neither to form small heads prematurely, or to continue their growth so\r\nlate as to fail to head at all. Level cultivation is usually practiced,\r\nthe same as in ordinary field crops. Drawing the earth to the stems, as\r\nsometimes recommended and practiced abroad, is unnecessary, though with\r\ntall growing varieties it serves a useful purpose in preventing the\r\nplants being blown over by the wind. Cultivation should continue until\r\nthe leaves are so large that they are liable to be broken off, or until\r\nthe plants are nearly ready to head. The application of a mulch of\r\nmanure or litter at the time cultivation ceases, is an excellent\r\npractice, though seldom resorted to. It is important that deep\r\ncultivation should cease at the right time, even if the hoe has to be\r\nused afterward. The crop may be seriously injured, or at least delayed,\r\nby cultivation after the plants begin to head. At this time the ground\r\nshould be undisturbed so that the roots may occupy the entire soil. Dry\r\nweather, and the compact nature of the soil after cultivation ceases,\r\ncheck the growth of the plants, and promote the formation of heads,\r\nproviding the plants have attained a proper age and size. The influence\r\nof a firm soil in promoting heading is also seen in the success with\r\nwhich cauliflowers can frequently be grown after peas or other early\r\ncrops. In autumn the first sharp frosts appear to be particularly\r\nefficacious in starting the plants to heading.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nAfter heading has commenced is the time when irrigation is most needed.\r\nAn abundance of water at this time will add greatly, both to the\r\nquantity and quality of the product, particularly if some fertilizer is\r\nadded at the same time. Irrigation is not often practiced in this\r\ncountry, except in the arid districts of the West, and occasionally,\r\nwith the early crop, near a few of our large cities. In Europe, where\r\nlabor is cheap, it is often resorted to, even where the water has to be\r\ncarried by hand. Early in the season, if irrigation is needed, once a\r\nweek is frequent enough to apply the water, but while the plants are\r\nheading it may be applied with advantage every day if the weather is\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLANCHING THE HEADS.\r\n\r\nThe value of cauliflowers for use or market depends almost entirely on\r\ntheir being white and tender. To have them remain in this condition\r\nuntil fully matured, they must be protected from the sun. Heads which\r\nare left exposed become yellow in color, or even brownish purple if the\r\nsun is very hot. Such heads also acquire a strong, disagreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of covering the heads, but it is nearly always\r\ndone with the leaves of the plant. Early in the season, when the weather\r\nis dry and warm, the work may be done during the heat of the day by\r\nlapping the leaves, one after another, over the head until it is\r\nsufficiently covered, tucking the last leaf under to hold all in place.\r\nOr the leaves may be fastened with a butcher's skewer, or any sharp\r\nstick. In Florida, orange thorns are employed for this purpose. Care\r\nmust be taken not to confine the heads too closely, or they will grow\r\nout of shape, besides being liable to heat and become spotted. Later in\r\nthe season, when the weather is cool and damp, the leaves will be too\r\nstiff to be bent down, and the head must then be protected either by\r\nplacing over it leaves broken from the outer part of the plant, or from\r\nstumps from which the heads have already been cut, or by tying the\r\nleaves together above the head. The latter is the usual method, rye\r\nstraw or bast matting being generally used for the purpose. Merely\r\nbreaking down the inner leaves upon the head is unsatisfactory, as the\r\ngrowth, both of the leaves and the head, soon causes the head to become\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe artificial blanching of the head is most important early in the\r\nseason, while the sun is hot, and the field should then be gone over as\r\noften as every other day for this purpose, taking two rows at a time.\r\nLater in the season, during damp, cloudy weather, heads will sometimes\r\nreach full size and still be of good color though entirely exposed. It\r\nis unsafe to leave them in this way, however, as a little change in\r\ncolor seriously affects their market value. Covering the heads appears\r\nalso to cause them to grow larger and remain solid longer than they\r\notherwise would, particularly early in the season.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING FROM FROST.\r\n\r\nAnother object, late in the season, in covering the heads, is to protect\r\nthem from frost. A frosted cauliflower is practically worthless for\r\nmarket, as it is nearly certain to turn black on the surface after one\r\nor two days' exposure. Freezing, in fact, is one of the most frequent\r\nsources of loss on cauliflowers late in the season, and as this is the\r\nmost favorable time of the year for them to head, it is necessary to\r\ntake particular care to guard against loss from this cause. We\r\nfrequently have a few hard frosts early in October, which spoil such\r\nheads as are nearly mature, unless they have been protected. After this\r\nthere may be a month or more of good weather, during which the bulk of\r\nthe crop may come to maturity. The heads are protected from frost in the\r\nsame manner as from the sun, but it is best not to have the leaves lie\r\ndirectly on the head. Protection is particularly needed as the heads\r\napproach maturity, as they are then more easily injured than while\r\nsmall. Heads which are well covered will usually stand eight or ten\r\ndegrees of frost without injury, depending on the amount of cloudiness\r\nand moisture present. In cool, moist, cloudy weather, frosted heads will\r\nsometimes recover and show no injury. It is even possible for heads to\r\nbecome frozen solid and come out in good condition, but this rarely\r\noccurs, and requires that the thawing take place in the most favorable\r\nmanner possible. Cutting the frozen heads with their leaves, throwing\r\nthem in shallow heaps upon the ground, and covering with straw, will\r\nsometimes bring them out in good condition; also throwing them into\r\nwater but little above the freezing point. The safest way, however, if\r\npossible, is to cook the heads at once, putting the frozen heads\r\ndirectly into boiling water. Treated in this manner they exhibit little\r\nor no effect of the freezing.\r\n\r\nThe safest way, in case heavy freezing is apprehended, is to cut and\r\nremove to a place of safety all heads which have attained half their\r\nsize or more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING THE HEADS.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of cutting will depend on the season of the year. In\r\nsummer, the heads will remain at the proper stage for cutting no more\r\nthan a day or two, while late in autumn they may often be left a week\r\nbefore becoming overgrown.\r\n\r\nFrequent cutting is at all times desirable, however, as it is best to\r\nlet the heads get as large as they will before becoming loose and warty.\r\nThe gain in size not only increases their selling price, but the flavor\r\nalso appears to improve as the heads approach maturity. Immature heads,\r\nthough mild and tender, have less flavor than those which are full\r\ngrown. It is better, however, to cut a head too soon than to leave it\r\ntoo long, for a small solid head will sell for more than a large loose\r\none. To judge when a head has reached full size requires some\r\nexperience. The size of course, will depend on that of the plant, but\r\nits size in proportion to that of the plant is perhaps the most common\r\npoint by which one judges when it is ready to cut. The head, when it\r\napproaches maturity, rises within the leaves and bulges the latter\r\noutward, so that one can often tell at some distance which heads are\r\nabout ready. The surface of the head, as it approaches maturity loses\r\nits polished appearance and becomes more distinctly grained. This\r\nchange, if it does not go too far, does not detract from its appearance\r\nand value. To examine a head, do not untie the top, but part the leaves\r\nat the side. If there are signs of cracking or breaking it is ready to\r\ncut. The heads should be cut with about an inch of stalk and two or\r\nthree full circles of leaves. A long thin-bladed knife is best to cut\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe best time of the day in which to cut the heads, if for home use, or\r\na near market, is in the morning while the dew is on, as they will then\r\nremain longer in a fresh state than if cut latter in the day. If to pack\r\nfor a distant market, the heads will carry and keep better if cut when\r\ndry, but on a cool day or toward evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING.\r\n\r\nThe heads must be handled with care to prevent the \"flower\" becoming\r\nbruised or soiled in any way. A bruise will turn black in a short time,\r\nthe same as a frosted surface, and thus injure the sale of the head. The\r\nheads can be handled most safely if the leaves are left on, and these\r\nhad best be left entire until the plants are taken to the packing shed;\r\nand for a near market they may even be left on to advantage until the\r\nplants are ready to be exposed for sale. The main object of their\r\nremoval is in order that the heads may be readily inspected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIMMING.\r\n\r\nThis is often done in the field, but, as just stated, it had better be\r\ndelayed until the heads are carried to the place for packing. To trim\r\nthem, take hold of a head near the butt with one hand, holding it\r\nupright against you, then with a turning motion, cut clear around the\r\nhead, leaving the cut ends of the leaves projecting about an inch above\r\nthe edge of the head. This exposes as much of the head as can be seen at\r\none view, and the leaves as left protect the margin from bruises. The\r\nbutt should be cut off smooth, and there should be left about two layers\r\nof leaves.\r\n\r\nThe heads at the time of packing should be free from moisture, and if\r\nthe leaves are a trifle wilted they will pack all the better. Flour\r\nbarrels, or barrels of that size, are best to pack in, as cauliflowers\r\nare now usually sold at wholesale by the barrel. Barrel-crates of the\r\nsame size are also coming into use, especially for the early crop, as\r\nthe heads are liable to heat in hot weather if packed in close barrels.\r\nEach cauliflower at the time of packing is now usually wrapped in strong\r\nsoft white paper, the edges of the paper being tucked between the leaves\r\nand head. The heads are then placed in the barrels, commencing at the\r\noutside, laying them upon their sides facing in, and filling the center\r\nwith smaller heads. Continue each layer in this way until the barrel is\r\na little more than full. Pack as solid as possible. Cover with canvass\r\nor bagging, putting it under the top hoop and pressing it down by\r\ndriving down and nailing the hoop. Tea-chest matting, which usually\r\ncosts nothing, may be used for covers if desired.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that cauliflowers are sometimes packed in their own\r\nleaves, just as they come from the field, or all the leaves may be\r\nremoved but one or two which are to be folded over the head. It usually\r\npays, however, to use paper, but this must be white, or else when\r\nbruised it will stain the heads.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the cauliflowers are to be sold at retail, sugar-barrels\r\nare used to pack in, as they cost less than other barrels and are\r\nlarger. They are always clean and sweet, and do not make too large a\r\npackage, as cauliflowers are not heavy.\r\n\r\nSmall slatted crates are also a favorite package in which to ship\r\ncauliflowers, particularly early in the season. Large crates, such as\r\nare sometimes used for cabbages, are entirely unsuitable.\r\n\r\nA method of packing cauliflowers for shipment employed in Denmark, is\r\ndescribed as follows: \"The heads are to be cut off in a dry state, but\r\nnot wilted, and with only an inch of stalk. The leaves are to be\r\nremoved, with the exception of a couple of the inner courses, which\r\nshould be cut down to such a length as to meet when they are bent gently\r\ntogether over the head. Pack in clean, open neat-looking crates or\r\nboxes, in the bottom of which put a few leaves, and on these the\r\ncauliflower heads, which should be of a uniform size for each crate.\r\nPack closely and firmly in layers, taking care, however, not to bruise\r\nthe tender heads. All the heads in a layer should turn in the same\r\ndirection, being laid sidewise, and the next layer in the opposite\r\ndirection, respectively, with top and stem. On the top of the heads fill\r\nin with leaves until the cover will press the whole contents so tight as\r\nto prevent the heads from moving during transportation.\"\r\n\r\nThe price of cauliflowers is less subject to fluctuation than that of\r\nmost other vegetables. There is comparatively little competition between\r\ndifferent localities, and about the only causes of low prices are\r\ntemporary and local over-production, and forced sales caused by damaged\r\nstock. One year with another, a dollar and a half a dozen may be\r\nrealized on good heads, which is more than double the average price of\r\ncabbages. Contracts are taken, however, at as low as fifty cents a dozen\r\nto supply pickle-factories. Under favorable conditions fully as large a\r\npercentage of cauliflowers will head as of cabbages, so that in a good\r\nlocation, with proper care, the cauliflower crop is a profitable one. It\r\nmay be well to remind growers, however, that one should not attempt to\r\nsell a large quantity of cauliflowers in a small market, for even at a\r\nlow price people will not buy largely of what they are not accustomed to\r\nusing. But it is surprising to what an extent a market may be developed\r\nfor this vegetable. No one who has once used the cauliflower will\r\nthereafter do without it, if it can be obtained at a reasonable price.\r\nThere is absolutely no necessary limit to the market for this vegetable,\r\nproviding reasonable care is exercised in creating and supplying the\r\ndemand. The price in this country ought always to be maintained if\r\npossible at at least double that of cabbages, not only on account of the\r\ngreater delicacy of the cauliflower, but because of the greater care\r\nneeded in its production, and the uncertainty of the crop, owing to\r\nunfavorable seasons and other causes. I could easily quote examples of\r\nextraordinary profits made in growing the cauliflower, as well as\r\ninstances of repeated failure. Cases of both kinds of experience are\r\ngiven elsewhere in the present volume. I have here only attempted to\r\nshow what may be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING.\r\n\r\nMore attention is being paid of late years to the keeping of\r\ncauliflowers in winter, and it is now customary with some to plant a\r\nsmall late crop for the purpose of winter heading. Most growers,\r\nhowever, will have more or less unheaded plants at the end of nearly\r\nevery season which can be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWilliam Falconer, of Long Island, sows Extra Early Erfurt about July 1,\r\npots the young plants, and sets them in the open field after early\r\npotatoes have come off. In November the plants that show signs of\r\nheading are stripped of the larger outer leaves, then taken up and set\r\nclose together in beds and covered with hot-bed sash. In cold weather\r\nstraw or thatch is added. In this way the plants continue to give heads\r\nuntil February. Plants which have begun to head may be taken up in the\r\nsame way and set in a cellar. Just enough moisture should be given to\r\nkeep them from wilting, as, if too much is given, they are liable to\r\nrot. Fully headed cauliflowers are difficult to keep. If hung up in a\r\ncellar in the way cabbages are frequently kept, they wilt and become\r\nstrong in flavor and dark in color. This may be remedied with a few\r\nheads by cutting off the stem a few inches below the head before they\r\nare hung up, hollowing out the stem and filling the hollow with water.\r\nIt is said that the heads will keep in good condition for a long time if\r\npacked in slightly damp muck. A simple way of preserving partly headed\r\nplants out of doors is to take them up with as much earth as possible\r\nand set them close together in trenches, after the manner of celery,\r\nplacing boards at the sides, and in cold weather a covering of straw\r\noverhead. In this way the heads are easily accessible and keep in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nA method employed in Scotland for preserving cauliflower is to bury them\r\nin a dry place, heads downward and roots exposed, in the ordinary manner\r\nof burying cabbages. They are said to keep well by this method from\r\nNovember to January. The leaves are folded over the heads to keep them\r\nfrom coming in contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nAnother method, employed in Denmark, is to make a bed of moist sand\r\nabout four inches deep in a cool room protected against frost; the floor\r\nhad better be of asphalt, cement or the like. Toward the end of autumn\r\nthe heads are cut with a piece of the stem three or four inches in\r\nlength, which is stuck into the sand. All the leaves are removed except\r\nthe inner course, which must be cut down pretty closely, and the heads\r\nthen covered with flower pots.\r\n\r\nStill another method, employed where hard freezing is not anticipated,\r\nis to take up the plants and set them out in a slanting position close\r\ntogether out of doors with the heads to the north, as is done with\r\ncabbages.\r\n\r\nPulling up the plants and throwing them on their sides will protect the\r\nheads from a moderate degree of cold, and can be resorted to upon the\r\nsudden approach of cold weather. Cutting the heads with plenty of leaves\r\nand throwing them in long low heaps, faces downward, will preserve them\r\nin the cool, damp weather of early winter for a considerable time, and\r\nthe heads, even in this condition, will increase somewhat in size.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes happen, early in the season, that one desires to\r\nretard the development of the head until a convenient time for\r\nmarketing. For this purpose the plants may be lifted, when the heads are\r\nnearly mature, and set under a shed or elsewhere in the shade.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remind those who grow only a few plants in a\r\ngarden, and who wish to prolong the season, that several cuttings may be\r\ntaken from a single head if desired. A portion of the head should be\r\nleft each time. Occasionally, but not often, a stump will sprout and\r\nform a second crop. A method of accelerating the formation of heads,\r\nwhich is practiced in Ireland, may also be worth recording. It consists\r\nin slitting the stalk from near the ground upward toward the heart, and\r\nplacing a stick in the slit to prevent the parts reuniting. The soil is\r\nthen drawn up around the cut, and the plant staked to prevent its\r\nbreaking off. It is said that plants so treated will form their heads\r\nfrom six to eight days earlier than they otherwise would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot do better in treating of this crop than to first quote the\r\nfollowing, by the late Peter Henderson, of New York City, from his work\r\non \"Gardening for Pleasure\":\r\n\r\n\"There is quite an ambition among amateur gardeners to raise early\r\ncauliflower, but as the conditions necessary to success with this are\r\nnot quite so easy to command as with most other vegetables, probably not\r\none in three who try it succeed. In England, and most places on the\r\nContinent of Europe, it is the most valued of all vegetables, and is\r\ngrown there nearly as easily as early cabbages. But it must be\r\nremembered that the temperature there is on the average ten degrees\r\nlower at the time it matures (June) than with us; besides, their\r\natmosphere is much more humid, two conditions essential to its proper\r\ndevelopment. I will briefly state how early cauliflowers can be most\r\nsuccessfully grown here. First, the soil must be well broken, and\r\npulverized by spading to at least a foot in depth, mixing through it a\r\nlayer of three or four inches of strong well-rotted stable manure. The\r\nplants may be either those from seed sown last fall and wintered over\r\nin cold frames, or else started from seeds sown in January or February\r\nin a hot-bed or green-house, and planted in small pots or boxes, so as\r\nto make plants strong enough to be set out as soon as the soil is fit to\r\nwork, which, in this latitude, is usually the first week in April. We\r\nare often applied to for cauliflower plants as late as May, but the\r\nchances of their forming heads when planted in May are slim indeed. The\r\nsurest way to secure the heading of cauliflowers is to use what are\r\ncalled hand-glasses. These are usually made about two feet square, which\r\ngives room enough for three or four plants of cauliflower until they are\r\nso far forwarded that the glass can be taken off. When the hand-glass is\r\nused the cauliflowers may be planted out in any warm border early in\r\nMarch and covered by them. This covering protects them from frost at\r\nnight, and gives the necessary increase of temperature for growth during\r\nthe cold weeks of March and April; so that by the first week in May, if\r\nthe cauliflower has been properly hardened off by ventilating (by\r\ntilting up the hand-glasses on one side) they may be taken off\r\naltogether and then used to forward tomatoes, melons or cucumbers. If\r\nthe weather is dry the cauliflowers will be much benefitted by being\r\nthoroughly soaked with water twice or thrice a week. * * * The two best\r\nvarieties of cauliflower we have found as yet [1875] are the Dwarf\r\nErfurt and Early Paris.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the care required for the early crop, the same writer\r\nstates in his earlier work on \"Gardening for Profit,\" (published in\r\n1867, during a period of high prices,) that \"for the past four or five\r\nyears cauliflowers [early] have been one of my most profitable crops. I\r\nhave, during that time, grown about one acre each year, which has\r\ncertainly averaged $1,500. On one occasion the crop proved almost an\r\nentire failure, owing to unusual drought in May; while, on another\r\noccasion, with an unusually favorable season, it sold at nearly $3,000\r\nper acre. The average price for all planted is about $15 per 100, and as\r\nfrom 10,000 to 12,000 are grown to the acre, it will result in nearly\r\nthe average before named--$1,500 per acre. Unlike cabbages, however,\r\nonly a limited number is yet sold, and I have found that an acre of them\r\nhas been quite as much as could be profitably grown in one garden.\"\r\n\r\nThe above, by the late well-known New York seedsman and market-gardener,\r\nthough written nearly forty years ago, is true to-day, so far as the\r\ngeneral profitableness of the cauliflower is concerned, and the extra\r\ncare required with the early crop.\r\n\r\nThe chief condition of success with early cauliflowers is that they\r\nshall head before hot weather comes on. To this end the earliest\r\nvarieties are chosen, and they are set as early as possible in the\r\nspring, and pushed rapidly forward, as stated, by using protection if\r\nnecessary, and by high manuring. It is an advantage to set the early\r\nplants between ridges, as is done with early cabbage. The ridges hold\r\nthe sun and keep off the cold winds, and the furrows between carry off\r\nthe surface water. The plants are best set upon the south or east side\r\nof the ridges, near the base. A good furrow with an ordinary plow forms\r\na sufficient ridge.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was thought necessary to start the plants in the fall, but\r\nsince the newer early sorts have been produced, this is being abandoned.\r\nFall sowing has never been as successful in the Northern United States\r\nas in England, and the failures to grow cauliflowers successfully in\r\nthis country have often resulted from adhering to the methods employed\r\nin the Old World. Plants started in hot-beds in February, and properly\r\nhardened off, receive but little check when set out, and make a better\r\ngrowth than those which have been wintered over.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of Virginia and Maryland, wintering over the young\r\nplants may be resorted to, and for gardeners in that latitude the\r\nmethods adopted in England will be well worth studying, even if they\r\ncan not be literally followed. The time for sowing the seed should be so\r\ngauged that the plants shall be neither too large nor too small during\r\nthe coldest months. If too small they will not be sufficiently hardy to\r\nwinter over; if too large they will be likely to button instead of\r\nforming fully developed heads.\r\n\r\nWhen the young plants are transplanted into their winter quarters they\r\nshould be set deeply, as the stem is the part most easily injured by\r\ncold; the same rule of planting deeply should be followed in the first\r\nplantings in the open ground in spring.\r\n\r\nWintering in the open air in a warm sheltered situation is preferable,\r\nwhere it can be done, to wintering under frames, for plants so exposed\r\nwill be most healthy and will continue their growth with least\r\ninterruption in the spring.\r\n\r\nPlants wintered under glass require considerable room, and as much air\r\nas can be safely given. If pots are used, care must be taken not to have\r\nthem too small, or to allow them to become entirely filled with the\r\nroots, for this will have a tendency to cause the plants to button.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTONING.\r\n\r\nI cannot perhaps do better than to mention here such other causes as\r\nhave this same tendency. Anything which checks the growth of the plants\r\nwhen they are a few inches high is liable to produce this result--such\r\nas leaving them too long in the seed-bed, withholding water, poor soil,\r\ntoo much crowding. After the plants are set out, a cold rainy time or\r\nbadly drained land may have the same effect; also a very hot time, if\r\nthe soil is dry and the plants are not growing well. The check\r\noccasioned by the transplanting may also cause the plants to button, if\r\nthey have become large, and the soil or weather is unfavorable. On this\r\naccount it is unsafe to let cauliflower plants get as large as cabbage\r\nplants sometimes are when transplanted.\r\n\r\nI will close this topic by quoting two paragraphs from _The Garden_, an\r\nEnglish journal from which I have already taken much valuable\r\ninformation. The first is by a person who signs himself \"D. T. F.,\" who\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Cambrian [a previous writer] attributes this to over-manuring, and no\r\ndoubt this frequently causes buttoning, but over-frosting is quite as\r\ninjurious as over-manuring; and the hard frost which we had here on the\r\n1st of April seems to be sending all the exposed plants into buttons,\r\nwhilst those protected only with glass lights seem safe and sound and\r\nare spreading their leaves wide and looking extremely promising.\"\r\n\r\nThe next writer, Mr. Gilbert, adds:\r\n\r\n\"The whole of my Early London cauliflowers have buttoned, but not the\r\nWalcheren, at least at present. I hear, too, this is the case in many\r\nparts of the country. I have for years noted that after a cold severe\r\nwinter and a warm spring both cauliflowers and cabbages 'bolt,' but this\r\nseason having been quite the reverse I thought they might have escaped.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer calls attention to the fact that plants which have been\r\nnursed or protected too much during winter are more apt to button when\r\nset out in the spring than those which have been more exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA comparatively small portion of the United States is well adapted to\r\nthe growth of cauliflower. The climate for the most part is too dry. The\r\ndistricts suited to its cultivation are often of very limited area, and\r\nare determined by local causes affecting the distribution of moisture\r\nand the character of the soil. The manner of treating the crop, and the\r\ndegree of care necessary for successful results, will therefore depend\r\nlargely on the locality where it is grown. For the purpose of giving\r\nmore definite information on these points, the country may be divided\r\ninto the following cauliflower regions:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER ATLANTIC COAST.\r\n\r\nThis includes the greatest number of localities where cauliflower\r\nculture has thus far been successfully conducted in the United States.\r\nThe region is comparatively well watered, and contains a great diversity\r\nof soil and situation. More good markets are found here than elsewhere.\r\nThe heart of this cauliflower region is now found upon the north shore\r\nof Long Island, where there is a strong soil, in a damp climate, within\r\neasy reach of the New York and other large markets. Two crops are grown\r\nhere, the spring and fall. Wm. Falconer, of Queen's County, states that\r\nfor the early crop he sows the seed in a hot-house in February, and\r\ngradually gives the plants more room and cooler quarters until they are\r\nready for the open ground. The varieties he uses are Henderson's\r\nSnowball, Early Erfurt, Stadtholder and Lenormand. He has repeatedly\r\nattempted to grow the spring crop from fall-sown plants, but they have\r\nalmost invariably buttoned, however late the seed was sown, or however\r\nslightly the plants were protected. Occasionally, also, the\r\nFebruary-sown plants of Henderson's Snowball and Erfurt will button.\r\n\r\nFor the main fall crop the same four varieties above mentioned are sown\r\nout of doors about May 18th, at the time of sowing late cabbage. For a\r\nlater crop he makes another sowing a month later. These last usually\r\nbegin to head about the last of November and are taken up and protected\r\nto furnish a supply during the winter. Mr. C. E. Swezey, of Suffolk\r\nCounty, says that more money is undoubtedly made to the acre on\r\ncauliflower than any other crop. He finds the early crop the most\r\nprofitable, although the most expensive. For this crop he uses\r\nseventy-five tons of the best horse manure per acre, and for the late\r\ncrop about half that amount. The variety he prefers is Henderson's\r\nSnowball, this with the Early Erfurt being the only kinds he uses.\r\n\r\nFrancis Brill, in his book on \"Farm Gardening and Seed Growing,\" said,\r\nin 1872, \"For the past two years the farmers of the east end of Long\r\nIsland, especially about the village of Mattituck, have planted largely\r\nof cauliflower, being incited by the successful experiments of some who\r\nhave removed here from the west end, who were formerly engaged in\r\ngrowing vegetables for the New York markets. The past season the crop\r\nhas succeeded admirably, and large profits have been realized by growers\r\nin this vicinity, and this by men, many of whom are inexperienced in the\r\ncultivation of this or any other vegetable for market; and, moreover,\r\nthe most of it was grown at the worst possible season of the year. As a\r\ngeneral rule, cauliflowers do not succeed well on old land, and much of\r\nthe land hereabouts is new, and but little of it indeed has ever been\r\nused for cabbages or anything of this nature. But beyond a doubt it is\r\nthe humid saline atmosphere of this section which makes the cultivation\r\nof this vegetable a success. Protracted drouths are here almost unknown,\r\nand even during the temporary absence of rain in the summer months the\r\nair does not seem so dry and withering, so to speak, as in sections\r\nmore remote from the ocean, the Sound and the great salt water bays by\r\nwhich we are surrounded.\" The varieties he mentions are Early Erfurt and\r\nEarly Paris for the first crop, the Nonpareil and [or] Half Early Paris\r\nfor a succession, with Lenormand and Walcheren for late.\r\n\r\nThe same author, in his work entitled \"Cauliflowers and How to Grow\r\nThem,\" published in 1886, says: \"The cultivation of cauliflower in the\r\neastern towns of Suffolk County, N. Y., familiarly known as the east end\r\nof Long Island, was begun at Mattituck about sixteen years ago, upon a\r\nsmall scale, as an experiment, by one or two gardeners from the west end\r\nwho were formerly engaged in growing vegetables for New York markets.\r\nThe success which attended these experiments, and the subsequent efforts\r\nof some of our farmers, who by reason of reported great profits, were\r\ninduced to take up the cultivation of this crop, has been an incentive\r\nto others, until at the present time an East End farm without an acre or\r\nmore of cauliflower is an exception, while in the towns of Riverhead and\r\nSouthold many farmers grow from five to fifteen acres each, and in the\r\nother towns of Suffolk County the business is largely on the increase.\r\nAs a rule the crop has done well, subject of course to the ravages of\r\ninsects, drouths, etc., which have at times been serious drawbacks;\r\nespecially was this the case in 1884, when the crop was almost a total\r\nfailure, but never before had we experienced such a protracted drouth or\r\nsuch an abundance of insects of every known species, and only those who\r\nwere in advance of the drouth, or who had sown seed very late, succeeded\r\nin getting heads for market, but the few who were thus situated received\r\nalmost fabulous prices for their product.\" The following year he says\r\nthe crop was remarkably successful, more than 100,000 barrels being\r\nshipped from Suffolk county to the New York markets during the mouths of\r\nOctober and November. \"Prices this year have ranged from ten dollars\r\nearly in the season down to one dollar and twenty-five cents a barrel\r\nduring the glut, when large quantities were sold to picklers at one cent\r\nper pound for clean trimmed clear curd or flower. As a rule early and\r\nvery late cauliflowers bring the best prices. * * * * * Experience has\r\ntaught us that stable manure applied at the time of planting, except for\r\nthe earliest spring crop, is often injurious, and I advise applying\r\nstable manure plentifully to the crop of the preceding year, or\r\notherwise let it be turned under at the fall plowing, or if well rotted\r\nat the first spring plowing, and at the time of planting apply\r\ncommercial fertilizers, or, as they are sometimes called, patent\r\nmanures, using whatever brand you may have the most confidence in. The\r\ncompetition between manufacturers has become so great that all are\r\ncompelled to be at least partially honest, and several prepare a special\r\nfertilizer for cauliflower and cabbage which works admirably. Our best\r\ngrowers all use German potash salts, or Kainit, about 13 per cent.\r\nactual potash, one ton to the acre; or sulphate of potash, equal to 27\r\nper cent. actual potash; or muriate of potash, equal to 45 per cent.\r\nactual potash, about one half a ton to the acre. The relative cost per\r\nton, of these is $16.00 for Kainit, $38.00 for sulphate and $45.00 for\r\nmuriate--these are present prices, but the market is subject to\r\nfluctuations. These should be evenly applied broadcast and turned under\r\nat the spring plowing, and from one half a ton to one ton of fertilizer\r\nto the acre should be applied in the same manner on the surface, and\r\nharrowed in at the last preparation of the soil. Of late many have been\r\nusing fish guano, which is the scrap or flesh and bone refuse from the\r\nMenhaden oil-rendering establishments, in connection with potash salts,\r\nwith excellent results; in fact Captain Edward Hawkins, of Jamesport,\r\none of our most successful growers, uses nothing else, applying one ton\r\nof each to the acre. Very good cauliflowers have been grown by opening\r\nfurrows, placing the fertilizer therein, and covering so as to form\r\nridges; but I advise broadcast manuring and flat cultivation for this\r\ncrop, as I am fully convinced that one acre in proper shape and\r\ncondition will pay much better than two acres only half fertilized.\r\nPure, fine ground bone, one ton to the acre, plowed under will be found\r\nbeneficial, especially so in carrying the plants out at the time of\r\nheading, but it is scarcely stimulating enough for the early\r\nrequirements of the plants. Well rotted stable manure may be used to\r\nadvantage, freshly applied and plowed under, for early spring planting\r\nof cold-frame or hot-bed plants which are expected to mature before\r\nextremely hot-dry weather, but it has no special advantage except to\r\nwarm up the soil. * * * The great crop with us is during the months of\r\nOctober and November, for which seed is sown from May 15 to June 25, and\r\nthe plants set from the middle of June to the last of August according\r\nto the kind.\" The varieties named for spring planting are, \"Erfurt Extra\r\nDwarf Earliest,\" and \"Small Leaved Erfurt,\" both being also good for the\r\nfall crop, the latter for this crop being sown as late as July 1st. The\r\nAlgiers, a standard sort for fall, is sown from May 15 to June 1. Mr.\r\nBrill adds: \"Every known sort has been tested by our growers, and I have\r\nhad in one field eighty-six samples, comprising every known variety and\r\nsub-variety often repeated, grown from seed procured from every possible\r\nsource, and with the exception of one or two sorts, which have done well\r\nunder peculiarly favorable conditions and circumstances, all have been\r\npositively condemned except those above named.\" The varieties referred\r\nto are the Dwarf Erfurt strains (including Henderson's), the Algiers,\r\nand the Early and Half Early Paris--the latter two being now superceded\r\nby the former.\r\n\r\nC. H. Allen, in the _American Agriculturist_ for 1889, page 297, says:\r\n\"No section of the United States seems so well adapted to the growing of\r\nthe cauliflower as the northeastern part of Long Island, N. Y. For the\r\nearliest crop a piece of heavy sod ground is plowed during the month of\r\nApril. It is then spread with fish scrap at the rate of one ton to the\r\nacre, which is thoroughly harrowed in. A strip is then prepared for\r\nsowing seed, by raking the ground until it is in good condition; the\r\nfirst sowing of seed is made May 15. The seed for the main crop is sown\r\nten to twenty days later. When the plants are ready to set the ground is\r\nagain plowed in an opposite direction from the first plowing and then\r\nspread with muriate of potash at the rate of half a ton to the acre, or\r\nif fish scrap cannot be procured, some standard fertilizer is used after\r\nthe second plowing without the addition of muriate of potash. The Early\r\nDwarf Erfurt and Snowball are the most popular varieties. The Algiers\r\nhas been largely used, but for the past two or three seasons has done\r\nvery poorly, and will not be grown in the future. The plants are set\r\nthree feet apart each way. This applies to Erfurt and Snowball; Algiers\r\nrequires the rows four feet apart.\"\r\n\r\nThe _American Garden_ for 1889, page 59, says: \"Almost nine-tenths of\r\nall the cauliflowers that come to the New York market are grown in\r\nSuffolk County on Long Island, and this industry is said to bring about\r\n$200,000 a year to the county. Success with cauliflower culture has been\r\nvery indifferent in other parts of Long Island and elsewhere where\r\ntried.\"\r\n\r\nA New Jersey market-gardener described his experience as follows a few\r\nyears ago in the New York _Tribune_: \"Among the many uncertain crops,\r\nthe cauliflower stands prominent, for very often under the best culture,\r\nit fails to produce a head on an acre, although the usual outlay for\r\npreparing and manuring the ground preparatory to planting will be at\r\nleast twice as much as for a crop of late cabbage. But when a full crop\r\nof cauliflower is raised, the profits will average three times that of\r\nthe cabbage in the same market. This being the case, it is not strange\r\nthat every means known to the profession should be resorted to with the\r\nhope of getting year after year maximum crops of this vegetable. But, as\r\nyet, no plan has been discovered, under our burning July and August sun,\r\nthat will make cauliflower head with certainty every season. Any\r\npractical man, with strong ground well manured, can every now and then\r\nraise a crop of cauliflower. But this partial success one year does very\r\noften prove a decided loss in the long run, for the reason that it often\r\nhappens three times the amount realized from this crop will be spent in\r\nthe attempt to raise another just like it, with the determination not to\r\ngive up. This has been my experience, although the experiments are made\r\nnow on a much smaller scale than formerly. Last year I set out 2,500\r\nplants, and only marketed 500 from the patch; the failure was owing to\r\nlate planting. To avoid any such mistake this year, the ground was made\r\nready for planting early in July, and by the middle of the month some\r\n1,800 plants set out. The ground in this case was richer and more mellow\r\nat the time of planting than last year, and the cultivation was about\r\nthe same. At first these plants grew vigorously, but late in August they\r\nwere checked from some unknown cause, and from this check they did not\r\nrecover. Some of the lower leaves had turned yellow and dropped off,\r\nleaving the stalks almost bare, while others have made no new growth\r\nsince. Judging from present appearances, there will not be twenty-five\r\nsizeable heads out of the 1,800 planted. This is rather discouraging,\r\nbut one has to take the good with the bad in farming or gardening. Too\r\nlate to remedy the error it was found that the variety planted was\r\nWalcheren instead of the Erfurt, a variety that has given me more\r\nprofitable returns for the last six years than any other, unless it may\r\nbe the Half Early Paris.\"\r\n\r\nIn New England the crop is more uncertain than on Long Island. W. H.\r\nBull, of Hampden County, Massachusetts, finds the crop profitable about\r\none year in three. Formerly, he says, when cauliflowers were a new\r\nthing, any kind of a head would sell, but now only the best will bring a\r\npaying price. The loose, leafy, purple, or otherwise discolored heads\r\nproduced in hot, dry weather, are hardly worth hauling to market. He\r\nfinds the Extra Early Erfurt about as good as Henderson's Snowball. He\r\nsows the seed in April for a fall crop. If sown after the first week in\r\nMay the plants fail to head before frost.\r\n\r\nAround Boston the cauliflower is grown quite successfully, and, as\r\nelsewhere stated, seed is occasionally produced there. The variety\r\nformerly grown for the main crop was an improved form of Early Paris,\r\ncalled Boston Market, but this is now displaced by the new Extra Early\r\nErfurt strains. It may be mentioned here that around Montreal the fall\r\ncrop is very successfully grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE REGION.\r\n\r\nIn the region of the Great Lakes there are many localities having a\r\nsuitable soil in which cauliflower may be grown to good advantage. The\r\nmoist atmosphere, which renders much of this region so well adapted to\r\nthe cultivation of fruit, favors the growth of the cauliflower. In this\r\nregion the fall crop is the one mainly grown, and the half-early\r\nvarieties, such as Early Paris and Early London have been chiefly used,\r\nthough the earlier Erfurt varieties are now largely grown.\r\n\r\nDetroit, Grand Rapids, and other Michigan cities are comparatively well\r\nsupplied with home-grown cauliflower.\r\n\r\nIn Western Michigan there is considerable high, rolling land, of a deep\r\nloamy character, covered originally with a heavy growth of hard-wood\r\ntimber. It was on such land as this, in Ottawa County, that the writer\r\ngrew cauliflower very successfully between the years 1870 and 1884. The\r\nland had but recently been cleared of its timber, and it seldom received\r\nany other fertilizer than the heavy June-grass sod which was turned\r\nunder. The method of preparing the ground was the same as for any other\r\nfarm crop, and the plants, mainly of the Early Paris variety, were set\r\nout about the last of June, usually four feet apart each way. They were\r\ngiven good care, and generally began to head in September, at the time\r\nof the autumnal equinox, when there is usually a week or two of cool,\r\nrainy weather. Following this, early in October, there are generally a\r\nfew hard frosts which injure some of the heads if they are not kept well\r\ncovered and closely cut. The main cauliflower season then comes on,\r\nrunning through October and the first half of November. In a warm, late\r\nseason nearly all the plants will have headed, and the heads have been\r\nsold before cold weather, but when winter comes on early, a portion of\r\nthe plants will be still undeveloped; these are either gathered and\r\nstored, as elsewhere described, or used for feeding stock. My crop was\r\nmarketed at Grand Rapids and Chicago, and was considered the finest sent\r\nto either of those cities. Its excellence was attributed mainly to the\r\ndeep new fertile soil, which never suffered from drouth under proper\r\ncultivation, and to the moist climate, due to the surrounding forests\r\nand the proximity to Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nAt South Haven, on the immediate shore of Lake Michigan, the upland is\r\nmainly too heavy for the best growth of cauliflower. Mr. Sheffer says:\r\n(Mich. Ag. Rep. 1888, p. 287) \"We have the advantage of cheap lands,\r\ncheap transportation to a boundless market, and a moist climate, all\r\nmaking celery and cauliflower desirable crops. For cauliflower, the\r\nproper soil is the first essential. If planted on uplands it will fail\r\nnine times out of ten, unless set so late as to head up just before\r\nwinter. But it is better to grow it on low wet soils that can be ditched\r\nas far away as Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nIn Kent County, with which I am familiar, the cauliflower is\r\nsuccessfully cultivated by many gardeners, but, as the air is drier,\r\nmore care is required there in selecting the soil, the crop being\r\nusually grown on bottom lands favorably situated with regard to\r\nmoisture, and containing an abundance of vegetable matter. It is\r\noccasionally grown on muck, but such land is not as reliable as that of\r\na heavier character. On the light, sandy, and gravelly uplands, which\r\nabound in this county, the cultivation of the cauliflower is seldom\r\nattempted, and always fails, except in unusually wet seasons, although\r\nwhen such land is heavily manured, the cabbage may be grown\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nAt Duluth, Minnesota, near the western end of Lake Superior, I have seen\r\nas fine cauliflowers growing as I ever saw anywhere. The soil was black\r\nloamy, upland.\r\n\r\nMr. J. S. Brocklehurst, of Oneota, in the same county, considers his\r\nlocality unsurpassed for the cauliflower.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Wisconsin there is considerable territory which is excellent\r\nfor cauliflower. In 1890, the first, second and third prizes offered by\r\nJames Vick, for the best heads of Vick's Ideal were all awarded to\r\ngrowers in Eau Clare County, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe recent introduction of very early varieties is likely to have an\r\nimportant result in extending the cultivation of the cauliflower, in the\r\nextreme Northern States and Canada, where the soil and climate are in\r\nmany places peculiarly adapted to it, but where the seasons are so short\r\nthat it has not heretofore been successfully grown.\r\n\r\nAround Chicago much of the soil is unsurpassed for this vegetable, and\r\nlarge quantities of it are grown, but not enough to supply its local\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThe most successful cultivators of this vegetable near Chicago are the\r\nmarket gardeners in the Holland settlement south of the city, and the\r\nGermans on the north. All are more successful with the late crop than\r\nwith the early. One of the most successful of these growers sometimes\r\nsets his plants as late as the first of August, using seed direct from\r\nfriends in Holland.\r\n\r\nIn Mahoning County, Ohio, which may be included, for convenience, in the\r\nLake Region, Mr. Milton, who makes a specialty of the cauliflower,\r\nstates that it is a good paying crop, but requires high cultivation, and\r\nif possible a moist soil. He states that he has tried all the varieties\r\nin cultivation, and finds a great difference in seed of the same variety\r\nfrom different growers. For the early crop he one year planted\r\nHenderson's Snowball, extra selected Early Erfurt, and Vick's Ideal, and\r\nfound, owing to a drouth which set in just as the heads began to form,\r\nthat the last variety was the only one which gave paying heads. For a\r\nlate crop he generally uses Half-Early Paris, but has had good success\r\nwith Algiers in a warm season. This variety must be started very early,\r\nhowever, in order to head before winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE REGION.\r\n\r\nPrairie soil is usually well adapted to the cauliflower, and in\r\nfavorable seasons a good crop is obtained, but such seasons are so\r\nlittle to be depended on in this region that cauliflower culture on a\r\nlarge scale is only profitable here under irrigation, or in restricted\r\nlocalities where the soil is naturally moist.\r\n\r\nThe gardeners around St. Louis have good success in growing cauliflower\r\non the bottom land. Professor L. R. Taft says, \"During two of the years\r\nI lived in Missouri it was very hot and dry and on the heavy clay soil\r\nof most of the state cauliflower, as a field crop, was a failure. I had\r\ngood success, however, by planting one foot apart in cold frames from\r\nwhich lettuce had been taken; they were watered as required and during\r\nthe hottest weather were protected to some extent by means of lath\r\nscreens.\"\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage in this uncertainty of a crop in the West is its effect\r\nupon the market. A product which is rarely seen in the market brings a\r\nlow price when abundant and fails to bring a high price in times of\r\nscarcity. Few people use it, and these do not become so accustomed to it\r\nas to be willing to pay a high price for it when it is scarce.\r\n\r\nMr. Riche, of Iowa, tells in a report of the Iowa Horticultural Society,\r\nhow, in 1884, he overstocked the Dubuque market with 8000 heads. A Mr.\r\nSmith relates how, a few years previous, he was obliged to sell 4000\r\nheads for a little over one cent per head; yet in this same market more\r\nfamiliar products often bring high prices. Another Iowa gardener grew a\r\nfield of cauliflower by mistake, having purchased the seed for cabbage,\r\nand found himself unable to sell the crop at all!\r\n\r\nIn the irrigated districts of the West, cauliflower is grown to great\r\nperfection. One of the largest cauliflowers on record, four feet three\r\ninches in circumference, was grown in Colorado under irrigation in 1881.\r\nA moist atmosphere is less important than plenty of water at the root,\r\nespecially at the time of heading, when it should be supplied, if\r\npossible, in small amount every day. The somewhat saline character of\r\nthe soil in the dry regions also favors the growth of this crop whenever\r\na sufficient supply of water is given.\r\n\r\nAt the Colorado experiment station sixteen varieties were grown under\r\nirrigation in 1888 (see table under Variety Tests), of which\r\nHenderson's Snowball and Extra Early Erfurt gave the best results. At\r\nthe Arkansas station, the following year, out of twelve varieties these\r\ntwo were the only ones that produced heads. At the South Dakota station,\r\nHenderson's Snowball and Haskell's Favorite, a variety apparently\r\nidentical with it, gave good results.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower, as a market crop, is but little grown in the South, but\r\nthere is no good reason why it should not become extensively cultivated\r\nthere. The chief hindrances to its cultivation in the South have been\r\nthe lack of high priced local markets, and the liability of the heads to\r\nheat during transportation to the North.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable localities for growing this vegetable in the South\r\nare near the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, especially near the mouths of\r\nrivers where there is an alluvial soil and a moist atmosphere. The\r\ncauliflower is better adapted than the cabbage to a warm climate, but\r\nheavier soil is required for it in the South than at the North.\r\n\r\nW. F. Massey, of the North Carolina experiment station, says that\r\nfall-sown plants are the only ones worth growing in that latitude. The\r\nseed should be sown in September. The crop should head not later than\r\nMarch or April, as the heat is too great after April for good heads. By\r\nforcing, the plants may be headed in the frames in winter. More heat and\r\nprotection are needed for this than in merely keeping over the plants.\r\nWhen the plants are approaching full size a light dressing of nitrate of\r\nsoda raked into the soil is used to push them along and check any\r\ntendency to button. Lettuce is usually grown in the frames between the\r\nplants while small.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Oemler,[A] of Savannah, Georgia, says: \"If this most delicate and\r\nmost valuable member of the Brassica family, would 'carry' more safely\r\nat locations suitable for its cultivation, it would be one of the most\r\nimportant crops for the truck farmer. Although so situated, I have\r\nabandoned its culture, notwithstanding I have netted as high as $24.75\r\nin New York per barrel for it, and the heads or 'curds' have sold at a\r\ngross average of thirty-seven cents each. Sometimes, however, it would\r\ncontinue to arrive in such bad order as not to be worth shipping. For\r\nthe past two years its culture for the Northern market has been mainly\r\nconfined to Florida. Coming so much earlier there, it is not exposed to\r\nheating in transit. The best varieties are Extra Early Dwarf Erfurt,\r\nthe Snowball, and the very large growing Algiers. It should be\r\nmarketable in March and April. The seed therefore should be sown in the\r\nlatitude of Savannah about December first, under glass, and the plants\r\ntransplanted about January tenth.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Mohr, of Mobile, Alabama, writes: \"From my own experience I\r\njudge that this vegetable does not succeed as well in the southern part\r\nof this state as in its central and more northern parts. I have seen it\r\nraised of good quality in the gardens of Montgomery, and in the greatest\r\nperfection in the highlands of north Alabama at an elevation of about\r\n500 feet above the Gulf--at Cullman, in a somewhat light loamy soil,\r\nwell supplied with stable manure. In that locality the seeds are sown by\r\nthe end of February in a cold frame, to allow protection of the young\r\nplants from frost, and the plants are transferred to the open land by\r\nthe middle of March. They arrive at their perfection during the first\r\nhalf of the month of May. Another sowing is made during the first week\r\nof March to furnish a crop during the early part of June. In that\r\nlocality this vegetable is raised only to meet a very limited home\r\ndemand. My informant at Montgomery, who raises only a supply for his own\r\nuse, writes: 'I have raised cauliflower here with success for a series\r\nof years, some of the heads weighing six to seven pounds. The soil of\r\nmy garden is a light sandy loam, requiring heavy manuring, and frequent\r\nirrigation of the plants toward the time of heading; it cannot be said\r\nto be exactly suited to this vegetable. I get my seed (the White\r\nSnowball) from Peter Henderson, of New York, sow in December in hot-bed,\r\ntransplant as soon as large enough to a cold frame, and transplant as\r\nsoon as danger of frost is over, say about the first part or middle of\r\nMarch, to the open ground, which has been well prepared and manured with\r\nstable manure. I cultivate the same as for cabbage, and the crop matures\r\nabout the first of May.'\r\n\r\n\"One of the most successful market gardeners and truck farmers in this\r\nvicinity [Mobile], says: 'We have cultivated cauliflower for a long\r\nseries of years, but find it much less profitable than the raising of\r\ncabbage; first, on account of its tenderness, making it liable to be\r\ninjured in transportation to distant markets, and second, by reason of\r\nrepeated failure of the crop in consequence of the too early advent of\r\nspells of hot and dry weather at the opening of the warm season. We sow\r\nin November in cold frame, keep well thinned out under glass until about\r\nthe 20th of January, then transplant to the open ground, cultivating\r\nwell with frequent watering if the weather should be dry. If the months\r\nof April and May are dry and hot the crop results in a failure, from\r\nwhich, in our dry and thirsty soil, no irrigation will save it. In\r\nfavorable seasons we have fine results, raising heads from ten to\r\nsixteen inches in diameter. In the perpetually damp and inexhaustibly\r\nfertile soil of the alluvial lands in the Mobile River delta (marshes\r\ndrained by ditching) the cauliflower is raised in the greatest\r\nperfection, and is ready by Christmas time for the home market, bringing\r\nfancy prices. In such localities the early varieties, particularly the\r\nEarly Paris, are used, the seed being sown in August. Outside of these\r\nmarshes the early varieties are not grown, as they produce only small\r\nand meagre heads. Among the later varieties we find Algiers and\r\nLenormand the best, buying the seed from Vilmorin in Paris.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. N. Whitner, in his work on \"Gardening in Florida,\" recommends\r\nEarly Snowball, Extra Early Paris, and Extra Early Dwarf Erfurt. The\r\nseed is sown in boxes in autumn and protected from beating rains, and if\r\nsown before the middle of October the plants are also protected from the\r\ndirect sun during the middle of the day. The main crop is planted out\r\nbefore the first of November, and harvested the following spring. In the\r\nnorthern portion of the state the plants are sometimes injured by the\r\ncold in winter. The crop is not yet extensively grown in that state. In\r\nregard to suitable soil, Mr. Whitner says:\r\n\r\n\"In this state almost every truck farmer has some low rich spot of\r\nbottom, lake or river margin suitable for the production of the\r\ncauliflower. It must, however, be well drained land, and no matter how\r\nfertile it may _seem_ to be naturally, a liberal supply of manure will\r\nmore certainly insure handsome flower heads.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frotzer, a New Orleans seedsman, says of the cauliflower:\r\n\r\n\"This is one of the finest vegetables grown, and succeeds well in the\r\nvicinity of New Orleans. Large quantities are raised on the sea-coast in\r\nthe neighborhood of Barataria Bay. The two Italian varieties are of\r\nexcellent quality, growing to large size, and are considered hardier\r\nthan the German and French varieties. I have had specimens brought to my\r\nstore, raised from seed obtained from me, weighing sixteen pounds. The\r\nground for planting cauliflower should be very rich. They thrive best in\r\nrich, sandy soil, and require plenty of moisture during the formation of\r\nthe head. The Italian varieties should be sown from April till July; the\r\nlatter month and June is the best time to sow the Early Giant. During\r\nAugust, September and October, the Lenormand, Half Early Paris and\r\nErfurt can be sown. The Half Early Paris is very popular, but the other\r\nvarieties are just as good. For spring crop the Italian kinds do not\r\nanswer, but the Early French and German varieties can be sown at the end\r\nof December and during January, in a bed protected from frost, and may\r\nbe transplanted into the open ground during February and as late as\r\nMarch. If we have a favorable season, and not too dry, they will be very\r\nfine; but if the heat sets in soon, the flowers will not attain the same\r\nsize as those obtained from seeds sown in fall, and which head during\r\nDecember and January.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Texas Farm and Ranch_, H. M. Stringfellow, of Hitchcock,\r\nGalveston County, gives an account of his success with American grown\r\n(Puget Sound) seed of Henderson's Snowball cauliflower. He says:\r\n\r\n\"After two years careful trial, I have found this seed every way\r\nsuperior to the original imported stock, good as that was, for our hot\r\nclimate. The plants are much more robust, make equally as compact but\r\nlarger heads, and what is most remarkable, they mature here fully two\r\nweeks or more ahead of the imported seed. Nearly every plant will make a\r\nmarketable head, and they always sell for fully double as much as\r\ncabbage.\r\n\r\n\"These American seeds begin to head about the first of November, and are\r\nnearly all gone by Christmas, which gives ample time to get the crop\r\noff in any part of Texas.\r\n\r\n\"The cauliflower is emphatically a fall vegetable and seems to require\r\nfor its perfect development a gradually decreasing temperature. The seed\r\nshould be sowed from the first to the fifteenth of July, in a frame.\r\nMake the ground very rich, and if you use salt, which I consider almost\r\nan essential for this crop, turn it under deeply at the first plowing.\r\nIn fact, salt and potash had better be deeply worked into the soil\r\nalways, as it will not do for either to come in contact with the roots\r\nof a newly set plant.\r\n\r\n\"Until recently I have always thought that it would injure a plant to\r\nset it in soil to which cottonseed meal had been lately applied. But\r\nexperiments made in the last few weeks prove that it is not only not\r\ninjurious, but that cabbage plants grow off with wonderful vigor when\r\nthe meal was applied the day before the plants were set.\r\n\r\n\"It will pay to subsoil for cauliflower, in order to give them all the\r\nmoisture possible, though they will stand a drouth in the fall equally\r\nas well as a cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be mentioned the following account of cauliflower\r\ngrowing at Durango, Mexico, sent to the _Gardener's Chronicle_ in 1853:\r\nThe writer says: \"Of the culinary vegetables, none excel the\r\ncauliflower, which attains such a size that a single head measures 18\r\ninches to 2 feet in diameter, and makes a donkey load. The gigantic\r\ncauliflower is not distinct from our European species, but is solely\r\nproduced by a cultivation which necessity has dictated. Being one of the\r\nNorthern vegetables that degenerate or bear no seed if not annually\r\nprocured from Europe, it is propagated by cuttings. After the heads are\r\ngathered the stubs are allowed to throw out new shoots, which are again\r\nplanted and have to grow two years, producing the second, the enormous\r\nheads.\"\r\n\r\nThe following from Woodrow's \"Gardening in India,\" (4th edition, Bombay,\r\n1888), contains many interesting points of suggestive value for the\r\nextreme South:\r\n\r\n\"Cauliflower, being a delicate plant, always needs great care and\r\nattention in its cultivation, but much less care is necessary in this\r\ncountry than in Europe. The soil most suitable is a rich friable loam,\r\nsuch as occurs in the black soil of the Duccan, the alluvial tracts in\r\nthe basin of the Ganges or Nerbudda. Thorough working of the soil is\r\nnecessary, and in stations where the market price of cauliflower is\r\nusually over four annas per head, as is the case in many parts of\r\nSouthern India, the crop is well worth extra care in the preparation of\r\nthe soil. This process should be begun shortly after the rains, when the\r\nsoil is easily plowed or dug. It should then be turned up roughly to a\r\ndepth of a foot or fifteen inches. A month later the clods should be\r\nbroken with the mallet or clod crusher, and the plow put through the\r\nground a second time. When the soil has weathered a few weeks, the\r\nscarifier or cultivator should be run over it once monthly until May. At\r\nthat time good decayed cow dung or poudrette should be spread one inch\r\ndeep, and any close growing crop which is not valuable, such as _sunn_,\r\n_tag_, _chanamoo_, or _Crotolaria juncea_, should be sown to keep down\r\nweeds and encourage the formation of nitric acid in the soil, which has\r\nbeen proved to be effected to a greater extent under a crop than on bare\r\nsoil. During dry weather in August the crop should be pulled up and the\r\nground plowed or dug and the crop buried in the trenches to act as green\r\nmanure, and the land prepared for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe seed-bed should be prepared by thorough digging and mixing about an\r\ninch in depth of old manure; wood ashes and decayed sweepings having a\r\nquantity of goat or sheep dung in it is well suited for the seed-bed at\r\nthis season. Cow dung is apt to have the larva of the dung beetle in\r\nit--a very large caterpillar which destroys young plants by eating\r\nthrough the stem under ground. The bed having been thoroughly watered,\r\nthe seed may be sown broadcast or in lines, and covered with a quarter\r\nof an inch of fine, dry, sandy soil, and shaded from bright sunshine.\r\nWhen the seedlings appear, gradually remove the shade. The most\r\nconvenient form of bed is not more than four feet in width, the length\r\nbeing sufficient for the ground to be planted. One ounce of seed is\r\nsufficient for a bed fifty feet square, which will give sufficient\r\nplants for an acre if the seed is good. Sowing should be made once in\r\nten days, from the middle of August till the end of September. If the\r\ngarden has been neglected, or the district remarkable for the quantity\r\nof grubs that yearly come out in August, spread a considerable part of\r\nthe garden with a thick coating of stable litter or dry leaves and burn\r\nit, prepare the seed bed in the middle of the burnt space, and soak two\r\npounds of saltpetre in water for one hundred square feet, and water the\r\nbed with it for at least two weeks before sowing the seed. When the\r\nseedlings have acquired about five leaves, and the ground to plant is\r\nready, lift the young plants gently on a cloudy day, and plant them out\r\ntwo and one-half feet apart each way. If bright sunshine comes out,\r\nshade the newly moved plants with broad leaves, and water them daily\r\nwith the watering pot for a few days, besides irrigating sufficiently\r\nto keep the soil moist. Afterwards, hoeing, picking grubs and replacing\r\nthe losses from the seed-bed must be attended to.\r\n\r\nThe selection of sorts is a serious matter in cauliflower culture,\r\nbecause many sorts grow only to leaves in some climates, and great loss\r\nhas been met with by some people in consequence of getting the wrong\r\nvariety. The variety known to English seedsmen as Large Asiatic, has\r\nestablished itself in the Northern Provinces, where a good head of\r\ncauliflower is procurable in December for one-half anna. In Bombay the\r\nsame would cost ten times that sum. The seed of this variety is\r\nremarkably cheap in the districts it bears seed in. From Shajehanpore I\r\nbought large quantities at Rs. 2 per pound, while the price of seed from\r\nEngland was Rs. 2 per ounce. This sort is perfectly reliable when\r\nproperly cultivated, but it is considered inferior in flavor and\r\ndelicacy to English sorts, and its season is very short. It appears to\r\nrun to seed when January comes, at whatever time it may have been sown,\r\nwhile English varieties come into use from the beginning of December to\r\nthe end of February according to the date of sowing.\r\n\r\nAmong European varieties, success will generally be met with by sowing\r\nEarly London and Walcheren. The different Giant and Mammoth varieties\r\nadvertised in seedsmen's catalogues should be grown as extras, and if\r\none is found to suit the soil and climate of a particular station, it\r\nmay be grown more extensively afterwards; my experience with those\r\nvarieties has not been happy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC COAST.\r\n\r\nFine early cauliflowers are grown in California under irrigation, and\r\nmarketed as far east as Chicago. Oregon and Washington include a large\r\narea adapted to cauliflower growing, and this favorable territory\r\nextends northward into Alaska. The cool, moist climate of the Upper\r\nPacific coast resembles that of England, where cauliflowers are so\r\nextensively grown.\r\n\r\nThere are few good markets yet in this region, but the rapid growth of\r\nthe cities which exist affords promise of a large future demand for this\r\nvegetable, which is likely to come into more general use as it becomes\r\nbetter known.\r\n\r\nProfessor E. R. Lake, of the Oregon experiment station, states that some\r\nparts of the Oregon coast are well adapted to the cauliflower, but that\r\nother interests and lack of transportation facilities have thus far\r\nprevented its cultivation for market, the bulk of the crop sold there\r\ncoming from California. He adds that the Chinese in the vicinity of\r\nPortland cultivate this vegetable, but that their peculiar methods are\r\nnot yet understood.\r\n\r\nSome ten years ago experiments were begun by one of our seedsmen in\r\nraising cauliflower and cabbage seed on the alluvial tide lands on the\r\nshore of Puget Sound. These lands, after being diked and drained, proved\r\nto be remarkably well adapted to the growth of the cauliflower and its\r\nseed. Others have since engaged in growing these seeds in the same\r\nregion, and the business is assuming large proportions. An account of\r\nthis enterprise may be found in the chapter on Seed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Dr. Oemler is the author of an excellent work entitled \"Truck\r\nFarming in the South.\" His farm is on Wilmington Island, in the mouth of\r\nthe Savannah River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINSECT AND FUNGUS ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insect enemies of the cauliflower are the same as those which attack\r\nthe cabbage and other related plants. The four here mentioned require to\r\nbe specially guarded against. In preparing these notes I am indebted to\r\nMr. L. O. Howard, of the Department of Agriculture, at Washington, for\r\nessential aid.\r\n\r\nFLEA BEETLE (_Phyllotrea striolata_, Fabr).--This insect, also\r\nknown as the \"ground flea\" or \"Jack,\" seldom attacks the plants except\r\nwhile growing in the open ground, and is most troublesome in warm,\r\nsheltered situations. A safe preventive, therefore, is to grow the\r\nplants in beds or frames elevated about three feet from the ground. The\r\nobjection to this method, aside from the extra labor involved, is the\r\nnecessity of almost daily attention to see that the soil does not dry\r\nout. A supply of water must be conveniently at hand if this method is\r\nused, and it is desirable also, to prevent the beds drying out too\r\nquickly, to have the earth at least eight inches deep. In hot-beds this\r\ninsect is seldom troublesome, being probably repelled by the fumes from\r\nthe manure used. When the seed is sown in the open ground, as practised\r\nby many large growers, an extra quantity should be used to ensure\r\nagainst almost certain loss of some of the plants by the flea beetle.\r\nThe soil should be rich and fine, so that the plants will pass the\r\ncritical stage as quickly as possible. Sowing radish seeds with the\r\ncauliflower is practised by some, as this seed costs but little, and the\r\nradishes, coming up first, are attacked by the fleas, which, to some\r\nextent, saves the cauliflowers. When the fleas appear, almost any kind\r\nof dust will keep them in check somewhat. Lime and ashes are used, but\r\nplaster, which adheres to the leaves better, seems equally good. I have\r\nhad good success with rancid fish oil, mixed as thoroughly as possible\r\nwith water and sprayed upon the plants. An emulsion made of the oil, in\r\nthe same manner as hereafter described for kerosene, would enable it to\r\nbe used to better advantage. A decoction of tobacco, or fine tobacco\r\ndust, are standard remedies for this insect.\r\n\r\nCUT WORMS.--Cauliflower plants being fully twice as valuable as\r\ncabbage plants, and it being of more importance to have them started at\r\nthe proper time, it is necessary to give greater care to protect them\r\nfrom cut worms. Absolutely clean land contains no cut worms, but such\r\nland is seldom used on which to plant cauliflower. Sod land, which is\r\ngenerally used, is nearly always full of cut worms. A multitude of\r\nremedies have been proposed for this pest, but few of them are of much\r\nvalue. The worms are most abundant and destructive in the latitude of\r\nNew York during the month of May. Fortunately, cauliflowers are usually\r\nset out either earlier than this, for the early crop, so that they\r\nbecome well established and out of reach before their depredations\r\nseriously begin, or else, for the late crop, they are set toward the\r\nlast of June, after the worms have begun to pupate, and are no longer\r\ntroublesome. Until recently, digging and killing the worms by hand\r\nseemed to be almost the only practical remedy. Of late years, trapping\r\nthe worms under bunches of grass or cabbage leaves, scattered over the\r\nground preparatory to setting the plants, has been successfully resorted\r\nto. An improvement upon this method, recommended by the Entomologist of\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture, is now in use, and gives\r\nexcellent satisfaction. It consists in poisoning with Paris green the\r\nleaves used to trap the worms, so that there is no need to collect and\r\nkill the worms by hand. A good way to do this is to spray with Paris\r\ngreen, in the usual way, a patch of young clover, then cut it and\r\nscatter it in small bunches over the cauliflower field a day or two\r\nbefore setting the plants. For the protection of a few plants in the\r\ngarden, an effectual preventive against cut worms is to surround the\r\nstem with a cylinder of paper or tin. This need not touch the plant. One\r\nshould expect to lose some plants, however, by cut worms, and be\r\nprepared with good plants to fill the vacancies.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE MAGGOT (_Anthomya brassicæ_, Bouché)--Dr. J. A.\r\nLintner, State Entomologist of New York, says of this insect: \"This is\r\nprobably the most injurious species of the _Anthomyiidæ_, as its\r\ndistribution is very extensive, both in Europe and America, and it has\r\nshown at times such capacity for multiplication as to cause the entire\r\ndestruction of cabbage crops. It commences its attack upon the young\r\nplants while yet in the seed-bed and continues to infest them, in\r\nseveral successive broods, until they are taken up in the autumn. The\r\nlarvæ operate by consuming the rootlets of young plants, and by\r\nexcoriating the surface and eating into the rind of older ones, or even\r\npenetrating into the interior of the root. When they abound to the\r\nextent of seriously burrowing the stalk the decay of the root frequently\r\nfollows in wet seasons, and entire fields are thus destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe same insect attacks the turnip, cauliflower, and probably other\r\nplants. A closely related species is very injurious to the radish. The\r\npresence of the insect most frequently becomes manifest upon the\r\ncauliflower about two weeks after the plants are set out, and is\r\nrecognized by the plants ceasing to grow, and wilting or assuming a\r\nbluish appearance. Such plants should be at once removed, together with\r\nthe earth immediately surrounding the root, and fresh plants which have\r\nbeen held in reserve set in their places. The only satisfactory remedies\r\nare preventive ones. The seed-bed should be composed of soil taken from\r\nthe woods, or at least from some place where no cabbages or similar\r\nplants have been grown. But the most important precaution is to avoid\r\ngrowing the crop year after year upon the same ground, especially after\r\nthe insect has made its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe following remedy, given by Francis Brill, in his pamphlet on\r\n\"Cauliflowers,\" is worthy of careful trial. Mr. Brill says: \"The ravages\r\nof the root maggot have made the growing of early cauliflower, and even\r\nearly cabbages in many sections, almost an impossibility, but there is a\r\nremedy, when the maggot has attacked the roots of the plants, which may\r\nbe known by a tendency of the leaves to wilt and droop in the heat of\r\nthe day, very much the same as when affected by club root. Dissolve\r\nMuriate of Potash (analyzing 45 per cent. actual potash) in water in the\r\nproportion of one tablespoonful to the gallon; or double the quantity of\r\nKainit or common potash salts (13 per cent. actual potash). Apply this\r\ndirectly to the roots, about one gill to each plant, whether seemingly\r\naffected or not, for the maggot will have done much harm before the\r\nplant will show it, repeating the application as occasion may seem to\r\nrequire. In sections where these maggots have been prevalent it will be\r\nwell to make a solution of half the above strength, and when the plants\r\nare nicely started apply in the same manner as a preventive. Care and\r\njudgment must be used not to overdo the matter, thereby killing the\r\nplants as well as the maggots. Experiment a little at first.\"\r\n\r\nH. A. March, of Washington, says: \"The best thing that I have found for\r\nthe maggot is a _poor_ grade of sulphur, sulphur before being purified,\r\nthat _smells very strong_. Sprinkled over the plants it seems to drive\r\nthe fly away.\"\r\n\r\nCABBAGE WORM (_Pieris rapæ_, Koch).--The imported cabbage worm,\r\nnow known all over the country, is the most troublesome enemy which\r\nattacks either the cabbage or cauliflower, and the most difficult one\r\nwith which to deal. It seldom wholly destroys the crop, and is generally\r\na little less destructive after a few years than it is at first, being\r\nkept in check by its natural enemies. It never disappears, however, and\r\nits numbers cannot be materially diminished for any length of time by\r\nartificial means. Among the partial remedies in use are the following:\r\n\r\n1. Catch the butterflies with a net when they first appear in spring,\r\nbefore they have laid their eggs. This may keep the insect in check for\r\na year or two when it first makes its appearance, as the butterflies are\r\ncomparatively slow fliers, and may be caught without much difficulty by\r\na spry boy, especially in the morning when the air is damp.\r\n\r\n2. Early in the season keep the young plants excluded from the\r\nbutterflies, and the whole place free from everything else of the\r\ncabbage tribe, except one or more patches of rutabagas or rape, on which\r\nthe butterflies will lay their eggs. This piece is to be then plowed\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n3. Hand pick the worms from the plants after they are set out, for the\r\nfirst one or two hoeings, or until the worms become very numerous.\r\n\r\n4. Spray with kerosene emulsion, made by using two gallons of kerosene,\r\none-half pound of common or whale oil soap, and one gallon of water.\r\nDissolve the soap in the water, and add it, boiling hot, to the\r\nkerosene; then churn, while at least warm, for five or ten minutes, by\r\nmeans of a force pump and spraying nozzle, until the mixture loses its\r\noiliness and becomes like butter. When used, dilute one part of the\r\nemulsion with about fifteen of water, and spray it upon the plants by\r\nmeans of a force pump and spraying nozzle. This emulsion is also\r\nexcellent for the cabbage louse and many other insects. In the report of\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture for 1883 may be found a\r\ndescription and figure of a suitable spraying apparatus.\r\n\r\n5. Pyrethrum, one ounce to four gallons of water; or, better still,\r\nmixed one part with about twenty parts of flour and applied while the\r\ndew is on, is an effectual remedy.\r\n\r\n6. Hot water, at 130° Fah., will kill the cabbage worms and not injure\r\nthe leaves. Boiling water, placed in sprinkling cans and taken directly\r\nto the field, will be about the right temperature by the time it can be\r\napplied. Experiments with a few plants may be needed to enable one to\r\nget just the right temperature to kill the worms and not injure the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n7. Take half a pound of London purple to thirty pounds of finely\r\npulverized dust of any kind, the finer and drier the better; mix\r\nthoroughly, passing all through a meal sieve. Dash a small pinch into\r\nthe heart of the plant, so that it will settle as dust on all the\r\nleaves. Repeat after every rain. Half a pound will serve for one\r\napplication over forty acres. Store any that remains in a very dry place\r\nuntil again wanted.\r\n\r\n8. Professor Gillette, of Colorado, finds the best remedy to be Paris\r\ngreen, thoroughly mixed, one ounce with six pounds of flour, and dusted\r\nlightly over the plants while the dew is on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGUS DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThere are several parasitic fungi which are more or less destructive to\r\nthe cauliflower at different stages of its growth. The principal\r\ndiseases of the cauliflower due to fungi are the following:\r\n\r\nSTEM ROT.--This is an old disease, which attacks the\r\ncauliflower, cabbage and other vegetables in wet seasons. It has\r\nreceived various other names, such as \"consumption,\" \"humid gangrene,\"\r\netc. Professor Comes,[B] who has studied this disease in Italy, believes\r\nit to be the same as the \"humid gangrene\" which occurs in Germany, and\r\nwhich is there attributed to the parasitic attack of the fungus known as\r\n_Pleospora Napi_. He finds this and other fungi present, but does not\r\nhimself consider them the direct cause of the disease, which he\r\nattributes solely to the abundance of manure and moisture in the soil,\r\nand an excess of water in the plant, at a time when it is subject to\r\nsudden changes of temperature. Beyond a doubt, however, the real cause\r\nof the disease is the presence of one or more fungi, whose development\r\nis favored by the damp weather. The subject requires further study.\r\n\r\nIn this country this disease has been reported from Michigan, New York,\r\nMaryland and Florida. On Long Island, in 1889,[C] the cauliflower crop\r\nwas almost entirely destroyed by this disease, which was attributed to\r\nthe heavy rains at the time the plants were heading. Some fields were a\r\ntotal loss, and from the best fields many of the heads spoiled before\r\nthey reached the market.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory remedy is known for the disease. The avoidance of damp\r\nsoils and locations would be of some benefit, but is hardly practicable\r\nwith the cauliflower. Wide planting is practiced on Long Island in order\r\nto diminish the tendency to the disease. It undoubtedly has this effect\r\nto some extent, by permitting a more free circulation of the air, thus\r\ndrying up the moisture on the plants and thereby lessening the\r\nopportunity for the germination of the spores. The increased distance\r\nmay also diminish the chance of the spread of the spores from plant to\r\nplant. When this disease appears upon the early crop in hot-beds or cold\r\nframes it may be kept somewhat in check by giving as much air as\r\npossible, and taking care not to apply water to the leaves.\r\n\r\nDAMPING OFF.--This is usually due to a species of Pythium (a\r\nfungus closely related to that which causes the potato rot), which\r\nattacks the young plants soon after they germinate. The remedy is, to\r\ngive the plants plenty of air until their stems become strong enough to\r\nresist its attacks. An additional precaution sometimes employed is to\r\ngrow the plants in pans or small boxes and water them only by setting\r\nthese in a tank of water of nearly the same depth, allowing the water to\r\nsoak into the soil, but not touch the plants. The disease is seldom\r\ntroublesome on plants grown thinly in the open air. If it makes its\r\nappearance, water thoroughly, but not too often, and sprinkle dry sand\r\nover the seed-bed among the plants.[D]\r\n\r\nBLACK LEG OR MILDEW.--This is a disease which attacks the stems\r\nof young plants which are being wintered over. It is undoubtedly due to\r\none or more species of parasitic fungi, but I do not find that the\r\nsubject has been studied. Doubtless the rupture of the bark by alternate\r\nfreezing and thawing gives the fungi an opportunity to attack the plant.\r\nThe disease is prevented and kept in check by keeping the seed-bed dry.\r\nAn occasional dressing of sand, lime, wood-ashes or rubbish of any kind,\r\nis useful.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] _Bull. Soc. Bot. France, 1886_ (_Rev. Bib._, p. 128). La cancrena\r\ndel Cavolo Fiore (_La gangrene humide du Chou-fleur_) par M. le\r\nProfessor O. Comes (_Atti del R. Instituto del incorraggiamento alle\r\nScienzie naturali._--Estratta dal Vol. IV, 3a serie, degli Atti\r\nAcademici, 1885). [The Humid Gangrene of the Cauliflower.]\r\n\r\n\"A disease which attacks the crops of cauliflower around Resina and at\r\nTorre del Greco, near Naples. The roots of the diseased plants remain\r\nsound, or at least appear so, but the subterranean parts of the stem are\r\nmore or less seriously affected; the bark is disorganized, the wood\r\nsituated beneath it more or less decomposed, and the pith destroyed for\r\na variable length. Upon microscopic examination the vessels are found\r\nfilled with gum. M. Comes recognizes in this disease all the symptoms of\r\nthe affection which has been designated under the name humid gangrene.\r\nHe thinks that it is the same disease which, by German authors, is\r\nattributed to the parasitism of _Pleospora Napi_, Fuckel, or to its\r\nconidiferous form, _sporidesmium excitosum_, Kuehn. But he considers the\r\npresence of these parasites as an accessory phenomenon, as well as that\r\nof _Cladosporium_ and _Macrosporium Brassicæ_. In his opinion the true\r\ncause of the alteration of the cauliflower is the humid gangrene, that\r\nis to say, a gummy degeneration and putrid fermentation of the tissues,\r\ncaused by the abundance of manure in the soil and the excess of water in\r\nthe plant at a time when it is subject to sudden changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n\"This disease is not confined to cauliflowers; it is common in all\r\ngarden vegetables, and is of the same nature as that which attacks\r\ntomatoes and which was described by this author in the same journal in\r\n1884.\" [This disease is also mentioned by Victor Paquet, in his \"Plantes\r\nPotagers\" (London, 1846, p. 243), where it is attributed to stagnant\r\nmoisture].\r\n\r\n[C] _Country Gentleman_, 1889, p. 769, (from the _Port Jefferson Times_,\r\nSept. 27):\r\n\r\n\"Close upon the heels of a partial failure of the potato crop through\r\nrotting comes the news from various points on Eastern Long Island that\r\nthe cauliflower crop has almost totally failed through the same cause.\r\nIn Manorville the crop has not sufficiently developed in some of the\r\nfields to warrant picking, and in Mattituck and east of that place the\r\nrotting will result in an almost total loss. In a few cases there is not\r\nyet any indication of rot, but the farmers are afraid to tie the plants\r\nup lest rotting ensue.\r\n\r\n\"In East Moriches, Orient, and the near vicinity, the yield will not be\r\nof sufficient value to pay for plowing the ground, not to speak of the\r\nother expenses which have been entailed. Through the Hamptons careful\r\nobservations failed to reveal scarcely a single successful crop.\r\n\r\n\"Last Saturday Henry T. Osborn, of East Moriches, tied up 2,000 heads\r\nand on Monday he cut enough to fill 30 barrels. He let them lie in his\r\nbarn over night, and the next day not a barrel of them was fit for\r\nshipment to market.\r\n\r\n\"George Cooper, of Mattituck, planted seven acres of cauliflower which\r\nhe thinks will prove a total loss. And so on the reports come from many\r\nEast End farmers. The recent heavy rains are generally assigned as the\r\ncause of the failure.\"\r\n\r\n[D] A series of articles upon \"damping off\" may be found in the\r\n_American Garden_ for 1889, pp. 347-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith no vegetable is it more important to have good seed than with the\r\ncauliflower, and in none is there a greater tendency to deteriorate. On\r\nthis account less dependence is to be placed upon named varieties than\r\nin some other cultivated plants, and greater need is required to secure\r\ncarefully selected strains. Owing to peculiarities of soil, climate and\r\nseason, and the different degrees of care given by the different\r\ngrowers, seeds of the same variety may be better from one source than\r\nfrom another. On this account, when a variety is found adapted to one's\r\nneeds it is well to use the same variety, and obtain it from the same\r\nsource year after year.\r\n\r\nCauliflower seed is mostly grown in Europe, chiefly in Holland and\r\nGermany, to some extent in Italy and France, and less in England. One\r\nvariety, the Large Asiatic, seeds abundantly in Northern India. There\r\nare a few localities where the seed is successfully grown in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the dwarf early varieties are chiefly grown in the north, and\r\nthe large late varieties at the south. In the south the seed is most\r\neasily grown, and southern seed brings the lowest price.\r\n\r\nMcIntosh states that cauliflower seed seldom ripens in Scotland. In\r\nEngland, as I have said, it is grown to a limited extent, but not so\r\nmuch as that of broccoli. The seed plants are there selected in June, at\r\nthe time of heading, and allowed to stand until the seed matures. Mr.\r\nDean states that his Early Snowball produces in warm, early seasons\r\nbetter seed in England than anywhere else. Loudon, in his \"Encyclopædia\r\nof Gardening\" (5th Ed., 1827) quotes Neill, as saying that \"Until the\r\ntime of the French Revolution, quantities of English cauliflower were\r\nregularly sent to Holland and the low countries, and even France\r\ndepended on us for cauliflower seed. Even now English seed is preferred\r\nto any other.\"\r\n\r\nA later English writer states that the English prefer Dutch seed and the\r\nDutch English seed.\r\n\r\nMost of the seed now used in England, as well as nearly all of that sold\r\nin this country comes from Holland, France and Germany. The climate,\r\nespecially of Holland and North Germany, is particularly favorable for\r\nthe production of fine strains of seed, especially of the dwarf early\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nMcIntosh (\"Book of the Garden,\" 1855, Vol. II, p. 116) says: \"Our best\r\ncauliflower seed is imported from Holland, and for its quality we have\r\nmuch greater reason to thank the better climate than the growers, who\r\nare not over particular in the matter, as Dutch cauliflower seed is sure\r\nto sell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean varieties are generally large, and require for the\r\nmost part too long a season to be popular and successful in this\r\ncountry. As dwarf varieties have been produced, the cultivation of this\r\nvegetable in Europe has extended farther north. As already stated, when\r\nthe cauliflower was first cultivated in France the island of Cyprus was\r\nthe only place where it was known to seed, and for a time the plant was\r\nknown in England under the name of Cyprus Colewort.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the seed used in the United States is still imported,\r\nAmerican grown seed appears to give good satisfaction and is moderate in\r\nprice. Professor W. J. Green, of the Ohio experiment station, who tested\r\nPuget Sound seed in 1889, reported as follows: \"The most remarkable\r\nexamples [of the superiority of Northern grown seed] are found in the\r\nPuget Sound cabbage and cauliflower seed, which show great vitality and\r\nconsequent vigor in growth of plant. We have received numerous samples\r\ngrown in that region by H. A. March and A. G. Tillinghast, brother of\r\nIsaac Tillinghast, the seedsman. These seeds were very large, full of\r\nvitality, and the plants uncommonly vigorous. At transplanting time the\r\nplants were nearly twice the height of others of the same variety, while\r\nthe difference in color was very marked. This robust habit continued to\r\nmanifest itself during a greater part of the season, but as maturity\r\napproached, the variation was less and less marked, until at last the\r\nothers had caught up, and there was no perceptible difference.\" No\r\nchange in time of maturity or habit of growth was noticed.\r\n\r\nMr. Brill, of Long Island, states that to secure seed there it is best\r\nto winter over the partially headed plants in a cold frame or cellar,\r\nand set them out early in the spring. The summers are so warm there,\r\nhowever, that except in particularly favorable seasons but little seed\r\nforms. Several excellent early varieties have originated on Long Island,\r\nand there is reason to believe that hot, changeable climates, though\r\nunprofitable for the growing of seed, are particularly favorable for the\r\nproduction and maintenance of early sorts able to head in hot weather.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps for this reason that England, Denmark, and Central Germany\r\nhave produced more early varieties than Holland, France and Italy. The\r\ndry calcareous soil of some parts of England appears to be particularly\r\nfavorable to the production of early varieties.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Boston, cauliflower seed has been grown to some\r\nextent, especially the variety known as Boston Market, which was\r\nformerly very popular there. James J. H. Gregory writes me under date\r\nof March 3d, 1891, that he raised 60 pounds of seed of the Boston Market\r\nfrom 500 plants, where from the same number of plants of the Snowball\r\nand Extra Early Erfurt, grown under precisely the same conditions, he\r\nobtained less than a great spoonful. The seed was raised on an island\r\nused expressly for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom in England and Holland, where the season is too short for\r\nthe seed to ripen perfectly, to diminish the number of seed-stalks on a\r\nplant by cutting out the centre of the head. The flower-stalks require\r\nto be supported by stakes, and when the seed is nearly mature, to be\r\nguarded from birds. A plaster cat is recommended as a good scare-crow,\r\nespecially if its position is changed every few days, so that the birds\r\nwill continue to think that it is alive.\r\n\r\nCauliflower seed, as is well known, is smaller and inferior in\r\nappearance to cabbage seed, and always contains a considerable\r\nproportion, which is shrunken and worthless. This poor seed is removed\r\nfrom the crop as much as possible before it is sold. This shrunken\r\ncondition arises from the fact that a large share of the flowers fail to\r\nset, and many of the pods only partly fill. Shrunken seed is no\r\nindication of inferiority of variety, in fact rather otherwise, for the\r\nmost compact heads, being the most deformed from a structural point of\r\nview, give the least amount of good seed. Still, it is not necessarily\r\ntrue that the highest priced seed is always the best and most economical\r\nto use. A new variety, until it becomes well established, requires rigid\r\nselection, and this so reduces the amount produced that a high price can\r\nbe obtained for all that is grown. An older variety, on the other hand,\r\nwhich has become so well established, and comes so true that nearly\r\nevery head is perfect and will furnish good seed, can be supplied at a\r\ncheaper rate and may for a given purpose be equally good. As a rule it\r\nmay be said that the newest and highest priced seeds are too expensive\r\nto use on a large scale, and the cheapest seeds are inferior in quality.\r\nOne should not judge of the value of a variety wholly by the price at\r\nwhich its seed is sold. Most of the high priced varieties are dwarf\r\nkinds, which are becoming more and more popular in this country, but\r\nwhich produce comparatively little seed.\r\n\r\nOur varieties of cauliflowers have all been developed by means of\r\nselection. Desirable features have either been acquired by gradual\r\nselection through successive generations in a given locality; or some\r\nsudden variation has been preserved and perpetuated. Climate, as already\r\nstated, has had much to do in developing certain peculiarities. The\r\nvarieties of Italy, France, Holland and Germany have in each case\r\ncertain features common among themselves which can only be accounted for\r\nby the influence of the particular climate in which they are grown. It\r\nis, therefore, useless to attempt to maintain these characters wholly\r\nunchanged in other climates. Hardiness, earliness, certainty of heading,\r\nprotection of the head by leaves, and shortness of stem, can all be\r\nincreased by selection, but, as they are all likewise influenced by\r\nclimate, the selection is more effective in some climates than in\r\nothers. The varieties of the south of Europe are as a whole\r\ncharacterized by a long period of growth, tall stems, great vigor and\r\nhardiness, and by having the leaves inclined to grow upright and protect\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower crosses readily with the cabbage and other varieties and\r\nspecies of the genus Brassica. It does not usually flower at the same\r\ntime, however, as other members of the genus, so the difficulty is not\r\nusually great in keeping it pure.\r\n\r\nIn France the cauliflower has been crossed artificially with cabbage,\r\nturnip and rutabaga, in the attempt to obtain varieties of greater\r\nhardiness. Numerous peculiar forms were the result of these crosses,\r\nsome of which were good cauliflowers, said to be of increased hardiness,\r\nbut none of them have found their way into general cultivation. One of\r\nthese, owing to a cross with the turnip, acquired the flavor of that\r\nvegetable. A full account of these crosses may be found in the _Revue\r\nHorticole_ for 1880.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, by Mr. A. Dean, of England, on a case of apparent\r\ncrossing in the cabbage tribe will be read with interest:\r\n\r\n\"A very pretty conical-headed plant of a Colewort was allowed to run to\r\nseed, but nothing else of the same family was known to be in flower for\r\na distance of at least several hundred yards. The produce was saved and\r\nsown, and has been furnishing food for the table during the past winter,\r\nbut what a progeny! Some were reproductions of the seed parent, but\r\nlarger, and proved very handsome early cabbages; others were very fair\r\nColeworts; others bad examples of Cottager's Purple Kale, others Green\r\nKale, while others resembled sprouting Broccoli, both green and purple.\r\nOne plant was an example of the once popular Dalmany sprouts, and there\r\nwere many other plants that admitted of no classification. It is\r\nprobable that bees, which travel long distances, had somewhere found\r\nsome sprouting in Broccoli flower and had brought pollen from those to\r\nthe Colewort plant in question.\"\r\n\r\nSpontaneous variation has given a number of curious forms of\r\ncauliflower, including one with several heads in the place of one, and\r\nanother in which the head is flattened sidewise, like the garden\r\ncockscomb. These forms have not been cultivated.\r\n\r\nCauliflower seed contains on an average about 7,000 seeds to the ounce,\r\nof which about one-half usually germinate, a much smaller per cent. than\r\nin cabbage. Long Island growers estimate two ounces of seed to the acre\r\nas a safe amount for the small varieties and an ounce and a half for the\r\nlate varieties.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a common belief, especially in England, that old seed\r\nwould be most likely to produce good heads. There is little evidence to\r\nsupport this belief, and just as little ground for the more recent\r\nbelief held by some that old seed is particularly liable to produce\r\nloose worthless heads. Like all other seed cauliflower seed ought to be\r\nas fresh as possible; fresh seed always germinates best and gives the\r\nmost vigorous plants. Seed two or three years old, however, is generally\r\nsatisfactory, and it will often grow successfully at double that age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CAULIFLOWER SEED GROWING ON PUGET SOUND.\"\r\n\r\nBy H. A. March, Fidalgo Island, Puget Sound, Washington, in _Rural New\r\nYorker_, 1888.\r\n\r\n\"I am told by very good authority that cauliflower seeds had never been\r\ngrown in the United States as a field crop to any extent until we made a\r\nsuccess of it here on Puget Sound. In the first place a very cool,\r\nmoist climate is necessary to cure [secure] seeds at all. That climate\r\nwe have here on our low flat islands lying in the mouth of the Gulf of\r\nGeorgia. We often have heavy fogs in the night, and always dews equal to\r\na light shower every night all summer long. The first expense attending\r\nthe raising of cauliflower seed is quite heavy. The soil must be a rich,\r\nwarm loam facing the south, and it will be all the better for having a\r\nclay subsoil. We must have the land underdrained once in twenty feet,\r\nthe drains being three feet deep, to give us a chance to work early in\r\nthe spring, and also to take off the surplus water when we come to flood\r\nthe land in July.\r\n\r\n\"To prepare the land for the crop we start in September. After the fall\r\nrains have softened the soil, plow, harrow, roll, harrow again, then\r\nreplow and work it again, until the soil is as fine as an onion bed. Now\r\nwe throw it into ridges, six feet apart, and it is ready for work in\r\nearly spring. For manure we sow 2,000 pounds of superphosphate and\r\nground Sitka herring, equal parts of each, to the acre. With two horses\r\nand a Planet, Jr., cultivator we work the ridges until they are nearly\r\nlevel. By using two horses we straddle the ridge, and save tramping it\r\nwhere our plants are to go.\r\n\r\n\"To get the plants, we sow the seeds about September 1, in rather poor\r\nsoil, giving them plenty of room; the rows being a foot apart and the\r\nseeds sown thinly in the rows. This gives us stocky and hardy plants,\r\nwhich, we think, are less liable to damp off when transplanted. About\r\nNovember 1 we transplant the plants into cold frames, six inches apart\r\neach way, as we wish to keep them growing a little all winter. The\r\nglasses are kept on at night and through heavy rains. In case of a cold\r\nsnap, we cover the glasses with mats; but that is not often necessary,\r\nfor we seldom have a temperature colder than 16° above zero. Everything\r\ndepends on good plants and an early start in the spring, for we raise\r\ntwo crops the same season, and an early frost on our unripe seed is sure\r\nto ruin the crop. Now, to set the plants out and make them grow from the\r\nstart, a line is stretched along one of these flat ridges, a boy goes\r\nalong, and with a three-foot marker marks the spots for the plants; a\r\nman follows with a hoe and makes a hole, about the size of a quart dish,\r\nto receive each plant. During the winter we have gathered up 200 or 300\r\ntomato and oyster cans, melted off the tops and bottoms, leaving tubes\r\nabout five inches long by three or four across. Now, armed with a light\r\nwheelbarrow with a wooden tray, containing from 50 to 75 of these cans,\r\nwe go to the cold-frame (having well soaked it with water the night\r\nbefore); take a can, set it right down over the plant; press the can\r\ninto the soil about two inches, and, with a light shove to one side,\r\nlift the plant without disturbing the roots; fill our tray and start for\r\nthe field; run the barrow between two rows and set a can and plant in\r\neach of the holes just made. A boy follows with a watering pot\r\ncontaining _warm_ water, and pours a gill into each tube, which softens\r\nthe soil so that the tubes can be lifted right out, leaving the plant\r\nstanding in the hole. We brush a little dirt around the plant, and firm\r\nit with the blade of the hoe.\r\n\r\n\"Now we have our plants set, and not one ever wilts in the hottest\r\nspring day. In two or three days the cultivator is started and kept a\r\ngoing once a week until the heads begin to form. We hand-hoe three or\r\nfour times, besides fighting insects. The cabbage maggot is our worst\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\"When the flowers commence to bloom out or form heads, is the most\r\nparticular time. A man who thoroughly understands what a perfect\r\ncauliflower is, must now go through the field every two or three days\r\nand examine every head, and if there is any sign of its growing in\r\nquarters, or if a leaf is growing through the head, or if there is any\r\nlooseness in its growth, the heads are staked and cut for market. For,\r\nas like produces like, it will never do to get seed from an inferior\r\nhead, especially in the case of cauliflowers; for the seeds from these\r\nare more apt to run wild than any seed I ever grew. We usually set a\r\nFottler cabbage in the place from which the poor plant has been cut, and\r\nit makes a fine head by fall.\r\n\r\n\"By the middle of June we have the field clear of all inferior heads,\r\nand their places filled with late cabbages. About this time all the\r\nheads saved for seed are 'sponging out' preparing to throw their\r\nseed-stalks. Now is our time to help them. On the upper side of the\r\nfield, we have wooden water tanks, each holding about 20,000 gallons of\r\n_warm_ water. The water is run into the tanks in the middle of the day\r\nthrough flat open troughs, which heat it up to about 70° Fah. It is\r\ntaken through canvas hose over the field, and the soil is soaked to the\r\nsubsoil. Now our underdrains come into play, for all of the surplus\r\nwater is drained off in about three days, and we can start the\r\ncultivator. We cultivate close up to the plants. If we break the leaves\r\noff it doesn't matter, for they fall off anyway as soon as the seed\r\nstalks start. This watering gives the plants new life and they start off\r\nfor a second crop, or become biennials the first year. The watering and\r\ncultivation are kept up once in 10 days until the seed-stalks are so\r\nlarge that they cannot be run through without breaking the plants. The\r\nseed ripens from the middle of September to the last of October,\r\naccording to how good a start was made in the spring.\r\n\r\n\"The expense and trouble are not over yet. The seed is ripening about\r\nthe time our rainy season sets in, and we don't see the sun once a week\r\non an average, so that our seed must all be dried by fire heat. Our\r\ndry-houses are 30 x 20 feet, and 18 feet high with 2 x 6 inch joists\r\nrunning across the houses in tiers, on which we hang the seeds for\r\ndrying. A brick furnace is built in the middle of the house, with the\r\nflue running through the roof.\r\n\r\n\"We usually make three cuttings. As soon as the pods on the center\r\nstalks begin to turn yellow, and the seed a light brown, we make our\r\nfirst cutting. From one to three plants are put in a pile and tied with\r\nbinding twine. The bundles are taken to the dry-house on wheelbarrows,\r\nmade with racks on purpose for carrying the seeds. A cloth is spread\r\nover the rack to catch any shelling seeds. A man carries about 100\r\nbunches at a load and passes them up to a man in the house who hangs\r\nthem on nails driven for the purpose. The seed is allowed to hang a few\r\ndays to thoroughly ripen before firing up. We aim to keep the heat in\r\nthe top of the house at about 80° until the seed and stalks are dry.\r\n\r\n\"The bundles are now taken down and laid upon a cloth where they are\r\ncrushed by walking on them. Grain sacks are then filled with the stalks\r\nand pods as full as they will tie up, and the contents are thrashed in\r\nthe sacks with a flail. The seed is then sifted from the stalks and\r\ntaken to the fanning-mill, and after putting it through the mill two or\r\nthree times, we set the boys to rolling it. For this purpose we have a\r\nboard two and a half feet long by one foot wide, with thin strips nailed\r\non the sides to keep the seeds from rolling off. A boy sits down on a\r\ncloth with a pan of seed by his side, and holds one end of the board in\r\nhis lap, while the other end rests on the cloth. He puts a handful of\r\nseed on the top end of the board and gently shakes it. All of the sound\r\nplump seeds run off on to the cloth, while the shriveled seeds, bits of\r\nstalk, dirt, weed seeds, etc., remain on the board. A smart Indian boy\r\nwill clean ten pounds a day, at a cost of 50 cents and his board. Now\r\nthe seed is sacked in double cotton sacks, holding about ten pounds\r\neach, and is ready for market.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent paper the same writer said, in answer to inquiries upon\r\nthe subject, that the cauliflower and cabbage readily mixed, but that\r\nthere was little danger of their doing so in his locality, as the\r\ncabbage was nearly out of flower before the cauliflower began to\r\nblossom. To make the matter certain, however, boys were sent to every\r\nneighboring cabbage patch to clip off all straggling late blossoms that\r\nremained. Only one variety of cauliflower, or strains of one variety,\r\nis grown by him for seed in any one year.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the same writer explains itself:\r\n\r\n \"FIDALGO, Washington, April 3, 1891.\r\n\r\n \"MR. A. A. CROZIER, Ann Arbor, Mich.\r\n\r\n\"_Dear Sir_:--Your letter of inquiry received. In answer would say, I am\r\nthe original cauliflower raiser in the Puget Sound country. In 1882 I\r\ndiscovered that by wintering the plants over in cold-frame, and keeping\r\nthem growing all winter, those that were transplanted _without wilting_\r\nwould form heads, and then throw seed-stalks in time to form seed before\r\nfrost, if they were continually wet with tepid water after heading. The\r\nfirst seed that was put on the market was sold by Francis Brill,\r\nRiverhead, L. I. Since then I have furnished some of the largest firms\r\nin the country with seed, and the seed has given perfect satisfaction.\r\nThere is a secret in raising good seed that I don't care to give away.\r\nSeveral of my neighbors have tried to raise the seed, and I believe some\r\nof it has been put on the market, but it has proved inferior for the\r\nwant of skill in knowing _which heads_ to seed from, as all heads will\r\nnot do to seed from, even though they may appear perfect to an\r\ninexperienced eye. It's skilled labor that produces No. 1 seed.\r\n\r\n\"I enclose you my circular, with reports from growers and dealers, also\r\nquite a few from the experiment stations. I have a large number that I\r\nhave not printed, as they came too late for this year. The business has\r\ngrown from a few pounds in 1882 to nearly 300 pounds in 1890. I think in\r\nthe near future, that Puget Sound will grow all of the cauliflower seed\r\nthat will be grown in the country. Cabbage seed is also grown to a large\r\nextent. I raised about two tons last year, and there probably will be\r\nten tons raised on Puget Sound the coming summer.\r\n\r\n\"Cabbage and cauliflower are grown to a considerable extent both in\r\nOregon and Washington, though California sends our first to this market.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me for an account of my Early Perfection or \"No. 9.\" It was a\r\n_sport_ or a \"stray seed,\" found among some Erfurt Earliest Dwarf\r\nimported seed, and being the first in the field to form a head by over a\r\nweek, I naturally saved it for \"stock seed,\" and as it propagated itself\r\nperfectly, and was perfection itself, I named it Early Perfection. I am\r\nnot aware of another by the name of Perfection on the market--never saw\r\nit in the seedmen's catalogues. Early Padilla and Early Long Island\r\nBeauty, by Brill, are the same; they originated with me, are a selection\r\nfrom _Erfurt Large_, and are _early_ and _large_.\r\n\r\n\"All of Tillinghast's Puget Sound cauliflower seed has been grown by me.\r\nI have also grown all that Francis Brill has put on the market.\r\n\r\n\"D. M. Ferry & Co.'s Early Puritan originated with me, from a sport of\r\nHenderson's Snowball. I sold them the stock for two years.\r\n\r\n \"Yours Truly,\r\n\r\n H. A. MARCH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe varieties of cauliflower differ among themselves less than those of\r\nmost other vegetables, and their characters are less firmly fixed. Their\r\ntendency to degenerate, especially under unfavorable conditions, and the\r\nreadiness with which they may be improved by selection, has given rise\r\nwithin recent years to numerous so called varieties, some of them but\r\nslightly differing from those from which they originated. These have\r\nfrequently received the names of the seedsmen who first sent them out.\r\nMany of these seedmen's varieties have dropped out of cultivation, as\r\nwell as other varieties which have appeared from time to time, but which\r\nhave not possessed sufficient distinctive merit. Some varieties, from\r\nnot having been kept up to their original standard, have reverted to\r\nthose from which they sprang, or become so like them that their names\r\nhave come to be regarded as synonyms.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all such names have been brought together in the following\r\ncatalogue, and all the obtainable information given concerning the\r\nvarieties which they represent. The testimony given is sometimes\r\ncontradictory, either from want of proper observation on the part of\r\nthe writers quoted, or from differences in the seeds sold under the same\r\nname. This is necessarily somewhat confusing to one who is looking up\r\nthe merits of a variety, but it will form a better basis for judgment\r\nthan would a mere descriptive list, without reference to dates or\r\nauthorities. It is practically impossible to make a satisfactory\r\nclassification which will include all the varieties, and they have\r\ntherefore been arranged here in alphabetical order, as being most\r\nconvenient for reference. Nearly all of the most popular varieties have,\r\nhowever, characters sufficiently distinct so that they can be easily\r\nrecognized. Some have short stems, others long; some are early, others\r\nlate; some have upright leaves, others drooping; their color varies from\r\ngrassy to bluish green; the heads vary from snow-white to cream-colored,\r\nand in two or three varieties classed with the cauliflowers they are\r\nreddish or purple, as in some of the broccolis. The form of the head\r\nvaries from flat to conical.\r\n\r\nMost of our varieties have come from a few stocks whose characters, as\r\nwell as those of their descendants, seem to have been largely determined\r\nby the locality in which they originated or have long been grown. The\r\nAlgiers, Paris and Erfurt groups are examples. In each of these groups\r\nthere is a series of varieties, differing mainly in size and earliness.\r\nIn the Erfurt group the production of early varieties has been carried\r\nfarthest, owing doubtless to the character of the climate, as well as\r\nthe greater skill employed in their selection. The early varieties,\r\nparticularly of this group, are characterized by having comparatively\r\nsmall, narrow and upright leaves, and a rather short stem. A partial\r\nlist of varieties, arranged in the order of earliness, follows the\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nADVANCE, see _Laing's Early Advance_.\r\n\r\nALABASTER.--Introduced to the general public by Johnson Stokes\r\nin 1890. In their catalogue for that year these seedsmen say: \"Our\r\n_Early Alabaster_ was originally a sport from the finest German strain\r\nof the selected Dwarf Erfurt, one extra fine head appearing some ten\r\ndays in advance of any other in the crop of one of the largest and most\r\nexpert cauliflower growers on Long Island in 1881. The seed of this was\r\ncarefully saved by him, and from it our stock has been brought up.\"\r\n\r\nThe seed of this variety has all been grown on Long Island, and it was\r\nall taken by Long Island gardeners until 1889, at which time there were\r\nsaid to be hundreds of acres of it in cultivation in Suffolk County,\r\nwhere it originated. [See Frontispiece.]\r\n\r\nALGIERS, (Probably includes _Large Algiers_ and _Large Late\r\nAlgiers_).--Vilmorin, in 1883, described Algiers as follows: \"Extremely\r\nvigorous, stronger and better developed than the Giant Naples, [Veitch's\r\nAutumn Giant]; leaves very large, undulate, almost curly, of a very deep\r\nand reflective glaucous green; stem large and strong, rather tall; head\r\nremarkably large, fine and white. In habit of growth it approaches the\r\nHalf Early Paris, but in time of maturity it agrees with the varieties\r\nof Holland and England. It is especially adapted to open-air culture in\r\na warm climate.\"\r\n\r\nM. May, of France, placed it in 1880 just before Giant Naples in\r\nmaturity, with a little shorter stem and little less ample foliage. He\r\nsaid: \"Late, but of gigantic size; leaves large, long and numerous, of a\r\nglaucous green, and surrounding well the head, which becomes as large as\r\nthose of our native varieties, and is snow-white and exceedingly fine.\r\nSpecially suited to warm climates. In our country it may be sown in\r\nSeptember, and gathered the following August.\"\r\n\r\nRawson, a seedsman of New York, said in 1886: \"A large and very popular\r\nlate variety, and one of the very best for the market. This variety is\r\nlargely grown for the New York market. It is one of the largest in\r\ncultivation, and always sure to head.\" Frotzer, of New Orleans,\r\ndescribes it as a French variety of the same season as Lenormand\r\nShort-stem, but a surer producer, having taken the place there of other\r\nsecond-early kinds since its introduction. At the Ohio experiment\r\nstation it proved unsuited to the climate. A writer in the _American\r\nAgriculturist_ for 1889 stated that this variety was formerly largely\r\ngrown in Suffolk County, Long Island, but that for the past two or three\r\nseasons it had done poorly, and would not be grown in the future. Its\r\nlarge size required the plants to be set four feet apart.\r\n\r\nALLEAUME (_Early Alleaume_, _Dwarf Alleaume_).--This variety,\r\noriginated by an intelligent market gardener of Paris; was, according to\r\nthe originator, one of the best for cultivation under frames. Cultivated\r\nthere in the open ground, that is to say, sown in June and planted out\r\nin July, it has given remarkably good results. It is a little below\r\nmedium height, and has a very short stem. Its oblong leaves are of a\r\nlight grayish green. The head is of medium size, very white, fine\r\ngrained, of first quality, and early. It is a variety of great promise.\r\nThis is the statement of the editor of _Revue Horticole_ in 1884. In\r\n1888, Mr. Sutton, of England, calls it a distinct, dwarf, compact,\r\nFrench variety, having creamy-white heads, and coming in after Sutton's\r\nFavorite. In 1890, Vilmorin quotes it as a very early dwarf,\r\nshort-stemmed variety, especially good for forcing.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, W. A. Burpee offered an \"Extra Early Alleaume,\" which he\r\ndescribed as \"stem very short, leaves long, _entire_ or _very little\r\nlobated_, of a grayish-green color, forming a close protection to the\r\nhead, which is large, fine grained and pure white.\" This is probably the\r\nsame variety as above.\r\n\r\nALMA (_Waite's Alma_).--Hackett sells this as a new English\r\nvariety of large size, firm, and surpassing in excellence the Walcheren.\r\nThere was, however, a variety named Alma, probably the same, growing at\r\nParis in 1857 (see _Jour. Cent. Soc. Hort. France_, 1857, p. 422). In\r\n1865 Waite's Alma was considered by some to be merely the Early London,\r\nand by others to be the same as Walcheren; at least, seeds of these two\r\nvarieties had been sent out for it.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN.--Seed of a very early variety bearing this name was\r\nsent by William Ingell, of Oswego County, New York, to the editor of the\r\n_Country Gentleman_, in 1861. Mr. Ingell, who named the variety, does\r\nnot state whether he grew the seed or not. In 1889, Bailey's \"Annals of\r\nHorticulture\" contained the name \"American,\" with _American Beauty_ as\r\nsynonym.\r\n\r\nANCIENT LENORMAND, see _Lenormand_.\r\n\r\nASIATIC (_Early Asiatic_, _Large Asiatic_, _Large Late\r\nAsiatic_, _Dur d'Angleterre_).--These seem to be substantially one\r\nvariety, the terms \"early\" and \"late\" being in this, as in some other\r\ncases, applied by different seedsmen to the same variety, when, as in\r\nthis case, it is of intermediate season. Since the introduction of such\r\nextremely early sorts as the Extra Early Erfurt, this and other\r\nmid-season varieties are more often called \"late.\" The Asiatic seems to\r\nhave originated from the Early London, of which it is regarded as merely\r\na stronger growing and later variety. The first mention I find of it is\r\nin _Hovey's Magazine_, in 1845, where Large Asiatic and Walcheren are\r\ncalled the two most noted varieties. In 1849 the same magazine states\r\nthat it was sent out by the London Horticultural Society. In 1850 a\r\nwriter in the _Gardener's Chronicle_ mentions this and Walcheren as his\r\ntwo favorite varieties. In 1854, J. D. Browne describes the Large, Late\r\nAsiatic in the report of the United States Department of Agriculture as\r\nlarger and taller than Early London.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 this variety is mentioned in the American edition of \"Neill's\r\nGardener's Companion\" as having recently come much into use. As this\r\nedition was taken from the fourth Edinburgh edition, the actual date\r\nhere referred to was probably much earlier. Three other varieties,\r\nscarcely differing in character, are mentioned--the Early, Late and\r\nReddish-stalked. The Large Asiatic is now extensively grown in Northern\r\nIndia, where it seeds freely, but has a short season, and is not\r\nconsidered as delicate or fine in flavor as the ordinary English\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nAUTUMN GIANT, see _Veitch's Autumn Giant_.\r\n\r\nBALTIC GIANT.--In Burpee's \"How to Grow Cabbages and\r\nCauliflowers\" (1888), Mr. J. Pedersen, of Denmark, gives the following\r\naccount of this variety: \"A new variety of large, late cauliflower,\r\noriginated in these northern regions, and which I propose to name Baltic\r\nGiant, is very hardy, of robust growth, and produces very large and\r\nsolid dazzling white flower-heads. A friend of mine writes from the\r\nBaltic island of Bornholm that in mild seasons he has left this splendid\r\nlate variety in the open ground as late as Christmas, only protected by\r\na leaf or two bent over the heads.\" The variety is being tested in this\r\ncountry by W. A. Burpee & Co.\r\n\r\nBERLIN DWARF.--Rawson says: \"In earliness, size and quality it\r\nresembles the Snowball.\" Gregory, in 1890, makes the same statement.\r\n\r\nBEST OF ALL.--An early variety mentioned in _Gardening\r\nIllustrated_, 1885, p. 438.\r\n\r\nBLACK SICILY (_Large Black_, _Dwarf Early Violet\r\nBroccoli_).--Vilmorin says: \"In growth and appearance this variety\r\nsomewhat resembles Algiers. Stem rather tall, leaves very large, broad\r\nand much crumpled, almost curly; differs from all other cauliflowers in\r\nthe color of its head, which is violet, and with a grain much coarser\r\nthan in other varieties, while it is sufficiently close, solid and\r\nlarge. Not very late; always grown in the open air, and ready to\r\ncommence cutting in September.\" Mentioned in _Bon Jardinier_, in 1859,\r\nas one of the three principal Broccolis, with which it is generally and\r\nproperly classed.\r\n\r\nBOSTON MARKET (_Improved Early Paris_).--This variety, which\r\nhas now gone out of existence, was formerly extensively cultivated\r\naround Boston, where it originated by continued selection from the Early\r\nParis. In the _American Journal of Horticulture_, for 1869, p. 92, is a\r\nfigure and description.\r\n\r\nBURPEE'S BEST EARLY.--An improved type of Dwarf Erfurt, named\r\nand introduced by W. A. Burpee & Co. in 1886, after, as they say,\r\nsixteen years selection by one grower. It is said to be of dwarf,\r\ncompact growth, with a short stalk, and large, solid, nearly globular\r\nheads, very early and certain to head.\r\n\r\nThe Dingee & Conrad Company sell the same variety.\r\n\r\nAt the Ohio experiment station in 1889, this variety was regarded as\r\nprobably the same as Large Erfurt, rather large, and a few days later\r\nthan Early [Extra Early] Erfurt, but quite as good in other respects. At\r\nthe Colorado station, in 1888, \"Burpee's Earliest\" was noted for its\r\nlarge leaves and white, compact heads. It headed ten days later than\r\nHenderson's Snowball.\r\n\r\nCARRARA ROCK.--An extra selected strain of Erfurt, said by Wm.\r\nElliott & Sons, of New York, to be the earliest and surest variety to\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nCARTER'S DEFIANCE (_Early Defiance_).--Gregory considers this a\r\nfine variety for forcing or very early use.\r\n\r\nCARTER'S DWARF MAMMOTH.--An early variety, coming in just after\r\nCarter's Defiance. Plant dwarf, head very large, perfect in form and of\r\nfine color.\r\n\r\nCARTER'S EXTRA EARLY AUTUMN GIANT.--A variety said, in 1889, to\r\nhave large, close, white heads, both flower and leaf being less coarse\r\nthan those of Autumn Giant.\r\n\r\nCARTER'S MT. BLANC, see _Mt. Blanc_.\r\n\r\nCHALON PERFECTION. A variety mentioned in _Gardener's Monthly_,\r\nin 1886. Said to be as white as snow, almost as smooth as ivory, and to\r\nmake good heads in soil of moderate fertility. Probably the same as\r\nEarly Dwarf Chalon, which see.\r\n\r\nCHAPEL (_Chapel's Cream_).--Catalogued in Bailey's \"Annals of\r\nHorticulture,\" in 1889.\r\n\r\nCLARK'S CHAMPION.--An imported English variety mentioned in\r\n_Vick's Magazine_ for 1887, p. 52, as being a little later than Snowball\r\nand Vick's Ideal.\r\n\r\nCYPRUS.--Said by Wolfner and Weisz, of Vienna, in 1888, to be a\r\nbeautiful early sort. It is an old Holland variety.\r\n\r\nDANISH SNOWBALL.--Offered by Vaughn, in 1891, who says he has\r\ntested it for two seasons, and finds it a good, extra early sort.\r\n\r\nDEAN'S EARLY SNOWBALL.--This, the oldest, and for a long time\r\nthe most popular of the Snowball varieties, has now been displaced in\r\nthis country by Henderson's Snowball and other early sorts. It is often\r\nsaid to be earlier than Early Dwarf Erfurt, but at the Chiswick trials,\r\nin 1876, it did not prove to be so. A writer in the _Garden_, for 1880,\r\nplaces it third on the list of early varieties, placing Carter's Extra\r\nEarly Defiance first, and Veitch's Extra Early second. It appears to be\r\nfully as dwarf as the earliest Erfurts, and to have a little larger\r\nhead. It has been said, even by the introducer, to be the English\r\nduplicate of the Early Dwarf Erfurt, but there is no doubt of its\r\ndistinctness from that variety, as was afterwards recognized. There was\r\nanother German variety, however, name not given, at the Chiswick trials\r\nreferred to, which was reported to be identical with Dean's Snowball.\r\nMr. Dean says: \"The Snowball may be told by one unfailing test, viz.:\r\nwhen the heads begin to burst into flower, they become suffused with a\r\npretty purple tint.\"\r\n\r\nThis variety was introduced into England in 1871, by Mr. A. Dean, from\r\nDenmark, where it was largely cultivated. It is still one of the best\r\nearly varieties, especially for hot weather and light soils. Mr. Dean\r\nstates that it is about the only variety of which seed can be grown in\r\nEngland, and he considers English-grown seed of this variety the best.\r\n\r\nDICKSON'S ECLIPSE, see _Eclipse_.\r\n\r\nDREER'S EARLIEST SNOWSTORM.--Henry A. Dreer, in 1890, says in\r\nhis catalogue: \"The earliest and best of all for forcing. It is dwarf,\r\nwith short outer leaves, and can be planted two feet apart each way;\r\nalways sure to make large, fine heads earlier than any other, and is the\r\nmarket-gardener's favorite. This variety must be kept growing\r\nconstantly, as it will not stand a check at any period of its growth.\"\r\nIn 1891, he writes that this variety is a strain of Extra Early Erfurt,\r\nthe seed of which is grown at Erfurt, Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the New York experiment station, in 1888, it produced heads fit for\r\nuse eighteen days later than Henderson's Early Snowball, and Earliest\r\nDwarf Erfurt.\r\n\r\nDWARF ERFURT (_Extra Early Erfurt_, _Early Dwarf Erfurt_,\r\n_Extra Early Dwarf Erfurt_).--These names all refer to practically the\r\nsame variety, which is usually sold in this country under the name of\r\nExtra Early Dwarf Erfurt, and is now the most popular early variety\r\ngrown. It is similar in habit to its parent, the Early Erfurt, but more\r\ndwarf, and the leaves smaller and more upright, allowing the plants to\r\nbe set closer together. The heads are close and well formed, but do not\r\nremain solid long, owing largely to the hot weather in which they are\r\ngenerally formed. The best seed comes from Erfurt, Germany, but as the\r\nvariety rapidly deteriorates, there is great difference between the\r\nselected and ordinary stocks.\r\n\r\nJohnson & Stokes say, in their catalogue for 1890, that their extra\r\nselected Early Dwarf Erfurt is distinct from the Early Dwarf Erfurt.\r\nBurpee calls his Extra Early Dwarf Erfurt \"the finest of all early\r\ncauliflowers.\" He, as well as some other seedsmen, sell different\r\nqualities, \"extra selected,\" \"true,\" numbers \"one\" and \"two,\" etc.\r\nFrench-grown seed sells for about half the price of German seed.\r\n\r\nAt the Chiswick trials, in 1876, where all known varieties were grown,\r\nthe Early Dwarf Erfurt proved to be the earliest variety grown. It is\r\nbest grown as a summer variety, being rather tender for a late crop,\r\nthough sometimes used.\r\n\r\nM. May, in the _Revue Horticole_, for 1880, describes this variety as\r\nfollows: \"Early Dwarf Erfurt. Very early, with light-colored, short,\r\nupright, spoon-shaped leaves, which surround the head well, but do not\r\ncover it. The head is well rounded, very regular, of remarkable\r\nwhiteness, and very fine and close. It readily attains a diameter of\r\nfifteen to twenty centimeters [about five to seven inches]. This variety\r\nis especially adapted to forcing, as its small size permits it to be\r\nreadily cultivated under glass. The best times for sowing it appear to\r\nbe at the beginning of spring and the end of summer. One may also sow it\r\nin September to obtain a crop in April and May.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. Pedersen, of Denmark, speaks as follows of this variety in\r\nBurpee's work on \"Cabbages and Cauliflowers:\" \"The success with\r\ncauliflowers depends greatly upon the right choice of varieties. This\r\nyear, for instance, we have in this country suffered from drouth to an\r\nextent not known of for the last score of years, and yet I have seen a\r\nsurprisingly grand field of cauliflowers, of an improved strain of the\r\nEarly Dwarf Erfurt variety, grown in a stiff clayey soil, very dry in\r\nthe surface, not in the best state of cultivation, and without any\r\nartificial watering whatever. The roots of the plants were 'puddled'\r\nwhen planted out; that was all. I do not believe that seven per cent.,\r\nperhaps not five, of said field of thirty or forty thousand plants\r\nfailed to make fine, large, solid, beautifully white and typical heads.\r\nOther varieties have either utterly failed, or made stunted,\r\nimperfectly developed heads.\"\r\n\r\nAt the New York experiment station, in 1882, the Extra Early Dwarf\r\nErfurt was slightly earlier than the Early Dwarf Erfurt, and produced\r\ndouble the proportion of good heads.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio experiment station, in 1889, reported as follows: \"The\r\nvarieties or strains most highly recommended are Early Puritan, Early\r\nPadilla, Long Island Beauty, Early Sea Foam, Early Snowball and Vick's\r\nIdeal. These all appear to be nearly identical with Early [Extra Early]\r\nErfurt, and may be considered as strains of that variety.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Dwarf, or Extra Early, Erfurt has furnished a large share of the\r\nvarieties now popular in this country, the following list of Erfurt\r\nvarieties will be useful for reference. The first three are in the order\r\nof earliness; the others (descended from Dwarf Erfurt,) being\r\nalphabetical:\r\n\r\n Early Erfurt Mammoth.\r\n EARLY ERFURT.\r\n _Dwarf Erfurt._\r\n   Alabaster (Johnson & Stokes).\r\n   Berlin Dwarf.\r\n   Best Early (Burpee).\r\n   Carrara Rock.\r\n   Gilt Edge (Thorburn).\r\n   Ideal (Vick).\r\n   Imperial.\r\n   Lackawanna (Tillinghast).\r\n   La Crosse Favorite (Salzer).\r\n   Landreth's First.\r\n   Long Island Beauty (Brill).\r\n   Model (Northrup).\r\n   Padilla (Tillinghast).\r\n   Prize (Maule)?\r\n   Puritan (Ferry).\r\n   Sea Foam (Rawson).\r\n   Small-Leaved Erfurt.\r\n   Snowball (Faust).\r\n   Snowball (Henderson).\r\n   Snowball (Thorburn).\r\n   Snowstorm (Dreer).\r\n   Snowstorm (Pearce)?\r\n\r\nEARLY.--At the New York experiment station in 1888, a variety\r\ncalled \"Early,\" from the English Specialty & Novelty Seed Co., was the\r\nonly one among nine varieties which failed to head. The Early London\r\nWhite is sometimes known as \"Early.\"\r\n\r\nEARLY ALLEAUME, see _Alleaume_.\r\n\r\nEARLY DEFIANCE (Sutton), see _Carter's Early Defiance_.\r\n\r\nEARLY DUKE.--Mentioned as one of the best four early varieties\r\nfor Central France in the _Annales de la Société d' Horticulture de l'\r\nAllier_ for 1852. See Lefevre.\r\n\r\nEARLY DUTCH.--An old variety, described by Vilmorin as follows:\r\n\"A large hardy variety, suitable for field cultivation. Stem long and\r\nrather slender; leaves elongated, but very large, of a grayish green,\r\nsomewhat undulated. This is one of the varieties in which the side of\r\nthe leaf is bare at the base for a considerable distance. The head is\r\nhard and solid, yet very large. It is a half-late variety. In its\r\noriginal country it does better than the French varieties and it is\r\ncultivated on a grand scale around Leyden. Large quantities are shipped\r\nto England, where it is found in the London markets, together with\r\ncauliflowers from the coasts of France, and especially Great Britain.\r\nThe name Dwarf Holland, which is given to this variety in Germany, can\r\nonly be explained by comparison with other Holland varieties. In\r\ncomparison with the French varieties it is tall.\"\r\n\r\nEARLY DWARF CHALON.--Vilmorin catalogues this as \"new\" in 1889,\r\nand says: \"Stem very short, head rather large, grain white and very\r\nclose. Specially recommended for open air culture.\" See Chalon\r\nPerfection.\r\n\r\nEARLY DWARF FORCING (Sutton).--No description.\r\n\r\nEARLY DWARF SURPRISE.--An early variety from Vilmorin, which\r\nheaded well at the New York experiment station, in 1884.\r\n\r\nEARLY DWARF VIENNA.--Said by Wolfner and Weisz, of Vienna, to\r\nbe an old superior sort, still grown for the first and second crop.\r\n\r\nEARLY ERFURT (_Erfurt_, _Large Erfurt_, _Large Early White\r\nErfurt_, _Late Erfurt_).--This is still a popular variety, but less\r\nhardy and less valuable as a late sort than the improved varieties from\r\nthe south of Europe; and as an early sort it has been displaced by its\r\noffspring, the Extra Early Erfurt, and the newer varieties derived from\r\nthat. The heads of the Early Erfurt are large and fine-grained but more\r\ninclined to be open and leafy than those of Early Paris. It is a little\r\nearlier than that variety. Vilmorin describes the Early Erfurt as\r\nfollows: \"Very early, distinct, and valuable, but difficult to keep\r\npure. Below medium height; stem rather short; leaves oblong, entire,\r\nrounded, and slightly undulated; of a peculiar light grayish green,\r\nwhich, added to their form and their rather erect position, gives to the\r\nplant an appearance somewhat resembling that of the Sugar Loaf. Head\r\nvery white, fine grained, rapidly developed, but not inclined to remain\r\nlong solid.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Bon Jardinier_ mentions the Erfurt, in 1859, among the novelties as\r\nthe earliest variety then known, being two weeks earlier than Salomon\r\n(Early Paris) and very suitable for forcing on account of its straight,\r\nupright leaves and earliness.\r\n\r\nEARLY ERFURT MAMMOTH (_New Erfurt Dwarf Mammoth_ [Burr],\r\n_etc_).--F. Burr, in 1886, said: \"A recent sort with large, clear white\r\nflowers, of superior quality. The plants are low and close, and\r\ngenerally form a head, even in protracted dry and warm weather. It\r\nappears to be one of the few varieties adapted to the climate of this\r\ncountry.\" This form of Early Erfurt has not been kept distinct.\r\n\r\nEARLY FAVORITE.--A variety without description is sold under\r\nthis name by A. B. Cleveland & Co. See also Haskell's Favorite.\r\n\r\nEARLY GERMAN.--\"A new variety advertised in English\r\nCatalogues:\"--(_Mag. of Hort._, 1838, p. 50).\r\n\r\nEARLY LA CROSSE FAVORITE.--John A. Salzer offers this as\r\nearlier than Henderson's Early Snowball, and \"the earliest, finest,\r\nwhitest and most compact grown.\" At the Ohio experiment station in 1889\r\nit was apparently the same as the ordinary large Early Erfurt. Mr.\r\nSalzer writes me that it is a distinct type of his own originating from\r\nthe Early Erfurt.\r\n\r\nEARLY LEYDEN, see _Walcheren_.\r\n\r\nEARLY LONDON (_London Particular_, _Fitch's Early London_,\r\n_Early English_, _Large Late_.)--An old sort, still quite popular in\r\nboth the United States and England. Vigorous and hardy, with large,\r\nabundant, deep-green, undulated foliage; stem rather tall, but shorter\r\nthan that of Early Dutch; head well formed and somewhat conical.\r\nFormerly the main variety grown as an early crop about London, but there\r\nare now varieties much earlier.\r\n\r\nVilmorin regards it the same as Early Dutch, which is evidently an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nEARLY LONDON MARKET (Gregory), see _Early London_.\r\n\r\nEARLY LONDON WHITE (Sutton).--An early form of Early London,\r\ncultivated some twenty years ago, but now seldom heard of.\r\n\r\nEARLY PADILLA (_Long Island Beauty_).--The Early Padilla was\r\nnamed and sent out by Tillinghast in 1888, who says that it is a sport\r\nfrom Henderson's Snowball which originated on one of his seed farms on\r\nPadilla Bay, Puget Sound, in the State of Washington. Mr. H. A. March,\r\nof Fidalgo, Washington, who states that he grows all of Tillinghast's\r\nPuget Sound cauliflower seed, says that Early Padilla originated with\r\nhim from the Large Erfurt, and was named by him the \"American.\" It was\r\npublished at first under this name in one of his circulars. Seed of the\r\nsame was also supplied by him to Francis Brill, of Long Island, who\r\nnamed it and sold it as Long Island Beauty.\r\n\r\nAt the New York experiment station in 1888, the Early Padilla equaled in\r\nearliness Henderson's Snowball, and was slightly surpassed by Extra\r\nEarly Dwarf Erfurt, while the variety obtained as Long Island Beauty was\r\nthe earliest of the nine early varieties on trial. At the Ohio\r\nexperiment station in 1889, Long Island Beauty was called a very perfect\r\nstrain of Early [Extra Early] Erfurt.\r\n\r\nGregory said in 1890: \"Of the thirteen varieties of cauliflower raised\r\nin my experimental plot in 1888, every specimen of the Long Island\r\nBeauty made fine heads, and the heads averaged larger than any other\r\nsort. It is among the very earliest.... Mr. Brill calls it, 'absolutely\r\nand unequivocally the best cauliflower in the world.'\"\r\n\r\nEARLY PARIS (_Tendre de Paris_, _Salomon_, _Petit\r\nSalomon_).--An excellent sort, more largely grown for a fall crop in\r\nthis country in the past than any other variety. Intermediate in season\r\nbetween half Early Paris and the new Extra Early Paris. As grown by the\r\nwriter from seed obtained for several years of James Vick, the Early\r\nParis was later than Early Erfurt, but more certain to head, the heads\r\nmore globular, a little smaller, decidedly lighter in weight than those\r\nof that variety, of better quality, and almost entirely free from\r\nintermixed leaves. Sown about May 10, and set out the last of June, most\r\nof the plants formed their heads during October. As a summer variety it\r\nproduces better heads than the Early Erfurt, but is less inclined to\r\nhead early in the season.\r\n\r\nDescribed by Vilmorin as follows: \"Plant small, rather tall; leaves\r\ncomparatively narrow, nearly straight, a little deflexed at the\r\nextremity, and slightly wavy at the border; head of medium size, quickly\r\nformed, but remaining firm but a short time. This variety is\r\nparticularly suitable for the summer crop; sown in April or May it heads\r\nin August or September.\" In this country, when used as a fall crop, no\r\ncomplaint is made of the heads not remaining firm. Sown in May in the\r\nlatitude of New York it heads in September and October. M. May, of\r\nFrance, describes this variety as follows in the _Revue Horticole_ for\r\n1880: \"An early variety grown by gardeners in the outskirts of Paris. It\r\nhas nearly the appearance of the Half Early Paris, but is smaller, with\r\na little shorter leaves, which are more narrow and upright. It is sown\r\nin September, and Wintered over under hand glasses on a bank composed of\r\nmanure from an old hot-bed and exposed to the south. The crop is then\r\ngathered during May. It may also be sown in March and gathered in July.\"\r\n\r\nVictor Paquet, in his work on Vegetables (_Plantes Potagers_), published\r\nat Paris in 1846, gives a full account of cauliflower culture and says:\r\n\"We cultivate two distinct varieties, _tendre_ and _demi-dur_. The\r\nsub-varieties _gros_ and _petit_ Salomon are sorts of the _tendre_.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Frotzer, of New Orleans, catalogues the Extra Early and the Half\r\nEarly, but not the Early Paris.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, of Massachusetts, states that most of the seed sold in the\r\nUnited States as Early Paris is really the Half Early. In a recent\r\nletter he says: \"The Early or Half Early Paris is now about dead, the\r\nvarious strains of Extra Early Erfurt, such as Snowball, Sea Foam, etc.,\r\nhaving taking its place.\" D. M. Ferry & Co. sell a variety called \"Early\r\nParis or Nonpareil,\" the latter name having been first given by J. M.\r\nThorburn & Co. to the Half Early Paris. There is no doubt, however, of\r\nthe Early and Half Early Paris being two varieties. The former, which\r\nhas so long been a favorite in the Northern States may still be relied\r\nupon, though in many cases, as stated, it is being displaced by the\r\nExtra Early Paris, and particularly by the Extra Early Erfurt and\r\nvarieties derived from it.\r\n\r\nEARLY PICPUS.--Catalogued by Vilmorin in 1889 as a new early\r\nvariety with large white heads, good for field culture.\r\n\r\nEARLY PURITAN.--A little the earliest of four varieties at the\r\nNew York experiment station in 1889, the others being Early Erfurt,\r\nSnowball, and Vick's Ideal. At the Ohio station the same year it was\r\nconsidered to be a strain of Early [Extra Early] Erfurt and one of the\r\nbest of its class.\r\n\r\nD. M. Ferry & Co., the introducers of this variety write me as follows\r\nregarding its history: \"The Puritan cauliflower originated as the\r\nproduct of a particularly early, large-headed, and dwarf-growing plant\r\nfound in a large crop of Snowball during the summer of 1886. The seed\r\nfrom this plant was saved, and selections made from the product until a\r\nsufficient quantity was secured. It was first noticed and selected by\r\none of the largest cauliflower growers in this country, and great care\r\nwas taken in selecting and seeding the plant. It is purely American,\r\nboth in origin and growth.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the letter of H. A. March, on page 122, that this\r\nvariety originated with him from Henderson's Snowball, at Fidalgo,\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nEARLY SNOWBALL.--Under this name Dean's Early Snowball is\r\ngenerally known in England, and this is probably the variety often sold\r\nas Snowball in the past in this country. Henderson's Early Snowball is,\r\nhowever, now sold under that name by many seedsmen, and is the one sent\r\nout as Early Snowball by the United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nSeedsmen sometimes prefix their own name, to the variety or strain of\r\nSnowball which they sell. All varieties bearing this or similar names\r\nare, so far as known, of the Dwarf Erfurt group.\r\n\r\nEARLY WALCHEREN, see _Walcheren_.\r\n\r\nECLIPSE.--The first notice I find of this variety is in the\r\n_Gardener's Chronicle_ for 1877 (Vol. VIII), where it is mentioned as\r\nbeing sent out by Dickson Brown & Tait. It is similar to Veitch's Autumn\r\nGiant, but about three weeks earlier. It is said to be a fine variety,\r\nwith large heads, well protected by the leaves, and to stand drouth\r\nwell. At the Ohio experiment station in 1889, the heads were invariably\r\nloose and sprangled.\r\n\r\nERFURT, see _Early Erfurt_.--The Erfurt varieties are\r\ncharacterized by light pea-green color, and stiff, more or less upright\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nEXTRA EARLY ALLEAUME, see _Alleaume_.\r\n\r\nEXTRA EARLY DWARF FORCING.--Probably the _Dwarf Erfurt_.\r\n\r\nEXTRA EARLY ERFURT, see _Dwarf Erfurt_.\r\n\r\nEXTRA EARLY PARIS.--This variety is not described by Vilmorin\r\nin his _Plantes Potagers_, but it is probably the one given in his\r\ncatalogue under the name of \"Extra Earliest Paris (forcing).\" It is\r\ncatalogued by the leading American seedsmen without description.\r\n\r\nFAUST'S EARLIEST SNOWBALL.--H. G. Faust & Co., say in their\r\ncatalogue for 1890: \"Our Snowball cauliflower is undoubtedly the best in\r\ncultivation. It is the earliest grown, produces the finest snow-white\r\nheads, and its compact habit enables it to be planted closer together\r\nthan any other variety.\"\r\n\r\nFAVORITE, see _Early La Crosse Favorite_, _Haskel's Favorite_,\r\nand _Early Favorite_.\r\n\r\nFRANKFORT GIANT, see _Veitch's Autumn Giant_.\r\n\r\nFRENCH, see _Large White French_ and _Half Early French_.\r\n\r\nFRENCH IMPERIAL (Thorburn), see _Imperial_.\r\n\r\nFROGMORE EARLY FORCING.--An old variety, described by F. Burr,\r\nin 1866, as follows: \"Stem quite short, and plant of compact habit. The\r\nheads are large and close, and their color clear and delicate.\r\nRecommended as one of the best for forcing, as well as an excellent sort\r\nfor early culture.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1876, a writer in the _Country Gentleman's Magazine_ mentions it as\r\nthe earliest variety grown, to be followed by Early London. It is now,\r\nhowever, but little used.\r\n\r\nGERRY ISLAND.--A variety said by Gregory to be a very reliable\r\nheader, closely resembling Early Paris. At the Colorado experiment\r\nstation, in 1888, it failed to head.\r\n\r\nGIANT MALTA.--Said to be a large, fine variety, with beautiful\r\nwhite heads of excellent flavor. Though dwarf, it is late, requiring six\r\nmonths in which to develop.\r\n\r\nGIANT NAPLES.--Described as synonymous with Veitch's Autumn\r\nGiant, by Vilmorin, in 1883, but he now catalogues it as a separate\r\nvariety, similar to Veitch's Autumn Giant, but later. It is doubtless\r\nthe original, of which the Autumn Giant is a slightly improved form. M.\r\nMay said of Giant Naples, in 1880: \"Very similar to Algiers, a little\r\ntaller stem, and more fully developed foliage. Highly esteemed in Italy\r\nand Algeria. Requires the same culture as Algiers.\"\r\n\r\nGILT EDGE EARLY SNOWBALL (Thorburn).--This American variety was\r\nreported by the Pennsylvania experiment station in 1888, as having done\r\nwell and formed good heads, free from intermixed leaves, where nearly\r\nall other sorts failed. \"It is a superior selected strain of Early\r\nSnowball which originated on Long Island and is of the same type as the\r\nbest strain of imported Dwarf Erfurt.\"--(Johnson & Stokes, 1891).\r\n\r\nGRANGE'S AUTUMN.--A variety mentioned in the _Gardener's\r\nChronicle_, in 1870, as earlier and inferior to Veitch's Autumn Giant.\r\n\r\nHAAGE'S EARLY GERMAN.--Said by Wolfner and Weisz, of Vienna, to\r\nbe an excellent short-stemmed variety for the open ground.\r\n\r\nHAAGE'S DWARF.--Said by Wolfner and Weisz, of Vienna, to have\r\nlarge, compact heads, which keep long in good condition.\r\n\r\nHAAGE'S NEW DWARF EARLY.--\"The best for forcing.\"--(Frederick\r\nAdolph A. Haage, Jr., Erfurt, Germany, 1890).\r\n\r\nHALF EARLY FRENCH (Landreth, 1886).--Thorburn, in 1891,\r\ncatalogued Half Early Large French, and in previous years Half Early\r\nDwarf French.\r\n\r\nHALF EARLY GIANT ITALIAN.--A new variety catalogued without\r\ndescription by Vilmorin, Andrieux, & Co., in 1889.\r\n\r\nHALF EARLY LARGE WHITE FRENCH (Vilmorin, Andrieux & Co.)--No\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nHALF EARLY PARIS (_Demi-dur de Paris_, _Gros Salomon_,\r\n_Nonpareil_).--Valuable for a late crop in this country, and now the\r\nmost popular variety in the New Orleans market. Described by Vilmorin,\r\nof Paris, as follows: \"Plant medium; leaves rather large, of a deep,\r\nslightly glaucous green, surrounding the head well, and gradually\r\nreflexed from the base to the apex; border undulate and coarsely\r\ndentate, stem rather short and stout; head very white, large, and\r\nremaining solid a long time. Formerly the most extensively cultivated\r\nfor the Paris market, but now giving place to Lenormand Short-stem, and\r\nseveral new varieties.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Revue Horticole_ for 1880, M. May says: \"This is the variety\r\nmost cultivated around Paris, because it is suited to all seasons. It\r\nmay be sown: (1) In September, to be gathered in May and June, being\r\nprotected during winter like the Early Paris; (2) in February, in a\r\nhot-bed, or under hand-glasses or frames, to be gathered in June and\r\nJuly; (3) at the first of March, also in hot-bed, to be set out in April\r\nand gathered in July; (4) finally, it may be sown in June on a border of\r\nrich mold, and set out in July, without having been transplanted. This\r\nvery simple method requires frequent waterings to yield good results.\r\nThe crop is gathered from September to November.\"\r\n\r\nThe name _Gros Salomon_, now given by Vilmorin and others as synonymous\r\nwith Half Early Paris, was applied by Ribaud, in 1852, to a separate\r\nvariety (_Annales de la Société d' Horticulture de l' Allier_, 1852, p.\r\n59). For remarks on the synonym \"Nonpareil,\" see that name.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, of Massachusetts, says of the Half-Early Paris or\r\n_Demi-dur_: \"This is the kind usually sold in this country as Early\r\nParis, the true variety making so small a head as to be comparatively\r\nworthless here.\"--(Gregory, \"Cabbages and How to Grow Them,\" 1870, p.\r\n69).\r\n\r\nHALF EARLY ST. BRIEUC (_Demi-dur de St. Brieuc_).--\"Plant large\r\nand strong; leaves quite large, elongated, undulate and of a deep green;\r\nstem long; head close, solid, and remaining a long time in good\r\ncondition. This variety, which is extensively cultivated around St.\r\nBrieuc, [on the north coast of France] from which it is exported to\r\nParis, and even to England, is quite hardy, and is well adapted to\r\nopen-air culture.\"--(Vilmorin).\r\n\r\nThe St. Brieuc was described by M. May, in the _Revue Horticole_, in\r\n1880, as \"a hardy, but late variety, inferior in its head to our Paris\r\nvarieties, and not very generally cultivated.\"\r\n\r\nAt the New York experiment station in 1886, this variety gave good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nHASKELL'S FAVORITE.--As grown at the South Dakota experiment\r\nstation, in 1888, no difference was seen between this and Henderson's\r\nSnowball. Seed was sown in hot-bed April 10, the plants set out in\r\nwell-manured soil, May 24, and the first heads cut July 13--from which\r\ntime the plants continued to head along through the season. The\r\nintroducer, George S. Haskell, of Rockford, Ill., writes: \"The Early\r\nFavorite we sell is a variety I found in Holland a number of years ago.\r\nIt has proved a very sure header in this section of the country, and\r\nwill yield more than other sorts. It is not of the 'Erfurt family,' but\r\nabout half way between the Early Paris and Erfurt.\"\r\n\r\nHENDERSON'S EARLY SNOWBALL.--A German variety, derived from the\r\nDwarf Erfurt, introduced by Peter Henderson & Co., about 1878, and\r\nwhich has become very popular. Gregory, in 1890, said that it was not\r\nexcelled by any other variety, unless it was Thorburn's Gilt Edge, and\r\nthat it combined the best characteristics of Berlin Dwarf, Extra Early\r\nErfurt, and Sea Foam. Henderson & Co. state that it is now grown for\r\nforcing more largely than any other variety. It is also considerably\r\ngrown in field culture, not only for the early crop, for which it is\r\nespecially suited, but also for the late crop, the plants being set out\r\nas late as the first of August. Its small size and reliability of\r\nheading are valuable features where suitable soil and culture are given.\r\nThe high price of the seed and the lack of vigor in much of the seed of\r\nthis and other Dwarf Erfurt varieties, have prevented their cultivation\r\non as large a scale as they would otherwise be grown.\r\n\r\nThis variety was formerly sold by many seedsmen simply as Early\r\nSnowball, and it is the one now usually referred to when the name Early\r\nSnowball is used, (See Early Snowball.)\r\n\r\nW. J. Green, of the Ohio experiment station, says of Henderson's\r\nSnowball: \"This justly celebrated strain of Early [Extra Early] Erfurt\r\nis probably better known than the parent variety. The true Henderson's\r\nEarly Snowball is unexcelled, but there are other strains, and other\r\nvarieties even, that have been sent out under this name, which are very\r\ninferior.\"\r\n\r\nThe stock of this variety is now all controlled Peter Henderson & Co.,\r\nand is grown in Germany. Seed descended from Henderson's stock has been\r\ngrown at Puget Sound, and is claimed to be as good as the original.\r\nSeveral other sorts, including Puritan, Padilla and Gilt Edge, have been\r\nderived from Henderson's Snowball, which sometimes mature quite as early\r\nas this variety.\r\n\r\nIDEAL, see _Vick's Ideal_.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL.--May says, in the _Revue Horticole_, for 1880: \"A\r\nvariety which seems to have originated from the Early Dwarf Erfurt,\r\nbeing a little more vigorous, and producing a little larger heads, which\r\nis without doubt a result of culture, for in head and leaf it wholly\r\nresembles the Erfurt. It is an excellent variety, employed in the same\r\nmanner as the Erfurt, and deserves extended cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nVilmorin says: \"This fine variety resembles the Dwarf Early Erfurt, but\r\nit is of deeper green, and every way larger. It is an early variety with\r\nbeautiful white head, large and solid, and remarkable for its regularity\r\nof growth and product. When well grown it is certainly among the most\r\ndesirable early varieties.\" Thorburn considers it one of the best for\r\nthe main crop. It originated about 1870. It matured in one season\r\neighteen days and in another thirty-two days before the\r\nLenormand.--(_The Garden_, 1878, p. 2).\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL NOVELTY (Landreth), see _Imperial_.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED EARLY PARIS, see _Boston Market_.\r\n\r\nITALIAN GIANT.--There are two or more forms of this variety in\r\nthe market. For example: Vick sells \"Italian Giant;\" Gregory, \"Italian\r\nEarly Giant;\" the Plant Seed Company, \"Italian Early Giant Autumnal;\"\r\nVilmorin, \"Half-Early Italian Giant (new);\" Frotzer, \"Late Italian\r\nGiant;\" and Vilmorin, \"Late Giant Italian Self-protecting.\" The early\r\nform or variety seems to be the most generally sold by our seedsmen, and\r\nis perhaps the one indicated when the simple name Italian Giant is used.\r\nGregory calls the Early Italian Giant a \"fine, large white-headed early\r\nVariety.\" Frotzer says it is not quite so late as the Late Italian,\r\nalmost as large, and in every way satisfactory. The Late Italian Giant,\r\nhe says, is grown to a considerable extent in the neighborhood of New\r\nOrleans, and is the largest of all the cauliflowers and should not be\r\nsown later than June, as it requires from seven to nine months to head.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON & STOKES' EARLY ALABASTER, see _Alabaster_.\r\n\r\nKING, see _Sutton's King_.\r\n\r\nKNICKERBOCKER.--An early Variety with \"fine large compact\r\nsnow-white heads of excellent flavor.\"--(E. & W. Hackett, Adelaide,\r\nAustralia, 1889).\r\n\r\nLACKAWANNA.--All American variety sent out by Tillinghast,\r\nabout 1884, and said to be a little larger and later than Henderson's\r\nSnowball.\r\n\r\nLANDRETH'S FIRST.--As grown at the New York experiment station\r\nin 1885, it was equal in earliness to the Early Dwarf Erfurt, and\r\nsurpassed only by Henderson's Snowball.\r\n\r\nLARGE ALGIERS, see _Algiers_.\r\n\r\nLARGE ASIATIC, see _Asiatic_.\r\n\r\nLARGE ERFURT.--A name sometimes applied to the ordinary Early\r\nErfurt, in distinction from the Dwarf Erfurt.\r\n\r\nLARGE EARLY DWARF ERFURT (Thorburn), see _Early Erfurt_.\r\n\r\nLARGE EARLY LONDON.--Failed to head at the New York experiment\r\nstation, in 1882. In 1885 a small proportion of the plants headed; it\r\nwas the latest among 38 varieties.\r\n\r\nLARGE EARLY WHITE ERFURT.--Brill calls this the lowest grade of\r\nthe Erfurt type, succeeding admirably at times, but not to be depended\r\non, and apt to grow with small fine leaves through the heads. See Early\r\nErfurt.\r\n\r\nLARGE LATE ALGIERS, see _Algiers_.\r\n\r\nLARGE LATE ASIATIC, see _Asiatic_.\r\n\r\nLARGE LATE WALCHEREN (Dreer), see _Walcheren_.\r\n\r\nLARGE WHITE FRENCH.--A fine large white variety, catalogued by\r\nGregory and others in 1890. Vilmorin calls it half-early.\r\n\r\nLARGEST ASIATIC.--Taller and larger than the common Asiatic,\r\nbut apparently no longer grown. The _Gardener's Chronicle_ for 1848\r\nmentions its being sold by Messrs. Schertzer, of Haarlem.\r\n\r\nLAING'S EARLY ADVANCE.--A writer in the _Gardener's Chronicle_,\r\nfor 1891, p. 121, states that he has grown it for the past three years\r\nand finds it a good variety, with close white heads of moderate size,\r\nprotected by many well-incurved leaves, and ready for use about five\r\nmonths from the time of sowing the seed.\r\n\r\nLATE DUTCH (_Large Late Dutch_).--Sold by several American\r\nseedmen. Probably distinct from Early Dutch.\r\n\r\nLATE LENORMAND SHORT-STEM, see _Lenormand Short-Stem_.\r\n\r\nLATE LONDON (Burpee and Ferry).--No description. See Asiatic\r\nand Large Early London.\r\n\r\nLATE PARIS (_Dur de Paris_).--This, said Vilmorin in 1883, is\r\nthe latest variety cultivated by the market gardeners around Paris. It\r\ndiffers from the Half Early Paris, especially in being a little later,\r\nand in having its head remain hard and solid a long time; but it is also\r\ndistinguished by the appearance of its foliage, which is quite\r\nabundant, elongated, very much undulated, and of an intense green.\r\n\r\nThis variety is the least cultivated of the three generally grown at\r\nParis. The gardeners use it only for the summer sowing to come at the\r\nend of the season. It is now being supplanted by other late sorts.\r\n\r\nLATE WALCHEREN, see _Walcheren_.\r\n\r\nLEFEVRE.--Said to have been one of the best four varieties for\r\nCentral France in 1852, the others being _Demi-dur de Paris_ (Half Early\r\nParis), Early Duke, and _Gros Salomon_.\r\n\r\nLE MAITRE PIED COURT.--As grown at the New York experiment\r\nstation in 1885, it was rather early. Probably the same as the\r\n\"Lemaitre\" or Chambourcy Short-Stemmed, catalogued by Vilmorin in 1890.\r\n\r\nLENORMAND (_Ancient Lenormand_, _Late Lenormand_, _Lenormand\r\nExtra Large_, _Lenormand Mammoth_).--Vilmorin said, in 1883: \"It is now\r\na score of years since the attention of the trade was called to this\r\nvariety, principally because of its beauty and its great hardiness\r\nagainst cold. The Lenormand is in appearance but little different from\r\nthe Half Early Paris (_Demi-dur_). The leaves are only a little larger.\r\nIt certainly requires a little less care than other varieties, but its\r\nchief merit is having given birth to the Lenormand Short-stemmed, which\r\nis to-day one of the most generally prized.\"\r\n\r\nM. May describes and figures this variety in the _Revue Horticole_ for\r\n1880. In the _Journal of the Central Horticultural Society of France_\r\nfor 1857 is a report of a committee of that society upon this variety as\r\ngrown on the grounds of M. Lenormand near Paris, it having been\r\nintroduced by that gentleman in 1852 from Halle, in Central Germany,\r\nwhere it was then largely cultivated. The committee made a very\r\nflattering report, finding the Lenormand much finer than the other\r\nvarieties, Half Early Paris, Erfurt, and Alma, growing in the same\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIn this country the Lenormand was formerly a popular variety, being\r\nfrequently mentioned, as long ago as 1858, with the Early Paris as one\r\nof the two best varieties. Since then it has been displaced by the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nLENORMAND SHORT-STEM.--This variety, derived from the\r\nLenormand, is described by Vilmorin in 1883 as follows: \"The aspect of\r\nthis variety is very characteristic, and enables it to be distinguished\r\neasily from all others when it is well grown. The stem, extremely short,\r\nstrong and stocky, is furnished down to the level of the earth with\r\nshort, large, rounded leaves, slightly undulated except on the borders,\r\nvery firm and stiff, and more spreading than upright; color deep green,\r\nslightly glaucous; head very large and solid, beautifully white, and\r\nkeeping in condition a long time. This variety is early, productive,\r\nhardy against cold and drouth, and requires comparatively little room.\r\nIts rapid extention in cultivation within the last few years is not\r\ntherefore surprising.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo this it may be added that the variety is sold by nearly all our\r\nAmerican seedmen and is a popular variety for a fall crop, especially at\r\nthe South. Its large, solid, cream-colored heads are not however as well\r\nprotected by the leaves as those of most other medium early or late\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nLENORMAND'S SHORT-STEMMED MAMMOTH (_Lenormand's Extra Large\r\nShort-Stemmed_).--This appears to be a selection from the Lenormand\r\nShort-stem. It is offered under the second of the above names by\r\nVilmorin, and under the first by Gregory and other American seedsmen.\r\n\r\nLONG ISLAND BEAUTY (Brill), see _Early Padilla_. At the\r\nColorado station, in 1888, seeds of Long Island Beauty obtained from Low\r\nappeared to be an inferior stock, and gave heads which were loose and\r\nyellowish. For the origin of this variety see Early Padilla.\r\n\r\nMALTA GIANT (Burpee), see _Giant Malta_.\r\n\r\nMARTIN'S PRESIDENT.--As grown by Mr. R. Gilbert at Burghley,\r\nEngland, in 1885, this variety stood the exceptionally dry season better\r\nthan Best of All, Snowball, Early Erfurt, or Veitch's Autumn\r\nGiant.--(_Gardening Illustrated_, 1885, p. 438).\r\n\r\nMAULE'S PRIZE EARLIEST, see _Prize_.\r\n\r\nMITCHELL'S HARDY EARLY.--Said by F. Burr, in 1866, to be \"a new\r\nvariety, bouquet not large, but handsome and compact. It is so firm that\r\nit remains an unusual length of time without running to seed or becoming\r\npithy.\"\r\n\r\nMODEL.--The Northrup, Braslan & Goodwin Co., of Minneapolis,\r\nMinnesota, the introducers of this variety, say in 1891: \"The history\r\nof our Model cauliflower we can give you in a few words: We have for\r\nseveral years been testing cauliflower seed from as many growers as\r\npossible, in order to secure a variety which we could identify with our\r\nname. We have never been fully satisfied until two years ago, when we\r\nreceived from a foreign grower a sample for trial. Upon testing this\r\nseed in our experimental grounds we found it so desirable that we\r\narranged for the stock we are now selling, and which gives excellent\r\nsatisfaction wherever grown. There are other varieties which produce as\r\ngood heads and as early, but in our growths of this sort we have found a\r\nlarger proportion of large, white, perfect heads than in any other\r\nstrains we have tested.\"\r\n\r\nMOHAWK WHITE CAP (Nellis).--\"Rather larger and later than Early\r\n[Extra Early] Erfurt and seems to be identical with Snowball from the\r\nsame firm.\"--(Ohio Exp. Station, 1889)\r\n\r\nMT. BLANC.--Said by Buist, in 1890, to be one of the largest\r\nand finest for forcing, or the general crop. Stem medium; heads large,\r\nsnow-white, well protected by the leaves, and of delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nAt the Oregon experiment station, in 1890, Carter's Mt. Blanc resembled\r\nPerfection in growth, but had somewhat larger heads.\r\n\r\nNAPLES, GIANT, see _Veitch's Autumn Giant_.\r\n\r\nNARROW-LEAVED ERFURT, see _Small-Leaved Erfurt_.\r\n\r\nNE PLUS ULTRA.--A fine early variety, derived from the Giant\r\nNaples, having well-filled heads, often nine inches in diameter. Highly\r\nrecommended by Wolfner and Weisz of Vienna, but little grown in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNONPAREIL.--In most American catalogues this is given as\r\nsynonymous with Half Early Paris. Buist and Rawson catalogue it as a\r\nseparate variety, and Brill mentioned it in 1872 as a distinct variety.\r\nAt the New York experiment station, in 1885, a variety called Thorburn's\r\nNonpareil matured among the half-early sorts at the same time as\r\nLenormand Short-stem. J. M. Thorburn & Co. write me in 1891 that\r\nNonpareil is a name which they gave to the Half Early Paris when they\r\nfirst introduced that variety to the trade in this country.\r\n\r\nNORTHRUP, BRASLAN & GOODWIN CO.'S MODEL, see _Model_.\r\n\r\nPADILLA, see _Early Padilla_.\r\n\r\nPALERMO VIOLET.--A variety catalogued by Wolfner and Weisz, of\r\nVienna, in 1888.\r\n\r\nPAQUES.--A variety with fine white heads, usually classed with\r\nthe Broccolis. Catalogued by Vilmorin, in 1890.\r\n\r\nPARIS, see _Early Paris_.\r\n\r\nPEARCE'S SNOW-STORM (_J. S. Pearce & Co.'s Snow-Storm_).--This\r\nvariety, introduced by these seedsmen, of London, Canada, 1886, appears\r\nfrom their description to be a selection from the Dwarf Erfurt.\r\n\r\nPEARL (_Veitch's Pearl_).--A good second-early sort sent out\r\nabout eight years ago; said by some to be too near King in character. It\r\nseems to be no longer grown.\r\n\r\nPERFECTION (_March's No. 9_).--Received from H. A. March, of\r\nFidalgo, Washington, and grown at the Oregon experiment station in 1890,\r\nit was found to be equally good with Snowball, and similar in growth to\r\nMt. Blanc, but with a little smaller head. Mr. March writes me as\r\nfollows, under date of April 3, 1891:\r\n\r\n\"My Early Perfection, or 'No. 9,' was a sport or, 'stray seed' found\r\namong some Erfurt Earliest Dwarf, imported seed; and being the first in\r\nthe field to form a head by over a week, I naturally saved it for 'stock\r\nseed,' and as it propagated itself perfectly, and as it was perfection\r\nitself, I named it Early Perfection. I am not aware of another by the\r\nname of Perfection in the market.\"\r\n\r\nPICPUS EARLY HARDY.--At the New York experiment station in 1885\r\nthis proved to be a large, rather early sort. Vilmorin includes it in\r\nhis latest catalogue, but it is not in the American catalogues.\r\n\r\nPRIZE (_Maule's Prize Earliest_).--An Erfurt variety sent out,\r\nby Wm. H. Maule, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPURITAN, see _Early Puritan_.\r\n\r\nRAWSON'S EXTRA EARLY SEA FOAM.--Said by Rawson in 1886 to be\r\nthe best forcing variety; dwarf, very compact, with large, firm,\r\nwell-rounded heads, pure white, and of the best quality. At the Ohio\r\nexperiment station in 1889 it appeared to be the same as Early [Extra\r\nEarly] Erfurt.\r\n\r\nRICE'S GIANT SNOWBALL.--A late sort, which failed to head well\r\nat the New York experiment station in 1883.\r\n\r\nST. BRIEUC, see _Half Early St. Brieuc_.\r\n\r\nSMALL-LEAVED ERFURT (_Earliest Dwarf Small-Leaved Erfurt_,\r\n_Narrow-Leaved Erfurt_).--This, according to Brill, differs from \"Erfurt\r\nExtra Dwarf Earliest\" in having very narrow, pointed leaves which grow\r\nperfectly upright, thus adapting it for close cultivation or for\r\nforcing. It grows rapidly, which adapts it for spring cultivation; and\r\nfor a fall crop it may be sown later than any other variety--on Long\r\nIsland usually as late as July 1st.\r\n\r\nSNOW'S WINTER WHITE.--A late variety usually classed with the\r\nBroccolis.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL, see _Early Snowball_.\r\n\r\nSTADTHOLDER.--Burr, in 1866, said, \"A recent variety introduced\r\nfrom Holland.... In the vicinity of London, where it is largely\r\ncultivated for the mediate between the Early Dutch and Walcheren. The\r\nstem is a little shorter than that of other Holland cauliflowers [which\r\nhave rather tall stems], and the leaves are more undulated on the\r\nborder.\" The Stadtholder appears to be a good sort, but hardly equal to\r\nAutumn Giant and some others which protect the head better, and which\r\nhave now largely displaced it in cultivation. It has never been grown to\r\nany extent in the United States.\r\n\r\nSURPRISE, see _Early Dwarf Surprise_.\r\n\r\nSUTTON'S FAVORITE.--Said by Sutton & Sons, of Reading, England,\r\nto be seven to twelve days earlier than Early London, of level and\r\ncompact habit, and good to succeed Sutton's Magnum Bonum.\r\n\r\nSUTTON'S FIRST CROP.--Said to be the earliest to head, very\r\ndwarf and compact, having snowy white heads, and so few leaves that it\r\nmay be planted closer than any other kind.\r\n\r\nSUTTON'S KING.--Said by Sutton & Sons to be \"the best\r\ncauliflower for general use, coming in immediately after Sutton's\r\nFavorite. Plant dwarf and compact, with large, firm, beautifully white\r\nheads. Endures drouth well. Said to produce a greater weight on a given\r\narea than other market, it is considered equal, if not superior, to the\r\nWalcheren.\" Vilmorin describes it as follows: \"Very near Early Dutch,\r\nbeing distinguished mainly by being a few days later, being thus\r\ninter-variety. Heads have been grown weighing 28 pounds.\"\r\n\r\nSUTTON'S MAGNUM BONUM.--Sutton in 1888 says: \"We introduced\r\nthis cauliflower to our customers last year as the finest and most\r\ndelicately flavored variety we have grown.\" Heads large, firm, snowy\r\nwhite; plant medium early, of strong, dwarf, habit and broad leaves,\r\nwhich \"are serviceable for shading the heads.\"\r\n\r\nSUTTON'S SNOWBALL.--A very early dwarf variety mentioned in the\r\n_Garden_ in 1875.\r\n\r\nTARANTO.--Offered as new by J. M. Thorburn, in 1891, and said\r\nto be very large and to resemble Autumn Giant.\r\n\r\nTHORBURN'S EARLY SNOWBALL (Thorburn, 1890).--No description.\r\n\r\nTHORBURN'S GILT EDGE.--Gregory says in 1890: \"This is\r\nundoubtedly the finest strain of the Snowball variety. It is a little\r\nlater and larger than the common Snowball, and can be left longer in the\r\nfield without decaying. I considered it the best of all the dozen\r\nvarieties raised in my experimental grounds this season.\"\r\n\r\nTHORBURN'S NONPAREIL, see _Nonpareil_.\r\n\r\nTHORBURN'S WONDERFUL.--At the New York experiment station in\r\n1883 this variety matured with Veitch's Autumn Giant and Walcheren, and\r\nwas larger than either of those. At the same station in 1885 a variety\r\ncalled Wonderful, probably the same, was the latest of 30 sorts, being\r\nsown March 30th, set out May 4th, and gathered Oct. 27th.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN'S EARLIEST DWARF ERFURT.--In his catalogue for 1891,\r\nVaughn says that this is the highest priced and finest strain of the\r\nEarliest Dwarf Erfurt, imported from Erfurt Germany. This strain has\r\nbeen imported by him for several years. He remarks that many strains of\r\nDwarf Erfurt are given special names by other seedsmen.\r\n\r\nVEITCH'S AUTUMN GIANT (_Autumn Giant_, _Giant Naples_,\r\n_Frankfort Giant_).--No other new variety of cauliflower has attracted\r\nso much attention as this. It was introduced into England about 1869,\r\nsince when it has become very popular there for a late crop and for\r\nsummer. It is rather too late for the ordinary fall crop in this\r\ncountry, though a favorite with some growers on both the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts.\r\n\r\nIt was described by Vilmorin in 1883, as follows, under the name Giant\r\nNaples, but is now sold by him as Autumn Giant: \"Plant large and\r\nvigorous, stem rather tall, leaves abundant, somewhat undulated, of a\r\ndeep green. The interior leaves turn in well over the head, which is\r\nvery large, solid, and white. It is a late variety of the same period as\r\nWalcheren, but less hardy. At the north it can be employed for the\r\nlatest crop in open air culture by being sown in April or May.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Vincent Berthault gave the following account of this variety in\r\nthe _Revue Horticole_: \"This variety is still rare and little known in\r\nFrance. I planted it last year for trial and obtained results which were\r\nthe admiration of all who saw them. It was from my small crop that I\r\ntook the four which I had the honor to present to the Central\r\nHorticultural Society of France at its meeting on August 25, 1883. Some\r\nof these cauliflowers were 35 to 38 centimeters [more than a foot] in\r\ndiameter, and weighed, including stem and leaves, 12 to 13 kilograms\r\n[nearly 30 pounds] which is extraordinary for this time of the year,\r\nwhen it is difficult to obtain cauliflowers of even ordinary size. At\r\none time I feared that their size was to the detriment of their quality,\r\nbut it has proved otherwise, and in all respects they are excellent, and\r\nas good as beautiful. In fact they are perfect.\r\n\r\n\"The general characters of the Autumn Giant differ materially from those\r\nof other varieties.\r\n\r\n\"The young seedlings become at once very tall and upright, and even\r\nafter being set out and planted as deep as the first leaves they quickly\r\nassume their usual stellate appearance, and for about six weeks they are\r\nsimply furnished with eight or ten long narrow leaves borne on a long\r\nstem. So up to this time the plants are not very promising, and one is\r\ntempted to pull them up; but after this the plants rapidly change in\r\nappearance; a dozen new leaves are quickly developed, and the plants\r\ntake on a half-upright form which recalls that of the Half Early Paris\r\nvariety. As to the head, it is more conical than flat. The leaves\r\nsometimes attain a length of 90 centimeters [nearly three feet], by 40\r\ncentimeters broad. It is then that extra care should be given. The\r\nwaterings ought to be copious and frequent, especially at the time of\r\nthe formation of the heads, when I apply about 10 to 15 litres of water\r\nto each head every other day. This, which certainly contributed to the\r\ngood result, is how I grew my plants. I chose good soil, which I\r\nprepared during the winter, placing in the bottom of the furrow a good\r\nthickness of manure, and a month before planting, or even at the time of\r\ndoing so, I spread on the surface a covering of decomposed manure, which\r\nI incorporated with the soil by means of ordinary tillage. I visited the\r\nplantation every day, not only to destroy the caterpillars, but to cover\r\nthe heads with leaves, which it was necessary to look after at least\r\nevery other day in order to preserve the whiteness of the heads. These\r\nattentions are indispensable if one would secure a product of first\r\nquality, free from insects. As to sowing the seed, it may be begun\r\nabout the 15th of September, and the plants wintered over under\r\nhand-glasses, or in frames, to be set out in March, when heads will be\r\nobtained in July. The plants of this sowing may also be set in hot-beds\r\nin January and February, but this only in default of other varieties,\r\nfor they will be too tall and spreading.\r\n\r\n\"It is in February, on a bed with mild heat and under glass, that I make\r\nmy sowing to obtain plants which are to head in August and September,\r\nand which give my best returns. A final sowing may be made at the end of\r\nMarch or beginning of April; it matures its crop in October and\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion of the Autumn Giant is that it is destined to play an\r\nimportant part in the market-gardening of the country when, probably in\r\nthe near future, there shall have been produced dwarf varieties\r\nanalogous to those which we already possess from other sorts.\"\r\n\r\nVEITCH'S EARLY FORCING.--This variety \"has small compact\r\nhearts, very close and white. The habit of the plant is dwarf and\r\nsturdy, and it is well adapted for forcing.\"--(_Gardening Illustrated_,\r\n1885, p. 427). It is favorably mentioned by several writers in the\r\n_Gardener's Chronicle_ for 1884 and 1885. In the _Garden_ for 1882\r\nVeitch's Early is said to be two weeks earlier than Early London.\r\n\r\nVEITCH'S PEARL, see _Pearl_.\r\n\r\nVEITCH'S SELF-PROTECTING.--Said by the _Gardener's Chronicle_,\r\nin 1874, to be a new variety, just tested by Mr. Veitch, much later than\r\nAutumn Giant, hardy, and very self-protecting.\r\n\r\nVICK'S IDEAL.--James Vick says in 1890: \"We introduced the\r\n'Ideal' to public notice in 1886, and claimed for it superiority to any\r\nother variety in the following points: Reliability of heading, size and\r\nsolidity of heads, earliness, and protective habit of inner leaves.\"\r\nFurther tests by himself and others he says substantiate these claims.\r\nThe plants are said to be very dwarf, with erect outer leaves. At the\r\nNew York experiment station, in 1889, it was a few days later than the\r\nthree other varieties on trial. At the Ohio station the same year it was\r\nconsidered one of the best strains of Early [Extra Early] Erfurt.\r\n\r\nVIENNA CHILD.--Catalogued by Wolfner and Weisz, of Vienna, in\r\n1888, at the highest price, as a fine new market-garden sort.\r\n\r\nVIENNA EARLY DWARF, see _Early Dwarf Vienna_.\r\n\r\nWAITE'S ALMA, see _Alma_.\r\n\r\nWALCHEREN.--This old German variety is intermediate in\r\ncharacter between the true cauliflowers and the broccolis, and it has,\r\nfrom the first, been frequently called Walcheren Broccoli. There seems\r\nto have originally been two varieties, Early and Late. The earliest\r\nappearance of the name Walcheren that I have seen is in an advertisement\r\nof Walcheren cauliflower seed in the _Gardener's Chronicle_ for 1844.\r\nSince that time it has remained one of the most reliable and popular\r\nvarieties with English growers.\r\n\r\nMcIntosh, in his \"Book of the Garden,\" in 1855, said that it was hard to\r\nget pure seed: \"The true Walcheren is distinguished from all others by\r\nits bluntly rounded and broad leaves, and the closeness and almost snowy\r\nwhiteness of its heads, even when grown to a large size.\" Others, before\r\nthis, state that it was sold on the Continent under the name of Early\r\nLeyden.\r\n\r\nBurr, in 1866, records it as synonymous with both Early Leyden, and\r\nLegge's Walcheren broccoli or cauliflower. He describes it as resisting\r\nboth cold and drouth better than other varieties, \"stem short, leaves\r\nbroad, less pointed and more undulated than those of the cauliflower\r\nusually are.\"\r\n\r\nVilmorin described it in 1883 as synonymous with Walcheren Broccoli,\r\nknown in Holland as Late Walcheren. He said: \"The latest and most hardy\r\nof the cauliflowers, and therefore intermediate between the cauliflowers\r\nand the broccolis, with which latter it is often classed. Stem high and\r\nstrong, leaves elongated, rather stiff and upright, abundant, and of a\r\nslightly grayish green. The head forms very late, and is fine, large,\r\nand very white, of fine close grain. The seed requires to be sown at\r\nWalcheren, [an island on the coast of Holland] in April, in order to be\r\ncertain of heading before frost. If sown later it often passes the\r\nwinter and heads early in the spring.\"\r\n\r\nSibley, in 1887, sold this variety under the name of Early Walcheren,\r\nthough giving it the usual characters and season of the ordinary late\r\nsort. Buist, in 1890, mentions it as a favorite, very hardy, late\r\nvariety. It is sold by most of our seedsmen, but is less popular in this\r\ncountry than in England. Sutton, the English seedsman, describes it in\r\nhis latest catalogue as an \"excellent mid-season cauliflower.\" It is\r\nless liable to button in dry weather than most other varieties, but\r\nsometimes forms imperfect heads.\r\n\r\nWEBB'S EARLY MAMMOTH.--A variety advertised as follows by Webb\r\n& Sons of Wordsley, Stourbridge, England, in _The Garden_, Feb. 9, 1878:\r\n\"An excellent compact variety; stands the drought remarkably well; heads\r\nlarge, firm, and beautifully white. The best of all for the main crop.\"\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON.--Introduced about 1860. Henderson & Co. describe it\r\nas the finest kind in cultivation; pure white; size of head over two\r\nfeet in circumference, and as large as thirteen inches diameter; very\r\ndwarf, the stem not more than two or three inches from the soil, but\r\nwith ample foliage; one of the hardiest varieties known, and said to\r\nwithstand well the variable climate of the United States. C. G. Anderson\r\n& Sons of England, in 1880, claimed it to be earlier, white, and closer\r\nthan Early London.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _New England Farmer_, in 1871, speaks of it as larger\r\nthan either Early Erfurt or Early Paris.\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL, see _Thorburn's Wonderful_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF EARLINESS.\r\n\r\nThe following varieties cover the season, and are arranged in the order\r\nof earliness, as near as can be determined. Many well known kinds are\r\nomitted, and some little known sorts inserted, the only attempt being to\r\nform a scale of maturity:\r\n\r\n Early Dwarf Erfurt.\r\n Extra Early Paris.\r\n Early London.\r\n Asiatic.\r\n Early Erfurt.\r\n Early Paris.\r\n Lenormand Short-Stem.\r\n Late Paris.\r\n St. Brieuc.\r\n Algiers.\r\n Veitch's Autumn Giant.\r\n Giant Naples.\r\n Veitch's Self-Protecting.\r\n Late Italian Giant.\r\n Walcheren.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETY TESTS.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK EXPERIMENT STATION (_Geneva_).--In 1883 the following\r\ntwenty-two varieties were sown April 16, and eleven plants of each\r\nvariety set out May 15. One variety, however, Rice's Giant Snowball, was\r\nsown May 13, and set out June 20. Treatment was the same as for cabbage.\r\n\r\n --------------------------+---------+----------+---------+------------\r\n                           |         |          |         | Diameter\r\n                           | First   |          |         | of largest\r\n          VARIETY.         | head in |  No. of  |  No. of | head in\r\n                           | days.   |  plants. |  heads. | inches.\r\n --------------------------+---------+----------+---------+------------\r\n Algiers                   |   159   |    6     |    5    |     9\r\n Algerian Late             |   142   |    9     |    1    |     6\r\n Berlin Dwarf              |   124   |    8     |    2    |     5\r\n Carter's Defiance         |   124   |    7     |    6    |    --\r\n Carter's Dwarf Mammoth    |   124   |    6     |    2    |     9\r\n Earliest Dwarf Erfurt     |   124   |   10     |    4    |     7\r\n Erfurt Early Dwarf        |   131   |    6     |    3    |     5\r\n Early Dutch               |   142   |    7     |    3    |     6\r\n Early London              |   129   |    6     |    4    |     9\r\n Extra Early Paris         |   142   |    3     |    2    |     9\r\n Gerry Island              |   133   |    3     |    3    |     6\r\n Imperial                  |   119   |    8     |    7    |    10\r\n Italian Giant White       |   175   |    6     |    1    |    10\r\n Large Late London         |   128   |    6     |    5    |     7\r\n Large White French        |   105   |    8     |    8    |     6\r\n Lenormand's Short-Stemm'd |   128   |    5     |    5    |     8\r\n Rice's Giant Snowball     |   152   |    7     |    1    |     4\r\n Snowball                  |   128   |    5     |    4    |     6\r\n Stadtholder               |   128   |    6     |    5    |     9\r\n Thorburn's Wonderful      |   128   |    4     |    4    |     6\r\n Veitch's Autumn Giant     |   128   |    6     |    3    |     6\r\n Walcheren                 |   128   |    3     |    3    |     6\r\n --------------------------+---------+----------+---------+------------\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the following twenty varieties were grown. The seeds were sown\r\nin a green-house March 5 and 6, and the plants set out May 2. It appears\r\nfrom the table that some of the varieties called \"late,\" formed heads\r\nearlier than others called \"early.\" The Lenormand Extra Large was the\r\nearliest, forming its first head in 149 days, the Lackawanna heading a\r\nday later. None of the heads were extra large:\r\n\r\n ------------------------------+---------+-----------+-----------\r\n                               | First   |           |\r\n            VARIETY.           | head in | Plants    | Number of\r\n                               | days.   | survived. | heads.\r\n ------------------------------+---------+-----------+-----------\r\n Dwarf Erfurt                  |   182   |     4     |     4\r\n Early Dutch or Early London   |   180   |     5     |     4\r\n Early Dwarf Surprise          |   175   |     6     |     6\r\n Eclipse                       |   162   |     7     |     6\r\n Half-Early Large White French |   190   |     9     |     6\r\n Half-Early Paris              |   197   |     8     |     7\r\n Imperial                      |   160   |     8     |     8\r\n Lackawanna                    |   150   |     9     |     8\r\n Large Algiers                 |   189   |     6     |     3\r\n Large Late Asiatic            |   156   |     4     |     4\r\n Large Late Stadtholder        |    --   |     8     |     3\r\n Late Giant Italian            |   154   |     8     |     8\r\n Late Paris                    |   170   |     4     |     3\r\n Lenormand's Extra Large       |   149   |     7     |     6\r\n Lenormand's Short-Stemmed     |   161   |     8     |     6\r\n Paris Extra Early             |   154   |     6     |     6\r\n Sea Foam                      |   182   |     3     |     2\r\n Veitch's Autumn Giant         |   182   |     6     |     3\r\n Very Dwarf Alleaume           |   189   |     8     |     6\r\n Walcheren                     |   182   |     6     |     4\r\n ------------------------------+---------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the following varieties were planted in the green-house March\r\n30, and sixteen plants of each, with a few exceptions, transplanted to\r\nthe garden May 4. The plants of Algiers and Le Maitre Pied Court were\r\ntransplanted May 20, and those of the Wonderful May 21. The plants were\r\nset in rows three and one-half feet apart, and eighteen inches apart in\r\nthe rows. Many were destroyed by various causes, and though the places\r\nwere twice reset there were many vacancies.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, Henderson's Early Snowball (from Henderson in 1885) was\r\nthe earliest, forming the first head July 8, or ninety-seven days from\r\nsowing the seed. The heads also were rather above the average in size.\r\nExtra selected Dwarf Erfurt was the second in earliness and every plant\r\nheaded.\r\n\r\nA notable fact brought out by this table is the effect of the early\r\nplanting on the late and half-early varieties. It might be supposed, as\r\nthese varieties require a long season, that this early planting would\r\ngive the best results, enabling them to attain their full development.\r\nBut it appears that it caused many of the plants to head prematurely\r\nwhen small, while it greatly prolonged the season of the variety.\r\n\r\n ---------------------------------+----------+---------+--------+----------\r\n                                  |          |         |        | Average\r\n             VARIETY.             |  First   | No. of  | No. of | diameter\r\n                                  |  head.   | plants. | heads. | of head.\r\n ---------------------------------+----------+---------+--------+----------\r\n Algiers                          | Aug.  14 |   22    |   19   |  7-½\r\n Alleaume                         | Sept. 24 |    5    |    4   |  7\r\n Autumn Giant                     |  \"    24 |   17    |   17   |  7\r\n D'Alger                          |  \"    15 |   14    |   12   |  7-½\r\n Demi dur de St. Brieuc           |  \"    15 |   11    |   11   |  7\r\n Early Dutch (dur d' Holland)     | Aug.  25 |   12    |    8   |  5\r\n Early Dwarf Erfurt (Thorburn)    | July  13 |   11    |   11   |  5-½\r\n Early Dwarf Erfurt (Vilmorin)    |  \"    13 |    5    |    4   |  5-½\r\n Early London                     | Aug.  25 |   16    |   12   |  7-½\r\n Early Paris                      | July  25 |   11    |    6   |  5-½\r\n Early Picpus                     | Aug.   5 |   12    |   10   |  8\r\n Early Snowball                   | July  31 |   17    |   15   |  7\r\n Extra E.

They were irrigated at planting time, and on\r\nMay 14 and 28, June 11, July 5 and 20, August 3 and 15 and on September\r\n5. The area in crop was one-third of an acre and the stand nearly\r\nperfect. The plants were hoed twice and cultivated six times. The soil,\r\na clay loam, was lacking in fertility for the best culture of the\r\ncabbage and the cauliflower. Of the varieties grown, Henderson's\r\nSnowball was the best, with the latter's Erfurt a good second.

It is,\r\ntherefore, remote from any large body of water, and although the soil in\r\nthat portion of the state is mainly a strong loam suitable for\r\ncauliflower, it is only in favorable seasons that good cauliflowers can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the exceptionally favorable season of 1889, some of the sorts then\r\nprominently before the public, were grown at the college, all of which\r\ngave very good results, with the exception of Autumn Giant, which failed\r\nto germinate. The American grown seeds, from H. A. March, of Fidalgo,\r\nWashington, were large and plump and gave strong vigorous plants, and as\r\ngood or better results than is usually obtained from imported seed. The\r\nfollowing varieties were sown March 13, and set out May 14. It was\r\ndifficult to detect any difference between Puritan, Gilt Edge, Denmark,\r\nPrize Earliest, Best Early, Snowball, and Erfurt, as they showed less\r\nvariation than appeared between the same sorts from different seedsmen.\r\n\r\nThe title \"edible maturity\" in the table refers to the period at which\r\nthe heads might be cut for one's own use, that is when they had attained\r\nthe size of one's two fists. \"Marketable maturity\" is when they had\r\ncompleted their growth and would remain solid no longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n ---------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+--------\r\n                      |         |Appearance of  |        |          |Per cent\r\n                      |         |young plants,  |Edible  |Mark't'ble|forming\r\n       Varieties.      | Source. |March 29.      |Maturity|Maturity. |heads.\r\n ---------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+--------\r\n Burpee's Best Early  |Burpee.  |Small; even.   | Aug.  5| Aug.  10 |   100\r\n Denmark              |Vaughn.  |Good; even.    | July 26| Aug.  10 |    83\r\n Earliest Dwarf Erfurt|Maule.   |Good; even.    | Aug. 27| Sept. 14 |    67\r\n Erfurt Earliest Dwarf|March.   |Small; even.   | Aug. 10| Aug.  27 |    92\r\n Early Snowball       |Henderson|Very weak;     | Aug.  5| Aug.  10 |   100\r\n                      |         |  uneven.      |        |          |\r\n Early Puritan        |Ferry.   |Small; even.   | Aug.  7| Aug.  13 |    92\r\n Gilt Edge            |Thorburn.|Weak; uneven.  | July 26| Aug.   8 |    93\r\n Maule's Prize        |Maule.   |Small; somewhat| July 24| Aug.   8 |    83\r\n   Earliest           |         |  uneven.      |        |          |\r\n Snowball             |March.   |Good; even.    | July 24| Aug.   8 |   100\r\n ---------------------+---------+---------------+--------+----------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nThe points to consider in selecting varieties are first, earliness or\r\ntime of maturity; second, the certainty of their forming good heads. The\r\nimportance of having well grown seed has already been mentioned. This\r\nbeing secured, the choice of varieties is largely a matter of\r\ncircumstances. A variety which is good for one climate, or for one\r\npurpose, may not be good for another. For the early crop, an account of\r\nwhich has already been given, the earliest variety obtainable should be\r\nused, as our springs at the North are short enough at best. The Earliest\r\nDwarf Erfurt strains include nearly all the earliest varieties now\r\ngrown, and, for this country, at least, are the best. The typical\r\nvariety is usually sold under the name Extra Early Dwarf Erfurt, and if\r\nproperly selected seed is secured, this is nearly or quite as early as\r\nany of the strains which have received special names. Among the best of\r\nthese latter are Henderson's Snowball, Thorburn's Gilt Edge, and Vick's\r\nIdeal, the latter a little the largest and latest. For growing under\r\nglass the first two of these varieties are as good as any. The earliest\r\nvarieties are now often grown also for the fall crop, particularly at\r\nthe North, by being sown late. Their greater certainty to head on time,\r\nand the increased number that can be grown on an acre, renders them\r\nespecially valuable.\r\n\r\nA variety which in the past has given the most general satisfaction for\r\nthe fall crop is Early Paris. Of the later maturing varieties, Veitch's\r\nAutumn Giant and Lenormand Short-stem, have been, and are still,\r\npopular, especially at the South. At present probably more than\r\nthree-fourths of the cauliflowers grown in this country are of the new\r\nvarieties of the Dwarf Erfurt group. For the North, especially, these\r\nare now the most reliable and are increasing in popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBROCCOLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Broccolis are so similar to the cauliflowers that some account of\r\nthem may be expected in a treatise on the latter vegetable. In fact, no\r\nimportant structural difference between the two vegetables exists, the\r\nbroccolis being merely a more robust and hardy group of varieties,\r\nrequiring a longer period for development, and adapted, in mild\r\nclimates, to cultivation during the winter. They are, in fact, often\r\ncalled \"winter cauliflowers.\" They receive but little attention in the\r\nUnited States, where the winters, at least at the north, in the vicinity\r\nof the leading markets, are too severe for the out-door growth of\r\nvegetables of any kind. For this reason cauliflowers, which come to\r\nmaturity in a single season, are grown instead. The supply of these two\r\nvegetables, therefore, which in western Europe, by means of successive\r\nsowings of varieties of both cauliflowers and broccolis, may be\r\nmaintained the year round, is here, owing to the conditions of our\r\nclimate, confined chiefly to the seasons of the year in which\r\ncauliflower can be obtained.\r\n\r\nAlthough no sharp distinctions can be drawn between broccolis and\r\ncauliflowers, there are certain general differences which separate\r\nthem. As has been said, the broccolis are all of them hardier than the\r\ncauliflowers, and require a longer time in which to develop, so that in\r\nclimates having mild winters they are usually treated as biennials. In\r\nFrance, the seed which is sown about the first of May gives plants which\r\nhead the following spring before the early cauliflowers come in. The\r\nplants are sometimes enabled to pass the winter more safely by being\r\ntaken up and planted again in a slanting position.\r\n\r\nIn the appearance of the heads no difference exists between cauliflowers\r\nand broccolis, except that the latter are usually smaller, less compact,\r\nand sometimes purple or sulphur colored. All cauliflowers (with one or\r\ntwo exceptions), have white compact heads. The stems of the broccolis\r\nare usually taller than those of cauliflowers, the leaves more numerous,\r\nlarger, stiffer, but more undulated, more rounded at the apex, and more\r\nfrequently having a distinct stem or petiole. The mid-ribs and principal\r\nveins are large and white, except in varieties having colored heads,\r\nwhen they have the same color as the head. The color of the leaves is\r\nalways more glaucous, that is, of a darker and more bluish green, than\r\nis usual in the cauliflowers.\r\n\r\nBroccolis, especially the colored varieties, are sometimes said to be\r\nmore tender in texture and finer in flavor than the cauliflowers. This,\r\nhowever, is due only to the fact that they usually head in cool weather.\r\nWhen grown under the same conditions the cauliflowers are milder than\r\nthe broccolis, and although to some tastes the more pronounced flavor of\r\nthe latter may be preferred, most persons use broccoli only because in\r\nthe winter season fresh cauliflowers cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\nNearly every one prefers cauliflower to broccoli, and the mild white\r\nvarieties to the colored varieties of the latter vegetable. Broccolis\r\nsometimes acquire a bitter taste, the cause of which is not known. The\r\nmethods of using the two vegetables are the same, except that the\r\nbranching or sprouting broccolis are also cooked like asparagus.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the broccoli has already been treated in connection\r\nwith that of the cauliflower.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties of broccoli in cultivation is probably somewhat\r\nless than those of the cauliflower, but the differences between the\r\nvarieties themselves are greater. Messrs. Sutton & Sons, of Reading,\r\nEngland, catalogue thirty-six varieties of broccoli and only eleven of\r\ncauliflower. Most of these varieties originated in England, where\r\nbroccoli is more largely grown than anywhere else. Two groups of\r\nbroccolis may be recognized, the \"sprouting broccolis,\" which do not\r\nform compact heads, and the improved varieties with well formed heads,\r\nknown as \"cauliflower broccolis.\" The latter differ but little in any\r\nway from true cauliflowers.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of cultivation for the broccolis are practically the\r\nsame as those for cauliflowers. Their value depends mainly on their\r\ngreater hardiness, and on this account they are likely, at the South\r\nwhere the winters are mild enough, to become more extensively\r\ncultivated. They do not, however, endure hot weather as well as\r\ncauliflowers, and on this account it is doubtful if they ever become as\r\nlargely grown anywhere in this country as they are in England.\r\n\r\nThe question of protecting them in winter, and the amount and kind of\r\nprotection needed, depend of course on the severity of the winters. In\r\nNorthern Florida, where cauliflowers are liable to be killed during\r\nwinter, broccolis will stand out without any protection. In localities\r\nwhere but little protection is required, it may be afforded by loosening\r\nthe roots and turning the plants down upon their sides. If more\r\nprotection is needed they may be taken up and set in trenches and partly\r\ncovered with straw and boards. Broccolis stand shipment better than\r\ncauliflowers. This is not only because they are generally handled in\r\ncolder weather, but because they are somewhat coarser and firmer in\r\ntexture. They do not sell for quite so good a price as cauliflowers.\r\nThere are seven varieties catalogued by American seedsmen, of which the\r\nEarly Purple Cape is the best adapted to our climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOOKING CAULIFLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Of all the flowers in the garden, I like the Cauliflower\r\n    best.\" DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson appreciated good living, and therefore it is not surprising\r\nthat he should have left on record this tribute to the most delicate and\r\nfinely flavored of all the cabbage family.\r\n\r\nCauliflower is so rarely seen in market in the United States, except in\r\nlarge cities, that comparatively few of our people are accustomed to\r\nusing it. On this account a variety of receipts for cooking cauliflower\r\nare here given, in order to make the methods of using this excellent\r\nvegetable more widely known. Americans, especially, need to become\r\nfamiliar with its use; for to the English, French, and Germans, who have\r\nknown it in the Old World, it needs no introduction.\r\n\r\nCauliflower lends itself readily to both plain and fancy methods of\r\ncooking. It is easy of digestion, and is an especial favorite with those\r\nwho, from any reason, are unable to readily digest cabbage. Besides, it\r\nis more nutritious than the cabbage, and it is not exceeded in this\r\nparticular by any other garden vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe following tables show the comparative composition of fresh cabbage\r\nand cauliflower, and the composition of the ash of the latter. It will\r\nbe noticed that the percentage of ash and indigestible fibre is low in\r\nthe cauliflower, and the amount of nitrogenous and starchy matter high.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF CABBAGE AND CAULIFLOWER. (König's Nohrungsmittel, pp. 715,\r\n717).\r\n\r\n --------------------------+----------+-------------\r\n                           | Cabbage. | Cauliflower.\r\n --------------------------+----------+-------------\r\n Water                     |  89.97   |    90.87\r\n Nitrogenous bodies        |   1.89   |     2.48\r\n Fat                       |   0.20   |     0.34\r\n Sugar                     |   2.29   |     1.21\r\n Nitrogen free extract     |   2.58   |     3.34\r\n  (starch, dextrine, etc.) |          |\r\n Fiber                     |   1.84   |     0.91\r\n Ash                       |   1.23   |     0.83\r\n --------------------------+----------+-------------\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF CAULIFLOWER ASH.

As with cabbage, this odor is in some cases\r\nmore marked than in others, depending on the character of the soil, and\r\nthe quantity and nature of the manure used. A small piece of red pepper\r\nadded to the water in which cauliflower or cabbage is boiled prevents to\r\na large extent this unpleasant odor and improves their flavor. To\r\nobviate the \"strong\" flavor which these vegetables acquire when large\r\nquantities of stable manure are used the heads should be parboiled in\r\nthe morning of the day on which they are wanted. They are then put on a\r\nhair sieve and placed in the larder. Twenty minutes before they are\r\nwanted for the table they are to be reboiled steadily until the strong\r\ntaste is gone.\r\n\r\nWhen cauliflowers are preserved in a shed or cellar they often become\r\nmore or less wilted and strong in flavor, and can then be rendered\r\npalatable only by cutting them off from the stalks on the previous day\r\nand throwing them into cold, salted water, frequently changing it until\r\nthey are wanted; in this way the heads become plumped up, and the strong\r\ndisagreeable smell and taste which they have acquired is in some degree\r\nremoved; but even under the most careful treatment they lose their fine,\r\nwhite cauliflower color.\r\n\r\nTo remove any caterpillars or other insects which may have found\r\nlodgment in the cauliflower head it should be examined as carefully as\r\npossible, opening it a little if necessary. It should then be placed top\r\ndown in cold salt water for an hour; or, better still, in cold water and\r\nvinegar. This is believed to be particularly effective in dislodging any\r\ninsect life that may be present. If the heads seem badly infested,\r\nhowever, which they seldom are, the only safe way is to break them up\r\nbefore cooking.\r\n\r\nIn cooking the heads whole, which is a favorite method, care is needed\r\nnot to boil too long, so as to cause the head to come to pieces. To\r\nprevent any danger of breaking the head in cooking, it should be wrapped\r\nin cheese cloth or other similar material, in which it is to be handled.\r\n\r\nCauliflower is in season in this country from June until December, but\r\nis most abundant during the month of October. Those found in market\r\nduring the hottest summer months are apt to be dark in color, somewhat\r\nstrong in flavor, and filled with small leaves. Broccoli is cooked in\r\nnearly all cases precisely as cauliflower.\r\n\r\nPorcelain lined or similarly guarded pots should be used in which to\r\ncook these vegetables, as iron is liable to impart to them a dark color.\r\n\r\nThe use of earthenware vessels in which to cook vegetables of the\r\ncabbage tribe is recommended as follows by a writer in the _American\r\nGarden_:\r\n\r\n\"To have any of the Brassicæ in proper flavor we must go to the German\r\nhousewives and learn of them to cook cabbage, cauliflower, etc., in\r\nearthenware instead of metal. The German potters make stout boilers,\r\nlike huge bean-pots, that hold six or eight cabbages, for restaurant\r\ncooking, and they are quite a different vegetable treated in this way.\r\nTry the experiment; put a cabbage in a stone jar with plenty of water,\r\ncover tight and boil till tender. I think it does not take as long to\r\ncook in this way as in ordinary kettles, the steady mild heat softening\r\nthe tissues more steadily than the open boiling. And there is little or\r\nno smell to cabbage or onions cooked in a close stone pot in the oven. A\r\ncabbage baked in its own steam in such a pot and served with hot vinegar\r\nand butter is a high-flavored dish.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Rural New Yorker_ sums up the prime requirements in\r\ncooking cauliflower as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Four rules never to be deviated from may be laid down: first, that the\r\ncauliflower is to be soaked in salt and water for at least a half hour\r\nbefore cooking, in order to drive out any insects or worms that may be\r\nlurking among the flowerets; second, (if to be boiled) when ready for\r\ncooking the vegetable is to be plunged into salted, thoroughly boiling\r\nwater; third, it is not to be cooked a moment after it becomes tender;\r\nfourth, to be served as soon as done. Neglect of any of these points is\r\nsure to result in failure, while a careful following of them will give a\r\nwholesome, delicate dish, and one that will be eaten with gusto and\r\nremembered with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nA very simple method of serving cauliflower is with milk and butter,\r\nafter the manner of cabbage, but a more elaborate white sauce generally\r\naccompanies it. This is the familiar drawn butter sauce, to which may be\r\nadded a little vinegar or lemon juice, to give piquancy of flavor.\r\nSometimes this sauce is varied by adding milk or cream to the flour and\r\nbutter, when it is called \"cream sauce.\"\r\n\r\nThe receipts given below are chiefly from the following four recent\r\nworks on cookery:\r\n\r\n\"Good Living,\" by Sara Van Buren Brugière; G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York\r\nand London, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"The Buckeye Cook-Book\"; Buckeye Publishing Company, Minneapolis, 1887.\r\n\r\n\"Our Home Cyclopedia,\" by Edgar S. Darling; Mercantile Publishing\r\nCompany, Detroit, 1889.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book\"; Marshall's School of Cookery,\r\nLondon, 1888.\r\n\r\n1. BOILED (_Gardener's Text Book_).--The head should be cut\r\nwith most of the surrounding leaves attached, which are to be trimmed\r\noff when the time comes for cooking. Let it lie half an hour in salt\r\nand water, and then boil it in fresh water for fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, until a fork will easily enter the stem. Milk and water are\r\nbetter than water alone [a little sweet milk tends to keep the heads\r\nwhite]. Serve with sauce, gravy or melted butter.\r\n\r\n2. BOILED (_American Agriculturist_).--Boil in water, slightly\r\nsalted--never with meat. When tender, which will usually be with twenty\r\nminutes cooking, take up and drain and cover with drawn butter (white\r\nsauce, made with butter, flour and water) and serve hot. They are\r\nusually eaten without other addition, but some dress with pepper and\r\nvinegar--the same as they do cabbage.\r\n\r\n3. BOILED (_Good Living_).--Trim off the outside leaves,\r\nleaving one row around the flower. Cut an X in the stalk. Have a large\r\npot of boiling water on the fire. Add enough milk to whiten the water;\r\nalso one level teaspoonful of salt. The cauliflower should be left in\r\nvinegar and water for twenty to thirty minutes before boiling. This\r\nsystem is supposed to draw out any insects that may lurk within. Drain\r\nit thoroughly; tie it loosely in a piece of cheese-cloth large enough to\r\ncover it entirely. Put it into the boiling water, which must cover it\r\nwell. Let it boil until quite tender, but be careful that it does not go\r\nto pieces. As cauliflowers vary very much in size, only a general idea\r\nof the time required can be given. One of ordinary size will take about\r\nforty minutes, perhaps more. When cooked lift it out by the\r\ncheese-cloth, drain very thoroughly, and set in a round dish. Make a\r\ncream sauce (No. 42), pour it over the cauliflower, cover, and let it\r\nstand for a few minutes for the sauce to penetrate. Then serve. _Or_, if\r\na handsome specimen successfully boiled, serve it in a round dish with a\r\nwhite sauce (No. 41) served separately in a sauce-boat. Add a squeeze of\r\nlemon juice to the sauce before serving. Small cauliflowers will not\r\nrequire more than thirty minutes to boil.\r\n\r\n4. BOILED (_Buckeye Cook Book_).--To each two quarts of water\r\nallow a heaping teaspoon of salt; choose close and white cauliflower;\r\ntrim off decayed outside leaves, and cut stock off flat at bottom. Open\r\nflower a little in places to remove insects, which are generally found\r\naround the stalk, and let cauliflowers lie with head downward in salt\r\nand water for two hours previous to dressing them, which will\r\neffectually draw out all vermin. Then put in boiling water, adding salt\r\nin above proportion, and boil briskly for fifteen or twenty minutes over\r\na good fire, keeping saucepan uncovered. Water should be well skimmed,\r\nand when cauliflowers are tender, take up, drain, and if large enough,\r\nplace upright in a dish; serve with plain melted butter, a little of\r\nwhich may be poured over the flowers; or a white sauce may be used,\r\nmade as follows: Put butter size of an egg into saucepan, and when it\r\nbubbles stir in a scant half teacup of flour; stir well with an\r\negg-whisk until cooked; then add two teacups of thin cream, some pepper\r\nand salt. Stir it over the fire until perfectly smooth. Pour the sauce\r\nover the cauliflower and serve. Many let the cauliflower simmer in the\r\nsame sauce a few moments before serving.\r\n\r\nCauliflower is delicious served as a garnish around spring chicken, or\r\nwith fried sweet-breads, when the white sauce should be poured over\r\nboth. In this case it should be made by adding the cream, flour and\r\nseasoning to the little grease (half a teaspoon) that is left after\r\nfrying the chickens or sweet-breads.\r\n\r\n5. BAKED (_Buckeye Cook Book_).--Prepare as for boiling, and\r\nparboil five minutes; cut into pieces and put into a pie dish; add a\r\nlittle milk, season with salt, pepper and butter; cover with dry, grated\r\ncheese, and bake.\r\n\r\n6. STEAMED (_Mrs. M. P. A. Crozier_).--Lay the nicely prepared\r\ncauliflower head in the deep dish from which it is to be served at\r\ntable, sprinkle salt over it, place it in the steamer, cover closely,\r\nand steam till tender. Remove to the table, and pour over it rich, sweet\r\ncream, slightly salted and heated.\r\n\r\n7. STEWED (_Gardener's Chronicle_).--Cut up your cauliflower\r\ninto sprigs of convenient size to serve with a tablespoon, and throw\r\nthem into cold water an hour before cooking. To stew them, have a stout,\r\niron stewpan, white-enamelled inside--an ordinary tin saucepan or boiler\r\nwill hardly do. Put a large lump of butter into your stewpan as you set\r\nit over a gentle fire; instead of butter you may use the fat taken from\r\nthe top of cold roast meat gravy--that of beef or veal is preferable to\r\nthat of mutton. As the grease melts, stir into it an onion chopped very\r\nfine, and a little flour and water; continue stirring until the whole is\r\nnicely browned; then put in your sprigged cauliflower, adding only just\r\nenough water or broth to cook it; season lightly with pepper and salt,\r\nand a very light dust of grated nutmeg, if not disapproved; let it stew\r\ngently till perfectly tender; when done the gravy should be so reduced\r\nas to be no more in quantity than is wanted to serve as sauce with the\r\nvegetable; for this reason the salt must be used with great moderation,\r\notherwise, by concentration, the gravy would be converted into brine;\r\ntransfer the cauliflower from the stewpan to a hot dish, and pour the\r\nreduced gravy over it.\r\n\r\nNote that by this method nothing is lost. The natural and nutritive\r\njuices of the vegetable, the sugar and albumen, are retained instead of\r\nbeing drawn out and diluted by boiling in several pints of water, and\r\nconsequently wasted and thrown away. Note also that this receipt is\r\nfounded (like the directions for many other good dishes) on the\r\n_roux_--flour browned in butter--which is one of the grand elements in\r\nFrench cookery.\r\n\r\n8. STEWED (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_[E]).--Cauliflower butter, salt,\r\nsugar, two and one-third ounces of flour, half a pint of cream,\r\none-eighth of the soup from the cauliflower.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower is cut into pieces, boiled slightly in salted water,\r\ntaken out of the soup and put on a colander to drain. The butter and\r\nflour are baked together and thinned with the cream, and about the\r\nquantity of the soup above stated. The cauliflower is put into this\r\nsauce and again brought to a boil, whereupon it is served warm.\r\n\r\n9. ESCALLOPED (_Rural New Yorker_).--Place a layer of the\r\nparboiled flowerets in a pudding dish, and cover them with cream sauce\r\nenough to moisten, with the addition of a little grated cheese, usually\r\nParmesian; this is to be followed by another layer of this vegetable,\r\nand the whole covered with bread crumbs dotted with bits of butter.\r\n\r\n10. ESCALLOPED (_Buckeye Cook Book_).--Boil till tender, drain\r\nwell, and cut in small pieces; put in layers, with fine chopped egg,\r\nand this dressing: Half pint milk, thickened over boiling water, with\r\ntwo tablespoons flour and seasoned with two teaspoons salt, one of white\r\npepper and two tablespoons butter; put grated bread over the top; dot it\r\nwith small bits of butter and place it in the oven to heat thoroughly\r\nand brown. Serve in same dish in which it was baked. This is a good way\r\nto use common heads.\r\n\r\nA nicer way is to boil them, then place them whole in a buttered dish\r\nwith stems down. Make sauce with a cup of bread crumbs beaten to froth\r\nwith two tablespoons melted butter and three of cream or milk, one\r\nwell-beaten egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour this over the\r\ncauliflower, cover dish tightly, and bake six minutes in a quick oven,\r\nbrowning them nicely. Serve as above.\r\n\r\n11. WITH STUFFING (_Home Cyclopedia_).--Take a saucepan, the\r\nexact size of the dish intended to be used. Cleanse a large, firm, white\r\ncauliflower, and cut into sprigs, throw those into boiling salt water\r\nfor two minutes; then take them out, drain, and pack them tightly with\r\nthe heads downward, in the saucepan, the bottom of which must have been\r\npreviously covered with thin slices of bacon; fill up the vacant spaces\r\nwith a stuffing made of three tablespoonfuls of finely minced veal, the\r\nsame of beef suet, four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, a little pepper\r\nand salt, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of minced\r\nchives and a dozen small mushrooms, chopped fine. Strew these\r\ningredients over the cauliflowers in alternate layers and pour over them\r\nthree well-beaten eggs. When these are well soaked add sufficient\r\nnicely-flavored stock to cover the whole; simmer gently till the\r\ncauliflowers are tender, and the sauce very much reduced; then turn the\r\ncontents of the saucepan upside down on a hot dish, and the cauliflowers\r\nwill be found standing in a savory mixture.\r\n\r\n12. WITH SAUCE (_Home Cyclopedia_).--Boil a large\r\ncauliflower--tied in netting--in hot salted water, from twenty-five to\r\nthirty minutes; drain, serve in a deep dish with the flower upwards, and\r\npour over it a cup of drawn butter in which has been stirred the juice\r\nof a lemon and a half teaspoonful of French mustard, mixed up well with\r\nthe sauce.\r\n\r\n13. WITH CURRY SAUCE (_Mrs. Marshall_).--Blanch (see note to\r\nNo. 19) and plain boil the cauliflower for fifteen to twenty minutes\r\ntill tender, then cut it up into nice long pieces, each sufficient for\r\none person; place the pieces in a sauté pan and pour the curry sauce (as\r\nfor curry _á la simla_) over them; let it boil up, and then draw the pan\r\nto the side of the stove and let it stay there for ten or twelve\r\nminutes; dish the pieces up in the form of cutlets, pour the sauce over\r\nthem, and garnish round the cauliflower with little bunches of grated\r\ncocoanut which have been warmed between two plates over boiling water.\r\nThis is an excellent dish for luncheon or second course, or it may be\r\nserved in place of an entrée.\r\n\r\n14. WITH TOMATO SAUCE (_Good Living_).--Having boiled a\r\nmedium-sized cauliflower, very carefully as directed (No. 3) place it on\r\na round dish, after having thoroughly drained it. Have ready a rich\r\ntomato sauce (No. 40) pour it around (not over) the cauliflower, and\r\nserve as a separate course. This is a very pretty dish.\r\n\r\n15. WITH TOMATO SAUCE (_Good Health_).--Boil or steam the\r\ncauliflower until tender. In another dish prepare a sauce by heating a\r\npint of strained stewed tomatoes to boiling, thickening with a\r\ntablespoonful of flour, and salting to taste. When the cauliflower is\r\ntender, dish, and pour over it the hot tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n16. WITH MUSHROOMS (_Buckeye Cook Book_).--Put in a frying pan,\r\nin hot fat, a few small mushrooms and part of a cauliflower, broken into\r\nsprigs. Sprinkle over them some grated cheese, and baste the whole well\r\nfrom time to time with the hot fat.\r\n\r\n17. WITH BRUSSELS SPROUTS (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_).--Cauliflower,\r\nBrussels sprouts, dotter of egg, butter, a tablespoonful of cream, half\r\na pint of sauce for vegetables, potato puré--that is, bouillon thickened\r\nwith mashed potatoes and strained.\r\n\r\nBoth cauliflower and sprouts are to be well cleaned, boiled separately\r\nin salt water and served on the puré, the cauliflower in the centre and\r\nthe sprouts around it for garnishing. The sauce, to which is added the\r\negg dotters, butter and cream, is poured hot over the cauliflower and\r\nsprouts.\r\n\r\n18. AU GRATIN (_Good Living_).--Boil the cauliflower as\r\ndirected. Set it in a round baking dish which can be sent to the table.\r\nFor a moderate sized cauliflower make one pint of cream sauce (No. 42).\r\nAdd to the sauce two heaping tablespoons each or grated Parmesian and\r\nGruyère cheese and a dash of cayenne. Mix the sauce and pour it over the\r\ncauliflower, letting it penetrate all the crevices. Cover the top with\r\nfine grated bread crumbs, dot with butter, and bake twenty minutes.\r\nServe in the same dish.\r\n\r\n19. AU GRATIN (_Mrs. Marshall_).--Trim the cauliflower and\r\nblanch it[F]; put it to boil in boiling water till it is tender; then\r\ntake up and drain. Butter the dish on which it is to be served and put\r\non it about two tablespoonfuls of the sauce as below (No. 39); put the\r\ncauliflower on the sauce, then cover it over thickly with sauce, and\r\nsmooth it all over with a palette knife; sprinkle it with browned bread\r\ncrumbs; stand the dish in an ordinary baking tin containing about a pint\r\nof boiling water; place in the oven for about fifteen or twenty minutes,\r\nand when a nice golden color take it from the oven and sprinkle over it\r\na very little grated Parmesian cheese. Stand the dish on another with a\r\nnapkin, and serve very hot as a second course or luncheon dish.\r\n\r\n20. AU GRATIN (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_).--Three cauliflower heads,\r\nsalt, pepper, grated bread, two eggs, one-quarter pound grated Parmesian\r\ncheese, one-quarter pound grated Swiss cheese, one pint white sauce.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflowers are boiled rare, taken out and drained off. White sauce\r\nand spices are boiled thick and the egg dotters and cheese mixed with\r\nit. The cauliflowers are cut to pieces and put in layers with sauce\r\nbetween, on a dish or silver saucepan, are sprinkled with grated bread\r\nand cheese, put fifteen minutes into a hot oven to be browned with a\r\nsalamander. Serve as an independent dish.\r\n\r\nIn place of \"white sauce\" butter and flour may be baked together and\r\nthinned with sweet milk.\r\n\r\n21. CAULIFLOWER AU NATUREL (_Mr. J. S. Soyer_).--The stem of\r\nthe white, solid cauliflower heads is cut off an inch from the head,\r\nand with a penknife is cleaned of the hard outer membrane, taking care\r\nto preserve the head as whole as possible; the head is then well rinsed\r\nin cold water, to which is added some vinegar to drive out larvæ and the\r\nlike; it is then boiled in salt water until it is tender, when it is\r\ntaken up to drain off on a sieve or colander. It is to be served high on\r\na napkin, with melted butter, common sauce for vegetables, Dutch sauce,\r\n_velouté_ or _mâitre d'hôtel_ sauce.\r\n\r\n    N. B.--For cauliflowers, and vegetables generally, the sauce\r\n    ought to be rather thick, as it is impossible to have the\r\n    vegetables run perfectly dry when they are to be served warm.\r\n\r\n22. Á LA FRANCAISE (_Home Cyclopedia_).--After trimming\r\nproperly, cut the cauliflower into quarters, and put into a stewpan and\r\nboil until tender; drain and arrange it neatly on a dish. Pour over it\r\nmelted butter.\r\n\r\n23. Á LA LOUIS XIV (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_).--Cauliflower, new-made\r\nbutter, grated nutmeg, bouillon.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower is to be repeatedly washed in lukewarm water, boiled\r\nwith bouillon and a little nutmeg, drained and then shaken with butter\r\nover a fire. To be served as soon as the butter is melted.\r\n\r\n24. Á LA VARENNE (_Mrs. Marshall_).--Trim a cauliflower, and\r\nplace it in salt and water for about one hour; then put it into cold\r\nwater with a pinch of salt; bring to the boil, and then rinse the\r\ncauliflower and put it again into boiling water which is seasoned with\r\nsalt, to cook till tender. When cooked, cut it in pieces and dish up in\r\na coil; pour parsley sauce over, and garnish it round with braised\r\ncarrots or a macedoine of vegetables, and place the cut up stalks of\r\ncauliflower in the centre. Serve for a luncheon or second course dish.\r\n\r\n25. EN MAYONNAISE (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_).--Two heads of\r\ncauliflower, salt, pepper, sweet oil, estragon, chopped parsley,\r\nvinegar, oil-sauce.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflowers are to be plucked apart and the stemlets cut off at\r\nproper lengths. Boil in water, and salt when nearly done. Drain off and\r\nlet cool, and then marinate for an hour with oil, vinegar, spices,\r\nestragon and parsley. Drain on a sieve. To be served high on a dish, and\r\noil sauce gradually to be poured over. If desired, the dish might be\r\ngarnished with carrots or some other suitable vegetable.\r\n\r\n26. SOUFFLE OF CAULIFLOWER, Á LA BARONNE (_Mrs.\r\nMarshall_).--Trim a nice cauliflower, put it to blanch (note to No. 19),\r\nthen rinse it and put it into boiling water with a little salt, and let\r\nit cook till tender; take up again, drain, and cut it in neat pieces and\r\nplace them in a buttered souffle dish with alternate layers of raw\r\nsliced tomatoes; season with a very little salt and white pepper, and\r\nfill up the dish with a souffle mixture prepared as below, and sprinkle\r\nover with a few browned bread crumbs; place a few pieces of butter here\r\nand there on the top, and bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes,\r\ndish upon a paper with a napkin round, sprinkle it with a little chopped\r\nparsley, and serve for second course or luncheon.\r\n\r\n_Mixture for Cauliflower Souffle._--Mix two ounces of butter, one and a\r\nhalf ounces of fine flour, one and a half raw yolks of eggs, tiny dust\r\nof cayenne, a saltspoonful of salt, with not quite half a pint of cold\r\nmilk; stir over the fire till it boils, then add three ounces of grated\r\nParmesian cheese and the whites of three eggs that have been whipped\r\nstiff, with a pinch of salt, and use.\r\n\r\n27. CAULIFLOWER SALAD (_Good Living_).--One pint cold boiled\r\ncauliflower, one teaspoon of chervil, chopped as fine as powder, one\r\nteaspoon of parsley, chopped as fine as powder, one teaspoon of tarragon\r\nor Maille vinegar, French dressing.\r\n\r\nBoil the cauliflower as directed (No. 3). Separate the flowerets, mix\r\nwith the parsley, chives and dressing. Set aside one hour. Serve very\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n_Another_ (_Buckeye Cook Book_).--After boiling, let cool and dress with\r\nMayonnaise, or any dressing preferred.\r\n\r\n28. CAULIFLOWER OMELETTE.--Take the white part of a boiled\r\ncauliflower after it is cold, chop it very small, and mix with it a\r\nsufficient quantity of well beaten egg to make a very thick batter; then\r\nfry it in fresh butter, in a small pan, and send to the table hot.\r\n\r\nNOTE:--This omelette makes a fine dressing to pour hot over\r\nfried chicken when ready to send to the table.\r\n\r\n29. CAULIFLOWER SOUP (_Mr. S. J. Soyer_). Two and a half quarts\r\nbouillon, one and a half pint milk, two or three cauliflowers, two and a\r\nhalf ounces butter, one and a half ounce flour, sugar, salt.\r\n\r\nThe cauliflowers are cleaned, and boiled almost ready, taken out and put\r\non a sieve, and the soup preserved. The butter and flour are baked\r\ntogether; and with the milk, bouillon, sugar and salt added to the\r\ndecoction from the cauliflowers. These are then cut into proper pieces\r\nand put into the soup, which is subjected to a quick boil and then\r\nserved with bread dumplings: crumbs of white bread moistened with milk,\r\nmelted butter, dotter of eggs, and the whites beaten to a stiff\r\nfroth--the mass rolled into balls, and boiled until they float.\r\n\r\n30. CAULIFLOWER CREAM SOUP (_Rural New Yorker_).--Boil the\r\ncauliflower in salt water until nearly done. For a small head, bring\r\nanother quart of water (or milk and water) to boil, adding half an\r\nonion, or a bit of spice if desired, and thicken it as for drawn butter\r\nsauce, with an ounce of butter and some flour. Boil the cauliflower in\r\nthe liquid until soft, then put the whole through a colander; return to\r\nthe fire, and add a cup of cream; simmer for five minutes, and serve at\r\nonce, with squares of fried bread.\r\n\r\n31. BROCCOLI (_American Garden_).--Broccoli is a pleasant\r\nchange from cabbage and cauliflower, either as a salad or a side dish.\r\nTo dress it, strip off the little branches, till the top one is left,\r\nthen with a sharp knife peel off all the hard skin on the stalks and\r\nbranchlets and throw them into water. When the water in the stewpan\r\nboils, put in the broccoli and cook till tender, salting in the last\r\nfive minutes. Serve with toast dipped in the broccoli water, laying the\r\nstalks over it, and eat with vinegar and melted butter. Or, let it get\r\ncold, cut in small bits, and serve as salad with oil and vinegar, with\r\nlemon juice, garnished with nasturtium buds. Or, serve a large round of\r\ntoast, the size of a dinner plate, moistened with broccoli water, salted\r\nand buttered, with nicely poached eggs laid on it, and sprigs of hot\r\nbroccoli set thickly between, dusting with fine salt. Cauliflower and\r\nsolid white cabbage may be served the same way.\r\n\r\n32. EGG BROCCOLI (_Home Cyclopedia_).--Take half a dozen heads\r\nof broccoli, cut off the small shoots or blossoms and lay them aside for\r\nfrying; trim the stalks short and pare off the rough rind up to the\r\nhead, wash them well and lay them in salt water for an hour, then put\r\nthem into plenty of boiling water (salted) and let them boil fast till\r\nquite tender. Put two ounces of butter into a saucepan, and stir it over\r\na slow fire till it is melted; then add gradually six or eight\r\nwell-beaten eggs and stir the mixture until it is thick and smooth. Lay\r\nthe broccoli in the center of a large dish, pour the egg around it, and,\r\nhaving fried the broccoli blossoms, arrange them in a circle near the\r\nedge of the dish.\r\n\r\n33. PICKLED (_Mrs. M. P. A. Crozier_).--Break at the natural\r\ndivisions, steam till tender, and place in a jar of cold vinegar with\r\nmustard and red peppers.\r\n\r\n34. PICKLED (_Gardener's Text Book_).--Place the heads in a\r\nkeg, and sprinkle them liberally with salt. Let them remain thus for\r\nabout a week, when you may turn over them scalding hot vinegar, prepared\r\nwith one ounce of mace, one ounce of peppercorns, and one ounce of\r\ncloves to every gallon. Draw off the vinegar, and return it scalding hot\r\nseveral times until the heads become tender.\r\n\r\n35. PICKLED (_Rural New Yorker_).--Break the heads into small\r\nsprays, throw them into a kettle of scalding brine; let them come to a\r\nboil, and drain carefully, so as not to break them; pack in stone or\r\nglass jars, and cover with scalding vinegar seasoned as follows: To one\r\ngallon of vinegar allow one cup of white sugar, half an ounce of mace,\r\none ounce of peppercorns, two or three red pepper pods broken into bits,\r\nand a tablespoonful each of coriander seed, celery seed, and white\r\nmustard. Pour this hot over the cauliflowers and seal at once. Glass\r\njars are the most convenient, as they may be examined frequently to see\r\nif their contents are keeping well. If not, repeat the scalding. In all\r\npickles the vinegar should be two inches or more above the vegetables,\r\nas it is sure to shrink, and if the vegetables are not thoroughly\r\nimmersed in vinegar they will not keep.\r\n\r\n36. PICKLED (_Home Cyclopedia_).--Choose such as are firm, yet\r\nof their full size; cut away all the leaves and pare the stalks; pull\r\naway the flowers in bunches, steep in brine two days, then drain them,\r\nwipe them dry, and put them in hot pickle, or merely infuse for three\r\ndays three ounces of curry powder in every quart of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Another._ Slice, salt for two or three days, drain, spread upon a dry\r\ncloth before the fire twenty-four hours; put in a jar and cover with\r\nspiced vinegar.\r\n\r\n37. MIXED PICKLES (_Home Cyclopedia_).--Three hundred small\r\ncucumbers, four green peppers, sliced fine, two large or three small\r\nheads of cauliflower, three heads of white cabbage sliced fine, nine\r\nlarge onions sliced, one large horseradish, one quart green beans cut\r\none inch long, one quart green tomatoes sliced; put this mixture in a\r\npretty strong brine twenty-four hours; drain three hours; then sprinkle\r\nin one-fourth pound black and one-fourth pound white mustard seed; also\r\none tablespoonful black ground pepper; let it come to a boil in just\r\nvinegar enough to cover it, adding a little alumn; drain again, and when\r\ncold put in one-half pint ground mustard; cover the whole with good\r\ncider vinegar; add turmeric enough to color if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSORY RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n38. CAULIFLOWER SAUCE (_Good Living_).--Use either white or\r\ncream sauce, adding to it the flowerets of cauliflower previously boiled\r\ntender. Serve with boiled fowl, veal sauté, etc.\r\n\r\n39. CAULIFLOWER SAUCE (_To accompany No. 19_).--One pint of\r\nthick Bechamel sauce, a quarter of a pound of grated Parmesian cheese,\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of grated Gruyère cheese, two tablespoonfuls of\r\ncream, a little dust of cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt; mix well\r\ntogether, and use.\r\n\r\n40. TOMATO SAUCE (_To accompany No. 14_).--\r\n\r\n 6 large tomatoes, or 1 can,\r\n Butter, size of an egg,\r\n Bunch of parsley or thyme,\r\n 1 tablespoonful of butter,\r\n 2 chopped onions,\r\n Salt and pepper,\r\n Pinch of sugar,\r\n 2 tablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n\r\nPeel the tomatoes, and put into a sauce pan with butter, thyme, onions\r\nand parsley (and 1 clove of garlic chopped and fried in butter). Set\r\nover boiling water and stew very gently for three hours. Then press\r\nfruit and juice all through a sieve, rejecting only the seeds and herbs.\r\nMeanwhile prepare a roux, allowing 1 quart of sauce, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nbutter, and 2 of flour, stirred together over the fire until light\r\ngolden brown--no darker, or the color of the sauce will be injured. When\r\nthe sauce is strained, remove the roux from the fire; stir in the sauce.\r\nReturn it to the fire. Stir and boil 3 to 5 minutes, until rich and\r\nthick. Should the sauce be already quite thick with the pulp of the\r\ntomatoes, use less thickening. If served with fricandeau, veal sauté, or\r\nfilet of beef, add the juices of the meat to the sauce.\r\n\r\n41. WHITE SAUCE (_To accompany No. 3, etc._)--\r\n\r\n 3 ounces of butter,\r\n 2 gills of water,\r\n 1 ounce of flour,\r\n Pepper and salt.\r\n\r\nPut 2 ounces of the butter in a stew pan; when it melts, add the flour.\r\nStir for 1 minute or more, but do not brown. Then add by degrees the\r\nboiling water, stirring until smooth; pass it through a sieve; then add\r\nthe rest of the butter, cut in pieces. When the butter is melted, serve\r\nimmediately. This makes about one pint of sauce. You may add as a great\r\nimprovement a little lemon juice or a few drops of vinegar.\r\n\r\nN. B.--If the sauce is to have other ingredients added it is best to\r\nhave it very thick to begin with.\r\n\r\n42. CREAM SAUCE (_To accompany Nos. 3 and 18_).\r\n\r\n 1 tablespoon of flour,\r\n 1 very large tablespoon of butter,\r\n 2 gills of new milk,\r\n ½ teaspoon of salt,\r\n Pepper to taste.\r\n\r\nPut ¾ of the butter in a sauce pan over the fire. As soon as it melts,\r\nadd the flour; stir till blended. Be careful not to let it brown. Add\r\nthe boiling milk, by degrees, to the flour and butter, stirring without\r\nceasing. Boil 3 minutes. Remove from the fire; add salt, white pepper,\r\nand the rest of the butter; stir until the butter melts, and serve\r\nimmediately. If it has to be kept, set it over a kettle of boiling\r\nwater; leave the spoon in it; and every now and again stir it down or\r\nthe top will form a scum. Do not let it boil after the last butter is\r\nadded. Cream may be used instead of new milk.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] Chief Cook at the Court of Denmark.\r\n\r\n[F] Blanching anything is placing it on the fire in cold water until it\r\nboils, and after straining it off plunging it into cold water for the\r\npurpose of rendering it white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following recapitulation of the more important points connected with\r\ncauliflower culture will serve to fix them in mind:\r\n\r\n1. The best localities for cauliflower growing are where the climate is\r\ncool and moist, as near some large body of water.\r\n\r\n2. The cauliflower will stand nearly as much dry weather as ordinary\r\ncrops while growing, providing it has a cool, moist time in which to\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n3. The best soil is a sandy loam, though any cool, moist, strong,\r\nfertile soil will answer.\r\n\r\n4. While a cool, moist soil is desirable, thorough drainage is quite as\r\nessential as with any other crop.\r\n\r\n5. An abundance of strong barn-yard or other manure is necessary, as the\r\ncauliflower is a gross feeder.\r\n\r\n6. Deep and frequent tillage, that there may be no check in growth until\r\nthe plants are nearly ready to head.\r\n\r\n7. Tie or pin the leaves over the heads as soon as they appear, to keep\r\nthem blanched and protect them from frost.\r\n\r\n8. If any plants have failed to head on the approach of winter, remove\r\nthem to a shed or cellar, and they will head there.\r\n\r\n9. Guard against the flea beetle, cut worm, cabbage worm and cabbage\r\nmaggot in the same manner as with cabbage.\r\n\r\n10. With suitable varieties and proper care the cauliflower can\r\ngenerally be successfully grown wherever the cabbage thrives\r\nparticularly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLIND.--To \"go blind\" is to lose the centre or growing point,\r\nand fail to head. It is generally due to climatic or insect injury. It\r\nis said to be frequently caused in the cauliflower by an insect\r\nresembling the turnip fly. Soot and lime are remedies.\r\n\r\nBLUES.--A dark-bluish appearance, accompanying arrested\r\ndevelopment, generally due to unfavorable weather, unsuitable soil or\r\ninsects at the root. Cabbage and cauliflower plants which are set too\r\nearly in the spring, especially if they are not well hardened off and\r\nare placed in a cold soil, are apt to assume this appearance. If\r\ncauliflowers remain long in this condition, they are liable either to\r\nfail to head, or to form small heads prematurely.\r\n\r\nBOLT.--A familiar term in England, applied to wheat when it\r\nheads out small and prematurely. Sometimes applied to cauliflowers when\r\nthey head before they attain a proper age and size. See _Button_.\r\n\r\nBREAK.--To become loose or \"frothy\" preparatory to running up\r\nto seed. Said of a head of cauliflower; also of other plants as they\r\nbegin to throw up their seed stalks.\r\n\r\nBUTTON.--TO form small heads prematurely, as often occurs when\r\nplants are left too long in the seed-bed.\r\n\r\nCURD.--The material composing the head of a cauliflower.\r\nSometimes the heads individually are called \"curds.\"\r\n\r\nDRAWN.--Having an abnormally long stem, owing to crowding, or\r\ntoo great heat, or too little light in the seed-bed.\r\n\r\nFLOWER OR BLOSSOM.--Terms often applied to the head in the\r\ncauliflower, either from its resemblance to a flower, or from a mistaken\r\nidea that it really is a flower.\r\n\r\nFLOWERET.--A term sometimes applied to one of the sprays or\r\nsub-divisions of a cauliflower head.\r\n\r\nFROTHY, see _Warty_.\r\n\r\nGLAUCOUS.--Pale bluish-green; sea-green.\r\n\r\nHEAD.--The edible part of a cauliflower, consisting of a mass\r\nof thickened flower-stems at an early stage of growth, before they have\r\nseparated and elongated preparatory to forming flowers and seeds.\r\nVarious other terms have been applied to it, such as \"flower\" or\r\n\"blossom,\" \"bouquet,\" \"heart,\" and, by the French, \"pomme\" (apple), but\r\nsometimes also \"tête\" (head).\r\n\r\nHEART, see _Head_.\r\n\r\nLEAFY.--Having the head interspersed with rather small leaves.\r\nA tendency to this condition is found in some inferior varieties, and\r\nin many good varieties when they head in hot weather.\r\n\r\nMOSSY.--Having numerous minute leaves distributed over the\r\nhead, giving it a \"mossy\" appearance. It is a condition of the same\r\nnature as the \"leafy\" state above mentioned, and produced by the same\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nROGUE.--An undesirable sport. A cauliflower which, unlike the\r\nothers in the field, runs immediately to seed without forming a head,\r\nwould be called a \"rogue.\"\r\n\r\nRUNNING.--Throwing up the flower-stalks preparatory to the\r\nproduction of seed. See _Break_.\r\n\r\nTURNING IN.--Commencing to head; a term originally applied to\r\ncabbages, but now extended to other plants which form heads of any kind.\r\n\r\nWARTY OR FROTHY.--A condition of the head in which the surface\r\nis covered with small prominences preparatory to running up to seed.\r\n\r\nWEATHER-PROUD.--An English term which signifies that plants are\r\nlarger or more thrifty than proper for the time of year. Applied, for\r\nexample, to wintered-over cauliflower plants during a warm, early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following works and articles certain points in connection with\r\nthe cauliflower and its cultivation are more fully treated than in the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nBON JARDINIER, (1859, p. 449).--A good article on the origin\r\nand varieties of the cauliflower, and its cultivation in France.\r\n\r\nBRILL, FRANCIS.--\"Cauliflowers and How to Grow Them,\" (16 pp.,\r\nprice twenty cents.

Peter\r\nHenderson said in 1867 that an acre of cauliflower was as much as could\r\nbe profitably sold from one garden in the New York market. Now, five to\r\nfifteen acres in a single field is not an uncommon sight on Long Island.\r\nIt is the business of the grower not only to supply the demand, but to\r\ncreate it. One way to increase the demand for cauliflower is to teach\r\nconsumers the best methods of using it. We believe that if cauliflower\r\ngrowers could distribute freely to their customers the information found\r\nin the chapter on cooking in this work on Cauliflower it would result in\r\nlargely increased sales. Accordingly we have reprinted this chapter as a\r\nseparate pamphlet and offer it to market gardeners and others at the\r\nfollowing very low rates: Single copies, ten cents, $5 per hundred.\r\nSample copy free upon request to any purchaser of this book.

Not only does\r\nit show the effects of careful selection, but the seeds were very large\r\nand full of vitality, germinated quick, and produced plants of uncommon\r\nvigor, healthy in all stages of growth. If the seed sent us is a fair\r\nsample you need not hesitate to claim that it is as good as any that can\r\nbe produced, as far as quality is concerned, and in vitality and\r\nconsequent vigor of plants excelling imported seed by 25 per cent.

The Puget Sound strain of Early Wakefield\r\nCabbage seed was so noticeably large that I weighed several samples of\r\nit and found that it averaged two and one-half times as large as the\r\nsame variety from other seedsmen. In the seed-box we obtained 97 plants\r\nfrom 100 seeds.\r\n\r\nThe plants were much stronger than those of any other variety.\r\nTwenty-five plants were put out, and every one formed a perfect head.\r\nThey were very even in size and shape, averaging slightly larger than\r\nour other strains, with three days difference in their favor in\r\nearliness.\r\n\r\n Very truly, L.
