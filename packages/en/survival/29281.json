F.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Attempt to account for the Production of a Shower of Stones,\r\n  that fell in Tuscany, on the 16th of June, 1794; and to shew that\r\n  there are Traces of similar Events having taken place, in the\r\n  highest Ages of Antiquity. In the course of which Detail is also\r\n  inserted, an Account of an extraordinary Hail-stone, that fell, with\r\n  many others, in Cornwall, on the 20th of October, 1791._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving received this last winter, from Sir Charles Blagden, some very\r\ncurious _manuscript_ accounts, concerning a surprising shower of stones;\r\nwhich is said, on the testimony of several persons, to have fallen in\r\nTuscany, on the 16th of June, 1794;--and having also perused, with much\r\nattention, a very interesting pamphlet, written in Italian, by _Abbate\r\nAmbrose Soldani_, Professor of mathematics, in the University of Siena,\r\ncontaining an extraordinary and full detail of such facts as could be\r\ncollected relating to this shower; the whole has appeared to me to\r\nafford such an ample field for philosophical contemplation, and also for\r\nthe illustration of antient historic facts; that (leaving the whole to\r\nrest upon such testimony as the learned Professor has already collected\r\ntogether; and to be supported by such further corroboration, as I am\r\ninformed is likely _soon_ to arrive in England,) I cannot but think it\r\ndoing some service to the cause of literature, and science, to give to\r\nthe world, in the earliest instance, a short abridgement of the\r\nsubstance of the whole of the information; expressed in the most concise\r\nand plainest language, in which it is possible for me to convey a full\r\nand exact idea of the phænomenon.\r\n\r\nIt may be of some use, and afford satisfaction to several curious\r\npersons, to find the whole here compressed in so small a compass.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I shall add my own conclusions without reserve; because the\r\nwhole of the phænomenon tends greatly to confirm some ideas which I had\r\npreviously been led to form, many years ago, concerning the\r\nconsolidation of certain species of stone; it may open a door for\r\nfurther curious investigation.\r\n\r\nAnd it may at least amuse, if not instruct; whilst I add a short detail\r\nof uncommon facts, recorded in antient history, and tending to shew\r\nclearly, that we are not without precedents of _similar events_ having\r\nhappened, in the early ages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of June, 1794, a tremendous cloud was seen in Tuscany, near\r\nSiena, and Radacofani; coming from the north, about seven o'clock in the\r\nevening;--sending forth sparks, like rockets;--throwing out smoke like a\r\nfurnace;--rendering violent explosions, and blasts, more like those of\r\ncannon, and of numerous muskets, than like thunder;--and casting down to\r\nthe ground hot stones:--whilst the lightning that issued from the cloud\r\nwas remarkably red; and moved with _less_ velocity than usual.\r\n\r\nThe cloud appeared of different shapes; to persons in different\r\nsituations; and remained suspended a long time: but every where was\r\nplainly seen to be burning, and smoking like a furnace.\r\n\r\nAnd its original height, from a variety of circumstances put together,\r\nseems to have been much above the common region of the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe testimony, concerning the falling of the stones from it, appears to\r\nbe almost unquestionable:--and is, evidently, from different persons,\r\nwho had no communication with each other.\r\n\r\nFor first; the fall of four stones is precisely ascertained: one of\r\nwhich was of an irregular figure, with a point like that of a\r\ndiamond;--weighed five pounds and an half;--and had a vitriolic\r\nsmell.--And another weighed three pounds and an half;--was black on the\r\noutside, as if from smoke;--and, internally, seemed composed of matter\r\nof the colour of ashes;--in which were perceived small spots of metals,\r\nof gold and silver.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides these, Professor Soldani of Siena, was shewn about fifteen\r\nothers: the surfaces of which were glazed black, like a sort of\r\nvarnish;--resisted acids;--and were too hard to be scratched with the\r\npoint of a penknife.\r\n\r\nSignior _Andrew Montauli_, who saw the cloud, as he was travelling,\r\ndescribed it as appearing much above the common region of the clouds;\r\nand as being clearly discerned to be on fire;--and becoming white, by\r\ndegrees; not only where it had a communication, by a sort of stream of\r\nsmoke and lightning, with a neighbouring similar cloud: but also, at\r\nlast, in two-third parts of its whole mass, which was originally black.\r\nAnd yet he took notice, that it was not affected by the rays of the sun,\r\nthough they shone full on its lower parts.--And he could discern as it\r\nwere the bason of a fiery furnace, in the cloud, having a whirling\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThis curious observer gives an account also, of a stone, which he was\r\nassured fell from the cloud, at the feet of a farmer; and was dug out of\r\nthe ground, into which it had penetrated.--And he says, that it was\r\nabout five inches long, and four broad; nearly square; and polished:\r\nblack on the surface, as if smoked; but within, like a sort of\r\nsand-stone, with various small particles of iron, and bright metallic\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nOther stones are described by him; which were said to have fallen at the\r\nsame time: were triangular; and terminated in a sort of (pyramidal) or\r\nconical figure.--And others were so small as to weigh not more than an\r\nounce.\r\n\r\nProfessor Soldani saw another stone, said to have fallen from the cloud,\r\nwhich had the figure of a parallelopiped, blunted at the angles; and was\r\nas it were varnished, on the outside, with a black crust; and quite\r\nunlike any stones whatever of the soil of the country where it had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nTwo ladies being at _Cozone_, about 20 miles from _Siena_, saw a number\r\nof stones fall, with a great noise, in a neighbouring meadow: one of\r\nwhich, being soon after taken up by a young woman, burnt her hand:\r\nanother burnt a countryman's hat: and a third was said to strike off the\r\nbranch of a mulberry tree; and to cause the tree to wither.\r\n\r\nAnother stone, of about two ounces weight, fell near a girl watching\r\nsheep; a young person, whose veracity it is said could not be\r\ndoubted.--This stone, the Professor tells us, is also a parallelopiped,\r\nwith the angles rounded; and its internal substance is like that of the\r\nothers; only with more metallic spots; especially when viewed with a\r\nmagnifying glass: and the black external crust appears to be minutely\r\ncrystallized.\r\n\r\nMany others, of a similar kind, were in the possession of different\r\npersons at Siena.\r\n\r\nAnd besides the falling of these from the cloud, there is described to\r\nhave been a fall of sand; seen by keepers of cattle near _Cozone_,\r\ntogether with the falling of what appeared like squibs; and which proved\r\nafterwards to be stones, of the sort just described, weighing two or\r\nthree ounces:--and some only a quarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\nAmongst other stones that fell; was one weighing two pounds, and two\r\nounces; which was also an oblong parallelopiped, with blunted angles,\r\n(as they are called, but which I think meant plainly prismatical\r\nterminations, and are said to have been about an inch in height;) and\r\nthis was most remarkable for having, a small circle, or sort of belt\r\nround it, in one part; wherein the black crust appeared more smooth; and\r\nshining like glass; as if that part had suffered a greater degree of\r\nheat than the rest.\r\n\r\nAnother, also, was no less remarkable, for having many rounded cavities\r\non its surface: as if the stone had been struck with small balls, whilst\r\nit was forming; and before it was hardened; which left their\r\nimpressions.--And some appearances, of the same kind, were found on one\r\nof the four surfaces of another stone, in the possession of Soldani.\r\n\r\nOn minute examination, the Professor found the stones were composed of\r\nblackish _crystals_, of different kinds; with metallic or pyritical\r\nspots, all united together by a kind of consolidated ashes.--And, on\r\npolishing them, they appeared to have a ground of a dark ash colour;\r\nintermixed with cubical blackish crystals, and shining pyritical specks,\r\nof a silver and gold colour.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which Professor Soldani evidently forms, is; _that the\r\nstones were generated in the air, by a combination of mineral\r\nsubstances, which had risen somewhere or other_, AS EXHALATIONS, _from\r\nthe earth_: but, as he seems to think, _not from_ Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThe names of many persons, besides those already referred to, are\r\nmentioned; who were eye witnesses to the fall of the stones. And several\r\n_depositions_ were made, _in a regular juridical manner_, to ascertain\r\nthe truth of the facts.\r\n\r\nThe space of ground, within which the stones fell, was from three to\r\nfour miles.\r\n\r\nThe falling of them, was _the very day after_ the great eruption of\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nAnd the distance of the place, from Vesuvius, could not be less than two\r\nhundred miles, and seems to have been more.\r\n\r\nVesuvius is situated _to the south_ of the spot: and the cloud came\r\n_from the north_; about thirteen, or at most eighteen hours, after the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nNow, putting all these circumstances together, I cannot but venture to\r\nform a conclusion, somewhat different from Professor Soldani's; though\r\nperfectly agreeing with his general principles.\r\n\r\nFrom a course of observations, and inquiries, which I have been led to\r\npursue, for a great many years: tending to elucidate the history of\r\nextraneous fossils, and of the deluge; I have long been convinced, that\r\nstones in general, and strata of rocks, of all kinds, have been formed\r\nby _two_ very different operations of those elements, which the wisdom,\r\nand omnipotent hand of God, has ordained, and created.\r\n\r\nThe one, by means of fire:--and the other, by means of water.\r\n\r\nAnd, of each sort, there are two subdivisions.\r\n\r\nOf the stones, and rocks, formed by fire;--there are some, (besides\r\nlavas,) whose component parts, having been previously fused, and in a\r\nmelted state, did merely cool, and harden _gradually_.\r\n\r\nAnd there are others; whose component parts, having been fused, and in a\r\nmelted state, and having so become completely liquid; did instantly, by\r\nthe operation of the powers of _attraction_, become crystallized.\r\n\r\nAnd, in like manner; of stones, and of strata of rocks, formed by means\r\nof water;--there are some, which having had their component parts\r\nbrought together, in a fluid state; did then merely become gradually\r\nsettled; and by the power of attraction, and the mixture of crystalline\r\nparticles, were hardened by degrees.\r\n\r\nAnd there are others: which, having had their component parts, in like\r\nmanner, brought together by water, did yet, on account of the peculiar\r\nnature, and more powerful _attraction_ of those parts, _instantly_\r\ncrystallize.\r\n\r\nAnd both of stones, and of strata of rocks, formed by fire; and of\r\nstones, and of strata of rocks formed by means of water; there are some\r\nsuch, as have been slowly consolidated by the first kind of operation;\r\nnamely by the gradual cooling or settling of the substances; which yet\r\ndo contain imbedded in them, crystals formed by the latter kind of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nInstances of which, we seem to have, in some granites, on the one\r\nhand;--and in some sorts of limestones on the other.\r\n\r\nTo this I must add also; that there appear further, to have been some\r\nstones formed _by a sort of precipitation_: much in the same manner as\r\n_Grew_ describes[A] the kernels, and stones of fruit to have been\r\nhardened.\r\n\r\nAnd I have met with many instances, wherein it appears unquestionably,\r\nthat all these kind of processes in nature are going on continually: and\r\nthat extraneous substances are actually inclosed, and _continually\r\ninclosing_, which could not be _antediluvian_; but must have been\r\nrecent.\r\n\r\nTo these short premises, I must beg leave to add; that in two papers\r\nformerly printed in the Philosophical Transactions,[B] I endeavoured, by\r\nsome very remarkable instances, to prove, that iron, wherever it comes\r\ninto combination with any substances that are tending to consolidation,\r\n_hastens the process exceedingly_;--and also renders the hardness of the\r\nbody much greater.\r\n\r\nAnd I have also endeavoured, elsewhere,[C] to shew, in consequence of\r\nconclusions deduced from experiments of the most unquestionable\r\nauthority, that _air_, in its various shapes and modifications, is\r\nindeed _itself_ the great consolidating fluid, out of which solid bodies\r\nare composed; and by means of which the various attractions take place,\r\nwhich form all the hard bodies, and visible substances upon earth.\r\n\r\nFrom all these premises then, it was impossible for me not to be led to\r\nconclude; that we have, in this august phænomenon of the fall of stones\r\nfrom the clouds, in Tuscany, an obvious proof, as it were before our\r\neyes, of the combined operation of those very powers, and processes, to\r\nwhich I have been alluding.\r\n\r\nIt is well known; that pyrites, which are composed of iron, and\r\nsulphur, and other adventitious matter, when laid in heaps, and\r\nmoistened, will take fire.\r\n\r\nIt is also well known, that a mixture of pyrites of almost any kind,\r\nbeaten small, and mixed with iron filings and water, when buried in the\r\nground will take fire; and produce a sort of artificial volcano. And,\r\nsurely then, wherever a vast quantity of such kind of matter should at\r\nany time become mixed together, as flying dust, or ashes; and be by any\r\nmeans condensed together, or compressed, the same effect might be\r\nproduced, even in the atmosphere and air.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of having recourse to the supposition, of the cloud\r\nin Tuscany having been produced by any other kind of exhalations from\r\nthe earth; we may venture to believe, that an immense cloud of ashes,\r\nmixed with pyritical dust, and with numerous particles of iron, having\r\nbeen projected from Vesuvius to a most prodigious height, became\r\nafterwards condensed in its descent;--took fire, both of itself, as well\r\nas by means of the electric fluid it contained;--produced many\r\nexplosions;--melted the pyritical, and metallic, and argillaceous\r\nparticles, of which the ashes were composed;--and, by this means, had a\r\nsudden crystallization, and consolidation of those particles taken\r\nplace, which formed the stones of various sizes, that fell to the\r\nground: _but did not harden the clayey ashes so rapidly as the metallic\r\nparticles crystallized_; and, therefore, gave an opportunity for\r\n_impressions to be made_ on the surfaces of some of the stones, as they\r\nfell, by means of the impinging of the others.\r\n\r\nNor does it appear to me, to be any solid objection to this conclusion,\r\neither that Vesuvius was so far distant; or that the cloud came from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nFor, if we examine Sir William Hamilton's account of the very eruption\r\nin question,[D] we shall find, that he had reason to conclude, that the\r\n_pine-like_ cloud of ashes projected from Vesuvius, at one part of the\r\ntime during this eruption, was twenty-five or thirty miles in height;\r\nand, if to this conclusion we add, not only that some ashes actually\r\nwere carried to a greater distance than _two hundred miles_;[E] but\r\nthat, when any substance is at a vast height in the atmosphere, a very\r\nsmall variation of the direction of its course, causes a most prodigious\r\nvariation in the extent of the range of ground where it shall fall;\r\n(just as the least variation in the angle, at the vertex of an\r\n_isosceles_ triangle, causes a very great alteration in the extent of\r\nits base;) we may easily perceive, not only the possibility, but the\r\nprobability, that the ashes in question, projected to so vast an height,\r\nwere first carried even beyond _Siena_ in Tuscany, northward; and then\r\nbrought back, by a contrary current of wind, in the direction in which\r\nthey fell.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton himself formed somewhat this sort of conclusion, on\r\nreceiving the first intimation of this shower of stones from the Earl of\r\nBristol.[F]\r\n\r\nI cannot therefore but allow my own conclusion to carry conviction with\r\nit to my own mind; and to send it forth into the world; as a ground, at\r\nleast, for speculation, and reflection, to the minds of others.\r\n\r\nThat ashes, and sand, and pyritical and sulphureous dust, mixed with\r\nmetallic particles from volcanoes; fit for the instantaneous\r\ncrystallization, and consolidation of such bodies as we have been\r\ndescribing, are often actually floating in the atmosphere, at incredible\r\ndistances from volcanoes, and more frequently than the world are at all\r\naware of, is manifest from several well attested facts.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, 1631, Captain _Badily_, being in the Gulph of\r\nVolo, in the Archipelago, riding at anchor, about ten o'clock at night,\r\nit began to rain _sand_ and _ashes_; and continued to do so till two\r\no'clock the next morning. The ashes lay about two inches thick on the\r\ndeck: so that they cast them overboard just as they had done snow the\r\nday before. There was no wind stirring, when the ashes fell: and yet\r\nthis extraordinary shower was not confined merely to the place where\r\n_Badily's_ ship was;[G] but, as it appeared afterwards, was extended so\r\nwidely to other parts, that ships coming from _St. John d'Acre_ to that\r\nport, being at the distance of _one hundred leagues_ from thence, were\r\ncovered with the same sort of ashes. And no possible account could be\r\ngiven of them, except that they might come from Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of October, 1755, a ship belonging to a merchant of Leith,\r\nbound for Charles Town, in Carolina, being betwixt Shetland and Iceland,\r\nand about twenty-five leagues distant from the former, and therefore\r\nabout three hundred miles from the latter, a shower of dust fell in the\r\nnight upon the decks.[H]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1762, at _Detroit_, in America, was a most surprising\r\ndarkness, from day-break till four in the afternoon, during which time\r\nsome rain falling, brought down, with the drops, sulphur and dirt;\r\nwhich rendered white paper black, and when burned fizzed like wet\r\ngunpowder:[I] and whence such matter could originally be brought,\r\nappeared to be past all conjecture, unless it came so far off as from\r\nthe volcano in Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\nCondamine says, the ashes of the volcano of _Sangay_, in South America,\r\nsometimes pass over the provinces of Maca, and Quito; and are even\r\ncarried as far as Guayaquil.[J]\r\n\r\nAnd Hooke says,[K] that on occasion of a great explosion from a volcano,\r\nin the island of Ternata, in the East Indies, there followed so great a\r\ndarkness, that the inhabitants could not see each other the next day:\r\nand he justly leads us to infer what an immense quantity of ashes must,\r\nby this means, have been showered down somewhere on the sea; because at\r\n_Mindanao_, an hundred miles off, all the land was covered with ashes a\r\nfoot thick.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I must add; that such kind of _falling of stones from the\r\nclouds_, as has been described to have happened in Tuscany, seems to\r\nhave happened also in very remote ages, of which we are not without\r\nsufficient testimony; and such as well deserves to be allowed and\r\nconsidered, on the present occasion; although the knowledge of the facts\r\nwas, at first, in days of ignorance and gross darkness, soon perverted\r\nto the very worst purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the Acts of the holy Apostles, we read, that the chief magistrate, at\r\n_Ephesus_, begun his harangue to the people, by saying, \"Ye men of\r\nEphesus, _what man is there that knoweth not how that the City of the\r\nEphesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the_ IMAGE\r\n_which fell down from Jupiter_?\" (or rather, as the original Greek has\r\nit) \"_of_ THAT _which fell down from Jupiter_?\" And the learned\r\n_Greaves_ leads us to conclude this image of Diana to have been nothing\r\nbut _a conical, or pyramidal stone_, that fell from the clouds. For he\r\ntells us,[L] on unquestionable authorities, that many others of the\r\nimages of heathen deities were merely such.\r\n\r\nHerodian expressly declares,[M] that the Phoenicians had no statue of\r\nthe sun, polished by hand, to express an image; but only had a certain\r\n_great stone, circular below, and ending with a sharpness above, in the\r\nfigure of a cone, of black colour. And they report it to have fallen\r\nfrom heaven, and to be the image of the sun_.\r\n\r\nSo Tacitus says,[N] that at Cyprus, _the image of Venus was not of human\r\nshape; but a figure rising continually round, from a larger bottom to a\r\nsmall top, in conical fashion_. And it is to be remarked, that _Maximus\r\nTyrius_ (who perhaps was a more accurate mathematician,) says, the stone\r\nwas _pyramidal_.\r\n\r\nAnd in Corinth, we are told by _Pausanias_,[O] that the images both of\r\n_Jupiter Melichius_, and of _Diana_, were made (if made at all by hand)\r\nwith little or no art. The former being represented by a pyramid, the\r\nlatter by a column.\r\n\r\n_Clemens Alexandrinus_ was so well acquainted with these facts, that he\r\neven concludes[P] the worship of such stones to have been the first, and\r\nearliest idolatry, in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to conceive how mankind should ever have been led to so\r\naccursed an abomination, as the worship of stocks, and stones, at all:\r\nbut, as far as any thing so horrid is to be accounted for, there is no\r\nway so likely of rendering a possible account; as that of concluding,\r\nthat some of these pyramidal stones, at least, like the image of\r\n_Diana_, actually did fall, in the earliest ages, from the clouds; in\r\nthe same manner as these pyramidal stones fell, in 1794, in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n_Plutarch_, it is well known, mentions[Q] a stone which formerly fell\r\nfrom the clouds, in _Thrace_, and which _Anaxagoras_ fancied[R] to have\r\nfallen from the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd it is very remarkable, that the old writer, from whom Plutarch had\r\nhis account, described the cloud, from which this stone was said to\r\nfall, in a manner (if we only make some allowance for a little\r\nexaggeration in barbarous ages,) very similar to _Soldani's_ account of\r\nthe cloud in Tuscany.--It hovered about for a long time; seemed to throw\r\nout splinters, which flew about, like wandering stars, before they fell;\r\nand at last it cast down to the earth a stone of extraordinary size.\r\n\r\nPliny,[S] who tells us that not only the remembrance of this event, but\r\nthat the stone itself was preserved to his days, says, it was of a dark\r\nburnt colour. And though he does indeed speak of it as being of an\r\nextravagant weight and size, in which circumstance perhaps he was\r\nmisled: yet he mentions _another_ of a moderate size, which fell in\r\n_Abydos_, and was become an object of idolatrous worship in that place;\r\nas was still _another_, of the same sort, at _Potidæa_.\r\n\r\n_Livy_, who like _Herodotus_, has been oftentimes censured as too\r\ncredulous, and as a relater of falsehoods, for preserving traditions of\r\n_an extraordinary kind_; which, after all, in ages of more enlarged\r\ninformation, have proved to have been founded in truth; describes[T] a\r\nfall of stones to have happened on mount _Alba_, during the reign of\r\n_Tullus Hostilius_, (that is about 652 years before the Christian æra),\r\nin words that exactly convey an idea of just such a phænomenon, as this\r\nwhich has so lately been observed in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nHe says, the senate were told, that _lapidibus pluisse_, it had rained\r\nstones. And, when they doubted of the fact; and sent to inquire; they\r\nwere assured that stones had actually fallen; and had fallen just as\r\nhail does, which is concreted in a storm.[U]\r\n\r\nHe mentions also shortly another shower of stones,[V] A. C. 202, and\r\nstill a third,[W] which must have happened about the year 194 before the\r\nChristian æra.\r\n\r\nSuch are the records of antient history. And in Holy Writ also a\r\nremembrance of similar events is preserved.\r\n\r\nFor when the royal Psalmist says,[X] \"_The Lord also thundered out of\r\nheaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones_, AND COALS OF\r\nFIRE,\"--the latter expression, in consistency with common sense, and\r\nconformably to the right meaning of language, cannot but allude to some\r\n_such_ phænomenon as we have been describing. And especially, as in the\r\ncautious translation of the seventy, a Greek word is used, which\r\ndecidedly means _real hard substances made red hot_; and not mere\r\nappearances of fire or flame.\r\n\r\nWhilst therefore, with the same sacred writer,[Y] we should be led to\r\nconsider all these powerful operations, as the works of God; _Who\r\ncasteth forth his ice like morsels_;[Z] and should be led to consider\r\n\"_fire and hail, snow and vapours, wind and storm as fulfilling his\r\nword_;\"[AA] we should also be led to perceive, that the objections to\r\nHoly Writ, founded on a supposed _impossibility_ of the truth of what is\r\nwritten in the book of _Joshua_,[BB] concerning the stones that fell\r\nfrom heaven, on the army of the Canaanites; are only founded in\r\nignorance, and error.\r\n\r\nAnd much more should we be led to do so; when, to these observations,\r\nand testimonies, concerning showers of hot burning stones, is added the\r\nconsideration; that within the short period of our own lives, incredibly\r\nlarge _real hail-stones_, formed of consolidated ice;--_of ice\r\nconsolidated in the atmosphere_, have fallen both in France, and in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn France, on the 13th of July in the year 1788;--of which it is well\r\nknown there has been a printed account: and concerning which it is said,\r\nand has been confirmed, on good authority, that some of the stones\r\nweighed three pounds: whilst others have been said to weigh even five\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nAnd in England, on the 20th of October, 1791, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nOf one of the hail-stones of this latter, minor storm, I have had an\r\nopportunity of obtaining, by the favour of a friend, an exact model in\r\nglass; whereof I now add an engraving.\r\n\r\nThis stone fell, with thousands of others of the same kind, near\r\n_Menabilly_, the seat of _Philip Rashleigh_, Esq.; well known for his\r\nscience, and attention to whatever is curious; who having great copper\r\nworks, and many ingenious miners, and workmen, on his estate, and\r\ndirectly under his eye; caused it to be instantly picked up: and having\r\nthen, himself, first traced both its top, and bottom, upon paper; and\r\nhaving measured its thickness in every part, with a pair of compasses;\r\ncaused a very exact mould to be formed: and afterwards, in that mould,\r\nhad this model cast in glass: wherein, also, the appearances of the\r\nimbedded, common, small, roundish hail-stones, are seen transparently;\r\njust as they appeared in the great hail-stone itself originally.\r\n\r\nFig. 1, is a representation of the flat bottom of the stone.\r\n\r\nFig. 2, is a representation of the top of the stone.\r\n\r\nAnd fig. 3, shews the whole solid appearance sideways.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mr. Rashleigh was taking the measures, it melted so fast, that he\r\ncould not, in the end, take the _exact weight_, as he fully intended to\r\nhave done. But as this model in glass weighs exactly 1 ounce, 16\r\npennyweights, 23 grains, we may fairly conclude, that the hail-stone\r\nitself weighed much above half an ounce.\r\n\r\nFor it is well known, that the specific gravity of common glass, of\r\nwhich sort this model is made, is to that of water, as 2.620 to 1.000.\r\nAnd the specific gravity of common water, is to ice, as 8 to 7.[CC]--And\r\ncomputing according to this standard, I make the exact weight of the\r\nhail-stone to have been 295 grains.\r\n\r\nFrom the singular manner in which the small, prior, common hail-stones\r\nappear to have been imbedded in this larger one, whilst they were\r\nfalling to the earth; there is reason to be convinced, that it was\r\nformed in the atmosphere, by a sudden extraordinary congelation _almost\r\ninstantaneously_, out of rain suddenly condensed, which was mingled with\r\nthe common hail.\r\n\r\nAnd it was very remarkable, that its dissolution, and melting, also, was\r\nmuch more rapid than that of the common small white hail-stones: as was\r\nthe case, in like manner, with the other numerous large ones.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it ought to be here added:--that on the 18th of May, in the year\r\n1680, some hail-stones are recorded to have fallen in London, near\r\n_Gresham college_, which were seen and examined by the celebrated _Dr.\r\nHooke_; and were some of them not less than two inches over, and others\r\nthree inches.\r\n\r\nThis which fell in Cornwall was only about one inch and three quarters\r\nlong; an inch, or in some parts an inch and a quarter broad; and between\r\nhalf an inch, and three quarters of an inch thick. And its weight was\r\nnear an ounce.--How much more tremendous then were those others, that\r\nhave been described as having fallen in France?--the accounts of some of\r\nthem may very probably have been exaggerated: but the reality was\r\nnevertheless as wonderful, surely, as any thing related concerning the\r\nages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nA proneness to credulity is ever blameable. And it is very possible,\r\nthat sometimes, in a very wonderful narration, a jest may be intended to\r\nbe palmed upon the world, instead of any elucidation of truth.--But\r\nfacts, _positively affirmed_, should be hearkened to with patience: and,\r\nat least, so far recorded, as to give an opportunity of verifying\r\nwhether similar events do afterwards happen; and of comparing such\r\nevents one with another.\r\n\r\nTo what has been said, therefore, concerning the fall of stones in\r\nTuscany, and concerning these strange showers of hail, in France, and in\r\nEngland, it might perhaps too justly be deemed an unwarrantable\r\nomission, on this occasion, not to mention the very strange fact that\r\nis affirmed to have happened the last year, near _the Wold Cottage_ in\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nI leave the fact to rest on the support of the testimonies referred to\r\nin the printed paper, which is in so many persons' hands; and that is\r\ngiven to those who have the curiosity to examine the stone itself, now\r\nexhibiting in London;--and shall only relate the substance of the\r\naccount shortly, as it is given to us.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the 13th of December, 1795, near the Wold Cottage,\r\nnoises were heard in the air, by various persons, like the report of a\r\npistol; or of guns at a distance at sea; though there was neither any\r\nthunder or lightning at the time:--two distinct concussions of the earth\r\nwere said to be perceived:--and an hissing noise, was also affirmed to\r\nbe heard by other persons, as of something passing through the air;--and\r\na labouring man plainly saw (as we are told) that something was so\r\npassing; and beheld a stone, as it seemed, at last, (about ten yards, or\r\nthirty feet, distant from the ground) descending, and striking into the\r\nground, which flew up all about him: and in falling, sparks of fire,\r\nseemed to fly from it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he went to the place, in company with others; who had\r\nwitnessed part of the phænomena, and dug the stone up from the place,\r\nwhere it was buried about twenty-one inches deep.\r\n\r\nIt smelt, (as it is said,) very strongly of sulphur, when it was dug up:\r\nand was even warm, and smoked:--it was found to be thirty inches in\r\nlength, and twenty-eight and a half inches in breadth. And it weighed\r\nfifty-six pounds.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account.--I affirm nothing.--Neither do I pretend either\r\nabsolutely to believe: or to disbelieve.--I have not an opportunity to\r\nexamine the whole of the evidence.--But it may be examined: and so I\r\nleave it to be.\r\n\r\nThis, however, I will say: that _first_ I saw a fragment of this stone;\r\nwhich had come into the hands of Sir Charles Blagden, from the Duke of\r\nLeeds: and afterwards I saw the stone itself.--That it plainly had a\r\ndark, black crust; with several concave impressions on the outside,\r\nwhich must have been made before it was quite hardened; just like what\r\nis related concerning the crusts of those stones that fell in\r\nItaly.--That its substance was not _properly_ of a _granite kind_, as\r\ndescribed in the printed paper; but a sort of _grit stone_; composed\r\n(somewhat like the stones said to have fallen in Italy) of sand and\r\nashes.--That it contained very many particles, obviously of the\r\nappearance of gold, and silver, and iron; (or rather more truly of\r\n_pyrites_).--That there were also several small rusty specks; probably\r\nfrom decomposed pyrites;--and some striated marks;--that it does not\r\neffervesce with acids;--and that, as far as I have ever seen, or known,\r\nor have been able to obtain any information, no _such_ stone has ever\r\nbeen found, before this time, in Yorkshire; or in any part of England.\r\nNor can I easily conceive that such a species of stone could be formed,\r\nby art, to impose upon the public.\r\n\r\nWhether, therefore, it might, or might not, possibly be the effect of\r\nashes flung out from _Heckla_, and wafted to England; like those flung\r\nout from Vesuvius, and (as I am disposed to believe) wafted to Tuscany,\r\nI have nothing to affirm.\r\n\r\nI wish to be understood to preserve mere records, the full authority for\r\nwhich, deserves to be investigated more and more.\r\n\r\nHaving, nevertheless, gone so far as to say thus much; I ought to add,\r\nthat the memorial of such sort of large stones having fallen from the\r\nclouds is still preserved also in Germany.\r\n\r\nFor one is recorded to have fallen in _Alsace_, in the midst of a storm\r\nof hail, November 29th, A. D. 1630;[DD] which is said to be preserved in\r\nthe great church of _Anxissem_: and to be like a large dark sort of\r\nflint-stone; having its surface operated upon by fire: and to be of very\r\nmany pounds weight.\r\n\r\nAnd another is said to be still preserved at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThis last is described by _Abbé Stutz_, Assistant in the Imperial\r\ncabinet of curiosities at Vienna, in a book printed in German, at\r\n_Leipsyc_, in 1790: entitled _Bergbaukimde_ (or _the Science of\r\nMining_.)\r\n\r\nAfter describing two other stones, said to have fallen from the clouds:\r\none in the _Eichstedt_ country in Germany; and another in the _Bechin_\r\ncircle, in Bohemia, in July, 1753; concerning the _real_ falling of\r\nwhich he had expressed some doubts; he proceeds to describe the falling\r\nof two, (whereof this was one,) not far from _Agram_, the capital of\r\n_Croatia_, in Hungary; which caused him to change his opinion; and to\r\nbelieve, that the falling of such stones from heaven, was very possible.\r\n\r\nHis words, fairly translated,[EE] in the beginning of his narrative,\r\nare, \"These accounts put me in mind of a mass of iron, weighing\r\nseventy-one pounds, which was sent to the imperial collection of natural\r\ncuriosities: about the origin of which _many mouths have been distorted\r\nwith scoffing laughter_. If, in the _Eichstedt_ specimen, the effects of\r\nfire appear _tolerably_ evident; they are, in this, not to be\r\nmistaken.--Its surface is full of spherical impressions, like the mass\r\nof iron, which the celebrated _Pallas_ found on the Jenisei river;\r\nexcept that here the impressions are larger, and less deep; and it\r\nwants both the yellow glass, which fills up the hollows of the\r\n_Siberian_ iron; and the _sand stone_, which is found in the _Eichstedt_\r\nspecimen; the whole mass being solid, compact, and black, like hammered\r\niron.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his words in the end of the narrative are,\r\n\r\n\"There is a great step from the disbelief of tales, to the finding out\r\nthe true cause of a phænomenon which appears wonderful to us. And\r\nprobably I should have committed the fault into which we so naturally\r\nfall, respecting things we cannot explain; and have rather denied the\r\nwhole history, than have determined to believe any thing _so\r\nincredible_; if various new writings, on electricity, and thunder, had\r\nnot fortunately, at that time come into my hands; concerning remarkable\r\nexperiments of reviving _metallic calces_ by the electric spark.\r\nLightning is an electrical stroke on a large scale.--If then the\r\nreduction of iron can be obtained, by the discharge of an electrical\r\nmachine; why should not this be accomplished as well, and with much\r\ngreater effect by the very powerful discharge of the lightning of the\r\nclouds?\"\r\n\r\nThe substance of the account of the fall of stones, in Hungary, as given\r\nby him, after the most accurate inquiries, is what I shall now add in\r\nthe following abridged detail; and it was verified by _Wolfgang\r\nKukulyewich, Spiritual vicar of Francis Baron Clobuschiczky, Bishop of\r\nAgram_, who caused seven eye witnesses to be examined, concerning the\r\nactual falling of these stones on the 26th of May, 1751;--which\r\nwitnesses were ready to testify all they affirmed, upon oath,--and one\r\nof them was Mr. George Marsich, Curate, as we should call him, of the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nAccording to their accounts; about six o'clock, in the afternoon of the\r\nday just mentioned, there was seen towards the east, a kind of fiery\r\nball; which, after it had burst into two parts, with a great report,\r\nexceeding that of a cannon, fell from the sky, in the form, and\r\nappearance of _two chains_ entangled in one another:--and also with a\r\nloud noise, as of a great number of carriages rolled along. And after\r\nthis a black smoke appeared; and a part of the ball seemed to fall in an\r\narable field of one _Michael Koturnass_; on the fall of which to the\r\nground a still greater noise was heard; and a shock perceived, something\r\nlike an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThis piece was afterwards soon dug out of the ground; which had been\r\nparticularly noted to be plain and level, and ploughed just before; but\r\nwhere it was now found to have made a great fissure, or cleft, an ell\r\nwide, whilst it singed the earth on the sides.\r\n\r\nThe other piece, which fell in a meadow, was also dug up; and weighed\r\nsixteen pounds.\r\n\r\nAnd it is fairly observed, that the unadorned manner in which the whole\r\naccount from _Agram_ is written; the agreement of the different\r\nwitnesses, who had no reason to accord in a lie; and the similarity of\r\nthis history to that of the _Eichstedt_ stone; makes it at least very\r\nprobable, that there was indeed something real, and worth notice, in the\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe _Eichstedt_ stone (somewhat like that said to have fallen so lately\r\nin Yorkshire) is described as having been composed of ash-grey sand\r\nstone, with fine grains intermixed all through it, partly of real native\r\niron, and partly of yellowish brown ochre of iron: and as being about as\r\nhard as building stone.--It is said not to effervesce with acids, and\r\nevidently to consist of small particles of siliceous stone and iron.--It\r\nhad also a solid malleable coat of native iron, as was supposed, quite\r\nfree from sulphur, and about two lines thick; which quite covered its\r\nsurface; resembling a blackish glazing. And the whole mass exhibited\r\nevident marks of having been exposed to fire.\r\n\r\nA plain testimony of the falling of this was affirmed to be, produced as\r\nfollows; that a labourer, at a brick-kiln, in winter, when the earth was\r\ncovered with snow, saw it fall down out of the air immediately after a\r\nviolent clap of thunder;--and that he instantly ran up to take it out of\r\nthe snow; but found he could not do so, on account of its heat; and was\r\nobliged therefore to wait, to let it cool. That it was about half a foot\r\nin diameter; and was entirely covered with a black coat like iron.[FF]\r\n\r\nAnd I must now add that there is a record;[GG] that stones, to the\r\nnumber of some hundreds, did once fall in the neighbourhood of a place\r\ncalled _Abdua_; which were very large and heavy;--of the colour of rusty\r\niron;--smooth, and hard;--and of a sulphureous smell:--and which were\r\nobserved to fall from a vehement whirlwind; that appeared (like that in\r\nTuscany) as an atmosphere of fire.\r\n\r\nHere I intended to have concluded all my observations. But a recent\r\npublication, which I knew not of, when these sheets were written,\r\nobliges me to add a few more pages.\r\n\r\nIn a very singular tract, published in 1794, at Riga, by Dr. _Chladni_,\r\nconcerning the supposed origin of the mass of iron found by Dr. Pallas\r\nin Siberia; which the Tartars still affirm to be _an holy thing_, and,\r\n_to have fallen from heaven_; and concerning what have been supposed, by\r\nhim, to be similar phænomena; some circumstances are also mentioned,\r\nwhich it would be an unjust omission not to take notice of shortly, on\r\nthe present occasion.\r\n\r\nWith the author's hypothesis I do not presume to interfere; but surely\r\nhis facts, which he affirms in support of his ideas, deserve much\r\nattention; and ought to be inserted, before I conclude these\r\nobservations: and the rather, as they were adduced to maintain\r\nconclusions very different from these now offered to the consideration\r\nof the curious.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, 1676, a fire ball was seen to come from\r\nDalmatia,[HH] proceeding over the Adriatic sea; it passed obliquely over\r\nItaly; where an hissing noise was heard; it burst SSW from Leghorn, with\r\na terrible report; _and the pieces are said to have fallen into the\r\nsea_, with the same sort of noise, as when red hot iron is quenched or\r\nextinguished in water. Its height was computed to be not less than\r\nthirty-eight Italian miles; and it is said to have moved with immense\r\nvelocity. Its form was oblong, at least as the luminous appearance\r\nseemed in its passage.\r\n\r\n_Avicenna_ mentions, (Averrhoes, lib. 2do Meteor. cap. 2.) that he had\r\nseen at Cordova, in Spain, a sulphureous stone that had fallen from\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nIn _Spangenberg_'s Chron. Saxon, an account is found, that at Magdeburg,\r\nin A. D. 998, two great stones, fell down in a storm of thunder: one in\r\nthe town itself; the other near the Elbe, in the open country.\r\n\r\nThe well known, and celebrated _Cardan_, in his book, _De Varietate\r\nRerum_, lib. 14. cap. 72. tells us, that he himself, in the year 1510,\r\nhad seen one hundred and twenty stones fall from heaven; among which\r\none weighed one hundred and twenty; and another sixty pounds. That they\r\nwere mostly of an _iron colour_, and very hard, and smelt of brimstone.\r\nHe remarks, moreover, that about three o'clock, a great fire was to be\r\nseen in the heavens; and that about five o'clock the stones fell down\r\nwith a rushing noise.\r\n\r\nAnd _Julius Scaliger_ (in his book _De Subtilitate Exerc._ p. 333.)\r\naffirms, that he had in his possession a piece of iron (as he calls it,)\r\nwhich had fallen from heaven in _Savoy_.\r\n\r\n_Wolf_ (in _Lection. Memorab._ Tom. II. p. 911.) mentions a great\r\ntriangular stone, described by _Sebastian Brandt_, (which seems to have\r\nbeen the identical stone I have already mentioned as having been\r\npreserved in the church of Anxissem,) and which was said to have fallen\r\nfrom heaven, in the year 1493, at Ensisheim or Ensheim.\r\n\r\n_Muschenbroek_,[II] speaking of the same stone, says, that the stone was\r\nblackish, weighed about 300lb. and that marks of fire were to be seen\r\nupon it; but apprehended (in which he seems to have been mistaken) that\r\nthe date of the fall was 1630.\r\n\r\n_Chladni_ also mentions another instance (from _Nic. Huknanfii_ Hist.\r\nHungar. lib. 20. fol. 394.) of five stones, said to have fallen from\r\nheaven at _Miscoz_, in Transylvania, in a terrible thunder storm and\r\ncommotion of the air, which were as big as a man's head, very heavy, of\r\na pale yellow, and iron, or rusty colour; and of a strong sulphureous\r\nsmell; and that four of them were kept in the treasury room at Vienna.\r\n\r\nHe adds, (from _John Binbard_'s Thuring. Chron. p. 193.) that on the\r\n26th of July, 1581, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, a\r\nstone fell down in _Thuringia_, with a clap of thunder, which made the\r\nearth shake; at which time a small light cloud was to be seen, the sky\r\nbeing otherwise clear. It weighed 39lb.; was of a blue and brownish\r\ncolour. It gave sparks, when struck with a flint, as steel does. It had\r\nsunk five quarters of an ell deep in the ground; so that the soil, at\r\nthe time, was struck up to twice a man's height; and the stone itself\r\nwas so hot, that no one could bear to touch it. It is said to have been\r\nafterwards carried to Dresden.\r\n\r\nHe adds, also, that in the 31st Essay of the Breslau Collections, p. 44,\r\nis found an account by Dr. _Rost_; that on the 22d of June, 1723, about\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon, in the country of Pleskowicz, some miles\r\nfrom _Reichstadt_, in Bohemia, a small cloud was seen, the sky being\r\notherwise clear; whereupon, at one place twenty-five, at another eight,\r\ngreat and small stones fell down, with a loud report, and without any\r\nlightning being perceived. The stones appeared externally black,\r\ninternally like a metallic ore, and smelt strongly of brimstone.\r\n\r\nAnd I shall conclude all _Chladni_'s remarkable facts, in addition to\r\nthose which I had myself collected, before ever I heard of his curious\r\nbook, with a short summary of what he calls one of the _newest_ accounts\r\nof this kind, extracted from the _Histoire de l'Académie des Sciences_,\r\n1769, p. 20.\r\n\r\nIt is an account of three masses, which fell down with thunder, in\r\nprovinces very distant from one another; and which were sent to the\r\nAcademy in 1769. They were sent from _Maine_, _Artois_, and _Cotentin_:\r\nand it is affirmed, that when they fell an hissing was heard; and that\r\nthey were found hot. All three were like one another; all three were of\r\nthe same colour, and nearly of the same grain; and small metallic and\r\npyritical particles could be distinguished in them; and, externally,\r\nall three were covered with an hard ferruginous coat: and, on chemical\r\ninvestigation, they were found to contain iron, and sulphur.[JJ]\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, all these facts so positively affirmed, concerning\r\nthese various, most curious phænomena:--the explosions;--the\r\nsparks;--the lights;--the hissing noises;--the stones seen to fall;--the\r\nstones dug up hot, and even smoking;--and some scorching, and even\r\nburning other bodies in their passage;--we cannot but also bring to\r\nremembrance, what Sir John Pringle affirmed to have been observed;\r\nconcerning a fiery meteor, seen on Sunday, the 26th of November, 1758,\r\nin several parts of England and Scotland.[KK]\r\n\r\nThat the head, which appeared about half the diameter of the moon, was\r\nof a bright white, like iron when almost in a melting heat;[LL] the\r\ntail, which appeared about 8° in length, was of a duskish red, burst\r\nin the atmosphere, when the head was about 7° above the horizon, and\r\ndisappeared; and in the room thereof were seen three bodies like stars,\r\nwithin the compass of a little more than three degrees from the head,\r\nwhich also kept descending with the head.\r\n\r\nThat before this, in another place, near Ancram in Scotland, (where the\r\nsame meteor was seen) one-third of the tail, towards the extremity,\r\nappeared _to break off_, and to separate into sparks, resembling\r\nstars.--That soon after this the body of the meteor had its light\r\nextinguished, with an explosion; but, as it seemed to the observer\r\nthere, _the form of the entire figure of the body, quite black, was\r\nseen to go still forwards in the air_.[MM] By some persons, also, an\r\nhissing noise[NN] was apprehended to be heard.\r\n\r\nWhether this might, or might not be an ignited body, of the kind we have\r\nbeen describing, falling to the earth, deserves consideration. Sir John\r\nPringle seems to have been convinced that it was really _a solid\r\nsubstance_; but fairly adds,[OO] that if such meteors had really ever\r\nfallen to the earth, there must have been, long ago, so strong evidence\r\nof the fact, as to leave no room to doubt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in the preceding accounts, we have such evidence, _now_ fairly\r\ncollected together; at least in a certain degree.\r\n\r\nI take all the facts, just as I find them affirmed. I have preserved a\r\nfaithful and an honest record.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of possible philosophical use;--let the philosophical, and\r\ncurious just preserve these facts in remembrance.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of philological advantage;--let the discerning weigh, and\r\njudge. For (if such things be,) what has so often come to pass,\r\naccording to what is commonly called _the usual course of nature_; may\r\nmost undoubtedly, henceforth, without any hesitating doubts, be believed\r\nto have been brought to pass, on an extraordinary occasion, in a still\r\nmore tremendous manner, by the immediate _fiat of the Almighty_.\r\n\r\nLet no man scoff; lest he drives away the means of real\r\ninformation.--And let all men _watch_, for the increase of science.--\r\n\r\nThe wisdom and power of God are far above not only the first\r\napprehensions, but even the highest ideas of man. And our truest wisdom,\r\nand best improvement of knowledge, consist in searching out, and in\r\nattending diligently, to what he has actually done: ever bearing in\r\nmind those words of the holy Psalmist.[PP]\r\n\r\n\"_The works of The Lord are great: sought out of all them that have\r\npleasure therein._\r\n\r\n\"_The Lord hath so done his marvellous works, that they ought to be\r\nhad in remembrance._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince these sheets were printed, I have received from Sir Charles\r\nBlagden, a present of one of the very small stones mentioned, p. 7, that\r\nare affirmed to have fallen in Tuscany; and which has very lately been\r\nbrought carefully from Italy.\r\n\r\nIts figure plainly indicates, that in the instant of its formation,\r\nthere was a strong effort towards crystallization. For it is an\r\nirregular quadrilateral pyramid;--whose base, an imperfect kind of\r\nsquare, has two of its adjoining sides about six-tenths of an inch long,\r\neach; and the other two, each about five-tenths: whilst two of the\r\ntriangular sides of the pyramid, are about six-tenths, on every side of\r\neach triangle, all of which are a little curved: and the other two\r\ntriangular sides, are only five-tenths on the sides where these two last\r\njoin.\r\n\r\nIts black crust, or coating, is such as has been described in the\r\npreceding pages: and is also remarkable, for the appearance of a sort of\r\nminute chequer work, formed by very fine white lines on the black\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] In his Anatomy of Plants, p. 41-184.\r\n\r\n[B] Vol. LXIII. p. 241--and Vol. LXIX. p. 35.\r\n\r\n[C] In the Morsels of Criticism, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[D] In the Philos.
