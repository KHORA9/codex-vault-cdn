MEEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion of the writer's paper, \"The Bracing of Trenches\r\nand Tunnels, With Practical Formulas for Earth Pressures,\"[B] certain\r\nminor experiments were noted in connection with the arching properties\r\nof sand. In the present paper it is proposed to take up again the\r\nquestion of earth pressures, but in more detail, and to note some\r\nfurther experiments and deductions therefrom, and also to consider the\r\nresistance and stability of earth as applied to piling and foundations,\r\nand the pressure on and buoyancy of subaqueous structures in soft\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this paper complete in itself, it will be necessary, in\r\nsome instances, to include in substance some of the matter of the former\r\npaper, and indulgence is asked from those readers who may note this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. SECTIONS OF BOX-FRAME FOR SAND-ARCH\r\nEXPERIMENT]\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 1._--As the sand-box experiments described in the former\r\npaper were on a small scale, exception might be taken to them, and\r\ntherefore the writer has made this experiment on a scale sufficiently\r\nlarge to be much more conclusive. As shown in Fig. 1, wooden abutments,\r\n3 ft. wide, 3 ft. apart, and about 1 ft. high, were built and filled\r\nsolidly with sand. Wooden walls, 3 ft. apart and 4 ft. high, were then\r\nbuilt crossing the abutments, and solidly cleated and braced frames were\r\nplaced across their ends about 2 ft. back of each abutment. A false\r\nbottom, made to slide freely up and down between the abutments, and\r\nprojecting slightly beyond the walls on each side, was then blocked up\r\nsnugly to the bottom edges of the sides, thus obtaining a box 3 by 4 by\r\n7 ft., the last dimension not being important. Bolts, 44 in. long, with\r\nlong threads, were run up through the false bottom and through 6 by 15\r\nby 2-in. pine washers to nuts on the top. The box was filled with\r\nordinary coarse sand from the trench, the sand being compacted as\r\nthoroughly as possible. The ends were tightened down on the washers,\r\nwhich in turn bore on the compacted sand. The blocking was then knocked\r\nout from under the false bottom, and the following was noted:\r\n\r\nAs soon as the blocking was removed the bottom settled nearly 2 in., as\r\nnoted in Fig. 1, Plate XXIV, due to the initial compacting of the sand\r\nunder the arching stresses. A measurement was taken from the bottom of\r\nthe washers to the top of the false bottom, and it was noted as 41 in.\r\n(Fig. 1). After some three or four hours, as the arch had not been\r\nbroken, it was decided to test it under greater loading, and four men\r\nwere placed on it, four others standing on the haunches, as shown in\r\nFig. 2, Plate XXIV. Under this additional loading of about 600 lb. the\r\nbottom settled 2 in. more, or nearly 4 in. in all, due to the further\r\ncompression of the sand arch. About an hour after the superimposed load\r\nhad been removed, the writer jostled the box with his foot sufficiently\r\nto dislodge some of the exposed sand, when the arch at once collapsed\r\nand the bottom fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 2, if, instead of being ordinary sand, the block\r\ncomprised within the area, _A U J V X_, had been frozen sand, there can\r\nbe no reason to suppose that it would not have sustained itself, forming\r\na perfect arch, with all material removed below the line, _V E J_, in\r\nfact, the freezing process of tunneling in soft ground is based on this\r\nwell-known principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, instead of removing the mass, _J E V_, it is allowed to remain\r\nand is supported from the mass above, one must concede to this mass in\r\nits normal state the same arching properties it would have had if\r\nfrozen, excepting, of course, that a greater thickness of key should be\r\nallowed, to offset a greater tendency to compression in moist and dry as\r\nagainst frozen sand, where both are measured in a confined area.\r\n\r\nIf, in Fig. 2, _E V J_ = [phi] = the angle of repose, and it be assumed\r\nthat _A J_, the line bisecting the angle between that of repose and the\r\nperpendicular, measures at its intersection with the middle vertical\r\n(_A_, Fig. 2) the height which is necessary to give a sufficient\r\nthickness of key, it may be concluded that this sand arch will be\r\nself-sustaining. That is, it is assumed that the arching effect is taken\r\nup virtually within the limits of the area, _A N_{1} V E J N A_, thus\r\nrelieving the structure below of the stresses due to the weight or\r\nthrust of any of the material above; and that the portion of the\r\nmaterial below _V E J_ is probably dead weight on any structure\r\nunderneath, and when sustained from below forms a natural \"centering\"\r\nfor the natural arch above. It is also probably true that the material\r\nin the areas, _X N_{1} A_ and _A N U_, does not add to the arching\r\nstrength, more especially in those materials where cohesion may not be\r\ncounted on as a factor. This is borne out by the fact that, in the\r\nexperiment noted, a well-defined crack developed on the surface of the\r\nsand at about the point _U_{1}_, and extended apparently a considerable\r\ndepth, assumed to be at _N_, where the haunch line is intersected by the\r\nslope line from _A_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV, FIG. 1.--INITIAL SETTLEMENT IN 3-FT. SAND\r\nARCH, DUE TO COMPRESSION OF MATERIAL ON REMOVING SUPPORTS FROM\r\nBOTTOM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV, FIG. 2.--FINAL SETTLEMENT OF SAND ARCH,\r\nDUE TO COMPRESSION IN EXCESS LOADING.]\r\n\r\nIn this experiment the sand was good and sharp, containing some gravel,\r\nand was taken directly from the adjoining excavation. When thrown\r\nloosely in a heap, it assumed an angle of repose of about 45 degrees. It\r\nshould be noted that this material when tested was not compacted as\r\nmuch, nor did it possess the same cohesion, as sand in its normal\r\nundisturbed condition in a bank, and for this reason it is believed that\r\nthe depth of key given here is absolutely safe for all except\r\nextraordinary conditions, such as non-homogeneous material and others\r\nwhich may require special consideration.\r\n\r\nReferring again to the area, _A N_{1} V J N A_, Fig. 2, it is probable\r\nthat, while self-sustaining, some at least of the lower portion must\r\nderive its initial support from the \"centering\" below, and the writer\r\nhas made the arbitrary assumption that the lower half of it is carried\r\nby the structure while the upper half is entirely independent of it,\r\nand, in making this assumption, he believes he is adding a factor of\r\nsafety thereto. The area, then, which is assumed to be carried by an\r\nunderground structure the depth of which is sufficient to allow the\r\nlines, _V A_ and _J A_, to intersect below the surface, is the lower\r\nhalf of _A N_{1} V E J N A_, or its equivalent, _A V E J A_, plus the\r\narea, _V E J_, or _A V J A_, the angle, _A V J_, being\r\n\r\n           1                                   [phi]\r\n[alpha] = --- ( 90° - [phi] ) + [phi] = 45° + -------.\r\n           2                                     2\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that these lines of thrust or pressure transmission,\r\n_A N_, _D K_, etc., will be straight, but, for purposes of calculation,\r\nthey will be assumed to be so; also, that they will act along and\r\nparallel to the lines of repose of their natural slope, and that the\r\nthrust of the earth will therefore be measured by the relation between\r\nthe radius and the tangent of this angle multiplied by the weight of\r\nmaterial affected. The dead weight on a plane, _V J_, due to the\r\nmaterial above, is, therefore, where\r\n\r\n    _l_ = span or extreme width of opening = _V J_,\r\n    _W_ = weight per cubic foot of material, and\r\n    _W_{1}_ = weight per linear foot.\r\n\r\n           2 × (_l_ / 2) tan. [alpha] × _W_\r\n_W_{1}_ = ---------------------------------- =\r\n                        2\r\n     1            / 1                       \\\r\n    --- _l_ tan. { --- (90° - [phi]) + [phi] } _W_ =\r\n     2            \\ 2                       /\r\n\r\n     _l_                [phi]\r\n    ----- tan. ( 45° + ------- ) _W_.\r\n      2                   2\r\n\r\nThe application of the above to flat-arched or circular tunnels is very\r\nsimple, except that the question of side thrust should be considered\r\nalso as a factor. The thrust against the side of a tunnel in dry sand\r\nhaving a flat angle of repose will necessarily be greater than in very\r\nmoist sand or clay, which stands at a much steeper angle, and, for the\r\nsame reason, the arch thrust is greater in dryer sand and therefore the\r\nload on a tunnel structure should not be as great, the material being\r\ncompact and excluding cohesion as a factor. This can be illustrated by\r\nreferring to Fig. 3 in which it is seen that the flatter the position of\r\nthe \"rakers\" keying at _W_{1}_, _W_{2}_, and _W_, the greater will be\r\nthe side thrust at _A_, _C_, and _F_. It can also be illustrated by\r\nassuming that the arching material is composed of cubes of polished\r\nmarble set one vertically above the other in close columns. There would\r\nthen be absolutely no side thrust, but, likewise, no arching properties\r\nwould be developed, and an indefinite height would probably be reached\r\nabove the tunnel roof before friction enough would be developed to cause\r\nit to relieve the structure of any part of its load. Conversely, if it\r\nbe assumed that the superadjacent material is composed of large bowling\r\nballs, interlocking with some degree of regularity, it can be seen that\r\nthose above will form themselves into an arch over the \"centering\" made\r\nup of those supported directly by the roof of the structure, thus\r\nrelieving the structure of any load except that due to this \"centering.\"\r\n\r\nIf, now, the line, _A B_, in Fig. 4, be drawn so as to form with _A C_\r\nthe angle, [beta], to be noted later, and it be assumed that it measures\r\nthe area of pressure against _A C_, and if the line, _C F_, be drawn,\r\nforming with _C G_, the angle, [alpha], noted above, then _G F_ can be\r\nreduced in some measure by reason of the increase of _G C_ to _C B_,\r\nbecause the side thrust above the line, _B C_, has slightly diminished\r\nthe loading above. The writer makes the arbitrary assumption that this\r\ndecrease in _G F_ should equal 20% of _B C_ = _F D_{1}_. If, then, the\r\nline, _B D_{1}_ be drawn, it is conceded that all the material within\r\nthe area, _A B D_{1} G C A_, causes direct pressure against or upon the\r\nstructure, _G C A_, the vertical lines being the ordinates of pressure\r\ndue to weight, and the horizontal lines (qualified by certain ratios)\r\nbeing the abscissas of pressure due to thrust. An extreme measurement of\r\nthis area of pressure is doubtless approximately more nearly a curve\r\nthan the straight lines given, and the curve, _A R T I D_{II}_, is\r\ntherefore drawn in to give graphically and approximately the safe area\r\nof which any vertical ordinate, multiplied by the weight, gives the\r\npressure on the roof at that point, and any horizontal line, or\r\nabscissa, divided by the tangent of the angle of repose and multiplied\r\nby the weight per foot, gives the pressure on the side at that point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe practical conclusion of this whole assumption is that the material\r\nin the area, _F E C B B_{1}_, forms with the equivalent opposite area an\r\narch reacting against the face, _C B B_{1}_ and that, as heretofore\r\nnoted, the lower half (or its equivalent, _B D_{1} G B_) of the weight\r\nof this is assumed to be carried by the structure, the upper half being\r\nself-sustaining, as shown by the line, _B_{III} D_{IV}_ (or, for\r\nabsolute safety, the curved line), and therefore, if rods could be run\r\nfrom sheeting inside the tunnel area to a point outside the line, _F\r\nB_{1}_, as indicated by the lines, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, etc., that\r\nthe internal bracing of this tunnel could be omitted, or that the tunnel\r\nitself would be relieved of all loading, whereas these rods would be\r\ncarrying some large portion at least of the weight within the area\r\ncircumscribed by the curve, _D_{II} I T G_, and further, that a tunnel\r\nstructure of the approximate dimensions shown would carry its maximum\r\nload with the surface of the ground between _D_{IV}_ and _F_, beyond\r\nwhich point the pressure would remain the same for all depths.\r\n\r\nIn calculating pressures on circular arches, the arched area should\r\nfirst be graphically resolved into a rectangular equivalent, as in the\r\nright half of Fig. 4, proceeding subsequently as noted.\r\n\r\nThe following instances are given as partial evidence that in ordinary\r\nground, not submerged, the pressures do not exceed in any instance those\r\nfound by the above methods, and it is very probable that similar\r\ninstances or experiences have been met by every engineer engaged in\r\nsoft-ground tunneling:\r\n\r\nIn building the Bay Ridge tunnel sewer, in 62d and 64th Streets,\r\nBrooklyn, the arch timber bracing shown in Fig. 1, Plate XXVI, was used\r\nfor more than 4,000 ft., or for two-thirds of the whole 5,800 ft. called\r\nfor in the contract. The external width of opening, measured at the\r\nwall-plate, averaged about 19 ft. for the 14½-ft. circular sewer and 19½\r\nft. for the 15-ft. sewer. The arch timber segments in the cross-section\r\nwere 10 by 12-in. North Carolina pine of good grade, with 2 in. off the\r\nbutt for a bearing to take up the thrust. They were set 5 ft. apart on\r\ncenters, and rested on 6 by 12-in. wall-plates of the same material as\r\nnoted above. The ultimate strength of this material, across the grain,\r\nwhen dry and in good condition, as given by the United States Forestry\r\nDepartment tests is about 1,000 lb. in compression. Some tests[C] made\r\nin 1907 by Mr. E.F. Sherman for the Charles River Dam in Boston, Mass.,\r\nshow that in yellow pine, which had been water-soaked for two years,\r\nchecks began to open at from 388 to 581 lb. per sq. in., and that yields\r\nof ¼ in. were noted at from 600 to 1,000 lb. As the tunnel wall-plates\r\ndescribed in this paper were subject to occasional saturation, and\r\nalways to a moist atmosphere, they could never have been considered as\r\nequal to dry material. Had the full loading shown by the foregoing\r\ncome on these wall-plates, they would have been subjected to a stress of\r\nabout 25 tons each, or nearly one-half of their ultimate strength. In\r\nonly one or two instances, covering stretches of 100 ft. in one case and\r\n200 ft. in another, where there were large areas of quicksand sufficient\r\nto cause semi-aqueous pressure, or pockets of the same material causing\r\neccentric loading, did these wall-plates show any signs of heavy\r\npressure, and in many instances they were in such good condition that\r\nthey could be taken out and used a second and a third time. Two\r\nespecially interesting instances came under the writer's observation: In\r\none case, due to a collapse of the internal bracing, the load of an\r\nentire section, 25 ft. long and 19 ft. wide, was carried for several\r\nhours on ribs spaced 5 ft. apart. The minimum cross-section of these\r\nribs was 73 sq. in., and they were under a stress, as noted above, of\r\n50,000 lb., or nearly up to the actual limit of strength of the\r\nwall-plate where the rib bore on it. When these wall-plates were\r\nexamined, after replacing the internal bracing, they did not appear to\r\nhave been under any unusual stress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV, FIG. 1.--NORMAL SLOPES AND STRATA\r\nOF NEWLY EXCAVATED BANKS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV, FIG. 2.--NORMAL SLOPES AND STRATA\r\nOF NEWLY EXCAVATED BANKS.]\r\n\r\nIn another instance, for a distance of more than 700 ft., the sub-grade\r\nof the sewer was 4 ft. below the level of the water in sharp sand. In\r\nexcavating for \"bottoms\" the water had to be pumped at the rate of more\r\nthan 300 gal. per min., and it was necessary to close-sheet a trench\r\nbetween the wall-plates in which to place a section of \"bottom.\" In\r\nspite of the utmost care, some ground was necessarily lost, and this was\r\nshown by the slight subsidence of the wall-plates and a loosening up of\r\nthe wedges in the supports bearing on the arch timbers. During this\r\noperation of \"bottoming,\" two men on each side were constantly employed\r\nin tightening up wedges and shims above the arch timbers. It is\r\nimpossible to explain the fact that these timbers slackened (without\r\nproportionate roof settlement) by any other theory than that the arching\r\nwas so nearly perfect that it relieved the bracing of a large part of\r\nthe load, the ordinary loose material being held in place by the arching\r\nor wedging together of the 2-in. by 3-ft. sheeting boards in the roof,\r\narranged in the form of a segmental arch. The material above this roof\r\nwas coarse, sharp sand, through which it had been difficult to tunnel\r\nwithout losing ground, and it had admitted water freely after each rain\r\nuntil the drainage of a neighboring pond had been completed, the men\r\nnever being willing to resume work until the influx of water had\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing applies only to material ordinarily found under ground not\r\nsubaqueous, or which cannot be classed as aqueous or semi-aqueous\r\nmaterial. These conditions will be noted later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe writer will take up next the question of pressures against the faces\r\nof sheeted trenches or retaining walls, in material of the same\r\ncharacter as noted above. Referring to Fig. 2, it is not reasonable to\r\nsuppose that having passed the line, _R F J_, the character of the\r\nstresses due to the thrust of the material will change, if bracing\r\nshould be substituted for the material in the area, _W V J R_, or if, as\r\nin Fig. 3, canvas is rolled down along the lines, _E G_ and _A O_, and\r\nif, as this section is excavated between the canvas faces, temporary\r\nstruts are erected, there is no reason to believe that with properly\r\nadjusted weights at _W_ or _W_{2}_, an exact equilibrium of forces and\r\nconditions cannot be obtained. Or, again, if, as in Fig. 5, the face,\r\n_P Q_, is sheeted and rodded back to the surface, keying the rods taut,\r\nthere is undoubtedly a stable condition and one which could not fail in\r\ntheory or practice, nor can anyone, looking at Fig. 5, doubt that the\r\ntop timbers are stressed more heavily than those at the bottom. The\r\nassumption is that the tendency of the material to slide toward the toe\r\ncauses it to wedge itself between the face of the sheeting on the one\r\nhand and some plane between the sheeting and the plane of repose on the\r\nother, and that the resistance to this tendency will cause an arching\r\nthrust to be developed along or parallel to the lines, _A N_, _B M_,\r\netc., Fig. 2, which are assumed to be the lines of repose, or curves\r\napproximating thereto. As the thrust is greatest in that material\r\ndirectly at the face, _A O_, Fig. 6, and is nothing at the plane of\r\nrepose, _C O_, it may be assumed arbitrarily that the line, _B O_,\r\nbisecting this angle divides this area into two, in one of which the\r\nweight resolves itself wholly into thrust, the other being an area of no\r\nthrust, or wholly of weight bearing on the plane of repose. Calling this\r\nline, _B O_, the haunch line, the thrust in the area, _A O B_, is\r\nmeasured by its weight divided by the tangent of the angle,\r\n_P Q R_ = [phi], which is the angle of repose; that is, the thrust at\r\nany given point, _R_ = _R Q_ ÷ tan. [phi].\r\n\r\nThe writer suggests that, in those materials which have steeper angles\r\nof repose than 45°, the area of pressure may be calculated as above, the\r\nthrust being computed, however, as for an angle of 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the bending moment against a wall or bracing, there is\r\nthe weight of the mass multiplied by the distance of its center of\r\ngravity vertically above the toe, or, approximately:\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\nArea, _A O B_ × weight per unit × --- height,\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nwhere _h_ = height,\r\n\r\n_W_ = weight per cubic foot of material = 90 lb.,\r\n\r\n              90° - [phi]\r\nand [beta] = -------------\r\n                  2\r\n\r\n_P_ = pressure per linear foot (vertically),\r\n\r\n                  _h_                         2\r\nthen _P_ = _h_ × ----- (tan. [beta]) × _W_ × --- _h_ =\r\n                   2                          3\r\n     1\r\n    --- _h^{3}_ _W_ tan. [beta].\r\n     3\r\n\r\nWhen the angle of repose, [phi], is less than 45°, this result must be\r\nreduced by dividing by tan. [phi]; that is,\r\n\r\n       1\r\n_h_ = --- _h^{3}_ tan. [beta] ÷ tan. [phi].\r\n       3\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2, Plate XXV, show recently excavated banks of gravel and\r\nsand, which, standing at a general angle of 45°, were in process of\r\n\"working,\" that is, there was continual slipping down of particles of\r\nthe sand, and it may be well to note that in time, under exposure to\r\nweather conditions, these banks would finally assume a slope of about 33\r\ndegrees. They are typical, however, as showing the normal slope of\r\nfreshly excavated sandy material, and a slope which may be used in\r\nordinary calculations. The steps seen in Plate XXV show the different\r\ncharacteristics of ground in close proximity. In Fig. 2, Plate XXVI,[D]\r\nmay be seen a typical bank of gravel and sand; it shows the well-defined\r\nslope of sand adjacent to and in connection with the cohesive properties\r\nof gravel.\r\n\r\nThe next points to be considered are the more difficult problems\r\nconcerning subaqueous or saturated earths. The writer has made some\r\nexperiments which appear to be conclusive, showing that, except in pure\r\nquicksand or wholly aqueous material, as described later, the earth and\r\nwater pressures act independently of each other.\r\n\r\nFor a better understanding of the scope and purpose of this paper, the\r\nwriter divides supersaturated or subaqueous materials into three\r\nclasses:\r\n\r\n_Class A._--Firm materials, such as coarse and fine gravels, gravel and\r\nsands mixed, coarse sands, and fine sands in which there is not a large\r\nproportion of fine material, such as loam, clay, or pure quicksand.\r\n\r\n_Class B._--Semi-aqueous materials, such as fine sands in which there is\r\na large proportion of clay, etc., pure clays, silts, peats, etc.\r\n\r\n_Class C._--Aqueous materials, such as pure quicksands, in which the\r\nsolid matter is so finely divided that it is amorphous and virtually\r\nheld in suspension, oils, quicksilver, etc.\r\n\r\nHere it may be stated that the term, \"quicksand,\" is so illusive that a\r\ntrue definition of it is badly needed. Many engineers call quicksand any\r\nsand which flows under the influence of water in motion. The writer\r\nbelieves the term should be applied only to material so \"soupy\" that its\r\nproperties are practically the same as water under static conditions, it\r\nbeing understood that any material may be unstable under the influence\r\nof water at sufficiently high velocities, and that it is with a static\r\ncondition, or one approximately so, that this paper deals.\r\n\r\nA clear understanding of the firm materials noted in Class A will lead\r\nto a better solution of problems dealing with those under Class B, as it\r\nis to this Class A that the experiments largely relate.\r\n\r\nThe experiments noted below were made with varying material, though the\r\nprincipal type used was a fine sand, under the conditions in which it is\r\nordinarily found in excavations, with less than 40% voids and less than\r\n10% of very fine material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 2._--The first of these experiments, which in this\r\nseries will be called No. 2, was simple, and was made in order to show\r\nthat this material does not flow readily under ordinary conditions, when\r\nnot coupled with the discharge of water under high velocity. A bucket 12\r\nin. in diameter, containing another bucket 9 in. in diameter, was used.\r\nA 6 by 6-in. hole was cut in the bottom of the inner bucket. About 3 in.\r\nof sand was first placed in the bottom of the larger bucket and it was\r\npartly filled with water. The inside bucket was then given a false\r\nbottom and partly filled with wet sand, resting on the sand in the\r\nlarger bucket. Both were filled with water, and the weight, _W_, Fig. 7,\r\non the arm was shifted until it balanced the weight of the inside bucket\r\nin the water, the distance of the weight, _W_, from the pivot being\r\nnoted. The false bottom was then removed and the inside bucket, resting\r\non the sand in the larger one, was partly filled with sand and both were\r\nfilled with water, the conditions at the point of weighing being exactly\r\nthe same, except that the false bottom was removed, leaving the sand in\r\ncontact through the 6 by 6-in. opening. It is readily seen that, if the\r\nsand had possessed the aqueous properties sometimes attributed to sand\r\nunder water, that in the inside bucket would have flowed out through the\r\nsquare hole in the bottom, allowing it to be lifted by any weight in\r\nexcess of the actual weight of the bucket, less its buoyancy, as would\r\nbe the case if it contained only water instead of sand and water. It was\r\nfound, however, that the weight, resting at a distance of more than\r\nnine-tenths of the original distance from the pivot, would not raise the\r\ninside bucket. On lifting this inside bucket bodily, however, the water\r\nat once forced the sand out through the bottom, leaving a hole almost\r\nexactly the shape and size of the bottom orifice, as shown in Fig. 1,\r\nPlate XXVII. It should be stated that, in each case, the sand was put in\r\nin small handfuls and thoroughly mixed with water, but not packed, and\r\nallowed to stand for some time before the experiments were tried, to\r\ninsure the compactness of ordinary conditions. It is seen from Fig. 1,\r\nPlate XXVII, that the sand was stable enough to allow the bucket to be\r\nput on its side for the moment of being photographed, although it had\r\nbeen pulled out of the water a little less than 3 min.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI, FIG. 1.--TYPES OF ARCH TIMBERS USED IN\r\nBAY RIDGE TUNNEL SEWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI, FIG. 2.--NORMAL SLOPE OF LOOSE SAND,\r\nGRAVEL, AND CEMENTED GRAVEL, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.]\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 3._--In order to show that the arching properties of\r\nsand are not destroyed under subaqueous conditions, a small sand-box,\r\nhaving a capacity of about 1 cu. ft., and similar to that described in\r\nExperiment No. 1, was made. The bottom was cut out, with the exception\r\nof a ¾-in. projection on two sides, and a false bottom was placed below\r\nand outside of the original bottom, with bolts running through it,\r\nkeying to washers on top of the sand, with which the box was partly\r\nfilled. One side of the box contained a glass front, in order that\r\nconditions of saturation could be observed. The box of sand was then\r\nfilled with water and, after saturation had been completed and the nuts\r\nand washers had been tightened down, the box was lifted off the floor.\r\nThere was found to be no tendency whatever for the bottom to fall away,\r\nshowing conclusively that the arching properties had not been destroyed\r\nby the saturation of the sand.\r\n\r\nThe next three experiments were intended to show the relative pressure\r\nover any given area in contact with the water in the one case or sand\r\nand water in the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 4._--The apparatus for this experiment consisted of a\r\n3-in. pipe about 4-in. long and connected with a ¾-in. goose-neck pipe\r\n17 in. high above the top of the bowl shown in Fig. 8 and in Fig. 2,\r\nPlate XXVII. A loose rubber valve was intended to be seated on the upper\r\nface of the machined edge of the bowl and weighted down sufficiently to\r\nbalance it against a head of water corresponding to the 17-in. head in\r\nthe goose-neck. The bowl was then to be filled with sand and the\r\ndifference, if any, noted between the weight required to hold the\r\nflap-valve down under the same head of water flowing through the sand.\r\nThe results of this experiment were not conclusive, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of making contact over the whole area of the sand and the rim\r\nof the bowl at the same time. At times, for instance, less than 1 lb.\r\nwould hold back the water indefinitely, while, again, 2 or 3 lb. would\r\nbe required as opposed to the 4½ lb. approximate pressure required to\r\nhold down the clear water. Again, at times the water would not flow\r\nthrough the neck at all, even after several hours, and after increasing\r\nthe head by attaching a longer rubber tube thereto. In view of these\r\nconditions, this experiment would not be noted here, except that it\r\nunexpectedly developed one interesting fact. In order to insure against\r\na stoppage of water, as above referred to, gravel was first put into the\r\nbottom of the bowl and the flap-valve was then rubbed down and held\r\ntightly while the pipe was filled. On being released, the pressure of\r\nwater invariably forced out the whole body of sand, as shown in Fig. 2,\r\nPlate XXVII. Care was taken to see that the sand was saturated in each\r\ncase, and the experiment was repeated numberless times, and invariably\r\nwith the same result. The sand contained about 40% of voids. The\r\ndeduction from this experiment is that the pressure of water is against\r\nrather than through sand and that any excess of voids occurring adjacent\r\nto a face against which there is pressure of water will be filled with\r\nsand, excepting in so far, of course, as the normal existing voids allow\r\nthe pressure of the water to be transmitted through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII, FIG. 1.--EXPERIMENT SHOWING PROPERTIES\r\nOF SAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII, FIG. 2.--SAND PUSHED UP FROM BOWL BY\r\nWATER PRESSURE THROUGH GOOSE-NECK.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the covering of sand over a structure is sufficiently heavy to\r\nallow arching action to be set up, the structure against which the\r\npressure is applied must be relieved of much of the pressure of water\r\nagainst the area of sand not constituted as voids acting outside of the\r\narching area. This is confirmed by the two following experiments:\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 5._--The same apparatus was used here as in Experiment\r\nNo. 2, Fig. 7, except that the inside bucket had a solid bottom. The\r\ninside and outside buckets were filled with water and the point was\r\nnoted at which the weight would balance the inside bucket at a point\r\nsome 3 in. off the bottom of the outside bucket. This point was\r\nmeasured, and the bottom of the larger bucket was covered over with sand\r\nso that in setting solidly in the sand the inside bucket would occupy\r\nthe same relative position as it did in the water. The same weight was\r\nthen applied and would not begin to lift the inner bucket. For instance,\r\nin the first part of the experiment the weight stood at 12 in. from the\r\npivot, while in the next step the weight, standing at the end of the\r\nbar, had no effect, and considerable external pressure had to be exerted\r\nbefore the bucket could be lifted. Immediately after it was relieved,\r\nhowever, the weight at 12 in. would hold it clear of the sand. No\r\nattempt was made to work the bucket into the sand; the sand was leveled\r\nup and the bucket was seated on it, turned once or twice to insure\r\ncontact, and then allowed to stand for some time before making the\r\nexperiment. No attempt was made to establish the relationship between\r\nsands of varying voids, the general fact only being established, by a\r\nsufficient number of experiments, that the weight required to lift the\r\nbucket was more than double in sand having 40% of voids than that\r\nrequired to lift the bucket in water only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 6._--The apparatus for this experiment consisted\r\nessentially of a hydraulic chamber about 8 in. in diameter and 1 ft.\r\nhigh, the top being removable and containing a collar with suitable\r\npacking, through which a 2½-in. piston moved freely up and down, the\r\nwhole being similar to the cylinder and piston of a large hydraulic\r\njack, as shown in Fig. 1, Plate XXVIII. Just below the collar and above\r\nthe chamber there was a ½-in. inlet leading to a copper pipe and thence\r\nto a high-pressure pump. Attached to this there was a gauge to show the\r\npressure obtained in the chamber, all as shown in Fig. 9. The purpose of\r\nthe apparatus was to test the difference in pressure on any object\r\nsubmerged in clear water and on the same object buried in the sand under\r\nwater. It is readily seen that, if pressure be applied to the water in\r\nthis chamber, the amount of pressure (as measured by the gauge)\r\nnecessary to lift the piston will be that due to the weight of the\r\npiston, less its displacement, plus the friction of the piston in the\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, FIG. 1.--APPARATUS FOR MEASURING LOSS\r\nOF PRESSURE IN SUBAQUEOUS MATERIALS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, FIG. 2.--RAISING ROOF OF BATTERY TUBES,\r\nIN BROOKLYN, BY \"BLEEDING\" SAND THROUGH DISPLACED PLATES.]\r\n\r\nNow, if for any reason the bottom area of the piston against which the\r\nwater pressure acts be reduced, it will necessarily require a\r\nproportionate amount of increase in the pressure to lift this piston.\r\nIf, therefore, it is found that 10 lb., for illustration, be required to\r\nlift the piston when plunged in clear water, and 20 lb. be required to\r\nlift it when buried in sand, it can be assumed at once that the area of\r\nthe piston has been reduced 50% by being buried in the sand, eliminating\r\nthe question of the friction of the sand itself around the piston. In\r\norder to determine what this friction might be, the writer arranged a\r\ntable standing on legs above the bottom of the chamber, allowing the\r\npiston to move freely through a hole in its center. Through this table\r\npipes were entered (as shown in part of Fig. 9). The whole was then\r\nplaced in the chamber with the piston in place, and the area above was\r\nfilled with sand and water. It is thus seen that, the end of the piston\r\nbeing free and in clear water, the difference, if any, between the\r\npressure required to lift the piston when in clear water alone and in\r\nthe case thus noted, where it was surrounded by sand, would measure the\r\nfriction of the sand on the piston. After several trials of this,\r\nhowever, it was clearly seen that the friction was too slight to be\r\nnoted accurately by a gauge registering single pounds, that is, with a\r\npiston in contact with 6 in. of sand vertically, a friction of 25 lb.\r\nper sq. ft. would only require an increase of 1.8 lb. on the gauge. It\r\nis therefore assumed that the friction on so small a piston in sand need\r\nnot be considered as a material factor in the experiments made.\r\n\r\nThe piston was plunged into clear water, and it was found that the\r\npressure required to lift it was about 4 lb. The cap was then taken off,\r\na depth of about 2 in. of sand was placed in the bottom of the chamber,\r\nand then the piston was set in place and surrounded by sand to a depth\r\nof some 6 in., water being added so that the sand was completely\r\nsaturated. This was allowed to stand until it had regained the stability\r\nof ordinary sand in place, whereupon the cap with the collar bearing was\r\nset in place over the piston, the machine was coupled up, and the pump\r\nwas started. A series of four experiments, extending over a period of\r\ntwo or three days, gave the following results:\r\n\r\n_Test 1._--The piston began to move at a pressure of 25 lb. The pressure\r\ngradually dropped to 7½ lb., at which point, apparently, it came out of\r\nthe sand, and continued at 7½ lb. during the remainder of the test.\r\n\r\n_Test 2._--The piston was plunged back into the sand, without removing\r\nthe cap, and allowed to stand for about 2 hours. No attempt was made to\r\npack the sand or to see its condition around the piston, it being\r\npresumed, however, that it had reasonable time to get a fair amount of\r\nset. At slightly above 20 lb. the piston began to move, and as soon as a\r\npocket of water accumulated behind the piston the pressure immediately\r\ndropped to 9 lb. and continued at this point until it came out of the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n_Test 3._--The piston was plunged into the sand and hammered down\r\nwithout waiting for the sand to come to a definite set. In this case the\r\ninitial pressure shown by the gauge was 17½ lb., which immediately\r\ndropped to 8 lb. as soon as the piston had moved sufficiently far to\r\nallow water to accumulate below it.\r\n\r\n_Test 4._--The cap was again removed, the piston set up in place, the\r\nsand compacted around it in approximately the same condition it would\r\nhave had if the sand had been in place underground; the cap was then set\r\nin place and, after an hour, the pump was started. The pressure\r\nregistered was 25 lb. and extended over a period of several seconds\r\nbefore there was any movement in the piston. The piston responded\r\nfinally without any increase of pressure, and, after lifting an inch or\r\ntwo, the pressure gradually dropped to 10 lb., where it remained until\r\nthe piston came out of the sand.\r\n\r\nThe sum and average of these tests shows a relation of 22 lb. for the\r\npiston in sand to about 8½ lb. as soon as the volume of water had\r\naccumulated below it, which would correspond very closely to a sand\r\ncontaining 40% of voids, which was the characteristic of the sand used\r\nin this experiment.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions from this experiment appear to be absolutely final in\r\nillustrating the pressure due to water on a tunnel buried in sand,\r\neither on the arch above or on the sides or bottom, as well as the\r\nbuoyant effect upon the tunnel bottom under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile the apparatus would have to be designed and built on a much larger\r\nscale in order to measure accurately the pressures due to sands and\r\nearths of varying characteristics, it appears to be conclusive in\r\nshowing the principle, and near enough to the theoretical value to be\r\ntaken for practical purposes in designing structures against water\r\npressures when buried in sand or earth.\r\n\r\nIt should be carefully noted that the friction of the water through\r\nsand, which is always a large factor in subaqueous construction, is\r\nvirtually eliminated here, as the water pressure has to be transmitted\r\nonly some 6 or 8 in. to actuate the base of the piston, whereas in a\r\ntunnel only half submerged this distance might be as many feet, and\r\nwould be a considerable factor.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted also that although the area subject to pressure is\r\ndiminished, the pressure on the area remaining corresponds to the full\r\nhydrostatic head, as would be shown by the pressure on an air gauge\r\nrequired to hold back the water, except, of course, as it may be\r\ndiminished more or less by friction.\r\n\r\nThe writer understands that experiments of a similar nature and with\r\nsimilar apparatus have been tried on clays and peats with results\r\nconsiderably higher; that is, in one case, there was a pressure of 40\r\nlb. before the piston started to move.\r\n\r\nThe following is given, in part, as an analysis and explanation of the\r\nabove experiments and notes:\r\n\r\nIt is well known that if lead be placed in a hydraulic press and\r\nsubjected to a sufficient pressure it will exhibit properties somewhat\r\nsimilar to soft clay or quicksand under pressure. It will flow out of an\r\norifice or more than one orifice at the same pressure. This is due to\r\nthe fact that practically voids do not exist and that the pressure is so\r\ngreat, compared with the molecular cohesion, that the latter is\r\nvirtually nullified. It is also theoretically true that solid stone\r\nunder infinitely high pressure may be liquefied. If in the cylinder of a\r\nhydraulic press there be put a certain quantity of cobblestones, leaving\r\na clearance between the top of the stone and the piston, and if this\r\nspace, together with the voids, be filled with water and subjected to a\r\ngreat pressure, the sides or the walls of the cylinder are acted on by\r\ntwo pressures, one almost negligible, where they are in contact with the\r\nstone, restraining the tendency of the stone to roll or slide outward,\r\nand the other due to the pressure of the water over the area against\r\nwhich there is no contact of stone. That this area of contact should be\r\ndeducted from the pressure area can be clearly shown by assuming another\r\ncylinder with cross-sticks jammed into it, as shown in Fig. 10. A glance\r\nat this figure will show that there is no aqueous pressure on the walls\r\nof the cylinder with which the ends of the sticks come in contact and\r\nthe loss of the pressure against the walls due to this is equal to the\r\nleast sectional area of the stick or tube either at the point of contact\r\nor intermediate thereto.\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, in Fig. 11 it is found that an equivalent area\r\nmay be deducted covering the least area of continuous contact of the\r\ncobblestones, as shown along the dotted lines in the right half of the\r\nfigure. Returning, if, when the pressure is applied, an orifice be made\r\nin the cylinder, the water will at once flow out under pressure,\r\nallowing the piston to come in contact with the cobblestones. If the\r\nflow of the water were controlled, so as to stop it at the point where\r\nthe stone and water are both under direct pressure, it would be found\r\nthat the pressures were totally independent of each other. The aqueous\r\npressure, for instance, would be equal at every point, while the\r\npressure on the stone would be through and along the lines of contact.\r\nIf this contact was reasonably well made and covered 40% of the area,\r\none would expect the stone, independently of the water, to stand 40% of\r\nthe pressure which a full area of solid stone would stand. If this\r\npressure should be enormously increased after excluding the water, it\r\nwould finally result in crushing the stone into a solid mass; and if the\r\npressure should be increased indefinitely, some theoretical point would\r\nbe reached, as above noted, where the stone would eventually be\r\nliquefied and would assume liquid properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe same general reasoning applies to pure sand, sand being in effect\r\ncobblestones in miniature. In pressing the piston down on dry sand it\r\nwill be displaced into every existing abnormal void, but will be\r\ndisplaced into these voids rather than pressed into them, in the true\r\ndefinition of the word, and while it would flow out of an orifice in the\r\nsides or bottom, allowing the piston to be forced down as in a\r\nsand-jack, it would not flow out of an orifice in the top of the piston,\r\nexcept under pressures so abnormally high as to make the mass\r\ntheoretically aqueous. If the positions of cylinder and piston be\r\nreversed, the piston pointing vertically upward and the sand \"bled\" into\r\nan orifice in or through it, the void caused by the outflow of this sand\r\nwould be filled by sand displaced by the piston pressing upward rather\r\nthan by sand from above.\r\n\r\nIt was the knowledge of this principle which enabled the contractors to\r\njack up successfully the roof of a long section of the cast-iron lined\r\ntubes under Joralemon Street in Brooklyn, in connection with the\r\nreconstruction of the Battery tubes at that point, the method of\r\noperation, as partly shown in Fig. 2, Plate XXVIII, being to cut through\r\na section of the roof, 4 by 10 ft. in area, through which holes were\r\ndrilled and through which again the sand was \"bled,\" heavy pressure\r\nbeing applied from below through the medium of hydraulic jacks. By a\r\ncareful manipulation of both these operations, sections of the roof of\r\nthe above dimensions were eventually raised the required height of 30\r\nin. and permanently braced there in a single shift.\r\n\r\nIf water in excess be put into a cylinder containing sand, and pressure\r\nbe applied thereto, the water, if allowed to flow out of an orifice,\r\nwill carry with it a certain quantity of sand, according to the\r\nvelocity, and the observation of this might easily give rise to the\r\nerroneous impression that the sand, as well as the water, was flowing\r\nout under pressure, and, as heretofore stated, has caused many engineers\r\nand contractors to apply the term \"quicksand\" to any sand flowing\r\nthrough an orifice with water.\r\n\r\nSand in its natural bed always contains some fine material, and where\r\nthis is largely less than the percentage of voids, it has no material\r\neffect on the pressure exerted by the sand with or without water, as\r\nabove noted. If, however, this fine material be largely in excess of the\r\nvoids, it allows greater initial compression to take place when dry, and\r\nallows to be set up a certain amount of hydraulic action when saturated.\r\nIf the base of the material be sand and the fill be so-called quicksand\r\nin excess of the voids, pressure will cause the quicksand to set up\r\nhydraulic action, and the action of the piston will appear to be similar\r\nto that of a piston acting on purely aqueous material.\r\n\r\nJust here the writer desires to protest against considering semi-aqueous\r\nmasses, such as soupy sands, soft concrete, etc., as exerting\r\nhydrostatic pressure due to their weight in bulk, instead of to the\r\nspecific gravity of the basic liquid. For instance, resorting again to\r\nthe illustration of cubes and spheres, it may be assumed that a cubical\r\nreceptacle has been partly filled with small cubes of polished marble,\r\npiled vertically in columns. When this receptacle is filled with liquid\r\naround the piles of cubes there will be no pressure on the sides except\r\nthat due to the hydrostatic pressure of the water at 62½ lb. The bottom,\r\nhowever, will resist a combined pressure due to the water and the weight\r\nof the cubes. Again, assume that the receptacle is filled with small\r\nspheres, such as marbles, and that water is then poured in. The pressure\r\ndue to the weight of the solids on the bottom is relieved by the loss in\r\nweight of the marbles due to the water, and also to the tendency of the\r\nmarbles to arch over the bottom, and while the pressure on the sides is\r\nincreased by this amount of thrust, the aqueous pressure is still that\r\nof a liquid at 62½ lb., and it is inconceivable that some engineers, in\r\ncalculating the thrust of aqueous masses, speak of it as a liquid\r\nweighing, say, 120 or 150 lb. per cu. ft.; as well might they expect to\r\nanchor spherical copper floats in front of a bulkhead and expect the\r\nhydrostatic pressure against this bulkhead to be diminished because the\r\nactual volume and weight of the water directly in front of the bulkhead\r\nhas been diminished. Those who have had experience in tying narrow deep\r\nforms for concrete with small wires or bolts and quickly filling them\r\nwith liquid concrete, must realize that no such pressures are ever\r\ndeveloped as would correspond to liquids of 150 lb. per cu. ft. If the\r\nsolid material in any liquid is agitated, so that it is virtually in\r\nsuspension, it cannot add to the pressure, and if allowed to subside it\r\nacts as a solid, independently of the water contained with it, although\r\nthe water may change somewhat the properties of the material, by\r\nincreasing or changing its cohesion, angle of repose, etc. That is, in\r\nsubstance, those particles which rest solidly on the bottom and are in\r\ncontact to the top of the solid material, do not derive any buoyancy\r\nfrom the water, while those particles not in contact with the bottom\r\ndirectly or through other particles, lose just so much weight through\r\nbuoyancy. If, then, the vertical depth of the earthy particles or sand\r\nabove the bottom is so small that the arching effect against the sides\r\nis negligible, the full weight of the particles in contact, directly or\r\nvicariously, with the bottom acts as pressure on the bottom, while the\r\nfull pressure of the water acts through the voids or on them, or is\r\ntransmitted through material in contact with the bottom.\r\n\r\nReferring now to materials such as clays, peats, and other soft or\r\nplastic materials, it is idle to assume that these do not possess\r\npressure-resisting and arching properties. For instance, a soft clay\r\narch of larger dimensions, under the condition described early in this\r\npaper, would undoubtedly stand if the rods supporting the intrados of\r\nthe arch were keyed back to washers covering a sufficiently large area.\r\n\r\nThe fact that compressed air can be used at all in tunnel work is\r\nevidence that semi-aqueous materials have arching properties, and the\r\nfact that \"blows\" usually occur in light cover is further evidence of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen air pressure is used to hold back the water in faces of large area,\r\nbracing has to be resorted to. This again shows that while full\r\nhydrostatic pressure is required to hold back the water, the pressure of\r\nthe earth is in a measure independent of it.\r\n\r\nIn a peaty or boggy material there is a condition somewhat different,\r\nbut sufficiently allied to the soft clayey or soupy sands to place it\r\nunder the same head in ordinary practice. It is undoubtedly true that\r\npiles can be driven to an indefinite depth in this material, and it is\r\nalso true that the action of the pile is to displace rather than\r\ncompress, as shown by the fact of driving portions of the tunnels under\r\nthe North River for long distances without opening the doors of the\r\nshield or removing any of the material. The case of filling in bogs or\r\nmarshes, causing them to sink at the point of filling and rise\r\nelsewhere, is readily explained by the fact that the water is confined\r\nin the interstices of the material, admitting of displacement but no\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nThe application of the above to pressures over tunnels in materials of\r\nClass A is that the sand or solid matter is virtually assumed to be a\r\nseries of columns with their bases in such intimate contact with the\r\ntunnel roof that water cannot exert pressure on the tunnel or buoyancy\r\non the sand at the point of contact, and that if these columns are\r\nsufficiently deep to have their upper portions wholly or partly carried\r\nby the arching or wedging action, the pressure of any water on their\r\nsurfaces is not transferred to the tunnel, and the only aqueous pressure\r\nis that which acts on the tunnel between the assumed columns or through\r\nthe voids.\r\n\r\nLet _l_ = exterior width of tunnel,\r\n    _d_ = depth of cover, as:\r\n\r\n      _D_{W}_ = depth, water to roof,\r\n      _D_{E}_ =   \"    earth to roof,\r\n      _D_{X}_ =   \"    of cover of earth necessary to arching stability,\r\n\r\nthat is:\r\n\r\n           _l_          / 90° - [phi] \\\r\n_D_{X}_ = ----- ( tan. { ------------- } + [phi] ) =\r\n            2           \\     2       /\r\n\r\n     _l_                [phi]\r\n    ----- tan.

FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nNext is the question of pressure against a wall or braced trench for\r\nmaterials under Class A. The pressure of sand is first calculated\r\nindependently, as shown in Fig. 6. Reducing this to a basis of 100 lb.\r\nfor each division of the scale measured horizontally, as shown, gives\r\nthe line, _B O_, Fig. 12, measuring the outside limit of pressure due to\r\nthe earth, the horizontal distance at any point between this line and\r\nthe vertical face equalling the pressure against that face divided by\r\nthe tangent of the angle of repose, which in this case is assumed to be\r\n45°, equalling unity. If the water pressure line, _C F_, is drawn, it\r\nshows the relative pressure of the water. In order to reduce this to the\r\nscale of 100 lb. horizontal measurement, the line, _C E_, is drawn,\r\nrepresenting the water pressure to scale, that is, so that each\r\nhorizontal measurement of the scale gives the pressure on the face at\r\nthat point; and, allowing 50% for voids, halving this area gives the\r\nline, _C D_, between which and the vertical face any horizontal line\r\nmeasures the water pressure. Extending these pressure areas where they\r\noverlap gives the line, _B D_, which represents the total pressure\r\nagainst the face, measured horizontally.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the question of buoyancy in Class A materials. If a\r\nsubmerged structure rests firmly on a bottom of more or less firm sand,\r\nits buoyancy, as indicated by the experiments, will only be a percentage\r\nof its buoyancy in pure water, corresponding to the voids in the sand.\r\nIn practice, however, an attempt to show this condition will fail, owing\r\nto the fact that in such a structure the water will almost immediately\r\nwork under the edge and bottom, and cause the structure to rise, and the\r\ntest can only be made by measuring the difference in uplift in a\r\nheavier-than-water structure, as shown in Experiment No. 5. For, if a\r\nstructure lighter than the displaced water be buried in sand\r\nsufficiently deep to insure it against the influx of large volumes of\r\nwater below, it will not rise. That this is not due entirely to the\r\nfriction of the solid material on the sides has been demonstrated by the\r\nobservation of subaqueous structures, which always tend to subside\r\nrather than to lift during or following disturbance of the surrounding\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe following is quoted from the paper by Charles M. Jacobs, M. Am. Soc.\r\nC. E., on the North River Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nTunnels:[E]\r\n\r\n     \"There was considerable subsidence in the tunnels during\r\n     construction and lining, amounting to an average of 0.34 ft.\r\n     between the bulkhead lines. This settlement has been constantly\r\n     decreasing since construction, and appears to have been due almost\r\n     entirely to the disturbances of the surrounding materials during\r\n     construction. The silt weighs about 100 lb. per cu. ft. * * * and\r\n     contains about 38% of water. It was found that whenever this\r\n     material was disturbed outside the tunnels a displacement of the\r\n     tunnels followed.\"\r\n\r\nThis in substance confirms observations made in the Battery tubes that\r\nsubsidence of the structure followed disturbance of the outside\r\nmaterial, although theoretically the tubes were buoyant in the aqueous\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe writer would urge, however, that, in all cases of submerged\r\nstructures only partially buried in solid material, excess weighting be\r\nused to cover the contingencies of vibration, oscillation, etc., to\r\nwhich such structures may be subjected and which may ultimately allow\r\nleads of water to work their way underneath.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he urges that, in cases of floor areas of deeply\r\nsubmerged structures, such as tunnels or cellars, the pressure to be\r\nresisted should be assumed to be only slightly in excess of that\r\ncorresponding to the pressure due to the water through the voids.\r\n\r\nThe question of pressure, etc., in Class B, or semi-aqueous materials\r\nwill be considered next. Of these materials, as already shown, there are\r\ntwo types: (_a_) sand in which the so-called quicksand is largely in\r\nexcess of any normal voids, and (_b_) plastic and viscous materials. The\r\nwriter believes that these materials should be treated as mixtures of\r\nsolid and watery particles, in the first of which the quicksand, or\r\naqueous portion, being virtually in suspension, may be treated as water,\r\nand it must be concluded that the action here will be similar to that of\r\nsand and pure water, giving a larger value to the properties of water\r\nthan actually exists. If, for instance, it should be found that such a\r\nmixture contained 40% of pure water, the writer would estimate its\r\npressure on or against a structure as (_a_) that of a moist sand\r\nstanding at a steep angle of repose, and (_b_) that of clear water, an\r\nallowance of 60% of the total volume being assumed, and the sum of these\r\ntwo results giving the total pressure. Until more definite data can be\r\nobtained by experiments on a larger scale, this assumed value of 60% of\r\nthe total volume for the aqueous portion may be taken for all conditions\r\nof semi-aqueous materials, except, of course, where the solid and\r\naqueous particles may be clearly defined, the pressures being computed\r\nas described in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of pure quicksand (if such there be) and other\r\naqueous materials of Class C, such as water, oil, mercury, etc., it has\r\nalready been shown that they are to be considered as liquids of their\r\nnormal specific gravity; that is, in calculating the air pressure\r\nnecessary to displace them, one should consider their specific gravity\r\nonly, as a factor, and not the total weight per volume including any\r\nimpurities which they might contain undissolved.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a clearer conception of aqueous and semi-aqueous\r\nmaterials and their action, they must be viewed under conditions not\r\nordinarily apparent. For instance, ideas of so-called quicksand are\r\nlargely drawn from seeing structures sinking into it, or from observing\r\nit flowing through voids in the sheeting or casing. The action of sand\r\nand water under pressure is viewed during or after a slump, when the\r\ndamage is being done, or has been done, whereas the correct view-point\r\nis under static conditions, before the slump takes place.\r\n\r\nThe following is quoted from the report of Mr. C.M. Jacobs, Chief\r\nEngineer of the East River Gas Tunnel, built in 1892-93:\r\n\r\n     \"We found that the material which had heretofore been firm or stiff\r\n     had, under erosion, obtained a soup-like consistency, and that a\r\n     huge cavity some 3 ft. wide and 26 ft. deep had been washed up\r\n     toward the river bed.\"\r\n\r\nThis would probably be a fair description of much of the material of\r\nthis class met with in such work, if compressed air had not been used.\r\nThe writer believes that in soft material surrounding submerged\r\nstructures the water actually contained in the voids is not\r\ninfrequently, after a prolonged period of rest, cut off absolutely from\r\nits sources of pressure and that contact with these sources of pressure\r\nwill not again be resumed until a leak takes place through the\r\nstructure; and, even when there is a small flow or trickling of water\r\nthrough such material, it confines itself to certain paths or channels,\r\nand is largely excluded from the general mass.\r\n\r\nThe broad principle of the bearing power of soil has been made the\r\nsubject of too many experiments and too much controversy to be\r\nconsidered in a paper which is intended to be a description of\r\nexperiments and observed data and notes therefrom. The writer is of the\r\nopinion, however, that entirely too little attention has been given to\r\nthis bearing power of the soil; that while progress has been made in our\r\nknowledge of all classes of materials for structures, very little has\r\nbeen done which leads to any real knowledge of the material on which the\r\nfoundation rests. For instance, it is inconceivable that 1 or 2 tons may\r\nsometimes be allowed on a square foot of soft clay, while the load on\r\nfirm gravel is limited to from 4 to 6 tons. The writer's practical\r\nobservations have convinced him that it is frequently much safer to put\r\nfour times 6 tons on a square foot of gravel than it is to put\r\none-fourth of 2 tons on a square foot of soft clay.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the bearing power of soil, the writer also believes\r\nthat too little study has been given to the questions of the lateral\r\npressure of earth, and he desires to quote here from some experiments\r\ndescribed in a book[F] published in England in 1876, to which his\r\nattention has recently been called. This book appears to have been\r\nintended for young people, but it is of interest to note the following\r\nquotations from a chapter entitled \"Sand.\" This chapter begins by\r\nstating that:\r\n\r\n     \"During the course of a lecture on the Suez Canal by Mr. John H.\r\n     Pepper, which was delivered nightly by him at the Polytechnic\r\n     Institute in London, he illustrated his lecture by some experiments\r\n     designed to exhibit certain properties of sand, which had reference\r\n     to the construction of the Suez Canal, and it is stated that though\r\n     the properties in question were by no means to be classed among\r\n     recent discoveries, the experiments were novel in form and served\r\n     to interest the public audience.\"\r\n\r\nFurther quotation follows:\r\n\r\n     \"When the Suez Canal was projected, many prophesied evil to the\r\n     undertaking, from the sand in the desert being drifted by the wind\r\n     into the canal, and others were apprehensive that where the canal\r\n     was cut through the sand the bottom would be pushed up by the\r\n     pressure on the banks * * *.\r\n\r\n     \"The principle of lateral pressure may now be strikingly\r\n     illustrated by taking an American wooden pail and, having\r\n     previously cut a large circular hole in the bottom, this is now\r\n     covered with fine tissue paper, which should be carefully pasted on\r\n     to prevent the particles of sand from flowing through the small\r\n     openings between the paper and the wood * * * and being placed\r\n     upright and rapidly filled with sand, it may be carried about by\r\n     the handle without the slightest fear of the weight of the sand\r\n     breaking through the thin medium. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"Probably one of the most convincing experiments is that which may\r\n     be performed with a cylindrical tube 18 in. long and 2 in. in\r\n     diameter, open at both ends. A piece of tissue paper is carefully\r\n     pasted on one end, so that when dry no cracks or interstices are\r\n     left. The tube is filled with dry sand to a height of say 12 in. In\r\n     the upper part is inserted a solid plug of wood 12 in. long and of\r\n     the same or very nearly the same diameter as the inside of the\r\n     tube, so that it will move freely up and down like the piston of an\r\n     air pump. The tube, sand, and piston being arranged as described,\r\n     may now be held by an assistant and the demonstrator, taking a\r\n     sledge hammer, may proceed to strike steadily on the end of the\r\n     piston and, although the paper will bulge out a little, the force\r\n     of the blow will not break it.\r\n\r\n     \"If the assistant holding the tube allows it to jerk or rebound\r\n     after each blow of the hammer, the paper may break, because air and\r\n     sand are driven down by the succeeding blow, and therefore it must\r\n     be held steadily so that the piston bears fairly on the sand each\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     \"A still more conclusive and striking experiment may be shown with\r\n     a framework of metal constructed to represent a pail, the sides of\r\n     which are closed up by pasting sheets of tissue paper inside and\r\n     over the lower part. As before demonstrated, when a quantity of\r\n     sand is poured into the pail the tissue paper casing at the bottom\r\n     does not break, but if a sufficient quantity is used the sides\r\n     formed of tissue paper bulge out and usually give way in\r\n     consequence of the lateral pressure exerted by the particles of\r\n     sand.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer has made the second experiment noted, with special apparatus,\r\nand finds that with tissue paper over the bottom of a 2-in. pipe, 15 in.\r\nlong, about 12 in. of sand will stand the blow of a heavy sledge hammer,\r\ntransmitted through a wooden piston, at least once and sometimes two or\r\nthree times, while heavy blows given with a lighter hammer have no\r\neffect at all. That this is not due in any large measure to inertia can\r\nbe shown by the fact that more than 200 lb. can safely be put on top of\r\nthe wooden piston. It cannot be accounted for entirely by the friction,\r\nas the removal of the paper allows the sand to drop in a mass. The\r\nexplanation is that the pressure is transmitted laterally to the sides,\r\nand as the friction is directly proportional to the pressure, the load\r\nor effect of the blow is carried by the proportional increase in the\r\nfriction, and any diaphragm which will carry the direct bottom load will\r\nnot have its stresses largely increased by any greater loading on top.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that experiments will show that in a sand-jack the\r\ntendency will be for the sides to burst rather than the bottom, and that\r\nthe outflow from an orifice at or near the bottom is not either greatly\r\nretarded or accelerated by ordinary pressure on top. The occurrence of\r\nabnormal voids, however, causes the sand to be displaced into them.\r\n\r\nThe important consideration of this paper is that all the experiments\r\nand observations noted point conclusively to the fact that pressure is\r\ntransmitted laterally through ground, most probably along or nearly\r\nparallel to the angles of repose, or in cases of rock or stiff material,\r\nalong a line which, until more conclusive experiments are made, may be\r\ntaken as a mean between the horizontal and vertical, or approximately 45\r\ndegrees. There is no reason to believe that this is not the case\r\nthroughout the entire mass of the earth, that each cubic foot, or yard,\r\nor mile is supported or in turn supports its neighboring equivalent\r\nalong such lines. The theory is not a new one, and its field is too\r\nlarge to encompass within the limits of a single paper, but, for\r\npractical purposes, and within the limited areas to which we must\r\nnecessarily be confined, the writer believes it can be established\r\nbeyond controversy as true. Certain it is that no one has yet found, in\r\nground free from water pressure or abnormal conditions, any evidence of\r\ngreater pressure at the bottom of a deep shaft or tunnel than that near\r\nthe surface. Pressures due to the widening of mines beyond the limits of\r\nsafety must not be taken as a controversion of this statement, as all\r\narches have limits of safety, more especially if the useless material\r\nbelow the theoretical intrados is only partly supported, or is allowed\r\nto be suspended from the natural arch.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes, also, that the question of confined foundations, in\r\ncontradistinction to that of the spreading of foundations, may be worthy\r\nof full discussion, as it applies to safe and economical construction,\r\nand he offers, without special comment, the following observations:\r\n\r\nHe has found that, in soft ground, results are often obtained with small\r\nopen caissons sunk to a depth of a few feet and cleaned out and filled\r\nwith concrete, which offer much better resistance than spreading the\r\nfoundation over four or five times the equivalent area.\r\n\r\nHe has found that small steel piles and coffer-dams, from 1-ft.\r\ncylinders to coffer-dams 4 or 5 ft. square, sunk to a depth of only 1 or\r\n2 ft. below adjacent excavations in ordinary sand, have safely resisted\r\nloads four or five times as great as those usually allowed.\r\n\r\nHe believes that short cylinders, cleaned out and filled with concrete,\r\nor coffer-dams of short steel piling with the surface cleaned out to a\r\nreasonable depth and filled with concrete horizontally reinforced, will,\r\nin many instances, give as good results as, and, in most cases, very\r\nmuch better than, placing the foundation on an equivalent number of\r\nsmall long piles or a proportionately greater spread of foundation area,\r\nthe idea being that the transmission of pressure to the sides of the\r\ncoffer-dam will not only confine the side thrust, but will also transfer\r\nthe loading in mass to a greater depth where the resistance to lateral\r\npressure in the ground will be more stable; that is, the greater depth\r\nof foundation is gained without the increased excessive loading, or\r\nnecessity for deep excavation.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of the bearing value and friction on piles, the\r\nwriter believes that while the literature on engineering is full of\r\nexperimental data relating to friction on caissons, there is little to\r\nshow the real value of friction on piles. The assumption generally made\r\nof an assumed bearing value, and the deduction therefrom of a value for\r\nthe skin friction is fallacious. Distinction, also, is not made, but\r\nshould be clearly drawn between skin friction, pure and simple, on\r\nsmooth surfaces, and the friction due to pressure. Too often the bearing\r\nvalue on irregular surfaces as well as the bearing due to taper in\r\npiles, and lastly the resistance offered by binding, enter into the\r\ndetermination of so-called skin friction formulas. The essential\r\ncondition of sinking a caisson is keeping it plumb; and binding, which\r\nis another way of writing increased bearing value, will oftentimes be\r\nfatal to success.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that a series of observations on caissons sunk plumb\r\nunder homogeneous conditions of ground and superficial smoothness will\r\nshow a proportional increase of skin friction per square foot average\r\nfor each increase in the size of caissons, as well as for increase of\r\ndepth in the sinking up to certain points, where it may finally become\r\nconstant, as will be shown later. The determination of the actual\r\nfriction or coefficient of friction between the surfaces of the pile and\r\nthe material it encounters, is not difficult to determine. In sand it is\r\napproximately 40% of the pressure for reasonably smooth iron or steel,\r\nand 45% of the pressure for ordinary wood surfaces. If, for instance, a\r\nlong shaft be withdrawn vertically from moulding sand, the hole may\r\nremain indefinitely as long as water does not get into it or it does not\r\ndry out. This is due to the tendency of the sand to arch itself\r\nhorizontally over small areas. The same operation cannot be performed on\r\ndry sand, as the arching properties, while protecting the pile from\r\nexcessive pressure due to excessive length, will not prevent the loose\r\nsand immediately surrounding the pile from exerting a constant pressure\r\nagainst the pile, and it is of this pressure that 45% may be taken as\r\nthe real value of skin friction on piles in dry sand.\r\n\r\nIn soft clays or peats which are displaced by driving, the tendency of\r\nthis material to flow back into the original space causes pressure, of\r\nwhich the friction will be a measured percentage. In this case, however,\r\nthe friction itself between the material and the clays or peat is\r\nusually very much less than 40%, and it is for this reason that piles of\r\nalmost indefinite length may be driven in materials of this character\r\nwithout offering sufficient resistance to be depended on, as long as no\r\ngood bearing ground is found at the point.\r\n\r\nIf this material is under water, and is so soft as to be considered\r\nsemi-aqueous, the pressure per square foot will increase in diminishing\r\nproportion to the depth, and the pressure per area will soon approach\r\nand become a constant, due to the resistance offered by the lateral\r\narching of the solid material; whereas, in large circular caissons, or\r\ncaisson shafts, where the horizontal arching effect is virtually\r\ndestroyed, or at least rendered non-effective until a great depth is\r\nreached, the pressure must necessarily vary under these conditions\r\nproportionately to the depth and size of the caisson in semi-aqueous\r\nmaterial. On the other hand, in large caisson shafts, especially those\r\nwhich are square, the pressure at the top due to the solid material will\r\nalso increase proportionately to the depth, as already explained in\r\nconnection with the pressures of earth against sheeting and retaining\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that the pressure on these surfaces may be\r\ndetermined with reasonable accuracy by the formulas already given in\r\nthis paper, and with these pressures, multiplied by the coefficient of\r\nfriction determined by the simplest experiment on the ground, results\r\nmay be obtained which will closely approximate the actual friction on\r\ncaissons at given depths. The friction on caissons, which is usually\r\ngiven at from 200 to 600 lb. per sq. ft., is frequently assumed to be\r\nthe same on piles 12 in. or less in diameter, whereas the pressures on\r\nthese surfaces, as shown, are in no way comparable.\r\n\r\nThe following notes and observations are given in connection with the\r\nskin friction and the bearing value of piles:\r\n\r\nThe writer has in his possession a copy of an official print which was\r\nrecently furnished to bidders in connection with the foundation for a\r\nlarge public building in New York City. The experiments were made on\r\ngood sand at a depth of approximately 43 ft. below water and 47 ft.\r\nbelow an adjacent excavation. In this instance a 16-in. pipe was sunk to\r\nthe depth stated, cleaned out, and a 14-in. piston connected to a 10-in.\r\npipe was inserted and the ground at the bottom of the 16-in. pipe\r\nsubjected to a loading approximating 28 tons per sq. ft. After an\r\ninitial settlement of nearly 3 in., there was no further settlement over\r\nan extended period, although the load of 28 tons per sq. ft. was\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nIn connection with some recent underpinning work, 14-in. hollow\r\ncylindrical piles 6 ft. long were sunk to a depth of 6 ft. with an\r\nordinary hand-hammer, being excavated as driven. These piles were then\r\nfilled with concrete and subjected to a loading in some cases\r\napproximating 60 tons. After a settlement ranging from 9 to 13 in., no\r\nfurther settlement took place, although the loading was maintained for a\r\nconsiderable period.\r\n\r\nIn connection with some other pile work, the writer has seen a 10-in.\r\npipe, 3/8 in. thick, 4 ft. below the bottom of an open cylinder, at a\r\ndepth of about 20 ft., sustain in gravel and sand a load approximating\r\n50 tons when cleaned out to within 2 ft. of the bottom.\r\n\r\nHe has seen other cylindrical piles with a bearing ring of not more than\r\n¾ in. resting on gravel at a depth of from 20 to 30 ft., cleaned out\r\npractically to the bottom, sustain a measured load of 60 tons without\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nAs to skin friction in sand, a case came under his observation wherein a\r\n14-in. hollow cylindrical pile which had stood for 28 days at a depth of\r\nabout 30 ft. in the sand, was cleaned out to its bottom and subjected to\r\nhydraulic pressure, measured by a gauge, and sunk 2 ft. into the sand\r\nwithout any pressure being registered on the gauge. It should be\r\nexplained, however, that the gauge could be subjected to a pressure of\r\n250 lb., equal to a total pressure of 7,000 lb. on the piston of the\r\njack without registering, which corresponded, assuming it all as skin\r\nfriction, to a maximum of not more than 78 lb. per sq. ft., but it\r\nshould be noted that this included bearing value as well, and that the\r\npressure was very far from 7,000 lb., in all probability, at the\r\nbeginning of the test.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the California stove-pipe wells driven by the Board of\r\nWater Supply on Long Island, the writer is informed that one of these\r\ntubes, 12 in. in diameter, was sunk to a depth of 850 ft. In doing this\r\nwork the pile was excavated below the footing with a sand pump and was\r\nthen sunk by hydraulic pressure. Assuming the maximum capacity of the\r\njacks at 100 tons, which is not probable, the skin friction could not\r\nhave amounted to more than 75 lb. per sq. ft. It cannot be assumed in\r\nthis case that the excavation of the material below the pile relieved\r\nthe skin itself of some of its friction, as the operation consumed more\r\nthan 6 weeks, and, even if excess material was removed, it is certain\r\nthat a large percentage of it would have had time to adjust itself\r\nbefore the operation was completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX, FIG. 1.--A 14-GAUGE, 14-IN., HOLLOW\r\n(NON-TELESCOPIC), CALIFORNIA STOVE-PIPE PILE WHICH MET IMPENETRABLE\r\nMATERIAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX, FIG. 2.--CHENOWETH PILE, PENETRATING HARD\r\nMATERIAL.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this, the writer may call attention to the fact that\r\npiles driven in silt along the North River, and in soft material at\r\nother places, are sometimes 90 ft. in length, and even then do not offer\r\nsufficient resistance to be depended on for loading. This is due to the\r\nfact that the end of the pile does not bear in good material.\r\n\r\nThe relation between bearing value and skin friction on a pile, where\r\nthe end bearing is in good material, is well shown by a case where a\r\nwooden pile[G] struck solid material, was distorted under the continual\r\nblows of the hammer, and was afterward exposed. It is also shown in the\r\ncase of a 14-in. California stove-pipe pile, No. 14 gauge, the point of\r\nwhich met firm material. The result, as shown by Fig. 1, Plate XXIX,\r\nspeaks for itself. Fig. 2, Plate XXIX, shows a Chenoweth pile which was\r\nan experimental one driven by its designer. This pile, after getting\r\ninto hard material, was subjected to the blow of a 4,000-lb. hammer\r\nfalling the full length of the pile-driver, and the only result was to\r\nshatter the head of the pile, and not cause further penetration. Mr.\r\nChenoweth has stated to the writer that he has found material so compact\r\nthat it could not be penetrated with a solid pile--either with or\r\nwithout jetting--which is in line with the writer's experience.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that the foregoing notes will show conclusively that\r\nthe factor to be sought in pile work is bearing value rather than depth\r\nor skin friction, and, however valuable skin friction may be in the\r\nlarger caissons, it cannot be depended on in the case of small piles,\r\nexcept in values ranging from 25 to 100 lb. per sq. ft.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he desires to thank the following gentlemen, who have\r\ncontributed to the success of the experiments noted herein: Mr. James W.\r\nNelson, of Richard Dudgeon, New York; Mr. George Noble, of John Simmons\r\nand Company, New York; and Mr. Pendleton, of Hindley and Pendleton,\r\nBrooklyn, N.Y.; all of whom have furnished apparatus for the experiments\r\nand have taken an interest in the results. And lastly, he desires\r\nespecially to thank Mr. F.L. Cranford, of the Cranford Company, for men\r\nand material with which to make the experiments and without whose\r\nco-operation it would have been impracticable for the writer to have\r\nmade them.\r\n\r\nThroughout this paper the writer has endeavored, as far as possible, to\r\ndeduce from his observations and from the observations of others, as far\r\nas he has been able to obtain them, practical data and formulas which\r\nmay be of use in establishing the relationship between the pressure,\r\nresistance, and stability of earths; and, while he does not wish to\r\ndictate the character of the discussion, he does ask that those who have\r\nmade observations of a similar character or who have available data,\r\nwill, as far as possible, contribute the same to this discussion. It is\r\nonly by such observations and experiments, and deductions therefrom,\r\nthat engineers may obtain a better knowledge of the handling of such\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that too much has been taken for granted in\r\nconnection with earth pressures and resistance; and that, far too often,\r\nobservations of the results of natural laws have been set down as\r\nphenomena. He believes that, both in experimenting and observing, the\r\nengineer will frequently find what is being looked for or expected and\r\nwill fail to see the obvious alternative. He may add that his own\r\nexperiments and observations may be criticized for the same reason, and\r\nhe asks, therefore, that all possible light be thrown on this subject. A\r\ncomparative study of much of our expert testimony or of the plans of\r\nalmost any of the structures designed in connection with their bearing\r\nupon earth, or resistance to earth pressure, will show that under the\r\npresent methods of interpretation of the underlying principles governing\r\nthe calculations and designs relating to such structures, the results\r\nvary far too widely. Too much is left to the judgment of the engineer,\r\nand too frequently no fixed standards can be found for some of the most\r\nessential conditions.\r\n\r\nUntil the engineer can say with certainty that his calculations are\r\nreasonably based on facts, he is forced to admit that his design must be\r\nlacking, either in the elements of safety, on the one hand, or of\r\neconomy, on the other, and, until he can give to his client a full\r\nmeasure of both these factors in fair proportion, he cannot justly claim\r\nthat his profession has reached its full development.\r\n\r\nTable 1 gives

KENNARD THOMSON, M. AM. SOC. C. E.--Although the author\r\ndeserves great credit for the careful and thorough manner in which he\r\nhas handled this subject, his paper should be labeled \"Dangerous for\r\nBeginners,\" especially as he is an engineer of great practical\r\nexperience; if he were not, comparatively little attention would be paid\r\nto his statements. The paper is dangerous because many will read only\r\nportions of it, or will not read it thoroughly. For instance, at the\r\nbeginning, the author cites several experiments in which considerable\r\nforce is required to start the lifting of a weight or plunger in sand\r\nand water and much less after the start. This reminds the speaker of the\r\ntime when, as a schoolboy, he tried to pick up stones from the bottom of\r\nthe river and was told that the \"suction\" was caused by atmospheric\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe inference is that tunnels, etc., in sand, etc., are not in any\r\ndanger of rising, even though they are lighter than water. Toward the\r\nend of the paper, however, the author states that tunnels should be\r\nweighted, but he rather spoils this by stating that they should be\r\nweighted only enough to overcome the actual water pressure, that is,\r\nbetween the voids of the sand. It seems to the speaker that the only\r\nreally safe way is to make the tunnel at least as heavy as the water\r\ndisplaced in order to prevent it from coming up, and to take other\r\nmeasures to prevent it from going down. The City of Toronto, Canada,\r\nformerly pumped its water supply through a 6-ft. iron pipe, buried in\r\nthe sand under Toronto Bay and then under Toronto Island, with an intake\r\nin the deep water of the lake. During a storm a mass of seaweed, etc.,\r\nwas washed against the intake, completely blocking it, and although the\r\nman at the pumping station knew that something was wrong, he continued\r\nto pump until the water was drawn out of the pipe, with the result that\r\nabout half a mile of the conduit started to rise and then broke at\r\nseveral places, thus allowing it to fill with water. Eventually, the\r\ncity went down to bed-rock under the Bay for its water tunnel.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for calling this paper dangerous for beginners is that it\r\nis improbable that experienced engineers or contractors will omit the\r\nbracing at the bottom, although, since the paper was printed, a glaring\r\ninstance has occurred where comparatively little bracing was put in the\r\nbottom of a 40-ft. cut, the result being a bad cave-in from the bottom,\r\nalthough all the top braces remained in place. Most engineers will agree\r\nthat nearly every crib which has failed slipped out from the bottom, and\r\ndid not turn over.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the angle of repose is that it is not possible to\r\nascertain it for any material deposited by Nature. It could probably be\r\nascertained for a sand bank deposited by Man, but not for an excavation\r\nto be made in the ground, for it is known that nearly all earth, etc.,\r\nhas been deposited under great pressure, and is likely to be cemented\r\ntogether by clay, loam, roots, trees, boulders, etc., and differs in\r\ncharacter every few feet.\r\n\r\nA deep vertical cut can often be made, even in New York quicksand, from\r\nwhich the water has been drawn, and, if not subjected to jars, water,\r\netc., this material will stand for considerable time and then come down\r\nlike an avalanche, killing any one in its way. In such cases very little\r\nbracing would prevent the slide from starting, provided rain, etc., did\r\nnot loosen the material.\r\n\r\nThe author, of course, treats dry and wet materials differently, but\r\nthere are very few places where dry material is not likely to become wet\r\nbefore the excavation is completed.\r\n\r\nIn caisson work, if the caisson can be kept absolutely plumb, it can be\r\nsunk without having to overcome much friction, while, on the other hand,\r\nif it is not kept plumb, the material is more or less disturbed and\r\nbegins to bind, causing considerable friction. The author claims that\r\nthe pressure does not increase with the depth, but all caisson men will\r\nprobably remember that the friction to be overcome per square foot of\r\nsurface increases with the depth.\r\n\r\nIn calculating retaining walls, many engineers add the weight of the\r\nsoil to the water, and calculate for from 90 to 100 lb. per cu. ft. The\r\nspeaker is satisfied that in the so-called New York quicksand it is\r\nsufficient to use the weight of the water only. If the sand increased\r\nthe side pressure above the water pressure, engineers would expect to\r\nuse more compressed air to hold it back, while, as a matter of fact, the\r\nair pressure used seldom varies much from that called for by the\r\nhydrostatic head.\r\n\r\nAlthough allowance for water pressure is sufficient for designing\r\nretaining walls in New York quicksand, it is far from sufficient in\r\ncertain silty materials. For instance, in Maryland, a coffer-dam,\r\nexcavated to a depth of 30 ft. in silt and water, had the bottom shoved\r\nin 2 ft., in spite of the fact that the waling pieces were 5 ft. apart\r\nvertically at the top and 3 ft. at the bottom, and were braced with 12\r\nby 12-in. timbers, every 7 ft. horizontally. The walings split, and the\r\ncross-braces cut into the waling pieces from 1 to 2 in.; in other words,\r\nthe pressure seemed to be almost irresistible. This is quite a contrast\r\nto certain excavations in Brooklyn, which, without any bracing whatever,\r\nwere safely carried down 15 ft.\r\n\r\nAny engineer who tries to guess at the angle of repose, and, from the\r\nresulting calculations, economizes on his bottom struts, will find that\r\nsooner or later an accident on one job will cause enough loss of life\r\nand money to pay for conservative timbers for the rest of his life. So\r\nmuch for side pressures. As to the pressure in the roof of a tunnel,\r\nprobably every engineer will agree that almost any material except\r\nunfrozen water will tend to arch more or less, but how much it is\r\nimpossible to say. It is doubtful whether any experienced engineer would\r\never try to carry all the weight over the roof, except in the case of\r\nback-fill, and even then he would have to make his own assumption (which\r\nsounds more polite than \"guess\").\r\n\r\nThe author has stated, however, that when the tunnel roof and sides are\r\nin place, no further trouble need be feared. On the contrary, in 1885,\r\nthe Canadian Pacific Railroad built a tunnel through clayey material and\r\nlined it with ordinary 12 by 12-in. timber framing, about 2 or 3 ft.\r\napart. After the tunnel was completed, it collapsed. It was re-excavated\r\nand lined with 12 by 12-in. timbers side by side, and it collapsed\r\nagain; then the tunnel was abandoned, and, for some 20 years, the track,\r\ncarried around on a 23° curve, was used until a new tunnel was built\r\nfarther in. This trouble could have been caused either by the sliding or\r\nswelling of the material, and the speaker is inclined to believe that it\r\nwas caused by swelling, for it is known, of course, that most material\r\nhas been deposited by Nature under great pressure, and, by excavating in\r\ncertain materials, the air and moisture would cause those materials to\r\nswell and become an irresistible force.\r\n\r\nTo carry the load, Mr. Meem prefers to rely on the points of the piles\r\nrather than the side friction. In such cases the pile would act as a\r\npost, and would probably fail when ordinarily loaded, unless firmly\r\nsupported at the sides. The speaker has seen piles driven from 80 to 90\r\nft. in 10 min., which offered almost no resistance, and yet, a few days\r\nlater, they would sustain 40 tons each. No one would dream of putting 40\r\ntons on a 90-ft. pile resting on rock, if it were not adequately\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nIt is the speaker's opinion that bracing should not be omitted for\r\neither piles or coffer-dams.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES E. GREGORY, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C. E.--In describing his\r\nlast experiment with the hydraulic chambers and plunger, Mr. Meem states\r\nthat, after letting the pressure stand at 25 lb., etc., the piston came\r\nup. This suggests that the piston might have been raised at a much lower\r\npressure, if it had been allowed to stand long enough.\r\n\r\nThe depth and coarseness of the sand were not varied to ascertain\r\nwhether any relation exists between them and the pressure required to\r\nlift the piston. If the pressure varied with the depth of sand, it would\r\nindicate that the reduction was due to the resistance of the water when\r\nfinely divided by the sand; if it varied with the coarseness of the\r\nsand, as it undoubtedly would, especially if the sand grains were\r\nincreased to spheres 1 in. in diameter, it would show that it was\r\nindependent of the voids in the sand, but dependent on dividing the\r\nwater into thin films.\r\n\r\nThe speaker believes that the greater part of the reduction of pressure\r\non the bottom of the piston might be better explained by the viscosity\r\nof the water, than to assume that a considerable part of the plunger is\r\nnot in contact with it. The water, being divided by fine sand into very\r\nthin films, has a tensile strength which is capable of resisting the\r\npressure for at least a limited time.\r\n\r\nIf the water is capable of exerting its full hydrostatic pressure\r\nthrough the sand, the total pressure would be the full hydrostatic\r\npressure on the bottom of the piston where in contact, and, where\r\nseparated from it by a grain of sand, the pressure would be decreased\r\nonly by the weight of the grain. If a large proportion of the top area\r\nof a grain is in contact, as assumed by the author, this reduction of\r\npressure would be very small. A correct interpretation can be obtained\r\nonly after more complete experiments have been made.\r\n\r\nFor horizontal pressures exerted by saturated sands on vertical walls,\r\nit has not been demonstrated that anything should be deducted from full\r\nwater pressure. No matter how much of the area is in direct contact with\r\nthe sand rather than the water, the full water pressure would be\r\ntransmitted through each sand grain from its other side and, if\r\nnecessary, from and through many other grains which may be in turn in\r\ncontact with it. The pressure on such a wall will be water pressure over\r\nits entire surface, and, in addition, the thrust of the sand after\r\ncorrecting for its loss of weight in the water.\r\n\r\nThe fact that small cavities may be excavated from the sides of trenches\r\nor tunnels back of the sheeting proves only that there is a local\r\ntemporary arching of the material, or that the cohesion of the particles\r\nis sufficient to withstand the stress temporarily, or that there is a\r\ncombination of cohesion and arching. The possibility of making such\r\nexcavations does not prove that pressure does not exist at such points.\r\nThat sand or earth will arch under certain conditions has long been an\r\naccepted fact. The sand arches experimented with developed their\r\nstrength only after considerable yielding and, therefore, give no index\r\nof the distribution or intensity of stress before such yielding.\r\nFurthermore, sand and earth in Nature are not constrained by forms and\r\nreinforcing rods.\r\n\r\nMr. Meem's paper is very valuable in that it presents some unusual\r\nphenomena, but many of the conclusions drawn therefrom cannot be\r\naccepted without further demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS W. PERRY, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C. E.--Pressure-gauge\r\nobservations on a number of pneumatic caissons recently sunk, through\r\nvarious grades of sand, to rock at depths of from 85 to 105 ft. below\r\nground-water, invariably showed working-chamber air-pressures equal, as\r\nclosely as could be observed, to the hydrostatic pressures computed, for\r\ncorresponding depths of cutting-edge, as given in Table 2.\r\n\r\nThese observations and computations were made by the speaker in\r\nconnection with the caisson foundations for the Municipal Building, New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.--EQUIVALENT FEET OF DEPTH BELOW WATER PER POUND\r\nPRESSURE.\r\n\r\nPressure, |Equivalent |Equivalent   |Observed      |\r\nin        |feet of    |elevation    |pressure.     |\r\npounds.   |depth.     |for water    |              |\r\n          |           |at--6.85.    |              |\r\n          |___________|_____________|              |\r\n          |           |             |              |\r\n          |M.H.W.     |Ground-water.|              |\r\n__________|___________|_____________|______________|\r\n          |           |             |              |\r\n  1       |  2.31     |  9.06       |Practically   |\r\n  2       |  4.63     | 11.48       |the same as   |\r\n  3       |  6.94     | 13.79       |computed      |\r\n  4       |  9.25     | 16.10       |for           |\r\n  5       | 11.57     | 18.42       |ground-water. |\r\n  6       | 13.88     | 20.73       |              |\r\n  7       | 16.19     | 23.04       |              |\r\n  8       | 18.50     | 25.35       |              |\r\n  9       | 20.82     | 27.67       |              |\r\n 10       | 23.13     | 29.98       |              |\r\n 11       | 25.44     | 32.29       |              |\r\n 12       | 27.76     | 34.61       |              |\r\n 13       | 30.07     | 36.92       |              |\r\n 14       | 32.38     | 39.23       |              |\r\n 15       | 34.70     | 41.55       |              |\r\n 16       | 37.01     | 43.86       |              |\r\n 17       | 39.32     | 46.17       |              |\r\n 18       | 41.63     | 48.48       |              |\r\n 19       | 43.95     | 50.80       |              |\r\n 20       | 46.26     | 53.11       |              |\r\n 21       | 48.57     | 55.42       |              |\r\n 22       | 50.89     | 57.74       |              |\r\n 23       | 53.20     | 60.05       |              |\r\n 24       | 55.51     | 62.36       |              |\r\n 25       | 57.82     | 64.67       |              |\r\n 26       | 60.14     | 66.99       |              |\r\n 27       | 62.45     | 69.30       |              |\r\n 28       | 64.76     | 71.61       |              |\r\n 29       | 67.08     | 73.93       |              |\r\n 30       | 69.39     | 76.24       |              |\r\n 31       | 71.70     | 78.55       |              |\r\n 32       | 74.01     | 80.86       |              |\r\n 33       | 76.33     | 83.18       |              |\r\n 34       | 78.64     | 85.49       |              |\r\n 35       | 80.95     | 87.80       |              |\r\n 36       | 83.27     | 90.12       |              |\r\n 37       | 85.58     | 92.43       |              |\r\n 38       | 87.89     | 94.74       |              |\r\n 39       | 90.20     | 97.05       |              |\r\n 40       | 92.52     | 99.37       |              |\r\n 41       | 94.83     |101.68       |              |\r\n 42       | 97.14     |103.99       |              |\r\n 43       | 99.46     |106.31       |              |\r\n 44       |101.77     |108.62       |              |\r\n 45       |104.08     |110.93       |              |\r\n 46       |106.39     |113.24       |              |\r\n__________|___________|_____________|______________|\r\n\r\n                                    34\r\nNOTE.--Equivalent depth in feet = ------ × pressure.\r\n                                   14.7\r\n\r\n\r\nE.P. GOODRICH, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--This paper is to\r\nbe characterized by superlatives. Parts of it are believed to be\r\nexceptionally good, while other parts are considered equally dangerous.\r\nThe author's experimental work is extremely interesting, and the writer\r\nbelieves the results obtained to be of great value; but the analytical\r\nwork, both mathematical and logical, is emphatically questioned.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that, in the design of permanent structures,\r\nconsideration of arch action should not be included, at least, not until\r\nmuch more information has been obtained. He also believes that the\r\ndesign of temporary structures with this inclusion is actually dangerous\r\nin some instances, and takes the liberty of citing the following\r\nstatement by the author, with regard to his first experiment:\r\n\r\n     \"About an hour after the superimposed load had been removed, the\r\n     writer jostled the box with his foot sufficiently to dislodge some\r\n     of the exposed sand, when the arch at once collapsed and the bottom\r\n     fell to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer emphatically questions the author's ideas as to \"the\r\nthickness of key\" which \"should be allowed\" over tunnels, believing that\r\nconditions within an earth mass, except in very rare instances, are\r\nsuch that true arch action will seldom take place to any definite\r\nextent, through any considerable depths. Furthermore, the author's\r\nreason for bisecting the angle between the vertical and the angle of\r\nrepose of the material, when he undertakes to determine the thickness of\r\nkey, is not obvious. This assumption is shown to be absurd when carried\r\nto either limit, for when the angle of repose equals zero, as is the\r\ncase with water, this, method would give a definite thickness of key,\r\nwhile there can be absolutely no arch action possible in such a case;\r\nand, when the angle of repose is 90°, as may be assumed in the case of\r\nrock, this method would give an infinite thickness of key, which is\r\nagain seen to be absurd. It would seem as if altogether too many\r\nunknowable conditions had been assumed. In any case, no arch action can\r\nbe brought into play until a certain amount of settlement has taken\r\nplace so as to bring the particles into closer contact, and in such a\r\nway that the internal stresses are practically those only of\r\ncompression, and the shearing stresses are within the limits possible\r\nfor the material in question.\r\n\r\nThe author has repeatedly made assumptions which are not borne out by\r\nthe application of his mathematical formulas to actual extreme\r\nconditions. This method of application to limiting conditions is\r\nconcededly sometimes faulty; but the writer believes that no earth\r\npressure theory, or one concerning arch action, can be considered as\r\nsatisfactory which does not apply equally well to hydraulic pressure\r\nproblems when the proper assumptions are made as to the factors for\r\nfriction, cohesion, etc. For example, when the angle of repose is\r\nconsidered as zero, in the author's first formula for _W_{1}_, the value\r\nbecomes ½ _W_{1}_, whereas it should depend solely on the depth, which\r\ndoes not enter the formula, and not at all on the width of opening, _l_,\r\nwhich is thus included.\r\n\r\nThe author has given no experiments to prove his statement that \"the\r\narch thrust is greater in dryer sand,\" and the accuracy of the statement\r\nis questioned. Again, no reason is apparent for assuming the direction\r\nof the \"rakers\" in Fig. 3 as that of the angle of repose. The writer\r\ncannot see why that particular angle is repeatedly used, when almost any\r\nother would give results of a similar kind. The author has made no\r\nexperiments which show any connection between the angle of repose, as he\r\ninterprets it, and the lines of arch action which he assumes to exist.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the illustration of the condition which is thought to\r\nexist when the \"material is composed of large bowling balls,\" supposedly\r\nall of the same size, the writer believes the conclusion to be\r\nerroneous, and that this can be readily seen by inspection of a diagram\r\nin which such balls are represented as forming a pile similar to the\r\nwell-known \"pile of shells\" of the algebras, in the diagram of which a\r\npile of three shells, resting on the base, has been omitted. It is then\r\nseen that unless the pressures at an angle of 60° with the horizontal\r\nare sufficient to produce frictional resistance of a very large amount,\r\nthe balls will roll and instantly break the arch action suggested by the\r\nauthor. Consequently, an almost infinitesimal settlement of the\r\n\"centering\" may cause the complete destruction of an arch of earth.\r\n\r\nThe author's logic is believed to be entirely faulty in many cases\r\nbecause he repeatedly makes assumptions which are not in accordance with\r\ndemonstrated fact, and finally sums up the results by the statement: \"It\r\nis conceded\" (line 2, p. 357, for example), when the writer, for one,\r\nhas not even conceded the accuracy of the assumptions. For instance, the\r\nauthor's well-known theory that pressures against retaining walls are a\r\nmaximum at the top and decrease to zero at the bottom, is in absolute\r\ncontradiction to the results of experiments conducted on a large scale\r\nby the writer on the new reinforced concrete retaining wall near the St.\r\nGeorge Ferry, on Staten Island, New York City, which will soon be\r\npublished, and in which the usual law of increase of lateral pressure\r\nwith depth is believed to be demonstrated beyond question. It must be\r\nconceded that a considerable arch action (so-called) actually exists in\r\nmany cases; but it should be equally conceded by the advocates of the\r\nexistence of such action that changes in humidity, due to moving water,\r\nvibration, and appreciable viscosity, etc., will invariably destroy this\r\naction in time. In consequence, the author's reasoning in regard to the\r\npressures against the faces of retaining walls is believed to be open to\r\ngrave question as to accuracy of assumption, method, and conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe author is correct in so far as he assumes that \"the character of the\r\nstresses due to the thrust of the material will\" not \"change if bracing\r\nshould be substituted for the material in the area\" designated by him,\r\netc., provided he makes the further assumption that absolutely no\r\nmotion, however infinitesimal, has taken place meantime; but, unless\r\nsuch motion has actually taken place, no arch action can have developed.\r\nAn arch thrust can result only with true arch action, that is, with\r\nstable abutments, and the mass stressed wholly in compression, with\r\ncorresponding shortening of the arch line. The arch thrust must be\r\nproportional to the elastic deformation (shortening) of the arch line.\r\nIf any such arch as is shown in Fig. 5 is assumed to carry the whole of\r\nthe weight of material above it, that assumed arch must relieve all the\r\nassumed arches below. Therefore each of the assumed arches can carry\r\nnothing more than its own mass. Otherwise the resulting thrust would\r\nincrease with the depth, which is opposed to the author's theory.\r\n\r\nTurning again to the condition that each arch can carry only its own\r\nweight: if these arches are assumed of thicknesses proportional to the\r\ndistance upward from the bottom of the wall, they will be similar\r\nfigures, and it is easily demonstrated that the thrust will then be\r\nuniform in amount throughout the whole height of the wall, except,\r\nperhaps, at the very top. This condition is contrary to the author's\r\nideas and also to the facts as demonstrated by the writer's experiment\r\non the 40-ft. retaining wall at St. George. Consequently, the author's\r\nstatement: \"nor can anyone * * * doubt that the top timbers are stressed\r\nmore heavily than those at the bottom,\" is emphatically doubted and\r\nearnestly denied by the writer. Furthermore, \"the assumption\" made by\r\nthe author as to \"the tendency of the material to slide\" so as to cause\r\nit \"to wedge * * * between the face of the sheeting * * * and some plane\r\nbetween the sheeting and the plane of repose,\" is considered as\r\nabsolutely unwarranted, and consequently the whole conclusion is\r\nbelieved to be unjustified. Nor is the author's assumption (line 5, p.\r\n361), that \"the thrust * * * is measured by its weight divided by the\r\ntangent of the * * * angle of repose\" at all obvious.\r\n\r\nThe author presents some very interesting photographs showing the\r\nnatural surface slopes of various materials; but it is interesting to\r\nnote that he describes these slopes as having been produced by the\r\n\"continual slipping down of particles.\" The vast difference between\r\nangles of repose produced in this manner by the rolling friction of\r\nparticles and the internal angles of friction, which must be used in all\r\nearth-pressure investigations, has been repeatedly called to the\r\nattention of engineers by the writer.[H]\r\n\r\nThe writer's experiments are entirely in accord with those of the author\r\nin which the latter claims to demonstrate that \"earth and water\r\npressures act independently of each other,\" and the writer is much\r\ndelighted that his own experiments have been thus confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn Experiment No. 3, the query is naturally suggested: \"What would have\r\nbeen the result if the nuts and washers had first been tightened and\r\nwater then added?\" Although the writer has not tried the experiment, he\r\nis rather inclined to the idea that the arch would have collapsed. With\r\nregard to Experiment No. 5, there is to be noted an interesting\r\npossibility of its application to the theoretical discussion of masonry\r\ndams, in which films of water are assumed to exist beneath the structure\r\nor in crevices or cracks of capillary dimensions. The writer has always\r\nconsidered the assumptions made by many designing engineers as\r\nunnecessarily conservative. In regard to the author's conclusions from\r\nExperiment No. 6, it should be noted that no friction can exist between\r\nparticles of sand and surrounding water unless there is a tendency of\r\nthe latter to move; and that water in motion does not exert pressures\r\nequal to those produced when in a static condition, the reduction being\r\nproportional to the velocity of flow.\r\n\r\nThe author's conclusion (p. 371), that \"pressure will cause the\r\nquicksand to set up hydraulic action,\" does not seem to have been\r\ndemonstrated by his experiments, but to be only his theory. In this\r\ninstance, the results of the writer's experiments are contrary to the\r\nauthor's theory and conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe writer will heartily add his protest to that of the author \"against\r\nconsidering semi-aqueous masses, such as soupy sands, soft concrete,\r\netc., as exerting hydrostatic pressure due to their weight in bulk,\r\ninstead of to the specific gravity of the basic liquid.\" Again,\r\nsimilarly hearty concurrence is given to the author's statement:\r\n\r\n     \"If the solid material in any liquid is agitated, so that it is\r\n     virtually in suspension, it cannot add to the pressure, and if\r\n     allowed to subside it acts as a solid, independently of the water\r\n     contained with it, although the water may change somewhat the\r\n     properties of the material, by increasing or changing its cohesion,\r\n     angle of repose, etc.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is believed that the author's statement, as to\r\n\"the tendency of marbles to arch,\" a few lines above the one last\r\nquoted, should be qualified by the addition of the words, \"only when a\r\ncertain amount of deflection has taken place so as to bring the arch\r\ninto action.\" Again, on the following page, a somewhat similar\r\nqualification should be added to the sentence referring to the soft clay\r\narch, that it would \"stand if the rods supporting the intrados of the\r\narch were keyed back to washers covering a sufficiently large area,\" by\r\ninserting the words, \"unless creeping pressures (such as those\r\nencountered by the writer in his experiments) were exceeded.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer considers as very doubtful the formula for _D_{x}_, which is\r\nthe same as that for _W_{1}_, already discussed. The author's statement\r\nthat \"additional back-fill will [under certain circumstances] lighten\r\nthe load on the structure,\" is considered subject to modification by\r\nsome such clause as the following, \"the word 'lighten' here being\r\nunderstood to mean the reduction to some extent of what would be the\r\ntotal pressure due to the combined original and added back-fill,\r\nprovided no arch action occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer is in entire agreement with the author as to the probability\r\nthat water is often \"cut off absolutely from its source of pressure,\"\r\nwith the attendant results described by the author (p. 378); and again,\r\nthat too little attention has been given to the bearing power of soil,\r\nwith the author's accompanying criticism.\r\n\r\nThe writer cannot see, however, where the author's experiments\r\ndemonstrate his statement \"that pressure is transmitted laterally\r\nthrough ground, most probably along or nearly parallel to the angles of\r\nrepose,\" or any of the conclusions drawn by him in the paragraph (p.\r\n381), which contains this questionable statement. Again the writer is at\r\na loss as to how to interpret the statement that the author has found\r\nthat \"better resistance\" has been offered by \"small open caissons sunk\r\nto a depth of a few feet and cleaned out and filled with concrete\" than\r\nby \"spreading the foundation over four or five times the equivalent\r\narea.\" The writer agrees with the author in the majority of his\r\nstatements as to the \"bearing value and friction on piles,\" but believes\r\nthat he is indulging in pure theory in some of his succeeding remarks,\r\nwherein he ascribes to arch action the results which he believes would\r\nbe observed if \"a long shaft be withdrawn vertically from moulding\r\nsand.\" These phenomena would be due rather to capillary action and the\r\nresulting cohesion.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the writer doubts the author's conclusions as to the pressure\r\nat the top of large square caisson shafts when he states that \"the\r\npressure at the top * * * will * * * increase proportionately to the\r\ndepth.\" Again, the author is apparently not conversant with experiments\r\nmade by the Dock Department of New York City, concerning piles driven in\r\nthe Hudson River silt, which showed that a single heavily loaded pile\r\ncarried downward with it other unloaded piles, driven considerable\r\ndistances away, showing that it was not the pile which lacked in\r\nresistance, as much as the surrounding earth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writer heartily concurs with the statement that \"too\r\nmuch has been taken for granted in connection with earth pressures and\r\nresistance,\" and he is sorry to be forced to add that he believes the\r\nauthor to be open to the criticism which he himself suggests, that \"both\r\nin experimenting and observing, the engineer [and in this case the\r\nauthor] will frequently find what is being looked for or expected and\r\nwill fail to see the obvious alternative.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS L. PRUYN, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--Mr. Meem\r\nshould be congratulated, both in regard to the highly interesting\r\ntheories which he advances on the subject of sand pressures--the\r\npressures of subaqueous material--and on his interesting experiments in\r\nconnection therewith.\r\n\r\nThe experiment in which the plunger on the hydraulic ram is immersed in\r\nsand and covered with water does not seem to be conclusive. By this\r\nexperiment the author attempts to demonstrate that the pressure of the\r\nwater transmitted through the sand is only about 40% as great as when\r\nthe sand is not there. The travel of ground-water through the earth is\r\nat times very slow, and occasionally only at the rate of from 2 to 3 ft.\r\nper hour. In the writer's opinion, Mr. Meem's experiment did not cover\r\nsufficient time during which the pressure was maintained at any given\r\npoint. It is quite probable that it may take 15 or 20 min. for the full\r\npressure to be transmitted through the sand to the bottom of the\r\nplunger, and it is hoped, therefore, that he will make further\r\nexperiments lasting long enough to demonstrate this point.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the question of skin friction on caissons and piles, it may\r\nbe of interest to mention an experiment which the writer made during the\r\nsinking of the large caissons for the Williamsburg Bridge. These\r\ncaissons were about 70 ft. long and 50 ft. wide. The river bottom was\r\nabout 50 ft. below mean high water, and the caissons penetrated sand of\r\ngood quality to a depth of from 90 to 100 ft. below that level. On two\r\noccasions calculations were made to determine the skin friction while\r\nthe caissons were being settled. With the cutting edge from 20 to 30 ft.\r\nbelow the river bottom, the calculations showed that the skin friction\r\nwas between 500 and 600 lb. per sq. ft. The writer agrees with Mr. Meem\r\nthat, in the sinking of caissons, the arch action of sand is, in a great\r\nmeasure, destroyed by the compressed air which escapes under the cutting\r\nedge and percolates up through the material close to the sides of the\r\ncaissons.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the skin friction on piles, the writer agrees with Mr.\r\nMeem that in certain classes of material this is almost a negligible\r\nquantity. The writer has jacked down 9-in. pipes in various parts of New\r\nYork City, and by placing a recording gauge on the hydraulic jack, the\r\nskin friction on the pile could be obtained very accurately. In several\r\ninstances the gauge readings did not vary materially from the surface\r\ndown to a penetration of 50 ft. In these instances the material inside\r\nthe pipe was cleaned out to within 1 ft. of the bottom of the pile, so\r\nthat the gauge reading indicated only the friction on the outside of the\r\npipe plus the bearing value developed by its lower edge. For a 9-in.\r\npipe, the skin friction on the pile plus the bearing area of the bottom\r\nof the pipe seems to be about 20 tons, irrespective of the depth. After\r\nthe pipe had reached sufficient depth, it was concreted, and, after the\r\nconcrete had set, the jack was again placed on it and gauge readings\r\nwere taken. It was found that in ordinary sands the concreted steel pile\r\nwould go down from 3 to 6 in., after which it would bring up to the full\r\ncapacity of a 60-ton jack, showing, by gauge reading, a reaction of from\r\n70 to 80 tons.\r\n\r\nIt is the writer's opinion that, in reasonably compact sands situated at\r\na depth below the surface which will not allow of much lateral movement,\r\na reaction of 100 tons per sq. ft. of area can be obtained without any\r\ndifficulty whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK H. CARTER, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--Mr.\r\nMeem has contributed much that is of value, particularly on water\r\npressures in sand; just what result would be obtained if coarse crushed\r\nstone or similar material were substituted for sand in Experiment No. 6,\r\nis not obvious.\r\n\r\nIt has been the practice lately, among some engineers in Boston, as well\r\nas in New York City, to assume that water pressures on the underside of\r\ninverts is exerted on one-half the area only. The writer, however, has\r\nmade it a practice first to lay a few inches of cracked stone on the\r\nbottom of wet excavations in order to keep water from concrete which is\r\nto be placed in the invert. In addition to the cracked stone under the\r\ninverts, shallow trenches dug laterally across the excavation to insure\r\nmore perfect drainage, have been observed. Both these factors no doubt\r\nassist the free course of water in exerting pressure on the finished\r\ninvert after the underdrains have been closed up on completion of the\r\nwork. The writer, therefore, awaits with interest the repetition of\r\nExperiment No. 6, with water on the bottom of a piston buried in coarse\r\ngravel or cracked stone.\r\n\r\nAs for the arching effect of sand, the writer believes that Mr. Meem has\r\ndemonstrated an important principle, on a small scale. It must be\r\nregretted, however, that the box was not made larger, for, to the\r\nwriter, it appears unsafe to draw such sweeping conclusions from small\r\nexperiments. As small models of sailboats fail to develop completely\r\nlaws for the design and control of large racing yachts, so experiments\r\nin small sand boxes may fail to demonstrate the laws governing actual\r\npressures on full-sized structures.\r\n\r\nFor some time the writer has been using a process of reasoning similar\r\nto that of the author for assumptions of earth pressure on the roofs of\r\ntunnel arches, except that the vertical forces assumed to hold up the\r\nweight of the earth have been ascribed to cohesion and friction, along\r\nwhat might be termed the sides of the \"trench excavation.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer fails to find proof in this paper of the author's statement\r\nthat earth pressures on the sides of a structure buried in earth are\r\ngreater at the top than at the bottom of a trench. That some banks are\r\n\"top-heavy,\" is, no doubt, a fact, the writer having often heard similar\r\nexpressions used by experienced trench foremen, but, in every case\r\ncalled to his attention, local circumstances have caused the\r\ntop-heaviness, either undermining at the bottom of the trench, too much\r\nbanked earth on top, or the earth excavated from the trench being too\r\nnear the edge of the cut.\r\n\r\nFor some years the writer has been making extended observations on deep\r\ntrenches, and, thus far, has failed to find evidence, except in aqueous\r\nmaterial, of earth pressures which might be expected from the known\r\nnatural slope of the material after exposure to the elements; and this\r\nlatter feature may explain why sheeted trenches stand so much better\r\nthan expected. If air had free access to the material, cohesion would be\r\ndestroyed, and theoretical pressures would be more easily developed.\r\nWith closely-sheeted trenches, weathering is practically excluded, and\r\nthe bracing, which seemingly is far too light, holds up the trench with\r\nscarcely a mark of pressure. As an instance, in 1893, the writer was\r\nsuccessfully digging sewer trenches from 10 to 14 ft. deep, through\r\ngravel, in the central part of Connecticut, without bracing; because of\r\ndemands of the work in another part of the city, a length of several\r\nhundred feet of trench was left open for three days, resulting in the\r\ncaving-in of the sides. The elements had destroyed the cohesion, and the\r\nsides of the trenches no longer stood vertically.\r\n\r\nRecently, in the vicinity of Boston, trenches, 32 ft. wide, and from 25\r\nto 35 ft. deep, with heavy buildings on one side, have been braced with\r\n8 by 10-in. stringers, and bracers at 10-ft. centers longitudinally, and\r\nfrom 3 to 5 ft. apart vertically; this timbering apparently was too\r\nslight for pressures which, theoretically, might be expected from the\r\nnatural slope of the material. Just what pressures develop on the sides\r\nof the structures in these deep trenches after pulling the top sheeting\r\n(the bottom sheeting being left in place) is, of course, a matter of\r\nconjecture. There can be no doubt that there is an arching of the\r\nmaterial, as suggested by the author. How much this may be assisted by\r\nthe practical non-disturbance of the virgin material is, of course,\r\nindeterminate. That substructures and retaining walls designed according\r\nto the Rankine or similar theories have an additional factor of safety\r\nfrom too generous an assumption in regard to earth pressure is\r\npractically admitted everywhere. It is almost an engineering axiom that\r\nretaining walls generally fail because of insufficient foundation only.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, and particularly from observations on the\r\neffect of earth pressures on wooden timbers used as bracing, the writer\r\nbelieves that, ordinarily, the theoretical earth pressures computed by\r\nRankine and Coulomb are not realized by one-half, and sometimes not even\r\nby one-third or one-quarter in trenches well under-drained, rapidly\r\nexcavated, and thoroughly braced.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.C. MEEM, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The writer has been\r\nmuch interested in this discussion, and believes that it will be of\r\ngeneral value to the profession. It is unfortunate, however, that\r\nseveral of the points raised have been due to a careless reading of, or\r\nfailure to understand, the paper.\r\n\r\nTaking up the discussion in detail, the writer will first answer the\r\ncriticisms of Mr. Goodrich. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"The writer believes that, in the design of permanent structures,\r\n     consideration of arch action should not be included, at least, not\r\n     until more information has been obtained. He also believes that the\r\n     design of temporary structures with this inclusion is actually\r\n     dangerous in some instances.\"\r\n\r\nIf the arching action of earth exists, why should it not be recognized\r\nand considered? The design of timbering for a structure to rest, for\r\ninstance, at a depth of from 200 to 300 ft. in normal dry earth, without\r\nconsidering this action, would be virtually prohibitive.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodrich proceeds to show one of the dangers of considering such\r\naction by quoting the writer, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"About an hour after the superimposed load had been removed, the\r\n     writer jostled the box with his foot sufficiently to dislodge some\r\n     of the exposed sand, when the arch at once collapsed and the bottom\r\n     fell to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHe fails, as do so many other critics of this theory, to distinguish the\r\ndifference between that portion of the sand which acts as so-called\r\n\"centering\" and that which goes to make up the sustaining arch. The\r\ndislodgment of any large portion of this \"centering\" naturally causes\r\ncollapse, unless it is caught, in which case the void in the \"centering\"\r\nis filled from the material in the sustaining arch, and this, in turn,\r\nis filled from that above, and so on, until the stability of each arch\r\nis in turn finally established. This, however, does not mean that,\r\nduring the process of establishing this equilibrium of the arch\r\nstresses, there is no arching action of any of the material above, but\r\nonly that some of the so-called arches are temporarily sustained by\r\nthose below. That is, in effect, each area of the material above\r\nbecomes, in turn, a dependent, an independent, and finally an\r\ninterdependent arch.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Goodrich's experience has led him to examine any large number of\r\ntunnel arches or brick sewers, he will have noted in many of them\r\nlongitudinal cracks at the soffits of the arches and perhaps elsewhere.\r\nThese result from three causes:\r\n\r\n_First._--In tunneling, there is more or less loss of material, while,\r\nin back-filling, the material does not at first reach its final\r\ncompactness. Therefore, in adjusting itself to normal conditions, this\r\nmaterial causes impact loads to come upon the green arch, and these tend\r\nto crack it.\r\n\r\n_Second._--No matter how tightly a brick or other arch is keyed in,\r\nthere must always be some slight subsidence when the \"centers\" are\r\nstruck. This, again, results in a shock, or impact loading, to the\r\ndetriment of the arch.\r\n\r\n_Third._--The most prolific cause, however, is that in tunneling, as\r\nwell as in back-filling open cuts, the material backing up the haunches\r\nis more or less loosened and therefore is not at first compact enough to\r\nprevent the spreading of the haunches when the load comes on the arch.\r\nThis causes cracking, but, as soon as the haunches have been pressed out\r\nagainst the solid material, the cracking usually ceases, unless the\r\npressure has been sufficiently heavy to cause collapse.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of this was noted in the Joralemon Street branch\r\nof the Rapid Transit Tunnel, in Brooklyn, in which a great many of the\r\ncast-iron rings were cracked under the crown of the arch, during\r\nconstruction; but, in spite of this, they sustained, for more than two\r\nyears, a loading which, according to Mr. Goodrich, was continually\r\nincreasing. In other words, the cracked arch sustained a greater loading\r\nthan that which cracked the plates during construction, according to his\r\ntheory, as noted in the following quotation:\r\n\r\n     \"But it should be equally conceded by the advocates of the\r\n     existence of such action that changes in humidity, due to moving\r\n     water, vibration, and appreciable viscosity, etc., will invariably\r\n     destroy this action in time.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the correctness of this theory Mr. Goodrich would probably have\r\ngreat difficulty in convincing naturalists, who are aware that many\r\nanimals live in enlarged burrows the stability of which is dependent on\r\nthe arching action of the earth; in fact, many of these burrows have\r\nentrances under water. He would also have some difficulty in convincing\r\nthose experienced miners who, after a cave-in, always wait until the\r\nground has settled and compacted itself before tunneling, usually with\r\napparent safety, over the scene of the cave-in.\r\n\r\nThe writer quotes as follows from Mr. Goodrich's discussion:\r\n\r\n     \"In any case, no arch action can be brought into play until a\r\n     certain amount of settlement has taken place so as to bring the\r\n     particles into closer contact, and in such a way that the internal\r\n     stresses are practically those only of compression, and the\r\n     shearing stresses are within the limits possible for the material\r\n     in question.\"\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n     \"Consequently, an almost infinitesimal settlement of the\r\n     'centering' may cause the complete destruction of an arch of\r\n     earth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd further:\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, it is believed that the author's statement, as\r\n     to the 'tendency of marbles to arch,' * * * should be qualified by\r\n     the addition of the words, 'only when a certain amount of\r\n     deflection has taken place so as to bring the arch into action.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a large measure the writer agrees with the first and last quotations,\r\nbut sees no reason to endorse the second, as it is impossible to\r\nconsider any arch being built which does not settle slightly, at least,\r\nwhen the \"centers\" are struck.\r\n\r\nRegarding his criticism of the lack of arching action in balls or\r\nmarbles, he seems to reason that the movement of the marbles would\r\ndestroy the arch action. It is very difficult for the writer to conceive\r\nhow it would be possible for balls or marbles to move when confined as\r\nthey would be confined if the earth were composed of them instead of its\r\npresent ingredients, and under the same conditions otherwise. Mr.\r\nGoodrich can demonstrate the correctness of the writer's theories,\r\nhowever, if he will repeat the writer's Experiment No. 3, with marbles,\r\nwith buckshot, and with dry sand. He is also advised to make the\r\nexperiment with sand and water, described by the writer, and is assured\r\nthat, if he will see that the washers are absolutely tight before\r\nputting the water into the box, he can do this without bringing about\r\nthe collapse of the arch; the only essential condition is that the\r\nbottom shall be keyed up tightly, so as not to allow the escape of any\r\nsand. He is also referred to the two photographs, Plate XXIV,\r\nillustrating the writer's first experiment, showing how increases in the\r\nloading resulted in compacting the material of the arch and in the\r\nconsequent lowering of the false bottom. As long as the exposed sand\r\nabove this false bottom had cohesion enough to prevent the collapse of\r\nthe \"centering,\" this arch could have been loaded with safety up to the\r\nlimits of the compressive strength of the sand.\r\n\r\nTo quote again from Mr. Goodrich:\r\n\r\n     \"Furthermore, the author's reason for bisecting the angle between\r\n     the vertical and the angle of repose of the material, when he\r\n     undertakes to determine the thickness of key, is not obvious. This\r\n     assumption is shown to be absurd when carried to either limit, for\r\n     when the angle of repose equals zero, as is the case with water,\r\n     this method would give a definite thickness of key, while there can\r\n     be absolutely no arch action possible in such a case; and, when the\r\n     angle of repose is 90°, as may be assumed in the case of rock, this\r\n     method would give an infinite thickness of key, which is again seen\r\n     to be absurd.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Goodrich assumes that water or liquid has an angle of repose equal\r\nto zero, which is true, but the writer's assumptions applied only to\r\nsolid material, and the liquid gives an essentially different condition\r\nof pressure, as shown by a careful reading of the paper. In solid rock\r\nMr. Goodrich assumes an angle of repose equal to 90°, for which there is\r\nno authority; that is, solid rock has no known angle of repose. In order\r\nto carry these assumptions to a definite conclusion, we must assume for\r\nthat material with an angle of repose of 90° some solid material which\r\nhas weight but no thrust, such as blocks of ice piled vertically. In\r\nthis case Mr. Goodrich can readily see that there will be no arching\r\naction over the structure, and that the required thickness of key would\r\nbe infinite. As to the other case, it is somewhat difficult to conceive\r\nof a solid with an angle of repose of zero; aqueous material does not\r\nfulfill this condition, as it is either a liquid or a combination of\r\nwater and solid material. The best illustration, perhaps, would be to\r\nassume a material composed of iron filings, into which had been driven a\r\npowerful magnet, so that the iron filings would be drawn horizontally in\r\none direction. It is easy to conceive, then, that in tunneling through\r\nthis material there would be no necessity for holding up the roof; the\r\ndefinite thickness of key given, as being at the point of intersection\r\nof two 45° angles, would be merely a precautionary measure, and would\r\nnot be required in practice.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that both these conditions can be fulfilled with\r\npractical illustrations; that is, for an angle of repose of 90°, that\r\nmaterial which has weight and no thrust, and for an angle of repose of\r\nzero, that solid material which has thrust but no weight.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodrich says the author has given no experiments to prove his\r\nstatement that the arch thrust is greater in dryer sand. If Mr. Goodrich\r\nwill make the experiment partially described as Experiment No. 3, with\r\nabsolutely dry sand, and with moist sand, and on a scale large enough\r\nto eliminate cohesion, he will probably find enough to convince him that\r\nin this assumption the writer is correct. At the same time, the writer\r\nhas based his theory in this regard on facts which are not entirely\r\nconclusive, and his mind is open as to what future experiments on a\r\nlarge scale may develop. It is very probable, however, that an\r\nanalytical and practical examination of the English experiments noted on\r\npages 379 and 380, will be sufficient to develop this fact conclusively.\r\n\r\nThe writer is forced to conclude that some of the criticisms by Mr.\r\nGoodrich result from a not too careful reading of the paper. For\r\ninstance, he states:\r\n\r\n     \"'It is conceded' (line 2, p. 357, for example) when the writer,\r\n     for one, has not even conceded the accuracy of the assumptions.\"\r\n\r\nA more careful reading would have shown Mr. Goodrich that this\r\nconcession was one of the writer's as to certain pressures against or on\r\ntunnels, and, if Mr. Goodrich does not concede this, he is even more\r\nradical than the writer.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     \"'Nor can anyone * * * doubt that the top timbers are stressed more\r\n     heavily than those at the bottom' is emphatically doubted and\r\n     earnestly denied by the writer.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Mr. Goodrich failed to make the complete\r\nquotation, which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"Nor can anyone, looking at Fig. 5, doubt,\" etc.\r\n\r\nA glance at Fig. 5 will demonstrate that, under conditions there set\r\nforth, the writer is probably correct in his assertion as relating to\r\nthat particular instance. Further:\r\n\r\n     \"For instance, the author's well-known theory that the pressures\r\n     against retaining walls are a maximum at the top and decrease to\r\n     zero at the bottom, is in absolute contradiction to the results of\r\n     experiments conducted on a large scale by the writer on the new\r\n     reinforced concrete retaining wall near the St. George Ferry, on\r\n     Staten Island.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer's \"well-known theory that pressures against retaining walls\r\nare a maximum at the top and decrease to zero at the bottom\" applies\r\nonly to pressures exerted by absolutely dry and normally dry material,\r\nand it seems to him that this so-called theory is capable of such easy\r\ndemonstration, by the simple observation of any bracing in a deep trench\r\nin material of this class, that it ought to be accepted as at least\r\nsafer than the old theory which it reverses. As to this \"well-known\r\ntheory\" in material subject to water pressure, a careful reading of the\r\npaper, or an examination of Fig. 12 and its accompanying text, or an\r\nexamination of Table 1, will convince Mr. Goodrich that, under the\r\nwriter's analysis, this pressure does not decrease to zero at the\r\nbottom, but that in soft materials it may be approximately constant all\r\nthe way down, while, in exceptionally soft material, conditions may\r\narise where it may increase toward the bottom. The determination should\r\nbe made by taking the solid material and drying it sufficiently so that\r\nwater does not flow or seep from it. When this material is then\r\ncompacted to the condition in which it would be in its natural state,\r\nits angle of repose may be measured, and may be found to be as high as\r\n60 degrees. The very fine matter should then be separated from the\r\ncoarser material, and the latter weighed, to determine its proportion.\r\nSubtracting this from the total, the remainder could be credited to\r\n\"aqueous matter.\" It is thus seen that with a material when partially\r\ndried in which the natural angle of repose might be 60°, and in which\r\nthe percentage of water or aqueous matter when submerged might be 60%,\r\nthere would be an increase of pressure toward the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not know the exact nature of the experiments made at St.\r\nGeorge's Ferry by Mr. Goodrich, but he supposes they were measurements\r\nof pressures on pistons through holes in the sheeting. He desires to\r\nstate again that he cannot regard such experiments as conclusive, and\r\nbelieves that they are of comparative value only, as such experiments do\r\nnot measure in any large degree the pressure of the solid material but\r\nonly all or a portion of the so-called aqueous matter, that is, the\r\nliquid and very fine material which flows with it. Thus it is well known\r\nthat, during the construction of the recent Hudson and North River\r\nTunnels, pressures were tested in the silt, some of which showed that\r\nthe silt exerted full hydrostatic pressure. At the same time, W.I. Aims,\r\nM. Am. Soc. C. E., stated in a public lecture, and recently also to the\r\nwriter, that in 1890 he made some tests of the pressure of this silt in\r\nnormal air for the late W.R. Hutton, M. Am. Soc. C. E. A hole, 12 in.\r\nsquare, was cut through the brickwork and the iron lining, just back of\r\nthe lock in the north tube (in normal air), and about 1000 ft. from the\r\nNew Jersey shore. It was found that the silt had become so firm that it\r\ndid not flow into the opening. Later, a 4-in. collar and piston were\r\nbuilt into the opening, and, during a period covering at least 3 months,\r\nconstant observations showed that no pressure came upon it; in fact, it\r\nwas stated that the piston was frequently worked back and forth to\r\ninduce pressure, but no response was obtained during all this period.\r\nThe conclusion must then be drawn that when construction, with its\r\nattendant disturbance, has stopped, the solid material surrounding\r\nstructures tends to compact itself more or less, and solidify, according\r\nas it is more or less porous, forming in many instances what may be\r\nvirtually a compact arch shutting off a large percentage of the normal,\r\nand some percentage even of the aqueous, pressure.\r\n\r\nThat the pressure of normally dry material cannot be measured through\r\nsmall openings can be verified by any one who will examine such material\r\nback of bracing showing evidences of heavy pressure. The investigator\r\nwill find that, if this material is free from water pressure, paper\r\nstuffed lightly into small openings will hold back indefinitely material\r\nwhich in large masses has frequently caused bracing to buckle and\r\nsheeting planks to bend and break; and the writer reiterates that such\r\nexperiments should be made in trenches sheeted with horizontal sheeting\r\nbearing against short vertical rangers and braces giving horizontal\r\nsections absolutely detached and independent of each other. In no other\r\nway can such experiments be of real value (and even then only when made\r\non a large scale) to determine conclusively the pressure of earth on\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nAs to the questions of the relative thrust of materials under various\r\nangles of repose, and of the necessity of dividing by the tangent, etc.;\r\nthese, to the writer, seem to be merely the solution of problems in\r\nsimple graphics.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that if Mr. Goodrich will make, even on a small\r\nscale, some of the experiments noted by the writer, he will be convinced\r\nthat many of the assumptions which he cannot at present endorse are\r\nbased on fact, and his co-operation will be welcomed with the greatest\r\ninterest. Among the experiments which he is asked to make is the one in\r\ndry sand, noted as Experiment No. 3, whereby it can be shown very\r\nconclusively that additional back-fill will result in increased arching\r\nstability, on an arch which would collapse under lighter loading.\r\n\r\nThe writer is indebted to Mr. Goodrich for pointing out some errors in\r\nomission and in typography (now corrected), and for his hearty\r\nconcurrence in some of the assumptions which the writer believed would\r\nmeet with greatest disapproval.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Mr. Pruyn and Mr. Gregory, the writer assumed that the\r\npiston area in Experiment No. 6 should be reduced only by the actual\r\ncontact of material with it. If this material in contact should be\r\ncomposed of theoretical spheres, resulting in a contact with points\r\nonly, then the theoretical area reduced should be in proportion to this\r\namount only. The writer does not believe, however, that this condition\r\nexists in practice, but thinks that the area is reduced very much more\r\nthan by the actual theoretical contact of the material. He sees no\r\nreason, as far as he has gone, to doubt the accuracy of the deductions\r\nfrom this experiment.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of the length of time required to raise the\r\npiston, he does not believe that the position of his critics is entirely\r\ncorrect in this matter; that is, it must either be conceded that the\r\npiston area is cut off from the source of pressure, or that it is in\r\ncontact with it through more or less minute channels of water. If it is\r\ncut off, then the writer's contention is proved without the need of the\r\nexperiment, and it is therefore conclusive that a submerged tunnel is\r\nnot under aqueous pressure or the buoyant action of water. If, on the\r\nother hand, the water is in contact through channels bearing directly\r\nupon the piston and leading to the clear water chamber, any increase in\r\npressure in the water chamber must necessarily result in a virtually\r\ninstantaneous increase of the pressure against the piston, and therefore\r\nthe action on the latter should follow almost immediately. In all cases\r\nduring the experiments the piston did not respond until the pressure was\r\napproximately twice as great as required in clear water, therefore the\r\nwriter must conclude either that the experiments proved it conclusively\r\nor that his assumption is proved without the necessity of the\r\nexperiments. That is, the pressure is virtually not in evidence until\r\nthe piston has commenced to move.\r\n\r\nMr. Pruyn has added valuable information in his presentation of data\r\nobtained from specific tests of the bearing value of, and friction on,\r\nhollow steel piles. These data largely corroborate tests and\r\nobservations by the writer, and are commended to general attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter's information is also of special interest to the writer, as\r\nmuch of it is in the line of confirming his views. Mr. Carter does not\r\nyet accept the theory of increased pressure toward the top, but if he\r\nwill examine or experiment with heavy bracing in deep trenches in clear\r\nsand, or material with well-defined angles of repose, he will probably\r\nfind much to help him toward the acceptance of this view.\r\n\r\nThe writer regrets that he has not now the means or appliances for\r\nfurther experiments with the piston chamber, but he does not believe\r\nthat reliable results could be obtained in broken stone with so small a\r\npiston, as it is possible that the point of one stone only might be in\r\ncontact with the piston. This would naturally leave the base exposed\r\nalmost wholly to a clear water area. He does not believe, however, that\r\nin practice the laying of broken stone under inverts will materially\r\nchange the ultimate pressure unless its cross-section represents a large\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMr. Perry will find the following on page 369:\r\n\r\n     \"It should be noted also that although the area subject to pressure\r\n     is diminished, the pressure on the area remaining corresponds to\r\n     the full hydrostatic head, as would be shown by the pressure on an\r\n     air gauge.\"\r\n\r\nThis, of course, depends on the porosity of the material and the\r\nfriction the water meets in passing through it.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Thomson's discussion, the writer notes with regret two points:\r\n(_a_) that specific data are not given in many of the interesting cases\r\nof failures of certain structures or bracing; and (_b_), that he has\r\nnot in all cases a clear understanding of the paper. For instance, the\r\nwriter has not advocated the omission of bottom bracing or sheeting. He\r\nhas seen many instances where it has been, or could have been, safely\r\nomitted, but he desires to make it clear that he does not under any\r\ncircumstances advocate its omission in good work; but only that, in\r\nwell-designed bracing, its strength may be decreased as it approaches\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nReference is again made to the diagram, Fig. 12, which shows that, in\r\nmost cases of coffer-dams in combined aqueous and earth pressure, there\r\nmay be nearly equal, and in some cases even greater, loading toward the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe writer also specifically states that in air the difference between\r\naqueous and earth pressure is plainly noted by the fact that bracing is\r\nneeded so frequently to hold back the earth while the air is keeping out\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe lack of specific data is especially noticeable in the account of the\r\nrise of the 6-ft. conduit at Toronto. It would be of great interest to\r\nknow with certainly the weight of the pipe per foot, and whether it was\r\nproperly bedded and properly back-filled. In all probability the\r\nback-filling over certain areas was not properly done, and as the pipe\r\nwas exposed to an upward pressure of nearly 1600 lb. per ft., with\r\nprobably only 500 or 600 lb. of weight to counterbalance it, it can\r\nreadily be seen that it did not conform with the writer's general\r\nsuggestion, that structures not compactly, or only partially, buried,\r\nshould have a large factor of safety against the upward pressure.\r\nOpposed to Mr. Thomson's experience in this instance is the fact that\r\noftentimes the tunnels under the East River approached very close to the\r\nsurface, with the material above them so soupy (owing to the escape of\r\ncompressed air) that their upper surfaces were temporarily in water, yet\r\nthere was no instance in which they rose, although some of them were\r\nunder excessive buoyant pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to note, from the papers descriptive of the North\r\nRiver Tunnel, that, with shield doors closed, the shield tended to rise,\r\nwhile by opening the doors to take in muck the shield could be brought\r\ndown or kept down. The writer concurs with those who believe that the\r\nrising of the shield with closed doors was due to the slightly greater\r\ndensity of the material below, and was not in any way due to buoyancy.\r\n\r\nConcerning the collapse of the bracing in the tunnel built under a\r\nside-hill, the writer believes it was due to the fact that it was under\r\na sliding side-hill, and that, if it had been possible to have\r\nback-filled over and above this tunnel to a very large extent, this\r\nback-fill would have resulted in checking the sliding of material\r\nagainst the tunnel, and the work would thereafter have been done with\r\nsafety. This is corroborated by Mr. Thomson's statement that the tunnel\r\nwas subsequently carried through safely by going farther into the hill.\r\n\r\nAs to the angle of repose, Mr. Thomson seems to feel that its\r\ndetermination is so often impracticable that it is not to be relied on;\r\nand yet all calculations pertaining to earth pressure must be based on\r\nthis factor. The writer believes that the angle of repose is not\r\ndifficult to determine, and that observations of, and experiments on,\r\nexposed banks in similar material, and general experience in relation\r\nthereto, will enable one to determine it in nearly all cases within such\r\nreasonably accurate limits that only a small margin of safety need be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nEngineers are sent to Europe to study sewage disposal, water\r\npurification, transit problems, etc., but are rarely sent to an\r\nadjoining county or State to look at an exposed bank, which would\r\nperhaps solve a vexed problem in bracing and result in great economy in\r\nthe design of permanent structures.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomson's general views seem to indicate that much of the subject\r\nmatter noted in the paper relates to unsolvable problems, for it appears\r\nthat in many cases he believes the Engineer to be dependent on his\r\neducated guess, backed perhaps by the experienced guess of the foreman\r\nor practical man. The writer, on the contrary, believes that every\r\nproblem relating to work of this class is capable of being solved,\r\nwithin reasonably accurate limits, and that the time is not far distant\r\nwhen the engineer, with his study of conditions, and samples of material\r\nbefore him, will be able to solve his earth pressure and earth\r\nresistance problems as accurately as the bridge engineer, with his\r\nknowledge of structural materials, solves bridge problems.\r\n\r\nThe writer, in the course of his experience, has met with or been\r\ninterested in the solution of many problems similar to the following:\r\n\r\nWhat difference in timbering should be made for a tunnel in ordinary,\r\nnormally dry ground at a depth of 20 ft. to the roof, as compared with\r\none at a depth of 90 ft.?\r\n\r\nWhat difference in timbering or in permanent design should be made for a\r\nhorizontally-sheeted shaft, 5 ft. square, going to a depth of 45 ft. and\r\none 25 by 70 ft., for instance, going to the same depth, assuming each\r\nto be braced and sheeted horizontally with independent bracing?\r\n\r\nWhat allowance should be made for the strength of interlock, assuming\r\nthat a circular bulkhead of sand, 30 ft. in diameter, is to be carried\r\nby steel sheet-piling exposed around the outside for a depth of 40 ft.?\r\n\r\nWhat average pressure per square foot of area should be required to\r\ndrive a section of a 3 by 15-ft. roof shield, as compared with the\r\npressure needed to drive the whole roof shield with an area four times\r\nas great?\r\n\r\nTo what depth could a 12 by 12-in. timber be driven, under gradually\r\nadded pressure, up to 60 tons, for instance, in normal sand?\r\n\r\nWhat frictional resistance should be assumed on a hollow, steel,\r\nsmooth-bore pile which had been driven through sharp sand and had\r\npenetrated soft, marshy material the bearing resistance of which was\r\npractically valueless?\r\n\r\nWhat allowance should be made for the buoyancy of a tunnel 20 ft. in\r\ndiameter, the top of which was buried to a depth of 20 ft. in sand above\r\nwhich there was 40 ft. of water?\r\n\r\nIt is believed by the writer that most of the authorities are silent as\r\nto the solution of problems similar to the above, and it is because of\r\nthis lack of available data that he has directed his studies to them.\r\nThe belief that the results of these studies, together with such\r\nobservations and experiments as relate thereto, may be of interest, has\r\ncaused him to set them forth in this paper.\r\n\r\nHe desires to state his belief that if problems similar to the above\r\nwere given for definite solution, not based on ordinary safe practice,\r\nand without conference, to a number of engineers prominently interested\r\nin such matters, the results would vary so widely as to convince some of\r\nthe critics of this paper that the greater danger lies rather in the\r\nnon-exploration of such fields than in the setting forth of results of\r\nexploration which may appear to be somewhat radical.\r\n\r\nFurther, if these views result in stimulating enough interest to lead to\r\nthe hope that eventually the \"Pressure, Resistance, and Stability\" of\r\nground under varying conditions will be known within reasonably accurate\r\nlimits and tabulated, the writer will feel that his efforts have not\r\nbeen in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: \"Lateral Earth Pressures and Related Phenomena,\"\r\n_Transactions_, Am.
