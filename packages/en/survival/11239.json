WHITTINGHAM;\r\n\r\nFOR J. CARPENTER, OLD BOND STREET; J. BOOKER, NEW BOND\r\nSTREET; SHARPS AND HAILES, MUSEUM, PICCADILLY; AND\r\nGALE, CURTIS, AND FENNER, PATERNOSTER ROW; LONDON.\r\n\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF\r\n\r\n_DANIEL DE FOE_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel De Foe was descended from a respectable family in the county of\r\nNorthampton, and born in London, about the year 1663. His father, James\r\nFoe, was a butcher, in the parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and a\r\nprotestant dissenter. Why the subject of this memoir prefixed the _De_\r\nto his family name cannot now be ascertained, nor did he at any period\r\nof his life think it necessary to give his reasons to the public. The\r\npolitical scribblers of the day, however, thought proper to remedy this\r\nlack of information, and accused him of possessing so little of the\r\n_amor patriae_, as to make the addition in order that he might not be\r\ntaken for an Englishman; though this idea could have had no other\r\nfoundation than the circumstance of his having, in consequence of his\r\nzeal for King William, attacked the prejudices of his countrymen in his\r\n\"Trueborn Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nAfter receiving a good education at an academy at Newington, young De\r\nFoe, before he had attained his twenty-first year, commenced his career\r\nas an author, by writing a pamphlet against a very prevailing sentiment\r\nin favour of the Turks, who were at that time laying siege to Vienna.\r\nThis production, being very inferior to those of his maturer years, was\r\nvery little read, and the indignant author, despairing of success with\r\nhis pen, had recourse to the sword; or, as he termed it, when boasting\r\nof the exploit in his latter years, \"displayed his attachment to liberty\r\nand protestanism,\" by joining the ill-advised insurrection under the\r\nDuke of Monmouth, in the west. On the failure of that unfortunate\r\nenterprise, he returned again to the metropolis; and it is not\r\nimprobable, but that the circumstance of his being a native of London,\r\nand his person not much known in that part of the kingdom where the\r\nrebellion took place, might facilitate his escape, and be the means of\r\npreventing his being brought to trial for his share in the transaction.\r\nWith the professions of a writer and a soldier, Mr. De Foe, in the year\r\n1685, joined that of a trader; he was first engaged as a hosier, in\r\nCornhill, and afterwards as a maker of bricks and pantiles, near Tilbury\r\nFort, in Essex; but in consequence of spending those hours in the\r\nhilarity of the tavern which he ought to have employed in the\r\ncalculations of the counting-house, his commercial schemes proved\r\nunsuccessful; and in 1694 he was obliged to abscond from his creditors,\r\nnot failing to attribute those misfortunes to the war and the severity\r\nof the times, which were doubtless owing to his own misconduct. It is\r\nmuch to his credit, however, that after having been freed from his debts\r\nby composition, and being in prosperous circumstances from King\r\nWilliam's favour, he voluntarily paid most of his creditors both the\r\nprincipal and interest of their claims. This is such an example of\r\nhonesty as it would be unjust to De Foe and to the world to conceal. The\r\namount of the sums thus paid must have been very considerable, as he\r\nafterwards feelingly mentions to Lord Haversham, who had reproached him\r\nwith covetousness; \"With a numerous family, and no helps but my own\r\nindustry, I have forced my way through a sea of misfortunes, and reduced\r\nmy debts, exclusive of composition, from seventeen thousand to less than\r\nfive thousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1700, Mr. De Foe published a satire in\r\nverse, which excited very considerable attention, called the \"Trueborn\r\nEnglishman.\" Its purpose was to furnish a reply to those who were\r\ncontinually abusing King William and some of his friends as\r\n_foreigners_, by showing that the present race of Englishmen was a mixed\r\nand heterogeneous brood, scarcely any of which could lay claim to native\r\npurity of blood. The satire was in many parts very severe; and though it\r\ngave high offence, it claimed a considerable share of the public\r\nattention. The reader will perhaps be gratified by a specimen of this\r\nproduction, wherein he endeavours to account for--\r\n\r\n     \"What makes this discontented land appear\r\n     Less happy now in times of peace, than war;\r\n     Why civil fends disturb the nation more,\r\n     Than all our bloody wars had done before:\r\n     Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place,\r\n     And men are always honest in disgrace:\r\n     The court preferments make men knaves in course,\r\n     But they, who would be in them, would be worse.\r\n     'Tis not at foreigners that we repine,\r\n     Would foreigners their perquisites resign:\r\n     The grand contention's plainly to be seen,\r\n     To get some men put out, and some put in.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be immediately perceived that De Foe could have no pretensions\r\nto the character of a _poet_; but he has, notwithstanding, some nervous\r\nand well-versified lines, and in choice of subject and moral he is in\r\ngeneral excellent. The Trueborn Englishman concludes thus:\r\n\r\n     Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,\r\n     And see their offspring thus degenerate;\r\n     How we contend for birth and names unknown,\r\n     And build on their past actions, not our own;\r\n     They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,\r\n     And openly disown the vile degenerate race.\r\n     For fame of families is all a cheat;\r\n     'TIS PERSONAL VIRTUE ONLY MAKES US GREAT.\r\n\r\nFor this defence of foreigners De Foe was amply rewarded by King\r\nWilliam, who not only ordered him a pension, but, as his opponents\r\ndenominated it, appointed him _pamphlet-writer general to the court_; an\r\noffice for which he was peculiarly well calculated, possessing, with a\r\nstrong mind and a ready wit, that kind of yielding conscience which\r\nallowed him to support the measures of his benefactors, though convinced\r\nthey were injurious to his country. De Foe now retired to Newington with\r\nhis family, and for a short time lived at ease; but the death of his\r\nroyal patron deprived him of a generous protector, and opened a scene of\r\nsorrow which probably embittered his future life.\r\n\r\nHe had always discovered a great inclination to engage in religious\r\ncontroversy, and the furious contest, civil and ecclesiastical, which\r\nensued on the accession of Queen Anne, gave him an opportunity of\r\ngratifying his favourite passion. He therefore published a tract,\r\nentitled \"The shortest Way with the Dissenters, or Proposals for the\r\nEstablishment of the Church,\" which contained an ironical recommendation\r\nof persecution, but written in so serious a strain, that many persons,\r\nparticularly Dissenters, at first mistook its real intention. The high\r\nchurch party however saw, and felt the ridicule, and, by their\r\ninfluence, a prosecution was commenced against him, and a proclamation\r\npublished in the Gazette, offering a reward for his apprehension[1].\r\nWhen De Foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet were\r\nabout to be treated, he at first secreted himself; but his printer and\r\nbookseller being taken into custody, he surrendered, being resolved, as\r\nhe expresses it, \"to throw himself upon the favour of government, rather\r\nthan that others should be ruined for his mistakes.\" In July, 1703, he\r\nwas brought to trial, found guilty, and sentenced to be imprisoned, to\r\nstand in the pillory, and to pay a fine of two hundred marks. He\r\nunderwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude, and\r\nit seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with\r\nunreasonable severity. So far was he from being ashamed of his fate\r\nhimself, that he wrote a hymn to the pillory, which thus ends, alluding\r\nto his accusers:\r\n\r\n     Tell them, the men that plac'd him here\r\n     Are scandals to the times;\r\n     Are at a loss to find his guilt,\r\n     And can't commit his crimes.\r\n\r\nPope, who has thought fit to introduce him in his Dunciad, (probably\r\nfrom no other reason than party difference) characterizes him in the\r\nfollowing line:\r\n\r\n     Earless on high stood unabash'd De Foe.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those instances of injustice and malignity which so\r\nfrequently occur in the Dunciad, and which reflect more dishonour on the\r\nauthor than on the parties traduced. De Foe lay friendless and\r\ndistressed in Newgate, his family ruined, and himself without hopes of\r\ndeliverance, till Sir Robert Harley, who approved of his principles, and\r\nforesaw that during a factious age such a genius could be converted to\r\nmany uses, represented his unmerited sufferings to the Queen, and at\r\nlength procured his release. The treasurer, Lord Godolphin, also sent a\r\nconsiderable sum to his wife and family, and to him money to pay his\r\nfine and the expense of his discharge. Gratitude and fidelity are\r\ninseparable from an honest man; and it was this benevolent act that\r\nprompted De Foe to support Harley, with his able and ingenious pen, when\r\nAnne lay lifeless, and his benefactor in the vicissitude of party was\r\npersecuted by faction, and overpowered, though not conquered,\r\nby violence.\r\n\r\nThe talents and perseverance of De Foe began now to be properly\r\nestimated, and as a firm supporter of the administration, he was sent by\r\nLord Godolphin to Scotland, on an errand which, as he says, was far from\r\nbeing unfit for a sovereign to direct, or an honest man to perform. His\r\nknowledge of commerce and revenue, his powers of insinuation, and, above\r\nall, his readiness of pen, were deemed of no small utility in promoting\r\nthe union of the two kingdoms; of which he wrote an able history in\r\n1709, with two dedications, one to the Queen, and another to the Duke of\r\nQueensbury. Soon afterwards he unhappily, by some equivocal writings,\r\nrendered himself suspected by both parties, so that he once more retired\r\nto Newington, in hopes of spending the remainder of his days in peace.\r\nHis pension being withdrawn, and wearied with politics, he began to\r\ncompose works of a different kind.--The year 1715 may therefore be\r\nregarded as the period of De Foe's political life. Faction henceforth\r\nfound other advocates, and parties procured other writers to disseminate\r\ntheir suggestions, and to propagate their falsehoods.\r\n\r\nIn 1715 De Foe published the \"Family Instructor;\" a work inculcating the\r\ndomestic duties in a lively manner, by narration and dialogue, and\r\ndisplaying much knowledge of life in the middle ranks of society.\r\n\"Religious Courtship\" also appeared soon after, which, like the \"Family\r\nInstructor,\" is eminently religious and moral in its tendency, and\r\nstrongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety and private\r\ndevotion for which the dissenters have generally been distinguished. The\r\nmost celebrated of all his works, \"The Life and Adventures of Robinson\r\nCrusoe,\" appeared in 1719. This work has passed through numerous\r\neditions, and been translated into almost all modern languages. The\r\ngreat invention which is displayed in it, the variety of incidents and\r\ncircumstances which it contains, related in the most easy and natural\r\nmanner, together with the excellency of the moral and religious\r\nreflections, render it a performance of very superior and uncommon\r\nmerit, and one of the most interesting works that ever appeared. It is\r\nstrongly recommended by Rosseau as a book admirably calculated to\r\npromote the purposes of natural education; and Dr. Blair says, \"No\r\nfiction, in any language, was ever better supported than the Adventures\r\nof Robinson Crusoe. While it is carried on with that appearance of truth\r\nand simplicity, which takes a strong hold of the imagination of all\r\nreaders, it suggests, at the same time, very useful instruction; by\r\nshowing how much the native powers of man may be exerted for\r\nsurmounting the difficulties of any external situation.\" It has been\r\npretended, that De Foe surreptitiously appropriated the papers of\r\nAlexander Selkirk, a Scotch mariner, who lived four years alone on the\r\nisland of Juan Fernandez, and a sketch of whose story had before\r\nappeared in the voyage of Captain Woodes Rogers. But this charge, though\r\nrepeatedly and confidently brought, appears to be totally destitute of\r\nany foundation. De Foe probably took some general hints for his work\r\nfrom the story of Selkirk, but there exists no proof whatever, nor is it\r\nreasonable to suppose that he possessed any of his papers or memoirs,\r\nwhich had been published seven years before the appearance of Robinson\r\nCrusoe. As a farther proof of De Foe's innocence, Captain Rogers'\r\nAccount of Selkirk may be produced, in which it is said that the latter\r\nhad neither preserved pen, ink, or paper, and had, in a great measure,\r\nlost his language; consequently De Foe could not have received any\r\nwritten assistance, and we have only the assertion of his enemies to\r\nprove that he had any verbal.\r\n\r\nThe great success of Robinson Crusoe induced its author to write a\r\nnumber of other lives and adventures, some of which were popular in\r\ntheir times, though at present nearly forgotten. One of his latest\r\npublications was \"A Tour through the Island of Great Britain,\" a\r\nperformance of very inferior merit; but De Foe was now the garrulous\r\nold man, and his spirit (to use the words of an ingenious biographer)\r\n\"like a candle struggling in the socket, blazed and sunk, blazed and\r\nsunk, till it disappeared at length in total darkness.\" His laborious\r\nand unfortunate life was finished on the 26th of April, 1731, in' the\r\nparish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate.\r\n\r\nDaniel De Foe possessed very extraordinary talents; as a commercial\r\nwriter, he is fairly entitled to stand in the foremost rank among his\r\ncontemporaries, whatever may be their performances or their fame. His\r\ndistinguishing characteristics are originality, spirit, and a profound\r\nknowledge of his subject, and in these particulars he has seldom been\r\nsurpassed. As the author of Robinson Crusoe he has a claim, not only to\r\nthe admiration, but to the gratitude of his countrymen; and so long as\r\nwe have a regard for supereminent merit, and take an interest in the\r\nwelfare of the rising generation, that gratitude will not cease to\r\nexist. But the opinion of the learned and ingenious Dr. Beattie will be\r\nthe best eulogium that can be pronounced on that celebrated romance:\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe,\" says the Doctor, \"must be allowed, by the most rigid\r\nmoralist, to be one of those novels which one may read, riot only with\r\npleasure, but also with profit. It breathes throughout a spirit of\r\npiety and benevolence; it sets in a very striking light the importance\r\nof the mechanic arts, which they, who know not what it is to be without\r\nthem, are so apt to under-value; it fixes in the mind a lively idea of\r\nthe horrors of solitude, and, consequently, of the sweets of social\r\nlife, and of the blessings we derive from conversation and mutual aid;\r\nand it shows how, by labouring with one's own hands, one may secure\r\nindependence, and open for one's self many sources of health and\r\namusement. I agree, therefore, with Rosseau, that it is one of the best\r\nbooks that can be put into the hands of children.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _St. James's, January 10, 1702-5._ \"Whereas Daniel De Foe,\r\nalias De Fooe, is charged with writing a scandalous and seditious\r\npamphlet, entitled 'The shortest Way with the Dissenters:' he is a\r\nmiddle-sized spare man, about 40 years old, of a brown complexion, and\r\ndark-brown coloured hair, but wears a wig, a hooked nose, a sharp chin,\r\ngrey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth, was born in London, and for\r\nmany years was a hose-factor, in Freeman's Yard, in Cornhill, and now is\r\nowner of the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort, in Essex;\r\nwhoever shall discover the said Daniel De Foe, to one of her Majesty's\r\nPrincipal Secretaries of State, or any of her Majesty's Justices of\r\nPeace, so as he may be apprehended, shall have a reward of £50, which\r\nher Majesty has ordered immediately to be paid upon such discovery.\"\r\n_London Gaz._ No. 3879.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nLIFE AND ADVENTURES\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\nI was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\r\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\r\nsettled first at Hull: he got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\r\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married my\r\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\r\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\r\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay we call\r\nourselves, and write, our name Crusoe; and so my companions always\r\ncalled me.\r\n\r\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\r\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\r\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\r\nSpaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\r\nmy father or mother did know what was become of me.\r\n\r\nBeing the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head\r\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts: my father, who was\r\nvery ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\r\nhouse-education and a country free-school generally go, and designed me\r\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and\r\nmy inclination to this led me so strongly, against the will, nay, the\r\ncommands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of\r\nmy mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in\r\nthat propension of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which\r\nwas to befall me.\r\n\r\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\r\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his\r\nchamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly\r\nwith me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere\r\nwandering inclination I had for leaving my father's house and my native\r\ncountry, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising\r\nmy fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\r\npleasure. He told me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand,\r\nor of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\r\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\r\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\r\nall either too far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the\r\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\r\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world,\r\nthe most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and\r\nhardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind,\r\nand not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the\r\nupper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the happiness of\r\nthis state by one thing, viz. that this was the state of life which all\r\nother people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable\r\nconsequences of being born to great things, and wish they had been\r\nplaced in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the\r\ngreat; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just\r\nstandard of true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty\r\nnor riches.\r\n\r\nHe bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities of\r\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind; but that the\r\nmiddle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many\r\nvicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not\r\nsubjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or\r\nmind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances,\r\non one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean and\r\ninsufficient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves\r\nby the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle\r\nstation of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of\r\nenjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle\r\nfortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all\r\nagreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings\r\nattending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently\r\nand smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not\r\nembarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to\r\nthe life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed\r\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest; not\r\nenraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for\r\ngreat things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the\r\nworld, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter,\r\nfeeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's experience to\r\nknow it more sensibly.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\r\nmanner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself into\r\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\r\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\r\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\r\ninto the station of life which he had been just recommending to me; and\r\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\r\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\r\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\r\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as he would\r\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\r\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to\r\ngive me any encouragement to go away: and to close all, he told me I had\r\nmy elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest\r\npersuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could\r\nnot prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where\r\nhe was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet\r\nhe would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God\r\nwould not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon\r\nhaving neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in\r\nmy recovery.\r\n\r\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\r\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself;\r\nI say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, and\r\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\r\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\r\nmoved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was so\r\nfull he could say no more to me.\r\n\r\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could be\r\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\r\nsettle at home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days\r\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further\r\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\r\nhim. However, I did not act so hastily neither as my first heat of\r\nresolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I thought her\r\na little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were\r\nso entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle to\r\nany thing with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\r\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\r\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\r\ntrade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I should\r\nnever serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from my master\r\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\r\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not\r\nlike it, I would go no more, and I would promise, by a double diligence,\r\nto recover that time I had lost.\r\n\r\nThis put my mother into a great passion: she told me, she knew it would\r\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\r\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to any such thing\r\nso much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\r\nthing after such a discourse as I had had with my father, and such kind\r\nand tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that,\r\nin short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\r\ndepend I should never have their consent to it: that for her part, she\r\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\r\nit to say, that my mother was willing when my father was not.\r\n\r\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as I have heard\r\nafterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father,\r\nafter showing a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, \"That boy\r\nmight be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will\r\nbe the most miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give no\r\nconsent to it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in\r\nthe mean time, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\r\nto business, and frequently expostulating with my father and mother\r\nabout their being so positively determined against what they knew my\r\ninclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went\r\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;\r\nbut, I say, being there, and one of my companions then going by sea to\r\nLondon, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the\r\ncommon allurement of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me nothing\r\nfor my passage, I consulted neither father or mother any more, not so\r\nmuch as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they\r\nmight, without asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any\r\nconsideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God\r\nknows, on the first of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound\r\nfor London. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began\r\nsooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out\r\nof the Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a\r\nmost frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was\r\nmost inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began now\r\nseriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was\r\novertaken by the judgment of Heaven for wickedly leaving my father's\r\nhouse, and abandoning my duty. All the good counsel of my parents, my\r\nfather's tears and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind;\r\nand my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to\r\nwhich it has been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and\r\nthe breach of my duty to God and my father.\r\n\r\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never been\r\nupon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many\r\ntimes since; no, nor like what I saw a few days after: but it was enough\r\nto affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known any\r\nthing of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,\r\nand that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or\r\nhollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind\r\nI made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please God here to\r\nspare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land\r\nagain, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a\r\nship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run\r\nmyself into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the\r\ngoodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how\r\neasy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been\r\nexposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I\r\nwould, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.\r\n\r\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm, and indeed\r\nsome time after; but the next day, as the wind was abated, and the sea\r\ncalmer, I began to be a little inured to it: however, I was very grave\r\nfor all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night\r\nthe weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine\r\nevening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the\r\nnext morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun\r\nshining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that\r\nI ever saw.\r\n\r\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very\r\ncheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and\r\nterrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in a\r\nlittle time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my\r\ncompanion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me and said, \"Well;\r\nBob,\" clapping me on the shoulder, \"how do you do after it? I warrant\r\nyou were frightened, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a cap-full\r\nof wind?\"--\"A cap-full do you call it?\" said I; \"it was a terrible\r\nstorm.\"--\"A storm, you fool you,\" replied he, \"do you call that a\r\nstorm? why it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room,\r\nand we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you're but a\r\nfresh-water sailor. Bob, Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll\r\nforget all that; do you see what charming weather it is now?\" To make\r\nshort this sad part of my story, we went the old way of all sailors; the\r\npunch was made, and I was made drunk with it; and in that one night's\r\nwickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past\r\nconduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In a word, as the sea was\r\nreturned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the\r\nabatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my\r\nfears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being\r\nforgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely\r\nforgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found,\r\nindeed, some intervals of reflection; and serious thoughts did, as it\r\nwere, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and\r\nroused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself\r\nto drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, for so\r\nI called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory\r\nover conscience, as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled\r\nwith it, could desire: but I was to have another trial for it still; and\r\nProvidence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me\r\nentirely without excuse: for if I would not take this for a deliverance,\r\nthe next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch\r\namong us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.\r\n\r\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\r\nhaving been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made but little way\r\nsince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to anchor, and here we\r\nlay, the wind continuing contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or\r\neight days, during which tune a great many ships from Newcastle came\r\ninto the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait\r\nfor a wind for the River.\r\n\r\nWe had not, however, rid here so long, but should have tided it up the\r\nriver, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or\r\nfive days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good as\r\na harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very strong, our\r\nmen were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but\r\nspent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the\r\neighth day in the morning the wind increased, and we had all hands at\r\nwork to strike our top-masts, and make every thing snug and close, that\r\nthe ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high\r\nindeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we\r\nthought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master\r\nordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two anchors a-head,\r\nand the cables veered out to the better end.\r\n\r\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see\r\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The\r\nmaster, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as\r\nhe went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly say to\r\nhimself several times, \"Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost;\r\nwe shall be all undone!\" and the like. During these first hurries I was\r\nstupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot\r\ndescribe my temper: I could ill reassume the first penitence which I had\r\nso apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against. I thought the\r\nbitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like\r\nthe first: but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now,\r\nand said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted: I got up but\r\nof my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw; the\r\nsea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes:\r\nwhen I could look about, I could see nothing but distress around us: two\r\nships that rid near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board,\r\nbeing deep laden; and our men cried out, that a ship which rid about a\r\nmile a-head of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven from their\r\nanchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that\r\nwith not a mast standing. The light ships-fared the best, as not so much\r\nlabouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by\r\nus, running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to\r\nlet them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do: but\r\nthe boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would\r\nfounder, he consented; and when they had cut away the-fore-mast, the\r\nmain-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged\r\nto cut her away also, and make a clear deck.\r\n\r\nAny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was\r\nbut a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a\r\nlittle. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts that I had\r\nabout me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account\r\nof my former convictions, and the having returned from them to the\r\nresolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;\r\nand these, added to the terror of the storm, put me in such a condition,\r\nthat I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the\r\nstorm continued with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged\r\nthey had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep\r\nladen, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried\r\nout, she would founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that I did\r\nnot know what they meant by _founder_, till I inquired. However, the\r\nstorm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the\r\nboatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their\r\nprayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the\r\nbottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our\r\ndistresses, one of the men that had been down on purpose to see, cried\r\nout, we had sprung a leak; another said, there was four foot water in\r\nthe hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very word my\r\nheart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side\r\nof my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and\r\ntold me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to\r\npump as another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and worked\r\nvery heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing some light\r\ncolliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and\r\nrun away to sea, and would not come near us, ordered us to fire a gun as\r\na signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, was so\r\nsurprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had\r\nhappened. In a word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As\r\nthis was a time when every body had his own life to think of, nobody\r\nminded me, or what was become of me; but another man stept up to the\r\npump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had\r\nbeen dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.\r\n\r\nWe worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that\r\nthe ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little,\r\nyet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port,\r\nso the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had\r\nrid it out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was\r\nwith the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for\r\nus to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at\r\nlast the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save\r\nours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and\r\nthen veered it out a great length, which they, after great labour and\r\nhazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got\r\nall into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were\r\nin the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so all agreed to\r\nlet her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we\r\ncould; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon\r\nshore he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly\r\ndriving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore\r\nalmost as far as Winterton Ness.\r\n\r\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we\r\nsaw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by\r\na ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to\r\nlook up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from that moment\r\nthey rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in; my\r\nheart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with\r\nhorror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the oar to\r\nbring the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mounting the\r\nwaves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along\r\nthe strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow\r\nway towards the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past\r\nthe light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward,\r\ntowards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the\r\nwind. Here we got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got all\r\nsafe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as\r\nunfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the\r\nmagistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular\r\nmerchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to\r\ncarry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.\r\n\r\nHad I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I\r\nhad been happy, and my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's\r\nparable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I\r\nwent away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while\r\nbefore he had any assurance that I was not drowned.\r\n\r\nBut my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could\r\nresist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason, and my\r\nmore composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know\r\nnot what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling\r\ndecree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,\r\neven though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes\r\nopen. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery\r\nattending, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could have\r\npushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most\r\nretired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met\r\nwith in my first attempt.\r\n\r\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the master's\r\nson, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to me after we\r\nwere at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were\r\nseparated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw\r\nme, it appeared his tone was altered, and looking very melancholy, and\r\nshaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was,\r\nand how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther\r\nabroad; his father turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone,\r\n\"Young man,\" says he, \"you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought\r\nto take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a\r\nseafaring man,\"--\"Why, Sir,\" said I, \"will you go to sea no more?\" \"That\r\nis another case,\" said he; \"it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but\r\nas you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has\r\ngiven you of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all\r\nbefallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,\"\r\ncontinues he, \"what are you; and on what account did you go to sea?\"\r\nUpon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out\r\nwith a strange kind of passion; \"What had I done,\" says he, \"that such\r\nan unhappy wretch should come into my ship? I would not set my foot in\r\nthe same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds,\" This indeed was,\r\nas I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the\r\nsense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go.\r\nHowever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go\r\nback to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might\r\nsee a visible hand of Heaven against me. \"And young man,\" said he,\r\n\"depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet\r\nwith nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your father's words\r\nare fulfilled upon you.\"\r\n\r\nWe parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no\r\nmore: which way he went, I know not. As for me, having some money in my\r\npocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the\r\nroad, had many struggles with myself, what course of life I should\r\ntake, and whether I should go home, or go to sea.\r\n\r\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best notions that offered to my\r\nthoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at\r\namong the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and\r\nmother only, but even every body else; from whence I have since often\r\nobserved, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind\r\nis, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in\r\nsuch cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed\r\nto repent; nor ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be\r\nesteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make\r\nthem be esteemed wise men.\r\n\r\nIn this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what\r\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible\r\nreluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed a while, the\r\nremembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated,\r\nthe little notion I had in my desires to a return wore off with it, till\r\nat last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for\r\na voyage.\r\n\r\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my father's house,\r\nthat hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my\r\nfortune; and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to\r\nmake me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the\r\ncommands of my father: I say, the same influence, whatever it was,\r\npresented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I\r\nwent on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors\r\nvulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.\r\n\r\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship\r\nmyself as a sailor; whereby, though I might indeed have worked a little\r\nharder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learnt the duty and\r\noffice of a foremast-man; and in time might have qualified myself for a\r\nmate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate to\r\nchoose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and\r\ngood clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit of a\r\ngentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, or learnt\r\nto do any.\r\n\r\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,\r\nwhich does not always happen to such loose and unguided young fellows as\r\nI then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them\r\nvery early: but it was not so with me. I first fell acquainted with the\r\nmaster of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having\r\nhad very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who taking a\r\nfancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that\r\ntime, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would\r\ngo the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be his\r\nmessmate and his companion; and if I could carry any thing with me, I\r\nshould have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit; and\r\nperhaps I might meet with some encouragement.\r\n\r\nI embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this\r\ncaptain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with\r\nhim, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested\r\nhonesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I\r\ncarried about £40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to\r\nbuy. This £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of my\r\nrelations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father,\r\nor at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nThis was the only voyage which I may say I was successful in all my\r\nadventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend\r\nthe captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the\r\nmathematics and the rules of navigation, learnt how to keep an account\r\nof the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand\r\nsome things that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, as he\r\ntook delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word,\r\nthis voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home\r\nfive pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me\r\nin London at my return almost £300, and this filled me with those\r\naspiring thoughts which have so completed my ruin.\r\n\r\nYet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I\r\nwas continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the\r\nexcessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the\r\ncoast, from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.\r\n\r\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great\r\nmisfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same\r\nvoyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his\r\nmate in his former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This\r\nwas the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry\r\nquite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, and which I\r\nlodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into\r\nterrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was this, viz. our\r\nship making her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between\r\nthose islands and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of the\r\nmorning by a Turkish rover, of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the\r\nsail she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as our yards would\r\nspread, or our masts carry to have got clear; but finding the pirate\r\ngained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we\r\nprepared to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rover eighteen.\r\nAbout three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by\r\nmistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he\r\nintended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured\r\nin a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning\r\nour fire, and pouring in also his small-shot from near 200 men which he\r\nhad on board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping\r\nclose. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but\r\nlaying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered\r\nsixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking\r\nthe sails and rigging. We plied them with small-shot, half-pikes,\r\npowder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice.\r\nHowever, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being\r\ndisabled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged\r\nto yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging\r\nto the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended; nor\r\nwas I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our\r\nmen were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize,\r\nand made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business. At\r\nthis surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a\r\nmiserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon\r\nmy father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and\r\nhave none to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought\r\nto pass, that I could not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had\r\novertaken me, and I was undone without redemption: but, alas! this was\r\nbut a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the\r\nsequel of this story.\r\n\r\nAs my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was in\r\nhopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again,\r\nbelieving that it would sometime or other be his fate to be taken by a\r\nSpanish or Portugal man of war; and that then I should be set at\r\nliberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to\r\nsea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the\r\ncommon drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again\r\nfrom his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nHere I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to\r\neffect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it:\r\nnothing presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had\r\nnobody to communicate it to that would embark with me, no fellow slave,\r\nno Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two\r\nyears, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never\r\nhad the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.\r\n\r\nAfter about two years an odd circumstance presented itself, which put\r\nthe old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.\r\nMy patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,\r\nwhich, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or\r\ntwice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the\r\nship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always\r\ntook me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we made him very\r\nmerry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that\r\nsometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the\r\nyouth of Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.\r\n\r\nIt happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark calm morning, a\r\nfog rose so thick, that though we were not half a league from the shore\r\nwe lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we\r\nlaboured all day, and all the next night, and when the morning came we\r\nfound we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and\r\nthat we were at least two leagues from the shore: however, we got well\r\nin again, though with a great deal of labour and some danger; for the\r\nwind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly we were\r\nall very hungry.\r\n\r\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of\r\nhimself for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our\r\nEnglish ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any\r\nmore without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter\r\nof his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little\r\nstate-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a\r\nbarge, with a place to stand behind it to steer and haul home the\r\nmain-sheet; and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the\r\nsails: she sailed with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail; and the\r\nboom gibbed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and\r\nhad in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat\r\non, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he\r\nthought fit to drink; and particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.\r\n\r\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I was most\r\ndexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened\r\nthat he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for\r\nfish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for\r\nwhom he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board\r\nthe boat over-night a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had\r\nordered me to get ready three fuzees with powder and shot, which were on\r\nboard his ship; for that they designed some sport of fowling as well\r\nas fishing.\r\n\r\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning\r\nwith the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants out, and every thing\r\nto accommodate his guests; when by and by my patron came on board alone,\r\nand told me his guests had put off going, upon some business that fell\r\nout, and ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the\r\nboat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his\r\nhouse; and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it\r\nhome to his house; all which I prepared to do.\r\n\r\nThis moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,\r\nfor now I found I was like to have a little ship at my command; and my\r\nmaster being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing\r\nbusiness, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as\r\nconsider, whither I should steer; for any where, to get out of that\r\nplace, was my way.\r\n\r\nMy first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to\r\nget something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not\r\npresume to eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was true: so he\r\nbrought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars\r\nwith fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of\r\nbottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some\r\nEnglish prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on\r\nshore, as if they had been there before for our master: I conveyed also\r\na great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a\r\nhundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and\r\na hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the\r\nwax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently\r\ncame into also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley; so\r\nI called him: \"Moley,\" said I, \"our patron's guns are on board the boat;\r\ncan you not get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill some\r\nalcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps\r\nthe gunner's stores in the ship.\"--\"Yes,\" says he, \"I'll bring some;\"\r\nand accordingly he brought a great leather pouch which held about a\r\npound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that\r\nhad five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat: at\r\nthe same time I had found some powder of my master's in the great cabin,\r\nwith which I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was\r\nalmost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus furnished\r\nwith every thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle,\r\nwhich is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no\r\nnotice of us: and we were not above a mile out of the port before we\r\nhauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew from the\r\nN.N.E. which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I\r\nhad been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to\r\nthe bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I\r\nwould be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest\r\nto fate.\r\n\r\nAfter we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when I had fish\r\non my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said\r\nto the Moor, \"This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we\r\nmust stand farther off.\" He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the\r\nhead of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out\r\nnear a league farther, and then brought her to as if I would fish; when\r\ngiving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and\r\nmaking as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise\r\nwith my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the\r\nsea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,\r\nbegged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world with me.\r\nHe swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached me very\r\nquickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into the\r\ncabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him,\r\nand told him, I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would\r\ndo him none: \"But,\" said I, \"you swim well enough to reach to the shore,\r\nand the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do\r\nyou no harm; but if you come near the boat I'll shoot you through the\r\nhead, for I am resolved to have my liberty.\" so he turned himself about,\r\nand swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease,\r\nfor he was an excellent swimmer.\r\n\r\nI could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have\r\ndrowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was\r\ngone I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him,\r\n\"Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a great man; but if\r\nyou will not stroke your face to be true to me,\" that is, swear by\r\nMahomet and his father's beard, \"I must throw you into the sea too.\" The\r\nboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not\r\nmistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the\r\nworld with me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly\r\nto sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might\r\nthink me gone towards the Straits' mouth; (as indeed any one that had\r\nbeen in their wits must have been supposed to do) for who would have\r\nsupposed we were sailed on to the southward to the truly Barbarian\r\ncoast, where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with the\r\ncanoes, and destroy us; where we could never once go on shore but we\r\nshould be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of\r\nhuman kind?\r\n\r\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and\r\nsteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward\r\nthe east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh\r\ngale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe\r\nby the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the\r\nland, I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond\r\nthe Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king\r\nthereabout, for we saw no people.\r\n\r\nYet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful\r\napprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,\r\nor go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I\r\nhad sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the\r\nsouthward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of\r\nme, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,\r\nand come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what,\r\nor where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what\r\nriver: I neither saw, or desired to see any people; the principal thing\r\nI wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,\r\nresolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the\r\ncountry; but, as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful\r\nnoises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we\r\nknew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and\r\nbegged of me not to go on shore till day. \"Well, Xury,\" said I, \"then I\r\nwon't; but it may be we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as\r\nthose lions.\"--\"Then we give them the shoot gun,\" says Xury, laughing,\r\n\"make them run wey.\" Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us\r\nslaves. However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a\r\ndram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all,\r\nXury's advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little anchor, and\r\nlay still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in two or three\r\nhours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call them) of\r\nmany sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing\r\nand washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they\r\nmade such hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nXury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too; but we were\r\nboth more frightened when we heard one of these mighty creatures come\r\nswimming towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him\r\nby his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast; Xury said it\r\nwas a lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to\r\nme to weigh the anchor and row away: \"No,\" says I, \"Xury; we can slip\r\nour cable with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us\r\nfar.\" I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it\r\nwas) within two oars' length, which something surprised me; however, I\r\nimmediately stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at\r\nhim; upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards the\r\nshore again.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous cries\r\nand howlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as\r\nhigher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing\r\nI have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before:\r\nthis convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night\r\nupon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another\r\nquestion too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages,\r\nhad been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers; at\r\nleast we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.\r\n\r\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other\r\nfor water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when or where to get\r\nit, was the point: Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one\r\nof the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some to me.\r\nI asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the\r\nboat? The boy answered with so much affection, that made me love him\r\never after. Says he, \"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go\r\nwey.\"--\"Well, Xury,\" said I, \"we will both go, and if the wild mans\r\ncome, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us.\" So I gave Xury a\r\npiece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of\r\nbottles which I mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the\r\nshore as we thought was proper, and so waded to shore; carrying nothing\r\nbut our arms, and two jars for water.\r\n\r\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of\r\ncanoes with savages down the river: but the boy seeing a low place about\r\na mile up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him come\r\nrunning towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted\r\nwith some wild beast, and I run forward towards him to help him, but\r\nwhen I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders,\r\nwhich was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in\r\ncolour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was\r\nvery good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell\r\nme he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.\r\n\r\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for\r\na little higher up the creek where we were, we found the water fresh\r\nwhen the tide was out, which flows but a little way up; so we filled\r\nour jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on\r\nour way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAs I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that the\r\nislands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far\r\noff from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an observation\r\nto know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least\r\nremembering what latitude they were in, and knew not where to look for\r\nthem, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now\r\neasily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that if I\r\nstood along this coast till I came to that part where the English\r\ntraded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of\r\ntrade, that would relieve and take us in.\r\n\r\nBy the best of my calculation, that place where I now was, must be that\r\ncountry, which, lying between the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the\r\nNegroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes\r\nhaving abandoned it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors; and\r\nthe Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness;\r\nand indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious numbers of\r\ntigers, lions, and leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour\r\nthere; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go\r\nlike an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near\r\nan hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste,\r\nuninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring\r\nof wild beasts by night.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,\r\nbeing the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a\r\ngreat mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having\r\ntried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going\r\ntoo high for my little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design,\r\nand keep along the shore.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left\r\nthis place; and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came\r\nto an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high; and the\r\ntide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes\r\nwere more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and\r\ntells me that we had best go farther off the shore; \"for,\" says he,\r\n\"look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast\r\nasleep.\" I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,\r\nfor it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore,\r\nunder the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little\r\nover him. \"Xury,\" says I, \"you shall go on shore and kill him.\" Xury\r\nlooked frightened, and said, \"Me kill! he eat me at one mouth;\" one\r\nmouthful he meant: however, I said no more to the boy, but bad him lie\r\nstill, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and\r\nloaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it\r\ndown; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we\r\nhad three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best\r\naim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he\r\nlay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit\r\nhis leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up, growling at\r\nfirst, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then got up upon\r\nthree legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a\r\nlittle surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up\r\nthe second piece immediately, and, though he began to move off, fired\r\nagain, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop,\r\nand make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took\r\nheart, and would have me let him go on shore; \"Well, go,\" said I; so the\r\nboy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to\r\nshore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the\r\nmuzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which\r\ndispatched him quite.\r\n\r\nThis was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry\r\nto lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good\r\nfor nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he\r\ncomes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. \"For what, Xury?\"\r\nsaid I, \"Me cut off his head,\" said he. However, Xury could not cut off\r\nhis head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a\r\nmonstrous great one.\r\n\r\nI bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin of him might one way\r\nor other be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin if\r\nI could. So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the\r\nbetter workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took\r\nus both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and\r\nspreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in\r\ntwo days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.\r\n\r\nAfter this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or\r\ntwelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which began to abate\r\nvery much, and going no oftener into the shore than we were obliged to\r\nfor fresh water: my design in this was, to make the river Gambia or\r\nSenegal, that is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was\r\nin hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not\r\nwhat course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there\r\namong the Negroes, I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed\r\neither to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made\r\nthis Cape, or those islands; and in a word, I put the whole of my\r\nfortune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship,\r\nor must perish.\r\n\r\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have\r\nsaid, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three\r\nplaces, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at\r\nus; we could also perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I was\r\nonce inclined to have gone off shore to them; but Xury was my better\r\ncounsellor, and said to me, \"No go, no go.\" However, I hauled in nearer\r\nthe shore that I might talk to them, and I found they run along the\r\nshore by me a good way: I observed they had no weapons in their hands,\r\nexcept one, who had a long slender stick, which Nury said was a lance,\r\nand that they would throw them a great way with a good aim; so I kept\r\nat a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could; and\r\nparticularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to\r\nstop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the\r\ntop of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and\r\nin less than half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of\r\ndry flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their country; but we\r\nneither knew what the one or the other was: however, we were willing to\r\naccept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for\r\nventuring on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us: but they\r\ntook a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it\r\ndown, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board,\r\nand then came close to us again.\r\n\r\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends;\r\nbut an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;\r\nfor while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures, one\r\npursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains\r\ntowards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or whether\r\nthey were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could\r\ntell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;\r\nbecause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but\r\nin the night; and in the second place, we found the people terribly\r\nfrightened, especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart did\r\nnot fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran\r\ndirectly into the water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of\r\nthe Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if\r\nthey had come for their diversion: at last, one of them began to come\r\nnearer our boat than I at first expected; but I lay ready for him, for I\r\nhad loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both\r\nthe others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot\r\nhim directly in the head: immediately he sunk down into the water, but\r\nrose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for\r\nlife, and so indeed he was: he immediately made to the shore; but\r\nbetween the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the\r\nwater, he died just before he reached the shore.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures, at\r\nthe noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die for\r\nfear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the\r\ncreature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to\r\ncome to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began to\r\nsearch for the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water;\r\nand by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the Negroes\r\nto haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious\r\nleopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the Negroes held\r\nup their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed\r\nhim with.\r\n\r\nThe other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the noise of\r\nthe gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from\r\nwhence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I\r\nfound quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so\r\nI was willing to have them take it as a favour from me; which, when I\r\nmade signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful\r\nfor. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had no\r\nknife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as\r\nreadily, and much more readily, than we could have done with a knife.\r\nThey offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I\r\nwould give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very\r\nfreely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions, which,\r\nthough I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them\r\nfor some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom\r\nupward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled.\r\nThey called immediately to some of their friends, and there came two\r\nwomen, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I\r\nsuppose, in the sun; this they set down to me, as before, and I sent\r\nXury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were as\r\nstark naked as the men.\r\n\r\nI was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and\r\nleaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,\r\nwithout offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a\r\ngreat length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues\r\nbefore me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing, to make\r\nthis point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from\r\nthe land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward: then I\r\nconcluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de\r\nVerd, and those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands.\r\nHowever, they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I\r\nhad best to do; for if I should be taken with a gale of wind, I might\r\nneither reach one nor the other.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and\r\nsat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,\r\nMaster, master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was frightened\r\nout of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships\r\nsent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their\r\nreach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the\r\nship, but what she was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I\r\nthought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But, when I\r\nobserved the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound\r\nsome other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore: upon\r\nwhich, I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak\r\nwith them, if possible.\r\n\r\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in\r\ntheir way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal\r\nto them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair,\r\nthey, it seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses, and\r\nthat it was some European boat, which, they supposed, must belong to\r\nsome ship that was lost; so they shortened sail, to let me come up. I\r\nwas encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign on board, I\r\nmade a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun,\r\nboth which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they\r\ndid not hear the gun. Upon these signals, they very kindly brought to,\r\nand lay by for me; and in about three hours' time I came up with them.\r\n\r\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,\r\nbut I understood none of them; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on\r\nboard, called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an\r\nEnglishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at\r\nSallee: they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and\r\nall my goods.\r\n\r\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I\r\nwas thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable, and almost\r\nhopeless, condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to\r\nthe captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he\r\ngenerously told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I had\r\nshould be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. \"For,\" says\r\nhe, \"I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be\r\nsaved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in\r\nthe same condition. Besides,\" continued he, \"when I carry you to the\r\nBrazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from you\r\nwhat you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away that\r\nlife I have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese,\" (Mr. Englishman,) says he;\r\n\"I will carry you thither in charity, and these things will help to buy\r\nyour subsistence there, and your passage home again.\"\r\n\r\nAs he was charitable, in this proposal, so he was just in the\r\nperformance, to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that none should\r\noffer to touch any thing I had: then he took every thing into his own\r\npossession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might\r\nhave them, even so much as my three earthen jars.\r\n\r\nAs to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he\r\nwould buy it of me for the ship's use; and asked me what I would have\r\nfor it? I told him, he had been so generous to me in every thing, that I\r\ncould not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to\r\nhim: upon which, he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me\r\neighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any\r\none offered to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty\r\npieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that\r\nI was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to\r\nsell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in\r\nprocuring my own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to\r\nbe just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an\r\nobligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon\r\nthis, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the\r\ncaptain have him.\r\n\r\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de\r\nTodos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after.\r\nAnd now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all\r\nconditions of life; and what to do next with myself, I was now\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remember:\r\nhe would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for\r\nthe leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my\r\nboat, and caused every thing I had in the ship to be punctually\r\ndelivered to me; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me; such\r\nas the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of\r\nbees-wax,--for I had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about\r\ntwo hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this\r\nstock, I went on shore in the Brazils.\r\n\r\nI had not been long here, before I was recommended to the house of a\r\ngood honest man, like himself, who had an ingeino as they call it, (that\r\nis, a plantation and a sugar-house.) I lived with him some time, and\r\nacquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of planting and making\r\nof sugar: and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich\r\nsuddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would\r\nturn planter among them: endeavouring, in the mean time, to find out\r\nsome way to get my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To\r\nthis purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I purchased\r\nas much land that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan\r\nfor my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the\r\nstock which I proposed to myself to receive from England.\r\n\r\nI had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but: born of English parents,\r\nwhose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. I call\r\nhim my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went\r\non very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we\r\nrather planted for food than any thing else, for about two years.\r\nHowever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so\r\nthat Ihe third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large\r\npiece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come: but we\r\nboth wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in\r\nparting with my boy Xury.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great\r\nwonder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had got into an employment\r\nquite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted\r\nin, and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke through all his\r\ngood advice: nay, I was coining into the very middle station, or upper\r\ndegree of low life, which my father advised me to before; and which, if\r\nI resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and never\r\nhave fatigued myself in the world, as I had done: and I used often to\r\nsay to myself, I could have done this as well in England, among my\r\nfriends, as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers\r\nand savages, in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear\r\nfrom any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.\r\nI had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work\r\nto be done, but by the labour of my hands: and I used to say, I lived\r\njust like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody\r\nthere but himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men\r\nreflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others\r\nthat are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be\r\nconvinced of their former felicity by their experience: I say, how just\r\nhas it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island\r\nof mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared\r\nit with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in\r\nall probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.\r\n\r\nI was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the\r\nplantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me\r\nup at sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in providing his\r\nlading, and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when, telling\r\nhim what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this\r\nfriendly and sincere advice: \"Seignior Inglese,\" says he, for so he\r\nalways called me, \"if you will give me letters, and a procuration here\r\nin form to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London,\r\nto send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and\r\nin such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the\r\nproduce of them, God willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are\r\nall subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders for\r\nbut one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and\r\nlet the hazard be run for the first, so that if it come safe, you may\r\norder the rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, you may have the other\r\nhalf to have recourse to for your supply.\"\r\n\r\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not\r\nbut be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly\r\nprepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I left my money, and a\r\nprocuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired me.\r\n\r\nI wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my adventures;\r\nmy slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese captain at\r\nsea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now in,\r\nwith all other necessary directions for my supply; and when this honest\r\ncaptain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants\r\nthere, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of my story\r\nto a merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her:\r\nwhereupon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket,\r\nsent the Portuguese captain a very handsome present for his humanity and\r\ncharity to me.\r\n\r\nThe merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,\r\nsuch as the captain had wrote for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,\r\nand he brought them all safe to me at the Brazils: among which, without\r\nmy direction, (for I was too young in my business to think of them,) he\r\nhad taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils,\r\nnecessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.\r\n\r\nWhen this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised\r\nwith the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out the\r\nfive pounds, which my friend had sent him as a present for himself, to\r\npurchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years' service,\r\nand would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco,\r\nwhich I would have him accept, being of my own produce.\r\n\r\nNeither was this all: but my goods being all English manufactures, such\r\nas cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable\r\nin the country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so\r\nthat I might say, I had more than four times the value of my first\r\ncargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the\r\nadvancement of my plantation: for the first thing I did, I bought me a\r\nNegro slave, and ail European servant also; I mean another besides that\r\nwhich the captain brought me from Lisbon.\r\n\r\nBut as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our\r\nadversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great success\r\nin my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own\r\nground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours;\r\nand these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundred weight, were well\r\ncured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon: and now,\r\nincreasing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of\r\nprojects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, often\r\nthe ruin of the best heads in business. Had I continued in the station\r\nI was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen\r\nme, for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life,\r\nand which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be\r\nfull of: but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful\r\nagent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase my fault,\r\nand double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I\r\nshould have leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my\r\napparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination, of wandering\r\nabout, and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest\r\nviews of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those\r\nprospects, and those measures of life, which nature and Providence\r\nconcurred to present me with, and to make my duty.\r\n\r\nAs I had once done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I could not\r\nbe content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being a\r\nrich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and\r\nimmoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing\r\nadmitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulph of\r\nhuman misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent\r\nwith life, and a state of health in the world.\r\n\r\nTo come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this part of my\r\nstory:--You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the\r\nBrazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my\r\nplantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted an\r\nacquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among\r\nthe merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my\r\ndiscourses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two\r\nvoyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes\r\nthere, and how easy it was to purchase on the coast for trifles--such\r\nas beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass, and the\r\nlike--not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c. but\r\nNegroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,\r\nbut especially to that part which related to the buying Negroes; which\r\nwas a trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as far as\r\nit was, had been carried on by the assientos, or permission of the kings\r\nof Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so that few\r\nNegroes were bought, and those excessive dear.\r\n\r\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my\r\nacquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them\r\ncame to me the next morning, and told me they had been musing very much\r\nupon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to\r\nmake a secret proposal to me: and, after enjoining me to secrecy, they\r\ntold me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that\r\nthey had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing\r\nso much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried\r\non, because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came\r\nhome, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on\r\nshore privately, and divide them among their own plantations: and, in a\r\nword, the question was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship,\r\nto manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me\r\nthat I should have an equal share of the Negroes, without providing any\r\npart of the stock.\r\n\r\nThis was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any\r\none that had not a settlement and plantation of his own to look after,\r\nwhich was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a\r\ngood stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and established,\r\nand had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years\r\nmore, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and\r\nwho, in that time, and with that little addition, could scarce have\r\nfailed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that\r\nincreasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the most\r\npreposterous thing that ever man, in such circumstances, could be\r\nguilty of.\r\n\r\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the\r\noffer, than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my father's\r\ngood counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with\r\nall my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my\r\nabsence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I\r\nmiscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or\r\ncovenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation\r\nand effects, in case of my death; making the captain of the ship that\r\nhad saved my life, as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to\r\ndispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the\r\nproduce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.\r\n\r\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to\r\nkeep up my plantation: had I used half as much prudence to have looked\r\ninto my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have\r\ndone and not to have done I had certainly never gone away from so\r\nprosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving\r\ncircumstance, and gone a voyage to sea, attended with all its common\r\nhazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular\r\nmisfortunes to myself.\r\n\r\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy,\r\nrather than my reason: and accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and\r\nthe cargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement, by my partners\r\nin the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the 1st of\r\nSeptember, 1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my\r\nfather and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority,\r\nand the fool to my own interest.\r\n\r\nOur ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns,\r\nand fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself; we had on\r\nboard no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our\r\ntrade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd\r\ntrifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissars, hatchets,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the northward\r\nupon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast.\r\nWhen they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which,\r\nit seems, was the manner of their course in those days, we had very good\r\nweather, only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast, till we came\r\nto the height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping farther off at\r\nsea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle\r\nFernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N. and leaving those\r\nisles on the east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve\r\ndays' time, and were by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 minutes\r\nnorthern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite\r\nout of our knowledge: it began from the south-east, came about to the\r\nnorth-west, and then settled in the north-east; from whence it blew in\r\nsuch a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do\r\nnothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither\r\never fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during these twelve\r\ndays, I need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor,\r\nindeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.\r\n\r\nIn this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our\r\nmen died of the calenture, and one man and a boy washed overboard. About\r\nthe twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an\r\nobservation as well as he could, and found that he was in about 11\r\ndegrees north latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude\r\ndifference, west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was got\r\nupon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river\r\nAmazons, toward that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great\r\nRiver; and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the\r\nship was leaky and very much disabled, add he was going directly back to\r\nthe coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\nI was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the\r\nsea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited\r\ncountry for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle of\r\nthe Caribbee islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for\r\nBarbadoes; which by keeping off to sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay\r\nor gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about\r\nfifteen days' sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the\r\ncoast of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and ourselves.\r\n\r\nWith this design, we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W. in\r\norder to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief:\r\nbut our voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the latitude of 12\r\ndegrees 18 minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us away\r\nwith the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way\r\nof all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the sea,\r\nwe were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever\r\nreturning to our own country.\r\n\r\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early\r\nin the morning cried out, Land! and we had no sooner run out of the\r\ncabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,\r\nbut the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so\r\nstopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we\r\nshould all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven\r\ninto our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like condition, to\r\ndescribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances; we\r\nknew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven,\r\nwhether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and\r\nas the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at\r\nfirst, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes,\r\nwithout breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind of miracle,\r\nshould immediately turn about. In a word, we sat looking upon one\r\nanother, and expecting death every moment, and every man acting\r\naccordingly, as preparing for another world; for there was little or\r\nnothing more for us to do in this: that which was our present comfort,\r\nand all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our expectation, the\r\nship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began\r\nto abate.\r\n\r\nNow, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship\r\nhaving thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect\r\nher getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing\r\nto do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a\r\nboat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by\r\ndashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke\r\naway, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope\r\nfrom her: we had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the\r\nsea was a doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for we\r\nfancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us\r\nshe was actually broken already.\r\n\r\nIn this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with\r\nthe help of the rest of the men, they got her flung over the ship's\r\nside; and getting all into her, let her go, and committed ourselves,\r\nbeing eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea: for though the\r\nstorm was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the\r\nshore, and might be well called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the\r\nsea in a storm.\r\n\r\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly, that\r\nthe sea went so high, that the boat could not live, and that we should\r\nbe inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, if we had,\r\ncould we have done any thing with it; so we worked at the oar towards\r\nthe land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we\r\nall knew that when the boat came nearer to the shore, she would be\r\ndashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we\r\ncommitted our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind\r\ndriving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own\r\nhands, pulling as well as we could towards land.\r\n\r\nWhat the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal--we\r\nknew not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow\r\nof expectation, was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the\r\nmouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat\r\nin, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But\r\nthere was nothing of this appeared; and as we made nearer and nearer the\r\nshore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we\r\nreckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us,\r\nand plainly bade us expect the _coup de grace_. In a word, it took us\r\nwith such a fury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us,\r\nas well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to\r\nsay, \"O God!\" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.\r\n\r\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sunk\r\ninto the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver\r\nmyself from the waves so as to draw my breath, till that wave having\r\ndriven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and\r\nhaving spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry,\r\nbut half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind,\r\nas well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I\r\nexpected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the\r\nland as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me\r\nup again; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the\r\nsea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy,\r\nwhich I had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to\r\nhold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, by\r\nswimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,\r\nif possible; my greatest concern now being, that the wave, as it would\r\ncarry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry\r\nme back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe wave that came upon me again, buried me at once twenty or thirty\r\nfeet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself carried with a mighty\r\nforce and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I held my\r\nbreath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might. I\r\nwas ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising\r\nup, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out\r\nabove the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of\r\ntime that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me\r\nbreath, and new courage. I was covered again with water a good while,\r\nbut not so long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent\r\nitself, and began to return, I struck forward against the return of the\r\nwaves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments,\r\nto recover breath, and till the water went from me, and then took to my\r\nheels, and ran with what strength I had farther towards the shore. But\r\nneither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came\r\npouring in after me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves\r\nand carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.\r\n\r\nThe last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me; for the sea\r\nhaving hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,\r\nagainst a piece of a rock, and that with such force, that it left me\r\nsenseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow\r\ntaking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my\r\nbody; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled\r\nin the water: but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,\r\nand seeing I should again be covered with the water, I resolved to hold\r\nfast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till\r\nthe wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as the first,\r\nbeing nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched\r\nanother run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,\r\nthough it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me\r\naway; and the next run I took, I got to the main land; where, to my\r\ngreat comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down\r\nupon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nI was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God\r\nthat my life was saved, in a case wherein there were, some minutes\r\nbefore, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express,\r\nto the life, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it\r\nis so saved, as I may say, out of the grave: and I did not wonder now at\r\nthe custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his\r\nneck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve\r\nbrought to him; I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with\r\nit, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the\r\nsurprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and\r\noverwhelm him.\r\n\r\n     For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.\r\n\r\nI walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as\r\nI may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance; making a\r\nthousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon\r\nmy comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul\r\nsaved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any\r\nsign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that\r\nwere not fellows.\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach and froth of the\r\nsea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so far off--and\r\nconsidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?\r\n\r\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I\r\nbegan to look round me, to see what kind of a place I was in, and what\r\nwas next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a\r\nword, I had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to\r\nshift me, nor any thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither\r\ndid I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with hunger, or\r\nbeing devoured by wild beasts: and that which was particularly\r\nafflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any\r\ncreature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other\r\ncreature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had\r\nnothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a\r\nbox. This was all my provision; and this threw me into such terrible\r\nagonies of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night\r\ncoming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be\r\nmy lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at\r\nnight they always come abroad for their prey.\r\n\r\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts; at that time, was, to get up\r\ninto a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny--which grew near me, and\r\nwhere I resolved to sit all night--and consider the next day what death\r\nI should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a\r\nfurlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,\r\nwhich I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little\r\ntobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting\r\nup into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that if I should fall\r\nasleep, I might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a\r\ntruncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and having been\r\nexcessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I\r\nbelieve, few could have done in my condition; and found myself the most\r\nrefreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,\r\nso that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which\r\nsurprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from\r\nthe sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up\r\nalmost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been\r\nso bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a\r\nmile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright\r\nstill, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some\r\nnecessary things for my use.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again,\r\nand the first thing I found was the boat; which lay, as the wind and the\r\nsea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand.\r\nI walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found\r\na neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about half\r\na mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon\r\ngetting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nA little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so\r\nfar out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship: and\r\nhere I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if\r\nwe had kept on board, we had been all safe; that is to say, we had all\r\ngot safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left\r\nentirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced\r\ntears from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I\r\nresolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes,\r\nfor the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water; but when I\r\ncame to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on\r\nboard; for as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was\r\nnothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the\r\nsecond time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not\r\nsee at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great\r\ndifficulty, I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got into the\r\nforecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a\r\ngreat deal of water in her hold; but that she lay so on the side of a\r\nbank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon\r\nthe bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means all her\r\nquarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be\r\nsure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what\r\nwas free: and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry\r\nand untouched by the water; and, being very well disposed to eat, I went\r\nto the bread-room, and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I\r\nwent about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some\r\nrum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had\r\nindeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted\r\nnothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw\r\nwould be very necessary to me.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and\r\nthis extremity roused my application: we had several spare yards, and\r\ntwo or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the\r\nship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as many overboard\r\nas I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that\r\nthey might not drive away. When this was done, I went down the ship's\r\nside, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both\r\nends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three\r\nshort pieces of plank upon them, crossways, I found I could walk upon it\r\nvery well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces\r\nbeing too light: so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a\r\nspare top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a\r\ngreat deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with\r\nnecessaries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to\r\nhave done upon another occasion.\r\n\r\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next\r\ncare was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it\r\nfrom the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this. I first\r\nlaid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having\r\nconsidered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests,\r\nwhich I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft;\r\nthese I filled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,\r\nfive pieces of dried goats' flesh, (which we lived much upon,) and a\r\nlittle remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls\r\nwhich we had brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There\r\nhad been some barley and wheat together, but, to my great\r\ndisappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it\r\nall. As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our\r\nskipper, in which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or\r\nsix gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being no need\r\nto put them into the chests, nor any room for them. While I was doing\r\nthis, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the\r\nmortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on\r\nshore, upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were only\r\nlinen, and open-knee'd, I swam on board in them, and my stockings.\r\nHowever, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found\r\nenough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other\r\nthings which my eye was more upon; as, first, tools to work with on\r\nshore and it was after long searching that I found the carpenter's\r\nchest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more\r\nvaluable than a ship-lading of gold would have been at that time. I got\r\nit down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look\r\ninto it, for I knew in general what it contained.\r\n\r\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very good\r\nfowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured\r\nfirst, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty\r\nswords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew\r\nnot where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them,\r\ntwo of them dry and good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to\r\nmy raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted,\r\nand began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither\r\nsail, oar, nor rudder; and the least cap-full of wind would have overset\r\nall my navigation.\r\n\r\nI had three encouragements: 1st, A smooth, calm sea: 2dly, The tide\r\nrising, and setting in to the shore: 3dly, What little wind there was,\r\nblew me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken\r\noars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the\r\nchest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this cargo I put\r\nto sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I\r\nfound it drive a little distant from the place where I had landed\r\nbefore; by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water,\r\nand consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I\r\nmight make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.\r\n\r\nAs I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little opening of\r\nthe land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I\r\nguided my raft, as well as I could, to get into the middle of the\r\nstream. But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which,\r\nif I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for knowing nothing\r\nof the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not\r\nbeing aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo\r\nhad slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the\r\nwater. I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep\r\nthem in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my\r\nstrength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but holding up\r\nthe chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an hour,\r\nin which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a\r\nlevel; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated\r\nagain, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and\r\nthen driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a\r\nlittle river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide\r\nrunning up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore,\r\nfor I was not willing to be driven too high up the river; hoping, in\r\ntime, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as\r\nnear the coast as I could.\r\n\r\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to\r\nwhich, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got\r\nso near, as that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her\r\ndirectly in; but here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the\r\nsea again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping,\r\nthere was no place to land, but where one end of my float, if it ran on\r\nshore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it\r\nwould endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait till the\r\ntide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to\r\nhold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,\r\nwhich I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I\r\nfound water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her\r\nupon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by\r\nsticking my two broken oars into the ground; one on one-side, near one\r\nend, and one on the other side, near the other end: and thus I lay till\r\nthe water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.\r\n\r\nMy next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my\r\nhabitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever\r\nmight happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent, or\r\non an island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger of\r\nwild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which\r\nrose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other\r\nhills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one of the\r\nfowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus\r\narmed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill; where,\r\nafter I had, with great labour and difficulty, got up to the top, I saw\r\nmy fate, to my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island, environed\r\nevery way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks, which lay\r\na great way off, and two small islands, less than this, which lay about\r\nthree leagues to the west.\r\n\r\nI found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good\r\nreason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom, however,\r\nI saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds;\r\nneither, when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, and\r\nwhat not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting\r\nupon a tree, on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun\r\nthat had been fired there since the creation of the world: I had no\r\nsooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there arose an\r\ninnumerable number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming,\r\nand crying, every one according to his usual note; but not one of them\r\nof any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a\r\nkind of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons or\r\nclaws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.\r\n\r\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work\r\nto bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day: what\r\nto do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest: for I\r\nwas afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast\r\nmight devour me; though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need\r\nfor those fears.\r\n\r\nHowever, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round with the chests\r\nand boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for\r\nthat night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply\r\nmyself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run\r\nout of the wood where I shot the fowl.\r\n\r\nI now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many things out of\r\nthe ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the\r\nrigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I\r\nresolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And as\r\nI knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in\r\npieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till I got every thing\r\nout of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to\r\nsay, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but this\r\nappeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was\r\ndown; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hut;\r\nhaving nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a\r\npair of pumps on my feet.\r\n\r\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and\r\nhaving had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor\r\nloaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to\r\nme: as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags of\r\nnails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets; and,\r\nabove all, that most useful thing called a grind-stone. All these I\r\nsecured together, with several things belonging to the gunner;\r\nparticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets,\r\nseven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of\r\npowder more; a large bag-full of small shot, and a great roll of\r\nsheet-lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get\r\nit over the ship's side.\r\n\r\nBesides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find,\r\nand a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I\r\nloaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very\r\ngreat comfort.\r\n\r\nI was under some apprehensions, during my absence from the land, that at\r\nleast my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back, I\r\nfound no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat,\r\nupon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little\r\ndistance, and then stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned,\r\nand looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with\r\nme. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not understand it, she\r\nwas perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon\r\nwhich I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very\r\nfree of it, for my store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I\r\nsay, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked (as\r\npleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more: so she\r\nmarched off.\r\n\r\nHaving got my second cargo on shore--though I was fain to open the\r\nbarrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,\r\nbeing large casks--I went to work to make me a little tent, with the\r\nsail, and some poles, which I cut for that purpose; and into this tent I\r\nbrought every thing that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and\r\nI piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to\r\nfortify it from any sudden attempt either from man or beast.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards\r\nwithin, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading one of\r\nthe beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my\r\ngun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very\r\nquietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before\r\nI had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch\r\nall those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.\r\n\r\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\r\nbelieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still: for while the ship\r\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out of\r\nher that I could: so every day, at low water, I went on board, and\r\nbrought away something or other; but particularly the third time I went,\r\nI brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small\r\nropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which\r\nwas to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.\r\nIn a word, I brought away all the sails first and last; only that I was\r\nfain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for\r\nthey were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvass only.\r\n\r\nBut that which comforted me still more, was, that, last of all, after I\r\nhad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\r\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I say,\r\nafter all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large\r\nrunlets of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine\r\nflour; this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any\r\nmore provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied\r\nthe hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in\r\npieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this\r\nsafe on shore also.\r\n\r\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now having plundered the ship of\r\nwhat was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables, and\r\ncutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two\r\ncables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and\r\nhaving cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing\r\nI could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods;\r\nand came away; but my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was\r\nso unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was entered the little cove,\r\nwhere I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so\r\nhandily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo\r\ninto the water; as for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the\r\nshore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially\r\nthe iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me: however,\r\nwhen the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and\r\nsome of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for\r\nit into the water, a work which fatigued me very much. After this I went\r\nevery day on board, and brought away what I could get.\r\n\r\nI had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven times on board\r\nthe ship; in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands\r\ncould well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had\r\nthe calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece\r\nby piece; but preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the\r\nwind began to rise: however, at low water, I went on board; and though I\r\nthought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing could\r\nbe found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which\r\nI found two or three razors, and one pair of large scissars with some\r\nten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another I found about\r\nthirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin, some Brazil, some\r\npieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.\r\n\r\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money: \"O drug!\" said I aloud,\r\n\"what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking\r\noff the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap: I have no\r\nmanner of use for thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the\r\nbottom, as a creature whose life is not worth saving.\" However, upon\r\nsecond thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of\r\ncanvass, I began to think of making another raft; but while I was\r\npreparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the wind began to rise,\r\nand in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It\r\npresently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft\r\nwith the wind off shore; and that it was my business to be gone before\r\nthe tide of flood began, or otherwise I might not be able to reach the\r\nshore at all. Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam\r\nacross the channel which lay between the ship and the sands, and even\r\nthat with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had\r\nabout me, and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very\r\nhastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.\r\n\r\nBut I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth\r\nabout me very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the\r\nmorning, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I was a\r\nlittle surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory\r\nreflection, viz. that I had lost no time, nor abated no diligence, to\r\nget every thing out of her that could be useful to me, and that, indeed,\r\nthere was little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had\r\nmore time.\r\n\r\nI now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any thing out of\r\nher, except what might drive on shore, from her wreck; as, indeed,\r\ndivers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small\r\nuse to me.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against\r\neither savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the\r\nisland; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what\r\nkind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth,\r\nor a tent upon the earth: and in short, I resolved upon both; the manner\r\nand description of which, it may not be improper to give an account of.\r\n\r\nI soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly\r\nbecause it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed\r\nit would not be wholesome; and more particularly because there was no\r\nfresh water near it: so I resolved to find a more healthy and more\r\nconvenient spot of ground.\r\n\r\nI consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be\r\nproper for me: 1st, Health and fresh water, I just now mentioned: 2dly,\r\nShelter from the heat of the sun: 3dly, Security from ravenous\r\ncreatures, whether men or beasts: 4thly, A view to the sea, that if God\r\nsent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my\r\ndeliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my\r\nexpectation yet.\r\n\r\nIn search for a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the\r\nside of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep\r\nas a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.\r\nOn the side of this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in,\r\nlike the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really any cave,\r\nor way into the rock, at all.\r\n\r\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\r\npitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and about\r\ntwice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the end of\r\nit, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea\r\nside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered\r\nfrom the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or\r\nthereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.\r\n\r\nBefore I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,\r\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\r\ntwenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.\r\n\r\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them\r\ninto the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end\r\nbeing out of the ground about five feet and a half and sharpened on the\r\ntop. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\r\n\r\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the ship, and laid them\r\nin rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows of\r\nstakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning\r\nagainst them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and\r\nthis fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it\r\nor over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to\r\ncut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but by a short\r\nladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over\r\nafter me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought,\r\nfrom all the world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which\r\notherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards,\r\nthere was no need of all this caution from the enemies that I\r\napprehended danger from.\r\n\r\nInto this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my\r\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the\r\naccount above; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me from the\r\nrains, that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made\r\ndouble, viz. one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it, and\r\ncovered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among\r\nthe sails.\r\n\r\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on\r\nshore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged\r\nto the mate of the ship.\r\n\r\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing that would\r\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\r\nentrance which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as\r\nI said, by a short ladder.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing\r\nall the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, I laid\r\nthem up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised\r\nthe ground within about a foot and an half; and thus I made me a cave,\r\njust behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It cost\r\nme much labour and many days, before all these things were brought to\r\nperfection; and therefore I must go back to some other things which took\r\nup some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had laid\r\nmy scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm\r\nof rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning\r\nhappened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the\r\neffect of it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning, as I was\r\nwith a thought, which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning\r\nitself: O my powder! My very heart sunk within me when I thought, that\r\nat one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on which, not my defence\r\nonly, but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was\r\nnothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder took\r\nfire, I had never known who had hurt me.\r\n\r\nSuch impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over, I\r\nlaid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself\r\nto make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little\r\nand a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not\r\nall take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be\r\npossible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in about a\r\nfortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about 240 lb. weight,\r\nwas divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that\r\nhad been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that; so I placed it\r\nin my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I\r\nhid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to\r\nit, marking very carefully where I laid it.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least once\r\nevery day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I could\r\nkill any thing fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself\r\nwith what the island produced. The first time I went out, I presently\r\ndiscovered that there were goats upon the island, which was a great\r\nsatisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to me,\r\nviz. that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was\r\nthe most difficult thing in the world to come at them: but I was not\r\ndiscouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as\r\nit soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid\r\nwait in this manner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the valleys,\r\nthough they were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible\r\nfright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the\r\nrocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that by the\r\nposition of their optics, their sight was so directed downward, that\r\nthey did not readily see objects that were above them: so, afterwards, I\r\ntook this method--I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them,\r\nand then had frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these\r\ncreatures, I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she\r\ngave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the\r\nkid stood stock still by her, till I came and took her up; and not only\r\nso, but when I carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid\r\nfollowed me quite to my enclosure; upon which, I laid down the dam, and\r\ntook the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have\r\nbred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it, and\r\neat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate\r\nsparingly, and preserved my provisions (my bread especially) as much as\r\npossibly I could.\r\n\r\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\r\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for\r\nthat, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\r\nshall give a full account of in its proper place: but I must first give\r\nsome little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which,\r\nit may well be supposed, were not a few.\r\n\r\nI had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away upon\r\nthat island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite\r\nout of the course of our intended voyage; and a great way, viz. some\r\nhundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind,\r\nI had great reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in\r\nthis desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.\r\nThe tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these\r\nreflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why\r\nProvidence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render them so\r\nabsolutely miserable; so abandoned without help, so entirely depressed,\r\nthat it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.\r\n\r\nBut something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts, and\r\nto reprove me: and particularly, one day, walking with my gun in my\r\nhand, by the sea side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\r\ncondition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,\r\nthus: \"Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray\r\nremember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you into\r\nthe boat? Where are the ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why\r\nwere you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?\" And then I\r\npointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is\r\nin them, and with what worse attends them.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\r\nsubsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened\r\n(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the\r\nplace where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore, that\r\nI had time to get all these things out of her: what would have been my\r\ncase, if I had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first\r\ncame on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and\r\nprocure them? \"Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself,) what\r\nshould I have done without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools\r\nto make any thing, or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or\r\nany manner of covering?\" and that now I had all these to a sufficient\r\nquantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to\r\nlive without my gun, when my ammunition was spent: so that I had a\r\ntolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived; for\r\nI considered, from the beginning, how I should provide for the accidents\r\nthat might happen, and for the time that was to come, not only after my\r\nammunition should be spent, but even after my health or strength\r\nshould decay.\r\n\r\nI confess, I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\r\ndestroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;\r\nand this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened\r\nand thundered, as I observed just now.\r\n\r\nAnd now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent\r\nlife, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall\r\ntake it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my\r\naccount, the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above said, I\r\nfirst set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun being to us in its\r\nautumnal equinox, was almost just over my head: for I reckoned myself,\r\nby observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north\r\nof the Line.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my\r\nthoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and\r\npen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from the working\r\ndays: but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in\r\ncapital letters; and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the\r\nshore where I first landed, viz. \"I came on shore here on the 30th of\r\nSeptember, 1659.\" Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a\r\nnotch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the\r\nrest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long one:\r\nand thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBut it happened, that among the many things which I brought out of the\r\nship, in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I\r\ngot several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me,\r\nwhich I found, some time after, in rummaging the chests; as, in\r\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the captain's,\r\nmate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four compasses, some\r\nmathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of\r\nnavigation; all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or\r\nno: also I found three very good bibles, which came to me in my cargo\r\nfrom England, and which I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese\r\nbooks also, and, among them, two or three popish prayer books, and\r\nseveral other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not\r\nforget, that we had in the ship a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent\r\nhistory I may have occasion to say something, in its place: for I\r\ncarried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the\r\nship himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with\r\nmy first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me for many years: I wanted\r\nnothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to\r\nme, I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I\r\nobserved before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to\r\nthe utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept things\r\nvery exact, but after that was gone I could not; for I could not make\r\nany ink, by any means that I could devise.\r\n\r\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all\r\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, this of ink was one; as also\r\na spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles,\r\npins, and thread: as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near\r\na whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or\r\nsurrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I\r\ncould well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods,\r\nand more, by far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days\r\nin cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in\r\ndriving it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of\r\nwood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows;\r\nwhich, however, though I found it, yet it made driving these posts or\r\npiles very laborious and tedious work. But what need I have been\r\nconcerned at the tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time\r\nenough to do it in? nor had I any other employment, if that had been\r\nover, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to\r\nseek for food; which I did, more or less, every day.\r\n\r\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstance I\r\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so\r\nmuch to leave them to any that were to come after me (for I was like to\r\nhave but few heirs,) as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon\r\nthem, and afflicting my mind: and as my reason began now to master my\r\ndespondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set\r\nthe good against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my\r\ncase from worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and\r\ncreditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus:\r\n\r\n     EVIL.\r\n\r\n     I am cast upon a horrible,\r\n     desolate island, void of all\r\n     hope of recovery.\r\n\r\n     I am singled out and separated,\r\n     as it were, from all the\r\n     world, to be miserable.\r\n\r\n     I am divided from mankind,\r\n     a solitaire; one banished\r\n     from human society.\r\n\r\n     I have no clothes to cover\r\n     me.\r\n\r\n     I am without any defence,\r\n     or means to resist any violence\r\n     of man or beast.\r\n\r\n     I have no soul to speak to,\r\n     or relieve me.\r\n\r\n\r\n     GOOD.\r\n\r\n     But I am alive; and not\r\n     drowned, as all my ship's company\r\n     were.\r\n\r\n     But I am singled out too\r\n     from all the ship's crew, to be\r\n     spared from death; and he\r\n     that miraculously save me\r\n     from death, can deliver me\r\n     from this condition.\r\n\r\n     But I am not starved, and\r\n     perishing in a barren place,\r\n     affording no sustenance.\r\n\r\n     But I am in a hot climate,\r\n     where, if I had clothes, I could\r\n     hardly wear them.\r\n\r\n     But I am cast on an island\r\n     where I see no wild beast to\r\n     hurt me, as I saw on the coast\r\n     of Africa: and what if I had\r\n     been shipwrecked there?\r\n\r\n     But God wonderfully sent\r\n     the ship in near enough to the\r\n     shore, that I have got out so\r\n     many necessary things as will\r\n     either supply my wants, or\r\n     enable me to supply myself,\r\n     even as long as I live.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there was scarce\r\nany condition in the world so miserable, but there was something\r\nnegative, or something positive, to be thankful for in it: and let this\r\nstand as a direction, from the experience of the most miserable of all\r\nconditions in this world, that we may always find in it something to\r\ncomfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and evil,\r\non the credit side of the account.\r\n\r\nHaving now, brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\r\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving\r\nover these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of\r\nliving, and to make things as easy to me as I could.\r\n\r\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\r\nof a rock,--surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I\r\nmight now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall against it\r\nof turfs, about two feet thick on the outside: and after some time (I\r\nthink it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the\r\nrock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things\r\nas I could get, to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of\r\nthe year, very violent.\r\n\r\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\r\ninto the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that\r\nat first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no\r\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I\r\nset myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it\r\nwas a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed\r\non it: and when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I\r\nworked sideways, to the right hand, into the rock, and then turning to\r\nthe right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out in the\r\noutside of my pale or fortification.\r\n\r\nThis gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back-way to my\r\ntent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods.\r\n\r\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I found\r\nI most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I was\r\nnot able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not\r\nwrite, or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure, without a\r\ntable: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason\r\nis the substance and original of the mathematics, so by stating, and\r\nsquaring every thing by reason, and by making the most rational judgment\r\nof things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I\r\nhad never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour,\r\napplication, and contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing\r\nbut I could have made, especially if I had had tools. However, I made\r\nabundance of things, even without tools; and some with no more tools\r\nthan an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way\r\nbefore, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board,\r\nI had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,\r\nand hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be\r\nas thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by\r\nthis method I could make but one board of a whole tree; but this I had\r\nno remedy for but patience, any more than I had for a prodigious deal of\r\ntime and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board: but my\r\ntime or labour was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way\r\nas another.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the\r\nfirst place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I\r\nbrought on my raft from the ship. But when I wrought out some boards, as\r\nabove, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one\r\nover another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails,\r\nand iron-work on; and, in a word, to separate every thing at large in\r\ntheir places, that I might easily come at them. I knocked pieces into\r\nthe wall of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would hang\r\nup: so that had my cave been seen, it looked like a general magazine of\r\nall necessary things; and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it\r\nwas a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and\r\nespecially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's employment;\r\nfor, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to\r\nlabour, but in much discomposure of mind; and my journal would, too,\r\nhave been full of many dull things: for example, I must have said\r\nthus--\"_Sept_. 30th. After I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning,\r\ninstead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having first\r\nvomited, with the great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my\r\nstomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing\r\nmy hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, and\r\ncrying out, 'I was undone, undone!' till, tired and faint, I was forced\r\nto lie down on the ground to repose; but durst not sleep, for fear of\r\nbeing devoured.\"\r\n\r\nSome days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got\r\nall that I could out of her, I could not forbear getting up to the top\r\nof a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship:\r\nthen fancy that, at a vast distance, I spied a sail, please myself with\r\nthe hopes of it, and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind,\r\nlose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase my\r\nmisery by my folly.\r\n\r\nBut, having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled\r\nmy household-stuff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all\r\nas handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal: of which I\r\nshall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these\r\nparticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I\r\nwas forced to leave it off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n_September_ 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being\r\nshipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on shore on\r\nthis dismal unfortunate island, which I called the ISLAND OF DESPAIR;\r\nall the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself\r\nalmost dead.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal\r\ncircumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,\r\nweapon, nor place to fly to: and, in despair of any relief, saw nothing\r\nbut death before me; that I should either be devoured by wild beasts,\r\nmurdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the\r\napproach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but\r\nslept soundly, though it rained all night.\r\n\r\n_October_ 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had\r\nfloated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer\r\nthe island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for seeing her\r\nsit upright, and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I\r\nmight get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my\r\nrelief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my\r\ncomrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board, might have\r\nsaved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned,\r\nas they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have\r\nbuilt us a boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to\r\nsome other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in\r\nperplexing myself on these things; but, at length, seeing the ship\r\nalmost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on\r\nboard. This day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st of _October_ to the 24th. All these days entirely spent in\r\nmany several voyages to get all I could out of the ship; which I brought\r\non shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days,\r\nthough with some intervals of fair weather: but, it seems, this was the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\n_Oct_. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but\r\nbeing in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered\r\nmany of them when the tide was out.\r\n\r\n_Oct_. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;\r\nduring which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little\r\nharder than before) and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,\r\nand that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and securing\r\nthe goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.\r\n\r\n_Oct_. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place\r\nto fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack\r\nin the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon\r\na proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semi-circle for my\r\nencampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or\r\nfortification, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and\r\nwithout with turf.\r\n\r\nFrom the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my goods\r\nto my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained\r\nexceedingly hard.\r\n\r\nThe 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to see\r\nfor some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and\r\nher kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it\r\nwould not feed.\r\n\r\n_November_ 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first\r\nnight; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my\r\nhammock upon.\r\n\r\n_Nov_. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber\r\nwhich made my rafts; and with them formed a fence round me, a little\r\nwithin the place I had marked out for my fortification.\r\n\r\n_Nov_. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, which\r\nwere very good food. In the afternoon I went to work to make me a table.\r\n\r\n_Nov_. 4. This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out\r\nwith my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I\r\nwalked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then\r\nemployed myself to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I had\r\nto live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather\r\nbeing excessive hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The\r\nworking part of this day and the next was wholly employed in making my\r\ntable, for I was yet but a very sorry workman: though time and necessity\r\nmade me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would\r\nany one else.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 5._ This day went abroad with my gun and dog, and killed a wild\r\ncat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing: of every\r\ncreature that I killed I took off the skins, and preserved them. Coming\r\nback by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowl which I did not\r\nunderstand: but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three\r\nseals; which, while I was gazing at them (not well knowing what they\r\nwere) got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 6._ After my morning walk, I went to work with my table again, and\r\nfinished it, though not to my liking: nor was it long before I learned\r\nto mend it.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 7._ Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,\r\n10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to my\r\nreckoning) I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado,\r\nbrought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and, even in\r\nthe making, I pulled it in pieces several times.\r\n\r\n_Note._ I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for\r\nthem on my post, I forgot which was which.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 13._ This day it rained; which refreshed me exceedingly, and\r\ncooled the earth: but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and\r\nlightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As\r\nsoon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as\r\nmany little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 14, 15, 16._ These three days I spent in making little square\r\nchests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most,\r\nof powder: and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as\r\nsecure and as remote from one another as possible. On one of these three\r\ndays I killed a large bird that was good to eat; but I knew not what\r\nto call it.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 17._ This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the rock, to\r\nmake room for my farther convenience.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz. a\r\npick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-barrow, or basket; so I desisted from my\r\nwork, and began to consider how to supply these wants, and make me some\r\ntools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were\r\nproper enough, though heavy: but, the next thing was a shovel or spade;\r\nthis was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing\r\neffectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 18._ The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that\r\nwood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the iron tree, from\r\nits exceeding hardness: of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling\r\nmy axe, I cut a piece; and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,\r\nfor it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my\r\nhaving no other way, made me a long while upon this machine; for I\r\nworked it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a shovel\r\nor spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the\r\nbroad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me\r\nso long: however, it served well enough for the uses which I had\r\noccasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after\r\nthat fashion, or so long a-making.\r\n\r\nI was still deficient: for I wanted a basket, or a wheel-barrow. A\r\nbasket I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs\r\nthat would bend to make wicker-ware; at least, none yet found out: and\r\nas to the wheel-barrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but\r\nthat I had no notion of; neither did I know how to go about it: besides,\r\nI had no possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of\r\nthe wheel to run in; so I gave it over: and, for carrying away the earth\r\nwhich I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the\r\nlabourers carry mortar in for the brick-layers. This was not so\r\ndifficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel,\r\nand the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took me up\r\nno less than four days; I mean, always excepting my morning walk with my\r\ngun, which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bringing home\r\nsomething fit to eat.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 23._ My other work having now stood still, because of my making\r\nthese tools, when they were finished I went on; and working every day,\r\nas my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in\r\nwidening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods\r\ncommodiously.\r\n\r\n_Note._ During all this time, I worked to make this room, or cave,\r\nspacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen,\r\na dining-room, and a cellar. As for a lodging, I kept to the tent;\r\nexcept that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard\r\nthat I could not keep myself dry; which caused me afterwards to cover\r\nall my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters,\r\nleaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of\r\ntrees, like a thatch.\r\n\r\n_December 10._ I began now to think my cave or vault finished; when on a\r\nsudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell\r\ndown from the top and one side: so much, that, in short, it frightened\r\nme, and not without reason too; for if I had been under it, I should\r\nnever have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal\r\nof work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and,\r\nwhich was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I\r\nmight be sure no more would come down.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 11._ This day I went to work with it accordingly; and got two\r\nshores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of board\r\nacross over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more\r\nposts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured; and\r\nthe posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off\r\nmy house.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17._ From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, and knocked up\r\nnails on the posts, to hang every thing up that could be hung up: and\r\nnow I began to be in some order within doors.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 20._ I carried every thing into the cave, and began to furnish my\r\nhouse, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my\r\nvictuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me: also I made\r\nme another table.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 24._ Much rain all night and all day: no stirring out.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 25._ Rain all day.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 26._ No rain; and the earth much cooler than before, and\r\npleasanter.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 27._ Killed a young goat; and lamed another, so that I catched it,\r\nand led it home in a string: when I had it home, I bound and splintered\r\nup its leg, which was broke.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew well, and\r\nas strong as ever: but, by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed\r\nupon the little green at my door, and would not go away. This was the\r\nfirst time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame\r\ncreatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31._ Great heats, and no breeze; so that there was no\r\nstirring abroad, except in the evening, for food: this time I spent in\r\nputting all my things in order within doors.\r\n\r\n_January 1._ Very hot still; but I went abroad early and late with my\r\ngun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going farther\r\ninto the vallies which lay towards the centre of the island, I found\r\nthere was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come at;\r\nhowever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them\r\ndown. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog, and set him\r\nupon the goats: but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the\r\ndog: and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 3._ I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my\r\nbeing attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said\r\nin the journal: it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time\r\nthan from the 3d of January to the 14th of April, working, finishing,\r\nand perfecting this wall; though it was no more than about 25 yards in\r\nlength, being a half-circle, from one place in the rock to another\r\nplace, about twelve yards from it, the door of the cave being in the\r\ncentre, behind it.\r\n\r\nAll this time I worked very hard; the rains hindering me many days, nay,\r\nsometimes weeks together: but I thought I should never be perfectly\r\nsecure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what\r\ninexpressible labour every thing was done with, especially the bringing\r\npiles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground; for I made\r\nthem much bigger than I needed to have done.\r\n\r\nWhen this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, with a\r\nturf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people\r\nwere to come on shore there they would not perceive any thing like a\r\nhabitation: and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter,\r\nupon a very remarkable occasion.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game every day,\r\nwhen the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries, in these\r\nwalks, of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a\r\nkind of wild pigeons, who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but\r\nrather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks: and, taking some\r\nyoung ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but when\r\nthey grew older, they flew all away; which, perhaps, was at first for\r\nwant of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them: however, I\r\nfrequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very\r\ngood meat. And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found myself\r\nwanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for\r\nme to make; as indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance, I could\r\nnever make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I\r\nobserved before; but I could never arrive to the capacity of making one\r\nby them, though I spent many weeks about it: I could neither put in the\r\nheads, nor join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold\r\nwater; so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was at a great\r\nloss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by\r\nseven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remember the lump of\r\nbees-wax with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had\r\nnone of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a\r\ngoat, I saved the tallow; and with a little dish made of clay, which I\r\nbaked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a\r\nlamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a\r\ncandle. In the middle of all my labours it happened, that in rummaging\r\nmy things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted before, had been\r\nfilled with corn, for the feeding of poultry; not for this voyage, but\r\nbefore, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. What little\r\nremainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured with the rats,\r\nand I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to\r\nhave the bag for some other use (I think, it was to put powder in, when\r\nI divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,) I shook the\r\nhusks of corn out of it, on one side of my fortification, under\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that I threw\r\nthis stuff away; taking no notice of any thing, and not so much as\r\nremembering that I had thrown any thing there: when about a month after,\r\nI saw some few stalks of something green, shooting out of the ground,\r\nwhich I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised,\r\nand perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about\r\nten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley of the same\r\nkind as our European, nay, as our English barley.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my\r\nthoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto acted upon no religious\r\nfoundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my\r\nhead, nor had entertained any sense of any thing that had befallen me,\r\notherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God;\r\nwithout so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,\r\nor his order in governing events in the world. But after I saw barley\r\ngrow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and\r\nespecially as I knew not how it came there, it startled me strangely;\r\nand I began to suggest, that God had miraculously caused this grain to\r\ngrow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed purely\r\nfor my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.\r\n\r\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes; and I\r\nbegan to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon\r\nmy account: and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it\r\nstill, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,\r\nwhich proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen\r\nit grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.\r\n\r\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my\r\nsupport, but, not doubting that there was more in the place, I went over\r\nall that part of the island where I had been before, searching in every\r\ncorner, and under every rock, for more of it; but I could not find any.\r\nAt last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of\r\nchicken's-meat in that place, and then the wonder began to cease: and I\r\nmust confess, my religious thankfulness to God's providence began to\r\nabate too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was\r\ncommon; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and\r\nunforeseen a providence, as if it had been miraculous: for it was really\r\nthe work of Providence, as to me, that should order or appoint that ten\r\nor twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had\r\ndestroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropt from heaven; as also,\r\nthat I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in\r\nthe shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had\r\nthrown it any where else, at that time, it would have been burnt up and\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their\r\nseason, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I\r\nresolved to sow them all again; hoping, in time, to have some quantity\r\nsufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year\r\nthat I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even\r\nthen but sparingly, as I shall show afterwards, in its order; for I lost\r\nall that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time; as\r\nI sowed just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at\r\nleast not as it would have done; of which in its place.\r\n\r\nBesides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of\r\nrice, which I preserved with the same care; and whose use was of the\r\nsame kind, or to the same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rather\r\nfood; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that\r\nalso after some time.--But to return to my Journal.\r\n\r\nI worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my wall\r\ndone; and the 14th of April I closed it up; contriving to get into it,\r\nnot by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no\r\nsign on the outside of my habitation.\r\n\r\n_April 16._ I finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder to the\r\ntop, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside: this\r\nwas a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and\r\nnothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount\r\nmy wall.\r\n\r\nThe very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my\r\nlabour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the case was thus:--As I\r\nwas busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the entrance into\r\nmy cave, I was terribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing\r\nindeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down from\r\nthe roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two\r\nof the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I\r\nwas heartily scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause,\r\nonly thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had\r\ndone before: and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my\r\nladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall\r\nfor fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down upon\r\nme. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly\r\nsaw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three\r\ntimes at about eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as would\r\nhave overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have\r\nstood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood\r\nabout half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down, with such a terrible\r\nnoise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also that the very\r\nsea was put into a violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were\r\nstronger under the water than on the island.\r\n\r\nI was so much amazed with the thing itself (having never felt the like,\r\nnor discoursed with any one that had) that I was like one dead or\r\nstupified; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one\r\nthat was tossed at sea: but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked\r\nme, as it were; and rousing me from the stupified condition I was in,\r\nfilled me with horror, and I thought of nothing but the hill falling\r\nupon my tent and my household goods, and burying all at once; this sunk\r\nmy very soul within me a second time.\r\n\r\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I\r\nbegan to take courage; yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall\r\nagain, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground\r\ngreatly cast down, and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this\r\nwhile, I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but the\r\ncommon _Lord, have mercy upon me!_ and when it was over, that went\r\naway too.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it\r\nwould rain; and soon after the wind rose by little, and little, so that\r\nin less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the sea\r\nwas, all on a sudden, covered with foam and froth; the shore was covered\r\nwith a breach of the water; the trees were torn up by the roots; and a\r\nterrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and then began to\r\nabate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very\r\nhard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and\r\ndejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds\r\nand rain being the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake itself\r\nwas spent and over, and I might venture into my cave again. With this\r\nthought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to\r\npersuade me, I went in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so\r\nviolent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was\r\nforced to get into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear\r\nit should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new work,\r\nviz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the\r\nwater go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in\r\nmy cave for some time, and found no more shocks of the earthquake\r\nfollow, I began to be more composed. And now to support my spirits,\r\nwhich indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a\r\nsmall sup of rum; which, however, I did then, and always, very\r\nsparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone. It continued\r\nraining all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could\r\nnot stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think of\r\nwhat I had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to these\r\nearthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must\r\nconsider of building me some little hut in an open place, which I might\r\nsurround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure from\r\nwild beasts or men; for if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one\r\ntime or other, be buried alive.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where\r\nit now stood, being just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and\r\nwhich, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent.\r\nI spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in\r\ncontriving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being\r\nswallowed alive affected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the\r\napprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost equal to it:\r\nbut still, when I looked about, and saw how every thing was put in\r\norder, how pleasantly I was concealed, and how safe from danger, it made\r\nme very loth to remove. In the mean time, it occurred to me that it\r\nwould require a vast deal of time for me to do this; and that I must be\r\ncontented to run the risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient\r\ncamp, and secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion I\r\ncomposed myself for a time; and resolved that I would go to work with\r\nall speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a circle as\r\nbefore, and set up my tent in it when it was finished; but that I would\r\nventure to stay where I was till it was ready, and fit to remove to.\r\nThis was the 21st.\r\n\r\n_April_ 22. The next morning I began to consider of means to put this\r\nmeasure into execution; but I was at a great loss about the tools. I had\r\nthree large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets\r\nfor traffic with the Indians;) but with much chopping and cutting knotty\r\nhard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a\r\ngrind-stone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This caused me\r\nas much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point\r\nof politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I\r\ncontrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might\r\nhave both my hands at liberty.\r\n\r\n_Note._ I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least not to\r\ntake notice how it was done, though since I have observed it is very\r\ncommon there: besides that, my grind-stone was very large and heavy.\r\nThis machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.\r\n\r\n_April 28, 29._ These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my\r\nmachine for turning my grind-stone performing very well.\r\n\r\n_April 30._ Having perceived that my bread had been low a great while, I\r\nnow took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day,\r\nwhich made my heart very heavy.\r\n\r\n_May 1._ In the morning, looking toward the sea-side, the tide being\r\nlow, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it\r\nlooked like a cask: when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two\r\nor three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by\r\nthe late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it\r\nseemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the\r\nbarrel that was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of\r\ngunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a\r\nstone: however, I rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and\r\nwent on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to\r\nlook for more.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. The\r\nforecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six\r\nfeet: and the stern (which was broke to pieces, and parted from the\r\nrest, by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her)\r\nwas tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side: and the sand was\r\nthrown so high on that side next her stern, that I could now walk quite\r\nup to her when the tide was out; whereas there was a great piece of\r\nwater before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the\r\nwreck without swimming. I was surprised with this at first, but soon\r\nconcluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the\r\nship was more broke open than formerly, so many things came daily on\r\nshore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled\r\nby degrees to the land.\r\n\r\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my\r\nhabitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in\r\nsearching whether I could make any way into the ship: but I found\r\nnothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship\r\nwas choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of any\r\nthing, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the\r\nship, concluding that every thing I could get from her would be of some\r\nuse or other to me.\r\n\r\n_May 3._ I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which I\r\nthought held some of the upper part or quarter deck together; and when I\r\nhad cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the\r\nside which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give\r\nover for that time.\r\n\r\n_May 4._ I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of,\r\ntill I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a\r\nyoung dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no\r\nhooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat;\r\nall which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.\r\n\r\n_May 5._ Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought\r\nthree great fir-planks off from the decks; which I tied together, and\r\nmade swim on shore when the tide of flood came on.\r\n\r\n_May 6._ Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her, and\r\nother pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and came home very much\r\ntired, and had thoughts of giving it over.\r\n\r\n_May 7._ Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to work; but\r\nfound the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being\r\ncut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose; and the inside\r\nof the hold lay so open that I could see into it; but almost full of\r\nwater and sand.\r\n\r\n_May 8._ Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the\r\ndeck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched up two\r\nplanks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron\r\ncrow in the wreck for next day.\r\n\r\n_May 9._ Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of\r\nthe wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but\r\ncould not break them up. I felt also a roll of English lead, and could\r\nstir it; but it was too heavy to remove.\r\n\r\n_May 10--14._ Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces\r\nof timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\n_May 15._ I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off\r\nthe roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it\r\nwith the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I\r\ncould not make any blow to drive the hatchet.\r\n\r\n_May 16._ It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more\r\nbroken by the force of the water; but I staid so long in the woods, to\r\nget pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n_May 17._ I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great\r\ndistance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and\r\nfound it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.\r\n\r\n_May 24._ Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard\r\nlabour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first\r\nblowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests:\r\nbut the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but\r\npieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but\r\nthe salt-water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every\r\nday to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food; which I\r\nalways appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide\r\nwas up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out: and by this time I\r\nhad gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work, enough to have built a\r\ngood boat, if I had known how: and I also got, at several times, and in\r\nseveral pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.\r\n\r\n_June 16._ Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise, or\r\nturtle. This was the first I had seen; which, it seems, was only my\r\nmisfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity: for had I happened\r\nto be on the other side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them\r\nevery day, as I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n_June 17._ I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore\r\neggs: and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and\r\npleasant that I ever tasted in my life; having had no flesh, but of\r\ngoats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.\r\n\r\n_June 18._ Rained all that day, and I staid within. I thought, at this\r\ntime, the rain felt cold, and I was somewhat chilly; which I knew was\r\nnot usual in that latitude.\r\n\r\n_June 19._ Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.\r\n\r\n_June 20._ No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.\r\n\r\n_June 21._ Very ill; frightened almost to death with the apprehensions\r\nof my sad condition, to be sick, and no help: prayed to God, for the\r\nfirst time since the storm off Hull; but scarce knew what I said, or\r\nwhy, my thoughts being all confused.\r\n\r\n_June 22._ A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n_June 23._ Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent\r\nhead-ache.\r\n\r\n_June 24._ Much better.\r\n\r\n_June 25._ An ague very violent: the fit held me seven hours; cold fit,\r\nand hot, with faint sweats after it.\r\n\r\n_June 26._ Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found\r\nmyself very weak: however, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty\r\ngot it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed\r\nit, and made some broth, but had no pot.\r\n\r\n_June 27._ The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and\r\nneither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I\r\nhad not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.\r\nPrayed to God again, but was light-headed: and when I was not, I was so\r\nignorant that I knew not what to say; only lay and cried, \"Lord, look\r\nupon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!\" I suppose I did\r\nnothing else for two or three hours; till the fit wearing off, I fell\r\nasleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found\r\nmyself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty: however, as I\r\nhad no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,\r\nand went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream:\r\nI thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall,\r\nwhere I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a\r\nman descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and\r\nlight upon the ground: he was all over as bright as a flame, so that I\r\ncould but just bear to look towards him: his countenance was most\r\ninexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe: when he\r\nstepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,\r\njust as it had done before in the earthquake; and all the air looked, to\r\nmy apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He had\r\nno sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a\r\nlong spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a\r\nrising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so\r\nterrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it: all that I\r\ncan say I understood, was this: \"Seeing all these things have not\r\nbrought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;\" at which words I\r\nthought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand, to kill me.\r\n\r\nNo one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I should be\r\nable to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision; I mean,\r\nthat even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors; nor is\r\nit any more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my\r\nmind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.\r\n\r\nI had, alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by the good\r\ninstruction of my father was then worn out, by an uninterrupted series,\r\nfor eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation\r\nwith none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last\r\ndegree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that\r\nso much as tended either to looking upward towards God, or inward\r\ntowards a reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity of soul,\r\nwithout desire of good, or consciousness of evil, had entirely\r\noverwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked\r\ncreature among our common sailors, can be supposed to be; not having\r\nthe least sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, or of\r\nthankfulness to him, in deliverances.\r\n\r\nIn the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more\r\neasily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety of\r\nmiseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one\r\nthought of its being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment\r\nfor my sin; either my rebellious behaviour against my father, or my\r\npresent sins, which were great; or even as a punishment for the general\r\ncourse of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the\r\ndesert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what\r\nwould become of me; or one wish to God to direct me whither I should go,\r\nor to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well\r\nfrom voracious creatures as cruel savages: but I was quite thoughtless\r\nof a God or a Providence; acted like a mere brute, from the principles\r\nof nature, and by the dictates of common sense only; and indeed hardly\r\nthat. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese\r\ncaptain, well used, and dealt with justly and honourably, as well as\r\ncharitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When,\r\nagain, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this\r\nisland, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment: I\r\nonly said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be\r\nalways miserable.\r\n\r\nIt is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all my ship's crew\r\ndrowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and\r\nsome transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might\r\nhave come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began, in a\r\nmere common flight of joy; or, as I may say, being glad I was alive,\r\nwithout the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand\r\nwhich had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all\r\nthe rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been thus\r\nmerciful to me: just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally\r\nhave, after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown\r\nall in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over:\r\nand all the rest of my life was like it. Even when I was, afterwards, on\r\ndue consideration, made sensible of my condition,--how I was cast on\r\nthis dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of\r\nrelief, or prospect of redemption,--as soon as I saw but a prospect of\r\nliving, and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the\r\nsense of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very easy, applied\r\nmyself to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far\r\nenough from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven,\r\nor as the hand of God against me: these were thoughts which very seldom\r\nentered into my head.\r\n\r\nThe growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had, at first,\r\nsome little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness,\r\nas long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as\r\nthat part of the thought was removed, all the impression which was\r\nraised from it wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the\r\nearthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or\r\nmore immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs\r\nsuch things, yet no sooner was the fright over, but the impression it\r\nhad made went off also. I had no more sense of God, or his judgments,\r\nmuch less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from his\r\nhand, than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life. But\r\nnow, when I began to be sick, and a leisure view of the miseries of\r\ndeath came to place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink\r\nunder the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with\r\nthe violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to\r\nawake; and I reproached myself with my past life, in which I had so\r\nevidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me\r\nunder uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.\r\nThese reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my\r\ndistemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful\r\nreproaches of my conscience, extorted from me some words like praying to\r\nGod: though I cannot say it was a prayer attended either with desires or\r\nwith hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress. My\r\nthoughts were confused; the convictions great upon my mind; and the\r\nhorror of dying in such a miserable condition, raised vapours in my head\r\nwith the mere apprehension: and, in these hurries of my soul, I knew not\r\nwhat my tongue might express: but it was rather exclamation, such as,\r\n\"Lord, what a miserable creature am I! If I should be sick, I shall\r\ncertainly die for want of help; and what will become of me?\" Then the\r\ntears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In\r\nthis interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and\r\npresently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this\r\nstory, viz. that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless\r\nme; and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected\r\nhis counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. \"Now,\"\r\nsaid I, aloud, \"my dear father's words are come to pass; God's justice\r\nhas overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the\r\nvoice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a station of life\r\nwherein I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it\r\nmyself, nor learn from my parents to know the blessing of it. I left\r\nthem to mourn over my folly; and now I am left to mourn under the\r\nconsequences of it: I refused their help and assistance, who would have\r\npushed me in the world, and would have made every thing easy to me; and\r\nnow I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature\r\nitself to support; and no assistance, no comfort, no advice.\" Then I\r\ncried out, \"Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress.\" This was the\r\nfirst prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years. But I\r\nreturn to my Journal.\r\n\r\n_June 28._ Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and\r\nthe fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror\r\nof my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague\r\nwould return again the next day, and now was my time to get something to\r\nrefresh and support myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did\r\nwas to fill a large square case-bottle with water; and set it upon my\r\ntable, in reach of my bed: and to take off the chill or aguish\r\ndisposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into\r\nit, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh,\r\nand broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about;\r\nbut was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense\r\nof my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next\r\nday. At night, I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs; which I\r\nroasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell: and this was\r\nthe first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I could\r\nremember, in my whole life. After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but\r\nfound myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never\r\nwent out without that;) so I went but a little way, and sat down upon\r\nthe ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very\r\ncalm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred to\r\nme: What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? Whence is\r\nit produced? And what am I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame,\r\nhuman and brutal? Whence are we? Surely, we are all made by some secret\r\npower, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is that?\r\nThen it followed most naturally, It is God that has made all. Well, but\r\nthen, it came on strangely, if God has made all these things, he guides\r\nand governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the power\r\nthat could make all things, must certainly have power to guide and\r\ndirect them: if so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his\r\nworks, either without his knowledge or appointment.\r\n\r\nAnd if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I am here,\r\nand am in this dreadful condition: and if nothing happens without his\r\nappointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to\r\nmy thought, to contradict any of these conclusions: and therefore it\r\nrested upon me with the greatest force, that it must needs be that God\r\nhad appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought to this\r\nmiserable circumstance by his direction, he having the sole power, not\r\nof me only, but of every thing that happens in the world. Immediately it\r\nfollowed, Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus used?\r\nMy conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had\r\nblasphemed; and methought it spoke to me like a voice, \"Wretch! dost\r\n_thou_ ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life,\r\nand ask thyself, what thou hast _not_ done? Ask, why is it that thou\r\nwert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth\r\nRoads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man of\r\nwar; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned\r\n_here_, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost _thou_ ask what\r\nthou hast done?\" I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one\r\nastonished, and had not a word to say; no, not to answer to myself; and,\r\nrising up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went over my\r\nwall, as if I bad been going to bed: but my thoughts were sadly\r\ndisturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in the\r\nchair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the\r\napprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it\r\noccurred to my thought, that the Brazilians take no physic but their\r\ntobacco for almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of\r\ntobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured; and some also that\r\nwas green, and not quite cured.\r\n\r\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt: for in this chest I found a cure\r\nboth for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,\r\nviz. the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took\r\nout one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I\r\nhad not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I say, I\r\ntook it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.\r\nWhat use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, nor\r\nwhether it was good for it or not; but I tried several experiments with\r\nit, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a\r\npiece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth; which, indeed, at first,\r\nalmost stupified my brain; the tobacco being green and strong, and such\r\nas I had not been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour\r\nor two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down:\r\nand, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close\r\nover the smoke of it as long as I could bear it; as well for the heat,\r\nas almost for suffocation. In the interval of this operation, I took up\r\nthe Bible, and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with\r\nthe tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened\r\nthe book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these: \"Call\r\non me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt\r\nglorify me.\" These words were very apt to my case; and made some\r\nimpression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so\r\nmuch as they did afterwards; for, as for being _delivered_, the word had\r\nno sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in\r\nmy apprehension of things, that, as the children of Israel said when\r\nthey were promised flesh to eat, \"Can God spread a table in the\r\nwilderness?\" so I began to say, Can even God himself deliver me from\r\nthis place? And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared,\r\nthis prevailed very often upon my thoughts: but, however, the words made\r\na great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It now\r\ngrew late; and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I\r\ninclined to sleep: so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should\r\nwant any thing in the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I\r\ndid what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled down, and prayed to\r\nGod to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon him in the day of\r\ntrouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was\r\nover, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco; which was so\r\nstrong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down:\r\nimmediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently the rum flew up\r\ninto my head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no\r\nmore till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon the next day: nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion, that I\r\nslept all the next day and night, and till almost three the day after;\r\nfor otherwise, I know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in\r\nthe days of the week, as it appeared some years after I had done; for if\r\nI had lost it by crossing and re-crossing the Line, I should have lost\r\nmore than one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never\r\nknew which way. Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I\r\nfound myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful:\r\nwhen I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach\r\nbetter, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but\r\ncontinued much altered for the better. This was the 29th.\r\n\r\nThe 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad with my gun, but\r\ndid not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something\r\nlike a brand goose, and brought them home; but was not very forward to\r\neat them; so I ate some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good.\r\nThis evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good\r\nthe day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so\r\nmuch as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the\r\nsmoke: however, I was not so well the next day, which was the 1st of\r\nJuly, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little of the cold fit,\r\nbut it was not much.\r\n\r\n_July 2._ I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself\r\nwith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.\r\n\r\n_July 3._ I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my\r\nfull strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering strength,\r\nmy thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, \"I will deliver thee;\"\r\nand the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of\r\nmy ever expecting it: but as I was discouraging myself with such\r\nthoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my\r\ndeliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance\r\nI had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions\r\nas these, viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from\r\nsickness; from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was\r\nso frightful to me? and what notice have I taken of it? Have I done my\r\npart? God has delivered me, but I have not glorified him; that is to\r\nsay, I have not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance: and\r\nhow can I expect a greater deliverance? This touched my heart very much;\r\nand immediately I knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery\r\nfrom my sickness.\r\n\r\n_July 4._ In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New\r\nTestament, I began seriously to read it; and imposed upon myself to read\r\nawhile every morning and every night; not binding myself to the number\r\nof chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not\r\nlong after I set seriously to this work, that I found my heart more\r\ndeeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The\r\nimpression of my dream revived; and the words, \"All these things have\r\nnot brought thee to repentance,\" ran seriously in my thoughts. I was\r\nearnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened\r\nprovidentially, the very same day, that, reading the scripture, I came\r\nto these words, \"He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour; to give\r\nrepentance, and to give remission.\" I threw down the book; and with my\r\nheart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of\r\njoy, I cried out aloud, \"Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted\r\nPrince and Saviour! give me repentance!\" This was the first time in all\r\nmy life I could say, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed; for\r\nnow I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a true scripture\r\nview of hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God: and from\r\nthis time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me.\r\n\r\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above, \"Call on me, and I\r\nwill deliver thee,\" in a different sense from what I had ever done\r\nbefore; for then I had no notion of any thing being called\r\n_deliverance_, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in: for\r\nthough I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly\r\na prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the world. But now I\r\nlearned to take it in another sense: now I looked back upon my past life\r\nwith such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought\r\nnothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all\r\nmy comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much\r\nas pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all of no\r\nconsideration, in comparison with this. And I add this part here, to\r\nhint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense\r\nof things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing\r\nthan deliverance from affliction. But, leaving this part, I return to\r\nmy Journal.\r\n\r\nMy condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of\r\nliving, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by\r\nconstantly reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a\r\nhigher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I\r\nknew nothing of; also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred\r\nme to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my way of\r\nliving as regular as I could.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking\r\nabout with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man\r\nthat was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness: for it is\r\nhardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced.\r\nThe application which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what\r\nhad never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one to\r\npractise, by this experiment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet\r\nit rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in\r\nmy nerves and limbs for some time: I learned from it also this, in\r\nparticular; that being abroad in the rainy season was the most\r\npernicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those rains\r\nwhich came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain\r\nwhich came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such\r\nstorms, so I found that this rain was much more dangerous than the rain\r\nwhich fell in September and October.\r\n\r\nI had now been in this unhappy island above ten months: all possibility\r\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;\r\nand I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon that\r\nplace. Having secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I\r\nhad a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and\r\nto see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey\r\nof the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I\r\nbrought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up,\r\nthat the tide did not flow any higher; and that it was no more than a\r\nlittle brook of running water, very fresh and good: but this being the\r\ndry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it; at least,\r\nnot any stream. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant\r\nsavannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass: and on the\r\nrising parts of them, next to the higher grounds (where the water as it\r\nmight be supposed, never overflowed,) I found a great deal of tobacco,\r\ngreen, and growing to a very great and strong stalk: and there were\r\ndivers other plants, which I had no knowledge of, or understanding\r\nabout, and that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I\r\ncould not find out. I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians,\r\nin all that climate, make their bread of; but I could find none. I saw\r\nlarge plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several\r\nsugar-canes, but wild; and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I\r\ncontented myself with these discoveries for this time; and came back,\r\nmusing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and\r\ngoodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover; but\r\ncould bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little\r\nobservation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants\r\nin the field; at least, very little that might serve me to any purpose\r\nnow in my distress.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and after going\r\nsomething farther than I had gone the day before, I found the brook and\r\nthe savannahs begin to cease, and the country become more woody than\r\nbefore. In this part I found different fruits; and particularly I found\r\nmelons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees:\r\nthe vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, and the clusters of grapes\r\nwere now just in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising\r\ndiscovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned by my\r\nexperience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when I was ashore\r\nin Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who\r\nwere slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. I found,\r\nhowever, an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry\r\nthem in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept;\r\nwhich I thought would be (as indeed they were) as wholesome and as\r\nagreeable to eat, when no grapes were to be had.\r\n\r\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\r\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from\r\nhome. At night, I took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree,\r\nwhere I slept well; and the next morning proceeded on my discovery,\r\ntravelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length of the\r\nvalley; keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and\r\nnorth sides of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening, where\r\nthe country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh\r\nwater, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other\r\nway, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so\r\nflourishing, every thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of\r\nspring, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on\r\nthe side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of\r\npleasure (though mixed with other afflicting thoughts,) to think that\r\nthis was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country\r\nindefeasibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey it,\r\nI might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in\r\nEngland. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, and orange, lemon, and\r\ncitron trees, but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit; at least not\r\nthen. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to\r\neat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,\r\nwhich made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now\r\nI had business enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up\r\na store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons to furnish myself for the\r\nwet season, which I knew was approaching. In order to this, I gathered a\r\ngreat heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place; and a\r\ngreat parcel of limes and melons in another place; and, taking a few of\r\neach with me, I travelled homeward; and resolved to come again, and\r\nbring a bag or sack, or what I could make to carry the rest home.\r\nAccordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I\r\nmust now call my tent and my cave:) but before I got thither, the grapes\r\nwere spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the juice,\r\nhaving broken and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing: as\r\nto the limes, they were good, but I could bring only a few.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small bags\r\nto bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when, coming to my heap\r\nof grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, I found\r\nthem all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here,\r\nsome there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there\r\nwere some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this, but what they\r\nwere I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them up in\r\nheaps, and no carrying them away in a sack; but that one way they would\r\nbe destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own\r\nweight; I took another course: I then gathered a large quantity of the\r\ngrapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they\r\nmight cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I\r\ncarried as many back as I could well stand under.\r\n\r\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\r\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\r\nthe security from storms on that side; the water and the wood: and\r\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode in, which was\r\nby far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to\r\nconsider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally\r\nsafe as where I was now situate; if possible, in that pleasant fruitful\r\npart of the island.\r\n\r\nThis thought ran long in my head; and I was exceeding fond of it for\r\nsome time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me: but when I came to\r\na nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea-side, where\r\nit was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage,\r\nand, by the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring some other\r\nunhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable\r\nthat any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the\r\nhills and woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my\r\nbondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but\r\nimpossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.\r\nHowever, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time\r\nthere for the whole remaining part of the month of July; and though,\r\nupon second thoughts, I resolved, as above stated, not to remove; yet I\r\nbuilt me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with\r\na strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well\r\nstaked, and filled between with brush-wood. Here I lay very secure,\r\nsometimes two or three nights together; always going over it with a\r\nladder, as before: so that I fancied now I had my country and my\r\nsea-coast house. This work took me up till the beginning of August.\r\n\r\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when\r\nthe rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation: for\r\nthough I had made a tent like the other, with a piece of sail, and\r\nspread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from\r\nstorms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and\r\nbegan to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I found the grapes I had hung\r\nup were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins of the\r\nsun: so I began to take them down from the trees; and it was very happy\r\nthat I did so, as the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and\r\nI should have lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two\r\nhundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and\r\ncarried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain: and from\r\nhence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day\r\ntill the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not\r\nstir out of my cave for several days.\r\n\r\nIn this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family. I\r\nhad been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me,\r\nor, as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more of her, till, to my\r\nastonishment, she came home with three kittens. This was the more\r\nstrange to me, because, about the end of August, though I had killed a\r\nwild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a\r\ndifferent kind from our European cats: yet the young cats were the same\r\nkind of house-breed as the old one; and both of my cats being females, I\r\nthought it very strange. But from these three, I afterwards came to be\r\nso pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or\r\nwild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; so that I could not\r\nstir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement,\r\nI began to be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, I one day\r\nkilled a goat, and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large\r\ntortoise, which was a treat to me. My food was now regulated thus: I ate\r\na bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of\r\nthe turtle, broiled, for my dinner (for, to my great misfortune, I had\r\nno vessel to boil or stew any thing;) and two or three of the turtle's\r\neggs for my supper.\r\n\r\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or\r\nthree hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards\r\none side, till I came to the outside of the hill; and made a door, or\r\nway out, which came beyond my fence or wall: and so I came in and out\r\nthis way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open: for as I had\r\nmanaged myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, I\r\nthought I lay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there was any\r\nliving thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the\r\nisland being a goat.\r\n\r\n_September_ 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.\r\nI cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three\r\nhundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast; setting\r\nit apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\r\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\r\nhis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me\r\nthrough Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least refreshment for\r\ntwelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit\r\nand a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it.\r\nI had all this time observed no sabbath-day; for as at first I had no\r\nsense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to\r\ndistinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the\r\nsabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the days were: but\r\nnow having cast up the days, as above, I found I had been there a year;\r\nso I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a\r\nsabbath: though I found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or\r\ntwo in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink beginning to fail me, I\r\ncontented myself to use it more sparingly; and to write down only the\r\nmost remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum\r\nof other things.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,\r\nand I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but\r\nI bought all my experience before I had it; and what I am going to\r\nrelate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I had made\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley, and rice,\r\nwhich I had so surprisingly found sprung up, as I thought, of\r\nthemselves. I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about\r\ntwenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the\r\nrains; the sun being in its southern position, going from me.\r\nAccordingly I dug a piece of ground, as well as I could, with my wooden\r\nspade; and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but, as I was\r\nsowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all\r\nat first, because I did not know when was the proper time for it; so I\r\nsowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each: and\r\nit was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain\r\nof what I sowed this time came to any thing; for the dry month\r\nfollowing, and the earth having thus had no rain after the seed was\r\nsown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all\r\ntill the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been\r\nbut newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily\r\nimagined was from the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to\r\nmake another trial in; and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,\r\nand sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal\r\nequinox. This having the rainy month of March and April to water it,\r\nsprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having only\r\npart of the seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had, I got but a\r\nsmall quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck\r\nof each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of my business,\r\nand knew exactly when was the proper time to sow; and that I might\r\nexpect two seed-times, and two harvests, every year.\r\n\r\nWhile this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which was of use\r\nto me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began\r\nto settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the\r\ncountry to my bower; where, though I had not been some months, yet I\r\nfound all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I\r\nhad made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut\r\nout of some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown\r\nwith long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first\r\nyear after lopping its head; but I could not tell what tree to call it\r\nthat these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well\r\npleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them to\r\ngrow as much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how beautiful a\r\nfigure they grew into in three years: so that, though the hedge made a\r\ncircle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I\r\nmight now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade,\r\nsufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to\r\ncut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle\r\nround my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling,) which I did; and\r\nplacing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards\r\ndistance from my first fence, they grew presently; and were at first a\r\nfine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also;\r\nas I shall observe in its order.\r\n\r\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not\r\ninto summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the\r\ndry seasons, which were generally thus: From the middle of February to\r\nthe middle of April, rainy; the sun being then on or near the equinox.\r\nFrom the middle of April till the middle of August, dry; the sun being\r\nthen north of the line. From the middle of August till the middle of\r\nOctober, rainy; the sun being then come back to the line. From the\r\nmiddle of October till the middle of February, dry; the sun being then\r\nto the south of the line.\r\n\r\nThe rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, as the\r\nwinds happened to blow; but this was the general observation I made.\r\nAfter I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad\r\nin the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand,\r\nthat I might not be obliged to go out: and I sat within doors as much as\r\npossible during the wet months. In this time I found much employment,\r\nand very suitable also to the time; for I found great occasion for many\r\nthings which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour and\r\nconstant application: particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a\r\nbasket: but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle,\r\nthat they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now,\r\nthat when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a\r\nbasketmaker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make their\r\nwicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and\r\na great observer of the manner how they worked those things, and\r\nsometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the\r\nmethods of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came\r\ninto my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes\r\nthat grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and\r\nosiers, in England; and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I\r\nwent to my country house, as I called it; and cutting some of the\r\nsmaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire:\r\nwhereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a\r\nquantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These\r\nI set up to dry within my circle or hedge; and when they were fit for\r\nuse, I carried them to my cave: and here, during the next season, I\r\nemployed myself in making, as well as I could, several baskets; both to\r\ncarry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had occasion for.\r\nThough I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them\r\nsufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, afterwards, I took\r\ncare never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made\r\nmore; especially strong deep baskets, to place my corn in, instead of\r\nsacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.\r\n\r\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,\r\nI bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two other wants. I\r\nhad no vessel to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets,\r\nwhich were almost full of rum; and some glass bottles, some of the\r\ncommon size, and others (which were case-bottles) square, for the\r\nholding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil\r\nanything; except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and\r\nwhich was too big for such use as I desired it, viz. to make broth, and\r\nstew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had,\r\nwas a tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible for me to make one; however, I\r\nfound a contrivance for that too at last. I employed myself in planting\r\nmy second row of stakes or piles, and also in this wicker-working, all\r\nthe summer or dry season; when another business took me up more time\r\nthan it could be imagined I could spare.\r\n\r\nI mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole island; and\r\nthat I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I had built my\r\nbower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of\r\nthe island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore, on\r\nthat side: so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger\r\nquantity of powder and shot than usual; with two biscuit-cakes, and a\r\ngreat bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my store; I began my journey.\r\nWhen I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within\r\nview of the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly\r\ndescried land, whether an island or continent I could not tell; but it\r\nlay very high, extending from W. to W.S.W. at a very great distance; by\r\nmy guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\r\n\r\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be; otherwise than\r\nthat I knew it must be part of America; and, as I concluded, by all my\r\nobservations, must be near the Spanish dominions; and perhaps was all\r\ninhabited by savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a\r\nworse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced in the\r\ndispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe\r\nordered every thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this,\r\nand left off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.\r\n\r\nBesides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered that if this\r\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\r\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the\r\nsavage coast between the Spanish country and the Brazils, whose\r\ninhabitants are indeed the worst of savages; for they are cannibals, or\r\nmen-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all human beings that fall\r\ninto their hands.\r\n\r\nWith these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, I found this\r\nside of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter than mine; the open\r\nor savannah fields sweetly adorned with flowers and grass, and full of\r\nvery fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots; and fain would have caught\r\none, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to\r\nme. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young parrot: for I knocked\r\nit down with a stick, and, having recovered it, I brought it home: but\r\nit was some years before I could make him speak; however, at last I\r\ntaught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the accident that\r\nfollowed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.\r\n\r\nI was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in the low grounds\r\nhares, as I thought them to be, and foxes: but they differed greatly\r\nfrom all the other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy myself to\r\neat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be venturous:\r\nfor I had no want of food, and of that which was very good too;\r\nespecially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or\r\ntortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall-Market could not\r\nhave furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and\r\nthough my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for\r\nthankfulness; as I was not driven to any extremities for food; but had\r\nrather plenty, even to dainties.\r\n\r\nI never travelled on this journey above two miles outright in a day, or\r\nthereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns, to see what\r\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I\r\nresolved to sit down for the night; and then I either reposed myself in\r\na tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the\r\nground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could\r\ncome at me without waking me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had\r\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island: for here indeed the\r\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas, on the other side,\r\nI had found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite\r\nnumber of fowls of many kinds; some of which I had seen, and some of\r\nwhich I had not seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such\r\nas I knew not the names of, except those called Penguins.\r\n\r\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my\r\npowder and shot; and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I\r\ncould, which I could better feed on. But though there were many goats\r\nhere, more than on my side the island, yet it was with much more\r\ndifficulty that I could come near them; the country being flat and even,\r\nand they saw me much sooner than when I was upon a hill.\r\n\r\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; yet I\r\nhad not the least inclination to remove; for as I was fixed in my\r\nhabitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was\r\nhere to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I\r\ntravelled along the sea-shore towards the east, I suppose about twelve\r\nmiles; and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I\r\nconcluded I would go home again; and that the next journey I took should\r\nbe on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round\r\ntill I came to my post again: of which in its place.\r\n\r\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could\r\neasily keep so much of the island in my view, that I could not miss my\r\nfirst dwelling by viewing the country: but I found myself mistaken; for\r\nbeing come about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a\r\nvery large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered\r\nwith wood, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but\r\nthat of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of\r\nthe sun at that time of the day. And it happened to my farther\r\nmisfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while I\r\nwas in this valley; and not being able to see the sun, I wandered about\r\nvery uncomfortable, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side,\r\nlook for my post, and come back the same way I went; and then by easy\r\njournies I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun,\r\nammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.\r\n\r\nIn this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and\r\nrunning to take hold of it, I caught it, and saved it alive from the\r\ndog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could; for I had often\r\nbeen musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so\r\nraise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and\r\nshot should be all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and\r\nwith a string which I had made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried\r\nabout me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to\r\nmy bower, and there I enclosed him and left him; for I was very\r\nimpatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above a month.\r\n\r\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\r\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey,\r\nwithout a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my\r\nown house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me,\r\ncompared to that; and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable,\r\nthat I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, while it\r\nshould be my lot to stay on the island.\r\n\r\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\r\njourney: during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty\r\naffair of making a cage for my Pol, who began now to be more domestic,\r\nand to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the\r\npoor kid which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to\r\nfetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly I went, and found it\r\nwhere I left it (for indeed it could not get out,) but was almost\r\nstarved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches\r\nof such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I\r\ntied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being\r\nhungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a\r\ndog: and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so\r\ngentle, and so fond, that it was from that time one of my domestics\r\nalso, and would never leave me afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the\r\n30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the\r\nanniversary of my landing on the island; having now been there two\r\nyears, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I came\r\nthere. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments for\r\nthe many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended\r\nwith, and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I\r\ngave humble and hearty thanks to God for having been pleased to discover\r\nto me, that it was possible I might be more happy even in this solitary\r\ncondition, than I should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in\r\nall the pleasures of the world: that he could fully make up to me the\r\ndeficiencies of my solitary state, and the wont of human society, by his\r\npresence, and the communications of his grace to my soul; supporting,\r\ncomforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and\r\nto hope for his eternal presence hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy the life I\r\nnow led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,\r\ncursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days: and now I\r\nchanged both my sorrows and my joys: my very desires altered, my\r\naffections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from\r\nwhat they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past.\r\n\r\nBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the\r\ncountry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me\r\non a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the\r\nwoods, the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner,\r\nlocked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an\r\nuninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest\r\ncomposures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and\r\nmake me wring my hands, and weep like a child: sometimes it would take\r\nme in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh,\r\nand look upon the ground for an hour or two together: this was still\r\nworse to me; but if I could burst into tears, or give vent to my\r\nfeelings by words, it would go off; and my grief being exhausted,\r\nwould abate.\r\n\r\nBut now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I daily read the\r\nword of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state. One\r\nmorning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, \"I will\r\nnever leave thee, nor forsake thee:\" immediately it occurred that these\r\nwords were to me; why else should they be directed in such a manner,\r\njust at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one\r\nforsaken of God and man? \"Well then,\" said I, \"if God does not forsake\r\nme, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the\r\nworld should forsake me; seeing on the other hand, if I had all the\r\nworld, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no\r\ncomparison in the loss?\"\r\n\r\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it was possible\r\nfor me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it\r\nwas probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in\r\nthe world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for\r\nbringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but something shocked\r\nmy mind at that thought and I durst not speak the words. \"How canst thou\r\nbe such a hypocrite,\" said I, even audibly, \"to pretend to be thankful\r\nfor a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented\r\nwith, thou wouldest rather pray heartily to be delivered from?\" Here I\r\nstopped: but though I could not say I thanked God for being here, yet I\r\nsincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting\r\nprovidences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my\r\nwickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my\r\nvery soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England,\r\nwithout any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods; and for\r\nassisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.\r\n\r\nThus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and though\r\nI have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of\r\nmy works this year as the first, yet in general it may be observed, that\r\nI was very seldom idle; but having regularly divided my time, according\r\nto the several daily employments that were before me; such as, first, My\r\nduty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set\r\napart some time for, thrice every day: secondly, Going abroad with my\r\ngun for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning, when\r\nit did not rain: thirdly, Ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what\r\nI had killed or catched for my supply: these took up great part of the\r\nday; also it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when\r\nthe sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to\r\nstir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I\r\ncould be supposed to work in; with this exception, that sometimes I\r\nchanged my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the\r\nmorning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nTo this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added the\r\nexceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of\r\ntools, want of help, and want of skill, every thing I did took up out of\r\nmy time: for example, I was full two and forty days making me a board\r\nfor a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with\r\ntheir tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same\r\ntree in half a day.\r\n\r\nMy case was this; it was a large tree which was to be cut down, because\r\nmy board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days cutting down,\r\nand two more in cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or\r\npiece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both\r\nthe sides of it into chips, till it was light enough to move; then I\r\nturned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board, from end\r\nto end; then turning that side downward, cut the other side, till I\r\nbrought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both\r\nsides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work;\r\nbut labour and patience carried me through that, and many other things:\r\nI only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my\r\ntime went away with so little work, viz. that what might be a little to\r\nbe done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a\r\nprodigious time to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with\r\npatience and labour I went through many things; and, indeed, every thing\r\nthat my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by\r\nwhat follows.\r\n\r\nI was now in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\r\nbarley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them was not\r\ngreat; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of\r\nhalf a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season: but\r\nnow my crop promised very well; when, on a sudden, I found I was in\r\ndanger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was\r\nscarce possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and wild\r\ncreatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade,\r\nlay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and ate it so close,\r\nthat it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.\r\n\r\nI saw no remedy for this, but by making an enclosure about it with a\r\nhedge, which I did with a great deal of toil; and the more, because it\r\nrequired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my\r\ncrop, I got it tolerably well fenced in about three weeks' time; and\r\nshooting some of the creatures in the day-time, I set my dog to guard it\r\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\r\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\r\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.\r\n\r\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so\r\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear: for\r\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\r\nsurrounded with fowls, I know not of how many sorts, who stood, as it\r\nwere, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them\r\n(for I always had my gun with me;) I had no sooner shot, but there rose\r\nup a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the\r\ncorn itself.\r\n\r\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would\r\ndevour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be able to\r\nraise a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, I\r\nresolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it\r\nnight and day. In the first place, I went among it, to see what damage\r\nwas already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that\r\nas it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great, but that\r\nthe remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could be saved.\r\n\r\nI staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see\r\nthe thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited\r\ntill I was gone away; and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked\r\noff, as if gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, than they dropt\r\ndown, one by one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could\r\nnot have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain\r\nthey eat now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the\r\nconsequence; so coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three\r\nof them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them\r\nas we serve notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged them in chains,\r\nfor a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine that this should\r\nhave such an effect as it had; for the fowls not only never came to the\r\ncorn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island, and I\r\ncould never see a bird near the place as long as my scare-crows hung\r\nthere. This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the latter\r\nend of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped\r\nmy corn.\r\n\r\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down: and all I\r\ncould do was to make one as well as I could, out of one of the broad\r\nswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship.\r\nHowever, as my first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to\r\ncut it down: in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the\r\nears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so\r\nrubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I\r\nfound that out of my half peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice,\r\nand above two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess,\r\nfor I had no measure.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was great encouragement to me; and I foresaw that, in\r\ntime, it would please God to supply me with bread; and yet here I was\r\nperplexed again; for I neither knew how to grind, or make meal of my\r\ncorn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal, how\r\nto make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake\r\nit: these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for\r\nstore, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of\r\nthis crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and,\r\nin the mean tune, to employ all my study and hours of working to\r\naccomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.\r\n\r\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is a little\r\nwonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon, viz.\r\nthe strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing,\r\nproducing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article\r\nof bread.\r\n\r\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily\r\ndiscouragement, and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after\r\nI had got the first handful of seed-corn which, as I have said, came up\r\nunexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade or shovel to dig\r\nit: well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I observed\r\nbefore; but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost\r\nme a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore\r\nout the sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it much\r\nworse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with\r\npatience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the corn\r\nwas sown, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag\r\na great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be\r\ncalled, rather than rake or harrow it. When it was growing and grown, I\r\nhave observed already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it,\r\nmow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff,\r\nand save it: then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast\r\nand salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and yet all\r\nthese things I did without, as shall be observed; and the corn was an\r\ninestimable comfort and advantage to me: all this, as I said, made every\r\nthing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no help for;\r\nneither was my time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a\r\ncertain part of it, was every day appointed to these works; and as I\r\nresolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity\r\nby me, I had the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and\r\ninvention, to furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all\r\nthe operations necessary for making corn fit for my use.\r\n\r\nBut now I was to prepare more land; for I had seed enough to sow above\r\nan acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to\r\nmake me a spade; which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed,\r\nand very heavy, and required double labour to work with it: however, I\r\nwent through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground,\r\nas near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in\r\nwith a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which\r\nI had set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in one year's time, I\r\nknew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but little\r\nrepair. This work took me up full three months; because a great part of\r\nthe time was in the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within\r\ndoors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found\r\nemployment on the following occasions; always observing, that while I\r\nwas at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching\r\nhim to speak; and I quickly learned him to know his own name, and at\r\nlast to speak it out pretty loud, Pol; which was the first word I ever\r\nheard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This, therefore, was\r\nnot my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I had a\r\ngreat employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long studied, by some\r\nmeans or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I\r\nwanted much, but knew not where to come at them: however, considering\r\nthe heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any\r\nclay, I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried in the sun,\r\nbe hard and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any thing that\r\nwas dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the\r\npreparing corn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to\r\nmake some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold\r\nwhat should be put into them.\r\n\r\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how\r\nmany awkward ways I took to raise this pastil; what odd, misshapen, ugly\r\nthings I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay\r\nnot being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the\r\nover violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many\r\nfell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were\r\ndried: and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the\r\nclay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could\r\nnot make above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars)\r\nin about two months' labour.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them\r\nvery gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets,\r\nwhich I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as\r\nbetween the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I\r\nstuffed it full of the rice and barley-straw; and these two pots being\r\nto stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the\r\nmeal, when the corn was bruised.\r\n\r\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made\r\nseveral smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,\r\nflat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to; and\r\nthe heat of the sun baked them very hard.\r\n\r\nBut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot to\r\nhold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of these could do. It\r\nhappened some time after, making a pretty large fire for cooking my\r\nmeat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a\r\nbroken piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the fire, burnt as\r\nhard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it;\r\nand said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if\r\nthey would burn broken.\r\n\r\nThis set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some\r\npots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of\r\nglazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I\r\nplaced three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon\r\nanother, and placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap of\r\nembers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside,\r\nand upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite\r\nthrough, and observed that they did not crack at all: when I saw them\r\nclear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I\r\nfound one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the\r\nsand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,\r\nand would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire\r\ngradually, till the pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching\r\nthem all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the\r\nmorning I had three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two\r\nother earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired; and one of them\r\nperfectly glazed with the running of the sand.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of\r\nearthen-ware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the shapes of them,\r\nthey were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, as I had no way of\r\nmaking them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make\r\npies that never learned to raise paste.\r\n\r\nNo joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I\r\nfound I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had\r\nhardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the\r\nfire again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did\r\nadmirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth;\r\nthough I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make\r\nit so good as I would have had it been.\r\n\r\nMy next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in;\r\nfor as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that perfection\r\nof art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was at a great\r\nloss; for, of all trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified\r\nfor a stonecutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any tools to go\r\nabout it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough\r\nto cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar; but could find none at all,\r\nexcept what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut\r\nout: nor, indeed, were the rocks in the island of sufficient hardness,\r\nas they were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear\r\nthe weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling\r\nit with sand: so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a\r\nstone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard\r\nwood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had\r\nstrength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe\r\nand hatchet; and then, with the help of fire, and infinite labour, made\r\na hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After\r\nthis, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called\r\niron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of\r\ncorn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn into\r\nmeal, to make my bread.\r\n\r\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve, or searce, to dress my meal,\r\nand to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see\r\nit possible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing,\r\neven but to think on; for I had nothing like the necessary thing to make\r\nit; I mean fine thin canvass or stuff, to searce the meal through. Here\r\nI was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do;\r\nlinen I had none left, but what was mere rags; I had goats'-hair, but\r\nneither knew how to weave it nor spin it; and had I known how, here were\r\nno tools to work it with: all the remedy I found for this was, at last\r\nrecollecting I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of\r\nthe ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin, with some pieces of these\r\nI made three small sieves, proper enough for the work; and thus I made\r\nshift for some years: how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place.\r\n\r\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\r\nmake bread when I came to have corn: for, first, I had no yeast: as to\r\nthat part there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself\r\nmuch about it; but for an oven I was indeed puzzled. At length I found\r\nout an expedient for that also, which was this; I made some earthen\r\nvessels, very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two feet\r\ndiameter, and not above nine inches deep: these I burned in the fire, as\r\nI had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I\r\nmade a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square\r\ntiles, of my own making and burning also; but I should not call\r\nthem square.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire-wood was burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them\r\nforward upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let them\r\nlie till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all the embers, I\r\nset down my loaf, or loaves, and covering them with the earthen pot,\r\ndrew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to\r\nthe heat; and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my\r\nbarley-loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-cook into the\r\nbargain; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but\r\nmade no pies, as I had nothing to put into them except the flesh of\r\nfowls or goats.\r\n\r\nIt need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up most part of\r\nthe third year of my abode here; for, it is to be observed, in the\r\nintervals of these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage:\r\nI reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I could,\r\nand laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub\r\nit out; for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash\r\nit with.\r\n\r\nAnd now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build\r\nmy barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for the increase of\r\nthe corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\r\nbushels, and of rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to\r\nbegin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while:\r\nI resolved also to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole\r\nyear, and to sow but once a year.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were\r\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\r\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\r\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.\r\n\r\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\r\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other\r\nside of the island; and I was not without some secret wishes that I was\r\non shore there; fancying, that seeing the main land, and an inhabited\r\ncountry, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and\r\nperhaps at last find some means of escape.\r\n\r\nBut all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a\r\ncondition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps\r\nsuch as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers\r\nof Africa; that if I once came in their power, I should run a hazard of\r\nmore than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;\r\nfor I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals,\r\nor man-eaters; and I knew, by the latitude, that I could not be far off\r\nfrom that shore. Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that they\r\nmight kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen into their\r\nhands, even when they have been ten or twenty together; much more I, who\r\nwas but one, and could makee little or no defence; all these things, I\r\nsay, which I ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in my\r\nthoughts afterwards, took up none of my apprehensions at first; yet my\r\nhead ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore.\r\n\r\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the\r\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on\r\nthe coast of Africa; but this was in vain: then I thought I would go and\r\nlook at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the\r\nshore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay\r\nnearly where she did at first, but not quite; having turned, by the\r\nforce of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high\r\nridge of beachy rough sand; but no water about her, as before. If I had\r\nhad hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the water,\r\nthe boat would have done very well, and I might have gone back into the\r\nBrazils with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen, that I could\r\nno more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could\r\nremove the island; however, I went to the woods, and cut levers and\r\nrollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do;\r\nsuggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, and repair the\r\ndamage she had received, she would be a very good boat, and I might\r\nventure to sea in her.\r\n\r\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I\r\nthink, three or four weeks about it: at last, finding it impossible to\r\nheave her up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,\r\nto undermine her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of\r\nwood to thrust and guide her right in the fall.\r\n\r\nBut when I had done this, I was unable to stir her up again, or to get\r\nunder her, much less to move her forward towards the water; so I was\r\nforced to give it over: and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the\r\nboat, my desire to venture over the main increased, rather than\r\ndiminished, as the means for it seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nAt length, I began to think whether it was not possible to make myself a\r\ncanoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even\r\nwithout tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a\r\ngreat tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased\r\nmyself extremely with the idea of making it, and with my having much\r\nmore convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at\r\nall considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more\r\nthan the Indians did, viz. the want of hands to move it into the water\r\nwhen it was made, a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all\r\nthe consequences of want of tools could be to them: for what could it\r\navail me, if, after I had chosen my tree, and with much trouble cut it\r\ndown, and might be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into\r\nthe proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it\r\nhollow, so as to make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it\r\njust where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the water?\r\n\r\nOne would imagine, if I had had the least reflection upon my mind of my\r\ncircumstances while I was making this boat, I should have immediately\r\nthought how I was to get it into the sea: but my thoughts were so intent\r\nupon my voyage in it, that I never once considered how I should get it\r\noff the land; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me to\r\nguide it over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty-five fathoms of\r\nland, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.\r\n\r\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did,\r\nwho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,\r\nwithout determining whether I was able to undertake it; not but that the\r\ndifficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a\r\nstop to my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer: Let me first\r\nmake it; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when\r\nit is done.\r\n\r\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\r\nprevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree, and I question\r\nmuch whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\r\nat Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part\r\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of\r\ntwenty-two feet, where it lessened, and then parted into branches. It\r\nwas not without infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty\r\ndays hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen more getting the\r\nbranches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it, cut off: after\r\nthis, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to\r\nsomething like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it\r\nought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and\r\nwork it out so as to make an exact boat of it: this I did, indeed,\r\nwithout fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,\r\ntill I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to\r\nhave carried six and twenty men, and consequently big enough to have\r\ncarried me and all my cargo.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it.\r\nThe boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua,\r\nthat was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost,\r\nyou may be sure; and there remained nothing but to get it into the\r\nwater; which, had I accomplished, I make no question but I should have\r\nbegun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that\r\never was undertaken.\r\n\r\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost\r\nme inexpressible labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the\r\nwater, and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill\r\ntowards the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to\r\ndig into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I\r\nbegun, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains; (but who grudge pains\r\nthat have their deliverance in view?) when this was worked through, and\r\nthis difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more\r\nstir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the distance\r\nof ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to\r\nthe canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I\r\nbegan this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how\r\ndeep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I\r\nfound by the number of hands I had, having none but my own, that it must\r\nhave been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through with it;\r\nfor the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at\r\nleast twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with great reluctancy, I\r\nwas at length obliged to give over also.\r\n\r\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\r\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly\r\nof our own strength to go through with it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in this place, and\r\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\r\nbefore; for, by a constant study and serious application to the word of\r\nGod, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a different knowledge\r\nfrom what I had before; I entertained different notions of things; I\r\nlooked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do\r\nwith, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, I\r\nhad nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have; I thought it\r\nlooked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as, a place I had\r\nlived in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as father\r\nAbraham to Dives, \"Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I was here removed from all the wickedness of the\r\nworld; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the\r\npride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now\r\ncapable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I\r\nmight call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had\r\npossession of; there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to\r\ndispute sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised\r\nship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow\r\nas I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough,\r\nbut now and then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber\r\nenough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have\r\nmade wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when\r\nit had been built.\r\n\r\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to\r\neat and supply my wants, and what was the rest to me? If I killed more\r\nflesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more\r\ncorn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down\r\nwere lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than\r\nfor fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dress my food.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just\r\nreflection, that all the good things of this world, are of no farther\r\ngood to us than for our use; and that whatever we may heap up to give\r\nothers, we enjoy only as much as we can use, and no more. The most\r\ncovetous griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of\r\ncovetousness, if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more\r\nthan I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire, except it was for\r\nthings which I had not, and they were comparatively but trifles, though\r\nindeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money,\r\nas well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there\r\nthe nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay: I had no manner of business for\r\nit; and I often thought within myself, that I would have given a handful\r\nof it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn;\r\nnay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot\r\nseed from England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of\r\nink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it;\r\nbut there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave\r\nin the wet seasons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had\r\nbeen the same case,--they had been of no manner of value to me because\r\nof no use.\r\n\r\nI had now brought my state of life to be much more comfortable in itself\r\nthan it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body.\r\nI frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of\r\nGod's providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness: I\r\nlearned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon\r\nthe dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what I\r\nwanted: and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot\r\nexpress them; and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented\r\npeople in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given\r\nthem, because they see and covet something that he has not given them.\r\nAll our discontents about what we want, appeared to me to spring from\r\nthe want of thankfulness for what we have.\r\n\r\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\r\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,\r\nto compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would\r\nbe; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence\r\nof God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up near to the\r\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got\r\nout of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I had\r\nwanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot\r\nfor getting my food.\r\n\r\nI spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in\r\nthe most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out\r\nof the ship. I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and\r\nturtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must\r\nhave perished; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a\r\nmere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance,\r\nI had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the\r\nbowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it\r\nwith my claws, like a beast.\r\n\r\nThese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to\r\nme, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships\r\nand misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend to the\r\nreflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, Is any\r\naffliction like mine? Let them consider how much worse the cases of some\r\npeople are, and their case might have been, if Providence had\r\nthought fit.\r\n\r\nI had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with\r\nhopes; and this was comparing my present condition with what I had\r\ndeserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of\r\nProvidence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the\r\nknowledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed by my father and\r\nmother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their endeavours to\r\ninfuse an early religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty,\r\nand what the nature and end of my being required of me. But, alas!\r\nfalling early into the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most\r\ndestitute of the fear of God, though his terrors are always before them;\r\nI say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring\r\ncompany, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained was\r\nlaughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers,\r\nand the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by my long absence\r\nfrom all manner of opportunities to converse with any thing but what was\r\nlike myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or tending towards it.\r\n\r\nSo void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least sense of\r\nwhat I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed\r\n(such as my escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese\r\nmaster of a ship, my being planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving\r\nthe cargo from England, and the like,) I never had once the words, Thank\r\nGod, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress\r\nhad I so much as a thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, Lord,\r\nhave mercy upon me! no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to\r\nswear by, and blaspheme it.\r\n\r\nI had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have\r\nalready observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and\r\nwhen I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had\r\nattended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt\r\nbountifully with me,--had not only punished me less than my iniquity had\r\ndeserved, but had so plentifully provided for me,--this gave me great\r\nhopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercies in\r\nstore for me.\r\n\r\nWith these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation\r\nto the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but\r\neven to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet\r\na living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment\r\nof my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have\r\nexpected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at my\r\ncondition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily\r\nbread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I\r\nought to consider I had been fed by a miracle, even as great as that of\r\nfeeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles: and that I\r\ncould hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world\r\nwhere I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I\r\nhad no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no\r\nravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no\r\nvenomous or poisonous creatures which I might feed on to my hurt; no\r\nsavages to murder and devour me. In a word, as my life was a life of\r\nsorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing\r\nto make it a life of comfort, but to make myself sensible of God's\r\ngoodness to me, and care over me in this condition; and after I did make\r\na just improvement of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.\r\n\r\nI had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on shore\r\nfor my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.\r\n\r\nMy ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but a very\r\nlittle, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was\r\nso pale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long\r\nas it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on\r\nwhich any remarkable thing happened to me: and, first, by casting up\r\ntimes past, I remember that there was a strange concurrence of days in\r\nthe various providences which befel me, and which, if I had been\r\nsuperstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might\r\nhave had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away from my\r\nfather and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the\r\nsame day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and made a\r\nslave: the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of the\r\nship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape\r\nfrom Sallee in the boat: and the same day of the year I was born on,\r\nviz. the 30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously\r\nsaved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island:\r\nso that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on one day.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I mean the\r\nbiscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the\r\nlast degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a\r\nyear; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got any\r\ncorn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at\r\nall, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\nMy clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had none for a\r\ngreat while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of\r\nthe other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I\r\ncould bear no clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me\r\nthat I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen\r\nof shirts. There were also, indeed, several thick watch-coats of the\r\nseamen's which were left, but they were too hot to wear: and though it\r\nis true that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of\r\nclothes, yet I could not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined\r\nto it, which I was not, nor could I abide the thought of it, though, I\r\nwas all alone. The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could\r\nnot bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some\r\nclothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin: whereas,\r\nwith a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling under\r\nthe shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more could I ever\r\nbring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or hat; the\r\nheat of the sun beating with such violence as it does in that place,\r\nwould give me the head-ach presently, by darting so directly upon my\r\nhead, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if\r\nI put on my hat, it would presently go away.\r\n\r\nUpon these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,\r\nwhich I called clothes, into some order: I had worn out all the\r\nwaistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make\r\njackets out of the great watch-coats that I had by me, and with such\r\nother materials as I had; so I set to work a tailoring, or rather,\r\nindeed; a botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made\r\nshift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me\r\na great while: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift\r\nindeed till afterwards.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I\r\nkilled, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them up, stretched out\r\nwith sticks, in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and\r\nhard that they were fit for little, but others I found very useful. The\r\nfirst thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair\r\non the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well,\r\nthat after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of the skins, that is\r\nto say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose; for\r\nthey were rather wanting to keep me cool than warm. I must not omit to\r\nacknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad\r\ncarpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I made very\r\ngood shift with; and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair\r\nof my waistcoat and cap being uppermost, I was kept very dry.\r\n\r\nAfter this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me an\r\numbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to\r\nmake one; I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they were very\r\nuseful in the great heats which are there; and I felt the heats every\r\njot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox: besides,\r\nas I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as\r\nwell for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was\r\na great while before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I\r\nthought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to\r\nmy mind; but at last I made one that answered indifferently well; the\r\nmain difficulty I found was to make it to let down: I could make it\r\nspread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable\r\nfor me any way but just over my head, which would not do. However, at\r\nlast, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the\r\nhair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept\r\noff the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the\r\nweather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest; and\r\nwhen I had no need of it, could close it, and carry it under my arm.\r\n\r\nThus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by\r\nresigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the\r\ndisposal of his providence. This made my life better than sociable; for\r\nwhen I began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself,\r\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I\r\nmay say, with even God himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the\r\nutmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\r\n\r\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\r\nhappened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\r\nand place, just as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides\r\nmy yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins,\r\nof both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of\r\none year's provision beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and\r\nmy daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make me\r\na canoe, which at last I finished: so that by digging a canal to it of\r\nsix feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost\r\nhalf a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it\r\nwithout considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able\r\nto launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or bring\r\nthe water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a\r\nmemorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next time,\r\nthough I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I\r\ncould not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said,\r\nnear half a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave\r\nit over: and though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged\r\nmy labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.\r\n\r\nHowever, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was\r\nnot at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the\r\nfirst; I mean, of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was\r\nabove forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted\r\nto put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had\r\na boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I\r\nhad been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already\r\ndescribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little\r\njourney made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I\r\nhad a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, that I might do every thing with discretion and\r\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail to\r\nit out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and\r\nof which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail, and\r\ntried the boat, I found she would sail very well: then I made little\r\nlockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put provisions,\r\nnecessaries, ammunition, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain or\r\nthe spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside\r\nof the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over\r\nit, to keep it dry.\r\n\r\nI fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to stand\r\nover my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and\r\nthus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never\r\nwent far out, nor far from the little creek. At last, being eager to\r\nview the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise;\r\nand accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two\r\ndozen of loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley bread, an\r\nearthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great deal of,) a\r\nlittle bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more,\r\nand two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had\r\nsaved out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the\r\nother to cover me in the night.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my\r\ncaptivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found\r\nit much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not\r\nvery large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great\r\nledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water,\r\nsome under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league\r\nmore, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nWhen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,\r\nand come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to\r\nsea, and, above all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came to\r\nan anchor; for I had made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of a\r\nbroken grappling which I got out of the ship.\r\n\r\nHaving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up on\r\na hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent\r\nof it, and resolved to venture.\r\n\r\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a\r\nstrong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and\r\neven came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it, because\r\nI saw there might be some danger, that when I came into it, I might be\r\ncarried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the\r\nisland again: and, indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe\r\nit would have been so; for there was the same current on the other side\r\nthe island, only that it set off at a farther distance, and I saw there\r\nwas a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out\r\nof the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.\r\n\r\nI lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at\r\nE.S.E. and that being just contrary to the said current, made a great\r\nbreach of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep\r\ntoo close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off because of\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over-night, the\r\nsea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning piece again to all\r\nrash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I\r\nwas not even my boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a\r\ngreat depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it\r\ncarried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I could do\r\ncould not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried\r\nme farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand.\r\nThere was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my\r\npaddles signified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost;\r\nfor as the current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few\r\nleagues distance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably\r\ngone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no\r\nprospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm\r\nenough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the\r\nshore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat;\r\nand I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen\r\npots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,\r\nto be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand\r\nleagues at least?\r\n\r\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even the\r\nmost miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon my\r\ndesolate solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the world; and\r\nall the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again. I\r\nstretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes: \"O happy desert!\" said\r\nI, \"I shall never see thee more. O miserable creature! whither am I\r\ngoing!\" Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and how I\r\nhad repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be on\r\nshore there again! Thus we never see the true state of our condition\r\ntill it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value\r\nwhat we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine\r\nthe consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for\r\nso it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,\r\nand in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, I worked\r\nhard, till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as\r\nmuch to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current which\r\nthe eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed\r\nthe meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,\r\nspringing up from S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially\r\nwhen, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this\r\ntime I was got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the\r\nleast cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way\r\ntoo; for I had no compass on board, and should never have known how to\r\nhave steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but\r\nthe weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again,\r\nand spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to\r\nget out of the current.\r\n\r\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,\r\nI saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current\r\nwas near; for where the current was so strong, the water was foul; but\r\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I\r\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\r\nrocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the\r\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\r\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made\r\na strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very\r\nsharp stream.\r\n\r\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\r\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who\r\nhave been in such-like extremities, may guess what my present surprise\r\nof joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;\r\nand the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running\r\ncheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.\r\n\r\nThis eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, directly\r\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the\r\ncurrent which carried me away at first: so that when I came near the\r\nisland, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,\r\nthe other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.\r\n\r\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this\r\ncurrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther.\r\nHowever, I found that being between two great currents, viz. that on the\r\nsouth side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay\r\nabout a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake\r\nof the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way; and\r\nhaving still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly\r\nfor the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of the\r\nisland, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster,\r\nstretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting\r\noff the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the\r\nnorth, and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my\r\ncourse lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However, having a\r\nfresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west: and, in\r\nabout an hour, came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being\r\nsmooth water, I soon got to land.\r\n\r\nWhen I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my\r\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my\r\nboat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat\r\nclose to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees,\r\nand laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue\r\nof the voyage.\r\n\r\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat: I had run\r\nso much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it\r\nby the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the\r\nwest side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I\r\nonly resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the shore,\r\nand to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in\r\nsafety, so as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles,\r\nor thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay,\r\nabout a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet\r\nor brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where\r\nshe lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her.\r\nHere I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore, to\r\nlook about me, and see where I was.\r\n\r\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\r\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of\r\nmy boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my\r\nmarch. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been\r\nupon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found every\r\nthing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being,\r\nas I said before, my country house.\r\n\r\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade, to rest my limbs,\r\nfor I was very weary, and fell asleep: but judge you, if you can, that\r\nread my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was awaked out of my\r\nsleep by a voice, calling me by my name several times, \"Robin, Robin,\r\nRobin Crusoe; poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are\r\nyou? Where have you been!\"\r\n\r\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling,\r\nas it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking the latter\r\npart, that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping and\r\nwaking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice\r\ncontinued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake\r\nmore perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up\r\nin the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw\r\nmy Pol sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew it was he\r\nthat spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk\r\nto him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would\r\nsit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, \"Poor\r\nRobin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been? How came you here?\"\r\nand such things as I had taught him.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could\r\nbe nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.\r\nFirst, I was amazed how the creature got thither, and then, how he\r\nshould just keep about the place, and no where else: but as I was well\r\nsatisfied it could be nobody but honest Pol, I got over it; and holding\r\nout my hand, and calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable creature\r\ncame to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do and continued\r\ntalking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and where had\r\nI been? just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again: and so I\r\ncarried him home along with me.\r\n\r\nI now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough to do\r\nfor many days, to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in.\r\nI would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the\r\nisland; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to the\r\neast side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough\r\nthere was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my very\r\nblood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the\r\nisland, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the current\r\nran with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it\r\non the other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the stream,\r\nand carried by the island, as I had been before of being carried away\r\nfrom it; so, with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any\r\nboat, though it had been the product of so many months' labour to make\r\nit, and of so many more to get it into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year, lived a very\r\nsedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being\r\nvery much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning\r\nmyself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very\r\nhappily in all things, except that of society.\r\n\r\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\r\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I could, upon\r\noccasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how\r\nfew tools I had.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen-ware,\r\nand contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found\r\ninfinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shapable,\r\nwhich before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was\r\nnever more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for any thing I\r\nfound out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it\r\nwas a very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red, like\r\nother earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the\r\nsmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used\r\nto smoke: and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first,\r\nnot thinking that there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when\r\nI searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.\r\n\r\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\r\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome,\r\nyet they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying\r\nthings up in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat\r\nabroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in\r\npieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle: I could\r\ncut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was\r\nenough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest\r\nbehind me. Also large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which\r\nI always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in\r\ngreat baskets.\r\n\r\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want\r\nwhich it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\r\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\r\nsay, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as is observed, in the\r\nthird year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and\r\nI was in hopes of getting a he-goat: but I could not by any means bring\r\nit to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in\r\nmy heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.\r\n\r\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,\r\nmy ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and\r\nsnare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive;\r\nand particularly, I wanted a she-goat great with young. For this\r\npurpose, I made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more\r\nthan once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,\r\nand I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length I\r\nresolved to try a pitfall: so I dug several large pits in the earth, in\r\nplaces where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits\r\nI placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight upon them;\r\nand several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the\r\ntrap; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten\r\nup the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set\r\nthree traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all\r\nstanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.\r\nHowever, I altered my traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars,\r\ngoing one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large old\r\nhe-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.\r\n\r\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce, I\r\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring\r\nhim away alive, which was what I wanted: I could have killed him, but\r\nthat was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him\r\nout, and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But\r\nI did not then know what I afterwards learnt, that hunger will tame a\r\nlion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without food, and\r\nthen have carried him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he\r\nwould have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty\r\nsagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:\r\nthen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\r\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\r\n\r\nIt was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some sweet\r\ncorn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found that\r\nif I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when I had no powder or\r\nshot left, breeding some up tame was my only way; when, perhaps, I might\r\nhave them about my house like a flock of sheep. But then it occurred to\r\nme, that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always\r\nrun wild when they grew up: and the only way for this was, to have some\r\nenclosed piece of ground, well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to\r\nkeep them in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or\r\nthose without break in.\r\n\r\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I saw there\r\nwas an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a\r\nproper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them\r\nto eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\r\n\r\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\r\ncontrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these\r\n(being a plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people\r\ncall it in the western colonies,) which had two or three little drills\r\nof fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will\r\nsmile at my forecast, when I shall tell them, I began my enclosing this\r\npiece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been\r\nat least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the\r\ncompass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough\r\nto do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so\r\nmuch compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have so\r\nmuch room to chase them in, that I should never catch them.\r\n\r\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty yards, when\r\nthis thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the\r\nfirst beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about 150 yards in\r\nlength, and 100 yards in breadth; which, as it would maintain as many as\r\nI should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could\r\nadd more ground to my enclosure.\r\n\r\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I\r\nwas about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done\r\nit, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to\r\nfeed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I\r\nwould go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and\r\nfeed them out of my hand: so that after my enclosure was finished, and I\r\nlet them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for\r\na handful of corn.\r\n\r\nThis answered my end; and in about a year and a half I had a flock of\r\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more, I had three and\r\nforty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. After that I\r\nenclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens\r\nto drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece\r\nof ground into another.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on\r\nwhen I pleased, but milk too; a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I\r\ndid not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,\r\nwas really an agreeable surprise: for now I set up my dairy, and had\r\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives\r\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\r\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\r\nbutter or cheese made, only when I was a boy, after a great many essays\r\nand miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last, and also salt\r\n(though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon\r\nsome of the rocks of the sea,) and never wanted it afterwards. How\r\nmercifully can our Creator treat his creatures, even in those conditions\r\nin which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he\r\nsweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise him for\r\ndungeons and prisons! What a table was here spread for me in a\r\nwilderness, where I saw nothing, at first, but to perish for hunger!\r\n\r\nIt would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little family\r\nsit down to dinner: there was my majesty, the prince and lord of the\r\nwhole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command;\r\nI could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away; and no rebels among\r\nall my subjects. Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone,\r\nattended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my favourite, was the\r\nonly person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown very old\r\nand crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat\r\nalways at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and\r\none on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark\r\nof special favour.\r\n\r\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for\r\nthey were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by\r\nmy own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind\r\nof creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the rest\r\nrun wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for\r\nthey would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I\r\nwas obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they\r\nleft me.--With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived;\r\nneither could I be said to want any thing but society: and of that, some\r\ntime after this, I was like to have too much.\r\n\r\nI was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my\r\nboat, though very loth to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes\r\nI sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times I\r\nsat myself down contented enough without her. But I had a strange\r\nuneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as I\r\nhave said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore\r\nlay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to do: this\r\ninclination increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to\r\ntravel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so; but\r\nhad any one in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must either\r\nhave frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter: and as I\r\nfrequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the\r\nnotion of my travelling through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in\r\nsuch a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:\r\n\r\nI had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap\r\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the\r\nrain off from running into my neck: nothing being so hurtful in these\r\nclimates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes.\r\n\r\nI had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about the\r\nmiddle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the\r\nbreeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down\r\nsuch a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the\r\nmiddle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a\r\npair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to\r\nflap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes: but of a\r\nmost barbarous shape, as inded were all the rest of my clothes.\r\n\r\nI had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with\r\ntwo thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on\r\neither side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw\r\nand a hatchet; one on one side, and one on the other. I had another\r\nbelt, not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my\r\nshoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,\r\nboth made of goat's skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the\r\nother my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my\r\ngun; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, but\r\nwhich, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, next to\r\nmy gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like\r\nas one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living\r\nwithin nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered\r\nto grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both\r\nscissars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what\r\ngrew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan\r\nwhiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the Moors\r\ndid not wear such, though the Turks did: of these mustachios or\r\nwhiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them,\r\nbut they were of a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in\r\nEngland, would have passed for frightful.\r\n\r\nBut all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to\r\nobserve me that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no more to\r\nthat part. In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out\r\nfive or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the\r\nplace where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks;\r\nand having no boat now to take care of, I went over the land, a nearer\r\nway, to the same height that I was upon before; when looking forward to\r\nthe point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double\r\nwith my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all\r\nsmooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there\r\nthan in any other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this,\r\nand resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing\r\nfrom the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently\r\nconvinced how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west,\r\nand joining with the current of waters, from some great river on the\r\nshore, must be the occasion of this current; and that according as the\r\nwind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the north, this current\r\ncame nearer, or went farther from the shore; for waiting thereabouts\r\ntill evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb\r\nbeing made, I plainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran\r\nfarther off, being near half a league from the shore; whereas in my\r\ncase, it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along\r\nwith it; which, at another time, it would not have done.\r\n\r\nThis observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but to observe\r\nthe ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my\r\nboat about the island again: but when I began to think of putting it in\r\npractice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the\r\ndanger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any\r\npatience; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was\r\nmore safe, though more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or\r\nrather make me another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side\r\nof the island, and one for the other.\r\n\r\nYou are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\r\nin the island; one, my little fortification or tent, with the wall about\r\nit, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, I had\r\nenlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. One of\r\nthese, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my\r\nwall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to\r\nthe rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of which I have\r\ngiven an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which\r\nwould hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of\r\nprovision, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the\r\nstraw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.\r\n\r\nAs for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\r\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\r\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one's view,\r\nof any habitation behind them.\r\n\r\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\r\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly\r\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\r\nseason: and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\r\nadjoining as fit as that.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I had my country seat; and I had now a tolerable\r\nplantation there also: for, first, I had my little bower, as I called\r\nit, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which\r\nencircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder\r\nstanding always in the inside: I kept the trees, which at first were no\r\nmore than my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut\r\nso, that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more\r\nagreeable shade; which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle of\r\nthis I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over\r\npoles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or\r\nrenewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins\r\nof the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things; and a blanket\r\nlaid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved,\r\nand a great watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to\r\nbe absent from my chief seat, I took up my country habitation.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my\r\ngoats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\r\nenclose this ground, I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the\r\ngoats should break through, that I never left off, till, with infinite\r\nlabour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,\r\nand so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and\r\nthere was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which\r\nafterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy\r\nseason, made the enclosure strong like a wall,--indeed, stronger\r\nthan any wall.\r\n\r\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains\r\nto bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support;\r\nfor I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my\r\nhand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for\r\nme as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and\r\nthat keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my\r\nenclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them\r\ntogether; which, by this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that\r\nwhen these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very\r\nthick, that I was forced to pull some of them up again.\r\n\r\nIn this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended\r\non for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve\r\nvery carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet:\r\nand indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome,\r\nnourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\r\n\r\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the\r\nplace where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my\r\nway thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all\r\nthings about, or belonging to her, in very good order: sometimes I went\r\nout in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,\r\nnor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so\r\napprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents\r\nor winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was\r\nexceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore,\r\nwhich was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one\r\nthunder-struck, or as if I had seen an apparition; I listened, I looked\r\nround me, but I could hear nothing, nor see any thing; I went up to a\r\nrising ground, to look farther; I went up the shore, and down the shore,\r\nbut it was all one; I could see no other impression but that one. I went\r\nto it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might\r\nnot be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was exactly\r\nthe print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came\r\nthither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but, after\r\ninnumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out\r\nof myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the\r\nground I went on, but terrified to the last degree: looking behind me at\r\nevery two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying\r\nevery stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to describe\r\nhow many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented things to\r\nme in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what\r\nstrange unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this,) I\r\nfled into it like one pursued; whether I went over by the ladder, as\r\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called\r\na door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning;\r\nfor never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more\r\nterror of mind than I to this retreat.\r\n\r\nI slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my\r\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is something contrary\r\nto the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of\r\nall creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful\r\nideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to\r\nmyself, even though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it\r\nmust be the Devil, and reason joined in with me upon this supposition;\r\nfor how should any other thing in human shape come into the place? Where\r\nwas the vessel that brought them? What marks were there of any other\r\nfootsteps? And how was it possible a man should come there? But then to\r\nthink that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where\r\nthere could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of\r\nhis foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not\r\nbe sure I should see it,--this was an amusement the other way. I\r\nconsidered that the Devil might have found out abundance of other ways\r\nto have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot; that as I\r\nlived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have been so\r\nsimple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one\r\nwhether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the\r\nfirst surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely:\r\nall this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the\r\nnotions we usually entertain of the subtilty of the Devil.\r\n\r\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\r\napprehensions of its being the Devil; and I presently concluded then,\r\nthat it must be some more dangerous creature, viz. that it must be some\r\nof the savages of the main land over against me, who had wandered out to\r\nsea in their canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary\r\nwinds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away\r\nagain to sea; being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate\r\nisland as I would have been to have had them.\r\n\r\nWhile these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very thankful\r\nin my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that\r\ntime, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would have\r\nconcluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have\r\nsearched farther for me: then terrible thoughts racked my imagination\r\nabout their having found my boat, and that there were people here; and\r\nthat if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers,\r\nand devour me; that if it should happen so that they should not find me,\r\nyet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away\r\nall my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\r\n\r\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence\r\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had of\r\nhis goodness, as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not\r\npreserve, by his power, the provision which he had made for me by his\r\ngoodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any\r\nmore corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if\r\nno accident would intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was\r\nupon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved\r\nfor the future to have two or three years' corn beforehand; so that\r\nwhatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.\r\n\r\nHow strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by what\r\nsecret different springs are the affections hurried about, as different\r\ncircumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day we\r\nseek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear,\r\nnay, even tremble at the apprehensions of; this was exemplified in me,\r\nat this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only\r\naffliction was that I seemed banished from human society, that I was\r\nalone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and\r\ncondemned to what I called silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven\r\nthought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among\r\nthe rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own species would\r\nhave seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest\r\nblessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,\r\ncould bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions\r\nof seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow\r\nor silent appearance of a man's having set his foot in the island.\r\n\r\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\r\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\r\nsurprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely\r\nwise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could\r\nnot foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I\r\nwas not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an\r\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\r\nhe thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended him, had\r\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought\r\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear his indignation, because\r\nI had sinned against him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not\r\nonly righteous, but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and\r\nafflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit\r\nto do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and\r\nentirely to his will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to\r\nhope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and\r\ndirections of his daily providence.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weeks and\r\nmonths; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I\r\ncannot omit: One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with\r\nthoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it\r\ndiscomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came\r\ninto my thoughts, \"Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will\r\ndeliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\" Upon this, rising cheerfully\r\nout of my bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and\r\nencouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done\r\npraying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words\r\nthat presented to me were, \"Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and\r\nhe shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.\" It is\r\nimpossible to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully\r\nlaid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\r\ncame into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of\r\nmy own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I\r\ncame on shore from my boat: this cheered me up a little too, and I began\r\nto persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but\r\nmy own foot: and why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as\r\nI was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I could\r\nby no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where I had not;\r\nand that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had\r\nplayed the part of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and\r\napparitions, and then are frightened at them more than any body.\r\n\r\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\r\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\r\nstarve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but some\r\nbarley-cakes and water: then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked\r\ntoo, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were\r\nin great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost\r\nspoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging\r\nmyself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print\r\nof one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own\r\nshadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country-house to milk\r\nmy flock: but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked\r\nbehind me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket,\r\nand run for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was\r\nhaunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly\r\nfrightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, as I went down thus two or\r\nthree days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and\r\nto think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but I\r\ncould not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the\r\nshore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and\r\nsee if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it\r\nwas my own foot: but when I came to the place, first, it appeared\r\nevidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on\r\nshore any where thereabouts: secondly, when I came to measure the mark\r\nwith my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both\r\nthese things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the\r\nvapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one\r\nin an ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man\r\nor men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was\r\ninhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and what course\r\nto take for my security I knew not.\r\n\r\nO what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It\r\ndeprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their\r\nrelief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my\r\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the\r\nenemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the\r\nsame or the like booty: then to the simple thing of digging up my two\r\ncorn fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be\r\nprompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent,\r\nthat they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to\r\nlook farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.\r\n\r\nThese were the subject of the first night's cogitataions after I was\r\ncome home again, while the apprehensions which had so over-run my mind\r\nwere fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. Thus fear\r\nof danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when\r\napparent to the eyes; and we find the burthen of anxiety greater, by\r\nmuch, than the evil which we are anxious about: and, which was worse\r\nthan all this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the\r\nresignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I\r\nthought, like Saul, who complained not, only that the Philistines were\r\nupon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways\r\nto compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon\r\nhis providence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance;\r\nwhich, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported\r\nunder this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the\r\nmorning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as\r\nit were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and\r\nwaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began\r\nto think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded\r\nthat this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no\r\nfarther from the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely\r\nabandoned as I might imagine; that although there were no stated\r\ninhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come\r\nboats off from the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but\r\nwhen they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place; that I\r\nhad lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow\r\nor figure of any people yet; and that if at any time they should be\r\ndriven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they\r\ncould, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion;\r\nthat the most I could suggest any danger from, was from any casual\r\naccidental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was\r\nlikely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills, so\r\nthey made no stay here, but went off again with all possible speed;\r\nseldom staying one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of\r\nthe tides and daylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to\r\ndo but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any\r\nsavages land upon the spot.\r\n\r\nNow I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring\r\na door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my\r\nfortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this,\r\ntherefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same\r\nmanner of a semi-circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had\r\nplanted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made\r\nmention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted\r\nbut few piles to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and\r\nstronger, and my wall would be soon finished: so that I had now a double\r\nwall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,\r\nand every thing I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven\r\nlittle holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside\r\nof this, I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually\r\nbringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall,\r\nand walking upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant\r\nthe muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of\r\nthe ship; these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames,\r\nthat held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns\r\nin two minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month in finishing,\r\nand yet never thought myself safe till it was done.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\r\nlength every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like\r\nwood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch,\r\nthat I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a\r\npretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have room to\r\nsee an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if\r\nthey attempted to approach my outer wall.\r\n\r\nThus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and in five or six years'\r\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and\r\nstrong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no men, of what\r\nkind soever, would ever imagine that there was any thing beyond it, much\r\nless a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in\r\nand out (for I left no avenue,) it was by setting two ladders, one to a\r\npart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to\r\nplace another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down,\r\nno man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and\r\nif they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\r\n\r\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\r\npreservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not\r\naltogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time\r\nmore than my mere fear suggested to me.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs;\r\nfor I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats; they were\r\nnot only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be\r\nsufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also\r\nwithout the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loth to\r\nlose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two\r\nways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig\r\na cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night; and the\r\nother was, to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one\r\nanother, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half\r\na dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to\r\nthe flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little\r\ntrouble and time: and this, though it would require a great deal of time\r\nand labour, I thought was the most rational design.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the\r\nisland; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my\r\nheart could wish for: it was a little damp piece of ground, in the\r\nmiddle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost\r\nlost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that way from the\r\neastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near\r\nthree acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure\r\nby nature; at least, it did not want near so much labour to make it so\r\nas the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.\r\n\r\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in less than a\r\nmonth's time I had so fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, call it\r\nwhich you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be\r\nsupposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any farther\r\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece;\r\nand when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had\r\nmade it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure,\r\nand it took me up more time by a great deal. All this labour I was at\r\nthe expense of, purely from my apprehensions on the account of the print\r\nof a man's foot which I had seen; for, as yet, I never saw any human\r\ncreature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this\r\nuneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it\r\nwas before, as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live\r\nin the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with\r\ngrief too, that the discomposure of my mind had too great impressions\r\nalso upon the religious part of my thoughts: for the dread and terror of\r\nfalling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits,\r\nthat I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker,\r\nat least not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I\r\nwas wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and\r\npressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night\r\nof being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify from\r\nmy experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and\r\naffection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror\r\nand discomposure; and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man\r\nis no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to\r\nGod, than he is for a repentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures\r\naffect the mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the\r\nmind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and\r\nmuch greater; praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\nBut to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little living\r\nstock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private\r\nplace to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west\r\npoint of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I\r\nthought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a\r\nperspective-glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved\r\nout of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote, that\r\nI could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes\r\nwere not able to hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not,\r\nI do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of\r\nit; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out without a\r\nperspective-glass in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end\r\nof the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently\r\nconvinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a\r\nstrange thing in the island as I imagined: and, but that it was a\r\nspecial providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the\r\nsavages never came, I should easily have known that nothing was more\r\nfrequent than for the canoes from the main, when they happened to be a\r\nlittle too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for\r\nharbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the\r\nvictors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this\r\nshore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals,\r\nthey would kill and eat them; of which hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the\r\nS.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is\r\nit possible for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore\r\nspread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and\r\nparticularly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a\r\ncircle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where I supposed the savage\r\nwretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of\r\ntheir fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained\r\nno notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my\r\napprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,\r\nhellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,\r\nwhich, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of\r\nbefore: in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my\r\nstomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature\r\ndischarged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with\r\nuncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay\r\nin the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with all the speed\r\nI could, and walked on towards my own habitation.\r\n\r\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still\r\nawhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked up with the\r\nutmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave\r\nGod thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I\r\nwas distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that,\r\nthough I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given\r\nme so many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for than\r\nto complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable\r\ncondition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of\r\nHis blessing; which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to\r\nall the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to be\r\nmuch easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was\r\nbefore: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in\r\nsearch of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not\r\nexpecting, any thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the\r\ncovered, woody part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose. I\r\nknew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least\r\nfootsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years\r\nmore as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to\r\nthem, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business\r\nto keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better\r\nsort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I\r\nentertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been\r\nspeaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and\r\neating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close\r\nwithin my own circle, for almost two years after this; when I say my\r\nown circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, my\r\ncountry-seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure in the woods:\r\nnor did I look after this for any other use than as an enclosure for my\r\ngoats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches\r\nwas such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the Devil\r\nhimself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this time,\r\nbut began rather to think of making me another; for I could not think of\r\never making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island\r\nto me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea; in which\r\nif I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what would\r\nhave been my lot.\r\n\r\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of\r\nbeing discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about\r\nthem; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before;\r\nonly with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes\r\nmore about me, than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any\r\nof them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest\r\nany of them being on the island should happen to hear it. It was\r\ntherefore a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with\r\na tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the\r\nwoods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it\r\nwas by traps and snares, as I had done before: so that for two years\r\nafter this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went\r\nout without it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out\r\nof the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them,\r\nsticking them in my goat-skin belt. I also furbished up one of the great\r\ncutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on\r\nalso; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went\r\nabroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the particular\r\nof two pistols, and a great broad-sword hanging at my side in a belt,\r\nbut without a scabbard.\r\n\r\nThings going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting\r\nthese cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate way of living.\r\nAll these things tended to show me, more and more, how far my condition\r\nwas from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other\r\nparticulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have made my\r\nlot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among\r\nmankind at any condition of life, if people would rather compare their\r\ncondition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be\r\nalways comparing them with those which are better, to assist their\r\nmurmurings and complainings.\r\n\r\nAs in my present condition there were not really many things which I\r\nwanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had been in about these\r\nsavage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,\r\nhad taken off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences; and I\r\nhad dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts too much\r\nupon, and that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley into\r\nmalt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical\r\nthought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I\r\npresently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the\r\nmaking my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply: as, first,\r\ncasks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed\r\nalready, I could never compass; no, though I spent not only many days,\r\nbut weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next\r\nplace, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no\r\ncopper or kettle to make it boil; and yet, with all these things\r\nwanting, I verily believe, had not the frights and terrors I was in\r\nabout the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought\r\nit to pass too; for I seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing\r\nit, when once I had it in my head to begin it. But my invention now ran\r\nquite another way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how\r\nI might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, bloody\r\nentertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring\r\nhither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work\r\nis intended to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather\r\nbrooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at\r\nleast frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more:\r\nbut all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect,\r\nunless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one man do\r\namong them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them\r\ntogether, with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they\r\ncould shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?\r\n\r\nSometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made\r\ntheir fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when\r\nthey kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all\r\nthat was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to\r\nwaste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity\r\nof one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any\r\ncertain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would\r\ndo little more than just blow the fire about their ears, and fright\r\nthem, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it\r\naside; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some\r\nconvenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and, in the\r\nmiddle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be sure\r\nto kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling in\r\nupon them with my three pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that\r\nif there were twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my\r\nthoughts for some weeks; and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed\r\nof it, and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my\r\nsleep. I went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself\r\nseveral days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I\r\nsaid, to watch for them; and I went frequently to the place itself,\r\nwhich was now grown more familiar to me: but while my mind was thus\r\nfilled with thoughts of revenge, and a bloody putting twenty or thirty\r\nof them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the place,\r\nand at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another,\r\nabetted my malice. Well, at length, I found a place in the side of the\r\nhill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of\r\ntheir boats coming: and might then, even before they would be ready to\r\ncome on shore, convey myself, unseen, into some thickets of trees, in\r\none of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely and\r\nthere I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full\r\naim at their heads, when they were so close together as that it would be\r\nnext to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail\r\nwounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this place, then, I\r\nresolved to fix my design; and, accordingly, I prepared two muskets and\r\nmy ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of\r\nslugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of\r\npistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of\r\nswan-shot, of the largest size: I also loaded my pistols with about four\r\nbullets each; and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a\r\nsecond and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my imagination,\r\nput it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning up to the\r\ntop of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three\r\nmiles, or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming\r\nnear the island, or standing over towards it: but I began to tire of\r\nthis hard duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept\r\nmy watch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not,\r\nin all that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the\r\nshore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I\r\nkept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the\r\nwhile in a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the killing\r\ntwenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all\r\nentered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my\r\npassions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural\r\ncustom of the people of that country; who, it seems, had been suffered\r\nby Providence, in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other\r\nguide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and,\r\nconsequently, were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act\r\nsuch horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but\r\nnature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish\r\ndegeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I\r\nbegan to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long\r\nand so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself\r\nbegan to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to\r\nconsider what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to\r\npretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom\r\nHeaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go\r\non, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments one upon\r\nanother. How far these people were offenders against me, and what right\r\nI had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed\r\npromiscuously upon one another, I debated this very often with myself,\r\nthus: How do I know what God himself judges in this particular case? It\r\nis certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not against\r\ntheir own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching them; they\r\ndo not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of\r\ndivine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it\r\nno more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an\r\nox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.\r\n\r\nWhen I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was\r\ncertainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not murderers in\r\nthe sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than\r\nthose Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners\r\ntaken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole\r\ntroops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw\r\ndown their arms and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me,\r\nthat although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and\r\ninhuman, yet it was really nothing to me; these people had done me no\r\ninjury: that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary, for my\r\nimmediate preservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for\r\nit; but that I was yet out of their power, and they really had no\r\nknowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it\r\ncould not be just for me to fall upon them: that this would justify the\r\nconduct of the Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in America,\r\nwhere they destroyed millions of these people: who, however they were\r\nidolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in\r\ntheir customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were\r\nyet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting\r\nthem out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and\r\ndetestation by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all\r\nother Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and\r\nunnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and for\r\nwhich the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and\r\nterrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if\r\nthe kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race\r\nof men who were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels\r\nof pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous\r\ntemper in the mind.\r\n\r\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\r\nstop; and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to\r\nconclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the\r\nsavages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless\r\nthey first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to\r\nprevent; but that if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my\r\nduty. On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was the\r\nway not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for\r\nunless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at\r\nthat time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of\r\nthem escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they would\r\ncome over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and\r\nI should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at\r\npresent, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon the whole, I concluded,\r\nthat neither in principle nor in policy, I ought, one way or other, to\r\nconcern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all possible\r\nmeans, to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to\r\nthem to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island, I\r\nmean of human shape. Religion joined in with this prudential resolution;\r\nand I was convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty\r\nwhen I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent\r\ncreatures, I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty\r\nof towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were\r\nnational, and I ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the\r\ngovernor of nations, and knows how, by national punishments, to make a\r\njust retribution for national offences, and to bring public judgments\r\nupon those who offend in a public manner, by such ways as best please\r\nhim. This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater\r\nsatisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing which\r\nI now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than\r\nthat of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most humble\r\nthanks on my knees to God, that had thus delivered me from\r\nblood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the protection of his\r\nprovidence, that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or\r\nthat I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call\r\nfrom Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.\r\n\r\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far\r\nwas I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in\r\nall that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were\r\nany of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore\r\nthere or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my\r\ncontrivances against them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might\r\npresent itself, to fall upon them: only this I did, I went and removed\r\nmy boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it\r\ndown to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little\r\ncove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason\r\nof the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not come, with\r\ntheir boats, upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried away\r\nevery thing that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary\r\nfor the bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail which I had made for\r\nher, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called\r\neither anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its\r\nkind: all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of\r\nany discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any human\r\nhabitation, upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said,\r\nmore retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my\r\nconstant employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, and manage my little\r\nflock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the\r\nisland, was quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these savage\r\npeople, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts\r\nof finding any thing here, and consequently never wandered off from the\r\ncoast; and I doubt not but they might have been several times on shore\r\nafter my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as before.\r\nIndeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my\r\ncondition would have been if I had chopped upon them and been discovered\r\nbefore that, when, naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that\r\nloaded often only with small shot, I walked every where, peeping and\r\npeering about the island to see what I could get; what a surprise should\r\nI have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had,\r\ninstead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing\r\nme, and by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping\r\nthem! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and\r\ndistressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover it, to think\r\nwhat I should have done, and how I should not only have been unable to\r\nresist them, but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do\r\nwhat I might have done; much less what now, after so much consideration\r\nand preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking\r\nof these things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last\r\na great while; but I resolved it all, at last, into thankfulness to that\r\nProvidence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had\r\nkept from me those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in\r\ndelivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such\r\nthing depending, or the least supposition of its being possible. This\r\nrenewed a contemplation which often had come to my thoughts in former\r\ntime, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in\r\nthe dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we are\r\ndelivered when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary,\r\n(as we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that\r\nway, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that\r\nway: nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has\r\ncalled to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from\r\nwe know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall over-rule\r\nus to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that\r\nway which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought to have\r\ngone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many like\r\nreflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever\r\nI found those secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing\r\nany thing that presented, or going this way or that way, I never failed\r\nto obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other reason for it than\r\nthat such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could give\r\nmany examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life,\r\nbut more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy\r\nisland; besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have\r\ntaken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I see with\r\nnow. But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all\r\nconsidering men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary\r\nincidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight\r\nsuch secret intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible\r\nintelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot\r\naccount for; but certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits,\r\nand a secret communication between those embodied and those unembodied,\r\nand such a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall have\r\noccasion to give some very remarkable instances in the remainder of my\r\nsolitary residence in this dismal place.\r\n\r\nI believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess that\r\nthese anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that\r\nwas now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the\r\ncontrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations and\r\nconveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than\r\nthat of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood\r\nnow, for fear the noise I might make should be heard: much less would I\r\nfire a gun, for the same reason: and, above all, I was intolerably\r\nuneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great\r\ndistance in the day, should betray me. For this reason I removed that\r\npart of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots and\r\npipes, &c. into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been\r\nsome time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave\r\nin the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no\r\nsavage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture\r\nin; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted\r\nnothing so much as a safe retreat.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where by\r\nmere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe\r\nall such things now to Providence,) I was cutting down some thick\r\nbranches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe\r\nthe reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus: I was afraid of\r\nmaking a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could\r\nnot live there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I\r\ncontrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under\r\nturf, till it became chark, or dry coal: and then putting the fire out,\r\nI preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other services for\r\nwhich fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by the\r\nby:--While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind a\r\nvery thick branch of low brush-wood, or under-wood, there was a kind of\r\nhollow place: I was curious to look in it, and getting with difficulty\r\ninto the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large: that is to say,\r\nsufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me:\r\nbut I must confess to you that I made more haste out than I did in,\r\nwhen, looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I\r\nsaw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew\r\nnot, which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave's mouth\r\nshining directly in, and making the reflection. However, after some\r\npause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools,\r\nand to think, that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to\r\nlive twenty years in an island all alone; and that I might well think\r\nthere was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon\r\nthis, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed\r\nagain, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in,\r\nbut I was almost as much frightened as I was before; for I heard a very\r\nloud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a\r\nbroken noise, as of words half-expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I\r\nstepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me\r\ninto a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer\r\nfor it, that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up\r\nmy spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with\r\nconsidering that the power and presence of God was every where, and was\r\nable to protect me, upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light\r\nof the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on\r\nthe ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat just making his\r\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life; and dying, indeed, of mere old\r\nage. I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he\r\nessayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with\r\nmyself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened me, so he would\r\ncertainly fright any of the savages, if any one of them should be so\r\nhardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.\r\n\r\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I\r\nfound the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about\r\ntwelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square,\r\nno hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere\r\nNature. I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it\r\nthat went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon\r\nmy hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not: so\r\nhaving no candle, I gave it over for that time; but resolved to come\r\nagain the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had\r\nmade of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild fire in the pan.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my\r\nown making (for I made very good candles now of goats' tallow, but was\r\nhard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and\r\nsometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles;) and going into this\r\nlow place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said, almost\r\nten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough,\r\nconsidering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.\r\nWhen I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I\r\nbelieve near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in\r\nthe island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of\r\nthis vault or cave; the wall reflected an hundred thousand lights to me\r\nfrom my two candles. What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any\r\nother precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I\r\nknew not. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of\r\nits kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry\r\nand level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there\r\nwas no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any\r\ndamp or wet on the sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the\r\nentrance; which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a\r\nretreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was\r\nreally rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to\r\nbring some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place;\r\nparticularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all\r\nmy spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all, and\r\nthree muskets, for of them I had eight in all: so I kept at my castle\r\nonly five, which stood ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my\r\noutmost fence; and were ready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon\r\nthis occasion of removing my ammunition, I happened to open the barrel\r\nof powder, which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I\r\nfound that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the\r\npowder on every side, which, caking, and growing hard, had preserved the\r\ninside like a kernel in the shell; so that I had near sixty pounds of\r\nvery good powder in the centre of the cask: this was a very agreeable\r\ndiscovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never\r\nkeeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for\r\nfear of a surprise of any kind: I also carried thither all the lead I\r\nhad left for bullets.\r\n\r\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were said to\r\nlive in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for\r\nI persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were\r\nto hunt me, they could never find me out; or, if they did, they would\r\nnot venture to attack me here. The old goat, whom I found expiring, died\r\nin the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery: and I\r\nfound it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and\r\ncover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to\r\nprevent offence to my nose.\r\n\r\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island; and\r\nwas so naturalized to the place, and the manner of living, that could I\r\nhave but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place\r\nto disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for\r\nspending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had\r\nlaid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived\r\nto some little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a\r\ngreat deal more pleasantly with me than it did before: as, first, I had\r\ntaught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly,\r\nand talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me;\r\nfor I believe no bird ever spoke plainer; and he lived with me no less\r\nthan six and twenty years: how long he might have lived afterwards I\r\nknow not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they\r\nlive a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to\r\nme for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old\r\nage. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that\r\ndegree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep\r\nthem from devouring me and all I had; but, at length, when the two old\r\nones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually\r\ndriving them from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they\r\nall ran wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I\r\nkept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and\r\nthese were part of my family. Besides these, I always kept two or three\r\nhousehold kids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had\r\ntwo more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin\r\nCrusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with\r\nany of them that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls,\r\nwhose names I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their\r\nwings; and the little stakes which I had planted before my castle wall\r\nbeing now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among\r\nthese low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so\r\nthat, as I said above, I began to be very well contented with the life I\r\nled, if I could have been secured from the dread of the savages. But it\r\nwas otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall\r\nmeet with my story, to make this just observation from it, viz. How\r\nfrequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek\r\nmost to shun, and which, when we are, fallen into, is the most dreadful\r\nto us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which\r\nalone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I\r\ncould give many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life;\r\nbut in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the\r\ncircumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.\r\n\r\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\r\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\r\nit,) was the particular time of my harvest, and required my being pretty\r\nmuch abroad in the fields: when going out pretty early in the morning,\r\neven before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a\r\nlight of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two\r\nmiles, towards the end of the island where I had observed some savages\r\nhad been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great\r\naffliction, it was on my side of the island.\r\n\r\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within\r\nmy grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised, and yet I had\r\nno more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these\r\nsavages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or\r\ncut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately\r\nconclude that there were people in the place, and would then never give\r\nover till they had found me out. In this extremity, I went back directly\r\nto my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without\r\nlook as wild and natural as I could.\r\n\r\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence:\r\nI loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my muskets,\r\nwhich were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and\r\nresolved to defend myself to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to\r\ncommend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to\r\ndeliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this\r\nposture about two hours; and began to be mighty impatient for\r\nintelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting\r\nawhile longer, and musing what I should do in this, I was not able to\r\nbear sitting in ignorance any longer; so setting up my ladder to the\r\nside of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before,\r\nand then pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted\r\nto the top of the hill; and pulling out my perspective-glass, which I\r\nhad taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and\r\nbegan to look for the place. I presently found there were no less than\r\nnine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had made, not to\r\nwarm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely\r\nhot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human\r\nflesh, which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead, I\r\ncould not tell.\r\n\r\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore;\r\nand as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return\r\nof the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion\r\nthis sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of the\r\nisland, and so near me too; but when I considered their coming must be\r\nalways with the current of the ebb, I began, afterwards, to be more\r\nsedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety\r\nall the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before: and\r\nhaving made this observation, I went abroad about my harvest-work with\r\nthe more composure.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the\r\nwestward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it)\r\naway. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went\r\noff, they went a dancing; and I could easily discern their postures and\r\ngestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation,\r\nbut that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon\r\nthem; but whether they were men or women, I could not distinguish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\r\nshoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side,\r\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make, went away\r\nto the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as\r\nsoon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could\r\nnot go apace, being so loaden with arms as I was,) I perceived there had\r\nbeen three canoes more of savages at that place; and looking out\r\nfarther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main.\r\nThis was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore,\r\nI could see the marks of horror, which the dismal work they had been\r\nabout had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the\r\nflesh, of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with\r\nmerriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that\r\nI now began to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there,\r\nlet them be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the\r\nvisits which they made thus to this island were not very frequent, for\r\nit was above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there\r\nagain; that is to say, I neither saw them; nor any footsteps or signals\r\nof them, in all that time; for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are\r\nsure not to come abroad, at least not so far: yet all this while I lived\r\nuncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming\r\nupon me by surprise: from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil\r\nis more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to\r\nshake off that expectation, or those apprehensions.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I was in the murdering humour, and took up most of\r\nmy hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\r\ncircumvent and fall upon them, the very next time I should see them;\r\nespecially if they should be divided, as they were the last time, into\r\ntwo parties: nor did I consider at all, that if I killed one party,\r\nsuppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to\r\nkill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I should be at\r\nlength no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters, and\r\nperhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great perplexity and\r\nanxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one day or other, fall into\r\nthe hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time\r\nventure abroad, it was not without looking round me with the greatest\r\ncare and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how\r\nhappy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I\r\ndurst not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near that side of\r\nthe island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and\r\nif they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again, with\r\nperhaps two or three hundred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I\r\nknew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more\r\nbefore I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again,\r\nas I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have been there once or\r\ntwice, but either they made no stay, or at least I did not see them: but\r\nin the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four and\r\ntwentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months'\r\ninterval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful\r\ndreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night: in the day great\r\ntroubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night, I dreamed often of\r\nkilling the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify the doing of\r\nit. But, to wave all this for a while.--It was in the middle of May, on\r\nthe sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would\r\nreckon, for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the\r\nsixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a\r\ngreat deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after\r\nit. I knew not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was\r\nreading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my\r\npresent condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I\r\nthought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a\r\ndifferent nature from any I had met with before; for the notions this\r\nput into my thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the\r\ngreatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the\r\nmiddle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the\r\nsecond time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of\r\nfire bid me listen for a second gun, which accordingly, in about half a\r\nminute, I heard; and, by the sound, knew that it was from that part of\r\nthe sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately\r\nconsidered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had\r\nsome comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these guns for\r\nsignals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at\r\nthat minute, to think, that though I could not help them, it might be\r\nthey might help me: so I brought together all the dry wood I could get\r\nat hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the\r\nhill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and though the wind blew very\r\nhard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there was any\r\nsuch thing as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for\r\nas soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and after that\r\nseveral others, all from the same quarter, I plied my fire all night\r\nlong, till daybreak; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up,\r\nI saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the island,\r\nwhether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glass;\r\nthe distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also; at\r\nleast it was so out at sea.\r\n\r\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\r\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and\r\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand,\r\nand ran towards the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had\r\nformerly been carried away with the current; and getting up there, the\r\nweather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my\r\ngreat sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\r\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which\r\nrocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\r\ncounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the\r\nmost desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in, all my life.\r\nThus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction; for it\r\nseems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and\r\nthe rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the\r\nnight, the wind blowing hard at E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I\r\nmust necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have\r\nendeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;\r\nbut their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I\r\nimagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts: first, I imagined that\r\nupon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their boat,\r\nand endeavoured to make the shore; but that the sea going very high,\r\nthey might have been cast away: other times I imagined that they might\r\nhave lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as,\r\nparticularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many\r\ntimes obliges men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes\r\nto throw it overboard with their own hands: other times I imagined they\r\nhad some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of\r\ndistress they had made, had taken them up and carried them off: other\r\ntimes I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being\r\nhurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were carried\r\nout into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and\r\nperishing; and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of starving,\r\nand of being in a condition to eat one another.\r\n\r\nAs all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was\r\nin, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and\r\npity them; which had still this good effect on my side, that it gave me\r\nmore and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and\r\ncomfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two\r\nships' companies who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not\r\none life should be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,\r\nthat it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into any\r\ncondition of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see\r\nsomething or other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse\r\ncircumstances than our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of\r\nwhom I could not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved;\r\nnothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they\r\ndid not all perish there, except the possibility only of their being\r\ntaken up by another ship in company; and this was but mere possibility\r\nindeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing. I\r\ncannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange longing\r\nor hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out\r\nsometimes thus: \"O that there had been but one or two, nay, or but one\r\nsoul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I might but\r\nhave had one companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to\r\nhave conversed with!\" In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt\r\nso earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures,\r\nor so deep a regret at the want of it.\r\n\r\nThere are some secret moving springs in the affections, which, when they\r\nare set a going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet\r\nrendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion\r\ncarries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager\r\nembracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable. Such\r\nwere these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I\r\nrepeated the words, \"O that it had been but one!\" a thousand times; and\r\nmy desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands\r\nwould clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms of my\r\nhands, so that if I had had any soft thing in my hand, it would have\r\ncrushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my head would strike\r\ntogether, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I\r\ncould not part them again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and\r\nthe reason and manner of them: all I can say to them is, to describe the\r\nfact, which was even surprising to me, when I found it, though I knew\r\nnot from whence it proceeded: it was doubtless the effect of ardent\r\nwishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort\r\nwhich the conversation of one of my fellow-christians would have been to\r\nme.--But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade\r\nit: for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew\r\nwhether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the\r\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on\r\nshore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had no\r\nclothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers,\r\nand a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess\r\nwhat nation he was of: he had nothing in his pockets but two\r\npieces-of-eight and a tobacco-pipe;--the last was to me of ten times\r\nmore value than the first.\r\n\r\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to\r\nthis wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might\r\nbe useful to me: but that did not altogether press me so much as the\r\npossibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose\r\nlife I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my\r\nown to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart, that I\r\ncould not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on\r\nboard this wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought\r\nthe impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted,\r\nthat it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be\r\nwanting to myself if I did not go.\r\n\r\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,\r\nprepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great\r\npot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had\r\nstill a great deal of that left,) and a basket of raisins: and thus,\r\nloading myself with every thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got\r\nthe water out of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and\r\nthen went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice,\r\nthe umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot of\r\nfresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes,\r\nmore than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese: all which,\r\nwith great labour and sweat, I carried to my boat; and praying to God to\r\ndirect my voyage, I put out; and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along\r\nthe shore, came at last to the utmost point of the island on the\r\nnorth-east side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either\r\nto venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran\r\nconstantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were\r\nvery terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in\r\nbefore, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was\r\ndriven into either of those currents, I should be carried a great way\r\nout to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island again;\r\nand that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind\r\nshould rise, I should be inevitably lost.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my\r\nenterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore,\r\nI stepped out, and sat me down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive\r\nand anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was\r\nmusing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come\r\non; upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this,\r\npresently it occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of\r\nground I could find, and observe, if I could how the sets of the tide,\r\nor currents, lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if\r\nI was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way\r\nhome, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no\r\nsooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill, which\r\nsufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear\r\nview of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide\r\nmyself in my return. Here I found, that as the current of the ebb set\r\nout close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood\r\nset in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to\r\ndo but to keep to the north side of the island in my return, and I\r\nshould do well enough.\r\n\r\nEncouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set\r\nout with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my\r\ncanoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first\r\nmade a little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit\r\nof the current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great\r\nrate; and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had\r\ndone before, so as to take from me all government of the boat; but\r\nhaving a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly\r\nfor the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It was a\r\ndismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish,\r\nstuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of\r\nher were beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle, which\r\nstuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and\r\nforemast were brought by the board, that is to say, broken short off;\r\nbut her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I\r\ncame close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,\r\nyelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to\r\ncome to me; I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead with\r\nhunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it\r\nlike a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow: I\r\nthen gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I would\r\nhave let him, he would have burst himself. After this, I went on board;\r\nbut the first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or\r\nforecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. I\r\nconcluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in\r\na storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that the\r\nmen were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant\r\nrushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water.\r\nBesides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor\r\nany goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There\r\nwere some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay\r\nlower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;\r\nbut they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I\r\nbelieved belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into the\r\nboat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been\r\nfixed, and the fore-part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a\r\ngood voyage; for, by what I found in these two chests, I had room to\r\nsuppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may\r\nguess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos\r\nAyres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the\r\nBrazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.\r\nShe had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time,\r\nto any body; and what became of her crew, I then knew not.\r\n\r\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\r\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There\r\nwere several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\r\nfour pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for\r\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fireshovel and\r\ntongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a\r\ncopper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron: and with this cargo, and\r\nthe dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the\r\nsame evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again,\r\nweary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat;\r\nand in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave,\r\nand not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all\r\nmy cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of\r\nliquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the\r\nBrazils, and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the\r\nchests, I found several things of great use to me: for example, I found\r\nin one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with\r\ncordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three pints\r\neach, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good\r\nsuccades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top, that the salt\r\nwater had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water had\r\nspoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me;\r\nand about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured\r\nneckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being exceeding\r\nrefreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to\r\nthe till in the chest, I found there three great bags of\r\npieces-of-eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in\r\none of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some\r\nsmall bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a\r\npound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but,\r\nby the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate; though\r\nthere was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder, in\r\nthree small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces\r\non occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was\r\nof any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for\r\nit; it was to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it\r\nall for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were\r\nthings I greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for many years. I had\r\nindeed got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two\r\ndrowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one of\r\nthe chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were not like our\r\nEnglish shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call\r\npumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty\r\npieces-of-eight in rials, but no gold: I suppose this belonged to a\r\npoorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well,\r\nhowever, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had\r\ndone that before which I brought from our own ship: but it was a great\r\npity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my\r\nshare; for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times\r\nover with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might\r\nlie here safe enough till I may come again and fetch it.\r\n\r\nHaving now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went back\r\nto my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old\r\nharbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old\r\nhabitation, where I found every thing safe and quiet. I began now to\r\nrepose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family\r\naffairs; and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more\r\nvigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so\r\nmuch; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to\r\nthe east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the\r\nsavages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions,\r\nand such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I\r\nwent the other way. I lived in this condition near two years more; but\r\nmy unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my\r\nbody miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and\r\ndesigns, how, if it were possible, I might get away from this island:\r\nfor, sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck, though my\r\nreason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my\r\nvoyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe\r\nverily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have\r\nventured to sea, bound any where, I knew not whither. I have been, in\r\nall my circumstances, a _memento_ to those who are touched with the\r\ngeneral plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their\r\nmiseries flow; I mean that of not being satisfied with the station\r\nwherein God and nature hath placed them: for, not to look back upon my\r\nprimitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the\r\nopposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original sin_, my\r\nsubsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming\r\ninto this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which so happily\r\nseated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires,\r\nand I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have\r\nbeen, by this time, I mean in the time of my being in this island, one\r\nof the most considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded,\r\nthat by the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there,\r\nand the increase I should probably have made if I had remained, I might\r\nhave been worth a hundred thousand moidores: and what business had I to\r\nleave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and\r\nincreasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience\r\nand time would have so increased our stock at home, that we could have\r\nbought them at our own door from those whose business it was to fetch\r\nthem? and though it had cost us something more, yet the difference of\r\nthat price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard. But as\r\nthis is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly of\r\nit is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought\r\nexperience of time: so it was with me now; and yet so deep had the\r\nmistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my\r\nstation, but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of my\r\nescape from this place: and that I may, with the greater pleasure to the\r\nreader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper\r\nto give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this\r\nfoolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation I acted.\r\n\r\nI am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\r\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\r\ncondition restored to what it was before; I had more wealth, indeed,\r\nthan I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use\r\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four and\r\ntwentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude, I\r\nwas lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; very well in health, had no\r\npain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind,\r\nmore than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as\r\nto sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows:--It\r\nis impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled\r\nthrough that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this\r\nnight's time: I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or\r\nby abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also\r\nof that part of my life since I came to this island. In my reflections\r\nupon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was\r\ncomparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my\r\nhabitation here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which\r\nI had lived in, ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand;\r\nnot that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even\r\nall the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on\r\nshore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any\r\napprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger\r\nwas the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had\r\nnever really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with many\r\nvery profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How infinitely\r\ngood that Providence is, which has provided, in its government of\r\nmankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and\r\nthough he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of\r\nwhich, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his\r\nspirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid\r\nfrom his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.\r\n\r\nAfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect\r\nseriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this\r\nvery island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and\r\nwith all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow\r\nof a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been\r\nbetween me and the worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into\r\nthe hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the\r\nsame view as I would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more\r\na crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or curlew. I would\r\nunjustly slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to\r\nmy great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with\r\ngreat humility, all these unknown deliverances were due, and without\r\nwhich I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands.\r\n\r\nWhen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\r\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\r\nand how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of all\r\nthings should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to\r\nsomething so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its own\r\nkind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations,\r\nit occurred to me to inquire, what part of the world these wretches\r\nlived in? how far off the coast was, from whence they came? what they\r\nventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and why\r\nI might not order myself and my business so, that I might be as able to\r\ngo over thither as they were to come to me?\r\n\r\nI never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\r\nmyself when I went thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the\r\nhands of the savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attacked\r\nme; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,\r\nand not be attacked by some or other of them, without any possibility of\r\ndelivering myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, what I\r\nshould do for provision, or whither I should bend my course: none of\r\nthese thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was wholly\r\nbent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land. I\r\nlooked upon my present condition as the most miserable that could\r\npossibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into any thing, but\r\ndeath, that could be called worse; and if I reached the shore of the\r\nmain, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did\r\non the African shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I\r\nmight find some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might fall in with\r\nsome Christian ship that might take me in; and if the worst came to the\r\nworst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries at\r\nonce. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an\r\nimpatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of\r\nmy troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been\r\non board of, and where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly\r\nlonged for, viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from\r\nthem of the place where I was, and of the probable means of my\r\ndeliverance. I was agitated wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of\r\nmind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the\r\ndispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were,\r\nno power to turn my thoughts to any thing but to the project of a voyage\r\nto the main; which came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity\r\nof desire, that it was not to be resisted.\r\n\r\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such\r\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as\r\nif I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my\r\nmind about it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the\r\nvery thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought\r\nI should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of any thing relating\r\nto it: out I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning, as usual,\r\nfrom my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages\r\ncoming to land, and that they brought with them another savage, whom\r\nthey were going to kill, in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the\r\nsavage that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life;\r\nand I thought, in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick\r\ngrove before my fortification, to hide himself; and that I, seeing him\r\nalone, and not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed\r\nmyself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled\r\ndown to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my\r\nladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my\r\nservant: and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, \"Now\r\nI may certainly venture to the main land; for this fellow will serve me\r\nas a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for\r\nprovisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what\r\nplaces to venture into, and what to shun.\" I waked with this thought;\r\nand was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of\r\nmy escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon coming\r\nto myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally\r\nextravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great dejection\r\nof spirits.\r\n\r\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion; that my only way to go about\r\nto attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a savage into my\r\npossession; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners whom\r\nthey had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But\r\nthese thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that it was\r\nimpossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and\r\nkilling them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and\r\nmight miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the\r\nlawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of\r\nshedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not\r\nrepeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the\r\nsame mentioned before: but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz.\r\nthat those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they\r\ncould; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver\r\nmyself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as\r\nmuch as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though\r\nthese things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for\r\nmy deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means\r\nreconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after many\r\nsecret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for\r\nall these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long\r\ntime,) the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all\r\nthe rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into\r\nmy hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do\r\nit, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: but as I could\r\npitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon\r\nthe watch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to\r\nthe event; taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let\r\nwhat would be.\r\n\r\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\r\noften as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired of it;\r\nfor it was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of\r\nthat time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the\r\nisland, almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This\r\nwas very discouraging, and began to trouble me much; though I cannot say\r\nthat it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off the\r\nedge of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,\r\nthe more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful to\r\nshun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was\r\nnow eager to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,\r\nnay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely\r\nslaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their\r\nbeing able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I\r\npleased myself with this affair; but nothing still presented; all my\r\nfancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near me for a\r\ngreat while.\r\n\r\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long\r\nmusing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an\r\noccasion to put them into execution,) I was surprised, one morning\r\nearly, with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my\r\nside the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed, and out\r\nof my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so\r\nmany, and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more,\r\nin a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my\r\nmeasures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in\r\nmy castle, perplexed and discomforted: however, I put myself into all\r\nthe same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was\r\njust ready for action, if any thing had presented. Having waited a good\r\nwhile, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very\r\nimpatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to\r\nthe top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however,\r\nthat my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not\r\nperceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my\r\nperspective-glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that\r\nthey had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had\r\ncooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I\r\nknow not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way,\r\nround the fire.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\r\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\r\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\r\nthem immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\r\nwooden sword, for that was their way, and two or three others were at\r\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\r\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.\r\nIn that very moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at\r\nliberty, and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he\r\nstarted away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the\r\nsands, directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the coast where\r\nmy habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when\r\nI perceived him run my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw him\r\npursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream was\r\ncoming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove:\r\nbut I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,\r\nviz. that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find him\r\nthere. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover, when\r\nI found that there was not above three men that followed him; and still\r\nmore was I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly\r\nin running, and gained ground of them; so that if he could but hold it\r\nfor half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.\r\n\r\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\r\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the\r\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\r\nwretch would be taken there: but when the savage escaping came thither,\r\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\r\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on\r\nwith exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to\r\nthe creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\r\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but\r\nwent no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it\r\nhappened, was very well for him in the end. I observed, that the two who\r\nswam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek as the\r\nfellow was that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon my\r\nthoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a\r\nservant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and that I was called\r\nplainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately\r\nran down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,\r\nfor they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed above, and\r\ngetting up again, with the same haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed\r\ntowards the sea, and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed\r\nmyself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud\r\nto him that fled, who, looking back, was at first, perhaps, as much\r\nfrightened at me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come\r\nback; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that\r\nfollowed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down\r\nwith the stock of my piece. I was loth to fire, because I would not have\r\nthe rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily\r\nheard, and being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not have\r\neasily known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the\r\nother who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I\r\nadvanced apace towards him: but as I came nearer, I perceived presently\r\nhe had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was\r\nthen necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at\r\nthe first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw\r\nboth his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened\r\nwith the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and\r\nneither came forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined\r\nstill to fly, than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs\r\nto come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way; then\r\nstopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could\r\nthen perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,\r\nand had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to\r\nhim again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement\r\nthat I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down\r\nevery ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his\r\nlife. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to\r\ncome still nearer: at length he came close to me; and then he kneeled\r\ndown again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and\r\ntaking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in\r\ntoken of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much\r\nof him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do\r\nyet; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked down was not killed, but\r\nstunned with the blow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to\r\nhim, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke\r\nsome words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought\r\nthey were pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man's\r\nvoice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years.\r\nBut there was no time for such reflections now; the savage who was\r\nknocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and\r\nI perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I\r\npresented my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this\r\nmy savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my\r\nsword, which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner\r\nhad it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head so\r\ncleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better;\r\nwhich I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never\r\nsaw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however,\r\nit seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so\r\nsharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads\r\neven with them, aye, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had\r\ndone this, he comes laughing to me, in sign of triumph, and brought me\r\nthe sword again, and with abundance of gestures, which I did not\r\nunderstand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had\r\nkilled, just before me. But that which astonished him most, was to know\r\nhow I killed the other Indian so far off: so pointing to him, he made\r\nsigns to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could.\r\nWhen he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning\r\nhim first on one side, then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet\r\nhad made, which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a\r\nhole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled\r\ninwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came\r\nback; so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making\r\nsigns to him that more might come after them. Upon this, he made signs\r\nto me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by\r\nthe rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so.\r\nHe fell to work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the sand\r\nwith his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him\r\ninto it, and covered him; and did so by the other also: I believe he had\r\nburied them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I\r\ncarried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther\r\npart of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass in that part,\r\nviz. that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and\r\na bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was\r\nindeed in great distress for, by his running; and having refreshed him,\r\nI made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place\r\nwhere I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to\r\nsleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight\r\nstrong limbs, not too large, tall, and well shaped; and, as I reckon,\r\nabout twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a\r\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his\r\nface; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an European in\r\nhis countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and\r\nblack, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a\r\ngreat vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his\r\nskin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow,\r\nnauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of\r\nAmerica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it\r\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face was\r\nround and plump; his nose small, not flat like the Negroes; a very good\r\nmouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory.\r\n\r\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he awoke\r\nagain, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats,\r\nwhich I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me, he came\r\nrunning to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the\r\npossible signs of an humble thankful disposition, making a great many\r\nantic gestures to show it. At last, he lays his head flat upon the\r\nground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he\r\nhad done before; and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection,\r\nservitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me know how he would serve\r\nme so long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him\r\nknow I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak\r\nto him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let him know his\r\nname should be FRIDAY, which was the day I saved his life: I called him\r\nso for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master; and\r\nthen let him know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him to say\r\nYes and No, and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an\r\nearthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in\r\nit; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly\r\ncomplied with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I kept\r\nthere with him all that night; but as soon as it was day, I beckoned to\r\nhim to come with me, and let him know I would give him some clothes; at\r\nwhich he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the\r\nplace where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place,\r\nand showed me the marks that he had made to find them again, making\r\nsigns to me that we should dig them up again, and eat them. At this I\r\nappeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would\r\nvomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come\r\naway; which he did immediately, with great submission. I then led him up\r\nto the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out\r\nmy glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but\r\nno appearance of them or their canoes; so that it was plain they were\r\ngone, and had left their two comrades behind them, without any search\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nBut I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\r\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving\r\nhim the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I\r\nfound he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,\r\nand I two for myself; and away we marched to the place where these\r\ncreatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence\r\nof them. When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins,\r\nand my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it\r\nwas a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made\r\nnothing of it. The place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed\r\nwith their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and there,\r\nhalf-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the\r\ntriumphant feast they had been making there, after a victory over their\r\nenemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four\r\nlegs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday,\r\nby his signs, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners\r\nto feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing\r\nto himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great battle between\r\nthem and their next king, whose subject, it seems, he had been one of,\r\nand that they had taken a great number of prisoners; all which were\r\ncarried to several places by those who had taken them in the fight, in\r\norder to feast upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those\r\nthey brought hither.\r\n\r\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\r\nremained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon\r\nit, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering\r\nstomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature;\r\nbut I discovered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at\r\nthe least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I had, by\r\nsome means, let him know, that I would kill him if he offered it.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to\r\nwork for my man Friday: and, first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\r\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which I\r\nfound in the wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very\r\nwell: and then I made him a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill\r\nwould allow (for I was now grown a tolerable good tailor;) and I gave\r\nhim a cap, which I made of hare's-skin, very convenient and fashionable\r\nenough: and thus he was clothed for the present, tolerably well, and was\r\nmighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.\r\nIt is true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first; wearing the\r\ndrawers was very awkward to him; and the sleeves of the waistcoat\r\ngalled his shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a little easing\r\nthem where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he\r\ntook to them at length very well.\r\n\r\nThe next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to consider\r\nwhere I should lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be\r\nperfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place\r\nbetween my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and in the\r\noutside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my\r\ncave, I made a formal framed door case, and a door to it of boards, and\r\nset it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing the\r\ndoor to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my\r\nladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my\r\ninnermost wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it\r\nmust needs waken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it\r\nof long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the\r\nhill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths,\r\nand then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was\r\nstrong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in or\r\nout by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had\r\nbeen attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would\r\nhave fallen down, and make a great noise: as to weapons, I took them all\r\ninto my side every night. But I needed none of all this precaution; for\r\nnever man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than Friday was\r\nto me; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and\r\nengaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a\r\nfather; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving\r\nmine, upon any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of\r\nthis put it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no\r\nprecautions, as to my safety on his account.\r\n\r\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\r\nhowever it had pleased God, in his providence, and in the government of\r\nthe works of his hands, to take from so great a part of the world of his\r\ncreatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of their\r\nsouls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers,\r\nthe same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness\r\nand obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same\r\nsense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing\r\ngood, and receiving good, that he has given to us; and that when he\r\npleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready,\r\nnay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which they were\r\nbestowed, than we are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in\r\nreflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we make\r\nof all these, even though we have these powers enlightened by the great\r\nlamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word\r\nadded to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the like\r\nsaving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge\r\nby this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.\r\nFrom hence, I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of\r\nProvidence, and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a\r\ndisposition of things, that should hide that light from some, and reveal\r\nit to others, and yet expect a like duty from both; but I shut it up,\r\nand checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, That we did not\r\nknow by what light and law these should be condemned; but that as God\r\nwas necessarily, and, by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and\r\njust, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to\r\nabsence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that light,\r\nwhich, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules\r\nas their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation\r\nwas not discovered to us; and, secondly, That still, as we all are the\r\nclay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, \"Why hast\r\nthou formed me thus?\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to my new companion:--I was greatly delighted with him,\r\nand made it my business to teach him every thing that was proper to make\r\nhim useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\r\nunderstand me when I spoke: and he was the aptest scholar that ever was;\r\nand particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased\r\nwhen he could but understand me, or make me understand him, that it was\r\nvery pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy,\r\nthat I began to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more\r\nsavages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place where\r\nI lived.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought\r\nthat, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and\r\nfrom the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other\r\nflesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,\r\nindeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home\r\nand dress it; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the\r\nshade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of\r\nFriday;--Hold, said I; stand still; and made signs to him not to stir:\r\nimmediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The\r\npoor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage,\r\nhis enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was\r\nsensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that I\r\nthought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or\r\nperceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether\r\nhe was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to\r\nkill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees,\r\nsaid a great many things I did not understand; but I could easily see\r\nthe meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.\r\n\r\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\r\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which\r\nI had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did: and\r\nwhile he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed,\r\nI loaded my gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk,\r\nsitting upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little\r\nwhat I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which\r\nwas indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,\r\npointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the\r\nparrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that\r\nI would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him\r\nlook, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one\r\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he\r\nwas the more amazed, because he did not see me put any thing into the\r\ngun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and\r\ndestruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing\r\nnear or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such, as\r\ncould not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let\r\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he\r\nwould not so much as touch it for several days after; but he would speak\r\nto it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by\r\nhimself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to\r\nkill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I\r\npointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but\r\nstaid some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered\r\naway a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found\r\nher, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his\r\nignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun\r\nagain, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any\r\nother mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time: so\r\nI brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and\r\ncut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that purpose, I\r\nboiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After\r\nI had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of\r\nit, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest to him, was to\r\nsee me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good\r\nto eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate\r\nit, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water\r\nafter it: on the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without\r\nsalt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as\r\nhe had done at the salt; but it would not do; he would never care for\r\nsalt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and\r\nthen but a very little.\r\n\r\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast\r\nhim the next day with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did, by\r\nhanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in\r\nEngland, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one\r\nacross on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the\r\nmeat turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came\r\nto taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked\r\nit, that I could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as well\r\nas he could, he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very\r\nglad to hear.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting it\r\nin the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood\r\nhow to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the\r\nmeaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that I\r\nlet him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time\r\nFriday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do\r\nit myself.\r\n\r\nI began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one,\r\nI must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity\r\nof corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and\r\nbegan the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not\r\nonly very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I\r\ntold him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,\r\nbecause he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and\r\nmyself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that\r\nhe thought I had much more labour upon me on his account, than I had for\r\nmyself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place;\r\nFriday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\r\nevery thing I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\r\nhim to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to\r\nhave some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\r\noccasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure\r\nof talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself:\r\nhis simple unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and\r\nI began really to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he\r\nloved me more than it was possible for him ever to love any\r\nthing before.\r\n\r\nI had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his own\r\ncountry again; and having taught him English so well that he could\r\nanswer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he\r\nbelonged to never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said,\r\n\"Yes, yes, we always fight the better:\" that is, he meant, always get\r\nthe better in fight; and so we began the following discourse:\r\n\r\n_Master_. You always fight the better; how came you to be taken prisoner\r\nthen, Friday?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. My nation beat much for all that.\r\n\r\n_Master_. How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. They more many than my nation in the place where me was; they\r\ntake one, two, three, and me: my nation over-beat them in the yonder\r\nplace, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great thousand.\r\n\r\n_Master_. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\r\nenemies then?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe; my\r\nnation have no canoe that time.\r\n\r\n_Master_. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\r\ntake? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\r\n\r\n_Master_. Where do they carry them?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. Go to other place, where they think.\r\n\r\n_Master_. Do they come hither?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\r\n\r\n_Master_. Have you been here with them?\r\n\r\n_Friday_. Yes, I have been here (points to the N.W. side of the island,\r\nwhich, it seems, was their side.)\r\n\r\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\r\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\r\nthe same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and, some time\r\nafter, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same\r\nI formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he was\r\nthere once when they eat up twenty men, two women, and one child: he\r\ncould not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by laying so\r\nmany stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\r\n\r\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows; that after\r\nI had this discourse with him, I asked him how far it was from our\r\nisland to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told\r\nme there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that, after a little\r\nway out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in the\r\nmorning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no more\r\nthan the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I afterwards\r\nunderstood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty\r\nriver Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found\r\nafterwards, our island lay; and that this land which I perceived to the\r\nW. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the\r\nmouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the\r\ncountry, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were\r\nnear: he told me all he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. I\r\nasked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but\r\ncould get no other name than Caribs: from whence I easily understood,\r\nthat these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of\r\nAmerica which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana,\r\nand onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the\r\nmoon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from\r\ntheir country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my\r\ngreat whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed much\r\nmans, that was his word: by all which I understood, he meant the\r\nSpaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole\r\ncountry, and were remembered by all the nations, from father to son.\r\n\r\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island and get\r\namong those white men; he told me, Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe. I\r\ncould not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he\r\nmeant by two canoe; till, at last, with great difficulty, I found he\r\nmeant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of\r\nFriday's discourse began to relish with me very well; and from this time\r\nI entertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an\r\nopportunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor savage\r\nmight be a means to help me.\r\n\r\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he began\r\nto speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation\r\nof religious knowledge in his mind: particularly I asked him one time,\r\nWho made him? The poor creature did not understand me at all, but\r\nthought I had asked him who was his father: but I took it up by another\r\nhandle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the\r\nhills and woods? He told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived\r\nbeyond all; he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he\r\nwas very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the\r\nmoon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all\r\nthings, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and\r\nwith a perfect look of innocence said, All things say O to him. I asked\r\nhim if the people who die in his country went away any where? He said,\r\nYes; they all went to Benamuckee: then I asked him whether these they\r\neat up went thither too? He said, Yes.\r\n\r\nFrom these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\r\nGod: I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\r\npointing up towards heaven; that he governed the world by the same power\r\nand providence by which he made it; that he was omnipotent, and could do\r\nevery thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing from us;\r\nand thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great\r\nattention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being\r\nsent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and\r\nhis being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if\r\nour God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God\r\nthan their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not\r\nhear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to\r\nhim. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? He said, No;\r\nthey never went that were young men; none went thither but the old men,\r\nwhom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him explain it to me,\r\ntheir religious, or clergy; and that they went to say O (so he called\r\nsaying prayers,) and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee said.\r\nBy this I observed, that there is priestcraft even among the most\r\nblinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret\r\nof religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the\r\nclergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all\r\nreligions in the world, even among the most brutish and\r\nbarbarous savages.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him,\r\nthat the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O to\r\ntheir god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence\r\nwhat he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or\r\nspake with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I\r\nentered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original of\r\nhim, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his\r\nsetting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped\r\ninstead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to\r\ndelude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our\r\npassions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our\r\ninclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run\r\nupon our destruction by our own choice.\r\n\r\nI found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about\r\nthe devil, as it was about the being of a God: nature assisted all my\r\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,\r\nand over-ruling, governing Power, a secret, directing Providence, and of\r\nthe equity and justice of paying homage to him that made us, and the\r\nlike; but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil\r\nspirit; of his original, his being, his nature, and, above all, of his\r\ninclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too: and the poor\r\ncreature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural\r\nand innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking\r\na great deal to him of the power of God, his omnipotence, his aversion\r\nto sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as\r\nhe had made us all, he could destroy us and all the world in a moment;\r\nand he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After this,\r\nI had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in the hearts of\r\nmen, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of\r\nProvidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the\r\nlike. \"Well,\" says Friday, \"but you say God is so strong, so great; is\r\nhe not much strong, much might as the devil?\"--\"Yes, yes,\" says I,\r\n\"Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is above the devil, and\r\ntherefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable us\r\nto resist his temptations, and quench his fiery darts.\"--\"But,\" says he\r\nagain, \"if God much stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill\r\nthe devil, so make him no more do wicked?\" I was strangely surprised at\r\nthis question; and, after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was\r\nbut a young doctor, and ill qualified for a casuist, or a solver of\r\ndifficulties; and, at first, I could not tell what to say; so I\r\npretended not to hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too\r\nearnest for an answer, to forget his question, so that he repeated it in\r\nthe very same broken words as above. By this time I had recovered myself\r\na little, and I said, \"God will at last punish him severely; he is\r\nreserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to\r\ndwell with everlasting fire.\" This did not satisfy Friday; but he\r\nreturns upon me, repeating my words, \"_Reserve at last_! me no\r\nunderstand: but why not kill the devil now; not kill great ago?\"--\"You\r\nmay as well ask me,\" said I, \"why God does not kill you and me, when we\r\ndo wicked things here that offend him: we are preserved to repent and be\r\npardoned.\" He mused some time on this: \"Well, well,\" says he, mighty\r\naffectionately, \"that well: so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve,\r\nrepent, God pardon all.\" Here I was run down again by him to the last\r\ndegree; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,\r\nthough they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,\r\nand of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the\r\nconsequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form\r\nthe knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us, of a\r\nMediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of\r\nGod's throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form these\r\nin the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour\r\nJesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised\r\nfor the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary\r\ninstructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the\r\nmeans of salvation.\r\n\r\nI therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man, rising\r\nup hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then sending him\r\nfor something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God that he would\r\nenable me to instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by his\r\nSpirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of\r\nthe knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would\r\nguide me to speak so to him from the word of God, as his conscience\r\nmight be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came\r\nagain to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject\r\nof the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and of the\r\ndoctrine of the gospel preached from heaven, viz. of repentance towards\r\nGod, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him as\r\nwell as I could; why our blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of\r\nangels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that reason, the fallen\r\nangels had no share in the redemption; that he came only to the lost\r\nsheep of the house of Israel, and the like.\r\n\r\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I\r\ntook for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge, what I\r\nbelieve all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying\r\nthings open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many\r\nthings that either I did not know, or had not fully considered before,\r\nbut which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for\r\nthe information of this poor savage; and I had more affection in my\r\ninquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so\r\nthat, whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had\r\ngreat reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat\r\nlighter upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure:\r\nand when I reflected, that in this solitary life which I had been\r\nconfined to, I had not only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and\r\nto seek to the hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made an\r\ninstrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew,\r\nthe soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of\r\nreligion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ\r\nJesus, in whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all these\r\nthings, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I frequently\r\nrejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often\r\nthought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have\r\nbefallen me.\r\n\r\nI continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and the\r\nconversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such,\r\nas made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and\r\ncompletely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can he formed\r\nin a sublunary state. This savage was now a good Christian, a much\r\nbetter than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that\r\nwe were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We had here\r\nthe word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct,\r\nthan if we had been in England. I always applied myself, in reading the\r\nScriptures, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I\r\nread; and he again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me,\r\nas I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture-knowledge than\r\nI should ever have been by my own mere private reading. Another thing I\r\ncannot refrain from observing here also, from experience in this retired\r\npart of my life, viz. how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is\r\nthat the knowledge of God; and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ\r\nJesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so easy to be\r\nreceived and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me\r\ncapable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to\r\nthe great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a\r\nSaviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and\r\nobedience to all God's commands, and this without any teacher or\r\ninstructor, I mean human; so the same plain instruction sufficiently\r\nserved to the enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to be\r\nsuch a Christian, as I have known few equal to him in my life.\r\n\r\nAs to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have\r\nhappened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or\r\nschemes of church-government, they were all perfectly useless to us,\r\nand, for aught I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the\r\nworld. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we\r\nhad, blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and\r\ninstructing us by his word, leading us into all truth, and making us\r\nboth willing and obedient to the instruction of his word. And I cannot\r\nsee the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of\r\nreligion, which have made such confusions in the world, would have been\r\nto us, if we could have obtained it.--But I must go on with the\r\nhistorical part of things, and take every part in its order.\r\n\r\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could\r\nunderstand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though\r\nin broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at\r\nleast so much of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had\r\nlived here, and how long: I let him into the mystery, for such it was to\r\nhim, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a\r\nknife; which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt,\r\nwith a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in\r\nthe frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only\r\nas good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nI described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I\r\ncame from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one\r\nanother, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave\r\nhim an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed\r\nhim, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten\r\nin pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we\r\nlost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength\r\nthen; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat,\r\nFriday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it\r\nwas he studied upon? At last, says he, \"Me see such boat like come to\r\nplace at my nation.\" I did not understand him a good while; but, at\r\nlast, when I had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a\r\nboat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where he\r\nlived; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of\r\nweather. I presently imagined that some European ship must have been\r\ncast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive\r\nashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought of men making their\r\nescape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so I only\r\ninquired after a description of the boat.\r\n\r\nFriday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to\r\nunderstand him when he added with some warmth, \"We save the white mans\r\nfrom drown.\" Then I presently asked him, if there were any white mans,\r\nas he called them, in the boat? \"Yes,\" he said; \"the boat full of white\r\nmans.\" I asked him how many? He told upon his fingers seventeen, I\r\nasked him then what became of them? He told me, \"They live, they dwell\r\nat my nation.\"\r\n\r\nThis put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these\r\nmight be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight\r\nof my island, as I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on\r\nthe rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in\r\ntheir boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages. Upon\r\nthis, I inquired of him more critically what was become of them; he\r\nassured me they lived still there; that they had been there about four\r\nyears; that the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live\r\non. I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat\r\nthem? He said, \"No, they make brother with them;\" that is, as I\r\nunderstood him, a truce; and then he added, \"They no eat mans but when\r\nmake the war fight;\" that is to say, they never eat any men but such as\r\ncome to fight with them, and are taken in battle.\r\n\r\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the\r\nhill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I\r\nhad, in a clear day, discovered the main or continent of America,\r\nFriday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the\r\nmain land, and, in a kind of surprise, fells a jumping and dancing, and\r\ncalls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what\r\nwas the matter? \"O joy!\" says he; \"O glad! there see my country, there\r\nmy nation!\" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in\r\nhis face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a\r\nstrange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again.\r\nThis observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made\r\nme at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before; and I\r\nmade no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own nation again,\r\nhe would not only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me,\r\nand would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and\r\ncome back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon\r\nme, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his\r\nenemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest\r\ncreature very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as\r\nmy jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more\r\ncircumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before: in which I\r\nwas certainly in the wrong too; the honest, grateful creature, having no\r\nthought about it, but what consisted with the best principles, both as a\r\nreligious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared afterwards,\r\nto my full satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day pumping\r\nhim, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I\r\nsuspected were in him: but I found every thing he said was so honest and\r\nso innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in\r\nspite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again;\r\nnor did he, in the least, perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I\r\ncould not suspect him of deceit.\r\n\r\nOne day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea, so\r\nthat we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, \"Friday,\r\ndo not you wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?\"--\"Yes,\"\r\nhe said, \"I be much O glad to be at my own nation.\" \"What would you do\r\nthere?\" said I: \"would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and\r\nbe a savage as you were before?\" He looked full of concern, and shaking\r\nhis head, said, \"No, no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to\r\npray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no eat man\r\nagain.\"--\"Why then,\" said I to him, \"they will kill you.\" He looked\r\ngrave at that, and then said, \"No, no; they no kill me, they willing\r\nlove learn.\" He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added,\r\nthey learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I\r\nasked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told me\r\nthat he could not swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe for him.\r\nHe told me he would go, if I would go with him. \"I go!\" says I, \"why,\r\nthey will eat me if I come there.\"--\"No, no,\" says he, \"me make they no\r\neat you; me make they much love you,\" He meant, he would tell them how I\r\nhad killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them\r\nlove me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to\r\nseventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on\r\nshore there in distress.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over, and see if I\r\ncould possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese: not doubting but if I could, we might find\r\nsome method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good\r\ncompany together, better than I could from an island forty miles off the\r\nshore, and alone, without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to\r\nwork again, by way of discourse; and told him I would give him a boat to\r\ngo back to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate,\r\nwhich lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it of\r\nwater (for I always kept it sunk in water,) I brought it out, showed it\r\nhim, and we both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at\r\nmanaging it, and would make it go almost as swift again as I could. So\r\nwhen he was in, I said to him, \"Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your\r\nnation?\" He looked very dull at my saying so; which, it seems, was\r\nbecause he thought the boat too small to go so far: I then told him I\r\nhad a bigger; so the next day I went to the place where the first boat\r\nlay which I had made, but which I could not get into the water. He said\r\nthat was big enough: but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had\r\nlain two or three and twenty years there, the sun had split and dried\r\nit, that, it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do\r\nvery well, and would carry \"much enough vittle, drink, bread;\" that was\r\nhis way of talking.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over\r\nwith him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make one as\r\nbig as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one word, but\r\nlooked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him? He\r\nasked me again, \"Why you angry mad with Friday? what me done?\" I asked\r\nhim what he meant: I told him I was not angry with him at all. \"No\r\nangry!\" says he, repeating the words several times, \"why send Friday\r\nhome away to my nation?\"--\"Why,\" says I, \"Friday, did not you say you\r\nwished you were there?\"--\"Yes, yes,\" says he, \"wish be both there; no\r\nwish Friday there, no master there.\" In a word, he would not think of\r\ngoing there without me. \"I go there, Friday!\" says I, \"what shall I do\r\nthere?\" He returned very quick upon me at this: \"You do great deal much\r\ngood,\" says he; \"you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell\r\nthem know God, pray God, and live new life.\"--\"Alas! Friday,\" says I,\r\n\"thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man\r\nmyself.\"--\"Yes, yes,\" says he, \"you teachee me good, you teachee them\r\ngood.\"--\"No, no, Friday,\" says I, \"you shall go without me; leave me\r\nhere to live by myself, as I did before.\" He looked confused again at\r\nthat word; and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he\r\ntakes it up hastily, and gives it to me. \"What must I do with this?\"\r\nsays I to him. \"You take kill Friday,\" says he. \"What must I kill you\r\nfor?\" said I again. He returns very quick, \"What you send Friday away\r\nfor? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away.\" This he spoke so earnestly,\r\nthat I saw tears stand in his eyes: in a word, I so plainly discovered\r\nthe utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I\r\ntold him then, and often after, that I would never send him away from\r\nme, if he was willing to stay with me.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a settled affection to\r\nme, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the\r\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent\r\naffection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing,\r\nwhich, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or\r\nintention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong\r\ninclination to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on the\r\nsupposition gathered from the discourse, viz. that there were seventeen\r\nbearded men there: and, therefore, without any more delay, I went to\r\nwork with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a\r\nlarge periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees\r\nenough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas, or\r\ncanoes, but even of good large vessels: but the main thing I looked at\r\nwas, to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was\r\nmade, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched\r\nupon a tree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood\r\nwas fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call the\r\ntree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call fustic,\r\nor between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same\r\ncolour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this\r\ntree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with\r\ntools; which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily:\r\nand in about a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it very\r\nhandsome; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to\r\nhandle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat.\r\nAfter this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her\r\nalong, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but\r\nwhen she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.\r\n\r\nWhen she was in the water, and though she was so big, it amazed me to\r\nsee with what dexterity, and how swift my man Friday would manage her,\r\nturn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we\r\nmight venture over in her. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we venture over in her very\r\nwell, though great blow wind.\" However, I had a farther design that he\r\nknew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her\r\nwith an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so\r\nI pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the\r\nplace, and which there were great plenty of in the island: and I set\r\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and\r\norder it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had\r\nold sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough; but as I had had them\r\nnow six and twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to\r\npreserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use\r\nfor them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of\r\nthem were so. However, I found two pieces, which appeared pretty good,\r\nand with these I went to work; and with a great deal of pains, and\r\nawkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I, at length,\r\nmade a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a\r\nshoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short\r\nsprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with, and\r\nsuch as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one I had to the\r\nboat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first\r\npart of my story.\r\n\r\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and\r\nfitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a\r\nsmall stay, and a sail, or fore-sail, to it, to assist, if we should\r\nturn to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the\r\nstern of her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I\r\nknew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I applied\r\nmyself with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass;\r\nthough, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed,\r\nI think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.\r\n\r\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what\r\nbelonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well how\r\nto paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder;\r\nand was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the\r\nsea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way, or that\r\nway, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood\r\nlike one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I made all\r\nthese things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except\r\nthat as to the compass; I could make him understand very little of that.\r\nOn the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom\r\nor never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a\r\ncompass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore\r\nby day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir\r\nabroad, either by land or sea.\r\n\r\nI was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my captivity in\r\nthis place; though the three last years that I had this creature with me\r\nought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of\r\nanother kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of\r\nmy landing here with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at\r\nfirst; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much\r\nmore so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of\r\nProvidence over me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and\r\nspeedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts\r\nthat my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year\r\nin this place. I went on, however, with my husbandry; digging, planting,\r\nand fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every\r\nnecessary thing as before.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when I kept more within\r\ndoors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we\r\ncould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the\r\nbeginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the\r\nshore, at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just\r\nbig enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to\r\nfloat in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across\r\nthe end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the\r\ntide, from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many\r\nboughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house; and\r\nthus we waited for the months of November and December, in which I\r\ndesigned to make my adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design\r\nreturned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage:\r\nand the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of\r\nprovisions, being the stores for our voyage: and intended, in a week or\r\na fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was\r\nbusy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday,\r\nand bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle, or\r\ntortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of\r\nthe eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he\r\ncame running back and flew over my outer-wall, or fence, like one that\r\nfelt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and before I had\r\ntime to speak to him, he cries out to me, \"O master! O master! O sorrow!\r\nO bad!\"--\"What's the matter, Friday?\" says I. \"O yonder, there,\" says\r\nhe, \"one, two, three canoe; one, two, three!\" By this way of speaking, I\r\nconcluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was but three.\r\n\"Well, Friday,\" says I, \"do not be frightened.\" So I heartened him up\r\nas well as I could: however, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\r\nscared; for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for\r\nhim, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow\r\ntrembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him as\r\nwell as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that\r\nthey would eat me as well as him. \"But,\" says I, \"Friday, we must\r\nresolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday!\"--\"Me shoot,\" says he;\r\nbut there come many great number.\"--No matter for that,\" said I, again;\r\n\"our guns will fright them that we do not kill.\" So I asked him whether,\r\nif I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do\r\njust as I bid him. He said, \"Me die, when you bid die, master.\" So I\r\nwent and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had been so good\r\na husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he drank it, I\r\nmade him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and\r\nloaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets; then I\r\ntook four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five small\r\nbullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each;\r\nI hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his\r\nhatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass,\r\nand went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover; and I\r\nfound quickly, by my glass, that there were one and twenty savages,\r\nthree prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business seemed\r\nto be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous\r\nfeast indeed! but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with\r\nthem. I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had done\r\nwhen Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek: where the shore was\r\nlow, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This,\r\nwith the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about,\r\nfilled me with such indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and\r\ntold him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked\r\nhim if he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, and his\r\nspirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very\r\ncheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.\r\n\r\nIn this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had charged, as\r\nbefore, between us: I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and\r\nthree guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol, and the other three\r\nguns, myself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle\r\nof rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and\r\nbullets; and, as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and\r\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him; and, in the mean\r\ntime, not to speak a word. In this posture, I fetched a compass to my\r\nright hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into\r\nthe wood, so that I might come within shot of them before I should be\r\ndiscovered, which I had seen, by my glass, it was easy to do.\r\n\r\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\r\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\r\nnumber; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\r\nsuperior to them; nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my\r\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in,\r\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done\r\nor intended me any wrong? Who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\r\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a token\r\nindeed of God's having left them, with the other nations of that part of\r\nthe world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not\r\ncall me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an\r\nexecutioner of his justice; that, whenever he thought fit, he would take\r\nthe cause into his own hands, and, by national vengeance, punish them,\r\nas a people, for national crimes; but that, in the mean time, it was\r\nnone of my business; that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because\r\nhe was a declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very\r\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could\r\nnot say the same with respect to myself. These things were so warmly\r\npressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would\r\nonly go and place myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous\r\nfeast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that, unless\r\nsomething offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would\r\nnot meddle with them.\r\n\r\nWith this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all possible\r\nweariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched\r\ntill I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to\r\nthem, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I\r\ncalled softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at\r\nthe corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if\r\nhe could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so; and came\r\nimmediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there;\r\nthat they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of their\r\nprisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them,\r\nwhich, he said, they would kill next, and which fired the very soul\r\nwithin me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the\r\nbearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I\r\nwas filled with horror at the very naming the white-bearded man; and,\r\ngoing to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon\r\nthe beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or\r\nthings like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\r\n\r\nThere was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty\r\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\r\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I\r\nshould be within half a shot of them: so I withheld my passion, though I\r\nwas indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\r\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\r\nthe other tree; and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a\r\nfull view of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.\r\n\r\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\r\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\r\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by\r\nlimb, to their fire; and they were stooping down to untie the bands at\r\nhis feet. I turned to Friday--\"Now, Friday,\" said I, \"do as I bid thee.\"\r\nFriday said he would. \"Then, Friday,\" says I, \"do exactly as you see me\r\ndo; fail in nothing.\" So I set down one of the muskets and the\r\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with\r\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the\r\nlike: then asking him if he was ready, he said, \"Yes.\" \"Then fire at\r\nthem,\" said I; and the same moment I fired also.\r\n\r\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\r\nshot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side, I\r\nkilled one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\r\nconsternation; and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon their feet,\r\nbut did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for\r\nthey knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes\r\nclose upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so,\r\nas soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up\r\nthe fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he saw me cock and present;\r\nhe did the same again. \"Are you ready, Friday?\" said I.--\"Yes,\" says he.\r\n\"Let fly, then,\" says I, \"in the name of God!\" and with that, I fired\r\nagain among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces\r\nwere now loaden with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets,\r\nwe found only two drop, but so many were wounded, that they ran about\r\nyelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them\r\nmiserably wounded, whereof three more fell quickly after, though not\r\nquite dead.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Friday,\" says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\r\nthe musket which was yet loaden, \"follow me;\" which he did with a great\r\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood, and showed myself,\r\nand Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\r\nshouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as\r\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with\r\narms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I\r\nsaid, lying upon, the beach, or shore, between the place where they sat\r\nand the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had\r\nleft him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible\r\nfright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of\r\nthe rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step\r\nforwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running\r\nabout forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he\r\nhad killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat,\r\nthough I saw two of them up again quickly: however, he killed two of\r\nthem, and wounded the third so, that he lay down in the bottom of the\r\nboat as if he had been dead.\r\n\r\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\r\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\r\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He\r\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\r\nscarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it\r\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\r\npiece of bread, which he eat. Then I asked him what countryman he was:\r\nand he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\r\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his\r\ndeliverance. \"Seignior,\" said I, with as much Spanish as I could make\r\nup, \"we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have any\r\nstrength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.\" He took\r\nthem very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but,\r\nas if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like\r\na fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth\r\nis, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so\r\nmuch frightened with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for\r\nmere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt their own\r\nescape, than their flesh had to resist our shot: and that was the case\r\nof those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell\r\nwith the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright.\r\n\r\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep\r\nmy charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:\r\nso I called to Friday, and bade-him run up to the tree from whence we\r\nfirst fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been\r\ndischarged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving him my\r\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them come\r\nto me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened\r\na fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who\r\nmade at him with one of their great wooden swords, the same-like weapon\r\nthat was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The\r\nSpaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak,\r\nhad fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two great wounds on\r\nhis head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with\r\nhim, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of\r\nhis hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the\r\nsword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the\r\nbody, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help\r\nhim, could come near him.\r\n\r\nFriday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, with\r\nno weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dispatched those\r\nthree, who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all\r\nthe rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun,\r\nI gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the\r\nsavages, and wounded them both; but, as he was not able to run, they\r\nboth got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed\r\none of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and though he was\r\nwounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all his\r\nmight, off to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in the\r\ncanoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were\r\nall that escaped our hands of one and twenty; the account of the whole\r\nis as follows: three killed at our first shot from the tree; two killed\r\nat the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday\r\nof those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood; three\r\nkilled by the Spaniard; four killed, being found dropped here and there,\r\nof their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four escaped\r\nin the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.--Twenty-one in all.\r\n\r\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\r\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he\r\nhit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\r\ncanoes, and pursue them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their\r\nescape, lest carrying the news home to their people, they should come\r\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by\r\nmere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one\r\nof their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was\r\nin the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie there,\r\nbound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost\r\ndead with fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not been\r\nable to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and\r\nheels, and had been tied so long, that he had really but little life\r\nin him.\r\n\r\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound him\r\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak, but\r\ngroaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only\r\nunbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak\r\nto him, and tell him of his deliverance; and, pulling out my bottle,\r\nmade him give the poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being\r\ndelivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came\r\nto hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to\r\ntears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,\r\ncried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung; then cried again,\r\nwrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then sung and jumped\r\nabout again, like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I\r\ncould make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when he\r\ncame a little to himself, he told me that it was his father.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and\r\nfilial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\r\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can I\r\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this; for he went\r\ninto the boat, and out of the boat, a great many times: when he went in\r\nto him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's\r\nhead close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish it; then\r\nhe took his arms and ancles, which were numbed and stiff with the\r\nbinding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving\r\nwhat the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with,\r\nwhich did them a great deal of good.\r\n\r\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\r\nsavages, who were now got almost out of sight; and it was happy for us\r\nthat we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before\r\nthey could be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard\r\nall night, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I\r\ncould not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their\r\nown coast.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father, that I could\r\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time: but after I thought\r\nhe could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and\r\nlaughing, and pleased to the highest extreme; then I asked him if he\r\nhad given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, \"None; ugly\r\ndog eat all up self,\" I then gave him a cake of bread, out of a little\r\npouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he\r\nwould not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket two\r\nor three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his\r\nfather. He had no sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him\r\ncome out of the boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran\r\nat such a rate; for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I\r\nsaw: I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were,\r\nin an instant; and though I called, and hallooed out too, after him, it\r\nwas all one, away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come\r\nback again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I\r\nfound his pace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he\r\ncame up to me, I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug, or\r\npot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he had two more\r\ncakes or loaves of bread; the bread he gave me, but the water he carried\r\nto his father; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took, a little sup\r\nof it. The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I\r\nhad given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.\r\n\r\nWhen his father had drank, I called to him to know, if there was any\r\nwater left: he said, \"Yes;\" and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard,\r\nwho was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the\r\ncakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very\r\nweak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a\r\ntree; and whose limbs were also very stiff and very much swelled with\r\nthe rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that, upon Friday's\r\ncoming to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,\r\nand began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of raisins: he\r\nlooked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness\r\nthat could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding\r\nhe had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon\r\nhis feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not able,\r\nhis ancles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit\r\nstill, and caused Friday to rub his ancles, and bathe them with rum, as\r\nhe had done his father's.\r\n\r\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps\r\nless, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if his\r\nfather was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at\r\nlast he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and,\r\nwithout speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could\r\nscarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he\r\ncame, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so\r\nFriday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to\r\nlet Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\r\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him: but\r\nFriday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back,\r\nand carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side\r\nor gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then\r\nlifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently\r\nstepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the\r\nshore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too: so\r\nhe brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat,\r\nran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and\r\nasked him whither he went. He told me, \"Go fetch more boat:\" so away he\r\nwent like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had\r\nthe other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land; so\r\nhe wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests out of the boat,\r\nwhich he did; but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor\r\nFriday knew not what to do.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\r\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of\r\na hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\r\ntogether upon it, between us.\r\n\r\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\r\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them\r\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down: so I set to work again;\r\nand Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent,\r\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in\r\nthe space without our outward fence, and between, that and the grove of\r\nyoung wood which I had planted: and here we made them two beds of such\r\nthings as I had, viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it,\r\nto lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.\r\n\r\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\r\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king\r\nI looked. First of all, the whole country was my own mere property, so\r\nthat I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were\r\nperfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all owed\r\ntheir lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had\r\nbeen occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three\r\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions: my man Friday was\r\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\r\nwas a Papist: however, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\r\ndominions:--But this is by the way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them\r\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\r\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\r\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\r\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\r\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made them\r\na very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put some\r\nbarley and rice also into the broth: and as I cooked it without doors,\r\nfor I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into the\r\nnew tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and eat my\r\ndinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them, and\r\nencouraged them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father,\r\nand, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of\r\nthe savages pretty well.\r\n\r\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\r\nthe canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for\r\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle: and, the next day, I\r\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\r\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him to\r\nbury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were\r\npretty much, and which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could\r\nnot bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually\r\nperformed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there;\r\nso that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise\r\nthan by the corner of the wood pointing to the place.\r\n\r\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\r\nsubjects: and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\r\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might\r\nexpect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist. His\r\nfirst opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out the\r\nstorm which blew that night they went off, but must, of necessity, be\r\ndrowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure\r\nto be devoured as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away: but,\r\nas to what they would do, if they came safe on shore, he said he knew\r\nnot; but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frightened\r\nwith the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that\r\nhe believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder\r\nand lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared,\r\nviz. Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to\r\ndestroy them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew; because\r\nhe heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it\r\nwas impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and\r\nspeak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as\r\nwas done now: and this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood\r\nsince, by other hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the\r\nisland afterwards, they were so terrified with the accounts given by\r\nthose four men (for, it seems, they did escape the sea,) that they\r\nbelieved whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with\r\nfire from the gods. This, however, I knew not; and therefore was under\r\ncontinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard,\r\nwith all my army: for, as there were now four of us, I would have\r\nventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time.\r\n\r\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\r\ncoming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to\r\nthe main into consideration; being likewise assured, by Friday's\r\nfather, that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his\r\naccount, if I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I\r\nhad a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that\r\nthere were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having\r\nbeen cast away, and made their escape to that side, lived there at\r\npeace, indeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for\r\nnecessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of\r\ntheir voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de\r\nla Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there,\r\nwhich was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European\r\ngoods they could meet with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen\r\non board, whom they took out of another wreck; that five of their own\r\nmen were drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped,\r\nthrough infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on\r\nthe cannibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every\r\nmoment. He told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly\r\nuseless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the\r\nsea having spoiled all their powder, but a little, which they used, at\r\ntheir first landing, to provide themselves some food.\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had\r\nformed any design of making their escape. He said they had many\r\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel, nor tools to\r\nbuild one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in\r\ntears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a\r\nproposal from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if\r\nthey were all here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom, I\r\nfeared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life in\r\ntheir hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of\r\nman, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they\r\nhad received, so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I\r\ntold him it would be very hard that I should be the instrument of their\r\ndeliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in\r\nNew Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what\r\nnecessity, or what accident soever brought him thither; and that I had\r\nrather be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall\r\ninto the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the\r\nInquisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all\r\nhere, we might, with so many hands, build a bark large enough to carry\r\nus all away, either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or\r\nSpanish coast, northward; but that if, in requital, they should, when I\r\nhad put weapons into their hands, carry me by force among their own\r\npeople, I might be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my case\r\nworse than it was before.\r\n\r\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\r\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that,\r\nhe believed, they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\r\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that if I pleased, he would\r\ngo to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it and return\r\nagain, and bring me their answer; that he would make conditions with\r\nthem upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my\r\nleading, as their commander and captain; and that they should swear upon\r\nthe holy sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such\r\nChristian country as that I should agree to, and no other, and to be\r\ndirected wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed\r\nsafely in such country as I intended; and that he would bring a contract\r\nfrom them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me he would\r\nfirst swear to me himself, that he would never stir from me as long as\r\nhe lived, till I gave him orders; and that he would take my side to the\r\nlast drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith\r\namong his countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,\r\nhonest men, and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having\r\nneither weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and\r\ndiscretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their\r\nown country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief,\r\nthey would live and die by me.\r\n\r\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\r\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to\r\ntreat. But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard\r\nhimself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it, on one\r\nhand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be\r\nvery well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance\r\nof his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus: He had been\r\nwith us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what\r\nmanner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my\r\nsupport; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up;\r\nwhich, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not\r\nsufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased\r\nto four; but much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who\r\nwere, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over; and, least of\r\nall, would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build\r\none, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America; so he\r\ntold me he thought it would be more adviseable to let him and the other\r\ntwo dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to\r\nsow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we might have a\r\nsupply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come; for want might\r\nbe a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves\r\ndelivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. \"You\r\nknow,\" says he, \"the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at first\r\nfor their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God\r\nhimself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the\r\nwilderness.\"\r\n\r\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\r\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\r\nwith his fidelity: so we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the\r\nwooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a month's\r\ntime, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land\r\ncured and trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty bushels of barley on,\r\nand sixteen jars of rice; which was, in short, all the seed we had to\r\nspare: nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own\r\nfood, for the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say,\r\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not\r\nto be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\r\n\r\nHaving now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us out\r\nof fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been\r\nvery great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\r\noccasion; and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our\r\nthoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it\r\nout of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees which I\r\nthought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting\r\nthem down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my\r\nthoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed them\r\nwith what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single\r\nplanks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had made about a\r\ndozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet\r\nlong, and from two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour\r\nit took up, any one may imagine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats\r\nas much as I could; and, for this purpose, I made Friday and the\r\nSpaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we\r\ntook our turns,) and by this means we got about twenty young kids to\r\nbreed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids,\r\nand added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing the\r\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in\r\nthe sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of\r\nthe sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and\r\nthese, with our bread, was a great part of our food, and was very good\r\nliving too, I assure you, for it is exceeding nourishing.\r\n\r\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most\r\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough\r\nto answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in\r\nand threshed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in\r\nproportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next\r\nharvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or\r\nif we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have\r\nvictualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that is\r\nto say, any part of America. When we had thus housed and secured our\r\nmagazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great\r\nbaskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and\r\ndexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some\r\nthings for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\r\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\r\nwith those he had left behind them there. I gave him a strict charge not\r\nto bring any man with him who would not first swear, in the presence of\r\nhimself and the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or\r\nattack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to\r\nsend for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand\r\nby him, and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they\r\nwent, would be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that\r\nthis should be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How they\r\nwere to have done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a\r\nquestion which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard\r\nand the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes\r\nwhich they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when\r\nthey came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of\r\nthem a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder\r\nand ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use\r\neither of them but upon urgent occasions.\r\n\r\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view\r\nof my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them\r\nprovisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for\r\nmany days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days'\r\ntime; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go; agreeing with them\r\nabout a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should\r\nknow them again, when they came back, at a distance, before they came on\r\nshore. They went away with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at\r\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\r\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it\r\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\r\nsure I was right; though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my\r\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\r\n\r\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and\r\nunforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not perhaps been\r\nheard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my\r\nman Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, \"Master, master,\r\nthey are come, they are come!\" I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I\r\nwent out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove,\r\nwhich, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I\r\nsay, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my\r\ncustom to do: but I was surprised, when turning my eyes to the sea, I\r\npresently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in\r\nfor the shore, with a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call it, and the\r\nwind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed presently,\r\nthat they did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from\r\nthe southernmost end of the island. Upon this, I called Friday in, and\r\nbade him lie close, for these were not the people we looked for, and\r\nthat we might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the\r\nnext place, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see what I could\r\nmake of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top\r\nof the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing, and\r\nto take my view the plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set\r\nmy foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an\r\nanchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from me, S.S.E. but not\r\nabove a league and a half from the shore. By my observation, it appeared\r\nplainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English\r\nlong-boat.\r\n\r\nI cannot express the confusion I was in; though the joy of seeing a\r\nship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own\r\ncountrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but\r\nyet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence\r\nthey came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it\r\noccurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in\r\nthat part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of\r\nthe world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been\r\nno storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they were\r\nreally English, it was most probable that they were here upon no good\r\ndesign; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the\r\nhands of thieves and murderers.\r\n\r\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which\r\nsometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its\r\nbeing real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that\r\nhave made any observations of things can deny; that they are certain\r\ndiscoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot\r\ndoubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why\r\nshould we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether\r\nsupreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question,) and that\r\nthey are given for our good?\r\n\r\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\r\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\r\ncome it from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far\r\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept\r\nmyself long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as\r\nif they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of\r\nlanding; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not\r\nsee the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their\r\nboat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was\r\nvery happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my door,\r\nas I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and\r\nperhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore, I was\r\nfully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two\r\nI thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven\r\nmen, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought,\r\nbound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore,\r\nthey took those three out of the boat, as prisoners: one of the three I\r\ncould perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,\r\naffliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other two,\r\nI could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared\r\nconcerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was\r\nperfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it\r\nshould be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, \"O\r\nmaster! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage\r\nmans.\"--\"Why, Friday,\" says I, \"do you think they are going to eat them\r\nthen?\"--\"Yes,\" says Friday, \"they will eat them.\"--\"No, no,\" says I,\r\n\"Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but you may be sure\r\nthey will not eat them.\"\r\n\r\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood\r\ntrembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the\r\nthree prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains\r\nlift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword,\r\nto strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every\r\nmoment; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my\r\nveins. I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was\r\ngone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within\r\nshot of them, that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw no\r\nfire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.\r\nAfter I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the\r\ninsolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the island,\r\nas if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three other\r\nmen had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down all\r\nthree upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.\r\nThis put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and began to\r\nlook about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked\r\nround me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the\r\ntree all night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As I knew\r\nnothing, that night, of the supply I was to receive by the providential\r\ndriving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I\r\nhave since been so long nourished and supported; so these three poor\r\ndesolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they\r\nwere, how near it was to them, and how effectually and really they were\r\nin a condition of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves\r\nlost, and their case desperate. So little do we see before us in the\r\nworld, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great\r\nMaker of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely\r\ndestitue, but that, in the worst circumstances, they have always\r\nsomething to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance\r\nthan they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the\r\nmeans by which they seem to be brought to their destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore;\r\nand partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they\r\nwere in, they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the\r\nwater was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had\r\nleft two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drank a\r\nlittle too much brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a\r\nlittle sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for\r\nhim to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about;\r\nupon which they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all their\r\nstrength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that\r\nside being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition,\r\nlike true seamen, who are perhaps the least of all mankind given to\r\nforethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country\r\nagain; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off\r\nfrom the boat, \"Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you? she'll float next\r\ntide:\" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what\r\ncountrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, not once\r\ndaring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place of\r\nobservation, near the top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how\r\nwell it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the\r\nboat could float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might\r\nbe at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if\r\nthey had any. In the mean time, I fitted myself up for a battle, as\r\nbefore, though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind\r\nof enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an\r\nexcellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took\r\nmyself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure,\r\nindeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the\r\ngreat cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my\r\nbelt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it\r\nwas dark: but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found\r\nthat, in short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I\r\nthought, laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious\r\nfor their condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under the\r\nshelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I\r\nthought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to\r\ndiscover myself to them, and learn something of their condition;\r\nimmediately I marched in the figure as above, my man Friday at a good\r\ndistance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making\r\nquite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near them\r\nundiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I called\r\naloud to them in Spanish, \"What are ye, gentlemen?\" They started up at\r\nthe noise; but were ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the\r\nuncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I\r\nperceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in\r\nEnglish: \"Gentlemen,\" said I, \"do not be surprised at me: perhaps you\r\nmay have a friend near, when you did not expect it.\"--\"He must be sent\r\ndirectly from Heaven then,\" said one of them very gravely to me, and\r\npulling off his hat at the same time to me; \"for our condition is past\r\nthe help of man.\"--\"All help is from Heaven, Sir,\" said I: \"But can you\r\nput a stranger in the way how to help you? for you seem to be in some\r\ngreat distress. I saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to make\r\napplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift up\r\nhis sword to kill you.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\r\nlike one astonished, returned, \"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real\r\nman or an angel?\"--\"Be in no fear about that, Sir,\" said I; \"if God had\r\nsent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and\r\narmed after another manner than you see me: pray lay aside your fears; I\r\nam a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you: you see I have one\r\nservant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve\r\nyou? What is your case?\"--\"Our case,\" said he, \"Sir, is too long to tell\r\nyou, while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, Sir, I was\r\ncommander of that ship, my men have mutinied against me; they have been\r\nhardly prevailed on not to murder me; and at last have set me on shore\r\nin this desolate place, with these two men with me, one my mate, the\r\nother a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing the place to\r\nbe uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.\"--\"Where are these\r\nbrutes, your enemies?\" said I: \"Do you know where they are\r\ngone?\"--\"There they lie, Sir,\" said he, pointing to a thicket of trees;\r\n\"my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak; if\r\nthey have, they will certainly murder us all.\"--\"Have they any\r\nfire-arms?\" said I. He answered, \"they had only two pieces, one of which\r\nthey left in the boat.\" \"Well then,\" said I, \"leave the rest to me; I\r\nsee they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them all: but shall\r\nwe rather take them prisoners?\" He told me there were two desperate\r\nvillains among them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but\r\nif they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their\r\nduty. I asked him which they were? He told me he could not at that\r\ndistance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in any thing I\r\nwould direct. \"Well,\" says I, \"let us retreat out of their view or\r\nhearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.\" So they\r\nwillingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.\r\n\r\n\"Look you, Sir,\" said I, \"if I venture upon your deliverance, are you\r\nwilling to make two conditions with me?\" He anticipated my proposals, by\r\ntelling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly\r\ndirected and commanded by me in every thing; and, if the ship was not\r\nrecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world\r\nsoever I would send him; and the two other men said the same. \"Well,\"\r\nsays I, \"my conditions are but two: first, That while you stay in this\r\nisland with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put\r\narms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me,\r\nand do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island; and, in the mean\r\ntime, be governed by my orders: secondly, That if the ship is, or may be\r\nrecovered, you will carry me and my man to England, passage free.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could\r\ndevise, that he would comply with these most reasonable demands; and,\r\nbesides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all\r\noccasions, as long as he lived. \"Well then,\" said I, \"here are three\r\nmuskets for you, with powder and ball: tell me next what you think is\r\nproper to be done.\" He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that\r\nhe was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought\r\nit was hard venturing any thing; but the best method I could think of\r\nwas to fire upon them at once, as they lay, and if any were not killed\r\nat the first volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so\r\nput it wholly upon God's providence to direct the shot. He said very\r\nmodestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it: but that\r\nthose two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all\r\nthe mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still;\r\nfor they would go on board and bring the whole ship's company, and\r\ndestroy us all. \"Well then,\" says I, \"necessity legitimates my advice,\r\nfor it is the only way to save our lives.\" However, seeing him still\r\ncautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and\r\nmanage as they found convenient.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\r\nafter we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them\r\nwere the heads of the mutiny? He said, No. \"Well then,\" said I, \"you may\r\nlet them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose\r\nto save themselves.--Now,\" says I, \"if the rest escape you, it is your\r\nfault.\" Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in his\r\nhand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with each\r\na piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going first, made\r\nsome noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and\r\nseeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late then, for\r\nthe moment he cried out they fired; I mean the two men, the captain\r\nwisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the\r\nmen they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other\r\nvery much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and\r\ncalled eagerly for help to the other; but the captain stepping to him,\r\ntold him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to\r\nforgive his villany; and with that word knocked him down with the stock\r\nof his musket, so that he never spoke more: there were three more in the\r\ncompany, and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was\r\ncome; and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist,\r\nthey begged for mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives,\r\nif they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the\r\ntreachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him\r\nin recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,\r\nfrom whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their\r\nsincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and\r\nspare their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged him to\r\nkeep them bound hand and foot while they were on the island.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the boat,\r\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they\r\ndid: and by and by three straggling men, that were (happily for them)\r\nparted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing\r\nthe captain, who before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they\r\nsubmitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\r\n\r\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another's\r\ncircumstances: I began first, and told him my whole history, which he\r\nheard with an attention even to amazement; and particularly at the\r\nwonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition;\r\nand, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected\r\nhim deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I\r\nseemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the\r\ntears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more. After this\r\ncommunication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my\r\napartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the\r\nhouse, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, and showed\r\nthem all the contrivances I had made, during my long, long inhabiting\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but,\r\nabove all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\r\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now\r\nplanted near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in\r\nEngland, was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was impassable\r\nin any part of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my little\r\nwinding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my residence,\r\nbut that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I\r\ncould retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too another time:\r\nbut at present our business was to consider how to recover the ship. He\r\nagreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what\r\nmeasures to take, for that there were still six and twenty hands on\r\nboard, who having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had\r\nall forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by\r\ndesperation, and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were subdued,\r\nthey would be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or\r\nto any of the English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no\r\nattacking them with so small a number as we were.\r\n\r\nI mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very\r\nrational conclusion, and that, therefore, something was to be resolved\r\non speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\r\nsurprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon\r\nthis, it presently occurred to me, that in a little while the ship's\r\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the boat,\r\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat, to look for them;\r\nand that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:\r\nthis he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing we\r\nhad to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they\r\nmight not carry her off: and taking every thing out of her, leave her so\r\nfar useless as not to be fit to swim: accordingly we went on board, took\r\nthe arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found\r\nthere, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few\r\nbiscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of\r\ncanvass (the sugar was five or six pounds;) all which was very welcome\r\nto me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had none left for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore, (the oars, mast, sail,\r\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before, as above,) we knocked a\r\ngreat hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master\r\nus, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my\r\nthoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,\r\nthat if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to make\r\nher fit again to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our\r\nfriends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them still in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\r\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach so high, that the tide would\r\nnot float her off at high water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in\r\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what\r\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with\r\nher ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no boat\r\nstirred; and they fired several times, making other signals for the\r\nboat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and\r\nthey found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my\r\nglasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and we\r\nfound, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men in her;\r\nand that they had fire-arms with them.\r\n\r\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of\r\nthem as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the\r\ntide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed\r\nup under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed,\r\nand where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view of\r\nthem, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in\r\nthe boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who,\r\nhe was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being\r\noverpowered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who, it\r\nseems, was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were as\r\noutrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate\r\nin their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they\r\nwould be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in\r\nour circumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost\r\nevery condition that could be was better than that which we were\r\nsupposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether\r\ndeath or life, would be sure to be a deliverance, I asked him what he\r\nthought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were\r\nnot worth venturing for? \"And where, Sir,\" said I, \"is your belief of my\r\nbeing preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a\r\nlittle while ago? For my part,\" said I, \"there seems to me but one thing\r\namiss in all the prospect of it.\"--\"What is that?\" says he. \"Why,\" said\r\nI, \"it is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among\r\nthem, which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of\r\nthe crew I should have thought God's providence had singled them out to\r\ndeliver them into your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes\r\nashore are our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.\" As I\r\nspoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it\r\ngreatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.\r\n\r\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming from the ship,\r\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them\r\neffectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than\r\nordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my\r\ncave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or\r\ndiscovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have\r\ndelivered themselves: here they left them bound, but gave them\r\nprovisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give\r\nthem their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their\r\nescape, they should be put to death without mercy. They promised\r\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\r\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\r\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\r\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood centinel over\r\nthem at the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\r\nindeed, because the captain was not free to trust them; but the other\r\ntwo were taken into my service, upon the captain's recommendation, and\r\nupon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and\r\nthe three honest men we were seven men well armed; and I made no doubt\r\nwe should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\r\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest\r\nmen among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other\r\nboat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore,\r\nhauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was\r\nafraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance\r\nfrom the shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should\r\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did,\r\nthey ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under\r\na great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her,\r\nand a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while upon this,\r\nthey set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might,\r\nto try if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no\r\npurpose: then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their\r\nsmall arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made the woods\r\nring; but it was all one; those in the cave we were sure could not hear,\r\nand those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst\r\ngive no answer to them. They were so astonished at the surprise of this,\r\nthat, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board\r\nagain, to their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered,\r\nand the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched their\r\nboat again, and got all of them on board.\r\n\r\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at this, believing\r\nthey would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their\r\ncomrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he\r\nwas in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much\r\nfrightened the other way.\r\n\r\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, but we perceived them all\r\ncoming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct, which\r\nit seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in the\r\nboat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look\r\nfor their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we\r\nwere at a loss what to do; as our seizing those seven men on shore would\r\nbe no advantage to us, if we let the boat escape; because they would\r\nthen row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to\r\nweigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.\r\nHowever, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things\r\nmight present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained\r\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to\r\nan anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at\r\nthem in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together, marching\r\ntowards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we\r\ncould see them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We could have\r\nbeen very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have\r\nfired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might\r\nhave come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where\r\nthey could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards\r\nthe north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and\r\nhallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to venture far\r\nfrom the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together under a\r\ntree, to consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep\r\nthere, as the other part of them had done, they had done the job for us;\r\nbut they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to\r\nsleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to\r\nfear neither.\r\n\r\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\r\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\r\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\r\nthem, just at the Juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\r\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I\r\nliked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to\r\ncome up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this\r\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what\r\ncourse to take. At length I told them there would be nothing done, in my\r\nopinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat,\r\nperhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so\r\nmight use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We\r\nwaited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were\r\nvery uneasy, when, after long consultations, we saw them all start up,\r\nand march down towards the sea: it seems they had such dreadful\r\napprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they resolved\r\nto go on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and\r\nso go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I imagined it to\r\nbe, as it really was, that they had given over their search, and were\r\nfor going back again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my\r\nthoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it: but I presently\r\nthought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my\r\nend to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the\r\nlittle creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore\r\nwhen Friday was rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising\r\nground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo out, as loud\r\nas they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as\r\nsoon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it\r\nagain; and then keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering\r\nwhen the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, and among\r\nthe woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways\r\nas I directed them.\r\n\r\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed:\r\nand they presently heard them, and answering, run along the shore\r\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were presently stopped\r\nby the creek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and\r\ncalled for the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I\r\nexpected. When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat\r\nbeing gone a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour\r\nwithin the land, they took one of the three men out of her, to go along\r\nwith them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to the\r\nstump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and\r\nimmediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I\r\ntook the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we\r\nsurprised the two men before they were aware; one of them lying on the\r\nshore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between\r\nsleeping and waking, and going to start up; the captain, who was\r\nforemost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to\r\nhim in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few\r\narguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon\r\nhim, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this was, it seems, one of\r\nthe three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew,\r\nand therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to\r\njoin very sincerely with us. In the mean time, Friday and the captain's\r\nmate so well managed their business with the rest, that they drew them,\r\nby hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood\r\nto another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where\r\nthey were very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was\r\ndark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time\r\nthey came back to us.\r\n\r\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\r\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours after\r\nFriday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could\r\nhear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to\r\nthose behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and\r\ncomplain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster;\r\nwhich was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat:\r\nbut it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat\r\nfast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.\r\nWe could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable manner,\r\ntelling one another they were got into an enchanted island; that either\r\nthere were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else\r\nthere were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away\r\nand devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by\r\ntheir names a great many times; but no answer. After some time, we could\r\nsee them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their\r\nhands like men in despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down\r\nin the boat, to rest themselves: then come ashore again, and walk about\r\nagain, and so the same thing over again. My men would fain have had me\r\ngive them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing\r\nto take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of\r\nthem as I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing\r\nany of our men, knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to\r\nwait, to see if they did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure of\r\nthem, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to\r\ncreep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could,\r\nthat they might not be discovered, and get as near them as they could\r\npossibly, before they offered to fire.\r\n\r\nThey had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was the\r\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\r\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with\r\ntwo more of the crew: the captain was so eager at having this principal\r\nrogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let\r\nhim come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue\r\nbefore: but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up\r\non their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot;\r\nthe next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did\r\nnot die till an hour or two after; and the third run for it. At the\r\nnoise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army,\r\nwhich was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my\r\nlieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners\r\nof war, whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the\r\ndark, so that they could not see our number; and I made the man they had\r\nleft in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if\r\nI could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to\r\nterms; which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was easy to\r\nthink, as their condition then was, they would be very willing to\r\ncapitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could, to one of them, \"Tom\r\nSmith! Tom Smith!\" Tom Smith answered immediately, \"Is that Robinson?\"\r\nFor it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, \"Aye aye; for God's\r\nsake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men\r\nthis moment.\"--\"Who must we yield to? Where are they?\" says Smith again.\r\n\"Here they are,\" says he; \"here's our captain and fifty men with him;\r\nhave been hunting you these two hours: the boatswain is killed, Will Fry\r\nis wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all\r\nlost.\"--\"Will they give us quarter then?\" says Tom Smith, \"and we will\r\nyield.\"--\"I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield,\" says Robinson: so\r\nhe asked the captain; and the captain himself then calls out, \"You,\r\nSmith, you know my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately, and\r\nsubmit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out, \"For God's sake, captain, give me\r\nquarter; what have I done? They have all been as bad as I:\" which, by\r\nthe way, was not true neither; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was the\r\nfirst man that laid hold of the captain, when they first mutinied, and\r\nused him barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious\r\nlanguage. However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at\r\ndiscretion, and trust to the governor's mercy: by which he meant, me,\r\nfor they all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down their\r\narms, and begged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with\r\nthem, and two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty\r\nmen, which, particularly with those three, were in all but eight, came\r\nup and seized upon them, and upon their boat; only that I kept myself\r\nand one more out of sight for reasons of state.\r\n\r\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and\r\nas for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\r\nexpostulated with them upon the villany of their practices with him, and\r\nat length upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly\r\nit must bring them to misery and, distress in the end, and perhaps to\r\nthe gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their\r\nlives. As for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but\r\nthe commander's of the island; that they thought they had set him on\r\nshore in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to\r\ndirect them, that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an\r\nEnglishman; that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he\r\nhad given them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England,\r\nto be dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\r\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\r\nwould be hanged in the morning.\r\n\r\nThough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\r\neffect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede with\r\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's\r\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\r\n\r\nIt now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was come, and\r\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\r\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\r\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\r\ncalled the captain to me: when I called, as at a good distance, one of\r\nthe men was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, \"Captain,\r\nthe commander calls for you;\" and presently the captain replied, \"Tell\r\nhis excellency I am just a coming.\" This more perfectly amused them, and\r\nthey all believed that the commander was just by with his fifty men.\r\nUpon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the\r\nship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in\r\nexecution the next morning. But, in order to execute it with more art,\r\nand to be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners,\r\nand that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of\r\nthem, and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was\r\ncommitted to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with the captain.\r\nThey conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a\r\ndismal place, especially to men in their condition. The others I\r\nordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full\r\ndescription; and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was\r\nsecure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.\r\n\r\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\r\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought\r\nthey might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. He\r\ntalked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they were\r\nbrought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for\r\ntheir lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to\r\nEngland, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if\r\nthey would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would\r\nhave the governor's engagement for their pardon.\r\n\r\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men\r\nin their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and\r\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\r\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and\r\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a\r\nfather as long as they lived. \"Well,\" says the captain, \"I must go and\r\ntell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to\r\nconsent to it.\" So he brought me an account of the temper he found them\r\nin, and that he verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we\r\nmight be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out\r\nthose five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that\r\nhe would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the\r\ngovernor would keep the other two, and the three that were sent\r\nprisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those\r\nfive; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five\r\nhostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This looked\r\nsevere, and convinced them that the governor was in earnest: however,\r\nthey had no way left them but to accept it; and it was now the business\r\nof the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five\r\nto do their duty.\r\n\r\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, The\r\ncaptain, his mate, and passenger: second, Then the two prisoners of the\r\nfirst gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had\r\ngiven their liberty, and trusted them with arms: third, The other two\r\nthat I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's\r\nmotion, had now released: fourth, These five released at last: so that\r\nthey were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave\r\nfor hostages.\r\n\r\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\r\nboard the ship: but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\r\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\r\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\r\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\r\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries; and\r\nI made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\r\nFriday was to take it.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\r\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them:\r\nand that it was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any where\r\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the\r\ncastle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see\r\nme as a governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\r\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\r\n\r\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\r\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\r\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\r\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well,\r\nfor they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within\r\ncall of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had\r\nbrought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before\r\nthey had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came\r\nto the ship's side; when the captain and the mate entering first, with\r\ntheir arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with\r\nthe but end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their\r\nmen; they secured all the rest that were upon the mainland quarterdecks,\r\nand began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below; when\r\nthe other boat and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the\r\nforecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the\r\ncook-room, making three men they found there prisoners. When this was\r\ndone, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three\r\nmen, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who\r\nhaving taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got\r\nfire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the\r\ndoor, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded\r\nthe mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more\r\nof the men, but killed nobody. The mate calling for help, rushed,\r\nhowever, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol\r\nshot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth,\r\nand came out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word\r\nmore: upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually,\r\nwithout any more lives lost.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the: captain ordered seven guns to\r\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\r\nhis success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat\r\nwatching upon the shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning.\r\nHaving thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been\r\na day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something\r\nsurprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a\r\nman call me by the name of Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the\r\ncaptain's voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he\r\nstood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. \"My dear\r\nfriend and deliverer,\" says he, \"there's your ship, for she is all\r\nyour's, and so are we, and all that belong to her.\" I cast my eyes to\r\nthe ship, and there she rode within little more than half a mile of the\r\nshore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of\r\nher, and the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just\r\nagainst the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the\r\ncaptain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I at first\r\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door, I was at first ready to\r\nsink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly\r\nput into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry\r\nme away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able\r\nto answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast\r\nby him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the\r\nsurprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me\r\na dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After I had\r\ndrank it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought me to\r\nmyself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All\r\nthis time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under\r\nany surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to\r\nme, to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the flood of joy in\r\nmy breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke\r\nout into tears; and in a little while after I recovered my speech. I\r\nthen took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced\r\ntogether. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to\r\ndeliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\r\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\r\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\r\neye of an infinite power could search into the remotest corner of the\r\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever he pleased. I forgot not\r\nto lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could\r\nforbear to bless him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided\r\nfor me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from\r\nwhom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed?\r\n\r\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\r\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\r\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this he\r\ncalled aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that\r\nwere for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been\r\none that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had been to\r\ndwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of bottles\r\nfull of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine,\r\n(the bottles held two quarts each,) two pounds of excellent good\r\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,\r\nwith a bag of peas, and about an hundred weight of biscuit: he also\r\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two\r\nbottles of lime juice, and abundance of other things. But, besides\r\nthese, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me\r\nsix new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one\r\npair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit\r\nof clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little; in a word,\r\nhe clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable\r\npresent, as any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never\r\nwas any thing in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and\r\nuneasy, as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.\r\n\r\nAfter these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were\r\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be\r\ndone with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we\r\nmight venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them,\r\nwhom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and\r\nthe captain said he knew they were such rogues, that there was no\r\nobliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as\r\nmalefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony\r\nhe could come at; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious\r\nabout it. Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would undertake\r\nto bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he\r\nshould leave them upon the island. \"I should be very glad of that,\" says\r\nthe captain, \"with all my heart.\"--\"Well,\" says I, \"I will send for\r\nthem up, and talk with them for you,\" So I caused Friday and the two\r\nhostages, for they were now discharged, their comrades having performed\r\ntheir promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the\r\nfive men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till\r\nI came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now\r\nI was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, I\r\ncaused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full\r\naccount of their villanous behaviour to the captain, and how they had\r\nrun away with the ship, and were, preparing to commit farther robberies,\r\nbut that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they\r\nwere fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know\r\nthat by my direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the\r\nroad; and they might see, by and by, that their new captain had received\r\nthe reward of his villany, and that they would see him hanging at the\r\nyard-arm: that as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I\r\nshould not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my\r\ncommission they could not doubt but I had authority so to do.\r\n\r\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\r\nsay but this, that when they were taken, the captain promised them their\r\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not\r\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\r\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for\r\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England\r\nother than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running\r\naway with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know,\r\nwould be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them,\r\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired\r\nthat, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to\r\ngive them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. They\r\nseemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to\r\nstay there than be carried to England to be hanged: so I left it on\r\nthat issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he\r\ndurst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\r\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\r\nseeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word;\r\nand that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at\r\nliberty, as I found them; and if he did not like it, he might take them\r\nagain if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared very thankful, and\r\nI accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods\r\nto the place whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-arms,\r\nsome ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well, if\r\nthey thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told\r\nthe captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired\r\nhim to go on board, in the mean time, and keep all right in the ship,\r\nand send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events,\r\nto cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm,\r\nthat these men might see him.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\r\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances. I\r\ntold them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\r\nhad carried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the\r\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\r\nnothing less to expect.\r\n\r\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them I\r\nwould let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the\r\nway of making it easy to them: accordingly, I gave them the whole\r\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\r\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\r\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told\r\nthem the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected,\r\nfor whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common\r\nwith themselves. Here it may be noted, that the captain had ink on\r\nboard, who was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of making\r\nink of charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done things\r\nmuch more difficult.\r\n\r\nI left them my fire-arms, viz. five-muskets, three fowling-pieces; and\r\nthree swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after\r\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a\r\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\r\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a word, I gave them\r\nevery part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the\r\ncaptain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden\r\nseeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of: also I gave\r\nthem the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade\r\nthem be sure to sow and increase them.\r\n\r\nHaving done all this, I left them the next day, and went on board the\r\nship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The\r\nnext morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship's\r\nside, and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged\r\nto be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be murdered,\r\nand begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them\r\nimmediately. Upon this, the captain pretended to have no power without\r\nme; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of\r\namendment, they were taken on board, and were some time after soundly\r\nwhipped and pickled: after which they proved very honest and\r\nquiet fellows.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\r\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\r\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\r\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling\r\nthem that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I\r\nwould not forget them.\r\n\r\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for reliques, the\r\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also\r\nI forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by\r\nme so long useless, that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could\r\nhardly pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled; as\r\nalso the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I left\r\nthe island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship's account, in\r\nthe year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty years, two\r\nmonths, and nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity\r\nthe same day of the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat,\r\nfrom among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I\r\narrived in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been\r\nthirty-five years absent.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as\r\nif I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward,\r\nwhom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great\r\nmisfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very\r\nlow in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring\r\nher I would give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude for\r\nher former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my\r\nlittle-stock would afford; which, at that time, would indeed allow me to\r\ndo but little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former\r\nkindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her,\r\nas shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterwards into\r\nYorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family\r\nextinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of one\r\nof my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there\r\nhad been no provision made for me: so that, in a word, I found nothing\r\nto relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would not do\r\nmuch for me as to settling in the world.\r\n\r\nI met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and\r\nthis was, that the master of the ship whom I had so happily delivered,\r\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\r\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives\r\nof the men, and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other\r\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment\r\nupon the subject, and a present of almost £200 sterling.\r\n\r\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\r\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\r\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some\r\ninformation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what\r\nwas become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years\r\npast given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,\r\nwhere I arrived in April following; my man Friday accompanying me very\r\nhonestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant\r\nupon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and\r\nto my particular satisfaction, my old friend the captain of the ship who\r\nfirst took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old,\r\nand had left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a\r\nyoung man, into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old\r\nman did not know me; and, indeed, I hardly knew him: but I soon brought\r\nhim to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance,\r\nwhen I told him who I was.\r\n\r\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\r\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old\r\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but\r\nthat he could assure me, that when he came away my partner was living;\r\nbut the trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my\r\npart, were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very\r\ngood account of the improvement of the plantation; for that upon the\r\ngeneral belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given\r\nin the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the\r\nprocurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to\r\nclaim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St.\r\nAugustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the\r\nconversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared,\r\nor any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only\r\nthat the improvement or annual production, being distributed to\r\ncharitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured me that the\r\nsteward of the king's revenue from lands, and the provedore, or steward\r\nof the monastery, had taken great care all along that the incumbent,\r\nthat is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithful account of the\r\nproduce, of which they had duly received my moiety. I asked him if he\r\nknew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation, and\r\nwhether he thought it might be worth looking after; or whether, on my\r\ngoing thither, I should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my\r\njust right in the moiety. He told me he could not tell exactly to what\r\ndegree the plantation was improved; but this he knew, that my partner\r\nwas grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it; and that, to\r\nthe best of his remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my\r\npart, which was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery or\r\nreligious house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year: that as\r\nto my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question\r\nto be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my\r\nname being also enrolled in the register of the country; also he told\r\nme, that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair honest people,\r\nand very wealthy; and he believed I would hot only have their assistance\r\nfor putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of\r\nmoney in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm while\r\ntheir fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as above;\r\nwhich, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\r\n\r\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\r\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should\r\nthus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and\r\nhad made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\r\n\r\nHe told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\r\ndead, he could not act as executor, until some certain account should\r\ncome of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a\r\nthing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in\r\nhis claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or\r\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the\r\ningeino, (so they called the sugar-house) and have given his son, who\r\nwas now at the Brazils, orders to do it. \"But,\" says the old man, \"I\r\nhave one piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so\r\nacceptable to you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and\r\nall the world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to\r\naccount with me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years'\r\nprofits, which I received. There being at that time great disbursements\r\nfor increasing the works, building an ingeino, and buying slaves, it did\r\nnot amount to near so much as afterwards it produced: however,\" says the\r\nold man, \"I shall give you a true account of what I have received in\r\nall, and how I have disposed of it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend, he\r\nbrought me an account of the first six years' income of my plantation,\r\nsigned by my partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered\r\nin goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum,\r\nmolasses, &c. which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found, by\r\nthis account, that every year the income considerably increased; but, as\r\nabove, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small:\r\nhowever, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred\r\nand seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen\r\ndouble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been\r\nshipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving\r\nthe place. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and\r\nhow he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses,\r\nand buy him a share in a new ship. \"However, my old friend,\" says he,\r\n\"you shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son\r\nreturns, you shall be fully satisfied.\" Upon this, he pulls out an old\r\npouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and\r\ngiving the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to\r\nthe Brazils in, of which he was a quarter-part owner, and his son\r\nanother, he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest.\r\n\r\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be\r\nable to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had\r\ntaken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions,\r\nand particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly\r\nrefrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if his\r\ncircumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if\r\nit would not straiten him? He told me he could not say but it might\r\nstraiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might want\r\nit more than he.\r\n\r\nEvery thing the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\r\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\r\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\r\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\r\nthe plantation, I would return the other to him also, (as, indeed, I\r\nafterwards did;) and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his\r\nson's ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the\r\nmoney, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but\r\ncame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a\r\npenny more from him.\r\n\r\nWhen this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a\r\nmethod to make my claim to my plantation? I told him I thought to go\r\nover to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased; but that if I did\r\nnot, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\r\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\r\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a\r\npublic register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\r\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\r\nplanting the said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by\r\na notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a\r\nletter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;\r\nand then proposed my staying with him till an account came of\r\nthe return.\r\n\r\nNever was any thing more honourable than the proceedings upon this\r\nprocuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet\r\nfrom the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I\r\nwent to sea, in which were the following particular letters and\r\npapers enclosed.\r\n\r\nFirst, There was the account-current of the produce of my farm or\r\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old\r\nPortugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one\r\nthousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.\r\n\r\nSecondly, There was the account of four years more, while they kept the\r\neffects in their hands, before the government claimed the\r\nadministration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which\r\nthey called civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the\r\nplantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and\r\nforty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and\r\nforty moidores.\r\n\r\nThirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's account, who had received\r\nthe profits for above fourteen years; but not being to account for what\r\nwas disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight\r\nhundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged\r\nto my account: as to the king's part, that refunded nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very\r\naffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate\r\nwas improved, and what it produced a year; with a particular of the\r\nnumber of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, how many\r\nslaves there were upon it, and making two and twenty crosses for\r\nblessings, told me he had said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the blessed\r\nVirgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and\r\ntake possession of my own; and, in the mean time, to give him orders to\r\nwhom he should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; concluding\r\nwith a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent\r\nme, as a present, seven fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems,\r\nreceived from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and\r\nwho, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five\r\nchests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined,\r\nnot quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet, my two\r\nmerchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar,\r\neight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account\r\nin gold.\r\n\r\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than\r\nthe beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very\r\nheart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come\r\nall in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods:\r\nand the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my\r\nhand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the old man\r\nrun and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had\r\noverset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that, I\r\ncontinued very ill, and was so some hours till a physician being sent\r\nfor, and something of the real cause of my illness being known, he\r\nordered me to be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: but\r\nI verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner\r\nto the spirits, I should have died.\r\n\r\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds\r\nsterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the\r\nBrazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of\r\nlands in England; and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce\r\nknew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of\r\nit. The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my\r\ngood old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress,\r\nkind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him\r\nall that was sent to me; I told him, that next to the providence of\r\nHeaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now\r\nlay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundredfold: so I first\r\nreturned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent\r\nfor a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge\r\nfrom the four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he\r\nowed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which I\r\ncaused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of\r\nthe annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to\r\naccount with him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my\r\nname; and a clause in the end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a\r\nyear to him during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a\r\nyear to his son after him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.\r\n\r\nI was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do\r\nwith the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,\r\nI had more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state of life\r\nin the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing\r\nbut what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my\r\nbusiness was how to secure it. I had never a cave now to hide my money\r\nin, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew\r\nmouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle with it: on the\r\ncontrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old\r\npatron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I\r\nhad. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me\r\nthither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I\r\nhad settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind\r\nme. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was\r\nhonest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but\r\npoor, and, for aught. I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, I\r\nhad no way but to go back to England myself, and take my effects\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and therefore,\r\nas I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who\r\nhad been my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor widow,\r\nwhose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her\r\npower, my faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I\r\ngot a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not\r\nonly to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money a\r\nhundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her\r\npoverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply:\r\nat the same time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds,\r\neach, they being, though not in want, yet not in very good\r\ncircumstances; one having been married and left a widow; and the other\r\nhaving a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But among all my\r\nrelations or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I\r\ndurst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to the\r\nBrazils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.\r\n\r\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled myself\r\nthere, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place; but I had some\r\nlittle scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back.\r\nHowever, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the\r\npresent; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of\r\nthe country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only\r\nthat, now and then, having of late thought more of it than formerly,\r\nwhen I began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret\r\nmy having professed myself a papist, and thought it might not be the\r\nbest religion to die with.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going\r\nto the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my\r\neffects behind me; so I resolved, at last, to go to England with it,\r\nwhere, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or\r\nfind some relations that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I\r\nprepared to go to England with all my wealth.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare tilings for my going home, I first, the Brazil fleet\r\nbeing just going away, resolved to give answers suitable to the just and\r\nfaithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the prior\r\nof St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for their just\r\ndealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores\r\nwhich were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred\r\nto the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the\r\nprior should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the\r\nlike. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the\r\nacknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for; as for\r\nsending them any present, they were far above having any occasion for\r\nit. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the\r\nimproving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of\r\nthe, works; giving him instructions for his future government of my\r\npart, according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I\r\ndesired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from\r\nme more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to\r\ncome to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To\r\nthis I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife\r\nand two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with\r\ntwo pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon,\r\nfive pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value.\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects\r\ninto good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was, which way to go to\r\nEngland: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a\r\nstrange aversion to go to England by sea at that time; and though I\r\ncould give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so\r\nmuch, that though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I\r\naltered my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.\r\n\r\nIt is true; I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be some\r\nof the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own\r\nthoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled\r\nout to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other,\r\nhaving put my things on board one of them, and in the other to have\r\nagreed with the captain; I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one\r\nwas taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start,\r\nnear Torbay, and all the people drowned, except three; so that in either\r\nof those vessels I had been made miserable.\r\n\r\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I\r\ncommunicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but\r\neither to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to\r\nRochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to\r\nParis, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the\r\nway by laud through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed against my\r\ngoing by sea at all, except from Calas to Dover, that I resolved to\r\ntravel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not\r\nvalue the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to make it more\r\nso, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant\r\nin Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up\r\ntwo more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the\r\nlast going to Paris only; so that in all there were six of us, and five\r\nservants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves\r\nwith one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got\r\nan English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday,\r\nwho was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a\r\nservant on the road.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well\r\nmounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the\r\nhonour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as\r\nbecause I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original of the\r\nwhole journey.\r\n\r\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble\r\nyou now with none of my land journal; but some adventures that happened\r\nto us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, were\r\nwilling to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and to see what was\r\nworth observing; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened\r\naway, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we\r\ncame to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the\r\nway, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of\r\nthe mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to\r\nPampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me, that\r\nhad been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could\r\nscarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was\r\nit more painful than surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old\r\nCastile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and\r\nimmediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so\r\nseverely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and\r\nperishing of our fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered\r\nwith snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before\r\nin his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued\r\nsnowing with so much violence, and so long, that the people said winter\r\nwas come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before,\r\nwere now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places\r\ntoo thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in\r\nthe northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of\r\nbeing buried alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at\r\nPampeluna; when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its\r\nbeing better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had\r\nbeen known in the memory of man, I proposed that we should all go away\r\nto Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very\r\nlittle voyage. But while I was considering this, there came in four\r\nFrench gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French side of the\r\npasses, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who,\r\ntraversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over\r\nthe mountains by such ways, that they were not much incommoded with the\r\nsnow; for where they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was\r\nfrozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We sent, for this\r\nguide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same way with no\r\nhazard from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect\r\nourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, upon these great snows it was\r\nfrequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the\r\nmountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being\r\ncovered with snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such\r\ncreatures as they were, if he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged\r\nwolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger from, especially on\r\nthe French side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no\r\ndanger of that kind in the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed\r\nto follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants,\r\nsome French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were\r\nobliged to come back again.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, on the 15th of\r\nNovember; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going forward,\r\nhe came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,\r\nabout twenty miles; when having passed two rivers, and come into the\r\nplain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the\r\ncountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turning\r\nto his left, he approached the mountains another way: and though it is\r\ntrue the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many\r\ntours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we\r\ninsensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much\r\nencumbered with the snow; and, all on a sudden, he showed us the\r\npleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and\r\nflourishing, though, indeed, at a great distance, and we had some rough\r\nway to pass still.\r\n\r\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day\r\nand a night so fast, that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we\r\nshould soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend\r\nevery day, and to come more north than before; and so depending upon our\r\nguide, we went on.\r\n\r\nIt was about two hours before night, when our guide being something\r\nbefore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and\r\nafter them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood: two of\r\nthe wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would\r\nhave been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them fastened\r\nupon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that violence, that\r\nhe had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but\r\nhallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next me,\r\nI bade him ride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came\r\nin sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, \"O master! O\r\nmaster!\" but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and\r\nwith his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the head.\r\n\r\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for he having\r\nbeen used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but\r\nwent close up to him and shot him, as above; whereas any other of us\r\nwould have fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed\r\nthe wolf, or endangered shooting the man.\r\n\r\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it\r\nalarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we\r\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\r\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\r\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few\r\nas that we had no cause of apprehensions: however, as Friday had killed\r\nthis wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him\r\nimmediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily\r\nfastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his\r\nteeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him\r\ntwice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and\r\nthough he had made some defence, he was just as it were tumbling down by\r\nthe disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mended\r\nour pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult,\r\nwould give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we came\r\nclear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had\r\nbeen the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we\r\ndid not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.\r\n\r\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising\r\nmanner, as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave\r\nus all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the\r\ngreatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy clumsy creature,\r\nand does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has\r\ntwo particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions:\r\nfirst, as to men, who are not his proper prey, (he does not usually\r\nattempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessive\r\nhungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being\r\ncovered with snow,) if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle\r\nwith you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give\r\nhim the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out\r\nof his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is\r\nto look another way, and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and\r\nstand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront;\r\nbut if you throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him, though it\r\nwere but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused,\r\nand sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have\r\nsatisfaction in point of honour;--this is his first quality: the next\r\nis, if he be once affronted, he will never leave yon, night nor day,\r\ntill he has his revenge, but follows, at a good round rate, till he\r\novertakes yon.\r\n\r\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he\r\nwas helping him off from his horse, for the man was both hurt and\r\nfrightened, when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out of the wood,\r\nand a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We\r\nwere all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him,\r\nit was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance: \"O, O,\r\nO!\" says Friday, three times, pointing to him; \"O master! you give me\r\nte leave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased; \"You fool,\" says I,\r\n\"he will eat you up,\"--\"Eatee me up! eatee me up!\" says Friday, twice\r\nover again; \"me eatee him up; me' makee you good laugh; you all stay\r\nhere, me show you good laugh.\" So down he sits, and gets off his boots\r\nin a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps, (as we call the flat shoes\r\nthey wear, and which he had in his pocket,) gives my other servant his\r\nhorse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.\r\n\r\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till\r\nFriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand\r\nhim, \"Hark ye, hark ye,\" says Friday, \"me speakee with you.\" We followed\r\nat a distance; for now being come down on the Gaseony side of the\r\nmountains, we were entered a vast great forest, where the country was\r\nplain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and\r\nthere. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with\r\nhim quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws it at him, and hit\r\nhim just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it\r\nagainst a wall; but it answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void\r\nof fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us\r\nsome laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw\r\nhim, he turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides,\r\nand shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a\r\nmiddling gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run\r\ntowards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear,\r\nand deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the\r\nbear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another way:\r\nand especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then\r\nrun away; and I called out, \"You dog, is this your making us laugh? Come\r\naway, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.\" He heard me,\r\nand cried out, \"No shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get much\r\nlaugh:\" and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear's one, he\r\nturned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit\r\nfor his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he\r\ngets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about\r\nfive or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the\r\ntree, and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did, he stopped\r\nat the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the\r\ntree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at\r\nthe folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see any\r\nthing to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode\r\nnear to him.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a\r\nlarge branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the\r\nbear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker,--\"Ha!\"\r\nsays he to us, \"now you see me teachee the bear dance:\" so he falls a\r\njumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but\r\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get\r\nback; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with\r\nhim by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he calls out to him\r\nagain, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, \"What, you\r\ncome no farther? pray you come farther:\" so he left jumping and shaking\r\nthe tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come\r\na little farther; then he fell a jumping again, and the bear stopped\r\nagain. We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and\r\ncalled to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear: but he\r\ncried out earnestly, \"O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then;\"\r\nhe would have said by and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday\r\ndanced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing\r\nenough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first\r\nwe thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear\r\nwas too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be\r\nthrown down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and feet, so\r\nthat we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest\r\nwould be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the\r\nbear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come\r\nany farther, \"Well, well,\" says Friday, \"you no come farther, me go; you\r\nno come to me, me come to you:\" and upon this he goes out to the smaller\r\nend of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets\r\nhimself down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came near enough to\r\njump down on his feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it up, and\r\nstands still. \"Well,\" said I to him, \"Friday, what will you do now? Why\r\ndon't you shoot him?\"--\"No shoot,\" says Friday, \"no yet; me shoot now,\r\nme no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:\" and, indeed, so he did,\r\nas you will see presently; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he\r\ncomes back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty cautiously,\r\nlooking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into the\r\nbody of the tree; then with the same hinder end foremost, he came down\r\nthe tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time,\r\nvery leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind\r\nfoot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle\r\nof his piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned\r\nabout to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased, by\r\nour looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud. \"So we kill bear in\r\nmy country,\" says Friday. \"So you kill them?\" says I: \"why, you have no\r\nguns.\"--\"No,\" says he, \"no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.\" This\r\nwas a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our\r\nguide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling of\r\nwolves ran much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard\r\non the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never\r\nheard any thing that filled me with so much horror.\r\n\r\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as\r\nFriday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of\r\nthis monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near\r\nthree leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went\r\nforward on our journey.\r\n\r\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous\r\nas on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,\r\nwere come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to\r\nseek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages,\r\nwhere they surprised the country people, killed a great many of their\r\nsheep and horses, and some people too. We had one dangerous place to\r\npass, which our guide told us, if there were more wolves in the country\r\nwe should find them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded with\r\nwoods on every side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to\r\npass to get through the wood, and then we should come to the village\r\nwhere we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we\r\nentered the first wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the\r\nplain; we met with nothing in the first wood, except that, in a little\r\nplain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw\r\nfive great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if\r\nthey had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took no\r\nnotice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon this our\r\nguide, who, by the way, was but a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a\r\nready posture, for he believed there were more wolves a coming. We kept\r\nour arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we\r\ncame through that wood, which was near half a league, and entered the\r\nplain. As soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look\r\nabout us: the first object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say,\r\na poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them\r\nat work, we could not say eating of him, but picking of his bones\r\nrather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit\r\nto disturb them at their feast, neither did they take much notice of us.\r\nFriday would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any\r\nmeans; for I found we were like to have more business upon our hands\r\nthan we were aware of. We were not gone half over the plain, when we\r\nbegan to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful\r\nmanner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly\r\ntowards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as\r\nan army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner\r\nto receive them, but found, to draw ourselves in a close line was the\r\nonly way; so we formed in a moment: but that we might not have, too\r\nmuch interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that\r\nthe others who had not fired should stand ready to give them a second\r\nvolley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that\r\nthose who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees\r\nagain, but stand ready every one with a pistol, for we were all armed\r\nwith a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method,\r\nable to fire six volleys, half of us at a time: however, at present we\r\nhad no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a\r\nfull stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire; four\r\nof them being shot in the head, dropped; several others were wounded,\r\nand went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I found they\r\nstopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that I\r\nhad been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of\r\na man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as we could; and I\r\nfound the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began\r\nto retire, and turn about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in\r\ntheir rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the\r\nwoods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we\r\nmight lose no time, we kept going: but we had but little more than\r\nloaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a\r\nterrible noise in the same wood, on our left, only that it was farther\r\nonward, the same way we were to go.\r\n\r\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\r\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\r\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and, on\r\na sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left,\r\none behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded\r\nwith them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way\r\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being\r\nvery rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of\r\nthe entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther\r\nside of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the\r\nlane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the\r\nentrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the\r\nnoise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle\r\nand a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen\r\nwolves after him, full speed; indeed the horse had the heels of them,\r\nbut as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted\r\nnot but they would get up with him at last; no question but they did.\r\n\r\nBut here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\r\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and of\r\ntwo men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no\r\ndoubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by\r\nhim fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his\r\nbody were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what\r\ncourse to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered\r\nabout us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were\r\nthree hundred of them. It happened very much to our advantage, that at\r\nthe entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some\r\nlarge timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I\r\nsuppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those\r\ntrees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised\r\nthem all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to\r\nstand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the\r\ncentre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious\r\ncharge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with\r\na growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I\r\nsaid, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey;\r\nand this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their\r\nseeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every\r\nother man; and they took their aim so sure, that they killed several of\r\nthe wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a\r\ncontinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on\r\nthose before.\r\n\r\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped\r\na little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but a moment,\r\nfor others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols;\r\nand I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen\r\nof them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to\r\nspend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday,\r\nfor he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable,\r\nhe had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged; but, as I\r\nsaid, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him\r\nlay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train.\r\nHe did so; and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to\r\nit, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to\r\nthe powder, set it on fire: those that were upon the timber were\r\nscorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in\r\namong us, with the force and fright of the fire; we dispatched these in\r\nan instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the\r\nnight, for it was now very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew\r\nback a little; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in\r\none volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this the wolves turned\r\ntail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones, that we\r\nfound struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with our\r\nswords, which answered our expectation; for the crying and howling they\r\nmade was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled\r\nand left us.\r\n\r\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and had it been\r\ndaylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus\r\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go. We\r\nheard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went,\r\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the\r\nsnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour more we\r\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible\r\nfright, and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before, the wolves and\r\nsome bears had broke into the village, and put them in such terror, that\r\nthey were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the\r\nnight, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their people.\r\n\r\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much\r\nwith the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we\r\nwere obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Thoulouse, where we\r\nfound a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, and no snow, no\r\nwolves, nor any thing like them: but when we told our story at\r\nThoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the\r\ngreat forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay\r\non the ground; but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had got,\r\nwho would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season; and told\r\nus it was surprising we were not all devoured. When we told them how we\r\nplaced ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us\r\nexceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all\r\ndestroyed; for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so\r\nfurious, seeing their prey; and that, at other times, they are really\r\nafraid of a gun; but being excessive hungry, and raging on that account,\r\nthe eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger;\r\nand that if we had not, by the continued fire, and at last by the\r\nstratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds\r\nbut that we had been torn to pieces: whereas, had we been content to\r\nhave sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have\r\ntaken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as\r\notherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood all\r\ntogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have\r\ndevoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having our\r\nfire-arms in our hands, and being so many in number. For my part, I was\r\nnever so sensible of danger in my life; for seeing above three hundred\r\ndevils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to\r\nshelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was,\r\nI believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again; I think I\r\nwould much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to\r\nmeet with a storm once a week.\r\n\r\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through France,\r\nnothing but what other travellers have given an account of, with much\r\nmore advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouse to Paris, and\r\nwithout any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover,\r\nthe 14th of Jan. after having a severe cold season to travel in.\r\n\r\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all\r\nmy new-discovered estate safe about me; the bills of exchange which I\r\nbrought with me having been very currently paid.\r\n\r\nMy principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient widow; who,\r\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much,\r\nnor care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with\r\nevery thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects:\r\nand, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in\r\nthe unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nAnd now having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\r\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon; who having offered it to the two\r\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\r\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces-of-eight\r\nto a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\r\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\r\nexchange for 32,800 pieces-of-eight for the estate; reserving the\r\npayment of 100 moidores a year to him (the old man) during his life, and\r\n50 moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I had promised\r\nthem; and which the plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And\r\nthus I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a\r\nlife of Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will\r\nseldom be able to show the like of: beginning foolishly, but closing\r\nmuch more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as\r\nto hope for.\r\n\r\nAny one would think, that in this state of complicated good fortune, I\r\nwas past running any more hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other\r\ncircumstances had concurred: but I was inured to a wandering life, had\r\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted much\r\nacquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I\r\ncould not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be\r\nupon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\r\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\r\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\r\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that, for almost seven years, she\r\nprevented my running abroad; during which time I took my two nephews,\r\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest having\r\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\r\nsettlement of some addition to his estate, after my decease. The other I\r\nput out to a captain of a ship: and after five years, finding him a\r\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\r\nand sent him to sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old\r\nas I was, to farther adventures myself.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\r\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\r\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and my\r\nnephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\r\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\r\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies: this was in\r\nthe year 1694.\r\n\r\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\r\nthe Spaniards, had the whole story of their lives, and of the villains I\r\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\r\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\r\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\r\nsubjected to the Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards used them; an\r\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\r\naccidents as my own part: particularly also as to their battles with the\r\nCaribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\r\nimprovement they made upon the island itself; and how five of them made\r\nan attempt upon the main land, and brought away eleven men and five\r\nwomen prisoners; by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\r\nchildren on the island.\r\n\r\nHere I stayed about twenty days; left them supplies of all necessary\r\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\r\nworkmen, which I brought from England with me; viz. a carpenter and\r\na smith.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\r\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively,\r\nas they agreed on; and, having settled all things with them, and engaged\r\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.\r\n\r\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\r\nI bought there, with more people, to the island; and in it, besides\r\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\r\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\r\nI promised them to send them some women from England, with a good cargo\r\nof necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting; which I\r\nafterwards could not perform: the fellows proved very honest and\r\ndiligent, after they were mastered, and had their properties set apart\r\nfor them. I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of them\r\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which, when I came again\r\nwere considerably increased.\r\n\r\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\r\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with\r\nthat whole number twice, and were at first defeated and one of them\r\nkilled; but at last a storm destroying their enemies canoes, they\r\nfamished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the\r\npossession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island.\r\n\r\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\r\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther account\r\nof in another volume.\r\n\r\nEND OF, VOL.I.",
