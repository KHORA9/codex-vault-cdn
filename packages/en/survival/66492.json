Although from the earliest dawn of history, men\r\nhad been familiar with the stupendous events of volcanic eruptions,\r\nthey were singularly slow in recognizing these phenomena as definite\r\nand important parts of the natural history of the earth. Even within\r\nthe present century, the dominant geological school in Europe\r\ntaught that volcanoes were mere accidents, due to the combustion of\r\nsubterranean beds of coal casually set on fire by lightning, or by the\r\ndecomposition of pyrites. Burning mountains, as they were called, were\r\nbelieved to be only local and fortuitous appearances, depending on the\r\nposition of the coal-fields, and having no essential connection with\r\nthe internal structure and past condition of our planet. So long as\r\nsuch fantastic conceptions prevailed, it was impossible that any solid\r\nprogress could be made in this branch of science. A juster appreciation\r\nof the nature of the earth's interior was needed before men could\r\nrecognize that volcanic action had once been vigorous and prolonged in\r\nmany countries, where no remains of volcanoes can now be seen.\r\n\r\nTo France, which has led the way in so many departments of human\r\ninquiry, belongs the merit of having laid the foundations of the\r\nsystematic study of ancient volcanoes. Her groups of Puys furnished the\r\nearliest inspiration in this subject, and have ever since been classic\r\nground to which the geological pilgrim has made his way from all\r\nparts of the world. As far back as the year 1752, Guettard recognised\r\nthat these marvellous hills were volcanic cones that had poured forth\r\nstreams of lava. But it was reserved for Desmarest twelve years later\r\nto examine the question in detail, and to establish the investigation\r\nof former volcanic action upon a broad and firm basis of careful\r\nobservation and sagacious inference. His method of research was as\r\nwell conceived as the region of Auvergne was admirably fitted to be\r\nthe field of exploration. He soon discovered that the volcanoes of\r\nCentral France were not all of one age, but had made their appearance\r\nin a long series, whereof the individual members became less perfect\r\nand distinct in proportion to their antiquity. Beginning with the\r\ncones, craters, and lava-streams which stand out so fresh that they\r\nmight almost be supposed to have been erupted only a few generations\r\nago, Desmarest traced the volcanic series backward in time, through\r\nsuccessive stages of the decay and degradation wrought upon them by\r\nthe influence of the atmosphere, rain and running water. He was thus\r\nable, as it were, to watch the gradual obliteration of the cones, the\r\nremoval of the ashes and scoriæ, and the erosion of the lava-streams,\r\nuntil he could point to mere isolated remnants of lava, perched upon\r\nthe hills, and overlooking the valleys which had been excavated through\r\nthem. He showed how every step in this process of denudation could be\r\nillustrated by examples of its occurrence in Auvergne, and how, in this\r\nway, the various eruptions could be grouped according to their place in\r\nthe chronological sequence. To this illustrious Frenchman geology is\r\nthus indebted, not only for the foundation of the scientific study of\r\nformer volcanic action, but for the first carefully worked out example\r\nof the potency of subærial erosion in the excavation of valleys and the\r\ntransformation of the scenery of the land.\r\n\r\nWhile these fruitful researches were in progress in France, others of\r\nhardly less moment were advancing in Scotland. There likewise Nature\r\nhad provided ample material to arrest the attention of all who cared\r\nto make themselves acquainted with the past history of our globe.\r\nHutton, as a part of his immortal _Theory of the Earth_, had conceived\r\nthe idea that much molten material had been injected from below into\r\nthe terrestrial crust, and he had found many proofs of such intrusion\r\namong the rocks alike of the Lowlands and Highlands of his native\r\ncountry. His observations, confirmed and extended by Playfair and Hall,\r\nand subsequently by Macculloch, opened up the investigation of the\r\nsubterranean phases of ancient volcanic action.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these great pioneers, volcanic geology would\r\nhave made steady and perhaps rapid progress in the later decades\r\nof last century, and the earlier years of the present, but for the\r\ntheoretical views unfortunately adopted by Werner. That illustrious\r\nteacher, to whom volcanoes seemed to be a blot on the system of\r\nnature which he had devised, did all in his power to depreciate their\r\nimportance. Adopting the old and absurd notion that they were caused\r\nby the combustion of coal under ground, he laboured to show that they\r\nwere mere modern accidents, and had no connection with his universal\r\nformations. He proclaimed, as an obvious axiom in science, that the\r\nbasalts, so widely spread over Central and Western Europe, and which\r\nthe observations of Desmarest had shown to mark the sites of old\r\nvolcanoes, were really chemical precipitates from a primeval universal\r\nocean. Yet he had actually before him in Saxony examples of basalt\r\nhills which entirely disprove his assertions.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the progress of natural knowledge, Werner disliked the\r\nmanual labour of penmanship. Consequently he wrote little. But his\r\nwide range of acquirement, not in mineralogy only, his precision of\r\nstatement, his absolute certainty about the truth of his own opinions,\r\nand his hardly disguised contempt for opinions that differed from them,\r\ncombined with his enthusiasm, eloquence and personal charm, fired\r\nhis pupils with emulation of his zeal and turned them into veritable\r\npropagandists. Misled as to the structure of the country in which\r\ntheir master taught, and undisciplined to investigate nature with an\r\nimpartial mind, they travelled into other lands for the purpose of\r\napplying there the artificial system which they had learnt at Freiberg.\r\nThe methodical but cumbrous terminology in which Werner had trained\r\nthem was translated by them into their own languages, where it looked\r\nstill more uncouth than in its native German. Besides imbibing their\r\nteacher's system, they acquired and even improved upon his somewhat\r\ndisdainful manner towards all conclusions different from those of the\r\nSaxon Mining School.\r\n\r\nSuch was the spirit in which the pupils of Werner proceeded to set the\r\n\"geognosy\" of Europe to rights. The views, announced by Desmarest,\r\nthat various rocks, far removed from any active volcano, were yet of\r\nvolcanic origin, had been slowly gaining ground when the militant\r\nstudents from Saxony spread themselves over the Continent. These views,\r\nhowever, being irreconcilable with the tenets enunciated from the\r\nFreiberg Chair, were now either ignored or contemptuously rejected.\r\nWerner's disciples loved to call themselves by their teacher's term\r\n\"geognosts,\" and claimed that they confined themselves to the strict\r\ninvestigation of fact with regard to the structure of the earth, in\r\napparent unconsciousness that their terminology and methods were\r\nfounded on baseless assumptions and almost puerile hypotheses.\r\n\r\nWith such elements ready for controversy, it was no wonder that before\r\nlong a battle arose over the origin of basalt and the part played by\r\nvolcanoes in the past history of the globe. The disciples of Werner,\r\nchampions of a universal ocean and the deposition of everything from\r\nwater, were dubbed Neptunists, while their opponents, equally stubborn\r\nin defence of the potency of volcanic fire, were known as Vulcanists or\r\nPlutonists. For more than a generation this futile warfare was waged\r\nwith extraordinary bitterness--dogmatism and authority doing their best\r\nto stop the progress of impartial observation and honest opinion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable incidents in the campaign is to be found in\r\nthe way in which the tide of battle was at last turned against the\r\nWernerians. Cuvier tells us that when some of the ardent upholders of\r\nthe Freiberg faith came to consult Desmarest, the old man, who took\r\nno part in the fray, would only answer, \"Go and see.\" He felt that in\r\nhis memoir and maps he had demonstrated the truth of his conclusions,\r\nand that an unprejudiced observer had only to visit Auvergne to be\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nBy a curious irony of fate it was from that very Auvergne that the\r\nlight broke which finally chased away the Wernerian darkness, and it\r\nwas by two of Werner's most distinguished disciples that the reaction\r\nwas begun.\r\n\r\nDaubuisson, a favourite pupil of the Freiberg professor, had written\r\nand published at Paris in 1803 a volume on the Basalts of Saxony,\r\nconceived in the true Wernerian spirit, and treating these rocks, as he\r\nhad been taught to regard then, as chemical precipitates from a former\r\nuniversal ocean. In the following year the young and accomplished\r\nFrenchman went to Auvergne and the Vivarais that he might see with\r\nhis own eyes the alleged proofs of the volcanic origin of basalt.\r\nGreatly no doubt to his own surprise, he found these proofs to be\r\nirrefragable. With praiseworthy frankness he lost no time in publicly\r\nannouncing his recantation of the Wernerian doctrine on the subject,\r\nand ever afterwards he did good service in making the cause of truth\r\nand progress prevail.\r\n\r\nStill more sensational was the conversion of a yet more illustrious\r\nprophet of the Freiberg school--the great Leopold von Buch. He too had\r\nbeen educated in the strictest Wernerian faith. But eventually, after\r\na journey to Italy, he made his way to Auvergne in 1802, and there, in\r\npresence of the astonishing volcanic records of that region, the scales\r\nseem to have fallen from his eyes also. With evident reluctance he\r\nbegan to doubt his master's teaching in regard to basalt and volcanoes.\r\nHe went into raptures over the clear presentation of volcanic phenomena\r\nto be found in Central France, traced each detail among the puys, as\r\nin the examination of a series of vast models, and remarked that while\r\nwe may infer what takes place at Vesuvius, we can actually see what\r\nhas transpired at the Puy de Pariou. With the enthusiasm of a convert\r\nhe rushed into the discussion of the phenomena, but somehow omitted to\r\nmake any mention of Desmarest, who had taught the truth so many years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the example of such men as Daubuisson and Von Buch, the\r\nWernerian disciples gradually slackened in zeal for their master's\r\ntenets. They clung to their errors longer perhaps in Scotland than\r\nanywhere else out of Germany--a singular paradox only explicable by\r\nanother personal influence. Jameson, trained at Freiberg, carried\r\nthence to the University of Edinburgh the most implicit acceptance of\r\nthe tenets of the Saxon school, and continued to maintain the aqueous\r\norigin of basalt for many years after the notion had been abandoned by\r\nsome of his most distinguished contemporaries. But the error, though it\r\ndied hard, was confessed at last even by Jameson.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of this protracted and animated controversy the study\r\nof former volcanic action resumed its place among the accepted subjects\r\nof geological research. From the peculiarly favourable structure\r\nof the country, Britain has been enabled to make many important\r\ncontributions to the investigation of the subject. De la Beche,\r\nMurchison and Sedgwick led the way in recognizing, even among the most\r\nancient stratified formations of England and Wales, the records of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanoes and of their subterranean intrusions. Scrope\r\nthrew himself with ardour into the study of the volcanoes of Italy\r\nand of Central France. Maclaren made known the structure of some of\r\nthe volcanic groups of the lowlands of Scotland. Ramsay, Selwyn, and\r\nJukes, following these pioneers, were the first to map out a Palæozoic\r\nvolcanic region in ample detail. Sorby, applying to the study of\r\nrocks the method of microscopic examination by thin slices, devised\r\nby William Nicol of Edinburgh for the study of fossil plants, opened\r\nup a new and vast field in the domain of observational geology, and\r\nfurnished the geologist with a key to solve many of the problems of\r\nvolcanism. Thus, alike from the stratigraphical and petrographical\r\nsides, the igneous rocks of this country have received constantly\r\nincreasing attention.\r\n\r\nThe present work is intended to offer a summary of what has now been\r\nascertained regarding the former volcanoes of the British Isles. The\r\nsubject has occupied much of my time and thought all through life.\r\nBorn among the crags that mark the sites of some of these volcanoes,\r\nI was led in my boyhood to interest myself in their structure and\r\nhistory. The fascination which they then exercised has lasted till now,\r\nimpelling me to make myself acquainted with the volcanic records all\r\nover our islands, and to travel into the volcanic regions of Europe and\r\nWestern America for the purpose of gaining clearer conceptions of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time during a period of almost forty years I have\r\ncommunicated chiefly to the Geological Society of London and the\r\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh the results of my researches. As materials\r\naccumulated, the desire arose to combine them into a general narrative\r\nof the whole progress of volcanic action from the remotest geological\r\nperiods down to the time when the latest eruptions ceased. An\r\nopportunity of partially putting this design into execution occurred\r\nwhen, as President of the Geological Society, the duty devolved upon\r\nme of giving the Annual Addresses in 1891 and 1892. Within the limits\r\npermissible to such essays, it was not possible to present more than\r\na full summary of the subject. Since that time I have continued my\r\nresearches in the field, especially among the Tertiary volcanic areas,\r\nand have now expanded the two Addresses by the incorporation of a large\r\namount of new matter and of portions of my published papers.\r\n\r\nIn the onward march of science a book which is abreast of our knowledge\r\nto-day begins to be left behind to-morrow. Nevertheless it may serve\r\na useful purpose if it does no more than make a definite presentation\r\nof the condition of that knowledge at a particular time. Such a\r\nstatement becomes a kind of landmark by which subsequent progress may\r\nbe measured. It may also be of service in indicating the gaps that have\r\nto be filled up, and the fields where fresh research may most hopefully\r\nbe undertaken.\r\n\r\nI have to thank the Councils of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and\r\nthe Geological Society for their permission to use a number of the\r\nillustrations which have accompanied my papers published in their\r\n_Transactions_ and _Journal_. To Colonel Evans and Miss Thom of Canna\r\nI am indebted for the photographs which they have kindly taken for me.\r\nTo those of my colleagues in the Geological Survey who have furnished\r\nme with information my best thanks are due. Their contributions are\r\nacknowledged where they have been made use of in the text.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of these volumes are chiefly from my own note-books\r\nand sketch-books.

Whatever in outer nature stimulated\r\nor repressed courage, inventiveness, endurance, whatever tended to\r\nharden or to weaken the bodily faculties, whatever appealed to the\r\nimagination or excited the fancy, became a powerful factor in human\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThus, in the dawn of civilization, the frequent recurrence of\r\nearthquakes and volcanic eruptions throughout the basin of the\r\nMediterranean could not but have a marked effect on the peoples that\r\ndwelt by the borders of that sea. While every part of the region was\r\nfrom time to time shaken by underground commotion, there were certain\r\nplaces that became specially noteworthy for the wonder and terror of\r\ntheir catastrophes. When, after successive convulsions, vast clouds\r\nof black smoke rose from a mountain and overspread the sky, when the\r\nbrightness of noon was rapidly replaced by the darkness of midnight,\r\nwhen the air grew thick with stifling dust and a rain of stones and\r\nashes fell from it on all the surrounding country, when streams of what\r\nlooked like liquid fire poured forth and desolated gardens, vineyards,\r\nfields and villages--then did men feel sure that the gods were angry.\r\nThe contrast between the peacefulness and beauty of the ordinary\r\nlandscape and the hideous warfare of the elements at these times of\r\nvolcanic fury could not but powerfully impress the imagination and give\r\na colour to early human conceptions of nature and religion.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in one limited district that these manifestations of\r\nunderground convulsion showed themselves. The islands of the Ægean\r\nhad their volcanoes, and the Greeks who dwelt among them watched\r\ntheir glowing fires by night and their clouds of steam by day,\r\nculminating now and then in a stupendous explosion, like that which, in\r\nprehistoric time, destroyed the island of Santorin. As the islanders\r\nvoyaged eastward they would see, on the coast of Asia Minor, the black\r\nbristling lavas of the \"Burnt Country,\" perhaps even then flowing from\r\ntheir rugged heaps of cinders. Or when, more adventurously still, they\r\nsailed westward into the Tyrrhenian waters, they beheld the snowy cone\r\nof Etna, with its dark canopy of smoke and the lurid nocturnal gleam of\r\nits fires; while from time to time they witnessed there on a still more\r\nstupendous scale the horrors of a great volcanic eruption.\r\n\r\nFrom all sides, therefore, the early Greek voyagers would carry back to\r\nthe mother-country marvellous tales of convulsion and disaster. They\r\nwould tell how the sky rapidly darkened even in the blaze of mid-day,\r\nhow the land was smothered with dust and stones, how over the sea there\r\nspread such a covering of ashes that the oarsmen could hardly drive\r\ntheir vessels onward, how red-hot stones, whirling high overhead,\r\nrained down on sails and deck, and crushed or burnt whatever they fell\r\nupon, and how, as the earth shook and the sea rose in sudden waves and\r\nthe mountain gave forth an appalling din of constant explosion, it\r\nverily seemed that the end of the world had come.\r\n\r\nTo the actual horrors of such scenes there could hardly fail to be\r\nadded the usual embellishments of travellers' tales. Thus, in the end,\r\nthe volcanoes of the Mediterranean basin came to play a not unimportant\r\npart in Hellenic mythology. They seemed to stand up as everlasting\r\nmemorials of the victory of Zeus over the giants and monsters of an\r\nearlier time. And as the lively Greek beheld Mount Etna in eruption,\r\nhis imagination readily pictured the imprisoned Titan buried under the\r\nburning roots of the mountain, breathing forth fire and smoke, and\r\nconvulsing the country far and near, as he turned himself on his uneasy\r\npallet.\r\n\r\nWhen in later centuries the scientific spirit began to displace the\r\npopular and mythological interpretation of natural phenomena, the\r\nexistence of volcanoes and their extraordinary phenomena offered\r\na fruitful field for speculation and conjecture. As men journeyed\r\noutward from the Mediterranean cradle of civilization, they met with\r\nvolcanic manifestations in many other parts of the world. When they\r\neventually penetrated into the Far East, they encountered volcanoes on\r\na colossal scale and in astonishing abundance. When they had discovered\r\nthe New World they learnt that, in that hemisphere also, \"burning\r\nmountains\" were numerous and of gigantic dimensions. Gradually it was\r\nascertained that vast lines of volcanic activity encircle the globe.\r\nBy slow degrees the volcano was recognized to be as normal a part of\r\nthe mechanism of our planet as the rivers that flow on the terrestrial\r\nsurface. And now at last men devote themselves to the task of\r\ncritically watching the operations of volcanoes with as much enthusiasm\r\nas they display in the investigation of any other department of nature.\r\nThey feel that their knowledge of the earth extends to little beyond\r\nits mere outer skin, and that the mystery which still hangs over the\r\nvast interior of the planet can only, if ever, be dispelled by the\r\npatient study of these vents of communication between the interior and\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we desire to form some adequate idea of the part which\r\nvolcanic action has played in the past history of the earth, we should\r\nbe misled were we to confine our attention to the phenomena of the\r\neruptions of the present day. An attentive examination of any modern\r\nvolcano will convince us that of some of the most startling features of\r\nan eruption no enduring memorial remains. The convulsive earthquakes\r\nthat accompany a great volcanic paroxysm, unless where they actually\r\nfissure the ground, leave little or no trace behind them. Lamentably\r\ndestructive as they are to human life and property, the havoc which\r\nthey work is mostly superficial. In a year or two the ruins have been\r\ncleared away, the earth-falls have been healed over, the prostrated\r\ntrees have been removed, and, save in the memories and chronicles of\r\nthe inhabitants, no record of the catastrophe may survive. The clouds\r\nof dust and showers of ashes which destroyed the crops and crushed\r\nin the roofs of houses soon disappear from the air, and the covering\r\nwhich they leave over the surface of a district gradually mingles with\r\nthe soil. Vegetation eventually regains its place, and the landscape\r\nbecomes again as smiling as before.\r\n\r\nEven where the materials thrown out from the crater accumulate in much\r\ngreater mass, where thick deposits of ashes or solid sheets of lava\r\nbury the old land-surface, the look of barren desolation, though in\r\nsome cases it may endure for long centuries, may in others vanish in\r\na few years. The surface-features of the district are altered indeed,\r\nbut the new topography soon ceases to look new. Another generation of\r\ninhabitants loses recollection of the old landmarks, and can hardly\r\nrealize that what has become so familiar to itself differs so much from\r\nwhat was familiar to its fathers.\r\n\r\nBut even when the volcanic covering, thus thrown athwart a wide\r\ntract of country, has been concealed under a new growth of soil and\r\nvegetation, it still remains a prey to the ceaseless processes of\r\ndecay and degradation which everywhere affect the surface of the land.\r\nNo feature of a modern volcano is more impressive than the lesson\r\nwhich it conveys of the reality and potency of this continual waste.\r\nThe northern slopes of Vesuvius, for example, are trenched with deep\r\nravines, which in the course of centuries have been dug out of the\r\nlavas and tuffs of Monte Somma by rain and melted snow. Year by year\r\nthese chasms are growing deeper and wider, while the ridges between\r\nthem are becoming narrower. In some cases, indeed, the intervening\r\nridges have been reduced to sharp crests which are split up and\r\nlowered by the unceasing influence of the weather. The slopes of such\r\na volcanic cone have been aptly compared to a half-opened umbrella. It\r\nrequires little effort of imagination to picture a time, by no means\r\nremote in a geological sense, when, unless renovated by the effects\r\nof fresh eruptions, the cone will have been so levelled with the\r\nsurrounding country that the peasants of the future will trail their\r\nvines and build their cots over the site of the old volcano, in happy\r\nignorance of what has been the history of the ground beneath their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhat is here predicted as probable or certain in the future has\r\nundoubtedly happened again and again in the past. Over many districts\r\nof Europe and Western America extinct volcanoes may be seen in every\r\nstage of decay. The youngest may still show, perfect and bare of\r\nvegetation, their cones and their craters, with the streams of lava\r\nthat escaped from them. Those of older date have been worn down into\r\nmere low rounded hills, or the whole cone has been cleared away, and\r\nthere is only left the hard core of material that solidified in the\r\nfunnel below the surface. The lava-sheets have been cut through by\r\nstreams, and now remain in mere scattered patches capping detached\r\nhills, which only a trained eye can recognize as relics of a once\r\ncontinuous level sheet of solid rock.\r\n\r\nBy this resistless degradation, a volcanic district is step by step\r\nstripped of every trace of its original surface. All that the eruptions\r\ndid to change the face of the landscape may be entirely obliterated.\r\nCones and craters, ashes and lavas, may be gradually effaced. And yet\r\nenough may be left to enable a geologist to make sure that volcanic\r\naction was once rife there. As the volcano marks a channel of direct\r\ncommunication between the interior of the earth and the atmosphere\r\noutside, there are subterranean as well as superficial manifestations\r\nof its activity, and while the latter are removed by denudation, the\r\nformer are one by one brought into light. The progress of denudation\r\nis a process of dissection, whereby every detail in the structure of a\r\nvolcano is successively cut down and laid bare. But for this process,\r\nour knowledge of the mechanism and history of volcanic action would be\r\nmuch less full and definite than happily it is. In active volcanoes\r\nthe internal and subterranean structure can only be conjectured; in\r\nthose of ancient date, which have been deeply eroded, this underground\r\nstructure is open to the closest examination.\r\n\r\nBy gathering together evidence of this nature over the surface of\r\nthe globe, we learn that abundantly as still active volcanoes are\r\ndistributed on that surface, they form but a small fraction of the\r\ntotal number of vents which have at various times been in eruption. In\r\nItaly, for example, while Vesuvius is active on the mainland, and Etna,\r\nStromboli and Volcano display their vigour among the islands, there are\r\nscores of old volcanoes that have been silent and cold ever since the\r\nbeginning of history, yet show by their cones of cinders and streams of\r\nbristling lava that they were energetic enough in their day. But the\r\nItalian volcanic region is only one of many to be found on the European\r\nContinent. If we travel eastward into Hungary, or northward into the\r\nEifel, or into the heart of France, we encounter abundant cones and\r\ncraters, many of them so fresh that, though there is no historical\r\nrecord of their activity, they look as if they had been in eruption\r\nonly a few generations ago.\r\n\r\nBut when the geologist begins to search among rocks of still older\r\ndate than these comparatively recent volcanic memorials, he meets\r\nwith abundant relics of far earlier eruptions. And as he arranges the\r\nchronicles of the earth's history, he discovers that each section of\r\nthe long cycle of geological ages has preserved its records of former\r\nvolcanoes. In a research of this kind he can best realize how much\r\nhe owes to the process of denudation. The volcanic remains of former\r\ngeological periods have in most cases been buried under younger\r\ndeposits, and have sunk sometimes thousands of feet below the level of\r\nthe sea. They have been dislocated and upheaved again during successive\r\ncommotions of the terrestrial crust, and have at last been revealed by\r\nthe gradual removal of the pile of material under which they had lain.\r\n\r\nHence we learn that the active volcanoes of the present time, which\r\nreally embrace but a small part of the volcanic history of our planet,\r\nare the descendants of a long line of ancestors. Their distribution\r\nand activity should be considered not merely from the evidence they\r\nthemselves supply, but in the light derived from a study of that\r\nancestry. It is only when we take this broad view of the subject that\r\nwe can be in a position to form some adequate conception of the nature\r\nand history of volcanoes in the geological evolution of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn this research it is obvious that the presently active volcano\r\nmust be the basis and starting-point of inquiry. At that channel of\r\ncommunication between the unknown inside and the familiar outside of\r\nour globe, we can watch what takes place in times of quiescence or of\r\nactivity. We can there study each successive phase of an eruption,\r\nmeasure temperatures, photograph passing phenomena, collect gases and\r\nvapours, register the fall of ashes or the flow of lavas, and gather a\r\nvast body of facts regarding the materials that are ejected from the\r\ninterior, and the manner of their emission.\r\n\r\nIndispensable as this information is for the comprehension of volcanic\r\naction, it obviously affords after all but a superficial glimpse of\r\nthat action. We cannot see beyond the bottom of the crater. We cannot\r\ntell anything about the subterranean ducts, or how the molten and\r\nfragmental materials behave in them. All the underground mechanism\r\nof volcanoes is necessarily hidden from our eyes. But much of this\r\nconcealed structure has been revealed in the case of ancient volcanic\r\nmasses, which have been buried and afterwards upraised and laid bare by\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\nIn yet another important aspect modern volcanoes do not permit us to\r\nobtain full knowledge of the subject. The terrestrial vents, from which\r\nwe derive our information, by no means represent all the existing\r\npoints of direct connection between the interior and the exterior of\r\nthe planet. We know that some volcanic eruptions occur under the sea,\r\nand doubtless vast numbers more take place there of which we know\r\nnothing. But the conditions under which these submarine discharges\r\nare effected, the behaviour of the outflowing lava under a body of\r\noceanic water, and the part played by fragmentary materials in the\r\nexplosions, can only be surmised. Now and then a submarine volcano\r\npushes its summit above the sea-level, and allows its operations to be\r\nseen, but in so doing it becomes practically a terrestrial volcano, and\r\nthe peculiar submarine phenomena are still effectually concealed from\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic records of former geological periods, however, are in\r\nlarge measure those of eruptions under the sea. In studying them we\r\nare permitted, as it were, to explore the sea-bottom. We can trace\r\nhow sheets of coral and groves of crinoids were buried under showers\r\nof ashes and stones, and how the ooze and silt of the sea-floor were\r\noverspread with streams of lava. We are thus, in some degree, enabled\r\nto realize what must now happen over many parts of the bed of the\r\nexisting ocean.\r\n\r\nThe geologist who undertakes an investigation into the history of\r\nvolcanic action within the area of the British Isles during past\r\ntime, with a view to the better comprehension of this department\r\nof terrestrial physics, finds himself in a situation of peculiar\r\nadvantage. Probably no region on the face of the globe is better fitted\r\nthan these islands to furnish a large and varied body of evidence\r\nregarding the progress of volcanic energy in former ages. This special\r\nfitness may be traced to four causes--1st, The remarkable completeness\r\nof the geological record in Britain; 2nd, The geographical position of\r\nthe region on the oceanic border of a continent; 3rd, The singularly\r\nample development to be found there of volcanic rocks belonging to a\r\nlong succession of geological ages; and 4th, The extent to which this\r\nfull chronicle of volcanic activity has been laid bare by denudation.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, the geological record of Britain is singularly\r\ncomplete. It has often been remarked how largely all the great periods\r\nof geological time are represented within the narrow confines of these\r\nislands. The gaps in the chronicle are comparatively few, and for the\r\nmost part are not of great moment.\r\n\r\nThanks to the restricted area of the country and to the large number\r\nof observers, this remarkably full record of geological history has\r\nbeen studied with a minute care which has hardly been equalled in any\r\nother country. The detailed succession of all the formations has been\r\nso fully determined in Britain that the very names first applied here\r\nto them and to their subdivisions have in large measure passed into\r\nthe familiar language of geology all over the globe. Every definite\r\nplatform in the stratigraphical series has been more or less fully\r\nworked out. A basis has thus been laid for referring each incident in\r\nthe geological history of the region to its proper relative date.\r\n\r\n2. In the second place, the geographical position of Britain gives\r\nit a notable advantage in regard to the manifestations of volcanic\r\nenergy. Rising from the margin of a great ocean-basin and extending\r\nalong the edge of a continent, these islands have lain on that critical\r\nborder-zone of the terrestrial surface, where volcanic action is apt\r\nto be most vigorous and continuous. It has long been remarked that\r\nvolcanoes are generally placed not far from the sea. From the earliest\r\ngeological periods the site of Britain, even when submerged below\r\nthe sea, has never lain far from the land which supplied the vast\r\naccumulations of sediment that went to form the Palæozoic and later\r\nformations, while, on the other hand, it frequently formed part of the\r\nland of former geological periods. It was thus most favourably situated\r\nas a theatre for both terrestrial and submarine volcanic activity.\r\n\r\n3. In the third place, this advantageous geographical position is\r\nfound to have been attended with an altogether remarkable abundance\r\nand persistence of volcanic eruptions. No tract of equal size yet\r\nknown on the face of the globe furnishes so ample a record of volcanic\r\nactivity from the earliest geological periods down into Tertiary\r\ntime. Every degree of energy may be signalized in that record, from\r\ncolossal eruptions which piled up thousands of feet of rock down to\r\nthe feeblest discharge of dust and stones. Every known type of volcano\r\nis represented--great central cones like Etna or Vesuvius, scattered\r\ngroups of small cones like the _puys_ of France, and fissure- or\r\ndyke-eruptions like those of recent times in Iceland.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the accurate manner in which the stratigraphy of the country\r\nhas been established permits each successive era in the long volcanic\r\nhistory to be precisely determined, and allows us to follow the whole\r\nprogress of that history stage by stage, from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics may be instructively represented on a map, such\r\nas that which accompanies the present volume (Map I.). The reader will\r\nthere observe how repeatedly volcanic eruptions have taken place, not\r\nmerely within the general area of the British Isles, but even within\r\nthe same limited region of that area. The broad midland valley of\r\nScotland has been especially the theatre for their display. From the\r\nearly part of the Lower Silurian period, through the ages of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, Carboniferous and Permian systems, hundreds of volcanic\r\nvents were active in that region, while in long subsequent time there\r\ncame the fissure-eruptions of the Tertiary series.\r\n\r\n4. In the fourth place, the geological revolutions of successive ages\r\nhave made this long volcanic chronicle fully accessible to observation.\r\nHad the lavas and ashes of one period remained buried under the\r\nsedimentary accumulations of the next, their story would have been lost\r\nto us. We should only have been able to decipher the latest records\r\nwhich might happen to lie on the surface. Fortunately for the progress\r\nof geology, the endless vicissitudes of a continental border have\r\nbrought up the very oldest rocks once more to the surface. All the\r\nlater formations of the earth's crust have likewise been upraised and\r\nexposed to denudation during long cycles of time. In this manner, the\r\nrocky framework of the country has been laid bare, and each successive\r\nchapter of its geological history may be satisfactorily deciphered.\r\nThe singularly complete volcanic chronicle, after being entombed under\r\nyounger deposits, has been broken up and raised once more into view.\r\nThe active vents of former periods have been dissected, submarine\r\nstreams of lava have been uncovered, sheets of ashes that fell over the\r\nsea-bottom have been laid bare. The progress of denudation is specially\r\nfavoured in such a variable and moist climate as that of Britain,\r\nand thus by the co-operation of underground and meteoric causes the\r\nmarvellous volcanic records of this country have been laid open in\r\nminutest detail.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another respect in which the volcanic geology of Britain\r\npossesses a special value. Popular imagination has long been prone to\r\nsee signs of volcanic action in the more prominent rocky features\r\nof landscape. A bold crag, a deep and precipitous ravine, a chasm in\r\nthe side of a mountain, have been unhesitatingly set down as proof of\r\nvolcanic disturbance. Many a cauldron-shaped recess, like the corries\r\nof Scotland or the cwms of Wales, has been cited as an actual crater,\r\nwith its encircling walls still standing almost complete.\r\n\r\nThe relics of former volcanoes in this country furnish ample proofs\r\nto dispel these common misconceptions. They show that not a single\r\ncrater anywhere remains, save where it has been buried under lava;\r\nthat no trace of the original cones has survived, except in a few\r\ndoubtful cases where they may have been preserved under subsequent\r\naccumulations of material; that in the rugged tracts, where volcanic\r\naction has been thought to have been most rife, there may be not a\r\nvestige of it, while, on the other hand, where the uneducated eye would\r\nnever suspect the presence of any remnant of volcanic energy, lavas\r\nand ashes may abound. We are thus presented with some of the most\r\nimpressive contrasts in geological history, while, at the same time,\r\nthis momentous lesson is borne in upon the mind, that the existing\r\ninequalities in the configuration of a landscape are generally due\r\nfar less to the influence of subterranean force than to the action of\r\nthe superficial agents which are ceaselessly carving the face of the\r\nland. Those rocks which from their hardness or structure are best able\r\nto withstand that destruction rise into prominence, while the softer\r\nmaterial around them is worn away. Volcanic rocks are no exception to\r\nthis rule, as the geological structure of Britain amply proves.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, forming Book I. of this work, I propose to\r\nbegin by offering some general remarks regarding the nature and causes\r\nof volcanic action, so far as these are known to us. I shall then\r\nproceed to consider the character of the evidence that may be expected\r\nto be met with respecting the former prevalence of that action at any\r\nparticular locality where volcanic disturbances have long since ceased.\r\nThe most telling evidence of old volcanoes is naturally to be found\r\nin the materials which they have left behind them, and the reader's\r\nattention will be asked to the special characteristics of these\r\nmaterials, in so far as they give evidence of former volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nAs has been already remarked, many of the most prominent phenomena of\r\na modern volcano are only of transient importance. The earthquakes and\r\ntremors, and the constant disengagement of steam and gases, that play\r\nso conspicuous a part in an eruption, may leave no sensible record\r\nbehind them. But even the cones of ashes and lava, which are piled up\r\ninto mountainous masses, have no true permanence: they are liable to\r\nceaseless erosion by the meteoric agencies of waste, and every stage in\r\ntheir degradation may be traced. In successive examples we can follow\r\nthem as they are cut down to the very core, until in the end they are\r\nentirely effaced.\r\n\r\nWe may well, therefore, ask at the outset by what more enduring\r\nrecords we may hope to detect the traces of former volcanic action.\r\nThe following introductory chapters will be devoted to an attempt to\r\nanswer this question. I shall try to show the nature and relative\r\nimportance of the records of ancient volcanoes; how these records,\r\ngenerally so fragmentary, may be pieced together so as to be made to\r\nfurnish the history which they contain; how their relative chronology\r\nmay be established; how their testimony may be supplemented in such\r\nwise that the position of long vanished seas, lands, rivers, and lakes\r\nmay be ascertained; and how, after ages of geological revolution,\r\nvolcanic rocks that have lain long buried under the surface now\r\ninfluence the scenery of the regions where they have once more been\r\nexposed to view.\r\n\r\nFrom this groundwork of ascertained fact and reasonable inference, we\r\nshall enter in Book II. upon the story of the old volcanoes of the\r\nBritish Isles. It is usual to treat geological history in chronological\r\norder, beginning with the earliest ages. And this method, as on the\r\nwhole the most convenient, will be adopted in the present work. At\r\nthe same time, the plan so persistently followed by Lyell, of working\r\nbackward from the present into the past, has some distinct advantages.\r\nThe volcanic records of the later ages are much simpler and clearer\r\nthan those of older times, and the student may, in some respects,\r\nprofitably study the history of the Tertiary eruptions before he\r\nproceeds to make himself acquainted with the scantier chronicles of the\r\neruptions of the Palæozoic periods. But as I wish to follow the gradual\r\nevolution of volcanic phenomena, and to show how volcanic energy has\r\nvaried, waxing and waning through successive vast intervals of time, I\r\nwill adhere to the chronological sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  The Nature and Causes of Volcanic Action--Modern Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA volcano is a conical or dome-shaped hill or mountain, consisting of\r\nmaterials which have been erupted from an orifice leading down from\r\nthe surface into the heated interior of the earth. Among modern and\r\nrecent volcanoes three types may be recognized. In the first and most\r\nfamiliar of these, the lavas and ashes ejected from the central vent\r\nhave gathered around it by successive eruptions, until they have built\r\nup a central cone like those of Etna and Vesuvius. As this cone grows\r\nin height and diameter, lateral or parasitic cones are formed on its\r\nflanks, and may become themselves the chief actively erupting vents.\r\nThis type of volcano, which has been so long well known from its\r\nMediterranean examples, was until recently believed by geologists to be\r\nthe normal, or indeed the only, phase of volcanic energy on the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nA modification of this type is to be found in a few regions where\r\nfragmentary discharges are small in amount and where the eruptions are\r\nalmost wholly confined to the emission of tolerably liquid lava. A vast\r\ndome with gently sloping declivities may in this way be formed, as in\r\nthe Sandwich Islands and in certain parts of Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe second type of volcano is at the present day extensively developed\r\nonly in Iceland, but in Tertiary time it appears to have had a wide\r\nrange over the globe, for stupendous memorials of it are preserved\r\nin North-Western Europe, in Western America, and in India. It is\r\ndistinguished by the formation of numerous parallel fissures from which\r\nthe lava gushes forth, either with or without the formation of small\r\ncinder-cones along the lines of the chasms.\r\n\r\nThe third type is distinguished by the formation of groups of\r\ncinder-cones or lava-domes, which from their admirable development\r\nin Central France have received the name of _Puys_. From these vents\r\nconsiderable streams of lava have sometimes been discharged.\r\n\r\nWithout entering here into a detailed inquiry regarding the nature and\r\ncauses of Volcanic Action, we may with advantage consider briefly the\r\ntwo main factors on which this action appears to depend.\r\n\r\n1. Much uncertainty still exists as to the condition and composition\r\nof the earth's interior. The wide distribution of volcanoes over the\r\nglobe, together with the general similarity of materials brought\r\nby them up to the surface, formerly led to the belief that our\r\nplanet consists of a central mass of molten rock enclosed within a\r\ncomparatively thin solid crust. Physical arguments, however, have\r\nsince demonstrated that the earth, with such a structure, would have\r\nundergone great tidal deformation, but that in actual fact it has a\r\ngreater rigidity than if it were made of solid glass or steel.\r\n\r\nFrom all the evidence obtainable it is certain that the temperature\r\nof the earth's interior must be high. The rate of increase of this\r\ntemperature downward from the surface differs from place to place; but\r\nan increase is always observed. At a depth of a few miles, every known\r\nsubstance must be much hotter than its melting point at the surface.\r\nBut at the great pressures within the earth, actual liquefaction is no\r\ndoubt prevented, and the nucleus remains solid, though at a temperature\r\nat which, but for the pressure, it would be like so much molten iron.\r\n\r\nAny cause which will diminish the pressure may allow the intensely hot\r\nmaterial within the globe to pass into the liquid state. There is one\r\nknown cause which will bring about this result. The downward increment\r\nof temperature proves that our planet is continually losing heat. As\r\nthe outer crust is comparatively cool, and does not become sensibly\r\nhotter by the uprise of heat from within, the hot nucleus must cool\r\nfaster than the crust is doing. Now cooling involves contraction. The\r\nhot interior is contracting faster than the cooler shell which encloses\r\nit, and that shell is thus forced to subside. In its descent it has to\r\nadjust itself to a constantly diminishing diameter. It can do so only\r\nby plication or by rupture.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrestrial crust, under the strain of contraction, is\r\ncompressed into folds, the relief thus obtained is not distributed\r\nuniformly over the whole surface of the planet. From an early\r\ngeological period it appears to have followed certain lines. How these\r\ncame to be at first determined we cannot tell. But it is certain\r\nthat they have served again and again, during successive periods of\r\nterrestrial readjustment. These lines of relief coincide, on the whole,\r\nwith the axes of our continents. The land-areas of the globe may be\r\nregarded as owing their existence above sea-level to this result of\r\nterrestrial contraction. The crust underneath them has been repeatedly\r\nwrinkled, fractured and thrust upward by the vast oceanic subsidence\r\naround them. The long mountain-chains are thus, so to speak, the crests\r\nof the waves into which the crust has from time to time been thrown.\r\n\r\nAgain, the great lines of fracture in the crust of the earth probably\r\nlie in large measure within the land-areas, or at least parallel with\r\ntheir axes and close to their borders. Where the disposition of the\r\nchief ruptures and of the predominant plications can be examined,\r\nthese leading structural features are found to be, on the whole,\r\ncoincident. In the British Islands, for instance, the prevalent trend\r\nof the axes of folding from early Palæozoic to Tertiary time has\r\nbeen from south-west to north-east. How profoundly this direction\r\nof earth-movement has affected the structure of the region is shown\r\nby any ordinary map, in the long hill-ranges of the land and in the\r\nlong inlets of the sea. A geological map makes the dependence of the\r\nscenery upon the building of the rocks still more striking. Not only\r\nhave these rocks been plicated into endless foldings, the axes of\r\nwhich traverse the British Islands with a north-easterly trend: they\r\nhave likewise been dislocated by many gigantic ruptures, which tend on\r\nthe whole to follow the same direction. The line of the Great Glen,\r\nthe southern front of the Highlands, and the northern boundary of the\r\nSouthern Uplands of Scotland, are conspicuous examples of the position\r\nand effect of some of the greater fractures in the structure of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe ridging up of any part of the terrestrial crust will afford\r\nsome relief from pressure to the parts of the interior immediately\r\nunderneath. If, as is probable, the material of the earth's interior is\r\nat the melting point proper for the pressure at each depth, then any\r\ndiminution of the pressure may allow the intensely heated substance to\r\npass into the liquid state. It would be along the lines of terrestrial\r\nuplift that this relief would be given. It is there that active\r\nvolcanoes are found. The molten material is forced upward under these\r\nupraised ridges by the subsidence of the surrounding regions. And where\r\nby rupture of the crust this material can make its way to the surface,\r\nwe may conceive that it will be ejected as lava or as stones and ashes.\r\n\r\nViewed in a broad way, such appears to be the mechanism involved in\r\nthe formation and distribution of volcanoes over the surface of the\r\nearth. But obviously this explanation only carries us so far in the\r\nelucidation of volcanic action. If the molten magma flowed out merely\r\nin virtue of the influence of terrestrial contraction, it might do so\r\nfor the most part tranquilly, though it would probably be affected\r\nby occasional sudden snaps, as the crust yielded to accumulations of\r\npressure. Human experience has no record of the actual elevation of a\r\nmountain-chain. We may believe that if such an event were to happen\r\nsuddenly or rapidly, it would be attended with gigantic catastrophes\r\nover the surface of the globe. We can hardly conceive what would\r\nbe the scale of a volcanic eruption attending upon so colossal a\r\ndisturbance of the terrestrial crust. But the eruptions which have\r\ntaken place within the memory of man have been the accompaniments\r\nof no such disturbance. Although they have been many in number and\r\nsometimes powerful in effect, they have seldom been attended with any\r\nmarked displacement of the surrounding parts of the terrestrial crust.\r\nContraction is, of course, continuously and regularly in progress, and\r\nwe may suppose that the consequent subsidence, though it results in\r\nintermittent wrinkling and uplifting of the terrestrial ridges, may\r\nalso be more or less persistent in the regions lying outside these\r\nridges. There will thus be a constant pressure of the molten magma\r\ninto the roots of volcanoes, and a persistent tendency for the magma\r\nto issue at the surface at every available rent or orifice. The energy\r\nand duration of outflow, if they depended wholly upon the effects of\r\ncontraction, would thus vary with the rate of subsidence of the sinking\r\nareas, probably assuming generally a feeble development, but sometimes\r\nbursting into fountains of molten rock hundreds of feet in height, like\r\nthose observed from time to time in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n2. The actual phenomena of volcanic eruptions, however, show that a\r\nsource of explosive energy is almost always associated with them, and\r\nthat while the transference of the subterranean molten magma towards\r\nthe volcanic vents may be referred to the results of terrestrial\r\ncontraction, the violent discharge of materials from those vents must\r\nbe assigned to some kind of energy stored up in the substance of the\r\nearth's interior.\r\n\r\nThe deep-seated magma from which lavas ascend contains various vapours\r\nand gases which, under the enormous pressure within and beneath the\r\nterrestrial crust, are absorbed or dissolved in it. So great is the\r\ntension of these gaseous constituents, that when from any cause the\r\npressure on the magma is suddenly relieved, they are liberated with\r\nexplosive violence.\r\n\r\nA volcanic paroxysm is thus immediately the effect of the rapid escape\r\nof these imprisoned gases and vapours. With such energy does the\r\nexplosion sometimes take place, that the ascending column of molten\r\nlava is blown into the finest impalpable dust, which may load the air\r\naround a volcano for many days before it falls to the ground, or may be\r\nborne in the upper regions of the atmosphere round the globe.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of dissolved gases varies in different lavas, while the\r\nlavas themselves differ in the degree of their liquidity. Some flow\r\nout tranquilly like molten iron, others issue in a pasty condition and\r\nrapidly congeal into scoriæ and clinkers. Thus within the magma itself\r\nthe amount of explosive energy is far from being always the same.\r\n\r\nIt is to the co-operation of these two causes--terrestrial contraction\r\nand its effects on the one hand, and the tension of absorbed gases and\r\nvapours the other--that the phenomena of volcanoes appear to be mainly\r\ndue. There is no reason to believe that modern volcanoes differ in any\r\nessential respect from those of past ages in the earth's history. It\r\nmight, indeed, have been anticipated that the general energy of the\r\nplanet would manifest itself in far more stupendous volcanic eruptions\r\nin early times than those of the modern period. But there is certainly\r\nno geological evidence in favour of such a difference. One of the\r\nobjects of the present work is to trace the continuity of volcanic\r\nphenomena back to the very earliest epochs, and to show that, so far as\r\nthe geological records go, the interior of the planet has reacted on\r\nits exterior in the same way and with the same results.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to inquire how far volcanoes leave behind them\r\nevidence of their existence. I shall devote the next two or three\r\nchapters to a consideration of the proofs of volcanic action furnished\r\nby the very nature of the materials brought up from the interior of\r\nthe earth, by the arrangement of these materials at the surface, by\r\nthe existence of the actual funnels or ducts from which they were\r\ndischarged above ground, and by the disposition of the masses of rock\r\nwhich, at various depths below the surface, have been injected into and\r\nhave solidified within the terrestrial crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  Ancient Volcanoes: Proofs of their existence derived from the\r\n     Nature of the Rocks erupted from the Earth's Interior. A.\r\n     Materials erupted at the Surface--Extrusive Series. i. Lavas,\r\n     their General Characters. Volcanic Cycles. ii. Volcanic\r\n     Agglomerates, Breccias and Tuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe materials brought by volcanic action from the earth's interior\r\nhave certain common characters which distinguish them from other\r\nconstituents of the terrestrial crust. Hence the occurrence of these\r\nmaterials on any part of the earth's surface affords convincing proofs\r\nof former volcanic eruptions, even where all outward trace of actual\r\nvolcanoes may have been effaced from the topographical features of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nVolcanic products may be classed in two divisions--1st, Those which\r\nhave been ejected at the surface of the earth, or the Extrusive series;\r\nand 2nd, Those which have been injected into the terrestrial crust at\r\na greater or less distance below the surface, and which are known as\r\nthe Intrusive series. Extrusive rocks may be further classified in two\r\ngreat groups--(i.) The Lavas, or those which have been poured out in a\r\nmolten condition at the surface; and (ii.) The Fragmental Materials,\r\nincluding all kinds of pyroclastic detritus discharged from volcanic\r\nvents.\r\n\r\nTaking first the Extrusive volcanic rocks, we may in the present\r\nchapter consider those characters in them which are of most practical\r\nvalue in the investigation of the volcanic phenomena of former\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. LAVAS\r\n\r\nThe term Lava is a convenient and comprehensive designation for all\r\nthose volcanic products which have flowed out in a molten condition.\r\nThey differ from each other in composition and structure, but their\r\nvariations are comprised within tolerably definite limits.\r\n\r\nAs regards their composition they are commonly classed in three\r\ndivisions--1st, The Acid lavas, in which the proportion of silicic acid\r\nranges from a little below 70 per cent upwards; 2nd, The Intermediate\r\nlavas, wherein the percentage of silica may vary from 55 to near 70;\r\nand 3rd, The Basic lavas, where the acid constituent ranges from 55 per\r\ncent downwards. Sometimes the most basic kinds are distinguished as a\r\nfourth group under the name of Ultrabasic, in which the percentage of\r\nsilica may fall below 40.\r\n\r\nThe structures of lavas, however, furnish their most easily appreciated\r\ncharacteristics. Four of these structures deserve more particular\r\nattention: 1st, Cellular, vesicular or pumiceous structure; 2nd, The\r\npresence of glass, or some result of the devitrification of an original\r\nglass; 3rd, Flow-structure; and 4th, The arrangement of the rocks in\r\nsheets or beds, with columnar and other structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Vesicular structure, Lava from Ascension\r\nIsland, slightly less than natural size.]\r\n\r\n1. The CELLULAR, VESICULAR, SCORIACEOUS or PUMICEOUS STRUCTURE of\r\nvolcanic rocks (Fig. 1) could only have arisen in molten masses from\r\nthe expansion of imprisoned vapours or gases, and is thus of crucial\r\nimportance in deciding the once liquid condition of the rocks which\r\ndisplay it. The vesicles may be of microscopic minuteness, but are\r\ngenerally quite visible to the naked eye, and are often large and\r\nconspicuous. Sometimes these cavities have been subsequently filled up\r\nwith calcite, quartz, agate, zeolites or other mineral deposition. As\r\nthe kernels thus produced are frequently flattened or almond-shaped\r\n(_amygdales_), owing to elongation of the steam-holes by movement of\r\nthe lava before its consolidation, the rocks containing them are said\r\nto be _amygdaloidal_.\r\n\r\nThis structure, though eminently characteristic of superficial lavas,\r\nis not always by itself sufficient to distinguish them from the\r\nintrusive rocks. Examples will be given in later chapters where dykes,\r\nsills and other masses of injected igneous material are conspicuously\r\ncellular in some parts. But, in such cases, the cavities are generally\r\ncomparatively small, usually spherical or approximately so, tolerably\r\nuniform in size and distribution, and, especially when they occur in\r\ndykes, distributed more particularly along certain lines or bands,\r\nsometimes with considerable regularity (see Figs. 90, 91, and 236).\r\n\r\nAmong the superficial lavas, however, such regularity is rarely to be\r\nseen. Now and then, indeed, a lava, which is not on the whole cellular,\r\nmay be found to have rows of vesicles arranged parallel to its under\r\nor upper surface, or it may have acquired a peculiar banded structure\r\nfrom the arrangement of its vesicles in parallel layers along the\r\ndirection of flow. The last-named peculiarity is widely distributed\r\namong the Tertiary lavas of North-Western Europe, and gives to their\r\nweathered surfaces a deceptive resemblance to tuffs or other stratified\r\nrocks (see Figs. 260, 310 and 311). It will be more particularly\r\nreferred to a few pages further on. In general, however, we may say\r\nthat the steam-cavities of lavas are quite irregular in size, shape\r\nand distribution, sometimes increasing to such relative proportions\r\nas to occupy most of the bulk of the rock, and in other places\r\ndisappearing, so as to leave the lava tolerably compact. When a lava\r\npresents an irregularly vesicular character, like that of the slags of\r\nan iron-furnace, it is said to be _slaggy_. When its upper surface is\r\nrugged and full of steam-vesicles of all sizes up to large cavernous\r\nspaces, it is said to be _scoriaceous_, and fragments of such a rock\r\nejected from a volcanic vent are spoken of as _scoriæ_.\r\n\r\nAttention to the flattening of the steam-vesicles in cellular lavas,\r\nwhich has just been alluded to as the result of the onward movement\r\nof the still molten mass, may show, by the trend and grouping of\r\nthese elongated cavities, the probable direction of the flow of the\r\nlava before it came to rest. Sometimes the vesicles have been drawn\r\nout and flattened to such a degree that the rock has acquired in\r\nconsequence a fissile structure. In other instances, the vesicles have\r\nbeen originally formed as long parallel and even branching tubes, like\r\nthe burrows of Annelids or the borings of _Teredo_. Some remarkable\r\nexamples of this exceptional structure have been obtained from the\r\nTertiary plateau-basalts of the Western Isles, of which an example is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the vesicles extend through the whole thickness of a\r\nlava. Frequently they may be found most developed towards the top and\r\nbottom; the central portion of the sheet being compact, while the top\r\nand bottom are rugged, cavernous or scoriaceous.\r\n\r\nThough originally the vesicles and cavernous spaces, blown open by the\r\nexpansion of the vapours dissolved in molten lava, remained empty on\r\nthe consolidation of the rock, they have generally been subsequently\r\nfilled up by the deposit within them of mineral substances carried in\r\naqueous solution. The minerals thus introduced are such as might have\r\nbeen derived from the removal of their constituent ingredients by the\r\nsolvent action of water on the surrounding rock. And as amygdaloids\r\nare generally more decayed than the non-vesicular lavas, it has been\r\ngenerally believed that the abstraction of mineral material and its\r\nre-deposit within the steam-vesicles have been due to the influence of\r\nmeteoric water, which at atmospheric temperatures and pressures has\r\nslowly percolated from the surface through the cellular lava, long\r\nafter the latter had consolidated and cooled, and even after volcanic\r\nenergy at the locality had entirely ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Elongation and branching of steam-vesicles in a\r\nlava, Kilninian, Isle of Mull, a little less than natural size.]\r\n\r\nExamples, however, are now accumulating which certainly prove that, in\r\nsome cases, the vesicles were filled up during the volcanic period.\r\nAmong the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of the Inner Hebrides, for instance,\r\nit can be shown that the lavas were already amygdaloidal before the\r\nprotrusion of the gabbros and granophyres which mark later stages of\r\nthe same continuous volcanic history, and even before the outpouring\r\nof much of the basalt of these plateaux. Not improbably the mineral\r\nsecretions were largely due to the influence of hot volcanic vapours\r\nduring the eruption of the basalts. This subject will be again referred\r\nto in the description of the Tertiary volcanic series.\r\n\r\nVesicular structure is more commonly and perfectly developed among the\r\nlavas which are basic and intermediate in composition than among those\r\nwhich are acid.\r\n\r\nWhile the existence of a highly vesicular or scoriaceous structure may\r\ngenerally be taken as proof that the rock displaying it flowed out at\r\nthe surface as a lava, other evidence pointing to the same conclusion\r\nmay often be gathered from the rocks with which the supposed lava is\r\nassociated. Where, for example, a scoriaceous lava is covered with\r\nstratified deposits which contain pieces of that lava, we may be\r\nconfident that the rock is an interstratified or contemporaneous sheet.\r\nIt has been erupted after the deposition of the strata on which it\r\nrests, and before that of the strata which cover it and contain pieces\r\nof it. In such a case, the geological date of the eruption could be\r\nprecisely defined. Illustrations of this reasoning will be given in\r\nChapter iv., and in the account of the volcanic series of Carboniferous\r\nage in Central Scotland, where a basic lava can sometimes be proved to\r\nbe a true flow and not an intrusive sill by the fact that portions of\r\nits upper slaggy surface are enclosed in overlying sandstone, shale or\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n2. The presence of GLASS, or of some result of the devitrification of\r\nan original glass, is an indication that the rock which exhibits it has\r\nonce been in a state of fusion. Even where no trace of the original\r\nvitreous condition may remain, stages in its devitrification, that is,\r\nin its conversion into a stony or lithoid condition, may be traceable.\r\nThus what are called spherulitic and perlitic structures (which will\r\nbe immediately described), either visible to the naked eye or only\r\nobservable with the aid of the microscope, afford evidence of the\r\nconsolidation and conversion of a glassy into a lithoid substance.\r\n\r\nStriking evidence of the former glassy, and therefore molten, condition\r\nof many rocks now lithoid is to be gained by the examination of thin\r\nslices of them under the microscope. Not only are vestiges of the\r\noriginal glass recognizable, but the whole progress of devitrification\r\nmay be followed into a crystalline structure. The primitive\r\ncrystallites or microlites of different minerals may be seen to have\r\ngrouped themselves together into more or less perfect crystals, while\r\nscattered crystals of earlier consolidation have been partially\r\ndissolved in and corroded by the molten glass. These and other\r\ncharacteristics of once fused rocks have to a considerable extent been\r\nimitated artificially by MM. Fouqué and Michel Lévy, who have fused the\r\nconstituent minerals in the proper proportions.\r\n\r\nSince traces of glass or of its representative devitrified structures\r\nare so abundantly discoverable in lavas, we may infer the original\r\ncondition of most lavas to have been vitreous. Where, for instance, the\r\nouter selvages of a basic dyke or sill are coated with a layer of black\r\nglass which rapidly passes into a fine-grained crystalline basalt, and\r\nthen again into a more largely crystalline or doleritic texture in the\r\ncentre, there can be no hesitation in believing that glassy coating to\r\nbe due to the sudden chilling and consolidation of the lava injected\r\nbetween the cool rocks that enclose it. The part that solidified first\r\nmay be regarded as probably representing the condition of the whole\r\nbody of lava at the time of intrusion. The lithoid or crystalline\r\nportion between the two vitreous outer layers shows the condition which\r\nthe molten rock finally assumed as it cooled more slowly.\r\n\r\nSome lavas, such as obsidians and pitchstones, have consolidated\r\nin the glassy form. More usually, however, a lithoid structure\r\nhas been developed, the original glass being only discoverable by\r\nthe microscope, and often not even by its aid. Two varieties of\r\ndevitrification may be observed among lavas, which, though not marked\r\noff from each other by any sharp lines, are on the whole distinctive of\r\nthe two great groups of acid and basic rocks.\r\n\r\n(1) Among the acid rocks, what is called the Felsitic type of\r\ndevitrification is characteristic. Thus, obsidians pass by intermediate\r\nstages from a clear transparent or translucent glass into a dull\r\nflinty or horny mass. When thin slices of these transitional forms are\r\nexamined under the microscope, minute hairs and fibres or trichites,\r\nwhich may be observed even in the most perfectly glassy rocks, are seen\r\nto increase in number until they entirely take the place of the glass.\r\nMicrolites of definite minerals may likewise be observed, together with\r\nindefinite granules, and the rock finally becomes a rhyolite, felsite\r\nor allied variety (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Microlites of the Pitchstone of Arran\r\n(magnified 70 diameters).]\r\n\r\nAt the same time it should be observed that, even in the vitreous\r\ncondition of a lava, definite crystals of an early consolidation were\r\ngenerally already present. Felspars and quartz, usually in large\r\nporphyritic forms, may be seen in the glass, often so corroded as to\r\nindicate that they were in course of being dissolved in the magma at\r\nthe time of the cooling and solidification of the mass. In obsidians\r\nand pitchstones such relics of an earlier or derived series of\r\ncrystallized minerals may often be recognized, while in felsites and\r\nquartz-porphyries they are equally prominent. Where large dispersed\r\ncrystals form a prominent characteristic in a rock they give rise to\r\nwhat is termed the _Porphyritic_ structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Perlitic structure in Felsitic Glass, Isle of\r\nMull (magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Spherulitic structure (magnified).]\r\n\r\nAccompanying the passage of glass into stone, various structures\r\nmake their appearance, sometimes distinctly visible to the naked\r\neye, at other times only perceptible with the aid of the microscope.\r\nOne of these structures, known as _Perlitic_ (Fig. 4), consists in\r\nthe formation of minute curved or straight cracks between which the\r\nvitreous or felsitic substance, during its contraction in cooling,\r\nassumed a finely globular form.\r\n\r\nAnother structure, termed _Spherulitic_ (Fig. 5), shows the development\r\nof globules or spherules which may range from grains of microscopic\r\nminuteness up to balls two inches or more in diameter. These not\r\ninfrequently present a well-formed internal fibrous radiation, which\r\ngives a black cross between crossed Nicol prisms. Spherulites are more\r\nespecially developed along the margins of intrusive rocks, and may be\r\nfound in dykes, sills and bosses (see Figs. 375 and 377). Where the\r\ninjected mass is not thick it may be spherulitic to the very centre, as\r\ncan be seen among the felsitic and granophyric dykes of Skye.\r\n\r\nSome felsitic lavas possess a peculiar nodular structure, which was\r\ndeveloped during the process of consolidation. So marked does this\r\narrangement sometimes become that the rocks which display it have\r\nactually been mistaken for conglomerates. It is well exhibited among\r\nthe Lower Silurian lavas of Snowdon, the Upper Silurian lavas of\r\nDingle, and the Lower Old Red Sandstone lavas near Killarney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Micropegmatitic or Granophyric structure in\r\nGranophyre, Mull (magnified).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Ophitic structure in Dolerite, Gortacloghan,\r\nCo. Derry (magnified).]\r\n\r\nA marked structure among some intrusive rocks, especially of an acid\r\ncomposition, is that called _Micropegmatitic_ or _Granophyric_. It\r\nconsists in a minute intergrowth of two component minerals, especially\r\nquartz and felspar, and is more especially characteristic of certain\r\ngranitic or granitoid rocks which have consolidated at some distance\r\nfrom the surface and occur as bosses, sills and dykes. It is also met\r\nwith, however, in some basic sills. Examples of all these and other\r\nstructures will occur in the course of the following description of\r\nBritish volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n(2) The second type of devitrification, conspicuous in rocks of\r\nmore basic composition, is marked by a more complete development of\r\ncrystallization. Among basic, as among acid rocks, there are proofs of\r\nthe consolidation of definite minerals at more than one period. Where\r\nthe molten material has suddenly cooled into a black glass, porphyritic\r\nfelspars or other minerals are often to be seen which were already\r\nfloating in the magma in its molten condition. During devitrification,\r\nhowever, other felspars of a later period of generation made their\r\nappearance, but they are generally distinguishable from their\r\npredecessors. Probably most basic and intermediate rocks, when poured\r\nout at the surface as lavas, were no longer mere vitreous material,\r\nbut had already advanced to various stages of progress towards a stony\r\ncondition. These stages are still to some extent traceable by the aid\r\nof the microscope.\r\n\r\nMicrolites of the component minerals are first developed, which, if the\r\nprocess of aggregation is not arrested, build up more or less perfect\r\ncrystals or crystalline grains of the minerals. Eventually the glass\r\nmay be so completely devitrified by the development of its constituent\r\nminerals as to be wholly used up, the rock then becoming entirely\r\ncrystalline, or to survive only in scanty interstitial spaces. In the\r\nfamily of the basalts and dolerites the gradual transition from a true\r\nglass into a holocrystalline compound may be followed with admirable\r\nclearness. The component minerals have sometimes crystallized in their\r\nown distinct crystallographic forms (idiomorphic); in other cases,\r\nthough thoroughly crystalline, they have assumed externally different\r\nirregular shapes, fitting into each other without their Proper\r\ngeometric boundaries (allotriomorphic).\r\n\r\nA specially characteristic feature of many basic rocks is the presence\r\nof what is termed an _Ophitic_ structure (Fig. 7). Thus the component\r\ncrystals of pyroxene occur as large plates separated and penetrated\r\nby small needles and crystals of felspar. The portions of pyroxene,\r\ndivided by the enclosed felspar, are seen under the microscope to be in\r\noptical continuity, and to have crystallized round the already formed\r\nfelspar. This structure is never found in metamorphic crystalline\r\nrocks. It has been reproduced artificially from fusion by Messrs.\r\nFouqué and Michel Lévy.\r\n\r\nThe name _Variolitic_ is applied to another structure of basic rocks\r\n(Fig. 8), in which, especially towards the margin of eruptive masses,\r\nabundant spheroidal aggregates have been developed from the size of a\r\nmillet-seed to that of a walnut, imbedded in a fine-grained or compact\r\ngreenish matrix into which the kernels seem to shade off. These kernels\r\nconsist of silicates arranged either radially or in concentric zones.\r\n\r\n3. Flow-structure is an arrangement of the crystals, vesicles,\r\nspherulites, or devitrification-streaks in bands or lines, which sweep\r\nround any enclosed object, such as a porphyritic crystal or detached\r\nspherulite, and represent the curving flow of a mobile or viscous mass.\r\nAdmirable examples of this structure may often be observed in old\r\nlavas, as well as in dykes and sills, the streaky lines of flow being\r\nmarked as distinctly as the lines of foam that curve round the boulders\r\nprojecting from the surface of a mountain-brook.\r\n\r\nFlow-structure is most perfectly developed among the obsidians,\r\nrhyolites, felsites and other acid rocks, of which it may be said to\r\nbe a frequently conspicuous character (Fig. 9). In these rocks it is\r\nrevealed by the parallel arrangement of the minute hair-like bodies and\r\ncrystals, or by alternate layers of glassy and lithoid material. The\r\nstreaky lines thus developed are sometimes almost as thin and parallel\r\nas the leaves of a book. But they generally show interruptions and\r\ncurvatures, and may be seen to bend round larger enclosed crystals, or\r\nto gather into eddy-like curves, in such a manner as vividly to portray\r\nthe flow of a viscous substance. These lines represent on a minute\r\nscale the same flow-structure which may be traced in large sheets among\r\nthe lavas. The porphyritic crystals and the spherulites are also drawn\r\nout in rows in the same general direction. Sometimes, indeed, the\r\nspherulites have been so symmetrically grouped in parallel rows that\r\nthey appear as rod-like aggregates which extend along the margin of a\r\ndyke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Variolitic or Orbicular structure, Napoleonite,\r\nCorsica (nat. size).]\r\n\r\nAmong lavas of more basic composition flow-structure is not so often\r\nwell displayed. It most frequently shows itself by the orientation\r\nof porphyritic felspars or of lines of steam-vesicles. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, sheets of basalt may be found in which a distinct streakiness\r\nhas been developed owing to variations in the differentiation of the\r\noriginal molten magma. A remarkable and widespread occurrence of such a\r\nstructure is met with among the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of the Inner\r\nHebrides and the Faroe Islands. In the lower parts of these thick\r\naccumulations of successive lava-sheets, a banded character is so\r\nmarked as to give the rocks the aspect of truly stratified deposits.\r\nThe observer, indeed, can hardly undeceive himself as to their real\r\nnature until he examines them closely. As a full description of this\r\nstructure will be given in a later chapter, it may suffice to state\r\nhere that the banding arises from two causes. In some cellular lavas,\r\nthe vesicles are arranged in layers which lie parallel with the upper\r\nand under surfaces of the sheets. These layers either project as\r\nribs or recede into depressions along the outcrop, and thus impart a\r\ndistinctly stratified aspect to the rock. More frequently, however,\r\nthe banded structure is produced by the alternation of different\r\nvarieties of texture, and even of composition, in the same sheet of\r\nbasalt. Lenticular seams of olivine-basalt may be found intercalated\r\nin a more largely crystalline dolerite. These differences appear to\r\npoint to considerable variations in the constitution of the magma from\r\nwhich the lavas issued--variations which already existed before the\r\ndischarge of these lavas, and which showed themselves in the successive\r\noutflow of basaltic and doleritic material during the eruption of what\r\nwas really, as regards its appearance at the surface, one continuous\r\nstream of molten rock. It is impossible to account for such variations\r\nin the same sheet of lava by any process of differentiation in the\r\nmelted material during its outflow and cooling. Analogous variations\r\noccur among the basic sills and bosses of the Tertiary volcanic series\r\nof Britain. These, as will be more fully discussed in later chapters,\r\nindicate a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the deep-seated\r\nmagma from which the intrusive sheets and bosses were supplied (see\r\nvol. ii. pp. 329, 342).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Flow-structure in Rhyolite, Antrim, slightly\r\nreduced.]\r\n\r\nIt is a common error to assume that flow-structure is a distinctive\r\ncharacter of lavas that have flowed out at the surface. In reality some\r\nof the most perfect examples of the structure occur in dykes and sills,\r\nboth among acid and basic rocks. Innumerable instances might be quoted\r\nfrom the British Isles in support of this statement.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in the vast majority of cases, the presence of flow-structure\r\nmay be confidently assumed to indicate a former molten condition of\r\nthe rock in which it occurs, it is not an absolutely reliable test for\r\nan igneous rock. Experiment has shown that under enormous pressure\r\neven solid metals may be made to flow into cavities prepared for their\r\nreception. Under the vast compression to which the earth's crust is\r\nsubjected during terrestrial contraction, the most obdurate rocks are\r\ncrushed into fragments varying from large blocks to the finest powder.\r\nThis comminuted material is driven along in the direction of thrust,\r\nand when it comes to rest presents a streakiness, with curving lines\r\nof flow round the larger fragments, closely simulating the structure\r\nof many rhyolites and obsidians. It is only by attention to the local\r\nsurroundings that such deceptive resemblances can be assigned to their\r\ntrue cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Lumpy, irregular trachytic Lava-streams\r\n(Carboniferous), East Linton, Haddingtonshire.]\r\n\r\n4. The DISPOSITION OF LAVAS IN SHEETS OR BEDS is the result of\r\nsuccessive outflows of molten rock. Such sheets may range from only a\r\nyard or two to several hundred feet in thickness. As a rule, though\r\nwith many exceptions, the basic lavas, such as the basalts, appear\r\nin thinner beds than the acid forms. This difference is well brought\r\nout if we compare, for instance, the massive rhyolites or felsites of\r\nNorth Wales with the thin sheets of basalt in Antrim and the Inner\r\nHebrides. The regularity of the bedded character is likewise more\r\ndefinite among the basic than among the acid rocks, and this contrast\r\nalso is strikingly illustrated by the two series of rocks just referred\r\nto. The rhyolites and felsites, sometimes also the trachytes and\r\nandesites, assume lumpy, irregular forms, and some little care may be\r\nrequired to trace their upper and under surfaces, and to ascertain\r\nthat they really do form continuous sheets, though varying much in\r\nthickness from place to place (Fig. 10). Like modern acid lavas, they\r\nseem to have flowed out in a pasty condition, and to have been heaped\r\nup round the vents in the form of domes, or with an irregular hummocky\r\nor mounded surface. The basalts, and dolerites, and sometimes the\r\nandesites, have issued in a more fluid condition, and have spread out\r\nin sheets of more uniform thickness, as may be instructively seen in\r\nthe sea-cliffs of Antrim, Mull, Skye, and the Faroe Islands, where the\r\nhorizontal or gently-inclined flows of basalt lie upon each other in\r\neven parallel beds traceable for considerable distances along the face\r\nof the precipices (Figs. 11, 265, and 286). The andesites of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone (Figs. 99, 100) and Carboniferous series (Figs. 107, 108,\r\n111, 112, 113, 123) in Scotland likewise form terraced hills.\r\n\r\nThe length of a lava-stream may vary within wide limits. Sometimes an\r\noutflow of lava has not reached the base of the cone from the side of\r\nwhich it issued, like the obsidian stream on the flanks of the little\r\ncone of the island of Volcano. In other cases, the molten rock has\r\nflowed for forty or fifty miles, like the copious Icelandic lava-floods\r\nof 1783. In the basalt-plateaux of the Inner Hebrides a single sheet\r\nmay sometimes be traced for several miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--View at the entrance of the Svinofjord, Faroe\r\nIslands, illustrating the terraced forms assumed by basic lavas.\r\n\r\nThe island on the left is Borö, that in the centre Viderö, and that on\r\nthe right Svinö.]\r\n\r\nSome lavas, more especially among the basic series, assume in cooling\r\na _Columnar structure_, of which two types may be noticed. In one of\r\nthese the columns pass with regularity and parallelism from the top\r\nto the bottom of a bed (Figs. 171, 225). The basalt in which Fingal's\r\nCave, in the isle of Staffa, has been hollowed out may be taken as a\r\ncharacteristic example (Fig. 266a). Not infrequently the columns are\r\ncurved, as at the well-known Clam-shell Cave of Staffa. In the other\r\ntype, the columns or prisms are not persistent, but die out into\r\neach other and have a wavy, irregular shape, somewhat like prisms of\r\nstarch. These two types may occur in successive sheets of basalt,\r\nor may even pass into each other. At Staffa the regularly columnar\r\nbed is immediately overlain with one of the starch-like character.\r\nThe columnar structure in either case is a contraction phenomenon,\r\nproduced during the cooling and shrinking of the lava. But it is\r\ndifficult to say what special conditions in the lava were required for\r\nits production, or why it should sometimes have assumed the regular,\r\nat others the irregular form. It may be found not only in superficial\r\nlavas but in equal perfection in some dykes and intrusive sills or\r\ninjections, as among the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the island of Canna\r\n(Figs. 307 and 308).\r\n\r\nThe precipitation of a lava-stream into a lake or the sea may cause\r\nthe outer crust of the rock to break up with violence, so that the\r\nstill molten material inside may rush into the water. Some basic lavas\r\non flowing into water or into a watery silt have assumed a remarkable\r\nspheroidal sack-like or pillow-like structure, the spheroids being\r\nsometimes pressed into shapes like piles of sacks. A good instance\r\nof this structure occurs in a basalt at Acicastello in Sicily.[1] A\r\nsimilar appearance will be described in a later chapter as peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of certain Lower Silurian lavas associated with\r\nradiolarian cherts in Britain and in other countries (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Prof. G. Platania in Dr. Johnston-Lavis' _South\r\nItalian Volcanoes_, Naples (1891), p. 41 and plate xii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Sack-like or pillow-form structure of basic\r\nlavas (Lower Silurian), Bennan Head, Ballantrae, Ayrshire.]\r\n\r\nIt probably seldom happens that a solitary sheet of lava occurs among\r\nnon-volcanic sedimentary strata, with no other indication around it\r\nof former volcanic activity. Such an isolated record does not seem\r\nto have been met with in the remarkably ample volcanic register of\r\nthe British Isles. The outpouring of molten rock has generally been\r\naccompanied with the ejection of fragmentary materials. Hence among the\r\nmemorials of volcanic eruptions, while intercalated lavas are generally\r\nassociated with sheets of tuff, bands of tuff may not infrequently\r\nbe encountered in a sedimentary series without any lava. Instances\r\nin illustration of these statements may be culled from the British\r\nPalæozoic formations back even into the Cambrian system.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of some interest in connection with the flow\r\nof lava is the effect produced by it on the underlying rocks. If these\r\nare not firmly compacted they may be ploughed up or even dislocated.\r\nThus the tuffs of the Velay have sometimes been plicated, inverted,\r\nand fractured by the movement of a flowing current of basalt.[2] The\r\ngreat heat of the lava has frequently induced considerable alteration\r\nupon the underlying rocks. Induration is the most common result, often\r\naccompanied with a reddening of the altered substance. Occasionally\r\na beautifully prismatic structure has been developed in the soft\r\nmaterial immediately beneath a basalt, as in ferruginous clay near the\r\nvillage of Esplot in the Velay, in which the close-set columns are 50\r\ncentimetres long and 4 to 5 centimetres in diameter.[3] Changes of this\r\nnature, however, are more frequent among sills than among superficial\r\nlavas. Many examples of them may be gathered from the Scottish\r\nCarboniferous districts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: M. Boule, _Bull. Cart. Géol. France_, No. 28, tom. iv.\r\n(1892), p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: M. Boule. _Op. cit._ p. 234.]\r\n\r\nVariations of structure in single lava-sheets.--From what has been said\r\nabove in regard to certain kinds of flow-structure among basic rocks,\r\nit will be evident that some considerable range of chemical, but more\r\nparticularly of mineralogical, composition may be sometimes observed\r\neven within the same sheet of lava. Such differences, it is true,\r\nare more frequent among intrusive rocks, especially thick sills and\r\nlarge bosses. But they have been met with in so many instances among\r\nsuperficial lavas as to show that they are the results of some general\r\nlaw, which probably has a wide application among the surface-products\r\nof volcanic action. Scrope expressed the opinion that in the focus of\r\na volcano there may be a kind of filtration of the constituents of a\r\nmolten mass, the heavier minerals sinking through the lighter, so that\r\nthe upper portions of the mass will become more felspathic and the\r\nlower parts more augitic and ferruginous.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Volcanoes_, p. 125.]\r\n\r\nLeopold von Buch found that in some of the highly glassy lavas of the\r\nCanary Islands the felspar increases towards the bottom of the mass,\r\nbecoming so abundant as almost to exclude the matrix, and giving rise\r\nto a compound that might be mistaken for a primitive rock.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Description Physique des Isles Canaries_ (1836), p. 190.]\r\n\r\nDarwin observed that in a grey basalt filling up the hollow of an\r\nold crater in James Island, one of the Galapagos group, the felspar\r\ncrystals became much more abundant in the lower scoriaceous part, and\r\nhe discussed the question of the descent of crystals by virtue of their\r\nspecific gravity through a still molten lava.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands_ (1844), p.\r\n117.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence King during a visit to Hawaii found that in every case\r\nwhere he broke newly-congealed streamlets of lava, \"the bottom of the\r\nflow was thickly crowded with triclinic felspars and augites, while\r\nthe whole upper part of the stream was of nearly pure isotropic and\r\nacid glass.\"[7] This subject will be again referred to when we come to\r\ndiscuss the characters of intrusive sills and bosses, for it is among\r\nthem that the most marked petrographical variations may be observed.\r\nExamples will be cited both from the intrusive and extrusive volcanic\r\ngroups of Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _U.S. Geol. Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel_, vol. i.\r\n(1878), p. 716.]\r\n\r\nVolcanic cycles.--Closely related to the problem of the range of\r\nstructure and composition in a single mass of lava is another problem\r\npresented by the remarkable sequence of different types of lava which\r\nare erupted within a given district during a single volcanic period.\r\nNearly thirty years ago Baron von Richthofen drew attention to the\r\nsequence of volcanic materials erupted within the same geographical\r\narea. He showed, more especially from observations in Western America,\r\nthat a definite order of appearance in the successive species of lava\r\ncould be established, the earliest eruptions consisting of materials\r\nof an intermediate or average composition, and those of subsequent\r\noutflows becoming on the whole progressively more acid, but finishing\r\nby an abrupt transition to a basic type. His sequence was as follows:\r\n1. Propylite; 2. Andesite; 3. Trachyte; 4. Rhyolite; 5. Basalt.[8]\r\nThis generalisation has been found to hold good over wide regions of\r\nthe Old World as well as the New. It is not, however, of universal\r\napplication.[9] Examples are not uncommon of an actual alternation of\r\nacid and basic lavas from the same, or at least from adjacent vents.\r\nSuch an alternation occurs among the Tertiary eruptions of Central\r\nFrance and among those of Old Red Sandstone age in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Trans. Acad. California_, 1868. Prof. Iddings' _Journ.\r\nGeol._, vol. i. (1893), p. 606.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See Prof. Brögger, \"Die Eruptivgesteine des\r\nKristianiagebietes,\" part ii. (1895), p. 175; _Zeitsch. Kryst. und\r\nMineral_, vol. xvi. (1890) p. 83. This author would, from this point\r\nof view, draw a distinction between rocks which have consolidated deep\r\nwithin the earth and those which have flowed out at the surface, since\r\nhe thinks that we are not justified in applying our experience of the\r\norder of sequence in the one series to the other. Yet there can be\r\nno doubt that in many old volcanic districts the masses that may be\r\npresumed to have consolidated at a great depth have been in unbroken\r\nconnection with masses that reached the surface. These latter, as Prof.\r\nIddings has urged, furnish a much larger body of evidence than the\r\nintrusive sheets and bosses.]\r\n\r\nThe range of variation in the nature of the eruptive rocks during the\r\nwhole of a volcanic period in any district may be termed \"a volcanic\r\ncycle.\" In Britain, where the records of many volcanic periods have\r\nbeen preserved, a number of such cycles may be studied. In this way\r\nthe evolution of the subterranean magma during one geological age may\r\nbe compared with that of another. It will be one of the objects of the\r\nfollowing chapters to trace out this evolution in each period where\r\nthe requisite materials for the purpose are available. We shall find\r\nthat back to Archæan time a number of distinct cycles may be observed,\r\ndiffering in many respects from each other, but agreeing in the general\r\norder of development of the successive eruptions. Leaving these British\r\nexamples for future consideration, it may be useful to cite here a few\r\nfrom the large series now collected from the European continent and\r\nNorth America.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Prof. M. Bertrand in a suggestive paper published in\r\n1888 dealt with the general order of appearance of eruptive rocks in\r\ndifferent provinces of Europe. But the materials then at his command\r\nprobably did not warrant him in offering more than a sketch of the\r\nsubject, _Bull. Soc. Geol._, France, xvi. p. 573. In the same volume\r\nthere is a paper by M. Le Verrier, who announces his opinion that the\r\neruption of the basic rocks takes place in times of terrestrial calm,\r\nwhile that of the acid rocks occurs in periods of great disturbance,\r\n_op. cit._ p. 498. Compare also Prof. Brögger, _Die Eruptivgesteine des\r\nKristianiagebietes_, ii. p. 169.]\r\n\r\nAmong the older rocks of the European continent, Prof. Brögger\r\nhas shown that in the Christiania district the eruptive rocks\r\nwhich traverse the Cambrian and Silurian formations began with the\r\noutburst of basic material such as melaphyre, augite-porphyrite, and\r\ngabbro-diabase, having from about 44 to about 52 per cent of silica.\r\nThese were followed by rocks with a silica-percentage ranging from\r\nabout 50 to 61, including some characteristic Norwegian rocks, like the\r\nrhomben-porphyry. The acidity continued to increase, for in the next\r\nseries of eruptions the silica-percentage rose to between 60 and 67,\r\nthe characteristic rock being a quartz-syenite. Then came deep-seated\r\nprotrusions of highly acid rocks, varieties of granite, containing\r\nfrom 68 to 75 per cent of silica. The youngest eruptive masses in the\r\ndistrict show a complete change of character. They are basic dykes\r\n(proterobase, diabase, etc.).[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Eruptivgest. Kristianiageb._, 1895.]\r\n\r\nThe same author institutes a comparison between the post-Silurian\r\neruptive series of Christiania and that of the Triassic system in the\r\nTyrol, and believes that the two cycles closely agree.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Op. cit._ He supposes in each case the pre-existence of\r\na parent magma from which the eruptive series started and which had\r\na silica-percentage of about 64 or 65. In this difficult subject it\r\nis of the utmost importance to accumulate fact before proceeding to\r\nspeculation.]\r\n\r\nDuring Tertiary time in Central France more than one cycle may be\r\nmade out in distinct districts. Thus in the Velay, during the Miocene\r\nPeriod, volcanic activity began with the outpouring of basalts,\r\nfollowed successively by trachytes, labradorites and augitic andesites,\r\nphonolites and basalts. The Pliocene eruptions showed a reversion to\r\nthe intermediate types of augitic andesites and trachytes, followed by\r\nabundant basalts, which continued to be poured forth in Pleistocene\r\ntime.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: M. Boule, \"Description Géologique du Velay,\" _Bull.\r\nCarte. Géol. France_, 1892. This author draws special attention to the\r\nevidence for the alternation of basic and more acid material in the\r\nTertiary eruptions of Central France.]\r\n\r\nFurther north, in Auvergne, where the eruptions come down to a later\r\nperiod, the volcanic sequence appears to have been first a somewhat\r\nacid group of lavas (trachytes or domites), followed by a series of\r\nbasalts, then by andesites and labradorites, the latest outflows again\r\nconsisting of basalts.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: M. Michel Lévy, _Bull. Soc. Géol. France_, 1890, p. 704.]\r\n\r\nNot less striking is the succession of lavas in the Yellowstone\r\nregion, as described by Mr. Iddings. The first eruptions consisted\r\nof andesites. These were followed by abundant discharges of basalt,\r\nsucceeded by later outflows of andesite, and of basalt like that\r\npreviously erupted. After a period of extensive erosion, occupying a\r\nprolonged interval of time, volcanic energy was renewed by the eruption\r\nof a vast flood of rhyolite, after which came a feebler outflow of\r\nbasalt that brought the cycle to a close, though geysers and fumaroles\r\nshow that the volcanic fires are not yet entirely extinguished\r\nbelow.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Journal of Geology_, Chicago, i. (1893) p. 606. See\r\nalso this author's excellent monograph on \"Electric Peak and Sepulchre\r\nMountain,\" _12th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1890-91), and Mr. H.\r\nW. Turner on \"The Succession of Tertiary Volcanic Rocks in the Sierra\r\nNevada of North America,\" _14th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1892-93),\r\np. 493.]\r\n\r\nBut not only is there evidence of a remarkable evolution or succession\r\nor erupted material within the volcanic cycle of a single geological\r\nperiod. One of the objects of the present work is to bring forward\r\nproofs that such cycles have succeeded each other again and again,\r\nat widely separated intervals, within the same region. After the\r\ncompletion of a cycle and the relapse of volcanic energy into repose,\r\nthere has been a renewal of the previous condition of the subterranean\r\nmagma, giving rise ultimately to a similar succession of erupted\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nIf we are at a loss to account for the changes in the sequence of\r\nlavas during a single volcanic cycle, our difficulties are increased\r\nwhen we find that in some way the magma is restored each time to\r\nsomewhat the same initial condition. Analogies may be traced between\r\nthe differentiation which has taken place within a plutonic intrusive\r\nboss or sill and the sequence of lavas in volcanic cycles. It can be\r\nshown that though the original magma that supplied the intrusive mass\r\nmay be supposed to have had a fairly uniform composition deep down in\r\nits reservoir, differentiation set in long before the intrusive mass\r\nconsolidated, the more basic constituents travelling outwards to the\r\nmargin and leaving the central parts more acid. If some such process\r\ntakes place within a lava-reservoir, it may account for a sequence of\r\nvariations in composition. But this would not meet all the difficulties\r\nof the case, nor explain the determining cause of the separation of the\r\nconstituents within the reservoir of molten rock, whether arising from\r\ntemperature, specific gravity, or other influence. This subject will be\r\nfurther considered in connection with intrusive Bosses.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which may be regarded as now well established is\r\nthe persistence of composition and structure in the lavas of all\r\nages. Notwithstanding the oft-repeated cycles in the character of\r\nthe magma, the materials erupted to the surface, whether acid or\r\nbasic, have retained with wonderful uniformity the same fundamental\r\ncharacteristics. No part of the contribution of British geology to the\r\nelucidation of the history of volcanic action is of more importance\r\nthan the evidence which it furnishes for this persistent sameness of\r\nthe subterranean magma. An artificial line has sometimes been drawn\r\nbetween the volcanic products of Tertiary time and those of earlier\r\nages. But a careful study of the eruptive rocks of Britain shows that\r\nno such line of division is based upon any fundamental differences.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of Palæozoic time have of course been far longer exposed\r\nto alterations of every kind than those of the Tertiary periods, and\r\ncertain superficial distinctions may be made between them. But when\r\nthese accidental differences are eliminated, we find that the oldest\r\nknown lavas exhibit the same types of structure and composition\r\nthat are familiar in those of Tertiary and recent volcanoes. Many\r\nillustrations of this statement will be furnished in later chapters.\r\nAs a particularly striking instance, I may cite here the most ancient\r\nand most modern lavas of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado. Mr. Walcott\r\nand Mr. Iddings have shown that in the Lower Cambrian, or possibly\r\npre-Cambrian, formations of that great gorge, certain basic lavas\r\nwere contemporaneously interstratified, which, in spite of their vast\r\nantiquity, are only slightly different from the modern basalts that\r\nhave been poured over the surrounding plateau.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _14th Annual Report U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1892-93).]\r\n\r\nThe chief lavas found in Britain.--Of the lavas which have been\r\npoured out at the surface within the region of the British Isles, the\r\nfollowing varieties are of most frequent occurrence. In the acid series\r\nare Rhyolites and Felsites, but the vitreous forms are probably all\r\nintrusive. The intermediate series is represented by Trachytes and\r\nAndesites (Porphyrites), which range from a glassy to a holocrystalline\r\nstructure. The basic series includes Dolerites, Diabases, Basalts,\r\nLimburgites (or Magma-basalts, containing little or no felspar), and\r\nPicrites or other varieties of Peridotites. The intrusive rocks display\r\na greater variety of composition and structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. VOLCANIC AGGLOMERATES, BRECCIAS AND TUFFS\r\n\r\nThe coarser fragmentary materials thrown from volcanic vents are known\r\nas Agglomerates where they show no definite arrangement, and especially\r\nwhere they actually fill up the old funnels of discharge. When they\r\nhave accumulated in sheets or strata of angular detritus outside an\r\nactive vent they are termed Breccias, or if their component stones have\r\nbeen water-worn, Conglomerates. The finer ejected materials may be\r\ncomprehended under the general name of Tuffs.\r\n\r\nAlthough these various forms of pyroclastic detritus consist as a\r\nrule of thoroughly volcanic material, they may include fragments of\r\nnon-volcanic rocks. This is especially the case among those which\r\nrepresent the earliest explosions of a volcano. The first efforts to\r\nestablish an eruptive vent lead to the shattering of the terrestrial\r\ncrust, and the consequent discharge of abundant debris of that crust.\r\nThe breccias or agglomerates thus produced may contain, indeed, little\r\nor no truly volcanic material, but may be made up of fragments of\r\ngranite, gneiss, sandstone, limestone, shale, or whatever may happen to\r\nbe the rocks through which the eruptive orifice has been drilled. If\r\nthe first explosions exhausted the energy of the vent, it may happen\r\nthat the only discharges from it consisted merely of non-volcanic\r\ndebris. Examples of this kind have been cited from various old volcanic\r\ndistricts. A striking case occurs at Sepulchre Mountain in the\r\nYellowstone Park, where the lower breccias, the product of the earliest\r\nexplosions of the Electric Peak volcano, and attaining a thickness of\r\n500 feet, are full of pieces of the Archæan rocks which underlie the\r\nyounger formations of that district.[17] These non-volcanic stones do\r\nnot occur among the breccias higher up. Obviously, however, though\r\nmost abundant at first, pieces of the underlying rocks may reappear in\r\nsubsequent discharges, wherever by the energy of explosion, fragments\r\nare broken from the walls of a volcanic chimney and hurled out of the\r\ncrater. Illustrations of these features will be given in the account of\r\nthe British Carboniferous, Permian and Tertiary volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Prof. J. P. Iddings, _12th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_\r\n(1890-91), p. 634.]\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that where the component materials of such\r\nfragmentary accumulations consist entirely of non-volcanic rocks, great\r\ncaution must be exercised in attributing them to volcanic agency. Two\r\nsources of error in such cases may here be pointed out. In the first\r\nplace, where angular detritus has been precipitated into still water,\r\nas, for instance, from a crag or rocky declivity into a lake, a very\r\ncoarse and tumultuous kind of breccia may be formed. It is conceivable\r\nthat, in course of time, such a breccia may be buried under ordinary\r\nsediments, and may thereby be preserved, while all trace of its parent\r\nprecipice may have disappeared. The breccia might resemble some true\r\nvolcanic agglomerates, but the resemblance would be entirely deceptive.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, notice must be taken of the frequent results\r\nof movements within the terrestrial crust, whereby rocks have not\r\nonly been ruptured but, as already pointed out, have been crushed\r\ninto fragments. In this way, important masses of breccia or\r\nconglomerate have been formed, sometimes running for a number of\r\nmiles and attaining a breadth of several hundred feet. The stones,\r\noften in huge blocks, have been derived from the surrounding rocks,\r\nand while sometimes angular, are sometimes well-rounded. They are\r\nimbedded in a finer matrix of the same material, and may be scattered\r\npromiscuously through the mass, in such a way as to present the closest\r\nresemblance to true volcanic breccia. Where the crushed material has\r\nincluded ancient igneous rocks it might deceive even an experienced\r\ngeologist. Indeed, some rocks which have been mapped and described as\r\nvolcanic tuffs or agglomerates are now known to be only examples of\r\n\"crush-conglomerates.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: For an account of \"crush-conglomerates,\" see Mr.\r\nLamplugh's paper on those of the Isle of Man, _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._, li. (1895), p. 563. Mr. M'Henry has pointed to probable cases of\r\nmistake of this kind in Ireland, _Nature_, 5th March 1896. A. Geikie,\r\n_Geol. Mag._ November 1896.]\r\n\r\nNot only have vast quantities of detritus of non-volcanic rocks been\r\nshot forth from volcanic vents, but sometimes enormous solid masses of\r\nrock have been brought up by ascending lavas or have been ejected by\r\nexplosive vapours. Every visitor to the puys of Auvergne will remember\r\nthe great cliff-like prominence of granite and mica-schist which, as\r\ndescribed long ago by Scrope, has been carried up by the trachyte of\r\nthe Puy Chopine, and forms one of the summits of the dome (Fig. 344).\r\nThe same phenomenon is observable at the Puy de Montchar, where large\r\nblocks of granite have been transported from the underlying platform.\r\nAbich has described some remarkable examples in the region of Erzeroum.\r\nThe huge crater of Palandokän, 9687 feet above the sea contains, in\r\ncliff-like projections from its walls as well as scattered over its\r\nuneven bottom, great masses of marmorised limestone and alabaster,\r\nassociated with pieces of the green chloritic schists, serpentines\r\nand gabbros of the underlying non-volcanic platform. These rocks,\r\nwhich form an integral part of the structure of the crater, have been\r\ncarried up by masses of trachydoleritic, andesitic and quartz-trachytic\r\nlavas.[19] Examples will be given in a later chapter showing how\r\ngigantic blocks of mica-schist and other rocks have been carried many\r\nhundred feet upwards and buried among sheets of lava or masses of\r\nagglomerates during the Tertiary volcanic period in Britain (Fig. 262).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Abich, _Geologie des Armenischen Hochlandes_ (Part ii.,\r\nwestern half), 1882, p. 76.]\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, the fragmentary substances ejected\r\nby ancient volcanic explosions, like those of the present day, have\r\nconsisted wholly or mainly of material which existed in a molten\r\ncondition within the earth, and which has been violently expelled to\r\nthe surface. Such ejected detritus varies from the finest impalpable\r\ndust or powder up to huge masses of solid rock. These various materials\r\nmay come from more than one source. Where a volcanic orifice is blown\r\nout through already solidified lavas belonging to previous eruptions,\r\nthe fragments of these lavas may accumulate within or around the vent,\r\nand be gradually consolidated into agglomerate or breccia. Again,\r\nexplosions within the funnel may break up lava-crusts that have there\r\nformed over the cooling upper surface of the column of molten rock. Or\r\nthe uprising lava in the chimney may be spurted out in lumps of slag\r\nand bombs, or may be violently blown out in the form of minute lapilli,\r\nor of extremely fine dust and ashes.\r\n\r\nAlthough in theory these several varieties of origin may be\r\ndiscriminated, it is hardly possible always to distinguish them among\r\nthe products of ancient volcanic action. In the great majority of cases\r\nold tuffs, having been originally deposited in water, have undergone\r\na good deal of decomposition, and such early alteration has been\r\naggravated by the subsequent influence of percolating meteoric water.\r\n\r\nWhere disintegration has not proceeded too far, the finer particles of\r\ntuffs may be seen to consist of minute angular pieces of altered glass,\r\nor of microlites or crystals, or of some vitreous or semi-vitreous\r\nsubstance, in which such microlites and crystals are enclosed. It has\r\nalready been stated that the occurrence of glass, or of any substance\r\nwhich has resulted from the devitrification of glass, may be taken as\r\ngood evidence of former volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nMost commonly, especially in the case of tuffs of high antiquity, like\r\nthose associated with the Palæozoic formations, the fresh glassy and\r\nmicrolitic constituents, so conspicuous in modern volcanic ashes, are\r\nhardly to be recognised. The finer dust which no doubt contained these\r\ncharacteristic substances has generally passed into dull, earthy,\r\ngranular, or structureless material, though here and there, among basic\r\ntuffs, remaining as palagonite. In the midst of this decayed matrix,\r\nthe lapilli of disrupted lavas may endure, but it may be difficult or\r\nimpossible to decide whether they were derived from the breaking up of\r\nolder lavas by explosion, or from the blowing out of the lava-crusts\r\nwithin the funnel.\r\n\r\nThe cellular structure, which we have seen to be a markedly volcanic\r\npeculiarity among the lavas, is not less so in their fragments among\r\nthe agglomerates, breccias and tuffs; indeed it may be said to be\r\neminently characteristic of them. The vesicles in the lapilli, bombs,\r\nand blocks are sometimes of large size, as in masses of ejected slag,\r\nbut they range down to microscopic minuteness. The lapilli of many old\r\ntuffs are sometimes so crowded with such minute pores, as to show that\r\nthey were originally true pumice.\r\n\r\nThe composition of tuffs must obviously depend upon that of the lavas\r\nfrom which they were derived. But their frequently decayed condition\r\nmakes it less easy, in their case, to draw definite boundary-lines\r\nbetween varieties. In a group of acid lavas, the tuffs may be expected\r\nto be also acid, while among intermediate or basic lavas, the tuffs\r\nwill generally be found to correspond. There are, however, exceptions\r\nto this general rule. As will be afterwards described in detail,\r\nabundant felsitic tuffs may be seen among the andesitic lavas of Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone age in Scotland, and rhyolitic tuffs occur also among\r\nthe Tertiary basalts of Antrim.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, basic and intermediate tuffs, like the lavas from which\r\nthey have been derived, are rather more prone to decomposition than\r\nthe acid varieties. One of their most characteristic features is the\r\npresence in them of lapilli of a minutely vesicular pumice, which will\r\nbe more particularly described in connection with volcanic necks, of\r\nwhich it is a characteristic constituent. Occasional detached crystals\r\nof volcanic minerals, either entire or broken, may be detected in\r\nthem, though perhaps less frequently than in the agglomerates. The\r\nearthy matrix is generally greenish in colour, varying into shades of\r\nbrick-red, purple and brown.\r\n\r\nThe acid tuffs are, on the whole, paler in colour than the others,\r\nsometimes indeed they are white or pale grey, but graduate into\r\ntones of hæmatitic red or brown, the varying ferruginous tints being\r\nindicative of stages in the oxidation of the iron-bearing constituent\r\nminerals. Small rounded lapilli or angular fragments of felsite or\r\nrhyolite may be noticed among them, sometimes exhibiting the most\r\nperfect flow-structure. As typical examples of such tuffs, I may refer\r\nto those of the Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, and those that lie\r\nbetween the two groups of basalt in Antrim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Alternations of coarser and finer Tuff.]\r\n\r\nThrown out promiscuously from active vents, the materials that form\r\ntuffs arrange themselves, on the whole, according to relative size\r\nover the surface on which they come to rest, the largest being\r\ngenerally grouped nearest to the focus of discharge, and the finest\r\nextending farthest from it. As the volcanoes of which records have been\r\npreserved among the geological formations were chiefly subaqueous, the\r\nfragmentary substances, as they fell into water, would naturally be to\r\nsome extent spread out by the action of currents or waves. They would\r\nthus tend to take a more or less distinctly stratified arrangement.\r\nMoreover, as during an eruption there might be successive paroxysms\r\nof violence in the discharges, coarser and finer detritus would\r\nsuccessively fall over the same spot. In this way, rapid alternations\r\nof texture would arise (Fig. 13). A little experience will enable the\r\nobserver to distinguish between such truly volcanic variations and\r\nthose of ordinary sedimentation, where, for instance, layers of gravel\r\nand sand repeatedly alternate. Besides the volcanic nature of the\r\nfragments and their non-water-worn forms, he will notice that here and\r\nthere the larger blocks may be placed on end--a position the reverse\r\nof that usual in the disposal of aqueous sediments, but one which is\r\nnot infrequently assumed by ejected stones, even when they fall through\r\nsome little depth of water. Further, the occurrence of large pieces of\r\nlava, scattered at random through deposits of fine tuff, would lead him\r\nto recognize the tumultuous discharges of a volcanic focus, rather than\r\nthe sorting and sifting action of moving water.\r\n\r\nAdmirable illustrations of these various characteristics may be\r\ngathered in endless number from the Palæozoic volcanic chronicles of\r\nBritain. I may especially cite the basin of the Firth of Forth as a\r\nclassical region for the study of Carboniferous examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Alternations of Tuff (_t_, _t_,) with\r\nnon-volcanic sediment (_l_, _l_).]\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions of modern volcanic eruptions are considered, it\r\nwill be seen that where ejected ashes and stones fall into water, they\r\nwill there mingle with any ordinary sediment that may be in course\r\nof deposition at the time. There will thus be a blending of volcanic\r\nand non-volcanic detritus, and the transition between the two may be\r\nso insensible that no hard line of demarcation can be drawn. Such\r\nintermingling has continually taken place during past ages. One of the\r\nfirst lessons learnt by the geologist, who begins the study of ancient\r\nvolcanic records, is the necessity of recognizing this gradation of\r\nmaterial, and likewise the frequently recurring alternations of true\r\ntuff with shale, sandstone, limestone or other entirely non-volcanic\r\ndetritus (Fig. 14). He soon perceives that such facts as these furnish\r\nhim with some of the most striking proofs of the reality and progress\r\nof former eruptions. The intermingling of much ordinary detritus\r\nwith the volcanic material may be regarded as indicative either of\r\ncomparatively feeble activity, or at least of considerable distance\r\nfrom the focus of discharge. It is sometimes possible to trace such\r\nintermixtures through gradually augmenting proportions of volcanic dust\r\nand stones, until the deposit becomes wholly volcanic in composition,\r\nand so coarse in texture as to indicate the proximity of the eruptive\r\nvent. On the other hand, the gradual decrease of the volcanic ejections\r\ncan be followed in the upward sequence of a series of stratified\r\ndeposits, until the whole material becomes entirely non-volcanic.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of thin partings of tuff between ordinary sedimentary\r\nstrata points to occasional intermittent eruptions of ashes or stones,\r\nthe vigour and duration of each eruptive interval being roughly\r\nindicated by the thickness and coarseness of the volcanic detritus.\r\nThe pauses in the volcanic activity allowed the deposit of ordinary\r\nsediment to proceed unchecked. The nature of such non-volcanic\r\nintercalations gives a clue to the physical conditions of sedimentation\r\nat the time, while their thickness affords some indication of the\r\nrelative duration of the periods of volcanic repose.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will convince the observer that in such a section\r\nas that represented in Fig. 14 the volcanic intercalations must be\r\nregarded as a mere local accident. Evidently the normal conditions\r\nof sedimentation at the time these strata were accumulated are\r\nindicated by the limestone bands (_l_, _l_). Had there been no volcanic\r\neruptions, a continuous mass of limestone would have been deposited,\r\nbut this continuity was from time to time interrupted by the explosions\r\nthat gave rise to the intercalated bands of tuff (_t_, _t_).\r\n\r\nThe application of these rules of geological evidence will be best\r\nunderstood from actual examples of their use. Many illustrations of\r\nthem will be subsequently given, more especially from the volcanic\r\nrecords of the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting peculiarities of interstratified tuffs is\r\nthe not infrequent occurrence of the remains of plants and animals\r\nimbedded in them. Such remains would have been entombed in the ordinary\r\nsediment had there been no volcanic eruptions, and their presence in\r\nthe tuffs is another convincing proof of contemporaneous volcanic\r\naction during the deposition of a sedimentary series. But they may\r\nbe made to furnish much more information as to the chronology of the\r\neruptions and the physical geography of the localities where the\r\nvolcanoes were active, as will be set forth farther on.\r\n\r\nTuffs, as already remarked, frequently occur without any accompaniment\r\nof lava, although lavas seldom appear without some tuff. We thus\r\nlearn that in the past, as at present, discharges of fragmentary\r\nmaterials alone were more common than the outflow of lava by itself.\r\nThe relative proportions of the lavas and tuffs in a volcanic series\r\nvary indefinitely. In the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of Britain,\r\nthe lavas succeed each other, sheet above sheet, for hundreds of\r\nfeet, with few and trifling fragmental intercalations. Among the\r\nCarboniferous volcanic ejections, on the other hand, many solitary or\r\nsuccessive bands of tuff may be observed without any visible sheets\r\nof lava. Viewed broadly, however, in their general distribution\r\nduring geological time, the two great groups of volcanic material may\r\nbe regarded as having generally appeared together. In all the great\r\nvolcanic series, from the base of the Palæozoic systems up to the\r\nTertiary plateaux, lavas and tuffs are found associated, much as they\r\nare among the ejections of modern volcanoes. They often alternate, and\r\nthus furnish evidence as to oscillations of energy at the eruptive\r\nvents.\r\n\r\nNow and then, by the explosions from a volcano at the present day, a\r\nsingle stone may be ejected at such an angle and with such force as to\r\nfall to the ground at a long distance from the vent. In like manner,\r\namong the volcanic records of former periods, we may occasionally\r\ncome upon a single block of lava imbedded among tuffs or even in\r\nnon-volcanic strata. Where such a stone has fallen upon soft sediment,\r\nit can be seen to have sunk into it, pressing down the layers beneath\r\nit, and having the subsequently deposited layers heaped over it. An\r\nejected block of this nature is represented among the tuffs shown in\r\nFig. 13. Another instance from a group of non-volcanic sediments is\r\ngiven in Fig. 15, and is selected from a number of illustrations of\r\nthis interesting feature which have been observed among the Lower\r\nCarboniferous formations of the basin of the Firth of Forth. A solitary\r\nblock, imbedded in a series of strata, would not, of course, by itself\r\nafford a demonstration of volcanic activity. There are various ways\r\nin which such stones may be transported and dropped over a muddy\r\nwater-bottom. They may, for example, be floated off attached to\r\nsea-weeds, or wrapped round by the roots of trees. But where a block\r\nof basalt or other volcanic rock has obviously descended with such\r\nforce as to crush down the deposits on which it fell, and when lavas\r\nand tuffs are known to exist in the vicinity, there can be little\r\nhesitation in regarding such a block as having been ejected from a\r\nneighbouring vent, either during an explosion of exceptional violence\r\nor with an unusually low angle of projection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Ejected block of Basalt which has fallen among\r\nCarboniferous shales and limestones, shore, Pettycur, Fife.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, reference may conveniently be made here to another\r\nvariety of fragmental volcanic materials which cannot always be\r\nsatisfactorily distinguished from true tuffs, although arising from a\r\nthoroughly non-volcanic agency. Where a mass of lava has been exposed\r\nto denudation, as, for instance, when a volcanic island has been\r\nformed in a lake or in the sea, the detritus worn away from it may be\r\nspread out like any other kind of sediment. Though derived from the\r\ndegradation of lava, such a mechanical deposit is not properly a tuff,\r\nnor can it even be included among strictly volcanic formations. It may\r\nbe called a volcanic conglomerate, rhyolitic conglomerate, diabase\r\nsandstone, felsitic shale, or by any other name that will adequately\r\ndenote its composition and texture. But it may not afford proof of\r\nstrictly contemporaneous volcanic activity. All that we are entitled\r\nto infer from such a deposit is that, at the time when it was laid\r\ndown, volcanic rocks of a certain kind were exposed at the surface and\r\nwere undergoing degradation. But the date of their original eruption\r\nmay have been long previous to that of the formation of the detrital\r\ndeposit from their waste.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is sometimes possible to make sure that the\r\nconglomerate or sandstone, though wholly due to the mechanical\r\ndestruction of already erupted lavas, was in a general sense\r\ncontemporaneous with the volcanoes that gave forth these lavas.\r\nThe detrital formation may be traced perhaps up to the lavas from\r\nwhich it was derived, and may be found to be intercalated in the\r\nsame sedimentary series with which they are associated. Or it may\r\ncontain large bombs and slags, such as most probably came either\r\ndirectly from explosions or from the washing down of cinder-cones or\r\nother contemporaneously existing volcanic heaps. Examples of such\r\nintercalated conglomerates will be given from the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone of Central Scotland and from the Tertiary volcanic plateaux\r\nof the Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  Materials erupted at the Surface--Extrusive Series--_continued_.\r\n     iii.

How\r\n     the Physical Geography associated with ancient Volcanoes is\r\n     ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now taken note of the various materials ejected to the surface\r\nfrom volcanic orifices, we may pass to the consideration of these\r\norifices themselves, with the view of ascertaining under what various\r\nconditions volcanic action has taken place in the geological past. We\r\nhave seen that modern and not long extinct volcanoes may be grouped\r\ninto three types, and a study of the records of ancient volcanoes shows\r\nthat the same types may be recognized in the eruptions of former ages.\r\nThe following chapters will supply many illustrations of each type from\r\nthe geological history of the British Isles. In dealing with these\r\nillustrations, however, we must ever bear in mind the all-powerful\r\ninfluence of denudation. We ought not to expect to meet with the\r\noriginal forms of the volcanoes. Some little reflection and experience\r\nmay be required before we can realize under what aspect we may hope\r\nto recognize ancient and much-denuded volcanoes. It may therefore be\r\nof advantage to consider here, in a broad way, which of the original\r\ncharacters are most permanent, and should be looked for as mementoes of\r\nancient volcanoes after long ages of denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. TYPES OF OLD VOLCANOES\r\n\r\nThe three forms of ancient volcanoes now to be discussed are--1st, the\r\nVesuvian type; 2nd, the Plateau or Fissure type; and 3rd, the Puy type.\r\n\r\n1. _The Vesuvian Type._--In this kind of volcano, lavas and fragmental\r\nejections are discharged from a central vent, which is gradually built\r\nup by successive eruptions of these materials. As the cone increases\r\nin size, parasitic cones appear on its sides, and in the energy and\r\ncompleteness of their phenomena become true volcanoes, almost rivalling\r\ntheir parent mountain. Streams of lava descend upon the lower grounds,\r\nwhile showers of dust and ashes are spread far and wide over the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\nIf a transverse section could be made of a modern Vesuvian cone, the\r\nvolcanic pile would be found to consist of alternations of lavas and\r\ntuffs, thickest at the centre, and thinning away in all directions.\r\nAt some distance from the crater, these volcanic materials might be\r\nseen to include layers of soil and remains of land-vegetation, marking\r\npauses between the eruptions, during which soil accumulated and plants\r\nsprang up upon it. Where the lavas and ashes had made their way into\r\nsheets of fresh water or into the sea, they would probably be found\r\ninterstratified with layers of ordinary sediment containing remains of\r\nthe animal or vegetable life of the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Effects of denudation on a Vesuvian cone.]\r\n\r\nConceive now the effects of prolonged denudation upon such a pile of\r\nvolcanic rocks. The cone will eventually be worn down, the crater will\r\ndisappear, and the only relics of the eruptive orifice may be the\r\ntop of the central lava-column and of any fragmental materials that\r\nsolidified within the vent (Fig. 16). The waste will, on the whole, be\r\ngreater at the cone than on the more level areas beyond. It might, in\r\ncourse of time, reach the original surface of the ground on which the\r\nvolcano built up its heap of ejected material. The central lava-plug\r\nmight thus be left as an isolated eminence rising from a platform of\r\nolder non-volcanic rocks, and the distance between it and the dwindling\r\nsheets of lava and tuff which came out of it would then be continually\r\nincreased as their outcrop receded under constant degradation.\r\n\r\nThis piece of volcanic history is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig.\r\n16. The original forms of the central volcano and of its parasitic\r\ncones are suggested by the dotted lines in the upper half of the\r\nFigure. All this upper portion has been removed by denudation, and the\r\npresent surface of the ground is shown by the uppermost continuous\r\nline. The general structure of the volcanic pile is indicated\r\nunderneath that line--the lenticular sheets of lava and tuff (_l_,\r\n_l_), the dykes (_d_, _d_), and the lavas (_p_, _p_) and agglomerates\r\n(_a_, _a_) of the central vent and of the subordinate cones.\r\n\r\nThe waste, though greatest on the higher ground of the great cone,\r\nwould not stop there. It would extend over the flatter area around\r\nthe volcano. Streams flowing over the plain would cut their way down\r\nthrough the lavas and tuffs, eroding ravines in them, and leaving\r\nthem in detached and ever diminishing outliers on the crests of the\r\nintervening ridges. We can easily picture a time when the last of\r\nthese relics would have been worn away, and when every vestige of\r\nthe volcanic ejections would have been removed, save the lava-column\r\nmarking the site of the former vent.\r\n\r\nEvery stage in this process of effacement may be recognized in actual\r\nprogress among the extinct volcanoes of the earth's surface. Probably\r\nnowhere may the phenomena be more conveniently and impressively studied\r\nthan among the volcanic districts of Central France. On the one hand,\r\nwe meet there with cinder-cones so perfect that it is hard to believe\r\nthem to have been silent ever since the beginnings of history. On the\r\nother hand, we see solitary cones of agglomerate or of lava, which have\r\nbeen left isolated, while their once overlying and encircling sheets\r\nof ejected material have been so extensively worn away as to remain\r\nmerely in scattered patches capping the neighbouring hills. Valleys\r\nmany hundreds of feet in depth have been cut by the rivers through the\r\nvolcanic sheets and the underlying Tertiary strata and granite since\r\nthe older eruptions ceased. And yet these eruptions belong to a period\r\nwhich, in a geological sense, is quite recent. It is not difficult to\r\ncontemplate a future time, geologically not very remote, when in the\r\nvalley of the Loire not a trace will remain of the wonderfully varied\r\nand interesting volcanic chronicle of that district, save the plugs\r\nthat will mark the positions of the former active vents.\r\n\r\nIn the British Islands, ancient volcanoes of the Vesuvian type are well\r\nrepresented among the Palæozoic systems of strata. Their preservation\r\nhas been largely due to the fact that they made their appearance in\r\nareas that were undergoing slow subsidence. Their piles of erupted\r\nlava and ashes were chiefly heaped up over the sea-floor, and were\r\nburied under the sand, silt and ooze that gathered there. Thus\r\ncovered up, they were protected from denudation. It is only in much\r\nlater geological ages that, owing to upheaval, gradual degradation\r\nof the surface, and removal of their overlying cover of stratified\r\nformations, they have at last been exposed to waste. The process of\r\ndisinterment may be observed in many different stages of progress. In\r\nsome localities, only the tops of the sheets of lava and tuff have\r\nbegun to show themselves; in others, everything is gone except the\r\nindestructible lava-plug.\r\n\r\nThese inequalities of denudation arise not only from variations in the\r\ndurability of volcanic rocks, but still more from the relative position\r\nof these rocks in the terrestrial crust, and the geological period at\r\nwhich, in the course of the general lowering of the surface, they have\r\nbeen laid bare. Not only are volcanic rocks of many different ages,\r\nand lie, therefore, on many successive platforms within the crust of\r\nthe earth: their places have been still further dependent upon changes\r\nin the arrangement of that crust. Fracture, upheaval, depression,\r\ncurvature, unconformable deposition of strata, have contributed to\r\nprotect some portions, while leaving others exposed to attack. Hence\r\nit happens that the volcanic record varies greatly in its fulness of\r\ndetail from one geological system or one district to another. Some\r\nchapters have been recorded with the most surprising minuteness, so\r\nthat the events which they reveal can be realized as vividly as those\r\nof a modern volcano. Others, again, are meagre and fragmentary, because\r\nthe chronicle is still for the most part buried underground, or because\r\nit has been so long exposed at the surface that only fragments of it\r\nnow remain there.\r\n\r\nIn the descriptions which will subsequently be given of ancient\r\nBritish volcanoes of the Vesuvian type, it will be shown that at many\r\nsuccessive periods during Palæozoic time, and at many distinct centres,\r\nlavas and tuffs have been piled up to a depth of frequently more\r\nthan 5000 feet--that is to say, higher than the height of Vesuvius.\r\nSometimes the vent from which these materials were ejected can be\r\nrecognized. In other places, it is still buried under later formations,\r\nor has been so denuded as to be represented now merely by the column of\r\nmolten or fragmental rock that finally solidified in it. Examples will\r\nbe quoted of such ancient vents, measuring not less than two miles in\r\ndiameter, with subsidiary \"necks\" on their flanks, like the parasitic\r\ncones on Etna.\r\n\r\nI shall show that while the ejected volcanic products have accumulated\r\nin greatest depth close to the vent that discharged them, they die\r\naway as they recede from it, sometimes so rapidly that a volcanic pile\r\nwhich is 7000 feet thick around its source may entirely thin out and\r\ndisappear in a distance of not more than ten or twelve miles. I shall\r\npoint out how, as the lavas and tuffs are followed outwards from their\r\ncentre, they not only get thinner, but are increasingly interstratified\r\namong the sedimentary deposits with which they were coeval, and that in\r\nthis way their limits, their age, and the geographical conditions under\r\nwhich they were accumulated can be satisfactorily fixed.\r\n\r\nAs illustrations of the Vesuvian type in the volcanic history of\r\nBritain, I may refer to the great Lower Silurian volcanoes of Cader\r\nIdris, Arenig, Snowdon and the Lake District, and to the Old Red\r\nSandstone volcanoes of Central Scotland.\r\n\r\n2. _The Plateau_ or _Fissure type_ is, among modern volcanoes, best\r\ndeveloped in Iceland, as will be more fully detailed in Chapter xl.\r\nIn that island, during a volcanic eruption, the ground is rent open\r\ninto long parallel fissures, only a few feet or yards in width, but\r\ntraceable sometimes for many miles, and descending to an unknown depth\r\ninto the interior. From these fissures lava issues--in some cases\r\nflowing out tranquilly in broad streams from either side, in other\r\ncases issuing with the discharge of slags and blocks of lava which are\r\npiled up into small cones set closely together along the line of the\r\nrent. It was from a fissure of this kind that the great eruption of\r\n1783 took place--the most stupendous outpouring of lava within historic\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBy successive discharges of lava from fissures, or from vents opening\r\non lines of fissure, wide plains may be covered with a floor of rock\r\nhundreds or thousands of feet in thickness, made up of horizontal beds.\r\nThe original topography, which might have been undulating and varied,\r\nis completely buried under a vast level lava-desert.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which drained the country before the beginning of the\r\nvolcanic history will have their channels filled up, and will be driven\r\nto seek new courses across the lava-fields. Again and again, as fresh\r\neruptions take place, these streams will be compelled to shift their\r\nline of flow, each river-bed being in turn sealed up in lava, with\r\nall its gravels, silts and drift-wood. But the rain will continue to\r\nfall, and the drainage to seek its way seaward. When the last eruption\r\nceases, and the rivers are at length left undisturbed at their task\r\nof erosion, they will carve that lava-floor into deep gorges or open\r\nvalleys. Where they flow between the lavas and the slopes against which\r\nthese ended, they will cut back the volcanic pile, until in course of\r\ntime the lavas will present a bold mural escarpment to the land that\r\nonce formed their limit. The volcanic plain will become a plateau,\r\nending off in this vertical wall and deeply trenched by the streams\r\nthat wind across it. And if the denudation is continued long enough,\r\nthe plateau will be reduced to detached hills, separated by deep and\r\nwide valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Section to illustrate the structure of the\r\nPlateau type.]\r\n\r\nThis geological history is illustrated by the diagram in Fig. 17.\r\nThe stippled ground underneath (_x_, _x_) represents the original\r\nundulating surface of the country on which the plateau eruptions were\r\npoured out. The lavas of these eruptions are shown by the horizontal\r\nlines to have entirely buried the heights and hollows of the old land,\r\nand to have risen up to the upper dotted line, which may be taken to\r\nmark the limit reached by the accumulation of volcanic material. The\r\ndark lines (_d_, _d_) which come up through the bedded lavas indicate\r\nthe dykes with their connected vents. Denudation has since stripped off\r\nthe upper part of the volcanic series down to the uppermost continuous\r\nblack line which represents the existing surface of the ground. The\r\nlevel sheets of lava have been deeply trenched, and in one instance the\r\nvalley has not only been cut through the volcanic pile, but has been\r\npartly eroded out of the older rocks below. To the right and left, the\r\nlavas end off abruptly in great escarpments.\r\n\r\nThe succession of events here depicted has occurred more than once in\r\nBritain. The Plateau type is chiefly developed in this country among\r\nthe great Tertiary basalt districts of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides,\r\nwhich reappear in the Faroe Islands, and again still farther north in\r\nIceland. But it also occurs among the volcanic rocks of the Old Red\r\nSandstone and Carboniferous periods.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the other volcanic types, that of the Plateaux is\r\ndistinguished by the wide extent of surface which its rocks cover, by\r\nthe great preponderance of lavas over tuffs, and by the regularity\r\nand persistence of the individual sheets of rock. In Britain, the\r\nplateau-lavas are even still often approximately horizontal, and lie\r\npiled on each other in tolerably regular beds to a thickness of 1000,\r\nand in one place to more than 3000 feet. They form wide level or\r\ngently undulating tablelands, which rise in bold escarpments from the\r\nsurrounding country and have been deeply carved into valleys. The sides\r\nof their cliffs and slopes are marked by parallel lines of terrace,\r\narising from the outcrop of successive sheets of lava (Figs. 11, 265).\r\n\r\nWith the Tertiary basalt-plateaux are connected thousands of dykes,\r\nthat follow each other along nearly parallel lines in a general\r\nnorth-westerly direction, and mark the position of fissures up which\r\nthe molten lava ascended. Occasional necks of agglomerate or basalt\r\nindicate the sites of some of the eruptive vents.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous volcanic plateaux have been more extensively denuded\r\nthan those of Tertiary age, so that a large number of their vents have\r\nbeen laid bare. In general these vents are of comparatively small size,\r\nthough larger than those of the Carboniferous Puys. In some districts,\r\nabundant dykes traverse the rocks on which the plateaux rest, though\r\nthe fissures seem to have been less numerous than in Tertiary time.\r\n\r\n3. _The Puy type_, as before remarked, takes its name from the\r\nwell-known _puys_, or volcanic cones, of Central France. Volcanoes\r\nof this type form conical hills, generally of small size, consisting\r\nusually of fragmental materials, sometimes of lava. Where a cone is\r\npartially effaced by a second, and even by a third, successive slight\r\nshiftings of the vent are to be inferred (see Figs. 29 and 214). In\r\nmany cases, no lava has issued from such cones, nor were the ashes\r\nand cinders dispersed far from the vent. Hence, in the progress of\r\ndenudation, cones of this kind are easily effaced.\r\n\r\nFrom the uniformity of composition of their materials, the simplicity\r\nand regularity of their forms, and their small size, it may be inferred\r\nthat many of these cones were the products of single eruptions. They\r\nmay conceivably have been thrown up in a few days, or even in a single\r\nday. The history of Monte Nuovo, in the Bay of Naples, which was formed\r\nwithin twenty-four hours in the year 1538, is a memorable example of\r\nthe rapidity with which a cone more than 400 feet high may be thrown up\r\nat some distance from a central vent.\r\n\r\nThe smallest independent volcanoes are included in the Puy type. In\r\nmany instances the diameter of the funnel has not exceeded a few yards;\r\nthe largest examples of the type seldom exceed 1000 feet in width.\r\n\r\nWhere lavas have been discharged, as well as ashes and stones, a more\r\nvigorous activity is indicated than where merely cones of tuff were\r\nformed. The lavas may come from more than one side of a cone, and\r\nmay flow in opposite directions for a distance of several miles. It\r\nis observable that considerable streams of lava have issued from the\r\nbase of a cinder-cone without disturbing it. The molten rock has found\r\na passage between the loose materials and the surface on which they\r\nrest,[20] though, in some cases, the cone may have been thrown up after\r\nthe emission of the lava.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: M. Boule, _Bull. Carte Géol. France_, No. 28, tome iv. p.\r\n232.]\r\n\r\nIn the history of a puy there is commonly a first discharge of\r\nfragmentary material; then lava may flow out, followed by a final\r\ndischarge of loose stones and ashes. Hence the products of such a vent\r\ngroup themselves into three layers--two of breccia separated by an\r\nintervening sheet of lava.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: M. Boule, _Bull. Carte Géol. France_, No. 28, tome iv.]\r\n\r\nGreat changes are wrought on puys and their connected lavas and tuffs\r\nduring the progress of denudation. The cones are eventually destroyed,\r\nand only a stump of agglomerate or lava is left to mark its place.\r\nThe connection of a lava-stream with its parent vent may likewise be\r\neffaced, and the lava itself may be reduced to merely a few separate\r\npatches, perhaps capping a ridge, while the surrounding ground has\r\nbeen hollowed into valleys. If the waste continues long enough, even\r\nthese outliers will disappear, and nothing but the neck or stump of the\r\nlittle volcano will remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Diagram illustrating the structure and\r\ndenudation of Puys.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 18) may help to make these changes more\r\nintelligible. The upper dotted lines show the original forms of three\r\npuys with the covering of loose materials discharged by them over the\r\nsurrounding ground. The lower shaded portion represents the surface\r\nas left by denudation, and a section of the three vents beneath that\r\nsurface. The whole of the cones and craters has here been swept away,\r\nand only the volcanic \"neck\" is in each case left. In the vent to the\r\nright, the material that fills it up is a coarse agglomerate, which\r\nprojects as a rounded dome above the surrounding country. The central\r\npipe is filled with fragmentary materials, through which molten rock\r\nhas risen, giving off dykes and veins. In the vent to the left hand,\r\nonly lava is seen to occupy the orifice, representing the column of\r\nmolten rock which solidified there and brought the activity of this\r\nlittle volcano to an end. It will be observed that in each of these\r\nvolcanic hills the present outlines are very far from being those\r\nof the original volcano, and that the eminence projects because of\r\nits greater resistance to the forces of denudation that have not\r\nonly removed the superficial volcanic material, but have made some\r\nprogress in lowering the level of the ground on which that material was\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nThe typical area for the study of Puys is the extraordinarily\r\ninteresting volcanic region of Central France. There the volcanic\r\ncones are clustered in irregular groups, sometimes so close as to be\r\ntouching each other; elsewhere separated by intervals of several miles.\r\nThey may be traced in all stages of decay, from the most perfect cones\r\nand craters to the isolated eminence that marks the site of a once\r\nactive chimney. Their lavas, too, may be seen as detached fragments of\r\nplateaux, many hundred feet above the valleys that have been excavated\r\nsince they flowed.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See Desmarest's classic map and his papers in _Mem. Acad.\r\nRoy. Sciences_, Paris, 1774, 1779; _Journ. de Physique_, 1779; Scrope's\r\n_Geology of Central France_, 1827, and _Extinct Volcanoes of Central\r\nFrance_, 1858; Lecoq's _Époques Géologiques de l'Auvergne_, 1867; M.\r\nMichel Lévy, _Bull. Soc. Géol. France_, 1890, p. 688; M. Boule, _Bull.\r\nCarte Géol. France_, No. 28, tome iv. 1892.]\r\n\r\nAnother well-known region of modern Puys is that of the Eifel, where\r\nthe cones and craters are often so fresh that it is difficult to\r\nbelieve them to be prehistoric.[23] One of the most remarkable denuded\r\npuy-regions in Europe covers a wide territory in the Swabian Alps\r\nof Würtemberg. No fewer than 125 denuded necks filled with tuff,\r\nagglomerate and basalt have there been mapped and described. They\r\nare of higher antiquity than the Upper Miocene strata, and have thus\r\nprobably been exposed to prolonged denudation. In external aspect\r\nand internal structure they present the closest parallel to the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian \"necks\" of Britain described in Books VI. and\r\nVII. of the present work.[24]\r\n\r\nAmong the Palæozoic volcanoes of Britain many admirable illustrations\r\nof the Puy type are to be found. Their cones are almost always entirely\r\ngone, though traces of them occasionally appear. The \"necks\" that show\r\nthe position of the vents are in some districts crowded together as\r\nthickly as those of Auvergne. During the Carboniferous and Permian\r\nperiods in Central Scotland, clusters of such little volcanoes must\r\nhave risen among shallow lagoons and inland sheets of water, casting\r\nout their ashes and pouring forth their little streams of lava over the\r\nwater-bottom around them and then dying out. As these eruptions took\r\nplace in a region that was gradually subsiding, the cones and their\r\nejected ashes and lavas were one by one submerged, the looser materials\r\nbeing washed down and spread out among the silt, sand or mud, and\r\nenveloping the remains of any plants or animals that might be strewn\r\nover the floor of the lake or sea. Hence the Puys of Palæozoic time in\r\nBritain have been preserved with extraordinary fulness of detail. They\r\nhave been dissected by denudation, both among the hills of the interior\r\nand along the margin of the sea. Their structure can thus be in some\r\nrespects made out even more satisfactorily than that of the much\r\nyounger and more perfect cones of Central France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The Eifel district has been fully described by Hibbert,\r\nVon Dechen, and other writers. Von Dechen's little handbooks to the\r\nEifel and Siebengebirge are useful guides.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: These Würtemberg vents have been elaborately described\r\nand discussed by Professor W. Branco of Tübingen in his _Schwabens 125\r\nVulkan-Embryonen und deren tufferfülte Ausbruchsröhren, das grösste\r\nGebiet chemaliger Maare auf der Erde_, Stuttgart, 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\niv. DETERMINATION OF THE RELATIVE GEOLOGICAL DATES OF ANCIENT VOLCANOES\r\n\r\nIn themselves, accumulations of volcanic materials do not furnish any\r\nexact or reliable evidence of the geological period in which they\r\nwere erupted. The lavas of the early Palæozoic ages may, indeed, on\r\ncareful examination, be distinguished from those of Tertiary date, but,\r\nas we have seen, the difference is rather due to the effects of age\r\nand gradual alteration than to any inherent fundamental distinction\r\nbetween them. In all essential particulars of composition and internal\r\nstructure, the lavas of the Cambrian or Silurian period resemble\r\nthose of Tertiary and modern volcanoes. The igneous magmas which\r\nsupply volcanic vents thus appear to have been very much what they are\r\nnow from early geological epochs. At least no important difference,\r\naccording to relative age, has yet been satisfactorily established\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nBut although the rocks themselves afford no precise or trustworthy clue\r\nto their date, yet where they have been intercalated contemporaneously\r\namong fossiliferous stratified formations, of which the geological\r\nhorizon can be determined from included organic remains, it is easy\r\nto assign them to their exact place in geological chronology. A\r\ndetermination of this kind is only an application of the general\r\nprinciple on which the sequence of the geological record is defined. A\r\nfew illustrations will suffice to make this point quite obvious.\r\n\r\nAmong the volcanic tuffs in the upper part of Snowdon various fossils\r\noccur, which are identical with those found in the well-known Bala\r\nLimestone. As the accepted reading of such evidence, we conclude\r\nthat these tuffs must therefore be of the same geological age as\r\nthat limestone. Now the position of this seam of rock has been well\r\nestablished as a definite horizon in the series of Lower Silurian\r\nformations. And we consequently without hesitation place the eruptions\r\nof the Snowdon volcano on that same platform, and speak of them as\r\nbelonging to the Bala division of the Lower Silurian period.\r\n\r\nAgain, in West Lothian the tuffs and lavas ejected from many scattered\r\npuys were interstratified among shales and limestones in which the\r\ncharacteristic fossils of the Carboniferous Limestone are abundant.\r\nThere cannot, therefore, be any doubt that these eruptions were much\r\nyounger than those of Snowdon, and that they took place at the time\r\nwhen the Carboniferous Limestone was being deposited. We thus speak of\r\nthem as belonging to volcanoes which were active in that early part\r\nof the Carboniferous period to which the thick Mountain Limestone of\r\nIreland and Derbyshire belongs.\r\n\r\nAs yet another illustration of the determination of geological age,\r\nan example from the plateau-type of eruption may be given. The great\r\nbasalt-plateaux of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides are built up of lavas\r\nthat lie unconformably on the Chalk. They are thus proved to be later\r\nthan the Cretaceous system, and this deduction would hold true even if\r\nno organic remains were found associated with the volcanic rocks. But\r\nhere and there, intercalated between the basalts, lie layers of shale,\r\nlimestone and tuff containing well-preserved remains of plants which\r\nare recognizable as older Tertiary forms of vegetation. This fossil\r\nevidence definitely places the date of the eruptions in older Tertiary\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, proceeding on this basis of reasoning, we may arrange\r\nthe successive volcanic eruptions of any given district, make out their\r\norder of sequence in time, and thus obtain materials for a consecutive\r\nhistory of them. Or, proceeding from that district into other regions,\r\nwe may compare its volcanic phenomena with theirs, determine the\r\nrelative dates of their respective eruptions, and in this way compile\r\na wider history of volcanic action in past time. It is on these\r\nprinciples that the general and detailed chronology of the volcanic\r\nrocks of the British Isles has been worked out, and that the following\r\nchapters have been arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. HOW THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY ASSOCIATED WITH ANCIENT VOLCANOES IS\r\nASCERTAINED\r\n\r\nWhile the materials erupted from old volcanic vents tell plainly enough\r\ntheir subterranean origin, they may leave us quite in the dark as to\r\nthe conditions under which they were thrown out at the surface. Yet a\r\ncareful examination of the strata associated with them may throw much\r\nlight on the circumstances in which the eruptions took place. Many of\r\nthe results of such examination will be given in subsequent chapters. I\r\nwill here submit illustrations of how four different phases of physical\r\ngeography during former volcanic eruptions may be satisfactorily\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 19.--Section illustrating submarine eruptions; alternations\r\n     of lavas and tuffs with limestones and shales full of marine\r\n     organisms.\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. _Submarine Eruptions._--As by far the largest accessible part of the\r\ncrust of the earth consists of old marine sediments, it is natural that\r\nthe volcanic records preserved in that crust should be mainly those of\r\nsubmarine eruptions. That many lavas during the geological past were\r\npoured out upon the sea-bottom is plainly shown by the thick beds of\r\nmarine organisms which they have overspread and which lie above them\r\n(Fig. 19). In Central Scotland, for example, sheets of basalt have\r\nflowed over a sea-bottom on which thick groves of crinoids, bunches\r\nof coral and crowds of sea-shells were living. Not less striking is\r\nthe evidence supplied by bands of tuff. Around Limerick, for instance,\r\nthe thick Carboniferous Limestone is interrupted by many thin layers\r\nof tuff marking intervals when showers of volcanic dust fell over\r\nthe sea-bottom, killing off the organisms that lived there. But the\r\nlimestone that overlies these volcanic intercalations is again crowded\r\nwith fossils, proving that the crinoids, corals and shells once more\r\nspread over the place and flourished as abundantly as ever above the\r\ntuff.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 19) illustrates these statements. At\r\nthe bottom a thick mass of limestone (_l_) full of crinoids, corals,\r\nbrachiopods and other marine organisms bears witness to a long time of\r\nrepose, when the clear sea-water teemed with life. At last a volcanic\r\nexplosion took place, which threw out the first seam of tuff (_t_).\r\nBut this was only a transient interruption, for the accumulation of\r\ncalcareous sediment was immediately resumed, and the next band of\r\nlimestone was laid down. Thereafter a more prolonged or vigorous\r\neruption ejected a larger mass of dust and stones, which fell over the\r\nbottom and prevented the continuation of the limestone. But that the\r\nsea still abounded in life is shown by the numerous organisms imbedded\r\nin the second stratified band of tuff. At last an access of volcanic\r\nvigour gave vent to a stream of slaggy lava, which rolled over the\r\nsea-bottom and solidified in the thick sheet of amydaloidal basalt\r\nmarked B. This outflow was followed by a further discharge of ashes and\r\nstones, which, from their absence of stratification, may be supposed to\r\nhave been the result of a single explosion, or at least to have fallen\r\ntoo rapidly for the marine currents to rearrange them in layers. When\r\nthe water cleared, the abundant sea-creatures returned, and from their\r\ncrowded remains limestone once more gathered over the bottom. Yet the\r\nvolcanic history had not then reached its close, for again there came a\r\ndischarge of ashes, followed by the outpouring of a second lava, which\r\nconsolidated as a sheet of columnar basalt (B').\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, in order to prove the eruptions to have been\r\nsubmarine, that organic remains should be found in the tuffs or between\r\nthem. If the volcanic ejections are intercalated among strata which\r\nelsewhere can be proved to be marine, their discharge must obviously\r\nhave taken place under the sea. The vent that discharged them may have\r\nraised its head above the sea-level, but its lavas and tuffs were\r\nspread out over the adjoining sea-floor.\r\n\r\n2. _Lacustrine Eruptions._--The same line of evidence furnishes\r\nproof that some volcanoes arose in inland sheets of water. If their\r\nproducts are interstratified among sandstones, gravels and shell-marls,\r\nwherein the remains of land-plants, insects and lacustrine shells, are\r\npreserved, we may be confident that the eruptions took place in or\r\nnear to some lake-basin. The older lavas and tuffs of Central France\r\nsupply an instructive example of such an association. In Britain, the\r\nabundant and extensive outpouring of lavas and tuffs during the time\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone probably occurred in large lakes. Among\r\nthe sediments of these bodies of water, interstratified between the\r\nvolcanic sheets, remains of land-plants are abundant, together with,\r\nhere and there, those of myriapods washed down from the woodlands, and\r\nof many forms of ganoid fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Diagram illustrating volcanic eruptions on a\r\nriver-plain.]\r\n\r\n3. _Fluviatile Eruptions._--Volcanoes have sometimes arisen on\r\nriver-plains or on the edges of valleys and gorges, and have poured out\r\ntheir lavas and discharged their ashes over the channels or alluvial\r\nlands of the streams. Volcanic materials, usurping the water-channels,\r\nbury or are interstratified with fluviatile sand or shingle, containing\r\nperhaps remains of the vegetation or animal life of the surrounding\r\nland. There may thus be a constant shifting of the river-courses,\r\nand a consequent deposit of fluviatile sediment at many successive\r\nlevels among the lavas and tuffs. In Fig. 20 some of these changes\r\nare indicated in a series of bedded lavas (_l_). The lower part of the\r\ndiagram shows the dying out of a bed of river gravel (_g_) against the\r\nsloping end of a lava-stream, and the sealing up of this intercalation\r\nby a fresh outpouring of lava. Higher up in the diagram a section is\r\nshown of a gully or ravine which has been cut out of the lavas by a\r\nstream, and has become choked up with water-worn detritus. Subsequent\r\noutflows of lava have rolled over this channel and sealed it up.\r\nExamples of such intercalations of lava with old river deposits, and\r\nof the burying of water-courses, will be cited in the account of the\r\nTertiary volcanic plateaux of Britain in Chapter xxxviii.\r\n\r\n4. _Terrestrial Eruptions._--That volcanoes in former times broke\r\nout on land as well as in water may readily be expected. But it is\r\nobvious that the proofs of a terrestrial origin may not be always\r\neasy to obtain, for every land-surface is exposed to denudation; and\r\nthus the relics of the eruptions of one age may be effaced by the\r\nwinds, rains, frosts and rivers of the next. In assigning any volcanic\r\ngroup to a terrestrial origin, we may be guided partly by negative\r\nevidence, such as the absence of all trace of marine organisms in\r\nany of the sedimentary layers associated with the group. But such\r\nevidence standing by itself would not be satisfactory or sufficient.\r\nIf, however, between the sheets of lava there occur occasional\r\ndepressions, filled with hardened sediment full of land-plants, with\r\npossibly traces of insects and other terrestrial organisms, we may with\r\nsome confidence infer that these silted-up hollows represent pools or\r\nlakes that gathered on the surface of the lava-sheets, and into which\r\nthe vegetation of the surrounding ground was blown or washed. Rain\r\nfalling on the rugged surface of a lava-field would naturally gather\r\ninto pools and lakes, as the bottoms of the hollows became \"puddled\"\r\nby the gradual decay of the rock and the washing of fine silt into the\r\ncrevices of the lava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Diagram illustrating volcanic eruptions on a\r\nland-surface.]\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be expected that prolonged exposure to the air would give\r\nrise to disintegration of the lava and to the consequent formation of\r\nsoil. Terrestrial vegetation would naturally spring up on such soil;\r\ntrees might take root upon it. Hence, if another lava-flood deluged the\r\nsurface, the soil and its vegetable mantle would be entombed under the\r\nmolten rock.\r\n\r\nThese geological changes are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 21.\r\nTwo hollows among the lavas are there shown to have been filled with\r\nsilt, including successive layers of vegetation now converted into\r\ncoal. One of the soils (_s_) is marked between the lavas, and the\r\ncharred stump of a tree with its roots still in another layer of soil\r\nhigher up is seen to have been engulphed in the overlying sheet of\r\nmelted rock.\r\n\r\nAdmirable illustrations of this succession of events are to be\r\nencountered among the great Tertiary basaltic plateaux which cover so\r\nlarge an area in the north-west of Europe. Not only has no trace of\r\nany marine organism been found among their interstratified sedimentary\r\nlayers, but they have yielded a terrestrial flora which is preserved\r\nin hollows between the successive sheets of basalt. A full account of\r\nthese rocks will be given in Book VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  Underground Phases of Volcanic Action. B.

By the study of volcanoes and their products we learn\r\nthat the fused substances are not everywhere precisely the same and\r\ndo not remain absolutely uniform, even in the same volcanic region.\r\nBut in what manner and from what causes these variations arise is\r\nstill unknown. We are further aware that the molten magma, under a\r\ncentre of volcanic disturbance, manifests from time to time energetic\r\nmovements which culminate in eruptions at the surface. But what may\r\nbe the exciting cause of these movements, to what depth they descend,\r\nand over what extent of superficies they spread, are matters regarding\r\nwhich nothing better than conjecture can as yet be offered. It is true\r\nthat, in some cases, a magma of fairly uniform composition has been\r\nerupted over a vast tract of the earth's surface, and must have had\r\na correspondingly wide extent within the terrestrial crust. Thus in\r\nthe case of the older Tertiary volcanic eruptions of North-Western\r\nEurope, basalt of practically the same composition was discharged\r\nfrom thousands of fissures and vents distributed from the south of\r\nAntrim northward beyond the Inner Hebrides, through the chain of the\r\nFaroe Islands and over the whole breadth of Iceland. Under the British\r\nIsles alone, the subterranean reservoirs of molten lavas must have\r\nbeen at least 40,000 square miles in united area. If they stretched\r\ncontinuously northwards below the Faroe Islands and Iceland, as is\r\nhighly probable, that is, for 600 miles further, their total extent may\r\nhave been comparable to such a region as Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nWas this vast underground body of lava part of a universal liquid mass\r\nwithin the globe, or was it rather of the nature of one or more lakes\r\nor large vesicles within the crust? We can only offer speculation for\r\nanswer. On the other hand, there seems to be good proof that in some\r\ndistricts, both now and in former geological periods, such differences\r\nexist between the materials ejected from vents not far distant from\r\neach other as to show the existence of more limited distinct reservoirs\r\nof liquid rock underneath.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions here asked will be further dealt with in later\r\npages in connection with such geological evidence as can be produced\r\nregarding them. But it will be found that at every step in the\r\nendeavour to ascertain the origin of volcanic phenomena difficulties\r\npresent themselves which are now and may long remain insoluble.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Vents of Eruption\r\n\r\nIt is a general belief that the first stage in the formation of a\r\nvolcano of the Vesuvian type by the efforts of subterranean energy\r\nis the rending of the terrestrial crust in a line of fissure. Some\r\nof the most remarkable groups of active volcanoes on the face of the\r\nglobe are certainly placed in rows, as if they had risen along some\r\nsuch great rents. The actual fissure, however, is not there seen, and\r\nits existence is only a matter of probable inference. Undoubtedly the\r\neffect of successive eruptions must be to conceal the fissure, even if\r\nit ever revealed itself at the surface.\r\n\r\nWhat is supposed to have marked the initial step in the formation of a\r\ngreat volcano is occasionally repeated in the subsequent history of the\r\nmountain. During the convulsive shocks that precede and accompany an\r\neruption, the sides of the cone, and even sometimes part of the ground\r\nbeyond, are rent open, occasionally for a distance of several miles,\r\nand on the fissures thus formed minor volcanoes are built up.\r\n\r\nIt is in Iceland, as already stated, that the phenomena of fissures\r\nare best displayed. There the great deserts of lava are from time to\r\ntime dislocated by new lines of rent, which ascend up to the surface\r\nand stretch for horizontal distances of many miles. From these long\r\nnarrow chasms lava flows out to either side; while cones of slag and\r\nscoriæ usually form upon them. This interesting eruptive phase will be\r\nmore fully described in the chapters dealing with the Tertiary volcanic\r\nrocks of Britain.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that in a vast number of volcanic\r\nvents of all geological periods no trace can be discovered of their\r\nconnection with any fissure in the earth's crust. Such fissures may\r\nindeed exist underneath, and may have served as passages for the\r\nascent of lava to within a greater or less distance from the surface.\r\nBut it is certain that volcanic energy has the power of blowing out\r\nan opening for itself through the upper part of the crust without the\r\nexistence of any visible fissure there. What may be the limits of depth\r\nat which this mode of communication with the outer air is possible we\r\ndo not yet know. They must obviously vary greatly according to the\r\nstructure of the terrestrial crust on the one hand, and the amount\r\nand persistence of volcanic energy on the other. We may suppose that\r\nwhere a fissure terminates upward under a great depth of overlying\r\nrock, the internal magma may rise up to the end of the rent, and even\r\nbe injected laterally into the surrounding parts of the crust, but\r\nmay be unable to complete the formation of a volcano by opening a\r\npassage to the surface. But where the thickness of rock above the end\r\nof the fissure is not too great, the expansive energy of the vapours\r\nabsorbed in the magma may overcome the resistance of that cover, and\r\nblow out an orifice by which the volcanic materials can reach the\r\nsurface. In the formation of new cones within the historic period at a\r\ndistance from any central volcano, the existence of an open fissure at\r\nthe surface has not been generally observed. When, for example, Monte\r\nNuovo was formed, it rose close to the shore among fields and gardens,\r\nbut without the appearance of any rent from which its materials were\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThat in innumerable instances during the geological past, similar vents\r\nhave been opened without the aid of fissures that reached the surface,\r\nwill be made clear from the evidence to be drawn from the volcanic\r\nhistory of the British Isles. So abundant, indeed, are these instances\r\nthat they may be taken as proving that, at least in the Puy type of\r\nvolcanoes, the actual vents have generally been blown out by explosions\r\nrather than by the ascent of fissures to the open air.\r\n\r\nIn cases where, as in Iceland, fissures open at the surface and\r\ndischarge lava there, the channel of ascent is the open space\r\nbetween the severed walls of the rent. Within this space the lava\r\nwill eventually cool and solidify as a _dyke_. It is obvious that a\r\ncomparatively small amount of denudation will suffice to remove all\r\ntrace of the connection of such a dyke with the stream of lava that\r\nissued from it. Among the thousands of dykes belonging to the Tertiary\r\nperiod in the British Islands, it is probable that many may have\r\nserved as lines of escape for the basalt at the surface. But it is now\r\napparently impossible to distinguish between those which had such a\r\ncommunication with the outer air and those that ended upward within\r\nthe crust of the earth. The structure of dykes will be subsequently\r\ndiscussed among the subterranean intrusions of volcanic material.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary volcanic orifice the ground-plan is usually irregularly\r\ncircular or elliptical. If that portion of the crust of the earth\r\nthrough which the vent is drilled should be of uniform structure, and\r\nwould thus yield equally to the effects of the volcanic energy, we\r\nmight anticipate that the ascent and explosion of successive globular\r\nmasses of highly heated vapours would give rise to a cylindrical\r\npipe. But in truth the rocks of the terrestrial crust vary greatly in\r\nstructure; while the direction and force of volcanic explosions are\r\nliable to change. Hence considerable irregularities of ground-plan are\r\nto be looked for among vents.\r\n\r\nSome of these irregularities are depicted in Fig. 22, which represents\r\nthe ground plan of some vents from the Carboniferous volcanic districts\r\nof Scotland. They are all drawn on the same scale. Other examples will\r\nbe cited in later chapters from the same and other parts of the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nSome of the most marked departures from the normal and simple type of\r\nvent occur where two orifices have been opened close to each other,\r\nor where the same vent has shifted its position (Figs. 29, 125, 205,\r\nand 214). Curiously irregular or elongated forms may thus arise in the\r\nresultant \"necks\" now visible at the surface. Many striking examples\r\nof these features may be seen among the Carboniferous and Permian\r\nvolcanoes to be afterwards described. Occasionally where an open\r\nfissure has served as a vent it has given rise to a long dyke-like mass\r\n(No. 1 in Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Ground-plans of some Volcanic vents from the\r\nCarboniferous districts of Scotland.\r\n\r\n  1. Linhope Burn, near Mosspaul, Roxburghshire; the shaded parts\r\n     are intrusions of trachytic material. 2. Hazelside Hill, two\r\n     miles W. from Newcastleton, Roxburghshire. 3.

Hartsgarth Flow, Liddesdale.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe size of a volcanic vent may vary indefinitely from a diameter of\r\nnot more than a yard or two up to one or two or more miles. As a rule,\r\nthe smaller the vents the more numerously are they crowded together. In\r\nthe case of large central volcanoes like Etna, where many subsidiary\r\nvents, some of them forming not inconsiderable hills, may spring up\r\nalong the sides of the parent cone, denudation will ultimately remove\r\nall the material that was heaped up on the surface, and leave the\r\nstumps or necks of the parasitic vents in groups around the central\r\nfunnel.\r\n\r\nEach volcanic chimney, by which vapours, ashes or lava are discharged\r\nat the surface, may be conceived to descend in a more or less nearly\r\nvertical direction until it reaches the surface of the lava whence the\r\neruptions proceed. After the cessation of volcanic activity, this pipe\r\nwill be left filled up with the last material discharged, which will\r\nusually take the form of a rudely cylindrical column reaching from the\r\nbottom of the crater down to the lava-reservoir. It will be obvious\r\nthat no matter how great may be the denudation of the volcano, or how\r\nextensive may be the removal of the various materials discharged over\r\nthe surrounding ground, the pipe or funnel with its column of solid\r\nrock must still remain. No amount of waste of the surface of the land\r\ncan efface that column. Successively lower and yet lower levels may be\r\nlaid bare in it, but the column itself goes still further down. It will\r\ncontinue to make its appearance at the surface until its roots are laid\r\nbare in the lava of the subterranean magma. Hence, of all the relics of\r\nvolcanic action, the filled-up chimney of the eruptive vent is the most\r\nenduring. Save where it may have been of the less deep-seated nature\r\nof a \"hornito\" upon a lava-stream, we may regard it as practically\r\npermanent. The full meaning of these statements will be best understood\r\nfrom a consideration of the numerous illustrations to be afterwards\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe stumps of volcanic columns of this nature, after prolonged\r\ndenudation, generally project above the surrounding ground as rounded\r\nor conical eminences known as \"Necks\" (Fig. 23. See also Figs. 52,\r\n82, 102, 109, 123, 133, 144, 178, 192, 195, 203, 204, 209, 294, 298,\r\n306 and 310). Their outlines, however, vary with the nature of their\r\ncomponent materials. The softer rocks, such as tuffs and agglomerates,\r\nare apt to assume the form of smooth domes or cones, while the harder\r\nand especially the crystalline rocks rise into irregular, craggy\r\nhills. Occasionally, indeed, it may happen that a neck makes no\r\nprominence on the surface of the ground, and its existence may only\r\nbe discoverable by a careful examination of the geological structure\r\nof the locality. Now and then an old vent will be found not to form a\r\nhill, but to sink into a hollow. Such variations, however, have little\r\nor no reference to original volcanic contours in the history of the\r\nlocalities which display them. They arise mainly from the differing\r\nhardness and structure of the materials that have filled the vents, and\r\nthe consequent diversity in the amount of resistance which they have\r\noffered to the progress of denudation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--View of an old volcanic \"Neck\" (The Knock,\r\nLargs, Ayrshire, a vent of Lower Carboniferous age).]\r\n\r\nThe materials now found in volcanic funnels are of two kinds: 1st,\r\nFragmentary, derived from volcanic explosions; and 2nd, Lava-form,\r\narising from the ascent and consolidation of molten rock within the\r\nfunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Necks of Fragmentary Materials_\r\n\r\nBy far the most satisfactory evidence of a former volcanic orifice\r\nis furnished by a neck of fragmentary materials. Where \"bosses\" of\r\ncrystalline rock rise to the surface and assume the outward form of\r\nnecks, we cannot always be certain that they may not have been produced\r\nby subterranean intrusions that never effected any connection with the\r\nsurface. In other words, such bosses may not mark volcanic orifices\r\nat all, though they may have been part of the underground protrusions\r\nof volcanoes in their neighbourhood. But where the chimney has been\r\nfilled with debris, there can be no doubt that it truly marks the site\r\nof a once active volcano. The fragmentary material is an eloquent\r\nmemorial of the volcanic explosions that drilled the vent, kept it\r\nopen, and finally filled it up. These explosions could not have taken\r\nplace unless the elastic vapours which caused them had found an escape\r\nfrom the pressure under which they lay within the crust of the earth.\r\nNow and then, indeed, where the outpouring of lava or some other cause\r\nhas left cavernous spaces within the crust, there may conceivably\r\nbe some feeble explosion there, and some trifling accumulation of\r\nfragmentary materials. But we may regard it as practically certain that\r\nthe mass of tumultuous detritus now found in volcanic necks could not\r\nhave been formed unless where a free passage had been opened from the\r\nmolten magma underneath to the outer surface of the planet.\r\n\r\nConsiderable diversity may be observed in the nature and arrangement of\r\nthe fragmentary materials in volcanic necks. The chief varieties may\r\nbe arranged in four groups: (1) Necks of non-volcanic detritus; (2)\r\nNecks of volcanic agglomerate or tuff; (3) Necks of agglomerate or tuff\r\nwith a central plug of lava; and (4) Necks of agglomerate or tuff with\r\nveins, dykes or some lateral irregular mass of lava.\r\n\r\n(1) _Necks of non-volcanic Detritus._--During the first convulsive\r\nefforts of a volcanic focus to find a vent at the surface, the\r\nexplosions that eventually form the orifice do so by blowing out in\r\nfragments the solid rocks of the exterior of the terrestrial crust. Of\r\nthe detritus thus produced, shot up the funnel and discharged into the\r\nair, part may gather round the mouth of the opening and build up there\r\na cone with an enclosed crater, while part will fall back into the\r\nchimney, either to accumulate there, should the explosions cease, or\r\nto be thrown out again, should they continue. In the feeblest or most\r\ntransient kinds of volcanic energy, the explosive vapours may escape\r\nwithout any accompanying ascent of the molten magma to the surface,\r\nand even without any sensible discharge of volcanic \"ashes\" from that\r\nmagma. In such cases, as I have already pointed out, the detritus of\r\nthe non-volcanic rocks, whatever they may be, through which volcanic\r\nenergy has made an opening, accumulate in the pipe and eventually\r\nconsolidate there. Examples of this nature will be adduced in later\r\nchapters from the volcanic districts of Britain.\r\n\r\nWhere only non-volcanic materials fill up a vent we may reasonably\r\ninfer that the eruptions were comparatively feeble, never advancing\r\nbeyond the initial stage when elastic vapours made their escape with\r\nexplosive violence, but did not lead to the outflow of lava or the\r\ndischarge of ashes. In the great majority of necks, however, traces of\r\nthe earliest eruptions have been destroyed by subsequent explosions,\r\nand the uprise of thoroughly volcanic fragments. Yet even among these\r\nfragments, occasional blocks may be detected which have been detached\r\nfrom the rocks forming the walls of the funnel.\r\n\r\nThe general name of Agglomerate, as already stated, is given to all\r\naccumulations of coarse, usually unstratified, detritus in volcanic\r\nfunnels, irrespective of the lithological nature of the materials.\r\nFor further and more precise designation, when an agglomerate is\r\nmainly made up of fragments of one particular rock, the name of that\r\nrock may be prefixed as sandstone-agglomerate, granite-agglomerate,\r\nbasalt-agglomerate, trachyte-agglomerate. Volcanic agglomerate is a\r\nuseful general term that may include all the coarser detritus ejected\r\nby volcanic action.\r\n\r\nWhere volcanic explosions have been of sufficient violence or long\r\ncontinuance, the upper part of the funnel may be left empty, and on the\r\ncessation of volcanic activity, may be filled with water and become a\r\nlake. The ejected detritus left round the edge of the orifice sometimes\r\nhardly forms any wall, the crater-bottom being but little below the\r\nlevel of the surrounding ground. Explosion-lakes are not infrequent in\r\nCentral France and the Eifel (Maare). A more gigantic illustration is\r\nafforded by the perfectly circular crater of Coon Butte in Arizona,\r\nabout 4000 feet in diameter and 600 feet deep. It has been blown out in\r\nlimestone, the debris of which forms a rampart 200 feet high around it.\r\nExamples will afterwards be cited from the Tertiary volcanic plateaux\r\nof North-Western Europe. Vents may also be formed by an engulphment\r\nor subsidence of the material, like that which has taken place at the\r\ngreat lava cauldron of Hawaii, still an active volcano. The picturesque\r\nCrater Lake of Oregon is an admirable instance of this structure.\r\n\r\n(2) _Necks of Agglomerate or Tuff._--In the vast majority of cases, the\r\nexplosions that clear out a funnel through the rocks of the upper part\r\nof the crust do not end by merely blowing out these rocks in fragments.\r\nThe elastic vapours that escape from the molten lava underneath are\r\nusually followed by an uprise of the lava within the pipe. Relieved\r\nfrom the enormous pressure under which it had before lain, the lava as\r\nit ascends is kept in ebullition, or may be torn into bombs which are\r\nsent whirling up into the air, or may even be blown into the finest\r\ndust by the sudden expansion of the imprisoned steam. If its ascent is\r\narrested within the vent, and a crust is formed on the upper surface of\r\nthe lava-column, this congealed crust may be disrupted and thrown out\r\nin scattered pieces by successive explosions, but may re-form again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Section of neck of agglomerate, rising through\r\nsandstones and shales.]\r\n\r\nIn many vents, both in recent and in ancient times, volcanic progress\r\nhas never advanced beyond this early stage of the ejection of stones\r\nand dust. The column of lava, though rising near enough to the surface\r\nto supply by its ebullition abundant pyroclastic detritus, coarse and\r\nfine, has not flowed out above ground, nor even ascended to the top\r\nof the funnel. It may have formed, at the surface, cones of stones\r\nand cinders with enclosed craters. But thereafter the eruptions have\r\nceased. The vents, filled up with the fragmentary ejected material,\r\nhave given passage only to hot vapours and gases. As these gradually\r\nceased, the volcanoes have become finally extinct. Denudation has\r\nattacked their sides and crests. If submerged in the sea or a lake,\r\nthe cones have been washed down, and their materials have been strewn\r\nover the bottom of the water. If standing on the land, they have been\r\ngradually levelled, until perhaps only the projecting knob or neck of\r\nsolidified rubbish in each funnel has remained to mark its site. The\r\nburied column of compacted fragmentary material will survive as the\r\nonly memorial of the eruptions (Fig. 24. For views of necks formed of\r\nagglomerate or tuff see Figs. 23, 82, 102, 123, 144, 178, 192, 203,\r\n204, 209, 210, 212, 216).\r\n\r\nThe volcanic agglomerates of such vents sometimes include, among their\r\nnon-volcanic materials, pieces of rock which bear evidence of having\r\nbeen subjected to considerable heat (see vol. ii. p. 78). Carbonaceous\r\nshales, for instance, have had their volatile constituents driven off,\r\nlimestones have been converted into marble, and a general induration\r\nor \"baking\" may be perceptible. In other cases, however, the fragments\r\nexhibit no sensible alteration. Fossiliferous limestones and shales\r\noften retain their organic remains so unchanged that specimens taken\r\nout of the agglomerate cannot be distinguished from those gathered from\r\nthe strata lying _in situ_ outside. Some stones have evidently been\r\nderived from a deeper part of the chimney, where they have been exposed\r\nto a higher temperature than others, or they may have been lain longer\r\nwithin the influence of hot ascending vapours.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic materials in agglomerate range in size from the finest\r\ndust to blocks several yards in length, with occasionally even much\r\nlarger masses. The proportions of dust to stones vary indefinitely, the\r\nfiner material sometimes merely filling in the interstices between the\r\nstones, at other times forming a considerable part of the whole mass.\r\n\r\nThe stones of an agglomerate may be angular or subangular, but are\r\nmore usually somewhat rounded. Many of them are obviously pieces that\r\nhave been broken from already solid rock and have had their edges\r\nrounded by attrition, probably by knocking against each other and\r\nthe walls of the chimney as they were hurled up and fell back again.\r\nTheir frequently angular shapes negative the supposition that they\r\ncould have been produced by the discharge of spurts of still liquid\r\nlava. As already stated, they have probably been in large measure\r\nderived from the violent disruption of the solidified cake or crust\r\non the top of the column of lava in the pipe. Many of them may have\r\nbeen broken off from the layer of congealed lava that partially coated\r\nthe rough walls of the funnel after successive uprises of the molten\r\nmaterial. Among them may be observed many large and small blocks that\r\nappear to have been derived from the disruption of true lava-streams,\r\nas if beds of lava had been pierced in the formation of the vent, or\r\nas if those that congealed on the slopes of the cone had been broken\r\nup by subsequent explosions. These fragments of lava are sometimes\r\nstrongly amygdaloidal. A characteristic feature, indeed, of the blocks\r\nof volcanic material in the agglomerates is their frequent cellular\r\nstructure. Many of them may be described as rough slags or scoriæ.\r\nThese have generally come from the spongy crust or upper part of the\r\nlava where the imprisoned steam, relieved from pressure, is able to\r\nexpand and gather into vesicles.\r\n\r\nLess frequently evidence is obtainable that the blocks were partially\r\nor wholly molten at the time of expulsion. Sometimes, for example, a\r\nmass which presents on one side such a broken face as to indicate that\r\nit came from already solidified material, will show on the other that\r\nits steam-vesicles have been pulled out in such a way as to conform to\r\nthe rounded surface of the block. This elongation could only take place\r\nin lava that was not yet wholly consolidated. It seems to indicate that\r\nsuch blocks were derived from a thin hardened crust lying upon still\r\nmolten material, and that they carried up parts of that material with\r\nthem. As each stone went whirling up the funnel into the open air, its\r\nmelted part would be drawn round the gyrating mass, and would rapidly\r\ncool there.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, we encounter true volcanic bombs, that is, rounded or\r\nbomb-shaped blocks of lava, with their vesicles elongated all round\r\nthem and conforming to their spherical shape. Sometimes such blocks are\r\nsingularly vesicular in the centre, with a more close-grained crust\r\non the outside. Their rapid centrifugal motion during flight would\r\nallow of the greater expansion of the dissolved steam in the central\r\npart of each mass, while the outer parts would be quickly chilled, and\r\nwould assume a more compact texture. Bombs of this kind are met with\r\namong ancient volcanic products, and, like those of modern volcanoes,\r\nhave obviously been produced by the ejection of spurts or gobbets of\r\nlava from the surface of a mass in a state of violent ebullition.\r\nOccasionally they are hollow inside, the rotation in these cases having\r\nprobably been exceptionally rapid.\r\n\r\nPassing from the larger blocks to the smaller fragments, we notice\r\nthe great abundance of nut-like subangular or rounded pieces of lava\r\nin the agglomerates. These include lumps of fine grain not specially\r\nvesicular, and probably derived from the disruption of solidified\r\nrock. But in many agglomerates, especially those associated with the\r\noutpouring of basalts or other basic lavas (as those of Carboniferous\r\nand Tertiary age described in later chapters), they comprise also vast\r\nnumbers of very finely cellular material or pumice. These pumiceous\r\nlapilli have been already alluded to as ingredients of the stratified\r\ntuffs. But they are still more characteristic of the necks, and reach\r\nthere a larger size, ranging from the finest grains up to lumps as\r\nlarge as a hen's egg, or even larger.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar distinctions of this ejected pumice are the extreme\r\nminuteness of its vesicles, their remarkable abundance, their prevalent\r\nspherical forms, and the thinness of the walls which separate them.\r\nIn these respects they present a marked contrast to the large\r\nirregularly-shaped steam-cavities of the outflowing lavas, or even of\r\nthe scoriæ in the agglomerates.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic minutely vesicular pumice is basic in composition.\r\nWhere not too much decayed, it may be recognized as a basic glass.\r\nThus among the remarkable agglomerates which fill up the Pliocene or\r\nPleistocene vents of the Velay, the fragments consist of a dark very\r\nbasic glass, which encloses such a multitude of minute steam-cavities\r\nthat, when seen under the microscope, they are found to be separated\r\nfrom each other by walls so thin that the slice looks like a pattern\r\nof delicate lace.[25] In necks of earlier date, such as those of older\r\nTertiary, and still more of Palæozoic, time, the glass has generally\r\nbeen altered into some palagonitic material.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: M. Boule, _Bull. Cart. Géol. France_, No. 28, tome iv.\r\n(1892) p. 193.]\r\n\r\nThis finely pumiceous substance appears to be peculiar to the vents and\r\nto the deposits of tuff immediately derived from them. It is not found,\r\nso far as I know, among any of the superficial lavas, and, of course,\r\nwould not be looked for among intrusive rocks. It was evidently a\r\nspecial product of the volcanic chimney, as distinguished from the mass\r\nof the magma below. We may perhaps regards it as in some way due to a\r\nprocess of quiet simmering within the vent, when the continual passage\r\nof ascending vapours kept the molten lava there in ebullition, and gave\r\nit its special frothy or finely pumiceous character.\r\n\r\nThe compacted dust, sand or gravelly detritus found in necks, and\r\ncomprised under the general name of Tuff, consists partly of the\r\nfiner particles produced during the violent disruption of already\r\nsolidified rocks, partly of the detritus arising from the friction and\r\nimpact of stones ascending and descending above an active vent during\r\ntimes of eruption, and partly of the extremely light dust or ash into\r\nwhich molten lava may be blown by violent volcanic explosions. In\r\nold volcanic necks, where the rocks have long been subjected to the\r\ninfluence of percolating meteoric water, it is not perhaps possible\r\nto discriminate, except in a rough way, the products from these three\r\nsources. The more minutely comminuted material has generally undergone\r\nconsiderable alteration, so that under the microscope it seldom reveals\r\nany distinctive structures. Here and there in a slide, traces may\r\noccasionally be detected of loose volcanic microlites, though more\r\nusually these can only be found in lapilli of altered glass or finely\r\npumiceous lava.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the detritus in a neck of agglomerate or tuff has\r\nalmost always a close relation to that of any lavas which may have been\r\nemitted from that vent. If the lavas have been of an acid character,\r\nsuch as rhyolites, felsites or obsidians, the pyroclastic materials\r\nwill almost always be found to be also acid. Where, on the other hand,\r\nthe lavas have been intermediate or basic, so also will be the tuffs\r\nand agglomerates. Occasionally, however, as has already been pointed\r\nout, from the same or closely adjoining vents lavas of very different\r\nchemical composition have been successively erupted. Felsites or\r\nrhyolites have alternated with diabases, basalts or andesites. In such\r\ncases, a commingling of acid and basic detritus may be observed, as,\r\nfor example, among the volcanoes of the Old Red Sandstone. It has even\r\nhappened sometimes that such a mixture of material has taken place when\r\nonly one class of lavas has been poured out at the surface, as in the\r\nagglomerates that fill vents among the basalts of the Inner Hebrides.\r\nBut we may be sure that, though not discharged at the surface, the\r\nlavas of which pieces are found in the tuffs must have risen high\r\nenough in the vents to be actually blown out in a fragmentary form.\r\nThe occurrence of felsitic fragments among the otherwise basic\r\nagglomerates of Mull and Skye will be described in subsequent pages,\r\nlikewise the intercalation of rhyolitic detritus between the basalts of\r\nAntrim. A similar association occurs among the modern vents of Iceland.\r\n\r\nAmong the contents of the tuffs and agglomerates that occupy old\r\nvolcanic vents, some are occasionally to be observed of which the\r\nsource is not easily conjectured. Detached crystals of various\r\nminerals sometimes occur abundantly which were certainly not formed\r\n_in situ_, but must have been ejected as loose lapilli with the other\r\nvolcanic detritus. Where these crystals belong to minerals that enter\r\ninto the composition of the lavas of the district in which they are\r\nfound, they may be regarded as having probably been derived from the\r\nexplosion of such lavas in the vents, the molten magma being blown into\r\ndust, and its already formed crystals being liberated and expelled\r\nas separate grains. But it seems to be extremely rare to find any\r\nneighbouring lava in which the minerals in question are so largely and\r\nso perfectly crystallized as they are in these loose crystals of the\r\nneck. The beautifully complete crystals of augite found in the old\r\ntuffs of Vesuvius and on the flanks of Stromboli may be paralleled\r\namong Palæozoic tuffs and agglomerates in Britain. Thus the necks\r\nbelonging to the Arenig and Llandeilo volcanoes of southern Scotland\r\nare sometimes crowded with augite, varying from minute seed-like\r\ngrains up to perfectly formed crystals as large as hazel nuts. The\r\nconditions under which such well-shaped idiomorphic minerals were\r\nformed were probably different from those that governed the cooling and\r\nconsolidation of the ordinary lavas.\r\n\r\nBut besides the minerals that may be claimed as belonging to the\r\nvolcanic series of a district, others occur not infrequently in some\r\ntuff-necks, the origin of which is extremely puzzling. Such are the\r\nlarge felspars, micas, garnets and the various gems that have been\r\nobtained from necks. The large size of some of these crystals and\r\ntheir frequently perfect crystallographic forms negative the idea that\r\nthey can, as a rule, be derived from the destruction of any known\r\nrocks, though they may sometimes be conceivably the residue left after\r\nthe solution of the other constituents of a rock by the underground\r\nmagma, like the large residual felspars enclosed in some dykes. The\r\ncrystals in question, however, seem rather to point to some chemical\r\nprocesses still unknown, which, in the depths of a volcanic focus,\r\nunder conditions of pressure and temperature which we may speculate\r\nabout but can perhaps hardly ever imitate in our laboratories, lead to\r\nthe elaboration of the diamond, garnet, sahlite, smaragdite, zircon and\r\nother minerals.[26] Examples of such foreign or deep-seated crystals\r\nwill be described from the probably Permian necks of Central Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: For lists of the minerals found in the diamond-bearing\r\nnecks of Kimberley, see M. Boutan in Frémy's _Encyclopédie Chimique_\r\n(1886), vol. ii. p. 168; Dr. M. Bauer's _Edelsteinkunde_ (1895), p.\r\n223.]\r\n\r\nWhatsoever may be the source and nature of the fragmentary materials\r\nthat fill old volcanic vents, they present, as a general rule, no\r\ndefinite arrangement in the necks. Blocks of all sizes are scattered\r\npromiscuously through the agglomerate, just as they fell back into\r\nthe chimney and came to rest there. The larger masses are placed at\r\nall angles, or stand on end, and are sometimes especially conspicuous\r\nin the centre of a neck, though more usually dispersed through the\r\nwhole. Such a thoroughly tumultuous accumulation is precisely what\r\nmight be expected where explosions have taken place in still liquid\r\nand in already consolidated lavas, and where the materials, violently\r\ndischarged to the surface, have fallen back and come finally to rest in\r\nthe chimney of the volcano.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this absence of arrangement sometimes gives place to\r\na stratification which becomes more distinct in proportion as the\r\nmaterial of the vent passes from coarse agglomerate into fine tuff. It\r\nis possible that the existence and development of this structure depend\r\non the depth at which the materials accumulate in the funnel. We may\r\nconceive, for instance, that in the lower parts of the chimney, the\r\nstones and dust, tumultuously falling and rebounding from projections\r\nof the rugged walls, will hardly be likely to show much trace of\r\narrangement, though even there, if the explosions continue to keep an\r\nopen though diminishing passage in the vent, alternations of coarser\r\nand finer layers, marking varying phases of eruptivity, may be formed\r\nin the gradually heightening pile of agglomerate. Rude indications of\r\nsome such alternations may sometimes be detected in what are otherwise\r\nquite unstratified necks.\r\n\r\nIn the upper part of a volcanic funnel, however, close to and even\r\nwithin the crater, the conditions are not so unfavourable to the\r\nproduction of a stratified arrangement. As the pipe is filled up, and\r\nthe activity of eruption lessens, explosions may occur only from the\r\nvery middle of the orifice. The debris that falls back into the vent\r\nwill gather most thickly round the walls, whence it will slide down\r\nto the central, still eruptive hole. It will thus assume a stratified\r\narrangement, the successive layers lying at the steepest angles of\r\nrepose, or from 30° to 35°, and dipping down in an inverted conical\r\ndisposition towards the centre. If the process should continue long\r\nenough, the crater itself may be partially or completely filled up with\r\ndetritus (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\nOf this gradual infilling of a volcanic chimney with stratified\r\nagglomerate and tuff, examples belonging to different geological\r\nperiods will be cited in subsequent chapters. I may here especially\r\nallude to one of the most recently observed and best marked\r\nillustrations, which occurs on the west side of Stromö, in the Faroe\r\nIslands (see Figs. 310, 311, 312). A neck has there been filled up\r\nwith coarse agglomerate, which is rudely stratified, the layers\r\ndipping steeply into the centre, where the tumultuous assemblage of\r\nlarge blocks no doubt points to the final choking up of the diminished\r\norifice of explosion. The walls of the neck are nearly vertical, and\r\nconsist of the bedded basaltic lavas through which the vent has been\r\nopened. They terminate upward in a conical expansion, evidently the old\r\ncrater, which has subsequently been filled up by the inroads of several\r\nlava-streams from adjacent vents. It is here manifest that the bedded\r\nagglomerate belongs to the uppermost part of the volcanic funnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Neck filled with stratified tuff. A. ground\r\nplan; B. transverse section.]\r\n\r\nWhere vents have been filled up with tuff rather than with agglomerate,\r\nthe stratified structure is best developed. Alternations of coarser and\r\nfiner detritus give rise to more or less definite layers, which, though\r\ninconstant and irregular, serve to impart a distinctly stratified\r\ncharacter to the mass. Where there has been no subsequent disturbance\r\nwithin a vent, these layers show the same inward dip towards the centre\r\njust referred to, at the ordinary angles of repose. Now and then, where\r\na neck with this structure has been laid bare on a beach, its denuded\r\ncross-section presents a series of concentric rings of strata from the\r\nwalls towards the centre. Good illustrations of these features are\r\nsupplied by the probably Permian necks of eastern Fife (Figs. 25 A and\r\n217).[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See also the sections of vents on the west coast of\r\nStromö Faroes, above referred to.]\r\n\r\nIt has frequently happened, however, that, owing to subsidence of the\r\nmaterials filling up the vents or to later volcanic disturbances, the\r\ncompacted tuffs have been broken up and thrown into various positions,\r\nlarge masses being even placed on end. Among the Carboniferous and\r\nPermian necks of Central Scotland such dislocated and vertical tuffs\r\nare of common occurrence (see Figs. 145, 218). If, as is probable, we\r\nare justified in regarding the stratified parts of necks as indicative\r\nof the uppermost parts of volcanic funnels, not far from the surface,\r\nthe importance of this inference will be best understood when the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian volcanoes are described.\r\n\r\n(3) _Necks with a central Lava-plug._--Some vents of agglomerate or\r\ntuff are pierced by a plug of lava, as may be instructively seen in\r\nmany of the Carboniferous and Permian necks of the centre and south of\r\nScotland (Fig. 26; compare also Figs. 148, 174, 207, and 226). Where\r\nthis structure shows itself, the contrast in hardness and durability\r\nbetween the more destructible fragmentary material and the solid\r\nresisting lava leads to a topographical distinction in the outer forms\r\nof necks. The smooth declivities of the friable tuffs are crowned or\r\ninterrupted by more craggy features, which mark the position of the\r\nharder intrusive rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Section of neck of agglomerate (_a_ _a_) with\r\nplug of lava (_b_).]\r\n\r\nThe plug, like the pipe up which it has risen, is in general\r\nirregularly circular in ground-plan. It may be conceived to be a column\r\nof rock, descending to an unknown depth into the interior, with a\r\ncasing of pyroclastic debris surrounding it. It may vary considerably\r\nin the proportion which its cross-section bears to that of the\r\nsurrounding fragmental material. Sometimes it does not occupy more than\r\na small part of the whole, often appearing in the centre. In other\r\ncases, it more than equals all the rest of the material in the vent,\r\nwhile instances may be noted where only occasional patches of tuff\r\nor agglomerate are visible between the lava-plug and the wall of the\r\npipe. From these we naturally pass to the second type of vent, where\r\nno fragmentary material is to be seen, but where the chimney is now\r\nentirely filled with some massive once-molten rock.\r\n\r\nA neck with a lava-plug probably contains the records of two stages\r\nin volcanic progress, the first of which, indicated by the tuff or\r\nagglomerate, was confined to the discharge of fragmentary materials;\r\nwhile the second, shown by the lava-plug, belonged to the time when,\r\nafter the earlier explosions, lava ascended in the vent and solidified\r\nthere, thus bringing the eruptions from that particular orifice to\r\nan end. Where a small central column of lava rises through the tuff,\r\nwe may suppose that the funnel had been mainly choked up by the\r\naccumulation in it of ejected detritus, which was compacted to a solid\r\nmass adhering to the wall of the funnel, but leaving a central orifice\r\nto be kept open by the gradually waning energy of the volcano. By a\r\nfinal effort that impelled molten rock up that duct and allowed it to\r\nconsolidate there, the operations of the vent were brought to a close.\r\n\r\nWhere, on the other hand, only occasional strips of tuff or agglomerate\r\nare to be found between the lava-plug and the wall of the pipe, the\r\nlast uprise of lava may be supposed to have been preceded by more\r\nvigorous explosions which cleared the throat of the volcano, driving\r\nout the accumulated detritus and leaving only scattered patches\r\nadhering to the sides of the funnel.\r\n\r\nThere is, no doubt, some downward limit to the production of\r\nfragmentary material, and if we could lay bare successive levels in the\r\nchimney of a volcano we should find the agglomerate eventually replaced\r\nentirely by lava.\r\n\r\nThe materials of the lava-plugs vary widely in composition. Sometimes\r\nthey are remarkably basic, and present rocks of the picrite or\r\nlimburgite type; in other cases they are thoroughly acid rocks such\r\nas felsite and granophyre. Many intermediate varieties may be found\r\nbetween these extremes. It is noteworthy that, in districts where the\r\nlavas erupted to the surface have been andesitic or basaltic, the\r\nmaterial which has finally solidified in the vents is often more acid\r\nin composition, trachytic rocks being specially frequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Section of agglomerate neck (_a_ _a_) with\r\ndykes and veins (_b_ _b_).]\r\n\r\n(4) _Necks with Dykes, Veins, or irregular intrusions of Lava._--While\r\nthe presence of a central plug of lava in a neck of fragmental material\r\nmay indicate that the vent was still to some extent open, there is\r\nanother structure which seems to point to the ascent of lava after\r\nthe funnel has been choked up. Numerous instances have been observed\r\nwhere lava has been forced upward through rents in a mass of tuff\r\nor agglomerate, and has solidified there in the form of dykes or\r\nveins (Fig. 27). Illustrations of this structure abound among the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian necks of Britain. Here, again, though on a\r\nless marked scale, the contrast in the amount and character of the\r\nweathering of the two groups of rock gives rise to corresponding\r\ntopographical features, which are especially observable in cliffs and\r\ncoast-sections, where the dykes and veins project out of the tuffs as\r\ndark prominent walls (Figs. 135, 149, 166, 168, 219, 221, 222).\r\n\r\nThese intrusive injections are generally irregular in their forms, the\r\nlava having evidently been driven through a mass of material which, not\r\nhaving yet consolidated sufficiently to acquire a jointed structure,\r\nafforded few dominant lines of division along which it could ascend.\r\nNow and then, however, sharply defined dykes or veins, which at a\r\ndistance look like dark ribbons, may be seen running vertically or at\r\na high angle, and with a straight or wavy course, through the fine\r\ncompacted tuff of a vent. Frequently the injected material has found\r\nits readiest line of ascent along the walls of the funnel, between the\r\ntuff and the surrounding rocks. Occasionally it has made its way into\r\nrents in these rocks, as well as into the body of the neck.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark in passing that complete consolidation of the\r\nfragmentary material does not appear to be always requisite in order\r\nto allow of the formation of such fissures as are needed for the\r\nproduction of dykes. A singularly interesting illustration of this fact\r\nmay be seen on the northern crest of the outer crater of the Puy Pariou\r\nin Auvergne. A dyke of andesite 8 or 10 feet broad may there be traced\r\nrunning for a distance of about 300 yards through the loose material\r\nof the cone. The rock is highly vesicular, and the vesicles have been\r\nelongated in the direction of the course of the dyke so as to impart a\r\nsomewhat fissile structure to the mass.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the dykes and veins which traverse\r\nnecks of agglomerate belong to one of the closing phases in the\r\nhistory of the vents in which they occur. They could only have been\r\ninjected after the pipes had been so choked up that explosions had\r\nalmost or entirely ceased, and eruptions had consequently become\r\nnearly or quite impossible. They show, however, that volcanic energy\r\nstill continued to manifest itself by impelling the molten magma\r\ninto these extinct funnels, while at the same time it may have been\r\nactively discharging materials from other still open vents in the same\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the composition of these dykes and veins, it may be\r\nremarked that in a district of acid lavas they may be expected to be\r\nfelsitic or rhyolitic, sometimes granophyric. Where, on the other\r\nhand, the lavas poured out at the surface have been intermediate or\r\nbasic, the veins in the necks may be andesites, basalts or other still\r\nmore basic compounds. But it is observable, as in the case of the\r\nlava-plugs, that the injections into the necks may be much more acid\r\nthan any of the superficial lavas. The advent of acid material in the\r\nlater part of a volcano's history has been already alluded to, and many\r\nexamples of it will be given in this work.\r\n\r\nAfter all explosions and eruptions have ceased, heated vapours may\r\nstill for a long period continue to make their way upward through the\r\nloose spongy detritus filling up the vent. The ascent of such vapours,\r\nand more particularly of steam, may induce considerable metamorphism of\r\nthe agglomerate, as is more particularly noticed at p. 71.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Necks of Lava-form Material_\r\n\r\nThe second type of neck is that in which the volcanic pipe has been\r\nentirely filled up with some massive or crystalline rock. As already\r\nremarked, it is not always possible to be certain that bosses of rock,\r\nhaving the external form of necks of this kind, mark the sites of\r\nactual volcanic orifices. Eruptive material that has never reached\r\nthe surface, but has been injected into the crust of the earth, has\r\nsometimes solidified there in forms which, when subsequently exposed\r\nby denudation, present a deceptive resemblance to true volcanic necks.\r\nEach example must be examined by itself, and its probable origin must\r\nbe determined by a consideration of all the circumstances connected\r\nwith it. Where other evidence exists of volcanic activity, such, for\r\ninstance, as the presence of bedded tuffs or intercalated sheets of\r\nlava, the occurrence of neck-like eminences or bosses of felsite,\r\nandesite, dolerite, basalt or other eruptive rock, would furnish a\r\npresumption that these marked the sites of some of the active vents of\r\nthe period to which the tuffs and lavas belonged.\r\n\r\nIf a neck-like eminence of this kind were found to possess a circular\r\nor elliptical ground-plan, and to descend vertically like a huge pillar\r\ninto the crust of the earth; if the surrounding rocks were bent down\r\ntowards it and altered in the manner which I shall afterwards describe\r\nin detail; if, moreover, the material composing the eminence were\r\nascertained to be closely related petrographically to some parts of the\r\nsurrounding volcanic series, it might with some confidence be set down\r\nas marking the place of one of the active vents from which that series\r\nwas ejected.\r\n\r\nThe chief contrast in external form between this type of neck and\r\nthat formed of fragmentary material arises from differences in the\r\nrelative durability of their component substance. The various kinds of\r\nlava-form rock found in necks are, as a whole, much harder and more\r\nindestructible than agglomerates and tuffs. Consequently bosses of them\r\nare apt to stand out more prominently. They mount into higher points,\r\npresent steeper declivities, and are scarped into more rugged crags.\r\nBut essentially they are characterized by similar conical outlines, and\r\nby rising in the same solitary and abrupt way from lower ground around\r\nthem (see Figs. 109, 133, and 195, 294).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Section of neck filled with massive rock.]\r\n\r\nVarious joint-structures may be observed in these necks. In some cases\r\nthere is a tendency to separate into joints parallel to the bounding\r\nwalls, and occasionally this arrangement goes so far that the rock has\r\nacquired a fissile structure as if it were composed of vertical strata.\r\nIn other instances, the rock shows a columnar structure, the columns\r\ndiverging from the outer margin, or curving inwards, or displaying\r\nvarious irregular groupings. More usually, however, this jointing is so\r\nindefinite that no satisfactory connection can be traced between it and\r\nthe walls of the orifice in which the rock has solidified.\r\n\r\nSome of the most remarkable examples of necks ever figured and\r\ndescribed are those to which attention was called by Captain Dutton as\r\ndisplayed in the Zuni plateau of New Mexico, where, amid wide denuded\r\nsheets of basalt, numerous prominent crags mark the sites of eruptive\r\nvents. The basalt of these eminences is columnar, the columns standing\r\nor lying in all sorts of attitudes, and in most cases curved.[28] In\r\nthe Upper Velay, in Central France, numerous conspicuous domes and\r\ncones of phonolite rise amidst the much-worn basalt-plateau of that\r\nregion (Fig. 345). Many instances will be cited in later chapters from\r\nthe British Isles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _U.S. Geol. Survey, 6th Annual Report_, 1884-85, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Distribution of Vents in Relation to Geological Structure-lines_\r\n\r\nWhere the positions of true volcanic necks can be accurately\r\ndetermined, it is interesting to study their distribution and their\r\nrelation to the main lines of geological structure around them.\r\nSometimes a distinct linear arrangement can be detected in their\r\ngrouping. Those of the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Central Scotland,\r\nfor instance, can be followed in lines for distances of many miles\r\n(Map No. III). Yet when we try to trace the connection of such\r\nan arrangement with any known great lines of dislocation in the\r\nterrestrial crust, we can seldom establish it satisfactorily. In the\r\ncase of the Scottish Old Red Sandstone just cited, it is obvious that\r\nthe vents were opened along a broad belt of subsidence between the\r\nmountains of crystalline schist on the north, and those of convoluted\r\nSilurian strata on the south, either margin of that belt being\r\nsubsequently, if not then, defined by lines of powerful fault. No vents\r\nhave risen along these faults, nor has any relation been detected\r\nbetween the sites of the volcanic foci and dislocations in the area of\r\nancient depression.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may be asserted of the vents of Britain that they are\r\nusually entirely independent of any faults that traverse at least the\r\nupper visible part of the earth's crust. They sometimes rise close to\r\nsuch lines of fracture without touching them, but they are equally well\r\ndeveloped where no fractures are to be found. Now and then one of them\r\nmay be observed rising along a line of fault, but such a coincidence\r\ncould hardly fail occasionally to happen. From the evidence in the\r\nBritish Isles, it is quite certain that if volcanic vents have, as is\r\npossible, risen preferably along lines of fissure in the terrestrial\r\ncrust, these lines are seldom those of the visible superficial faults,\r\nbut must lie much deeper, and are not generally prolonged upward to the\r\nsurface. The frequent recurrence of volcanic outbursts at successive\r\ngeological periods from the same or adjacent vents seems to point\r\nto the existence of lines or points of weakness deep down in the\r\ncrust, within reach of the internal molten magma, but far beneath the\r\nhorizon of the stratified formations at the surface, with their more\r\nsuperficial displacements.\r\n\r\nWhile sometimes running in lines, old volcanic vents of the Vesuvian\r\nand Puy types often occur also in scattered groups. Two or three may\r\nbe found together within an area of a few hundred yards. Then may come\r\nan interval where none, or possibly only a solitary individual, may\r\nappear. And beyond that space may rise another sporadic group. These\r\nfeatures are well exhibited by the Carboniferous and Permian series of\r\nScotland, to the account of which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\nA large neck may have a number of smaller ones placed around it, just\r\nas a modern Vesuvian cone has smaller parasitic cones upon its flanks.\r\nAn instructive example of this arrangement is to be seen at the great\r\nvent of the Braid Hills belonging to the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nand described in Chapter xx. Other instances may be cited from the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian volcanic series (see Figs. 90, 148, 213).\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the irregularities in the ground-plan of a neck, as\r\nalready remarked, may be accounted for on the supposition that they\r\nmark the site of more than one vent. Sometimes, indeed, it is possible\r\nto demonstrate the existence of two or even more vents which have\r\nbeen successively opened nearly on the same spot. The first orifice\r\nhaving become choked up, another has broken out a little to one side,\r\nwhich in turn ceasing to be effective from the same or some other\r\ncause, has been succeeded by a third (Fig. 29). The three cones and\r\ncraters of the little island of Volcanello supply a singularly perfect\r\nrecent instance of this structure (Fig. 214). Here the funnel has\r\ntwice shifted its position, each cone becoming successively smaller\r\nand partially effacing that which preceded it. In Auvergne, the Puy de\r\nPariou has long been celebrated as an example of a fresh cinder-cone\r\npartially effacing an earlier one. In the much denuded Palæozoic\r\nvolcanic tracts of Britain, where the cones have long since disappeared\r\nand only the stumps of the volcanic cylinders are left, many\r\nillustrations occur of a similar displacement of the funnel, especially\r\namong the volcanoes of the Carboniferous system.\r\n\r\nAmong the irregularities of necks that may indicate a connection with\r\nlines of fissure, reference may be made here to dykes or dyke-like\r\nmasses of agglomerate which are sometimes to be seen among the volcanic\r\ndistricts of Britain. In these cases the fragmentary materials, instead\r\nof lying in a more or less cylindrical pipe, appear to fill up a long\r\nfissure. We may suppose that the explosions which produced them did\r\nactually occur in fissures instead of in ordinary vents. The remarkable\r\nIcelandic fissures with their long rows of cinder cones are doubtless,\r\nat least in their upper parts, largely filled up with slag and scoriæ.\r\nSome illustrations of this structure will be given in the account of\r\nthe Carboniferous volcanic rocks of Scotland (see No. 1 in Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Successive shiftings of vents giving rise to\r\ndouble or triple cones. A, ground-plan; B, vertical section.]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another consideration in regard to the form and size of\r\nnecks which deserves attention. Where the actual margin of a neck and\r\nits line of vertical junction with the rocks through which it has been\r\ndrilled can be seen, there is no room for dispute as to the diameter\r\nof the original funnel, which must have been that of the actual neck.\r\nBut in many cases it is impossible to observe the boundary; not merely\r\nbecause of superficial soil or drift, but occasionally because the\r\nvolcanic detritus extends beyond the actual limits of the funnel.\r\nIn such cases the necks have retained some portion of the original\r\nvolcanic cone which accumulated on the surface around the eruptive\r\nvent. It may even chance that what appears to be a large neck would be\r\nconsiderably reduced in diameter, and might be shown to include more\r\nthan one pipe if all this outer casing could be removed from it. In\r\nFig. 30, for example, a section is given of a neck (_n_) from which on\r\nthe right-hand side all the cone and surrounding tuffs (_t_) have been\r\nremoved by denudation, the original form of the volcano being suggested\r\nby the dotted lines. On the left side, however, the tuffs which were\r\ninterstratified with the contemporaneous sediments are still connected\r\nwith the neck, denudation not having yet severed them from it. The\r\noverlying strata (_l_, _l_) which originally overspread the extinct\r\nvolcano have been bent into an anticline, and the neck of the vent has\r\nthus been laid bare by the removal of the crest of the arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Section to show the connection of a neck with\r\na cone and surrounding bedded tuffs.]\r\n\r\nThe instances where a structure of this kind is concealed are probably\r\nfewer in number in proportion to their antiquity. But among Tertiary\r\ncones they may perhaps not be so rare. The possibility of their\r\noccurrence should be kept in view during the investigation of extinct\r\nvolcanoes. The term Neck ought not properly to be applied to such\r\ndegraded volcanic cones. The true neck still remains preserved in the\r\ninside of them. As illustrative of the structure here referred to, I\r\nmay cite the example of the Saline Hill (Fig. 148) and of Largo Law\r\n(Fig. 226), both in Fife.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. _Metamorphism in and around Volcanic Vents--Solfataric Action_\r\n\r\nThe prolonged ascent of hot vapours, stones, dust and lava, in the\r\nfunnel of a volcano must necessarily affect the rocks through which\r\nthe funnel has been driven. We may therefore expect some signs of\r\nalteration in the material forming the walls of a volcanic neck. The\r\nnature of the metamorphism will no doubt depend, in the first place,\r\non the character and duration of the agents producing it, and in the\r\nsecond, on the susceptibility of the rocks to undergo change. Mere heat\r\nwill indurate rocks, baking sandstone, for instance, into quartzite,\r\nand shales into porcellanite. But there will almost invariably be\r\ncauses of alteration other than mere high temperature. Water-vapour,\r\nfor instance, has probably always been one of the most abundant and\r\nmost powerful of them. The copious evolution of steam from volcanoes\r\nis one of their most characteristic features at the present day,\r\nand that it was equally so in past time seems to be put beyond\r\nquestion by the constantly recurring vesicular structure in ancient\r\nlavas and in the lapilli and ejected blocks of old agglomerates and\r\ntuffs. Direct experiment has demonstrated, in the hands of various\r\nskilful observers, from the time of Sir James Hall to that of\r\nProfessor Daubrée, how powerfully rocks are acted upon when exposed\r\nto superheated vapour of water under great pressure. But the steam of\r\nvolcanoes often contains other vapours or mineralizing agents dissolved\r\nin it, which increase its metamorphic influence. The mineral acids, for\r\ninstance, must exert a powerful effect in corroding most minerals and\r\nrocks. At the Solfatara of Naples and at other volcanic orifices in\r\ndifferent parts of Italy, considerable alteration is seen to be due to\r\nthis cause.\r\n\r\nBearing these well-known facts in mind, we may be prepared to find\r\nvarious proofs of metamorphism around and within old volcanic vents.\r\nThe surrounding rocks are generally much hardened immediately\r\ncontiguous to a neck, whether its materials be fragmental or massive.\r\nSandstones, for example, are often markedly bleached, acquire the\r\nvitreous lustre and texture of quartzite, lose their usual fissility,\r\nbreak irregularly into angular blocks, and on an exposed surface\r\nproject above the level of the unaltered parts beyond. Shales are\r\nbaked into a kind of porcelain-like substance. Coal-seams are entirely\r\ndestroyed for economic purposes, having been burnt into a kind of\r\ncinder or fused into a blistered slag-like mass. Limestones likewise\r\nlose their usual bluish-grey tint, become white and hard, and assume\r\nthe saccaroid texture of marble.\r\n\r\nThe distance to which this metamorphism extends from the wall is,\r\namong the exposed necks in Britain, smaller than might be anticipated.\r\nThus I have seldom been able to trace it among those of Carboniferous\r\nor Permian age for more than 15 or 20 yards in ordinary arenaceous\r\nand argillaceous strata, even where every detail of a neck and its\r\nsurroundings has been laid bare in plan upon a beach. The alteration\r\nseems to reach furthest in carbonaceous seams, such as coals.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the element of time must enter into the question\r\nof the amount of metamorphism produced in the terrestrial crust\r\nimmediately surrounding a volcanic pipe. A volcano, of which the\r\neruptions begin and end within an interval of a few days or hours,\r\ncannot be expected to have had much metamorphic influence on the rocks\r\nthrough which its vent was opened. On the other hand, around a funnel\r\nwhich served for many centuries as a channel for the escape of hot\r\nvapours, ashes or lava to the surface, there could hardly fail to be\r\na considerable amount of alteration. The absence or comparatively\r\nslight development of metamorphism at the Carboniferous and Permian\r\nnecks of Scotland may perhaps be regarded as some indication that these\r\nvolcanoes were generally short-lived. On the other hand, more extensive\r\nalteration may be taken as pointing to a longer continuance of eruptive\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\nThe same causes which have induced metamorphism in the rocks\r\nsurrounding a volcanic vent might obviously effect it also among the\r\nfragmentary materials by which the vent may have been filled up. When\r\nthe eruptions ceased and the funnel was left choked with volcanic\r\ndebris, hot vapours and gases would no doubt still continue for a time\r\nto find their way upward through the loose or partially compacted mass.\r\nIn their ascent they would permeate this material, and in the end\r\nproduce in it a series of changes similar to, and possibly even more\r\npronounced than, those traceable in the walls of the vent. Instances of\r\nthis kind of metamorphism will be cited in the following chapters (see\r\nin particular p. 404).\r\n\r\n\r\nv. _Inward Dip of Docks towards Necks_\r\n\r\nOne concluding observation requires to be made regarding the relation\r\nof old volcanic necks to the rocks which immediately surround them.\r\nWhere a vent has been opened through massive rocks, such as granite,\r\nfelsite, andesite or basalt, it is generally difficult or impossible\r\nto determine whether there has been any displacement of these rocks,\r\nbeyond the disruption of them caused by the explosions that blew out\r\nthe orifice. But where the pipe has been drilled through stratified\r\nrocks, especially when these still lie nearly flat, the planes of\r\nstratification usually supply a ready test and measure of any such\r\nmovement. Investigation of the volcanic rocks of Britain has shown me\r\nthat where any displacement can be detected at a neck, it is almost\r\ninvariably in a downward direction. The strata immediately around\r\nthe vent tend to dip towards it, whatever may be their prevalent\r\ninclination in the ground beyond (Fig. 24). This is the reverse of the\r\nposition which might have been expected. It is so frequent, however,\r\nthat it appears to indicate a general tendency to subsidence at the\r\nsites of volcanic vents. After copious eruptions, large cavernous\r\nspaces may conceivably be left at the roots of volcanoes, and the\r\nmaterials that have filled the vents, losing support underneath, will\r\ntend to gravitate downwards, and if firmly welded to their surrounding\r\nwalls may drag these irregularly down with them. Examples of such\r\nsagging structures are abundantly to be seen among the dissected vents\r\nof the Carboniferous and Permian volcanic series of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. _Influence of Contemporaneous Denudation upon Volcanic Cones_\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that former vents, except those of the\r\nlater geological periods, are revealed at the surface now only\r\nafter extensive denudation. As a rule, the volcanoes that formed\r\nthem appeared and continued in eruption during periods of general\r\nsubsidence, and were one by one submerged and buried beneath subaqueous\r\ndeposits. We can conceive that, while a volcanic cone was sinking\r\nunder water, it might be seriously altered in form and height by waves\r\nand currents. If it consisted of loose ashes and stones, it might be\r\nentirely levelled, and its material might be strewn over the floor of\r\nthe sea or lake in which it stood. But, as has been already pointed\r\nout, the destruction of the cone would still leave the choked-up pipe\r\nor funnel from which the materials of that cone had been ejected.\r\nThough, during the subsidence, every outward vestige of the actual\r\nvolcano might disappear, yet the agglomerate or lava that solidified\r\nin the funnel underneath would remain. And if these materials had\r\nrisen some way within the cone or crater, or if they reached at least\r\na higher level in the funnel than the surrounding water-bottom or\r\nland-surface, the destruction of the cone might leave a projecting knob\r\nor neck to be surrounded and covered by the accumulating sediments of\r\nthe time. It is thus evident that the levelling of a cone of loose\r\nashes during gradual subsidence, and the deposition of a contemporary\r\nseries of sedimentary deposits, might give rise to a true neck, which\r\nwould be coeval with the geological period of the volcano itself.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is extremely difficult to decide how far any now visible\r\nneck may have been reduced to the condition of a mere stump or core of\r\na volcano before being buried under the stratified accumulations of its\r\ntime. In every case the existence of the neck is a proof of denudation,\r\nand perhaps, in most cases, the chief amount of that denudation is\r\nto be ascribed not to the era of the original volcano, but to the\r\ncomparatively recent interval that has elapsed since, in the progress\r\nof degradation, the volcanic rocks, after being long buried within the\r\ncrust, were once more laid bare by the continuous waste and lowering of\r\nthe level of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. _Stages in the History of old Volcanic Vents_\r\n\r\nLet us now try to follow the successive stages in the history of a\r\nvolcano after its fires had quite burnt out, and when, slowly sinking\r\nin the waters of the sea or lake wherein it had burst forth, it was\r\nburied under an ever-growing accumulation of sedimentary material.\r\nThe sand, mud, calcareous ooze, shell-banks, or whatever may have\r\nbeen the sediment that was gathering there, gradually crept over the\r\nsubmerged cone or neck, and would no doubt be more or less mixed with\r\nany volcanic detritus which waves or currents could stir up. If the\r\ncone escaped being levelled, or if it left a projecting neck, this\r\nsubaqueous feature would be entombed and preserved beneath these\r\ndetrital deposits. Hundreds or thousands of feet of strata might\r\nbe laid down over the site of the volcano, which would then remain\r\nhidden and preserved for an indefinite period, until in the course of\r\ngeological revolutions it might once again be brought to the surface.\r\n\r\nThese successive changes involve no theory or supposition. They must\r\nobviously have taken place again and again in past time. That they\r\nactually did occur is demonstrated by many examples in the British\r\nIsles. I need only refer here to the interesting cases brought to light\r\nby mining operations in the Dairy coal-fields of Ayrshire, which are\r\nmore fully described in Chapter xxvii. (p. 433). In that district a\r\nnumber of cones of tuff, one of which is 700 feet in height, have been\r\nmet with in the course of boring and mining for ironstone and coal.\r\nThe well-known mineral seams of the coal-field can be followed up to\r\nand over these hidden hills of volcanic tuff which in the progress of\r\ndenudation have not yet been laid bare (Fig. 146).\r\n\r\nThe subsidence which carried down the water-bottom and allowed the\r\nvolcanic vents to be entombed in sedimentary deposits may have been in\r\nmost cases tolerably equable, so that at any given point these deposits\r\nwould be sensibly horizontal. But subsequent terrestrial disturbances\r\nmight seriously affect this regularity. The sedimentary formations,\r\npiled above each other to a great depth, and acquiring solidity by\r\ncompression, might be thrown into folds, dislocated, upheaved or\r\ndepressed. The buried volcanic funnels would, of course, share in the\r\neffects of these disturbances, and eventually might be so squeezed\r\nand broken as to be with difficulty recognizable. It is possible\r\nthat some of the extreme stages of such subterranean commotions are\r\nrevealed among the \"Dalradian\" rocks of Scotland. Certain green schists\r\nwhich were evidently originally sediments, and probably tuffs, are\r\nassociated with numerous sills and bosses of eruptive material. The way\r\nin which these various rocks are grouped together strikingly suggests\r\na series of volcanic products, some of the crushed bosses recalling\r\nthe forms of true necks in younger formations. But they have been so\r\nenormously compressed and sheared that the very lavas which originally\r\nwere massive amorphous crystalline rocks have passed into fissile\r\nhornblende-schists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Diagram illustrating the gradual emergence of\r\nburied volcanic cones through the influence of prolonged denudation.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Palæozoic systems of Britain, however, where considerable\r\nfracture and displacement have taken place, examples of successive\r\nstages in the reappearance of buried volcanic cones and necks may be\r\ngathered in abundance. As an illustrative diagram of the process of\r\nrevelation by the gradual denudation of an upheaved tract of country,\r\nFig. 31 may be referred to (compare also Fig. 147).\r\n\r\nHere three volcanic vents are represented in different stages of\r\nre-emergence. In the first (A) we see a cone and funnel which, after\r\nhaving been buried under sedimentary deposits (_s_, _s_,) have been\r\ntilted up by subterranean movements. The overlying strata have been\r\nbrought within the influence of denudation, and their exposed basset\r\nedges along the present surface of the land (_g_, _g_) bear witness\r\nto the loss which they have suffered. Already, in the progress of\r\ndegradation, a portion of the volcanic materials which, ejected from\r\nthat vent, were interstratified with the contemporaneous sediments of\r\nthe surrounding sea-floor, has been exposed at _t_. A geologist coming\r\nto that volcanic intercalation would be sure that it pointed to the\r\nexistence of some volcanic vent in the neighbourhood, but without\r\nfurther evidence he would be unable to tell whether it lay to right or\r\nleft, whether it was now at the surface or lay still buried under cover\r\nof the stratified deposits which were laid down upon it.\r\n\r\nIn the second or central example (B) we have a pipe and cone which have\r\nbeen similarly disturbed. But in this case denudation has proceeded\r\nso far as to reveal the cone and even to cut away a portion of it, as\r\nshown by the dotted lines to the right hand. Owing, however, to the\r\ngeneral inclination of the rocks towards the left, that side of the\r\ncone, together with the tuffs or lavas connected with it, still lies\r\nburied and protected under cover of the sedimentary formations (_s_,\r\n_s_).\r\n\r\nThe third example (C) shows a much more advanced stage of destruction.\r\nHere the whole of the cone has been worn away. All the lavas and tuffs\r\nwhich were ejected from it towards the right have likewise disappeared,\r\nand strata older than the eruptions of this vent now come to the\r\nsurface there. To the left, however, a little portion of its lavas\r\nstill remains at _l_, though all the intervening volcanic material has\r\nbeen removed. That solitary fragment of the outpourings of this volcano\r\nonce extended further to the left hand, but the occurrence of the\r\nlarge dislocation (_f_) has carried this extension for down below the\r\nsurface. The vent in this instance, owing to its position, has suffered\r\nmore from denudation than the other two. Yet, judged by the size of\r\nits neck, it was probably larger than either of them, and threw out a\r\nmore extensive pile of volcanic material. Its funnel has been filled\r\nwith agglomerate (_a_), through which a central plug of lava (_p_) has\r\nascended, and into which dykes or veins (_d_, _d_), the last efforts of\r\neruption, have been injected.\r\n\r\nThis diagram will serve to illustrate the fact already so often\r\ninsisted on, that although denudation may entirely remove a volcanic\r\ncone, and also all the lavas and tuffs which issued from it, the actual\r\nfilled-up pipe cannot be so effaced, but is practically permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Underground Phases of Volcanic Action--_continued_. II.\r\n     Subterranean Movements of the Magma: i. Dykes and Veins; ii.\r\n     Sills and Laccolites; iii. Bosses (Stocks, Culots)--Conditions\r\n     that govern the Intrusion of Molten Rock within the Terrestrial\r\n     Crust.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Subterranean Movements of the Magma\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages attention has been more specially directed to\r\nthose aspects of volcanic energy which reveal themselves above ground\r\nand in eruptive vents. We have now to consider the various ways in\r\nwhich the molten magma is injected into the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nSuch injection must obviously take place during the expulsion of\r\nvolcanic materials to the surface. If the explosive violence of an\r\neruption, or the concomitant movements of the earth's crust, should\r\nlead to ruptures among the subterranean rocks, the molten magma will\r\nbe forced into these rents. It is evident that this may happen either\r\nwith or without any discharge of lava at the surface. It may be either\r\nentirely a plutonic, that is, a deep-seated phenomenon, or it may be\r\npart of a truly volcanic series of events.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, by the study of old volcanoes that have had their\r\nstructure laid bare by denudation, we may hope to obtain fresh light in\r\nregard to some of the more deeply-seated features of volcanic energy,\r\nwhich in a modern volcano are entirely concealed from view. A little\r\nreflection will convince us that the conditions for consolidation\r\nwithin the crust are so different from those at the surface that we may\r\nexpect them to make themselves visible in the internal characters of\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nAn essential distinction between underground propulsions of molten\r\nrock and superficial outflows of the same material lies in the fact\r\nthat while the latter are free to take any shape which the form and\r\nslope of the ground may permit, the subterranean injections, like metal\r\npoured into a mould, are always bounded by the walls of the aperture\r\ninto which they are thrust. According, therefore, to the shape of this\r\naperture a convenient classification of such intrusions may be made.\r\nWhere the molten material has risen up vertical fissures or irregular\r\ncracks, it has solidified as Dykes and Veins. Where it has been thrust\r\nbetween the divisional planes either of stratified or unstratified\r\nrocks, so as to form beds, these are conveniently known as Sills,\r\nLaccolites or Intrusive Sheets. Where it has taken the form of large\r\ncylindrical masses, which, ascending through the crust, appear at the\r\nsurface in rounded, elliptical or irregularly-shaped eminences, these\r\nare called Bosses (Stocks, Culots).\r\n\r\nFurther contrasts between the superficial and subterranean\r\nconsolidation of molten material are to be found in the respective\r\ntextures and minute structures of the rocks. The deep-seated intrusions\r\nare commonly characterized by a general and markedly greater coarseness\r\nof crystallization than is possessed by lavas poured out at the\r\nsurface. This difference of texture, obviously in great measure the\r\nresult of slower cooling, shows itself in acid, intermediate, and basic\r\nmagmas. A lava which at the surface has cooled as a fine-grained,\r\ncompact black basalt, in which neither with the naked eye nor with\r\nthe lens can the constituent minerals be distinctly determined, may\r\nconceivably be represented at the roots of its parent volcano by a\r\ncoarse-textured gabbro, in which the felspars and pyroxenes may have\r\ngrown into crystals or crystalline aggregates an inch or more in\r\nlength. Mr. Iddings has pointed out that the various porphyrites which\r\nform the dykes and sills of Electric Peak are connected with a central\r\nboss of coarsely crystalline diorite.[29] Examples of the same relation\r\nfrom different volcanic centres in Britain will be cited in later\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _12th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1890-91), p. 595.]\r\n\r\nThis greater coarseness of texture is shown by microscopic examination\r\nto be accompanied by other notable differences. In particular, the\r\nglassy residuum, or its devitrified representatives, which may be so\r\nfrequently detected among the crystals of outflowing lavas, is less\r\noften traceable in the body of subterranean intrusive rocks, though it\r\nmay sometimes be noticed at their outer margins where they have been\r\nrapidly chilled by contact with the cool upper part of the crust into\r\nwhich they have been impelled. Various minerals, the constituents of\r\nwhich exist in the original magma, but which may be hardly or not all\r\nrecognisable in the superficial lavas, have had leisure to crystallize\r\nout in the deep-seated intrusions and appear sometimes among the\r\ncomponents of the general body of the rock, or as well-terminated\r\ncrystals in its drusy cavities.\r\n\r\nConsiderable though the variations may be between the petrographical\r\ncharacters of the intrusive and extrusive rocks of a given district\r\nand of the same eruptive period, they appear generally to lie within\r\nsuch limits as to suggest a genetic relation between the whole series.\r\nConditions of temperature and pressure, and the retention or escape of\r\nthe absorbed vapours which play so large a part in volcanic activity,\r\nmust exercise great influence on the crystallization of constituent\r\nminerals, and on the consolidation and ultimate texture of the rocks.\r\nSlow cooling under great pressure and with the mineralizing vapours\r\nstill largely retained seems to be pre-eminently favourable for the\r\nproduction of a holocrystalline texture in deep-seated portions of the\r\nmagma, while rapid cooling under merely atmospheric pressure and with\r\na continuous disengagement of vapours, appears to be required for the\r\nfiner grain, more glassy structure, and more vesicular character of\r\nlavas poured out at the surface.\r\n\r\nBesides these differences, however, there is evidence of a migration\r\nof the constituent minerals in the body of large intrusive masses\r\nbefore consolidation. In particular, the heavier and more basic\r\nconstituents travel towards the cooling margin, leaving the central\r\nportions more acid. This subject will be more fully considered in\r\nconnection with the internal constitution of Bosses, and some British\r\nexamples will then be cited.\r\n\r\nReference, however, may here be made to one of the most exhaustive\r\nand instructive studies of the relations of the subterranean and\r\nsuperficial erupted rocks of an old volcano, which will be found in the\r\nmonograph by Mr. Iddings on Electric Peak and Sepulchre Mountain in the\r\nYellowstone Park of Western America. From the data there obtainable he\r\ndraws the deduction that one parent magma, retaining the same chemical\r\ncomposition, may result in the ultimate production of rocks strikingly\r\ndifferent from each other in structure and mineralogical constitution,\r\nyet chemically identical. Electric Peak includes the central funnel\r\nfilled up with coarsely crystalline diorite, and having a connected\r\nseries of sills and dykes of various porphyrites. Sepulchre Mountain,\r\nseparated from its neighbouring eminence by a fault of 4000 feet,\r\ndisplays some of the superficial discharges from the vent--coarse\r\nbreccias with andesite-lavas. These rocks are not chemically\r\ndistinguishable from the intrusive series, but the lavas are, on the\r\nwhole, more glassy, while the materials of the bosses, sills and dykes\r\nare more crystalline. The latter display much more visible quartz and\r\nbiotite.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _12th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_, 1890-91. As already\r\nstated, the eruptions of this volcanic centre became progressively more\r\nacid, and this change appears to be exhibited by the extrusive lavas as\r\nwell as by the intrusive rocks.]\r\n\r\nBy practice in the field, supplemented by investigation with the aid\r\nof the microscope, a geologist acquires a power of discriminating\r\nwith fair accuracy, even in hand specimens, the superficial from the\r\nsubterranean igneous rocks of an old volcanic district.\r\n\r\nDenudation, while laying bare the underground mechanism of an ancient\r\nvolcano, has not always revealed the evidence of the actual structural\r\nrelations of the rocks, or has first exposed and then destroyed it.\r\nSometimes a mass of eruptive rock has been worn down and left in such\r\nan isolated condition that its connection with the rest of the volcanic\r\nnetwork cannot be determined. So far as its position goes, it might\r\nperhaps be either a remnant of a lava-stream or the projecting part of\r\nsome deeper-seated protrusion. But its texture and internal structure\r\nwill often enable a confident opinion to be expressed regarding the\r\ntrue relations of such a solitary mass.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Dykes and Veins_\r\n\r\nFor the study of these manifestations of volcanic energy, the British\r\nIsles may be regarded as a typical region. It was thence that the word\r\n\"dyke\" passed into geological literature. Thousands of examples of both\r\ndykes and veins may be seen from the Outer Hebrides southwards across\r\nthe length and breadth of the southern half of Scotland, far into the\r\nnorth of England and towards the centre of Ireland. They may be found\r\ncutting the crests of the mountains and extending as reefs below the\r\nlevel of the sea. They are thus exposed in every conceivable divergence\r\nof position and in endless varieties of enclosing rock. Moreover, they\r\ncan be shown to represent a vast range of geological time. One system\r\nof them belongs to some remote part of the Archæan periods, another is\r\nas young as the older Tertiary ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Dyke, Vein and Sill.\r\n\r\nThe dyke (_d_) rises along a small fault among sandstones, shales, and\r\nironstones (_sh_), and gives off a vein (_v_) and an intrusive sheet or\r\nsill (_b_).]\r\n\r\nFull details regarding these interesting relics of volcanic activity\r\nwill be given in later chapters, especially in Chapters xxxiv. and\r\nxxxv. It may suffice here to note that each of the three types of\r\nold volcanoes above described has, in Britain, its accompaniment\r\nof dykes and veins. The plateaux, however, present by far the most\r\nabundant and varied development of them. The dykes of this series are\r\ncharacterized not only by their prodigious numbers in and around some\r\nof the plateaux, but by the long distances to which they may be traced\r\nbeyond these limits. They are chiefly found in connection with the\r\nTertiary basalt-plateaux, though the Carboniferous andesite-plateaux\r\npresent a feebler display of them. The Tertiary dykes are pre-eminently\r\ndistinguished by their persistent rectilinear lines, sometimes for\r\ndistances of many miles, and their general north-westerly direction.\r\nThey form a vast system extending over an area of some 40,000 square\r\nmiles. Throughout that wide region their persistence of direction and\r\nof petrographical characters point to the former existence of one or\r\nmore reservoirs of an andesitic and basaltic magma underneath the\r\nnorthern half of Britain, and to the rupture of the crust overlying\r\nthis subterranean reservoir by thousands of parallel fissures. They\r\nthus constitute perhaps the most astonishing feature in the volcanic\r\nhistory of Tertiary time.\r\n\r\nThe dykes and veins connected with the puys are mainly to be found at\r\nor close to the vents. Not infrequently they traverse the agglomerates\r\nof the necks, and are sometimes to be traced to a central pipe or core\r\nof basalt.\r\n\r\nThe larger cones are likewise intersected with similar vertical,\r\ninclined or tortuously irregular walls of intruded lava. Occasionally\r\na radiate arrangement may be observed in such cases, like that\r\nnoticeable at some modern volcanoes, the dykes diverging from the\r\neruptive centre.\r\n\r\nMany dykes exist regarding which there is no evidence to connect them\r\nwith any actual volcanic rocks. They have been injected into fissures,\r\nbut whether this took place during volcanic paroxysms, or owing to some\r\nsubterranean movements which never culminated in any eruption, cannot\r\nbe decided.\r\n\r\nThe question of the age of dykes, like that of intrusive masses of\r\nall kinds, is often difficult or impossible to decide. A dyke must of\r\ncourse be younger than the rocks which it traverses, and a limit to\r\nits antiquity is thus easily fixed. But we cannot always affirm that\r\nbecause a dyke stops short of a particular rock, or series of rocks,\r\nit is older than these. The Hett Dyke, in the north of England, rises\r\nthrough the Coal-measures, but stops at the Magnesian Limestone; yet\r\nthis cessation does not necessarily imply that the dyke was in place\r\nbefore the deposition of that limestone. The structure may have arisen\r\nfrom the dyke-fissure having ended at the bottom of the limestone.\r\nWhere dykes rise up to the base of an unconformable formation without\r\nin any single case entering it, and where fragments of them are\r\nenclosed in that formation, they must be of higher antiquity, and must\r\nhave been laid bare by extensive denudation before the unconformable\r\nstrata were deposited upon them. The great system of dykes in the\r\nLewisian Gneiss of the north-west of Scotland is in this way proved to\r\nbe much more ancient than the Torridon Sandstones under which it passes\r\n(Figs. 35, 36).\r\n\r\nWhere two dykes cross each other, it is sometimes not difficult\r\nto decide upon their relative antiquity. In intrusive rocks, the\r\nfinest-grained parts are those which lie nearest the outer margin,\r\nwhere the molten material was rapidly chilled by coming in contact\r\nwith cool surfaces of rock. Such \"chilled margins\" of closer grain are\r\ncommon characteristics of dykes. Wherever a dyke carries its chilled\r\nmargin across another dyke, it must be the younger of the two, and\r\nwherever such a margin is interrupted by another dyke, it must belong\r\nto the older.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the uprise of molten material in a fissure has so\r\neffectually sealed it up that in the subsequent disturbances of the\r\nterrestrial crust the fissure has not been reopened, though others\r\nmay have been produced near it, or across it. Sometimes, however, the\r\nenormous tension to which the crust was exposed opened the fissure\r\nonce more, sometimes even splitting a dyke along its centre, and a\r\nnew ascent of molten rock took place within the rent. Hence double\r\nor treble or compound dykes have been produced. The second or later\r\ninfillings are generally somewhat different from the original dyke.\r\nOccasionally, indeed, they present a strong contrast to it. Thus,\r\namong the dykes of Skye examples occur where the centre is occupied by\r\nan acid granophyre, while the sides are occupied by dykes of basalt.\r\nInstances of this compound type of dyke will be given in the account of\r\nthe Tertiary volcanic rocks of Britain.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in a wide fissure the central portion may remain\r\nmolten for some time after the sides have consolidated. If the fissure\r\nserved as a channel for the ascent of lava to the surface, it is\r\nconceivable that the central still fluid part might be driven out and\r\nbe replaced by other material from below, and that this later material\r\nmight differ considerably in composition from that which first filled\r\nthe opening. Such, according to Mr. Iddings, has been the probable\r\nhistory of some of the dykes at the old volcano of Electric Peak.[31]\r\nBut we can hardly suppose that this explanation of compound dykes can\r\nhave any wide application. It could only hold good of broad fissures\r\nhaving an outlet, and is probably inadmissible in the case of the\r\nnumerous compound dykes not more than 10 or 15 feet in diameter, where\r\nthe several bands of rock are sharply marked off from each other.\r\nThe abrupt demarcation of the materials in these dykes, their closer\r\ntexture along their mutual boundaries, the indications of solution\r\nof the older parts of the group by the younger, and of injection of\r\nthe latter into the former, show that they belong to separate and\r\nunconnected intrusions. These questions will be again referred to in\r\nthe account of the British Tertiary dykes (Chapter xxxv. vol. ii. p.\r\n159).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _12th Ann. Rep. U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1890-91), p. 587.]\r\n\r\nAnother kind of compound dyke has arisen from the manner in which the\r\noriginal fissure has been produced. While, in general, the dislocation\r\nhas taken the form of a single rectilinear rent, which on opening has\r\nleft two clean-cut walls, cases occur where the rupture has followed\r\nseveral parallel lines, and the magma on rising into the rents appears\r\nas two or more vertical sheets or dykes, separated by intervening\r\npartitions of the surrounding rock. Examples of this structure are\r\nnot infrequent among the Tertiary dykes of Scotland. One of these may\r\nbe noticed rising through the cliffs of Lewisian gneiss on the east\r\ncoast of the island of Lewis, south of Stornoway. One of the most\r\nextraordinary instances of the same structure yet observed is that\r\ndescribed by Professor A. C. Lawson from the Laurentian rocks at the\r\nmouth of White Gravel River, on the N.E. coast of Lake Superior. In\r\na breadth of only about 14 feet no less than 28 vertically intrusive\r\nsheets or dykes of diabase, from 1 inch to 6½ inches broad, rise\r\nthrough the granite, which is thus split into 27 thin sheets. The\r\ndiabase undoubtedly cuts the granite, some of the sheets actually\r\nanastomosing and sending veins into the older rock.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _American Geologist_ (1894), p. 293.]\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence supplied by the modern eruptions of Iceland, it is\r\nevident that gaping fissures, which are filled by ascending lava and\r\nthereby converted into dykes, in many instances serve as channels by\r\nwhich molten rock escapes to the surface. It would be interesting if\r\nany test could be discovered whereby those dykes could be distinguished\r\nwhich had ever established a connection with the outer air. If the lava\r\ncontinued to ascend in the fissures, and to pour out in superficial\r\nstreams for a long time, the rocks on either side would be likely\r\nto undergo considerably more metamorphism than where there was only\r\none rapid injection of the magma, which would soon cool. Possibly in\r\nthe much greater alteration of the same rocks by some dykes than by\r\nothers, a sign of such a connection with the surface may survive. This\r\nsubject will be again referred to in the account of the Tertiary dykes\r\nof Britain in Book VIII., where the whole of the phenomena of this\r\nphase of volcanic action will be fully discussed (see vol. ii. p. 163).\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Sills and Laccolites_\r\n\r\nThe word \"sill,\" derived from a remarkable sheet of eruptive rock in\r\nthe north of England, known as the Great Whin Sill (Chapter xxix.),\r\nis now applied as a convenient general term to masses of intrusive\r\nmaterial, which have been injected between such divisional planes as\r\nthose of stratification, and which now appear as sheets or beds (Fig.\r\n33). These masses are likewise called Intrusive Sheets, and where the\r\ninjected material has accumulated in large blister-like expansions,\r\nthese are known as Laccolites (Fig. 34).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Section of Sill or Intrusive Sheet.]\r\n\r\nSills vary from only an inch or two up to 500 feet or more in\r\nthickness. Lying, as they frequently do, parallel with strata above and\r\nbelow them, they resemble in some respects true lava-sheets erupted\r\ncontemporaneously with the series of sediments among which they are\r\nintercalated. And, indeed, cases occur in which it is hardly possible\r\nto decide whether to regard a given mass as a sill or as a superficial\r\nlava. In general, however, sills exhibit the coarser texture above\r\nreferred to as specially characteristic of subterranean eruptive\r\nmasses. Moreover they are usually, though not always, free from the\r\nvesicular and amygdaloidal structures of true surface-lavas. Their\r\nunder and upper surfaces, unlike the more scoriaceous parts of lavas,\r\nare commonly much closer in grain than the general body of the mass;\r\nin other words, they possess chilled borders, the result of more rapid\r\nconsolidation by contact with cooler rock. Again, instead of conforming\r\nto the stratification of the formations among which they lie, as truly\r\ninterstratified lavas do, they may be seen to break across the bedding\r\nand pursue their course on a higher or lower platform. The strata that\r\noverlie them, instead of enclosing pieces of them and wrapping round\r\nirregularities on their surface, as in the case of contemporaneously\r\nerupted lava-sheets, are usually indurated, sometimes even considerably\r\naltered, while in many cases they are invaded by veins from the\r\neruptive sheet, or portions of them are involved in it, and are then\r\nmuch hardened or metamorphosed.\r\n\r\nThe petrographical character of the sills in a volcanic district\r\ndepends primarily on the constitution of the parent magma, whence\r\nboth they and the outflowing lavas have issued. Where the lavas are\r\nrhyolites or felsites the sills are acid, where basalts have been\r\nerupted the sills are basic, though there has often been a tendency\r\ntowards the appearance of more acid material, such as trachyte. As\r\nwe have seen, considerable differences in petrographical characters\r\nmay arise between the intrusive and extrusive offshoots from the same\r\nparent magma during the course of a volcanic cycle. This question will\r\nbe more appropriately discussed together with the leading characters of\r\nBosses.\r\n\r\nBetween the upper and under surface of a thick sill considerable\r\npetrographical variation may sometimes be observed, especially where\r\nthe rock is of basic constitution. Differences both of texture and even\r\nto some extent of composition can be detected. Sometimes what have\r\nbeen called \"segregation veins\" traverse the mass, consisting of the\r\nsame minerals as the general body of the rock, but in larger crystals\r\nand in somewhat different proportions. That these veins belong to the\r\nperiod of original consolidation appears to be shown by the absence of\r\nfine-grained, chilled margins, and by the way in which the component\r\ncrystals of the veins are interlocked with those of the body of the\r\nrock. Other veins of finer grain and more acid composition probably\r\nbelong to a later phase of consolidation, when, after the separation\r\nand crystallization of the more basic minerals, the more acid mother\r\nliquor that remained was, in consequence of terrestrial movements,\r\ninjected into cracks in the now solidified, though still highly heated,\r\nrock. Examples of these features will be cited from various geological\r\nformations in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the difference occasionally\r\nperceptible between the constitution of the upper and that of the\r\nunder portions of superficial lavas. A similar variation is sometimes\r\nstrongly marked among sills, especially those of a basic character,\r\nthe felspars remaining most abundant above, while the olivines and\r\naugites preponderate below. Mr. Iddings has observed some excellent\r\nillustrations of this character in the great series of sills connected\r\nwith the volcanic pipe of Electric Peak in the Yellowstone country.[33]\r\nSome examples of the same structure will subsequently be cited from the\r\nCarboniferous volcanic series of Central Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: \"Electric Peak and Sepulchre Mountain,\" _12th Ann. Rep.\r\nU.S. Geol. Survey_ (1890-91), p. 584.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest extreme of difference which I have observed in the\r\npetrographical characters of any group of sills is that displayed by\r\nthe Tertiary gabbros of Skye. These rocks occur as sheets interposed\r\namong the bedded basalts, and injected between each other in such\r\na manner as to form thick piles of rudely stratified sills. They\r\npossess a remarkable banded structure, due to the aggregation of their\r\ncomponent minerals in distinct layers, some of which are dark in\r\ncolour, from the abundance of their iron-ore, pyroxene and olivine;\r\nwhile others are light-coloured, from the predominance of their\r\nfelspar. From the manner in which the component minerals of one band\r\ninterlace with those of the contiguous bands, it is quite certain that\r\nthe structure is not due to successive injections of material among\r\nalready consolidated rocks, but belongs to the original conditions\r\nof expulsion of the gabbro as a whole. It seems to indicate that\r\nthe magma which supplied the sills was at the time of its extrusion\r\nheterogeneous in composition, and that the banding arises from the\r\nsimultaneous or rapidly successive protrusion of different portions of\r\nthis variously-constituted magma. The details of the structure will be\r\ndescribed in the general account to be given of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nrocks (Chapters xliii. and xliv.).\r\n\r\nBesides such visible differences in the composition of sills, others\r\nmuch less obtrusive may occasionally be detected with the aid of\r\nmicroscopic or chemical research. The outer parts of some sills are\r\nthus discovered to be more basic or more acid than the inner portions.\r\nOr evidence may be obtained pointing to the probable melting down of\r\nsurrounding rocks by the erupted magma, with a consequent local change\r\nin the chemical and mineralogical constitution of the mass.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their position in the geological structure of an old\r\nvolcanic district I may here remark that sills, seldom entirely absent,\r\nare more especially developed either among the rocks through which the\r\nvolcano has driven its vent, or about the base of the erupted lavas\r\nand tuffs. Many illustrations of this distribution will be described\r\nfrom the various volcanic areas of Britain belonging to Palæozoic and\r\nTertiary time. At the base of the great Cambrian and Lower Silurian\r\nvolcanic series of Merionethshire, sills are admirably developed, while\r\namong the basaltic eruptions which closed the long volcanic record in\r\nthe north of Ireland and the Inner Hebrides, they play a notable part.\r\n\r\nFrom the frequent place which sills take at the base of a volcanic\r\nseries, it may be inferred that they generally belong to a late phase\r\nin the history of an eruptive episode or cycle, when the orifices of\r\ndischarge had become choked up, and when the volcanic energy found an\r\neasier passage laterally between the strata underneath the volcanic\r\npile or between the sheets of that pile itself, than upward through the\r\never-increasing thickness of ejected material.\r\n\r\nWhile there is an obvious relation between most sills and some eruptive\r\ncentre in their neighbourhood, cases occur in which no trace of any\r\ncontemporaneous volcano can be found, but where the intrusive sheet\r\nremains as the sole evidence of the movements of the subterranean\r\nmagma. The Great Whin Sill, one of the most extensive intrusive sheets\r\nin the British Isles, is an instance of this kind. Though this large\r\nmass of injected material can be traced for a distance of about 80\r\nmiles, and though the strata beneath and above it are well exposed in\r\ninnumerable sections, no evidence has yet been detected to show that\r\nit was connected with any vent that formed a volcano at the surface\r\n(see vol. ii. p. 2). The absence of this evidence may, of course,\r\narise from the failure of denudation to uncover the site of the vent,\r\nwhich may possibly still remain buried under the Carboniferous strata\r\nthat overlie the sill towards the south-east. But it may be due to the\r\nnon-existence of any such vent. We can quite conceive that volcanic\r\nenergy should sometimes have failed to complete the formation of\r\nan actual volcano. Aided by subterranean movements, it might have\r\nbeen potent enough to disrupt the lower parts of the terrestrial\r\ncrust, to propel the molten magma into fissures, even to inject it\r\nfor many miles between the planes of stratification, which would be\r\nlines of least resistance, and yet in default of available rents,\r\nmight have been unable to force its way through the upper layers and\r\nso reach the surface. Examples of such incompleted volcanoes are\r\nperhaps to be recognized among solitary sills, which not infrequently\r\npresent themselves in the geological structure of Britain. But the\r\npositive decision of this question is almost always frustrated by the\r\nimperfection of the evidence, and the consequent possibility that a\r\nconnected vent may still lie concealed under overlying strata.\r\n\r\nBesides the more usual intrusions of molten material in the form of\r\nsheets of which the vertical thickness bears but a small proportion\r\nto the horizontal extent, there occur also large and thick cakes of\r\nintruded material in which the vertical thickness may approach, or\r\nperhaps even surpass, the horizontal diameter. These dome-shaped or\r\nirregular expansions form a connecting link between ordinary sills and\r\nthe bosses to be subsequently described. They have received the name of\r\n_Laccolites_ from Mr. G. K. Gilbert, who worked out this peculiar type\r\nof structure in the case of the Henry Mountains in southern Utah[34]\r\n(Fig. 34). The same type has since been found distributed over Arizona\r\nand Colorado, and it has been recognized as essentially that of many\r\neruptive masses or bosses in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: \"Geology of the Henry Mountains,\" _U.S. Geog. and Geol.\r\nSurvey of the Rocky Mountain Region_, 1877. For a review of the\r\nwhole subject of laccolites in Western America see a paper by Mr.\r\nWhitman Cross, in the _14th Annual Report of the Director of the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey_, 1892-93 (pub. 1895), p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Ideal section of three Laccolites. (After Mr.\r\nGilbert.)]\r\n\r\nIn Western America, owing in large measure to the previously\r\nundisturbed condition of the sedimentary formations, the relations of\r\nthe injected igneous material to these formations can be satisfactorily\r\nascertained. The geological structure of the various isolated\r\nlaccolites thus clearly presented, helps to explain the structure of\r\nother intrusive bodies which, having been injected among plicated and\r\ndislocated rocks, do not so readily admit of interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, Utah and Arizona the eruptive magma, usually a porphyrite,\r\ndiorite or quartz-porphyry, has risen in one or more pipes, and has\r\nthen intruded itself laterally between the planes of the sedimentary\r\nformations which, over the centre of intrusion, have been pushed upward\r\ninto a vast dome-shaped or blister-like elevation. The horizon on which\r\nthis lateral and vertical expansion of the intruded material took\r\nplace would seem to have lain several thousand feet below the surface.\r\nIt ranges from the Cambrian to the Tertiary formations. Subsequent\r\ndenudation has cut down the upraised mantle of sedimentary layers, and\r\nhas revealed more or less of the igneous rock underneath, which is\r\nthus allowed to protrude and to be affected by atmospheric erosion.\r\nIn this way, wide plains of horizontal or gently undulating Secondary\r\nand Tertiary strata have been diversified by the appearance of cones,\r\ndetached or in groups, which have become more peaked and varied in\r\noutline in proportion as their original sedimentary covering has been\r\nremoved from them. The largest of the laccolitic masses in the Henry\r\nMountains is about 7000 feet deep and about 4 miles in diameter. Less\r\nthan one-half of the cover of overarching strata has been removed, and\r\ndenudation has cut deeply into the remaining part.\r\n\r\nThat the type of structure, so well exhibited among the Henry\r\nMountains, has not been more abundantly recognized elsewhere probably\r\narises from the fact not that it is rare, but that the conditions\r\nfor its development are seldom so favourable as in Western America.\r\nObviously where stratified rocks have been much disturbed, they cease\r\nto furnish definite or regular platforms for the reception of eruptive\r\nmaterial, and to afford convenient datum-lines for estimating what\r\nwas probably the shape of the intruded magma. We may believe that the\r\neffect of the propulsion of eruptive material is usually to upheave\r\nthe overlying crust, and thus to give rise to a laccolitic form of\r\nintrusion. The upheaval relatively to the surrounding country will\r\nbe apt to be practically permanent, the intruded body of rock being\r\nwelded to the surrounding formations, and forming in this way a solid\r\nand resisting core directly united by pipes or funnels with the great\r\nmagma-reservoir underneath. On the other hand, where the molten rock,\r\ninstead of consolidating underground, has been copiously discharged at\r\nthe surface, its emission must tend towards the production of cavernous\r\nspaces within the crust. The falling in of the roofs of such caverns\r\nwill give rise to shocks of earthquakes. Subsequent uprisings of the\r\nmagma may fill these spaces up, and when the rock has solidified in the\r\nform of laccolites or bosses, it may effectually put an end there to\r\nfurther eruptions.\r\n\r\nSome contact metamorphism may be observed along the upper and under\r\nsurfaces of large sills. The rocks over the American laccolites have\r\nsometimes been highly altered. But as the change is the same in kind as\r\nthat attendant upon Bosses, though generally less in degree, it will\r\nbe considered with these intrusive masses. The problems in terrestrial\r\nphysics suggested by the intrusion of such thick and persistent\r\nmasses of eruptive material as those which form sills and laccolites\r\nwill likewise be discussed in connection with the mechanism of the\r\nremaining intrusive masses which have now to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Bosses (Stocks, Culots)_\r\n\r\nThe term Boss has been applied to masses of intrusive rock which form\r\nat the surface rounded, craggy or variously-shaped eminences, having a\r\ncircular, elliptical or irregular ground-plan, and descending into the\r\nterrestrial crust with vertical or steeply-inclined sides (Fig. 28).\r\nSometimes they can be seen to have pushed the surrounding rocks aside.\r\nIn other places they seem to occupy the place of these rocks through\r\nwhich, as it were, an opening has been punched for the reception of the\r\nintrusive material.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, more especially in the case of large bosses, like\r\nthose in which granite so frequently appears, the eruptive mass may\r\nbe observed to rise here and there in detached knobs through the\r\nsurrounding rocks, or to enclose patches of these, in such a manner as\r\nto indicate that the large body of eruptive material terminates upward\r\nin a very irregular surface, of which only the more prominent parts\r\nproject through the cake of overlying rocks. In true bosses, unlike\r\nsills or laccolites, we do not get to any bottom on which the eruptive\r\nmaterial rests. Laccolites, indeed, may be regarded as intermediate\r\nbetween the typical sill and the typical boss. The difference between\r\na laccolite and a boss lies in the fact that the body of the laccolite\r\ndoes not descend into an unknown depth in the crust, but lies upon a\r\nplatform on which it has accumulated, the magma having ascended by one\r\nor more ducts, which generally bear but a small proportion in area to\r\nthe mass of the laccolite. The boss, on the other hand, is not known\r\nto lie on any horizon, nor to proceed from smaller ducts underneath,\r\nbut plunges as a great pillar or irregular mass, which may frequently\r\nbe noticed to widen downwards into the crust. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that many masses of eruptive rock, which, according to the\r\ndefinition here given, should be called bosses, would be found to be\r\ntruly laccolites if their structure below ground could be ascertained.\r\nIt is obvious that our failure to find any platform on which the body\r\nof a boss lies, may arise merely from denudation having been as yet\r\ninsufficient to lay such a platform bare. It is hardly probable that\r\na boss several miles in diameter should descend as a column of that\r\nmagnitude to the magma-reservoir from which its material came. More\r\nprobably it has been supplied through one or more smaller ducts. The\r\nlarge boss now visible at the surface may thus be really a laccolitic\r\nexpansion on one or more horizons. M. Michel Lévy lays stress on the\r\ngeneral widening of granitic bosses as they descend into the crust.[35]\r\nWhile his observations are supported by many illustrations from all\r\nparts of the globe, and are probably true of the deeper-seated masses\r\nof granite, it is no less true that numerous examples have been met\r\nwith where a granite boss is sharply marked off from the rocks which it\r\nhas invaded and on which it may be seen to lie. Apart from the cases\r\nwhere granite seems to form part of a vast internal, once molten mass,\r\ninto which its encircling gneisses seem to graduate, there are others\r\nin which this rock, as now visible, has been injected into the crust as\r\na boss or as a laccolite. Instances will be described in later chapters\r\nwhere such bosses have risen through Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous formations. It may be said that between such granitic\r\nintrusions and volcanic operations no connection can be traced. But\r\nreasons will be brought forward in later chapters to regard some of\r\nthe granitic bosses as parts of the mechanism of Palæozoic volcanoes.\r\nIt will also be shown that among the intrusive rocks of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic series of Britain there occur bosses of truly granophyric and\r\ngranitic material. Hence, though mainly what is called a \"plutonic\"\r\nrock, granite has made its appearance among the subterranean\r\nprotrusions of volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: M. Michel Lévy, _Bull. Carte Géol. France_, No. 35, tome\r\nv. (1893), p. 32. The view stated in the text is also that adopted\r\nby Prof. Brögger with reference to the granite of the Christiania\r\ndistrict. \"Die Eruptivgesteine des Kristianiagebietes.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that many intrusive masses, which must be included\r\nunder the general name of bosses, have probably had no connection\r\nwhatever with volcanic action properly so called. They are plutonic\r\ninjections, that is, portions of the subterranean magma which have been\r\nintruded into the terrestrial crust during its periods of disturbance,\r\nand have not been accompanied with any superficial discharges, which\r\nare essential in truly volcanic energy. It has been proposed to draw\r\na distinction between such deep-seated intrusions and those which\r\nrepresent volcanic funnels.[36] If this were always practicable it\r\nwould certainly be desirable. But the distinction is not one that can\r\nin every case be satisfactorily drawn. Even in regard to granitic\r\nbosses, which may generally be assumed to be plutonic in origin, the\r\nBritish examples just referred to have in all likelihood been connected\r\nwith undoubted volcanic outbursts. Without, therefore, attempting here\r\nto separate the obviously volcanic necks of eruptive material from the\r\nprobably plutonic bosses, I propose to describe briefly the general\r\ncharacters of bosses considered as a group of intrusive rocks, together\r\nwith the phenomena which accompany them, and the conditions under which\r\nthey may have been injected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: M. Michel Lévy, _Bull. Carte Géol. France_, No. 35, tome\r\nv. (1893).]\r\n\r\nBosses, whether of plutonic or volcanic origin, are frequently not\r\nmerely single masses of eruptive rock, but are accompanied with a\r\nsystem of dykes and veins, some of which can be traced directly into\r\nthe parent-mass, while others traverse it as well as the surrounding\r\nrocks. Hence the history of a boss may be considerably more complex\r\nthan the external form of the mass might suggest.\r\n\r\nThe petrographical characters of bosses link them with the other\r\nunderground injections of igneous material, more especially with sills\r\nand laccolites. Indeed, on mere lithological grounds no satisfactory\r\nline could be drawn between these various forms of intrusive rocks. The\r\nlarger the mass the more coarsely crystalline it may be expected to be.\r\nBut the whole range of structure, texture and composition, from those\r\nof the narrowest vein to those of the widest boss, constitutes one\r\nconnected series of gradations.\r\n\r\nAcid, intermediate and basic rocks are abundantly displayed among the\r\nbosses. Huge masses of granite, granophyre, quartz-porphyry, felsite or\r\nrhyolite, represent the acid series. Intermediate varieties consist of\r\ntrachyte, phonolite, diorite, andesite or other rock. The basic bosses\r\ninclude varieties of gabbro, dolerite, basalt, picrite, and other\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nIn a boss of large size, a considerable range of texture, composition\r\nand structure may often be observed. The rock is generally much\r\ncoarser in grain than that of thin sills or dykes. Sometimes it\r\nexhibits a finer texture along the margin than in the centre, though\r\nthis variation is not usually so marked as in sills and dykes. The\r\nrapidly-chilled and therefore more close-textured selvage seems to\r\nhave been developed much more fully in small than in large masses of\r\neruptive material. The latter, cooling more slowly, allowed even their\r\nmarginal parts to retain their heat, and sometimes perhaps even their\r\nmolten condition, longer than small injections. Some influence must\r\nalso have been exercised by the temperature of the rocks into which the\r\neruptive material was intruded. Where this temperature was high, as\r\nin deep-seated parts of the crust, it would allow the intrusive magma\r\nto cool more slowly, and thus to assume a more coarsely crystalline\r\ncondition. The absence of a close grain round the margins of granitic\r\nbosses may be due to this cause.\r\n\r\nBut a much more important distinction may be traced between the central\r\nand marginal parts of some large bosses and thick sills. I have already\r\nalluded to the fact that while the middle of a large intrusive mass\r\nmay be decidedly acid, taking even the form of granite, the outer\r\nborders are sometimes found to be much more basic, passing into such a\r\nrock as gabbro, or even into some ultra-basic compound. Between these\r\nextremes of composition no sharp division is sometimes discoverable,\r\nsuch as might have been expected had the one rock been intruded into\r\nthe other. The differences graduate so insensibly into each other\r\nas to suggest that originally the whole mass of the rock formed one\r\ncontinuous body of eruptive material. It is possible that in some cases\r\nthe magma itself was heterogeneous at the time of intrusion.[37] But\r\nthe frequency of the distribution of the basic ingredients towards\r\nthe outer margin, and the acid towards the centre, points rather to a\r\nprocess of differentiation among the constituents of the boss before\r\nconsolidation. In some instances the differentiation would appear to\r\nhave taken place before crystallization to any great extent had set in,\r\nbecause the minerals ultimately developed in the central parts differ\r\nfrom those at the sides. In other cases, the transference of material\r\nwould seem to have been in progress after the component minerals had\r\ncrystallized out of the magma, for they are the same throughout the\r\nwhole intrusive mass, but differ in relative proportions from centre to\r\ncircumference.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: The Tertiary gabbros of the Inner Hebrides have already\r\nbeen cited, and will be more fully described in a later chapter as\r\nexhibiting the heterogeneousness of an eruptive magma.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See Messrs. Dakyns and Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nxlviii. (1892), p. 104; Prof. Brögger, _op. cit._ 1. (1894), p. 15; Mr.\r\nA. Harker, _op. cit._ p. 320; Prof. Iddings, _Journ. Geol. Chicago_,\r\ni. (1893), p. 833; _Bull. Phil. Soc. Washington_, ii. (1890), p. 191;\r\n1892, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nAs illustrations of these features I may cite two good examples, one\r\nfrom Scotland and one from England. The mass of Garabol Hill, in the\r\nLoch Lomond district, consists mainly of granite, occupying an area\r\nof about 12½ square miles. Messrs. Dakyns and Teall have shown that\r\nwhile the central portions consist of granite, the south-eastern\r\nmargin affords a remarkable series of intermediate rocks, such as\r\nhornblende-biotite-granite, tonalite (quartz-mica-diorite), diorite and\r\naugite-diorite, which lead us outwards into highly basic compounds,\r\nincluding wehrlites (olivine-diallage rocks), picrites (olivine-augite\r\nrocks), serpentine (possibly representing dunites, saxonites, and\r\nlherzolites), and a peculiar rock consisting essentially of enstatite,\r\ndiallage, brown hornblende and biotite. The authors regard the whole\r\nof these widely different rocks as the products of one original magma,\r\nthe more basic marginal area having consolidated first as peridotites,\r\nfollowed by diorites, tonalites and granites in the order of increasing\r\nacidity. The most acid rock in the whole series consists of felspar\r\nand quartz, is almost devoid of ferro-magnesian minerals, and occurs\r\nin narrow veins in the granite and tonalite. It indicates that after\r\nthe segregation and consolidation of the whole boss, ruptures occurred\r\nwhich were filled in by the ascent of the very latest and most acid\r\nremaining portion of still fluid magma.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Messrs. Dakyns and Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nxlviii. (1892), p. 104.]\r\n\r\nThe case of Carrock Fell in Cumberland has been described by Mr.\r\nA. Harker, who has ascertained that the gabbro of this boss has in\r\nits central portions a specific gravity of less than 2·85 and a\r\nsilica-percentage sometimes as high as 59·46, whilst its marginal\r\nzone gives a specific gravity above 2·95 and a silica-percentage as\r\nlow as 32·50. The migration of the heavy iron ores towards the margin\r\nis readily apparent to the naked eye, and is well established by\r\nchemical analysis, the oxides of iron amounting in the centre to 6·24\r\n(Fe_{2}O_{3} 3·60, FeO 2·64), and at the margin to 25·54 (Fe_{2}O_{3}\r\n8·44, FeO 17·10).[40] Neither in this instance nor in that of Garabol\r\nHill has any evidence been noticed which would suggest that the basic\r\nand acid rocks belong to different periods of intrusion. They pass so\r\ninsensibly into each other as to form in each case one graduated mass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Mr. A. Harker, _op. cit._ p. 320.]\r\n\r\nFrom these and other examples which have been observed, it is difficult\r\nto escape the conclusion that the differences between the basic\r\nmargin and the acid centre are due to some process of segregation or\r\ndifferentiation while the mass was still in a liquid condition, and\r\nits constituents could pass from one part of the boss to another.\r\nAccording to Professor Brögger, it may be stated as a general law that\r\ndifferentiation sets in during consolidation, and is determined by,\r\nand dependent on, the laws of crystallization in a magma, in so far as\r\nthe compounds which, on given conditions, would first crystallize out,\r\ndiffuse themselves towards the cooling margin so as to produce in the\r\ncontact-stratum a peculiar chemical composition in the still liquid\r\nmaterial before crystallization takes place.[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: This general conclusion is stated by Professor Brögger\r\nfrom his investigation of the rocks of Gran, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nl. (1894), p. 36.]\r\n\r\nIf during the process of differentiation, and before consolidation,\r\ninjections of the magma occur, they may be expected to differ in\r\ncharacter according to the portion of the magma from which they are\r\nderived. Professor Brögger believes that among the basic eruptive\r\nrocks of Gran in the Christiania district, one and the same magma has\r\nin the bosses solidified as olivine-gabbro-diabases, and in the dykes\r\nas camptonites, bostonites, pyroxenites, hornblendites, and more acid\r\naugite-diorites.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ l. (1894), p. 35.]\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been propounded as to the cause or causes of this\r\nso-called differentiation, but none of them are entirely satisfactory.\r\nWe must await the results of further exploration in the field and of\r\ncontinued research in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to have taken place within a subterranean molten magma\r\nwhich has been propelled into the earth's crust as a boss or laccolite,\r\nwith or without a connected system of dykes, may possibly be made to\r\nthrow some light on the remarkable changes in the characters of lavas\r\nsuccessively erupted from the same vent during the continuance of a\r\nvolcanic cycle. Whether or not any such process of differentiation can\r\nbe proved to take place within a subterranean volcanic reservoir, the\r\nsequence of erupted lavas bears a curious resemblance to the order in\r\nwhich the constituents of some large bosses succeed each other from\r\nmargin to centre. The earliest lavas may be of an intermediate or\r\neven basic character, but they generally tend to become more acid.\r\nNevertheless alternations of basic and acid lavas which have been noted\r\nin various districts would seem to show that if there be a process of\r\ndifferentiation in the magma-basins, it is not regular and continuous,\r\nbut liable to interruption and renewal. The return to basic eruptions,\r\nwhich so often marks the close of a volcanic cycle, is likewise not\r\neasily explicable on the supposition of continuous differentiation.\r\n\r\nWhere no sensible evidence of differentiation is traceable in the\r\ngeneral body of a large intrusive mass, indications that some such\r\nprocess has there been in progress are perhaps supplied by the more\r\nacid dykes or veins, and the so-called \"segregation veins,\" which have\r\nbeen already alluded to as traversing large intrusive masses. Though\r\nthese portions differ to a greater or less extent in texture and\r\ncomposition from the main substance of the boss, the differences are\r\nnot such as to prevent us from regarding them as really parts of the\r\nsame parent magma. The veins, which are more acid than the rock that\r\nthey traverse, may be regarded as having emanated from some central\r\nor deeper-seated part of a boss, which still remained fluid after the\r\nmarginal or upper portion had consolidated sufficiently far to be\r\ncapable of being rent open during subterranean disturbance. But that\r\nthe mass, though coherent enough to be fissured, still remained at a\r\nhigh temperature, may be inferred from the general absence of chilled\r\nedges to these veins. The evidence of differentiation supplied by\r\n\"segregation veins\" has been referred to in the case of Sills.\r\n\r\nThe study of the petrographical variations in the constitution of large\r\neruptive bosses has a twofold interest for the geologist. In the first\r\nplace, it affords him material for an investigation of the changes\r\nwhich a volcanic magma undergoes during its eruption and consolidation,\r\nand thereby provides him with some data for an elucidation of the\r\ncause of the sequence of erupted products during a volcanic cycle.\r\nIn the second place, it yields to him some interesting analogies\r\nwith the structures of ancient gneisses, and thus helps towards the\r\ncomprehension of the origin and history of these profoundly difficult\r\nbut deeply fascinating rocks.\r\n\r\nBosses, like sills, occur in the midst of volcanic sheets, and also\r\nas solitary protrusions. Where they rise amidst interstratified lavas\r\nand tuffs they may often be recognized as occupying the position\r\nof volcanic vents. They are then necks, and their characters in\r\nthis connection have already been given. Where, however, as so\r\nfrequently happens, they appear among rocks in which no trace of any\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic material is to be detected, their relation to\r\nformer volcanic activity remains uncertain.\r\n\r\nOf this doubtful nature some of the most notable examples are supplied\r\nby the great granitic bosses which occur so frequently among the\r\nolder Palæozoic rocks of Britain. The age of these can sometimes\r\nbe approximately fixed, and is then found to correspond more or\r\nless closely with some volcanic episode. Thus the granite-bosses of\r\nGalloway, in the south of Scotland, disrupt Upper Silurian strata, but\r\nare older than the Upper Old Sandstone. Hence they probably belong\r\nto the period of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, which was eminently\r\ncharacterized by the vigour and long continuance of its volcanoes. The\r\ngranite of Arran and of the Mourne Mountains can be shown by one line\r\nof reasoning to be younger than surrounding Carboniferous formations,\r\nby other arguments to be probably later than the Permian period, and\r\nby a review of the whole evidence to form almost certainly part of the\r\nvolcanic history of Tertiary time.\r\n\r\nBut even where it can be shown that the uprise of a huge boss of\r\neruptive material was geologically contemporaneous with energetic\r\nvolcanic action, this coincidence may not warrant the conclusion that\r\nthe boss therefore marks one of the volcanic centres of activity. Each\r\nexample must be judged by itself. There have, doubtless, been many\r\ncases of the intrusion of molten material in bosses, as well as in\r\nsills, without the establishment of any connection with the surface.\r\nSuch incompleted volcanoes have been revealed by denudation after the\r\nremoval of a great thickness of superincumbent rock. The evidence which\r\nwould have decided the question to what extent any of them became true\r\nvolcanic vents has thus been destroyed. We can only reason tentatively\r\nfrom a careful collation of all the facts that are now recoverable.\r\nIllustrations of this kind of reasoning will be fully given in\r\nsubsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that a test for the discrimination of a\r\nsubterranean protrusion from a true volcanic chimney may be found\r\nin the condition of the surrounding rocks, which in the case of the\r\nprolonged flow of molten matter up a vent would be likely to undergo\r\nfar more metamorphism than would be the case in the injection of a\r\nsingle eruptive mass.[43] But, as has been already pointed out, no\r\nspecial or excessive metamorphism of the encircling rocks is noticeable\r\naround many vents. There is certainly no more alteration contiguous\r\nto numerous true necks than around bosses, which there is no reason to\r\nsuppose ever communicated directly with the surface, and which were\r\nprobably the result of a single intrusion. We must always remember\r\nthat the denudation which has revealed these bosses has generally\r\nremoved the evidence of their upward termination and of their possible\r\nconnection with any volcanic ejections. Many of them may mark the sites\r\nof true vents from which only single eruptions took place. The opening\r\nof a volcanic vent does not necessarily imply a prolonged ascent of\r\nvolcanic material. In a vast number of cases the original eruption was\r\nthe first and last effort of the volcano, so that in such circumstances\r\nthere seems no more reason for much alteration of the walls of the\r\nchimney than for the metamorphism of the rocks round a boss, laccolite,\r\nsill or dyke.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See, for example, Mr. Harker, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nl. (1894), p. 329.]\r\n\r\nThe metamorphism produced by intrusions of molten material upon the\r\nrocks with which they have come in contact has long been studied.\r\nIts amount varies so greatly in different cases that the conditions\r\non which it has specially depended are not easily determined. Three\r\nfactors have obviously been of great importance--first, the bulk\r\nof the intruded material; secondly, the chemical composition and\r\nlithological texture and structure of the rocks affected; and thirdly,\r\nthe constitution and temperature of the invading magma.\r\n\r\n1. It is clear that a huge boss of eruptive material will be likely to\r\neffect much more alteration of the surrounding rocks than a small boss,\r\nsill or dyke. Its initial temperature will probably be higher at the\r\ntime of its assuming its final place than that of the same material\r\nafter it has found its way into the narrower space of a thin sill or\r\ndyke. It will likewise take much longer to cool. Hence the influence of\r\nits heat and its vapours will continue to act long after those of the\r\ndyke or sill have ceased to manifest themselves.\r\n\r\n2. It is equally evident that much of the resultant metamorphism will\r\ndepend on the susceptibility of the rocks to change. An obdurate\r\nmaterial such as pure quartz-sand, for example, will resist further\r\nalteration than mere hardening into quartzite. Shales and mudstones may\r\nbe indurated into cherty substances of various textures. Limestones\r\nand dolomites, on the other hand, may become entirely crystalline,\r\nand may even have new minerals, such as garnet, tremolite, pyroxene,\r\netc., developed in them. Hence in comparing the amount of metamorphism\r\nattendant on two separate bosses we must always take into account the\r\nnature of the rocks in which it has been induced.\r\n\r\n3. But perhaps the most effective cause of variation in the nature\r\nand amount of contact metamorphism has been the constitution of the\r\neruptive magma. A broad distinction may be drawn between the alteration\r\nproduced by basic and by acid rocks. The intrusion of basic material\r\nhas often produced singularly little change, even when the eruptive\r\nmass has been of considerable size. The greatest amount of alteration\r\nis to be found where the basic boss has caught up and enveloped\r\nportions of the surrounding rocks. Thus where the gabbro of Carrock\r\nFell has invaded the basic Lower Silurian lavas of the Lake District,\r\nthe enveloped portions of the latter show considerable modification.\r\nTheir groundmass becomes darker and more lustrous, the felspars assume\r\na clearer appearance and lose some of their conspicuous inclusions,\r\nthe pyroxenic constituents are converted into pale amphibole, and the\r\nglassy base disappears. At the actual line of contact the felspars of\r\nthe lavas have become disengaged from their original matrix, which\r\nseems to have been dissolved and absorbed in the gabbro-magma. Brown\r\nmica has been exceptionally developed in the altered lava. At the same\r\ntime, a change is noticeable in the character of the gabbro itself near\r\nthe contact. Brown mica is there to be seen, though not a constituent\r\nof the rock elsewhere. The eruptive material has incorporated the basic\r\ngroundmass of the lavas, leaving the felspars undissolved.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Mr. Harker, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. (1894), p.\r\n331.]\r\n\r\nMuch more serious are the changes produced by intrusions of acid\r\nmaterial, though here again the metamorphism varies within wide limits,\r\nbeing sometimes hardly perceptible, and in other cases advancing\r\nso far as to convert mere sedimentary material into thoroughly\r\ncrystalline rocks. Small sills and dykes of felsite and granophyre\r\nmay produce very slight change even upon shales and limestones, as\r\nmay be seen among the eruptive rocks of Skye and Raasay. Large bosses\r\nof granophyre, and still more of granite, have been accompanied with\r\nthe most extensive metamorphism. Round these eruptive masses every\r\ngradation may be traced among sandy and argillaceous sediments, until\r\nthey pass into crystalline mica-schists, which do not appear to be\r\ndistinguishable from rocks of Archæan age. Admirable examples of this\r\nextreme alteration may be observed around the great granite bosses of\r\nGalloway.[45] Again, among calcareous rocks a transition may be traced\r\nfrom dull grey ordinary fossiliferous limestones and dolomites into\r\npure white crystalline marbles, full of crystals of tremolite, zoisite,\r\ngarnet and other minerals. The alteration of the fossiliferous Cambrian\r\nlimestones of Strath in Skye by the intrusive bosses of Tertiary\r\ngranite well illustrates this change.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Explanation to Sheet 9 of the _Geological Survey of\r\nScotland_, p. 22; Prof. Bonney and Mr. Allport, _Proc. Roy. Soc._ xvi.\r\n(1889); Miss Gardiner, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p.\r\n569.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Macculloch, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ vol. iii.

(1888), p.\r\n62.]\r\n\r\nWithout entering further here into the wide subject of contact\r\nmetamorphism, to which a large literature has now been devoted, we may\r\nnote the effects which have been produced in the eruptive material\r\nitself by its contact with the surrounding rocks. Not only have these\r\nrocks been altered, but very considerable modifications have likewise\r\ntaken place in the active agent of the change.\r\n\r\nSometimes the alteration of the invading material has been effected\r\nwithout any sensible absorption of the mineral constituents of the\r\nrocks invaded. This appears to be the case in those instances where\r\nsheets of basalt, intruded among coals or highly carbonaceous shales,\r\nhave lost their compact crystalline character and have become mere\r\nclays. In the coal-fields of Britain, where many examples of this\r\nchange have been noted, the igneous material is known as \"white trap.\"\r\nThe iron oxides have been in great part removed, or, together with the\r\nlime of the component minerals, have been converted into carbonates.\r\nTraces of the original felspar crystals may still be detected, but the\r\ngroundmass has been changed into a dull, earthy, friable and decomposed\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nNearly always, however, the alteration of the intrusive magma has\r\nresulted from the incorporation of portions of the surrounding rocks.\r\nReference has been made above to the alteration of the Carrock Fell\r\ngabbro by the absorption of some of the basic lavas around it. But\r\nstill more remarkable is the change produced in some acid rocks by the\r\nincorporation of basic material into their substance. Professor Sollas\r\nhas described in great detail a remarkable instance of this effect in\r\nthe probably Tertiary eruptive rocks of the Carlingford district in\r\nthe north-east of Ireland. He has ascertained that the eruptive gabbro\r\nof that district is older than the granite, for it is traversed by\r\ngranophyre dykes which enclose pieces of it. The granophyre dykes,\r\non the other hand, often show a lithoidal or chilled margin, which\r\nis not visible in the gabbro. He believes that the gabbro is not\r\nonly older than the acid protrusions, but was already completely\r\nsolid, traversed by contraction-joints, and probably fractured by\r\nearth-movements, before the injection of the granophyric material,\r\nwhich at the time of its intrusion was in a state of extreme fluidity,\r\nfor it has found its way into the minutest cracks and crevices. He has\r\nespecially studied the alteration produced by the granophyre upon the\r\nenclosed pieces of basic rock. The diallage, isolated from the other\r\nconstituents of the gabbro, may commonly be seen to have broken up into\r\nnumerous granules, like the augite grains of basalt, while in some\r\ncases biotite and hornblende have been developed with the concomitant\r\nexcretion of magnetite. The acid rock itself has undergone considerable\r\nmodification owing to the incorporation of basic material into its\r\nsubstance. Professor Sollas distinguishes the following varieties\r\nof the rock:--Biotite-granophyre, biotite-amphibole-granophyre,\r\naugite-granophyre, diallage-amphibole-augite-granophyre.[47]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ xxx. (1894), part xii. p. 477.]\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena have been described by Mr. Harker as occurring\r\nwhere granophyre has invaded the gabbro of Carrock Fell.[48] The same\r\nobserver has more recently detected some interesting examples furnished\r\nby injections of Tertiary granophyre in the agglomerates of Skye. The\r\nacid rock is roughly estimated by him to have taken up about one-fourth\r\nof its bulk of gabbro fragments. He has investigated the minute\r\nstructure of the rock thus constituted, and has been able to recognize\r\nthe augite of the original gabbro, in various stages of alteration and\r\ncompletely isolated, the other minerals having been dissolved in the\r\nacid magma.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ li. (1895), p. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Op. cit._ lii. The metamorphism produced upon fragments\r\nof different kinds of foreign material enclosed within various igneous\r\nrocks has in recent years been studied in great detail by Professor\r\nLacroix--_Les Enclaves des Roches Volcaniques_, Macon, 1893.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to comprehend the conditions under which large masses\r\nof molten material have been injected into the crust of the earth. The\r\ntwo main factors in volcanic action--terrestrial contraction and the\r\nenergy of the vapours in the magma--have no doubt played the chief part\r\nin the process. But the relative share of each and the way in which\r\nthe enormous load of overlying rock has been overcome are not readily\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider for a moment the pressure of the superincumbent\r\ncrust under which the injection in many cases took place. The Whin Sill\r\nof England may serve as a good illustration of the difficulties of the\r\nproblem. This notable mass of intrusive rock has been forced between\r\nthe stratification planes of the Carboniferous Limestone series in\r\none, or sometimes more than one, sheet. It stretches for a horizontal\r\ndistance of not less than 80 miles with an average thickness of between\r\n80 and 100 feet. From the area over which it can be traced its total\r\nextent underground must be at least 400 square miles (see Chapter\r\nxxix.).\r\n\r\nIn any single section the Whin Sill might be supposed to be a truly\r\ninterstratified sheet, so evenly does it seem to be intercalated\r\nbetween the sedimentary strata. But here and there it diverges\r\nupward or downward in such a way as to prove it to be really a vast\r\ninjected sheet. The age of the injection cannot be precisely fixed.\r\nIt must be later than the Carboniferous Limestone. There is no trace\r\nof any stratigraphical break in the Carboniferous system of the\r\nregion traversed by the sill. If the injection took place during the\r\nCarboniferous period, it does not appear to have been attended with any\r\nlocal disturbance, such as we might suppose would have been likely to\r\naccompany the extravasation of so enormous a mass of igneous material.\r\nIf the date of injection be assigned to the next volcanic episode in\r\nthe geological history of Britain--that of the Permian period--it will\r\nfollow that the Whin Sill was intruded into its present position under\r\nthe superincumbent weight of the whole of the Carboniferous system\r\nhigher than the platform followed by the injected rock. The overlying\r\nbody of strata would thus exceed 5000 feet in thickness, or in round\r\nnumbers would amount at least to an English mile. The pressure of this\r\nmass of superincumbent material, at the depth at which the injected\r\nmagma was forced between the strata, must have been so gigantic that it\r\nis difficult to believe that the energy of the magma would have been\r\nable to achieve of itself so stupendous a task as the formation of the\r\nGreat Whin Sill.\r\n\r\nThe volume of injected material is likewise deserving of special\r\nattention. Many sills exceed 300 or 400 feet in thickness; and some\r\nlaccolites must enormously surpass these limits. The intrusion of so\r\nvast a body of new material into the terrestrial crust will necessitate\r\neither a corresponding elevation of that part of the crust overlying\r\nthe injected magma or a subsidence of that part underlying it, or some\r\ncombination of both movements. It is conceivable that, where the body\r\nof protruded magma was large and the thickness of overlying crust was\r\nsmall, the expansive force of the vapours under high tension in the\r\nmolten rock may have sufficed for the uplift. This result will be most\r\nlikely to be effected around a volcanic chimney where the magma has\r\nthe least amount of overlying load, and encounters that relief from\r\npressure which enables it to become a powerful agent in terrestrial\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of the larger bodies of injected rock, especially\r\nwhere they do not seem to have been accompanied by the opening of any\r\nvolcanic vents, the propulsion of the igneous material into the crust\r\nhas probably been effected as a consequence of disturbance of the\r\nterrestrial crust. When the strain of contraction leads to the pushing\r\nupward of the terrestrial areas intervening between wide regions of\r\nsubsidence, even though the differential movement may be slight,\r\nthe isogeotherms undergo deformation. The intensely hot nucleus is\r\nsqueezed upward, and if in the process of compression ruptures take\r\nplace in the crust, and cavities in it are consequently opened, the\r\nmagma will at once be forced into them. Such ruptures may be expected\r\nto take place along lines of weakness. Rocks will split along their\r\nstratification-planes, and the tendency to separation along these lines\r\nmay be aided by the readiness of the energetic magma to find its way\r\ninto and to enlarge every available opening. Hence we may expect that,\r\nbesides vertical fractures, leading to the production of dykes and\r\nbosses, there will often be horizontal thrusts and ruptures, which will\r\ngive rise to the formation of sills.\r\n\r\nThere is still another feature of terrestrial contraction which\r\nmay help us to follow the behaviour of the magma within the crust.\r\nPlication of the crust is one of the most characteristic results of the\r\ncontracting strain. Where a great series of sedimentary formations has\r\nbeen violently compressed so that its component strata have been thrown\r\ninto rapid folds and squeezed into a vertical position, the portion\r\nof the crust thus treated may possibly be on the whole strengthened\r\nagainst the uprise of molten material through it. But the folding is\r\noften accompanied with dislocation. Not only are the rocks thrown into\r\nendless plications, but portions of them are ruptured and even driven\r\nhorizontally over other parts. Such greatly disturbed areas of the\r\ncrust are not infrequently found to have been plentifully injected with\r\nigneous rocks in the form of dykes, veins, sills, laccolites and bosses.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of a mountain-chain is known to be accompanied with\r\na diminution of density in the crust underneath. Mr. O. Fisher has\r\nsuggested that along such lines of terrestrial uplift there may be a\r\ndouble bulge in the crust, one portion rising to form the upheaved\r\nland and the other sinking down into the hot nucleus. If the lighter\r\ndescending crust were there melted it might form a magma ready to be\r\npoured out as lava on the opening of any vent. The lava thus ejected\r\nwould be of the lighter kinds. It has been remarked as certainly a\r\ncurious fact that the lavas which issue from high mountain ranges\r\nare generally much more acid than the heavy basic lavas which are so\r\ncharacteristic of volcanoes close to the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut even where no actual mountain-chain is formed, there are gentle\r\nundulations of the crust which no doubt also affect the isogeotherms.\r\nIf any series of disturbances should give rise to a double system of\r\nsuch undulations, one crossing the other, there would be limited\r\ndome-shaped elevations at the intersections of these waves, and if\r\nat the same time actual rupture of the crust should take place, the\r\nmagma might find its way upward under such domes and give rise to the\r\nformation of laccolitic intrusions. Cessation of the earth-movements\r\nmight allow the intruded material slowly to solidify without ever\r\nmaking an opening to the surface and forming a volcano. Doubtless many\r\nsills, laccolites and bosses represent such early or arrested stages in\r\nvolcanic history.\r\n\r\nPropelled into the crust at a high temperature, and endowed with great\r\nenergy from the tension of its absorbed vapours and gases, the magma\r\nwill avail itself of every rent which may be opened in the surrounding\r\ncrust, and where it has succeeded in reaching the surface, its own\r\nexplosive violence may enable it to rupture the crust still further,\r\nand open for itself many new passages. Thus an eruptive laccolite or\r\nboss is often fringed with veins, dykes and sills which proceed from\r\nits mass into the rocks around.\r\n\r\nThe question how far an ascending mass of magma can melt down its\r\nwalls is one to which no definite answer can yet be given. Recent\r\nobservations show that where the difference in the silica percentage\r\nbetween the magma and the rock attacked is great, there may be\r\nconsiderable dissolution of material from this cause. Allusion has\r\nalready been made to Mr. Harker's computation that some of the acid\r\ngranophyres of Skye have melted down about a fourth of their bulk of\r\nthe basic gabbros. If such a reaction should take place between the\r\nmagma of a boss, sill or laccolite and the rocks among which it has\r\nbeen intruded, great changes might result in the composition of the\r\nintruded rock. We are not yet, however, in possession of evidence\r\nto indicate that absorption of this kind really takes place on an\r\nextensive scale within the earth's crust. If it did occur to a large\r\nextent, we should expect much greater varieties in the composition of\r\neruptive rocks than usually occur, and also some observable relation\r\nbetween the composition of the igneous material and that of the rocks\r\ninto which it has been injected. But enough is not yet known of this\r\nsubject to warrant any decided opinion regarding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  Influence of Volcanic Rocks on the Scenery of the Land--Effects of\r\n     Denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs considerable popular misapprehension exists respecting the part\r\nwhich volcanism has played in the evolution of the existing topography\r\nof the earth's surface, and as the British Isles, from their varied\r\ngeological structure, offer special facilities for the discussion of\r\nthis subject, it may not be out of place to devote a final section of\r\nthe present Introduction to a consideration of the real topographical\r\ninfluence of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nWith modern, and especially with active, volcanoes we need not here\r\nconcern ourselves. Their topographical forms are well known, and give\r\nrise to no difficulty. The lofty cones of the Vesuvian type, with their\r\nwidespread lavas and ashes, their vast craters and their abundant\r\nparasitic volcanoes; the crowded, but generally diminutive, cones\r\nand domes of the puy type, so well displayed in Auvergne, the Eifel\r\nand the Bay of Naples; and the vast lava deserts of the plateaux, so\r\ncharacteristically developed in Iceland and Western America, illustrate\r\nthe various ways in which volcanic energy directly changes the contours\r\nof a terrestrial surface.\r\n\r\nBut the circumstances are altered when we deal with the topographical\r\ninfluence of long extinct volcanoes. Other agencies then come into\r\nplay, and some caution may be needed in the effort to disentangle the\r\nelements of the complicated problem, and to assign to each contributing\r\ncause its own proper effect.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the continuous denudation of\r\nvolcanic hills from the time that they are first erupted. But the\r\ncomparative rapidity of the waste and the remarkable topographical\r\nchanges which it involves can hardly be adequately realized without\r\nthe inspection of an actual example. A visit to the back of Monte\r\nSomma, already alluded to, will teach the observer, far more vividly\r\nthan books can do, how a volcanic cone is affected by daily meteoric\r\nchanges. The sides of such a cone may remain tolerably uniform slopes\r\nso long as they are always being renewed by deposits from fresh\r\neruptions. But when the volcanic activity ceases, and the declivities\r\nundergo no such reparation, they are rapidly channelled by the descent\r\nof rain-water, until the furrows grow by degrees wide and deep ravines,\r\nwith only narrow and continually-diminishing crests between them. If\r\nunchecked by any fresh discharge of volcanic material, the degradation\r\nwill at last have removed the whole cone.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that purely volcanic topography, that is, the\r\nterrestrial scenery due directly to the eruption of materials from\r\nwithin the earth, can never become in a geological sense very old.\r\nIt can only endure so long as it is continually renewed by fresh\r\neruptions, or where it is carried down by subsidence under water and is\r\nthere buried under a cover of protecting sediments. When, therefore,\r\nwe meet with volcanic rocks of ancient date exposed at the surface,\r\nwe may be quite certain that their present contours are not those of\r\nthe original volcano, but have been brought about by the processes of\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, in the general erosion of the surface of the land,\r\nvolcanic rocks of ancient date sometimes rise into wonderfully craggy\r\nheights, including, perhaps, cones and deep crater-like hollows, which\r\nto popular imagination betoken contours left by now extinguished\r\nvolcanic fires. Examples of such scenery are familiar in various\r\nparts of Britain; but the resemblance to recent volcanic topography\r\nis deceptive. There are, indeed, a few hills wherein the progress of\r\ndenudation seems not as yet to have entirely removed the lavas and\r\ntuffs that gathered round the original vents. Some of the tuff-cones\r\nof eastern Fife, for example, present cases of this kind. Again, the\r\ngreat granophyre domes and cones of the Tertiary volcanic series of the\r\nInner Hebrides, though they have undoubtedly been extensively denuded,\r\nmay possibly retain contours that do not greatly differ from those\r\nwhich these protruded bosses originally assumed under the mass of rock\r\nwhich has been removed from them. Nevertheless, putting such doubtful\r\nexceptions aside, we may confidently affirm that hills composed of\r\nancient volcanic material give no clue to the forms of the original\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be too often repeated that the fundamental law in\r\nthe universal decay and sculpture of the land is that the waste is\r\nproportioned to the resistance offered to it: the softer rocks are\r\nworn down with comparative rapidity, while the harder varieties\r\nare left projecting above them. As a general rule, volcanic rocks\r\nare more durable than those among which they are interstratified,\r\nand hence project above them, but this is not always the case. No\r\nuniversal rule can, indeed, be laid down with regard to the relative\r\ndurability of any rocks. While, therefore, topographic contours afford\r\na valuable indication of the nature and disposition of the rocks below\r\nthe surface, they cannot be relied upon as in all circumstances an\r\ninfallible guide in this respect. No better proof can be offered of the\r\ncaution that is needed in tracing such contours back to their origin\r\nthan is furnished by the old volcanic rocks of Britain. These eruptive\r\nmasses, consisting usually of durable materials and ranging through a\r\nvast cycle of geological time, usually rise into prominent features and\r\nthus support the general law. But they include also many easily eroded\r\nmembers, which, instead of forming eminences, are worn into hollows.\r\nThey include, in short, every type of scenery, from featureless plains\r\nand rolling lowlands to craggy and spiry mountains.\r\n\r\nThe first point, then, which is established in an investigation of\r\nthe topographical influence of old volcanic rocks is that their\r\nprevailing prominence arises from relative durability amidst universal\r\ndegradation. When we proceed further to inquire why they vary so\r\nmuch from each other in different places, and how their complicated\r\ndetails of feature have been elaborated, we soon learn that such local\r\npeculiarities have arisen mainly from variations in the internal\r\nstructure and grouping of the rocks themselves.\r\n\r\nHere again the general law of sculpture comes into play. The local\r\nfeatures have depended upon the comparative resistance offered to the\r\nsculpturing agents by the different portions of a volcanic series. Each\r\ndistinct variety of rock possesses its own characteristic internal\r\nstructure. The lines along which atmospheric disintegration will\r\nmost effectually carry on its carving work are thus already traced\r\nin the very substance and architecture of the rock itself. Each rock\r\nconsequently yields in its own way to the processes of disintegration,\r\nand thus contributes its own distinctive share to topographical feature.\r\n\r\nAmong the massive rocks abundant examples of such special types of\r\nweathering may be cited, from the acid and basic series, and from\r\nsuperficial lavas as well as from intrusive bosses and sills. Acid\r\nbosses, such as those of granite, granophyre and quartz-porphyry, tend\r\nto weather into blocks and finally into sand, and as this tendency\r\nis somewhat uniformly distributed through the rocks, they are apt to\r\nassume rounded, dome-shaped or conical forms which, at a distance, may\r\nseem to have smooth declivities, but on examination are generally found\r\nto be covered with a slowly-descending sheet of disintegrated blocks\r\nand debris (Fig. 346). When less prone to decay, and especially where\r\ntraversed by a strongly-defined system of vertical joints, they may\r\nshoot up into tower-like heights, with prominent spires and obelisks.\r\nBasic bosses, when their materials decay somewhat rapidly, give rise to\r\nanalogous topographical forms, though the more fertile soils which they\r\nproduce generally lead to their being clothed with vegetation. Where\r\nthey consist of an obdurate rock, much jointed and fissured, like the\r\ngabbro of the Inner Hebrides, they form exceedingly rugged mountains,\r\nterminating upward in serrated crests and groups of aiguilles (Figs.\r\n331, 333).\r\n\r\nAcid lavas that have been superficially erupted weather into\r\nirregularly craggy hills, like the flanks of Snowdon. Those of\r\nintermediate composition, where they have accumulated in thick masses,\r\nare apt to weather into conical forms, as may be seen among the\r\nCheviot, Pentland and Garleton Hills (Figs. 109, 110, 133); but where\r\nthey have been poured out in successive thin sheets they have built\r\nup undulating plateaux with terraced sides, as among the Ayrshire and\r\nCampsie Fells and the hills of Lorne (Figs. 99, 107). Basic lavas have\r\nissued in comparatively thin sheets, frequently columnar or slaggy,\r\nforming flat-topped hills and terraced escarpments, such as are\r\ntypically developed among the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of the Inner\r\nHebrides and the Faroe Islands (Figs. 11, 265, 283, 284, 286).\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent causes of local peculiarities of topography\r\namong old volcanic rocks is the intercalation of very distinct\r\nvarieties of material in the same volcanic series. Where, for instance,\r\nlavas and tuffs alternate, great inequalities of surface may be\r\nproduced. The tuffs, being generally more friable, decay faster and\r\ngive rise to hollows, while the lavas, being more durable, project in\r\nbold ridges or rise into mural escarpments (Fig. 265). Again, where\r\ndykes weather more readily than the rocks which they traverse, they\r\noriginate deep narrow clefts, while where they weather more slowly than\r\nthe rocks around them, they project as dark ribs. Thus in Skye some\r\ndykes which rise through the obdurate gabbro are marked by chasms which\r\nreach up even to the highest crests of the mountains (Fig. 333), while\r\nof those which run in the pale crumbling granophyre, some stand up as\r\nblack walls that can be followed with the eye across the ridges even\r\nfrom a long distance.\r\n\r\nMany further illustrations of these principles might be cited here from\r\nthe old volcanic districts of Britain. But they will present themselves\r\nsuccessively in later chapters. For my present purpose it is enough\r\nto show that the scenery of these districts is not directly due to\r\nvolcanic action, but is the immediate result of denudation acting upon\r\nvolcanic rocks, modified and directed by their geological structure.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be useful, in concluding the discussion of this\r\nsubject, to cite some typical volcanic regions in the British Isles as\r\nillustrations of the relations between geology and topography, which,\r\nbesides impressing the main lesson here enforced, may serve also to\r\nshow some of the striking contrasts which geology reveals between the\r\npresent and former conditions of the surface of the globe. Among these\r\ncontrasts none are more singular than those offered by tracts where\r\nvolcanic action has once been rife, and where the picture of ancient\r\ngeography presented in the rocks differs so widely from the scenery of\r\nthe same places to-day as to appeal vividly to the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe first district to which I may refer where ancient volcanic rocks\r\nare well developed is that of Devonshire. The story of the Devonian\r\nvolcanoes will be told in some detail in later chapters, when it will\r\nbe shown that the eruptions were again and again renewed during a long\r\ncourse of ages. Yet, abundant as the intercalated lavas and tuffs are,\r\nthey can hardly be said to have had any marked effect on the scenery,\r\nthough here and there a harder or larger mass of diabase rises into a\r\nprominent knoll or isolated hill. When the amount of volcanic material\r\nin this region is considered, we may feel some surprise at the trifling\r\ninfluence which it has exerted in the general denudation of the surface.\r\n\r\nTo one who wanders over the rich champaign of southern Devonshire, and\r\nsurveys from some higher prominence the undulating tree-crowned ridges\r\nthat slope down into orchard-filled hollows, and the green uplands\r\nthat sweep in successive waves of verdure to the distant blue tors of\r\nDartmoor, the scene appears as a type of all that is most peaceful,\r\nvaried and fertile in English landscape. In the trim luxuriance that\r\nmeets the eye on every side, the hand of man is apparent, though from\r\nmany a point of vantage no sound may be heard for a time to show that\r\nhe himself is anywhere near us. Yet ever and anon from the deep lanes,\r\nhidden out of sight under their canopy of foliage, there will come the\r\ncreak of the groaning waggon and the crack of the waggoner's whip, as\r\nevidence that there are roads and human traffic through this bosky\r\nsilent country.\r\n\r\nAmid so much quiet beauty, where every feature seems to be eloquent\r\nof long generations of undisturbed repose, it must surely stir the\r\nimagination to be told that underneath these orchards, meadows and\r\nwoodlands lie the mouldering remnants of once active and long-lived\r\nvolcanoes. Yet we have only to descend into one of the deep lanes to\r\nfind the crumbling lavas and ashes of the old eruptions. The landscape\r\nhas, in truth, been carved out of these volcanic rocks, and their\r\ndecomposition has furnished the rich loam that nourishes so luxuriant a\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nNot less impressive is the contrast presented between the present\r\nand former condition of the broad pastoral uplands of the south of\r\nScotland. Nowhere in the British Islands can the feeling of mere\r\nloneliness be more perfectly experienced than among these elevated\r\ntracts of bare moorland. They have nothing of the grandeur of outline\r\npeculiar to mountain tracts. Sometimes, for miles around one of their\r\nconspicuous summits, we may see no projecting knob or pinnacle. The\r\nrocks have been gently rounded off into broad featureless hills, which\r\nsink into winding valleys, each with its thread of streamlet and its\r\nfarms along the bottom, and its scattered remnants of birch-wood or\r\nalder-copse along its slopes and dingles. Across miles of heathy\r\npasture and moorland, on the summits of this great tableland, we may\r\nperchance see no sign of man or his handiwork, though the bleating of\r\nthe sheep and the far-off barking of the collie tell that we are here\r\nwithin the quiet domain of the south-country shepherd.\r\n\r\nIn this pastoral territory, also, though they hardly affect the\r\nscenery, volcanic rocks come to the surface where the foldings of the\r\nearth's crust have brought up the oldest formations. Their appearance\r\nextends over so wide an area as to show that a large part of these\r\nuplands lies on a deeply-buried volcanic floor. A whole series of\r\nsubmarine volcanoes, extending over an area of many hundreds of square\r\nmiles, and still in great part overlain with the accumulated sands and\r\nsilts of the sea-bottom, now hardened into stone, underlies these quiet\r\nhills and lonely valleys.\r\n\r\nA contrast of another type meets us in the broad midland valley of\r\nScotland. Around the city of Edinburgh, for instance, the landscape\r\nis diversified by many hills and crags which show where harder rocks\r\nproject from amidst the sediments of the Carboniferous system. On some\r\nof these crags the forts of the early races, the towers of Celt and\r\nSaxon, and the feudal castles of the middle ages were successively\r\nplanted, and round their base clustered for protection the cots of\r\nthe peasants and the earliest homesteads of the future city. Beneath\r\nthese crags many of the most notable events in the stormy annals of\r\nthe country were transacted. Under their shadow, and not without\r\ninspiration from their local form and colour, literature, art and\r\nscience have arisen and flourished. Nowhere, in short, within the\r\ncompass of the British Isles has the political and intellectual\r\nprogress of the people been more plainly affected by the environment\r\nthan in this central district of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhen now we inquire into the origin and history of the topography\r\nwhich has so influenced the population around it, we find that its\r\nprominences are relics of ancient volcanoes. The feudal towers are\r\nbased on sills and dykes and necks. The fields and gardens, monuments\r\nand roadways, overlie sheets of lava or beds of volcanic ashes. Not\r\nonly is every conspicuous eminence immediately around of volcanic\r\norigin, but even the ranges of blue hills that close in the distant\r\nview to south and north and east and west are mainly built up of lavas\r\nand tuffs. The eruptions of which these heights are memorials belong to\r\na vast range of geological ages, the latest of them having passed away\r\nlong before the advent of man. But they have left their traces deeply\r\nengraven in the rocky framework of the landscape. While human history,\r\nstormy or peaceful, has been slowly evolving itself during the progress\r\nof the centuries in these fertile lowlands, the crags and heights have\r\nremained as memorials of an earlier history when Central Scotland\r\ncontinued for many ages to be the theatre of vigorous volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nAs a final illustration of the influence of volcanic rocks in scenery,\r\nand of the contrast between their origin and their present condition,\r\nI may cite the more prominent groups of hills in the Inner Hebrides.\r\nIn the singularly varied landscapes of that region three distinct\r\ntypes of topography attract the eye of the traveller. These are best\r\ncombined and most fully developed in the island of Skye. Throughout\r\nthe northern half of that picturesque island, the ground rises into a\r\nrolling tableland, deeply penetrated by arms of the sea, into which it\r\nslopes in green declivities, while along its outer borders it plunges\r\nin ranges of precipice into the Atlantic. Everywhere, alike on the\r\ncliffs and the inland slopes, long parallel lines of rock-terrace\r\nmeet the eye. These mount one above another from the shores up to the\r\nflat tops of the highest hills, presenting level or gently-inclined\r\nbars of dark crag that rise above slopes of debris, green sward and\r\nbracken. It is these parallel, sharply-defined bars of rock, with their\r\nintervening strips of verdure, that give its distinctive character to\r\nthe scenery of northern Skye. On hillside after hillside and in valley\r\nafter valley, they reappear with the same almost artificial monotony.\r\nAnd far beyond the limits of Skye they are repeated in one island after\r\nanother, all down the chain of the Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to this scenery, and abruptly bounding it on the\r\nsouth, rise the Red Hills of Skye--a singular group of connected cones.\r\nAlike in form and in colour, these hills stand apart from everything\r\naround them. The verdure of the northern terraced tableland here\r\nentirely disappears. The slopes are sheets of angular debris,--huge\r\nblocks of naked stone and trails of sand, amidst which hardly any\r\nvegetation finds a footing. The decay of the rock gives it a pale\r\nyellowish-grey hue, which after rain deepens into russet, so that in\r\nfavourable lights these strange cones gleam with a warm glow as if\r\nthey, in some special way, could catch and reflect the radiance of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nImmediately to the west of these pale smooth-sloped cones, the dark\r\nmass of the Cuillin Hills completes the interruption of the northern\r\ntableland. In almost every topographical feature these hills present\r\na contrast to the other two kinds of scenery. Their forms are more\r\nrugged than those of any other hill-group in Britain (Fig. 331). Every\r\ndeclivity among them is an irregular pile of crags, every crest is\r\nnotched like a saw, every peak is sharpened into a pinnacle. Instead of\r\nbeing buried under vast sheets of their own debris, these hills show\r\neverywhere their naked rock, which seems to brave the elements as few\r\nother rocks can do. Unlike the pale Red Hills, they are dark, almost\r\nblack in tone, though when canopied with cloud they assume a hue of\r\ndeepest violet.\r\n\r\nEach of these three distinct types of topography owes its existence\r\nto the way in which a special kind of volcanic rock yields to the\r\ninfluences of denudation. The terraced tableland of the north is built\r\nup of hundreds of sheets of basaltic lava, each of the long level\r\nledges of brown rock marking the outcrop of one or more of these once\r\nmolten streams. The black rugged mass of the Cuillin Hills consists\r\nof a vast protruded body of eruptive material, which, in the form\r\nof endless sills and bosses of gabbro and dolerite, has invaded the\r\nbasalt-plateau, and has now been revealed by the gradual removal of the\r\nportion of that plateau which it upraised. The pale cones and domes\r\nof the Red Hills mark the place of one of the last protrusions in the\r\nvolcanic history of Britain--that of large masses of an acid magma,\r\nwhich broke through the basalt-plateau and also disrupted the earlier\r\ngabbro.\r\n\r\nIn no part of North-Western Europe has volcanic activity left more\r\nvaried and abundant records of its operations than in these three\r\ncontiguous tracts of Skye. It is interesting therefore to note the\r\nstriking contrast between the former and the present landscapes of the\r\nregion. The lavas of the basaltic tableland crumble into a rich loam,\r\nthat in the mild moist climate of the Hebrides supports a greener\r\nverdure than any of the other rocks around will yield. The uplands\r\nhave accordingly become pasture-grounds for herds of sheep and cattle.\r\nThe strips of lowland along the valleys and in the recesses of the\r\ncoast-line furnish the chief tracts of arable land in the island, and\r\nare thus the main centres of the crofter population. The bays and\r\ncreeks of the much-indented shores form natural harbours, which in\r\nformer days attracted the Norse sea-rovers, and supplied them with\r\nsites for their settlements. Norse names still linger on headland and\r\ninlet, but the spirit of adventure has passed away, and a few poor\r\nfishing-boats, here and there drawn up on the beach, are usually the\r\nonly token that the islanders make any attempt to gather the harvest of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe mountain groups which so abruptly bound the basalt-plateau on the\r\nsouth, and present in their topographical features such distinctive\r\nscenery, comprise a region too lofty, too rugged and too barren for\r\nhuman occupation. The black Cuillins and the pale Red Hills are\r\nsolitudes left to the few wild creatures that have not yet been\r\nexterminated. The corries are the home of the red deer. The gabbro\r\ncliffs are haunts of the eagle and the raven. Where patches of soil\r\nhave gathered in the crannies of the gabbro, alpine plants find their\r\nhome. In the chasms left by the decay of the dykes between the vertical\r\nwalls of their fissures, the winter snows linger into summer, and\r\nconceal with their thick drifts the mouldering surface of the once\r\nmolten rock beneath them. On every side and at every turn a mute appeal\r\nis made to the imagination by the strange contrasts between the quiet\r\nrestfulness of to-day, when the sculpture-tools of nature are each\r\nbusily carving the features of the landscape, and the tumult of the\r\ntime when the rocks, now so silent, were erupted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general discussion of the subject of Volcanism in this Introduction\r\nwill, I hope, have prepared the reader who has no special geological\r\ntraining for entering upon the more detailed descriptions in the\r\nrest of this treatise. As already stated, the chronological order\r\nof arrangement will be followed. Beginning with the records of the\r\nearliest ages, we shall follow the story of volcanic action down to the\r\nend of the latest eruptions.\r\n\r\nEach great geological system will be taken as a whole, representing a\r\nlong period of time, and its volcanic evolution will be traced from\r\nthe beginning of the period to the close. Some variety of treatment\r\nis necessarily entailed by the wide range in the nature and amount of\r\nthe evidence for the volcanic history of different ages. But where\r\npracticable, an outline will first be given of what can be gathered\r\nrespecting the physical geography of each geological period in Britain.\r\nIn the description which will then follow of the volcanic phenomena,\r\nan account of the general characters of the erupted rocks will precede\r\nthe more detailed narrative of the history of the volcanic eruptions in\r\nthe several regions where they took place. References to the published\r\nliterature of each formation will be given in the first part of each\r\nsection, or will be introduced in subsequent pages, as may be found\r\nmost convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ACTION IN PRE-CAMBRIAN TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPRE-CAMBRIAN VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n  The Beginnings of Geological History--Difficulties in fixing on\r\n     a generally-applicable Terminology--i.

The Malvern Volcano; vi. The Charnwood Forest\r\n     Volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early geological history of this globe, like the early history\r\nof mankind, must be drawn from records at once scanty and hardly\r\ndecipherable. Exposed to the long series of revolutions which the\r\nsurface of the planet has undergone, these records, never perhaps\r\ncomplete at the first, have been in large measure obliterated.\r\nEven where they still exist, their meaning is often so doubtful\r\nthat, in trying to interpret it, we find little solid footing,\r\nand feel ourselves to be groping, as it were, in the dimness of\r\nmythological legend, rather than working in the light of trustworthy\r\nand intelligible chronicles. These primeval records have been more\r\nparticularly the objects of sedulous study during the last twenty years\r\nall over Europe and in North America. A certain amount of progress in\r\ntheir decipherment has been made. But the problems they still present\r\nfor solution are numerous and obscure. Fortunately, with many of\r\nthese problems the subject of the present treatise is not immediately\r\nconnected. We need only concern ourselves with those which are related\r\nto the history of primeval volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nTo the earliest and least definite division of the geological annals\r\nvarious names have been applied. Some writers, believing that this\r\nperiod preceded the first appearance of plants or animals upon the\r\nglobe, have named it Azoic--the lifeless age of geological history. But\r\nthe absence of any hitherto detected trace of organic existence among\r\nthe oldest known rocks cannot be held to prove that these rocks were\r\nformed before the advent of living things on the surface of the earth.\r\nThe chance discovery of a single fossil, which might at any moment be\r\nmade, would show the name \"Azoic\" to be a misnomer. Other geologists,\r\nbelieving that, as a matter of fact, organic structures of low types do\r\nactually occur in them, have called these old rocks \"Eozoic,\" to denote\r\nthat they were deposited during the dawn of life upon our planet. But\r\nthe supposed organisms have not been everywhere accepted as evidence of\r\nformer life. By many able observers they are regarded as mere mineral\r\naggregates. Another term, \"Archæan,\" has been proposed for the primeval\r\nages of geological history, which are recorded in rocks that carry us\r\nas far as may ever be possible towards the beginnings of that history.\r\n\r\nIn choosing some general term to include the oldest known parts of the\r\nearth's crust, geologists are apt unconsciously to assume that the\r\nrocks thus classed together represent a definite section of geological\r\ntime, comparable, for instance, to that denoted by one of the Palæozoic\r\nsystems. Yet it is obvious that, under one of these general terms of\r\nconvenient classification, a most multifarious series of rocks may be\r\nincluded, representing not one but possibly many, and widely separated,\r\nperiods of geological history.\r\n\r\nIn many countries the oldest sedimentary accumulations, whether\r\nfossiliferous or not, are underlain by a series of crystalline rocks,\r\nwhich consist in great part of coarse massive gneisses and other\r\nschists. All over the world these rocks present a singular sameness of\r\nstructure and composition. What might be found below them no man can\r\nsay. They are in each country the oldest rocks of which anything is yet\r\nknown, and whatsoever may be our theory of their origin, we must, at\r\nleast for the present, start from them as the fundamental platform of\r\nthe terrestrial crust.\r\n\r\nBut though crystalline rocks of this persistent character are widely\r\ndistributed, both in the Old World and in the New, they in themselves\r\nfurnish no means of determining their precise geological age. No method\r\nhas yet been devised whereby the oldest gneiss of one country can be\r\nshown to be the true stratigraphical equivalent of the oldest gneiss of\r\nanother. Palæontology is here of no avail, and Petrology has not yet\r\nprovided us with such a genetic scheme as will enable us to make use of\r\nminerals and rock-structures, as we do of fossils, in the determination\r\nof geological horizons. All that can be positively affirmed regarding\r\nthe stratigraphical relations of the rocks in question is that they\r\nare vastly more ancient than the oldest sedimentary and fossiliferous\r\nformations in each country where they are found. The \"Lewisian\" gneiss\r\nof the north-west of Scotland, the \"Urgneiss\" of Central Europe, and\r\nthe \"Laurentian\" gneiss of Canada occupy similar stratigraphical\r\npositions, and present a close resemblance in lithological characters.\r\nWe may conveniently class them under one common name to denote this\r\ngeneral relationship. But we have, as yet, no means of determining how\r\nfar they belong to one continuous period of geological history. They\r\nmay really be of vastly different degrees of antiquity.\r\n\r\nFrom the very nature of the case, any name by which we may choose to\r\ndesignate such ancient rocks cannot possess the precise stratigraphical\r\nvalue of the terms applied to the fossiliferous formations. Yet the\r\nconvenience of possessing such a general descriptive epithet is obvious.\r\n\r\nUntil much more knowledge of the subject has been gained, any\r\nterminology which may be proposed must be regarded as more or less\r\nprovisional. The comprehensive term \"pre-Cambrian\" may be usefully\r\nadopted as a general designation for all rocks older than the base of\r\nthe Cambrian system, irrespective of their nature and origin. Already\r\nit is well known that under this term a vast series of rocks, igneous\r\nand sedimentary, is included. In some regions several successive\r\nformations, or systems of formations, may be recognized in this\r\nseries. But until some method has been devised for determining the\r\nstratigraphical relations of these formations in different regions,\r\nit would seem safest not to attempt to introduce general names for\r\nuniversal adoption, but to let the sequence of rocks in each distinct\r\ngeological province be expressed by a local terminology. This caution\r\nis more especially desirable in the case of sedimentary deposits.\r\nWe may surmise as to the equivalence of the rocks called Huronian,\r\nTorridonian and Longmyndian, but whilst so much is mere conjecture, it\r\nis certainly injudicious to transfer the local names of one province to\r\nthe rocks of another.\r\n\r\nThe only relaxation of this general precaution which I think may at\r\npresent be made is the adoption of a common name for the oldest type of\r\ngneisses. The term \"Archæan\" has been applied to these rocks, and if\r\nit is used simply to express a common petrographical type, occupying\r\nthe lowest horizon in the stratigraphical series of a country, it\r\nhas obvious advantages. But I would still retain the local names as\r\nsubordinate terms to mark the local characteristics of the Archæan\r\nrocks of each province. Thus the \"Laurentian\" rocks of Canada and the\r\n\"Lewisian\" rocks of Scotland are widely-separated representatives of\r\nthe peculiar stratigraphical series which is known as Archæan.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian rocks of Britain include several distinct systems or\r\ngroups. How far those of even one part of this comparatively limited\r\nregion are the proper equivalents of those of another and distant part\r\nis a problem still unsolved. Hence each distinct area, with its own\r\ntype of rocks, will here be treated by itself. The following rock-types\r\nwill be described: I. The Lewisian (Archæan) Gneiss; II.

THE LEWISIAN (ARCHAÆN) GNEISS\r\n\r\nThe British Isles are singularly fortunate in possessing an admirable\r\ndevelopment of pre-Cambrian rocks. These ancient masses rise up in\r\nvarious parts of the islands, but the region where they are most\r\nextensively displayed, and where their stratigraphical position\r\nand sequence are most clearly shown, lies in the north-west of\r\nScotland.[50] In that territory they form the whole chain of the\r\nOuter Hebrides, and likewise extend as an irregular selvage along the\r\nwestern margin of the counties of Sutherland and Ross. The lowest known\r\nplatform of the fossiliferous formations has there been discovered\r\nand has been traced for a distance of more than 100 miles. From this\r\ndefinite horizon, the high antiquity of all that lies below it is\r\nimpressively demonstrated. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 35) will\r\nexplain the general relations of the various geological formations of\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: These rocks have been the subject of much discussion, but\r\ngeologists are now agreed as to their succession and structure. A full\r\nsummary of the literature of the controversy regarding them will be\r\nfound in the _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_, vol. xliv.\r\n(1888), p. 378.]\r\n\r\nIn certain dark shales (_b_) which occupy a well-defined and\r\nreadily-traceable position among the rocks of Sutherland and Ross,\r\nnumerous specimens of the trilobite genus _Olenellus_, together with\r\nother fossils, have been found. By common consent among geologists, the\r\nzone of rock in which this genus appears is taken as the lowest stage\r\nof the Cambrian system. In Britain it marks the oldest known group of\r\nfossiliferous strata--the platform on which the whole of the Palæozoic\r\nsystems rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Diagram illustrating the stratigraphical\r\nrelations of the pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks of the North-west\r\nHighlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\n_c_, Durness Limestones, with Upper Cambrian and perhaps Lower Silurian\r\nfossils, 1500 feet, top nowhere seen. _b_, Serpulite grit and \"fucoid\"\r\nshales, 70 to 80 feet, containing the _Olenellus_-zone. _a_, Quartzite,\r\nwith abundant annelid tubes, about 600 feet. II. Red Sandstones and\r\nConglomerates, sometimes 8000 feet or more (Torridonian). I. Gneiss\r\nwith dykes, etc. (Lewisian).]\r\n\r\nFrom the definite geological epoch indicated by this platform, we can\r\ngo backward into pre-Cambrian time, and realize in some measure how\r\nprodigious must be the antiquity of the successive groups of rock which\r\nemerge from beneath the base of the Palæozoic systems. Nowhere is\r\nthis antiquity more impressively proclaimed than in the north-west of\r\nScotland. From below the _Olenellus_-zone with its underlying sheets of\r\nquartzite (_a_), a thick group of dull red sandstones and conglomerates\r\n(II.) rises into a series of detached conical or pyramidal mountains,\r\nwhich form one of the most characteristic features in the scenery of\r\nthat region. As this detrital formation is well developed around Loch\r\nTorridon, it has been termed Torridonian. It attains a thickness of\r\nat least 8000 or 10,000 feet, and is traceable all the way from the\r\nextreme northern headlands of Sutherland to the southern cliffs of the\r\nisland of Rum.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the chronological significance of the geological\r\nstructure of the north-west of Scotland, we are first impressed by the\r\nstratigraphical break between the base of the Cambrian system and the\r\nTorridonian deposits below. This break is so complete that here and\r\nthere the thick intervening mass of sandstones and conglomerates has\r\nbeen nearly or wholly removed by denudation before the lowest Cambrian\r\nstrata were laid down. Such a discordance marks the passage of a\r\nprotracted interval of time.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the composition of the Torridonian rocks is considered,\r\nfurther striking evidence is obtained of the lapse of long periods.\r\nThe sandstones, conglomerates and shales of this pre-Cambrian system\r\npresent no evidence of cataclysmal action. On the contrary, they bear\r\ntestimony that they were accumulated much in the same way and at the\r\nsame rate as the subsequent Palæozoic systems. In that primeval period,\r\nas now, sand and silt were spread out under lakes and seas, were\r\nripple-marked by the agitation of the water, and were gradually buried\r\nunder other layers of similar sediment. The accumulation of 10,000 feet\r\nof such gradually-assorted detritus must have demanded a long series of\r\nages. Here, then, in the internal structure of the Torridonian rocks,\r\nthere is proof that in passing across them, from their summit to their\r\nbase, we make another vast stride backward into the early past of\r\ngeological history.\r\n\r\nBut when attention is directed to the relations of the Torridonian\r\nstrata to the rocks beneath them, a still more striking proof of an\r\nenormously protracted period of time is obtained. Between the two\r\nseries of formations lies one of the most marked stratigraphical breaks\r\nin the geological structure of the British Isles. There is absolutely\r\nnothing in common between them, save that the conglomerates and\r\nsandstones have been largely made out of the waste of the underlying\r\ngneiss. The denudation of the crystalline rocks before the deposition\r\nof any of the Torridonian sediments must have been prolonged and\r\ngigantic. The more, indeed, we study the gneiss, the more do we feel\r\nimpressed by the evidence for the lapse of a vast interval of time,\r\nhere unrecorded in rock, between the last terrestrial movements\r\nindicated by the gneiss and the earliest of the Torridonian sediments.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, reasoning backward from the horizon of the\r\n_Olenellus_-zone, we are enabled to form some conception of the\r\nvastness of the antiquity of the fundamental rocks of the North-west\r\nHighlands. The nature and origin of these rocks acquire a special\r\ninterest from a consideration of their age. They contain the chronicles\r\nof the very beginnings of geological history, in so far as this history\r\nis contained in the crust of the earth. No part of the geological\r\nrecord is so obscure as this earliest chapter, but we need not here\r\nenter further into its difficulties than may be necessary for the\r\npurpose of understanding what light it can be made to throw on the\r\nearliest manifestations of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nUnder the term Lewisian Gneiss (I. in Fig. 35) a series of rocks is\r\ncomprised which differ from each other in composition, structure\r\nand age, though most of them possess such crystalline and generally\r\nfoliated characters as may be conveniently included under the\r\ndesignation of gneiss. The complexity of these ancient crystalline\r\nmasses was not recognized at the time when Murchison called them the\r\n\"Fundamental\" or \"Lewisian\" gneiss. It is only since the Geological\r\nSurvey began to study and map them in full detail that their true\r\nnature and history have begun to be understood.[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: See the Report of this Survey work by Messrs. Peach,\r\nHorne, Gunn, Clough, Cadell and Hinxman, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xliv. (1888), pp. 378-441; and Annual Reports of Director-General\r\nof the Geological Survey in the _Report of The Science and Art\r\nDepartment for 1894_, p. 279, and 1895, p. 17 of reprint. The general\r\narea of the gneiss is shown in Map I.]\r\n\r\nThe researches of the Survey have shown the so-called Lewisian\r\ngneiss to comprise the following five groups of rock: 1. A group of\r\nvarious more or less banded and foliated rocks which form together\r\nthe oldest and chief part of the gneiss (Fundamental complex); 2.\r\nHighly basic dykes cutting the first group; 3. Dykes and sills of\r\ndolerite, epidiorite and hornblende-schist; 4. A few dykes of peculiar\r\ncomposition; 5. Gneissose granite and pegmatite.\r\n\r\nThe first of these groups, forming the main body of the gneiss, has\r\nbeen critically studied on the mainland from Cape Wrath to Skye.\r\nBut its development in the Outer Hebrides has not yet been worked\r\nout, although the name \"Lewisian\" was actually taken from that chain\r\nof islands. So far as at present known, however, the gneiss of the\r\nHebrides repeats the essential characters of that of the mainland.\r\n\r\nMr. Teall, as the result of a careful investigation in the field and\r\nwith the microscope, has ascertained that on the mainland between Skye\r\nand Cape Wrath the rocks of the \"fundamental complex\" are essentially\r\ncomposed of olivine, hypersthene, augite (including diallage),\r\nhornblende, biotite, plagioclase, orthoclase, microcline and quartz. He\r\nhas further observed that these minerals are associated together in the\r\nsame manner as in peridotites, gabbros, diorites and granites. Treating\r\nthe rocks in accordance with their composition and partly with their\r\nstructure, but excluding theoretical considerations, he has arranged\r\nthem in the following five subdivisions:--\r\n\r\n  1. Rocks composed of ferro-magnesian minerals, without felspar or\r\n     quartz--Pyroxenites, Hornblendites.\r\n\r\n  2. Rocks in which pyroxenes are the dominating ferro-magnesian\r\n     constituents, felspar always being present, sometimes quartz: A,\r\n     Without quartz, Hypersthene-augite-rocks (pyroxene granulites;\r\n     rocks of the Baltimore-gabbro type) and augite-rocks (gabbros);\r\n     B, With quartz, Augite-gneiss.\r\n\r\n  3. Rocks in which hornblende is the prevalent ferro-magnesian\r\n     constituent: A, Without quartz, or containing it only in\r\n     small quantity; rocks basic in composition: (_a_) massive or\r\n     only slightly foliated (Amphibolites, as epidote-amphibolite,\r\n     zoisite-amphibolite, garnet-amphibolite); (_b_) foliated\r\n     (Hornblende-schist). B, With quartz; rocks intermediate or acid\r\n     in composition: (_a_) with compact hornblende and a granular\r\n     structure (Hornblende-gneiss proper); (_b_) with hornblende\r\n     occurring in fibrous or other aggregates; (_c_) with compact\r\n     hornblende and a more or less granulitic structure (Granulitic\r\n     hornblende-gneiss).\r\n\r\n  4. Rocks in which biotite is the predominant ferro-magnesian\r\n     constituent; felspar and quartz both present: (_a_) Biotite\r\n     occurring as independent plates or in aggregates of two or three\r\n     large individuals (Biotite-gneiss); (_b_) Biotite occurring\r\n     in aggregates of numerous small individuals (rare type);\r\n     (_c_) Biotite occurring as independent plates in a granulitic\r\n     structure.\r\n\r\n  5. Rocks in which muscovite and biotite are present, together with\r\n     felspar and quartz--Muscovite-biotite-gneiss. These, though not\r\n     forming a well-defined natural group, are placed together for\r\n     purposes of description. They are all foliated, some having the\r\n     aspect of mica-schists, others being typical augen-gneisses, or\r\n     light grey gneisses with abundant oligoclase and inclusions of\r\n     microlitic epidote.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of each of these types are usually restricted to relatively\r\nsmall areas, and they succeed each other with much irregularity all\r\nthe way from Skye to Cape Wrath. Their chemical and mineralogical\r\ncomposition proves them to have decided affinities with the plutonic\r\nigneous masses of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe only exceptions to this prevalent igneous type occur in the\r\ndistricts of Gairloch and Loch Carron, where the gneiss appears to be\r\nassociated with a group of mica-schists, graphitic-schists, quartzites\r\nand siliceous granulites, limestones, dolomites, chlorite-schists and\r\nother schists. That these are altered sedimentary formations can hardly\r\nbe doubted. What their precise relations to the fundamental complex\r\nof the gneiss may be has not yet been satisfactorily determined. They\r\nare certainly far older than the Torridon sandstone which covers them\r\nunconformably. Possibly they may represent a sedimentary formation\r\nstill more ancient than the gneiss.\r\n\r\nSave these obscure relics of a pre-Torridonian system of strata, the\r\ngneiss never presents any structure which suggests the alteration of\r\nclastic constituents. Everywhere its mineral composition points to\r\na connection with the subterranean intrusions of different igneous\r\nmagmas, while the manner in which its different rock-groups are\r\nassociated together, and the internal structure of some of them, still\r\nfurther link it with phenomena which will be described in succeeding\r\nchapters as parts of the records of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the fundamental complex, as bearing on the\r\norigin of the gneiss, is to be found in the occurrence of bosses and\r\nbands which are either non-foliated or foliated only in a slight\r\ndegree. These comparatively structureless portions present much of the\r\ncharacter of bosses or sills of true eruptive rocks. They occur in\r\nvarious parts of Sutherland and Ross. Their external margins are not\r\nwell defined, and they pass insensibly into the ordinary gneiss, the\r\ndark basic massive rocks shading off into coarse basic gneisses, and\r\nthe pegmatites of quartz and felspar which traverse them merging into\r\nbands of grey quartzose gneiss.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as present knowledge goes, the main body or\r\nfundamental complex of the Lewisian gneiss in the North-west Highlands\r\nof Scotland consists of what may have been originally a mass of\r\nvarious eruptive rocks. It has subsequently undergone a succession\r\nof deformations from enormous stresses within the terrestrial crust,\r\nwhich have been investigated with great care by the Geological Survey.\r\nBut it presents structures which, in spite of the abundant proofs of\r\ngreat mechanical deformation, are yet, I venture to think, original, or\r\nat least belong to the time of igneous protrusion before deformation\r\ntook place. The alternation of rocks of different petrographical\r\nconstitution suggests a succession of extravasations of eruptive\r\nmaterials, though it may not be always possible now to determine the\r\norder in which these followed each other. In the feebly foliated or\r\nmassive bands and bosses there is a parallel arrangement of their\r\nconstituent minerals or of fine and coarse crystalline layers which\r\nrecalls sometimes very strikingly the flow-structure of rhyolites and\r\nother lavas. This resemblance was strongly insisted on by Poulett\r\nScrope, who believed that the laminar structure of such rocks as gneiss\r\nand mica-schist was best explained by the supposition of the flow of a\r\ngranitic magma under great pressure within the earth's crust.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _Volcanoes_, pp. 140, 283, 299.]\r\n\r\nThe conviction that these parallel structures do, in some cases, really\r\nrepresent traces of movements in the original unconsolidated igneous\r\nmasses, not yet wholly effaced by later mechanical stresses, has been\r\ngreatly strengthened in my mind by a recent study of the structures of\r\nvarious eruptive bosses, especially those of gabbro in the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic series of the Inner Hebrides. The banded structure, the\r\nseparation of the constituent minerals into distinct layers or zones,\r\nthe alternation of markedly basic with more acid layers, and the\r\npuckering and plication of those bands, can be seen as perfectly among\r\nthe Tertiary gabbro bosses of Skye as in the Lewisian gneiss (see\r\nFigs. 336 and 337). It cannot be contended that such structures in the\r\ngabbro are due to any subsequent terrestrial disturbance and consequent\r\ndeformation. They must be accepted as part of the original structure\r\nof the molten magma.[53] It seems to me, therefore, highly probable\r\nthat the parallel banding in the uncrushed cores of the Lewisian gneiss\r\nreveals to us some of the movements of the original magma at the\r\ntime of its extrusion and before it underwent those great mechanical\r\nstresses which have so largely contributed to the production of many of\r\nits most characteristic structures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See A. Geikie and J. J. H. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. 1. (1894), p. 645.]\r\n\r\nWhile the material of the oldest gneiss presents many affinities to\r\nplutonic rocks of much younger date, a wide region of mere speculation\r\nopens out when we try to picture the conditions under which this\r\nmaterial was accumulated. Some geologists have boldly advanced the\r\ndoctrine that the Archæan gneisses represent the earliest crust that\r\nconsolidated upon the surface of the globe. But these rocks offer no\r\npoints of resemblance to the ordinary aspect of superficial volcanic\r\nejections. On the contrary, the coarsely-crystalline condition even\r\nof those portions of the gneiss which seem most nearly to represent\r\noriginal structure, the absence of anything like scoriæ or fragmental\r\nbands of any kind, and the resemblances which may be traced between\r\nparts of the gneiss and intrusive bosses of igneous rock compel us\r\nto seek the nearest analogies to the original gneiss in deep-seated\r\nmasses of eruptive material. It is difficult to conceive that any rocks\r\napproaching in character to the gabbros, picrites, granulites and other\r\ncoarsely-crystalline portions of the old gneiss could have consolidated\r\nat or near the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen the larger area of gneiss forming the chain of the Outer Hebrides\r\nis studied, we may obtain additional information regarding the probable\r\norigin and the earliest structures of the fundamental complex of the\r\nLewisian gneiss. In particular, we may look for some unfoliated cores\r\nof a more acid character, and perhaps for evidence which will show that\r\nboth acid and basic materials were successively protruded. We may even\r\nentertain a faint hope that some trace may be discovered of superficial\r\nor truly volcanic products connected with the bosses which recall those\r\nof later date and obviously eruptive nature. But up to the present time\r\nno indication of any such superficial accompaniments has been detected.\r\nIf any portions of the old gneiss represent the deeper parts of columns\r\nof molten rock that flowed out at the surface as lava, with discharges\r\nof fragmentary materials, all this superincumbent material, at least in\r\nthe regions which have been studied in detail, had disappeared entirely\r\nbefore the deposition of the very oldest part of the Torridonian rocks,\r\nunless some trace of it may remain among the pebbles of the Torridonian\r\nconglomerates, to which reference will be immediately made.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as the evidence now available allows a conclusion to\r\nbe drawn, the Lewisian gneiss reveals to us a primeval group of\r\neruptive rocks presenting a strong resemblance to some which in later\r\nformations are connected, as underground continuations, with bedded\r\nlavas and tuffs that were erupted at the surface; and although no\r\nproof has yet been obtained of true volcanic ejections associated with\r\nthe fundamental complex, the rocks seem to be most readily understood\r\nif we regard them as having consolidated from igneous fusion at some\r\ndepth, and we may plausibly infer that they may have been actually\r\nconnected with the discharge of volcanic materials at the surface. The\r\ngraphite-schists, mica-schists, and limestones of the Gairloch and Loch\r\nCarron may thus be surviving fragments of the stratified crust into\r\nwhich these deep-seated masses were intruded, and through which any\r\nvolcanic eruptions that were connected with them had to make their way.\r\n\r\nThe limited areas occupied by the several varieties of rock in the\r\nfundamental complex suggests the successive protrusion of different\r\nmagmas, or of different portions from one gradually changing magma.\r\nMr. Teall has ascertained that whenever in this series of rocks the\r\nrelative ages of two petrographical types can be clearly ascertained,\r\nthe more basic is older than the more acid.\r\n\r\nBut besides all the complexity arising from original diversity of area,\r\nstructure and composition among the successive intrusions, a further\r\nintricacy has been produced by the subsequent terrestrial disturbances,\r\nwhich on a gigantic scale affected the north-west of Europe after\r\nthe formation of the fundamental complex of the old gneiss, but long\r\nbefore the Torridonian period. By a series of terrestrial stresses that\r\ncame as precursors of those which in later geological times worked\r\nsuch great changes among the rocks of the Scottish Highlands, the\r\noriginal bosses and sheets of the gneiss were compressed, plicated,\r\nfractured and rolled out, acquiring in this process a crumpled,\r\nfoliated structure. Whether or not these disturbances were accompanied\r\nby any manifestations of superficial volcanic action has not yet\r\nbeen determined. But we know that they were followed by a succession\r\nof dyke-eruptions, to which, for extent and variety, there is no\r\nparallel in the geological structure of Britain, save in the remarkable\r\nassemblage of dykes belonging to the Tertiary volcanic period[54] (Fig.\r\n36).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xliv. (1888), p. 389 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walker & Boutall sc._\r\n\r\nFig. 36.--Map of a portion of the Lewisian gneiss of Ross-shire.\r\n\r\nTaken from Sheet 107 of the Geological Survey of Scotland on the scale\r\nof one inch to a mile. The white ground (A) marks the general body of\r\nthe Lewisian gneiss. This is traversed by dykes of dolerite (B), which\r\nare cut by later dykes of highly basic material (peridotite, picrite,\r\netc., P). The gneiss and its system of dykes is overlain unconformably\r\nby the nearly horizontal Torridon Sandstone (_t_), which is injected by\r\nsheets of oligoclase-porphyry (F).]\r\n\r\nFor the production of these dykes a series of fissures was first opened\r\nthrough the fundamental complex of the gneiss, having a general trend\r\nfrom E.S.E. to W.N.W., running in parallel lines for many miles, and so\r\nclose together in some places that fifteen or twenty of them occurred\r\nwithin a horizontal space of one mile. The fissures were probably not\r\nall formed at the same time; at all events, the molten materials that\r\nrose in them exhibit distinct evidence of a succession of upwellings\r\nfrom the igneous magma below.\r\n\r\nConsidered simply from the petrographical point of view, the materials\r\nthat have filled the fissures have been arranged by Mr. Teall in the\r\nfollowing groups: 1. Ultrabasic dykes, sometimes massive (peridotites),\r\nsometimes foliated (talcose schists containing carbonates and sometimes\r\ngedrite); 2. Basic dykes which where massive take the forms of dolerite\r\nand epidiorite, and where foliated appear as hornblende-schist, the\r\nsame dyke often presenting the three conditions of dolerite, epidiorite\r\nand hornblende-schist; 3. Dykes of peculiar composition, comprising\r\nmicrocline-mica rocks and biotite-diorite with macro-poikilitic\r\nplagioclase; 4. Granites and gneissose granites (biotite-granite with\r\nmicrocline); 5. Pegmatites (microcline-quartz rocks with a variable\r\namount of oligoclase or albite).[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Annual Report of Geological Survey for 1895_, p. 18 of\r\nreprint.]\r\n\r\nDistinct evidence of a succession of eruptions can be made out among\r\nthese rocks. By far the largest proportion of the dykes consists\r\nof basic materials. The oldest and most abundant of them are of\r\nplagioclase-augite rocks, which, where uncrushed, differ in no\r\nessential feature of structure or composition from the dolerites and\r\nbasalts of more modern periods, though they have been plentifully\r\nchanged into epidiorite and hornblende-schist.[56] They present,\r\ntoo, most of the broad features that characterize the dykes of later\r\ntimes--the central more coarsely-crystalline portion, the marginal band\r\nof finer grain, passing occasionally into what was probably a basic\r\nglass, and the transverse jointing. They belong to more than one period\r\nof emission, for they cross each other. They vary in width up to nearly\r\n200 feet, and sometimes run with singular persistence completely across\r\nthe whole breadth of the strip of gneiss in the west of Sutherland and\r\nRoss. Dozens of dykes have been followed by the Geological Survey for\r\ndistances of ten or twelve miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: See Mr. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xli.\r\n(1885), p. 133.]\r\n\r\nLater in time, and much less abundant, are certain highly basic\r\ndykes--peridotites with schistose modifications--which cut across the\r\ndolerites in a more nearly east-and-west direction. There are likewise\r\noccasional dykes of peculiar composition, which, as above stated,\r\nhave been distinguished by Mr. Teall as microcline-mica rocks and\r\nbiotite-diorite.\r\n\r\nLast of all comes a group of thoroughly acid rocks--varieties of\r\ngranite and pegmatite--which form intrusive sheets and dykes. The\r\ngranites contain biotite with microcline, and are sometimes gneissose.\r\nThe pegmatites are microcline-quartz rocks with a variable amount\r\nof oligoclase or albite. These dykes coincide in direction with the\r\nbasalts and dolerites, but they are apt to run together into belts of\r\ngranite and pegmatite, sometimes 1500 feet broad.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time no evidence has been found of any superficial\r\noutpouring of material in connection with this remarkable series of\r\ndykes in the Lewisian gneiss. That they may have been concomitant\r\nwith true volcanic eruptions may be plausibly inferred from the close\r\nanalogy which, in spite of their antiquity and the metamorphism they\r\nhave undergone, they still present to the system of dykes that forms\r\na part of the great Tertiary volcanic series of Antrim and the Inner\r\nHebrides. The close-set fissures running in a W.N.W direction, the\r\nabundant uprise into these fissures of basic igneous rocks, followed by\r\na later and more feeble extravasation of acid material, are features\r\nwhich in a singular manner anticipate the volcanic phenomena of\r\nTertiary time.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the high antiquity of these dykes. They\r\nwere already in place before the advent of those extraordinary vertical\r\nlines of shearing which have so greatly affected both the gneiss and\r\nthe dykes; and these movements, in turn, had long been accomplished\r\nbefore the Torridon Sandstone was laid down, for the dykes, with their\r\nabundant deformation, run up to and pass beneath the sandstone which\r\nburies them and all the rocks with which they are associated. Though\r\nlater than the original fundamental complex, the dykes have become so\r\nintegral and essential a part of the gneiss as it now exists that they\r\nmust be unhesitatingly grouped with it.\r\n\r\nWith so wide an extension of the subterranean relics of volcanic\r\nenergy, it is surely not too much to hope that somewhere there may\r\nhave been preserved, and may still be discovered, proofs that these\r\neruptive rocks opened a connection with the surface, and that we\r\nmay thus recognize vestiges of the superficial products of actual\r\nArchæan volcanoes. Among the pebbles in the conglomerates of the\r\nTorridon Sandstone there occur, indeed, fragments of felsites which\r\npossess great interest from the perfection with which they retain\r\nsome of the characteristic features of younger lavas. Mr. Teall has\r\ndescribed their minute structure. They are dark, purplish, compact\r\nrocks, consisting of a spherulitic micropegmatitic, micropoikilitic or\r\nmicrocrystalline groundmass, in which are imbedded porphyritic crystals\r\nor crystal-groups of felspar, often oligoclase. These spherulitic rocks\r\noccasionally show traces of perlitic structure. They bear a striking\r\nresemblance to some of the Uriconian felsites of Shropshire, pebbles\r\nfrom which occur in the Longmynd rocks.[57] These fragments suggest\r\nthe existence of volcanic materials at the surface when the Torridon\r\nSandstone was deposited. Possibly they may represent some vanished\r\nLewisian lavas. But the time between the uprise of the dykes and the\r\nformation of the Torridonian series was vast enough for the advent of\r\nmany successive volcanic episodes. The pebbles may therefore be the\r\nrelics of eruptions that took place long after the period of the dykes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Annual Report of Geological Survey for 1895_, p. 21 of\r\nreprint.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Torridonian strata no undoubted trace of any contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic eruptions has been met with.[58] The only relics of volcanic\r\nrocks in this enormous accumulation of sediments are the pebbles just\r\nreferred to, which may be referable to a time long anterior to the very\r\noldest parts of the Torridonian series.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: The supposed tuff referred to in _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. xlviii. (1892), p. 168, is probably not of truly volcanic\r\norigin.]\r\n\r\nThat Archæan time witnessed volcanic eruptions on a considerable scale,\r\nand with great variety of petrographical material, has recently been\r\nshown in detail by Mr. Otto Nordenskjöld from a study of the rocks\r\nof Småland in Sweden. He has described a series of acid outbursts,\r\nincluding masses of rhyolite and dacite, together with agglomerates and\r\ntuffs, likewise basic eruptions, with dioritic rocks, augite-porphyrite\r\nand breccia. He refers these rocks to the same age as most of the\r\nScandinavian gneisses, and remarks that though they have undergone\r\nmuch mechanical deformation and metamorphism, they have yet here and\r\nthere retained some of their distinctive volcanic structures, such as\r\nthe spherulitic.[59] When the large area of Lewisian gneiss forming\r\nthe chain of the Outer Hebrides is investigated it may possibly supply\r\nexamples of a similar series of ancient volcanic masses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: \"Über Archæische Ergussgesteine aus Småland,\" _Sveriges\r\nGeol. Undersökn_, No. 135 (1894).]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. THE DALRADIAN OR YOUNGER SCHISTS OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nWe now come to one of the great gaps in the geological record. The\r\nLewisian gneiss affords us glimpses of probable volcanic activity at\r\nthe very beginning of geological history. An enormous lapse of time,\r\napparently unrepresented in Britain by any geological record, must be\r\nmarked by the unconformability between the gneiss and the Torridon\r\nSandstone. Another prodigious interval is undoubtedly shown by the\r\nTorridonian series. Neither this thick accumulation of sediment nor\r\nthe Cambrian formations, which to a depth of some 2000 feet overlie\r\nthe Torridon Sandstone, have yielded any evidence of true superficial\r\neruptions, though they are traversed by numerous dykes, sills and\r\nbosses. The age of these intrusive masses cannot be precisely fixed; a\r\nlarge proportion of them is certainly older than the great terrestrial\r\ndisplacements and concurrent metamorphism of the North-West Highlands.\r\n\r\nWhile from the Lewisian gneiss upward to the highest visible Cambrian\r\nplatform in Sutherland, no vestige of contemporaneous volcanic rocks\r\nis to be seen, the continuity of the geological record is abruptly\r\nbroken at the top of the Durness Limestone. By a series of the most\r\nstupendous dislocations, the rocks of the terrestrial crust have there\r\nbeen displaced to such a degree that portions have been thrust westward\r\nfor a horizontal distance of sometimes as much as ten miles, while\r\nthey have been so crushed and sheared as to have often lost entirely\r\ntheir original structures, and to have passed into the crystalline\r\nand foliated condition of schists. Portions of the floor of Lewisian\r\ngneiss, and large masses of the Torridon Sandstone, which had been\r\nburied under the Cambrian sediments, have been torn up and driven over\r\nthe Durness Limestone and quartzite.\r\n\r\nThough much care has been bestowed by the officers of the Geological\r\nSurvey on the investigation of the complicated mass of material which,\r\npushed over the Cambrian strata, forms the mountainous ground that\r\nlies to the east of a line drawn from Loch Eribol, in the north of\r\nSutherland, to the south-east of Skye, some uncertainty still exists as\r\nto the age and history of the rocks of that region. For the purposes of\r\nthis work, therefore, the rest of the country eastwards to the line of\r\nthe Great Glen--that remarkable valley which cuts Scotland in two--may\r\nbe left out of account.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Great Glen the Scottish Highlands display a vast\r\nsuccession of crystalline schists, the true stratigraphical relations\r\nof which to the Lewisian gneiss have still to be determined, but which,\r\ntaken as a whole, no one now seriously doubts must be greatly younger\r\nthan that ancient rock. Murchison first suggested that the quartzites\r\nand limestones found in this newer series are the equivalents of\r\nthose of the North-West. This identification may yet be shown to be\r\ncorrect, but must be regarded as still unproved. Traces of fossils\r\n(annelid-pipes) have been found in some of the quartzites, but they\r\nafford little or no help in determining the horizons of the rocks.\r\nIn Donegal, where similar quartzites, limestones and schists are\r\nwell developed, obscure indications of organic remains (corals and\r\ngraptolites) have likewise been detected, but they also fail to supply\r\nany satisfactory basis for stratigraphical comparison.\r\n\r\nEssentially the schists of the Scottish Highlands east of the Great\r\nGlen consist of altered sedimentary rocks. Besides quartzites and\r\nlimestones, there occur thick masses of clay-slate and other slates\r\nand schists, with bands of graphitic schist, greywacke, pebbly grit,\r\nquartzite, boulder-beds and conglomerates. Among rocks that have been\r\nso disturbed and foliated it is necessarily difficult to determine the\r\ntrue order of succession. In the Central Highlands, however, a certain\r\ndefinite sequence has been found to continue as far as the ground has\r\nyet been mapped. Were the rocks always severely contorted, broken and\r\nplaced at high angles, this sequence might be deceptive, and leave\r\nstill uncertain the original order of deposition of the whole series.\r\nBut over many square miles the angles of inclination are low, and the\r\nsuccessive bands may be traced from hill to hill, across strath and\r\nglen, forming escarpments along the slopes and outliers on the summits,\r\nprecisely as gently-undulating beds of sandstone and limestone may be\r\nseen to do in the dales of Yorkshire. It is difficult to resist the\r\nbelief, though it may, perhaps, be premature to conclude, that this\r\nobvious and persistent order of succession really marks the original\r\nsequence of deposition. In Donegal also a definite arrangement of\r\nthe rock-groups has been ascertained which, when followed across the\r\ncountry, gives the key to its geological structure.[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Geol. Survey Memoirs: Geology of N.W. Donegal_, 1891.]\r\n\r\nIn the order of succession which has been recognized during the\r\nprogress of the Geological Survey through the Central and Southern\r\nHighlands, it is hard in many places to determine whether the sequence\r\nthat can be recognized is in an upward or downward direction. Two bands\r\nof limestone, which appear to retain their relative positions across\r\nScotland for a distance of some 230 miles, may afford a solution of\r\nthis difficulty, and if, as is probable, they are to be identified with\r\nthe similar limestones of Donegal, Mayo and Galway, their assistance\r\nwill thus be available across a tract of more than 400 miles. What is\r\nregarded as the lower zone of limestone is particularly well seen about\r\nLoch Tay; what is believed to be the upper is typically displayed in\r\nthe heart of Perthshire, about Blair-Athol.\r\n\r\nFrom under the Loch Tay Limestone a great thickness of mica-schists,\r\n\"green schists,\" schistose grits and conglomerates, slates and\r\ngreywackes, emerges up to the border of the Highlands. Above that\r\ncalcareous band thick masses of mica-schist and sericite-schist are\r\nsucceeded by a well-marked zone of quartzite, which forms the mountains\r\nof Ben-y-Glo and Schihallion, and stretches south-westward across\r\nArgyllshire into Islay and Jura. The second or Blair-Athol Limestone\r\nlies next to this quartzite. If the limestones are identical with those\r\nof Donegal, Mayo and Galway, the quartzites may doubtless be also\r\nregarded as continued in those of the same Irish counties, where they\r\nform some of the most conspicuous features in the scenery, since they\r\nrise into such conspicuous mountains as Erigal, Slieve League, Nephin,\r\nand the twelve Bins of Connemara.\r\n\r\nThe age of this vast system of altered rocks has still to be\r\ndetermined. It is possible that they may include some parts of the\r\nTorridonian series, or even here and there a wedge of the Lewisian\r\ngneiss driven into position by gigantic disruptions, like those of\r\nthe North-West Highlands. But there can be no doubt that the schists,\r\nquartzites and limestones form an assemblage of metamorphosed\r\nsedimentary strata which differs much in variety of petrographical\r\ncharacter, as well as in thickness, from the Torridonian sandstone,\r\nand which has not been identified as the equivalent of any known\r\nPalæozoic system or group of formations in Britain. It may conceivably\r\nembrace the Cambrian series of the North-West Highlands, and also the\r\nsedimentary deposits that succeeded the Durness Limestone, of which no\r\nrecognizable vestige remains in Sutherland or Ross.\r\n\r\nThat the metamorphic rocks east of the line of the Great Glen are at\r\nleast older than the Arenig formation of the Lower Silurian system\r\nmay be inferred from an interesting discovery recently made by the\r\nofficers of the Geological Survey. A narrow strip of rocks has been\r\nfound which, from their remarkable petrographical characters, their\r\norder of sequence and their scanty fossil contents (_Radiolaria_), are\r\nwith some confidence identified with a peculiar assemblage of rocks on\r\nthe Arenig horizon of the Silurian system in the Southern Uplands of\r\nScotland, to which fuller reference will be made in Chapter xii. This\r\nstrip or wedge of probably Lower Silurian strata intervenes between\r\nthe Highland schists and the Old Red Sandstone in Kincardineshire,\r\nForfarshire and Dumbartonshire. It has been recognized also, occupying\r\na similar position, in Tyrone in Ireland. The schists in some places\r\nretain their foliated character up to the abrupt line of junction\r\nwith the presumably Lower Silurian strata, while in other districts,\r\nas at Aberfoyle, they have been so little affected that it is hardly\r\npossible to draw a line between the Highland rocks and those of this\r\nborder-zone, which indeed are there perhaps more metamorphosed than the\r\nHighland grits to the north of them. The metamorphism of the schists\r\nmay have been mainly effected before the final disturbances that wedged\r\nin this strip of Silurian strata along the Highland border, though\r\nsome amount of crushing and schist-making seems to have accompanied\r\nthese disturbances. No trace of any similar strip of Palæozoic rocks\r\nhas ever been detected among the folds of the schists further into the\r\nHighlands. But some of the Highland rocks in the region of Loch Awe\r\nlose their metamorphosed character, and pass into sedimentary strata\r\nwhich, so far as petrographical characters are concerned, might well be\r\nPalæozoic.\r\n\r\nUntil some clue is found to the age of the Younger or Eastern schists,\r\nquartzites and limestones of the Highlands, it is desirable to have\r\nsome short convenient adjective to distinguish them. As a provisional\r\nterm for them I have proposed the term \"Dalradian,\" from Dalriada, the\r\nname of the old Celtic kingdom of the north of Ireland and south-west\r\nof Scotland.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Presidential Address to Geological Society_, 1891, p.\r\n39.]\r\n\r\nThe special feature for which this Dalradian series is cited in\r\nthe present volume is the evidence it furnishes of powerful and\r\nextensive volcanic action. In a series of rocks so greatly dislocated,\r\ncrumpled and metamorphosed, we cannot look for the usual clear proofs\r\nof contemporaneous eruptions. Nevertheless all over the Scottish\r\nHighlands, from the far coast of Aberdeenshire to the Mull of Cantyre,\r\nand across the west of Ireland from the headlands of Donegal into\r\nGalway, there occurs abundant evidence of the existence of rocks which,\r\nthough now forming an integral part of the schists, can be paralleled\r\nwith masses of undoubtedly volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Section showing the position of Sills in the\r\nmica-schist series between Loch Tay and Amulree.\r\n\r\n_a_, Mica-schist; _b_, _b_, Sills.]\r\n\r\nIntercalated in the vast pile of altered sediments lie numerous sheets\r\nof epidiorite and hornblende-schist, which were erupted as molten\r\nmaterials, not improbably as varieties of diabase-lava. Most of these\r\nsheets are doubtless intrusive \"sills,\" for they can be observed to\r\nbreak across from one horizon to another. But some of them may possibly\r\nbe contemporaneous lava-streams. A sheet may sometimes be followed\r\nfor many miles, occupying the same stratigraphical platform. Thus a\r\nband of sills may be traced from the coast of Banffshire to near Ben\r\nLedi, a distance of more than 100 miles. Among the hornblendic sills\r\nof this band some occur on a number of horizons between the group of\r\nBen Voirlich grits and the Ben-y-Glo quartzite. One of the most marked\r\nof these is a sheet, sometimes 200 feet thick, which underlies the\r\nLoch Tay Limestone. Another interesting group in the same great band\r\nhas been mapped by the Geological Survey on the hills between Loch Tay\r\nand Amulree, some of them being traceable for several miles among the\r\nmica-schists with which they alternate (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\nIn Argyllshire also, between Loch Tarbert and Loch Awe, and along the\r\neastern coasts of the islands of Islay and Jura, an abundant series of\r\nsheets of epidiorite, amphibolite and hornblende-schist runs with the\r\nprevalent strike of the schists, grits and limestones of that region.\r\nSimilar rocks reappear in a like position in Donegal, where, as in\r\nScotland, the frequency of the occurrence of these eruptive rocks on\r\nthe horizons of the limestones is worthy of remark. The persistence,\r\nnumber and aggregate thickness of the sills in this great band mark it\r\nout as the most extensive series of intrusive sheets in the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sills there occur also bosses of similar material,\r\nwhich in their form and their obvious relation to the sheets recall the\r\nstructure of volcanic necks. They consist of hornblendic rocks, like\r\nthe sills, but are usually tolerably massive, and show much less trace\r\nof superinduced foliation.\r\n\r\nBesides the obviously eruptive masses there is another abundant\r\ngroup of rocks which, I believe, furnishes important evidence as\r\nto contemporaneous volcanic action during the accumulation of the\r\nDalradian series. Throughout the Central and South-Western Highlands\r\ncertain zones of \"green schist\" have long occupied the attention of\r\nthe officers of the Geological Survey. They occur more especially on\r\ntwo horizons between the Loch Tay Limestone and a much lower series\r\nof grits and fine conglomerates, which run through the Trossachs and\r\nform the craggy ridges of Ben Ledi, Ben Voirlich and other mountains\r\nnear the Highland border. In the lower group of \"green schists,\" thick\r\nhornblendic sills begin to make their appearance, increasing in number\r\nupwards. The upper group of \"green schists\" lies between two bands of\r\ngarnetiferous mica-schist, above the higher of which comes the Loch\r\nTay Limestone. The peculiar greenish tint and corresponding mineral\r\nconstituents of these schists, however, are likewise found diffused\r\nthrough higher parts of the series.\r\n\r\nSo much do the \"green schists\" vary in structure and composition that\r\nno single definition of them is always applicable. At one extreme\r\nare dull green chlorite-schists, passing into a \"potstone,\" which,\r\nlike that of Trondhjem, can be cut into blocks for architectural\r\npurposes.[62] At the other extreme lie grits and quartzites, with a\r\nslight admixture of the same greenish-coloured constituent. Between\r\nthese limits almost every stage may be met with, the proportion of\r\nchlorite or hornblende and of granular or pebbly quartz varying\r\ncontinually, not only vertically, but even in the extension of the same\r\nbed. The quartz-pebbles are sometimes opalescent, and occasionally\r\nlarger than peas. An average specimen from one of the zones of \"green\r\nschists\" is found, on closer examination, to be a thoroughly schistose\r\nrock, composed of a matrix of granular quartz, through which acicular\r\nhornblende and biotite crystals, or actinolite and chlorite, are ranged\r\nalong the planes of foliation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: From such a rock, which crosses the upper part of Loch\r\nFyne, the Duke of Argyll's residence at Inveraray has been built.]\r\n\r\nThat these rocks are essentially of detrital origin admits of no\r\ndoubt. They differ, however, from the other sedimentary members of the\r\nDalradian series in the persistence and abundance of the magnesian\r\nsilicates diffused through them. The idea which they suggested to my\r\nmind some years ago was that the green colouring-matter represents fine\r\nbasic volcanic dust, which was showered out during the accumulation of\r\nordinary quartzose, argillaceous and calcareous sediments, and that,\r\nunder the influence of the metamorphism which has so greatly affected\r\nall the rocks of the region, the original pyroxenes and felspars\r\nsuffered the usual conversion into hornblendes, chlorites and micas.\r\nThis view has occurred also to my colleagues on the Survey, and is now\r\ngenerally adopted by them.\r\n\r\nNot only are these \"green schists\" traceable all through the Central\r\nand South-Western Highlands, rocks of similar character, and not\r\nimprobably on the same horizons, reappear in the north-west of Ireland,\r\nand run thence south-westward as far as the Dalradian rocks extend.\r\nIf we are justified in regarding them as metamorphosed tuffs and\r\nashy sediments, they mark a widespread and long-continued volcanic\r\nperiod during the time when the later half of the Dalradian series was\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nBesides the extensive development of basic sills which, though probably\r\nin great part later than the \"green schists,\" may belong to the same\r\nprolonged period of subterranean activity, numerous acid protrusions\r\nare to be observed in the Dalradian series of Scotland and Ireland.\r\nThat these masses were erupted at several widely-separated intervals\r\nis well shown by their relation to the schists among which they occur.\r\nSome of the great bosses and sills of granite were undoubtedly injected\r\nbefore the metamorphism of the schists was completed, for they have\r\nshared in the foliation of the region. Others have certainly appeared\r\nafter the metamorphism was complete, for they show no trace of having\r\nsuffered from its effects. Thus some of the vast tracts of newer\r\ngranite in the Grampian chain, which cover many square miles of ground,\r\nmust be among the newest rocks of that area. They have recently been\r\nfound by Mr. G. Barrow, of the Geological Survey, to send veins into\r\nthe belt of probably Lower Silurian strata which flanks the Highland\r\nschists. They are thus later than the Arenig period. Not impossibly\r\nthey may be referable to the great granite intrusions which formed so\r\nstriking a feature in the history of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. THE GNEISSES AND SCHISTS OF ANGLESEY\r\n\r\nIn the island of Anglesey an interesting series of schists and\r\nquartzites presents many points of resemblance to the Dalradian or\r\nyounger schists of the Highlands. At present the geologist possesses\r\nno means of determining whether these Welsh rocks are the equivalents\r\nof the Scottish in stratigraphical position, but their remarkable\r\nsimilarity justifies a brief allusion to them in this place. Much\r\ncontroversy has arisen regarding the geology of Anglesey, but into\r\nthis dispute it is not necessary for my present purpose to enter.[63]\r\nI will content myself with expressing what seems to me, after several\r\ntraverses, to be the geological structure of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: The literature of Anglesey geology is now somewhat\r\nvoluminous, but I may refer to the following as the chief authorities.\r\nThe island is mapped in Sheet 78 of the Geological Survey of England\r\nand Wales, and its structure is illustrated in Horizontal Sections,\r\nSheet 40. A full account of its various formations and of their\r\nrelations to each other is given in vol. iii. of the _Memoirs of the\r\nGeological Survey_, \"The Geology of North Wales,\" by Sir A. C. Ramsay,\r\n2nd edit. 1881. The subject has been discussed by Professor Hughes,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xxxiv. (1878) p. 137, xxxv. (1879) p.\r\n682, xxxvi. (1880) p. 237, xxxviii. (1882) p. 16; _Brit. Assoc. Rep._\r\n(1881) pp. 643, 644; _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._ vol. iii. pp. 67, 89,\r\n341; by Professor Bonney, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxv.

Soc._ vol. xliv.\r\n(1888) p. 463. Further references to the work of these observers in\r\nAnglesey are given in Chapter xiii. p. 220 _et seq._ The Pre-Cambrian\r\nareas of Anglesey are shown in Map II.]\r\n\r\nThere are two groups of rocks in Anglesey to which a pre-Cambrian age\r\nmay with probability be assigned. In the heart of the island lies a\r\ncore of gneiss which, if petrographical characters may be taken as\r\na guide, must certainly be looked upon as Archæan. In visiting that\r\ndistrict with my colleague Mr. Teall I was much astonished to find\r\nthere so striking a counterpart to portions of the Lewisian gneiss of\r\nthe north-west of Sutherland and Ross. The very external features of\r\nthe ground recall the peculiar hummocky surface which so persistently\r\ncharacterizes the areas of this rock throughout the north-west of\r\nScotland. If the geologist could be suddenly transported from the\r\nrounded rocky knolls of Sutherland, Ross-shire or the Hebrides to those\r\nin the middle of Anglesey, south of Llanerchymedd, he would hardly be\r\naware of the change, save in the greater verdure of the hollows, which\r\nhas resulted from a more advanced state of decomposition of the rocks\r\nat the surface, as well as from a better climate and agriculture.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine these rocky hummocks in detail we find them to consist\r\nof coarse gneisses, the foliation of which has a prevalent dip to\r\nN.N.W. Some portions abound in dark hornblende and garnets, others are\r\nrich in brown mica, the folia being coarsely crystalline and rudely\r\nbanded, as in the more massive gneisses of Sutherland. Abundant veins\r\nof coarse pegmatite may here and there be seen, with pinkish and white\r\nfelspars and milky quartz. Occasionally the gneiss is traversed by\r\nbands of a dark greenish-grey rock, which remind one of the dykes\r\nof the north-west of Scotland. There are other rocks, some of them\r\nprobably intrusive and of later date, to be seen in the same area; but\r\nthey require more detailed study than they have yet received.\r\n\r\nThe relation of this core of gneiss and its associated rocks to the\r\nsecond group of pre-Cambrian rocks has not hitherto been satisfactorily\r\nascertained. The core may conceivably be an eruptive boss in that\r\ngroup, and may have acquired its foliation during the movements that\r\nproduced the foliation of the surrounding schists. But it seems more\r\nprobable that the gneiss is much older than these schists, though\r\nit would undoubtedly participate in the effects of the mechanical\r\nmovements which gave rise to their deformation, cleavage and foliation.\r\n\r\nThe second group of rocks occupies a large area in the west and in the\r\ncentre and south of Anglesey. The schists of which it consists are\r\nobviously in the main a clastic series. One of their most conspicuous\r\nmembers is quartzite, which, besides occurring sporadically all over\r\nthe island, forms the prominent mass of Holyhead Mountain. There\r\nare likewise flaggy chloritic schists, green and purple phyllites\r\nor slates, and bands of grit, while parts of the so-called \"grey\r\ngneiss\" consist of pebbly sandstones that have acquired a crystalline\r\nstructure. That some order of sequence among these various strata may\r\nyet be worked out is not impossible, but the task will be one of no\r\nordinary difficulty, for the plications and fractures are numerous,\r\nand much of the surface of the ground is obscured by the spread of\r\nPalæozoic formations and superficial deposits.\r\n\r\nThese Anglesey schists are so obviously an altered sedimentary series\r\nthat it is not surprising that they should have been regarded as\r\nmetamorphosed Cambrian strata. All that can be positively affirmed\r\nregarding their age is that they are not only older than the lowest\r\nfossiliferous rocks around them--that is, than Arenig or even Tremadoc\r\nstrata--but that they had already acquired their present metamorphic\r\ncharacter before these strata were laid down unconformably upon them.\r\nThere is no actual proof that they include no altered Cambrian rocks.\r\nBut when we consider their distinctly crystalline structure, and the\r\nabsence of such a structure from any portion of the Cambrian areas\r\nof the mainland; when, moreover, we reflect that the metamorphism\r\nwhich has affected them is of the regional type, and can hardly have\r\nbeen restricted to merely the limited area of Anglesey; we must agree\r\nwith those observers who, in spite of the absence of positive proof\r\nof their true geological horizon, have regarded these rocks as of\r\nmuch higher antiquity than the Cambrian strata of the neighbourhood.\r\nNo one familiar with the Dalradian rocks of Scotland and Ireland can\r\nfail to be struck with the close resemblance which these younger\r\nAnglesey schists bear to them, down even into the minutest details.\r\nPetrographically they are precisely the counterparts of the quartzites\r\nand schists of Perthshire and Donegal, and a further connection may be\r\nestablished of a palæontological kind. The upper part of the Holyhead\r\nquartzite was found by Mr. B. N. Peach and myself in the autumn of\r\nthe year 1890 to be at one place crowded with annelid-pipes, and I\r\nsubsequently found the same to be the case with some of the flaggy\r\nquartzites near the South Stack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Sketch of crushed basic igneous rock among the\r\nschists, E. side of Porth-tywyn-mawr, E. side of Holyhead Straits.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the inquiry which forms the theme of this work, the\r\nfeature of greatest interest about these younger schists of Anglesey is\r\nthe association of igneous rocks with them. They include bands of dark\r\nbasic material, the less crushed parts of which resemble the diabases\r\nof later formations, while the sheared portions pass into epidiorites\r\nand true hornblende-schists. As in other regions where eruptive rocks\r\nhave been crushed down and changed into the schistose modification,\r\nit is frequently possible to see groups of uncrushed cores round\r\nwhich, under severe mechanical stresses, the rock has undergone this\r\nconversion. Lines of movement through the body of the rock may be\r\ndetected by bands of schist, the gradation from the solid core to the\r\nhornblende-schist being quite gradual. The accompanying figure (Fig.\r\n38) represents a portion of one of these crushed basic igneous rocks on\r\nthe east side of Holyhead Straits.\r\n\r\nAs in the Dalradian series of the Highlands, many, perhaps most, of\r\nthese igneous bands are probably intrusive sills, but others may be\r\nintercalated contemporaneous sheets. They occur across the whole\r\nbreadth of the island from the Menai Strait to the shores of Holyhead.\r\n\r\nBesides these undoubtedly igneous rocks, the green chloritic slates\r\nof Anglesey deserve notice. They are well-bedded strata, consisting\r\nof alternations of foliated fine grit or sandstone, with layers more\r\nlargely made up of schistose chlorite. The gritty bands sometimes\r\ncontain pebbles of blue quartz, and evidently represent original layers\r\nof sandy sediment, but with an admixture of chloritic material. The\r\nmanner in which this green chloritic constituent is diffused through\r\nthe whole succession of strata, and likewise aggregated into bands with\r\ncomparatively little quartzose sediment, reminds one of the \"green\r\nschists\" of the Central Highlands and Donegal, and suggests a similar\r\nexplanation. Taken in connection with the associated basic igneous\r\nrocks, these chloritic schists seem to me to represent a thick group\r\nof volcanic tuffs and interstratified sandy and clayey layers. If this\r\ninference is well founded, and if we are justified in grouping these\r\nAnglesey rocks with the Dalradian schists of Scotland and Ireland,\r\na striking picture is presented to the mind of the wide extent and\r\npersistent activity of the volcanoes of that primeval period in\r\nBritain.[64]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Mr. E. Greenly, late of the Geological Survey of\r\nScotland, has recently established himself on the Menai Strait for\r\nthe purpose of working out in detail the geological structure of this\r\ninteresting and complicated region. We may therefore hope that some of\r\nthe still unsolved problems presented by the rocks of Anglesey will\r\nbefore long be satisfactorily explained.]\r\n\r\n\r\niv. THE URICONIAN VOLCANOES\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern borders of Wales a ridge of ancient rocks, much\r\nbroken by faults and presenting several striking unconformabilities,\r\nhas long been classic ground in geology from the descriptions and\r\nillustrations of Murchison's _Silurian System_.[65] The main outlines\r\nof the structure of that district, first admirably worked out by\r\nthis great pioneer, were delineated on the maps and sections of\r\nthe Geological Survey, wherein it was shown that in the Longmynd\r\nan enormously thick group of stratified rocks, which, though\r\nunfossiliferous, were referred to the Cambrian system, rose in the very\r\nheart of the country; that to the east of these rocks lay strata of\r\nCaradoc or Bala age; that by a great hiatus in the stratigraphy the\r\nUpper Silurian series transgressively wrapped round everything below\r\nit; that yet again the Coal-measures crept over all these various\r\nPalæozoic formations, followed once more unconformably by Permian and\r\nTriassic deposits.[66] Besides all this evidence of extraordinary\r\nand repeated terrestrial movement, it was found that the region was\r\ntraversed by some of the most powerful dislocations in this country,\r\nwhile to complete the picture of disturbance, many protrusions of\r\nigneous rocks were recognized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: See especially chap. xix. vol. i. p. 225.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The area is embraced in Sheet 61 of the Geological\r\nSurvey, and is illustrated by Nos. 33 and 36 of the sheets of\r\nHorizontal Sections. In the early editions of the Survey maps the\r\n\"felspathic traps\" and the \"greenstones\" of the Wrekin district were\r\ndistinguished by separate colours, but unfortunately this useful and so\r\nfar correct discrimination was given up in subsequent editions, where\r\nall the acid and basic rocks are merged into one.]\r\n\r\nIn a territory so complicated, though it had been sedulously and\r\nskilfully explored, there could hardly fail to remain features of\r\nstructure which had escaped the notice of the first observers. In\r\nparticular, the igneous rocks had been dealt with only in a general\r\nway, and they consequently offered a favourable field for more detailed\r\nstudy; while by a more searching examination of some of the rocks for\r\nfossils, important corrections of the earlier work might yet be made.\r\n\r\nA notable step towards a revision of the received opinions regarding\r\nthe igneous rocks of this region was taken by Mr. Allport, who showed\r\nthat the so-called \"greenstone\" included masses of devitrified\r\nspherulitic pitchstones and perlites, together with indurated volcanic\r\nbreccias, agglomerates and ashes.[67] Subsequently Professor Bonney\r\ndescribed more fully the petrographical characters of the Wrekin\r\nigneous rocks, confirming and extending the observations of Mr.\r\nAllport.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxiii. (1877) p. 449.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Op. cit._ vol. xxxv. (1879) p. 662; vol. xxxviii. (1882)\r\np. 124.]\r\n\r\nBut the correction of the prevalent error as to the geological age of\r\nthese rocks was due to Dr. Callaway, who, after spending much time and\r\nlabour in ascertaining, by a careful search for fossils, the position\r\nof the superincumbent rocks (wherein he discovered Cambrian organisms),\r\nand in a detailed investigation of the structure and relationships of\r\nthe igneous masses themselves, was led to regard them as part of an\r\nancient pre-Cambrian ridge; and he proposed for the volcanic group\r\nthe name of Uriconian, from the name of the former Roman town which\r\nstood not far to the west of them.[69] He has shown how essentially\r\nvolcanic this ancient series of rocks is, how seldom they present\r\nany clearly-marked evidence of stratification, and how small is the\r\nproportion of sedimentary material associated with them.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xxx. (1874) p. 196,\r\nxxxiv. (1878) p. 754, xxxv. (1879) p. 643, xlii. (1886) p. 481. For a\r\ncriticism of Dr. Callaway's views as to the order of succession among\r\nthe rocks of this district, see Prof. Blake, _op. cit._ vol. xlvi.\r\n(1890) p. 386, and Dr. Callaway's reply, vol. xlvii. (1891) p. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Op. cit._ vol. xlvii. (1891) p. 123.]\r\n\r\nSubsequently Professor Lapworth, by his discovery of the\r\n_Olenellus_-fauna, marking the lowest known fossiliferous Cambrian\r\nzone in the Wrekin district, and his recognition of Cambrian fossils\r\nunder the Coal-measures of Warwickshire, supplied valuable evidence for\r\nthe discussion of the geological position of the older rocks of the\r\nMidlands. He has mapped in minute detail the rocks of the Wrekin, and\r\nhas exhausted all the evidence that is at present obtainable on the\r\nsubject. But unfortunately the publication of his researches is still\r\ndelayed.[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Geol. Mag._ (1882) p. 563, (1886) p. 319, (1887) p. 78,\r\n(1888) p. 484; and a joint paper with Mr. W. W. Watts on the Geology of\r\nSouth Shropshire, _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ vol. xiii. (1894) pp. 302, 335.]\r\n\r\nIt is now recognized that the core of the ancient ridge, extending\r\nfrom near Wellington through the Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and other hills,\r\nuntil it sinks beneath the Upper Silurian formations, is formed of\r\nigneous rocks that consist partly of lavas, partly of volcanic breccias\r\nand fine tuffs. The lavas are thoroughly acid rocks of the felsitic\r\nor rhyolitic type. One of them, about 100 feet thick, which forms\r\na prominent feature on the flanks and crest of Caer Caradoc, shows\r\nabundant finely-banded flow-structure, often curved or on end, while\r\nits bottom and upper parts are strongly amygdaloidal, the cavities\r\nbeing occasionally pulled out in the direction of flow and lined with\r\nquartz or chalcedony. Some of the detached areas of eruptive rocks show\r\nthe beautiful spherulitic and perlitic structures first noticed in this\r\nregion by Mr. Allport. More recently the structures of these acid rocks\r\nhave been described by Mr. F. Rutley.[72]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvii. (1891) p. 540. Mr.\r\nRutley more particularly describes those of Caradoc Hill.]\r\n\r\nThe breccias and tuffs appear to consist mainly of felsitic material.\r\nIn the coarser varieties, fragments of finely-banded felsite may\r\nbe noticed, while the finer kinds pass into a kind of hornstone\r\n(hälleflinta), which in hand-specimens could hardly be distinguished\r\nfrom close-grained felsite. In some places, these pyroclastic rocks\r\nare well stratified, but elsewhere no satisfactory bedding can be\r\nrecognized in them. Various other rocks, which are probably intrusive,\r\noccur in the ridge. At either end of the Wrekin there is a mass of pink\r\nmicrogranite, while at Caer Caradoc numerous sheets of \"greenstone,\"\r\nintercalated in the fine tuffs, sweep across the hill. Mr. Rutley\r\nhas published an account of these basic rocks, which he classes as\r\n\"melaphyres,\" or altered forms of basalt or andesite.[73] That at least\r\nsome of them are intrusive is manifest by the way in which they ramify\r\nthrough the surrounding strata. But others are so strongly amygdaloidal\r\nand slaggy that they may possibly be true interbedded lavas, though\r\nthere may be some hesitation in admitting that such basic outflows\r\ncould be erupted in the midst of thoroughly acid ejections.[74] Leaving\r\nthese doubtful flows out of account, we have here a group of undoubted\r\nvolcanic rocks represented by acid lavas and pyroclastic materials,\r\nby intrusive bosses of acid rocks, and by younger basic sills. The\r\ngeneral lithological characters of these masses and the sequence of\r\ntheir appearance thus strongly resemble those of subsequent Palæozoic\r\nvolcanic episodes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _Op. cit._ p. 534.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: This difficulty, however, need not be in itself\r\ninsuperable, as is evident from the remarkable alternation of basic and\r\nacid lavas and tuffs in the Cambrian volcanic group of St. David's and\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone series of the Pentland Hills.]\r\n\r\nThe geological age of this volcanic group is a question of much\r\ninterest and importance in regard to the history of volcanism in this\r\ncountry. An inferior limit to the antiquity of the group can at once be\r\nfixed by the fact that, as originally pointed out by Dr. Callaway, the\r\nquartzite which overlies the volcanic rocks passes under a limestone\r\ncontaining Cambrian fossils in which Professor Lapworth has since\r\nrecognized _Olenellus_, _Paradoxides_ and other Lower Cambrian forms.\r\nThe eruptions, therefore, must be at least as old as the earlier part\r\nof the Cambrian period. But it is affirmed that the quartzite rests\r\nwith a complete unconformability on the volcanic rocks. If this be so,\r\nthen the epoch of eruption must be shifted much farther back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Section across the Uriconian series of Caer\r\nCaradoc.\r\n\r\nS3, Upper Silurian; S2, Bala group; S1, Arenig group; C, Cambrian; L,\r\nLongmyndian; _u_, Uriconian; _f_ _f_, faults.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced in favour of this great break appears to me to be\r\nthreefold. In the first place, the quartzite contains fragments of the\r\nvolcanic rocks. I do not think much stress can be laid on this fact.\r\nWhen I visited the ground, what struck me most in the composition of\r\nthe quartzite was its singularly pure quartzose character, and the\r\ncomparative scarcity of felsite-pebbles in it. Any deposit laid down\r\nconformably upon the top of the breccias and tuffs might obviously\r\ncontain some of these materials, while, if laid down unconformably, it\r\nmight reasonably be expected to be full of them. In the second place,\r\nthis quartzite is alleged to pass transgressively across the edges\r\nof successive sheets of the volcanic group, and thus to have a quite\r\ndiscordant dip and strike. I failed to find satisfactory evidence of\r\nthis unconformability in the northern part of the district. But in\r\nthe Caer Caradoc area the quartzite does appear to steal across the\r\noutcrops of the older rocks, which plunge at nearly right angles in an\r\nopposite direction. In the third place, the felsitic volcanic group is\r\nbelieved by Professor Lapworth to pass upwards into the Longmynd rocks.\r\nObviously, if this group lies at the very bottom of the vast Longmynd\r\nseries, the discordance between it and the quartzite must be enormous,\r\nand the date of the volcanic eruptions must be placed vastly farther\r\nback in geological antiquity. Though the evidence does not seem to me\r\nto amount to clear proof, I am disposed, in the meantime, to accept it\r\nas affording the most probable solution of the difficulties presented\r\nby the structure of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the rocks around Caer Caradoc is partly concealed by\r\nsurface accumulations, but if these could be cleared away the structure\r\nof the ground would be, according to Messrs. Lapworth and Watts, as\r\nshown in Fig. 39.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ vol. xiii. (1894), pp. 314, 315.]\r\n\r\nIf, then, this volcanic group underlies the whole of the Longmynd\r\nseries, and if, as it now appears, that series is older than the\r\n_Olenellus_-zone of the Lower Cambrian rocks, we can hardly include the\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Wrekin and Caer Caradoc in the Cambrian system.\r\nThey must belong to a still older geological formation, and I think we\r\ncannot do better than adopt for them Dr. Callaway's name, Uriconian.\r\n\r\nThere are still, however, many problems to be solved before the\r\ngeological history of that region is completely understood. The rocks\r\nof the Longmynd must be more fully worked out. It is improbable that\r\nstrata which look so likely to yield fossils should for ever prove\r\nbarren. The lower half at least may be hopefully searched, although the\r\nupper massive reddish sandstones and conglomerates offer less prospect\r\nof success. On the west side of the Longmynd, above Pontesbury,\r\nthere occurs a small area of volcanic rocks like those of the Wrekin\r\ndistrict, including a well-marked nodular felsite and fine tuffs.\r\nThese rocks have been regarded by Dr. Callaway as another axis of the\r\nUriconian series. It is very difficult, however, by any combination\r\nof geological structures, to bring up a portion of the very bottom\r\nof the Longmynd series and place it apparently at the top. This is\r\na feat which a detailed study of the region, and the detection of\r\nunconformabilities in the Longmynd, may possibly accomplish. In the\r\nmeantime, however, I would venture to suggest whether it is not more\r\nprobable that we have here a detached area of much younger volcanic\r\nrocks, like those which, in various districts, may be included in\r\nthe Cambrian system, and which will be referred to in some detail in\r\nsubsequent pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE MALVERN VOLCANO\r\n\r\nRegarding the age and origin of the oldest rocks of the Malvern Hills\r\nsome controversy has arisen, and no general agreement has yet been\r\nreached.[76] It is clear that the core of crystalline rocks which\r\nis overlain unconformably by the Hollybush Sandstone must be older\r\nthan the Upper Cambrian rocks. There is no good evidence of any\r\nstratigraphical break in the Cambrian system of England or Wales, and\r\nit may be reasonably inferred that the break seen at the base of the\r\nHollybush Sandstones indicates that the rocks underneath that horizon\r\nare pre-Cambrian. Some portions of these certainly very ancient rocks\r\nare gneisses or schists; others have been described as \"felsites,\"\r\nand have been regarded as passing into schists, and as the original\r\nmaterial from which portions of the foliated series of the range\r\nhave been produced by mechanical deformation. Not improbably the\r\nwhole series of rocks is of igneous origin, but has been subsequently\r\nrendered more or less schistose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: There is no room here for a full bibliography of the\r\ngeological literature devoted to this locality. In the monograph by J.\r\nPhillips in vol. ii. part i. of the _Memoirs of the Geological Survey_,\r\na list of writings is given up to the time of its publication in 1848.\r\nSince that year many additional papers have appeared. I may especially\r\nrefer to H. B. Holl, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxi. (1865) p. 72; J.\r\nH. Timins, _op. cit._ xxii. (1867); Mr. F. Rutley, _op. cit._ xliii.\r\n(1887) p. 481; Dr. Callaway, _op. cit._ xliii. (1887) p. 525, xlv.\r\n(1889) p. 475, xlix. (1893) p. 398; Prof. Green, _op. cit._ li. (1895)\r\np. 1; Mr. H. D. Acland, _Geol. Mag._ 1894, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nThere is one area where the rocks have escaped metamorphism, and where\r\nthey present some of the well-known features of ancient volcanic\r\nmaterials. This tract was first indicated by Dr. H. B. Holl as one\r\noccupied by \"altered primordial rocks and post-primordial trap.\"\r\nIts evidently igneous materials have been examined and described by\r\ndifferent observers, among whom Dr. Callaway has contributed some\r\ndetailed papers on the subject. More recently Professor Green, who\r\nhad the advantage of sections exposed in the excavations for the\r\nconstruction of a reservoir for supplying water to Great Malvern, came\r\nto the conclusion that the rocks consist mainly of felsites, having\r\nmany of the characters of rhyolites. With these are associated felsitic\r\ntuffs, while bands of dolerite, probably intrusive, form likewise\r\npart of the series. So far as the somewhat meagre evidence allows an\r\nopinion to be formed, there appears to be an alternation of felsites,\r\nlavas and tuffs placed in a more or less vertical position, striking\r\nin a northerly direction, and traversed by several sheets of intrusive\r\ndolerite.\r\n\r\nNo junction has been found between these unfoliated volcanic rocks and\r\nthe schists that form the core of the range. Judging merely from their\r\npresent relative condition, one would naturally infer that the volcanic\r\nrocks must be the younger of the two groups. But, as Professor Green\r\nhas pointed out, it is conceivable that the latter may have locally\r\nescaped crushing, and yet be of the same age as the felsites and\r\nepidiorites of the neighbouring Raggedstone Hill, which have been in\r\npart considerably affected by mechanical movements.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Op. cit._ p. 7. The metamorphism of the igneous rocks of\r\nthe Malvern Hills into schists has been especially investigated by Dr.\r\nCallaway.]\r\n\r\nFor our present inquiry it is perhaps sufficient to take note that\r\nin the heart of the Malvern Hills there lies a remnant of a volcanic\r\ndistrict, probably of pre-Cambrian age, the rocks of which had been\r\nraised up into a vertical position so as to form islets or reefs in the\r\nsea in which the Upper Cambrian strata (Hollybush Sandstone and Upper\r\nLingula shales) were deposited. Until some more precise evidence is\r\nobtained as to the geological age of these rocks it may be convenient\r\nto place them provisionally with the volcanic Uriconian series.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. THE CHARNWOOD FOREST VOLCANO\r\n\r\nIn the heart of England the great Triassic plain is diversified by\r\nthe uprise through it of the peaks and crests of an old Triassic\r\nland-surface, which are embraced in the district known as Charnwood\r\nForest. These scattered eminences consist of materials not only\r\nimmensely older than the Trias, but once doubtless buried under\r\nthousands of feet of Palæozoic strata. They had been laid bare by\r\ndenudation and carved into picturesque crags and pinnacles before the\r\nNew Red Sandstone was deposited around and above them.\r\n\r\nTo these vestiges of an early Mesozoic land, still half buried among\r\nTriassic strata, a peculiar interest attaches from the obviously high\r\nantiquity of their rocks and their uprise in the very centre of the\r\nisland. Various opinions have been expressed as to the age of their\r\ncomponent rocks. When they were mapped by the Geological Survey they\r\nwere recognized to be as old as any group of rocks then known, and they\r\nwere accordingly placed in the Cambrian system. More recent research\r\nhas suggested that they may be still more ancient, and may be regarded\r\nas pre-Cambrian.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Charnwood Forest have been the subject of an exhaustive\r\nresearch by the Rev. E. Hill and Professor Bonney, to whom most of our\r\nknowledge regarding them is due. These observers first pointed out the\r\ntruly volcanic nature of the coarse clastic rocks of the district.\r\nThey have traced their relations in the field, and have likewise\r\ndescribed their structure and composition as shown by the microscope.\r\nSubsequently the district has been re-mapped on the scale of six\r\ninches to a mile by Mr. Fox Strangways for the Geological Survey,\r\nwhile Mr. W. W. Watts, another member of the Survey, has studied the\r\npetrography of the ground, and has traced the boundaries of the several\r\nrock-groups so far as these can be determined. Confirming generally the\r\nstratigraphical arrangement sketched by Messrs. Hill and Bonney, Mr.\r\nWatts has proposed the following classification of the rocks:--[78]\r\n\r\n  7. Groby and Swithland slates.         }\r\n                                         }\r\n  6. Hanging Rocks conglomerate and      } The Brand series.\r\n       Bradgate quartzite.               }\r\n\r\n  5. Woodhouse beds (ashy grits).        }\r\n                                         }\r\n  4. Slate-agglomerate of Roecliffe.     } The Maplewell series (volcanic\r\n                                         }   tuffs and agglomerates).\r\n  3. Hornstone beds of Beacon Hill.      }\r\n                                         }\r\n  2. Felsitic agglomerate of Benscliffe. }\r\n\r\n  1. Quartzose, felspathic and felsitic grits. The Blackbrook series.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Annual Report of Director-General of the Geological\r\nSurvey, in the _Report of Science and Art Department for 1895_.]\r\n\r\nUnder any computation or measurement, the total thickness of detrital\r\nmaterial in this series of formations must amount to several thousand\r\nfeet. The chief interest centres in the middle series, which consists\r\nlargely of fragmental volcanic rocks, with intercalations of slate\r\nand grit. As was first shown by Mr. Hill and Professor Bonney, these\r\nvolcanic materials vary from exceedingly coarse agglomerates to fine,\r\nashy or felspathic slates. In most cases distinct bedding can be\r\nrecognized in them, but more particularly in the fine-grained material.\r\nYet even among the massive agglomerates a tendency may be seen towards\r\nan orientation of the blocks with their long axes parallel. That\r\nthis arrangement is not entirely due to the effects of cleavage may\r\nbe inferred from the many exceptions to it, which would hardly have\r\noccurred had such powerful cleavage affected the whole district, as\r\nwould be needed to rearrange the large blocks in the agglomerates.\r\nBesides, the coarser parts often intercalate with fine felspathic\r\ngrits, which distinctly mark the stratification of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe remarkably coarse breccia of Benscliffe is mainly made up of blocks\r\nof quartz-porphyry, felsite or rhyolite, with slate fragments. The\r\nRoecliffe agglomerate, another extraordinarily coarse rock, consists\r\nof slate fragments imbedded in an andesitic matrix, some of the blocks\r\nof slate being six feet long. The finer tuffs have been ascertained\r\nto consist of felsitic or andesitic detritus, sometimes forming\r\nexceedingly compact flinty rocks or hornstones.\r\n\r\nIn this thick accumulation of detrital rocks we are presented with\r\na series of alternations of coarser and finer pyroclastic material,\r\ninterstratified among green, grey and purple slates and grits, which\r\nprobably represent the non-volcanic sediments of the time of eruption.\r\nThe succession of strata bears witness to a long series of eruptions\r\nof varying intensity, but culminating at two distinct periods in\r\nthe discharge of huge blocks of rock (Benscliffe and Roecliffe\r\nagglomerates).\r\n\r\nAfter some search I have been unable to detect a single vesicular\r\nfragment among the stones in the breccias and tuffs, and Messrs. Hill\r\nand Bonney were not more successful. Not a trace of anything in the\r\nleast degree scoriaceous is anywhere to be found. The paste in which\r\nthe blocks lie consists of such fine material as would result from the\r\ntrituration of felsite and slate. It contains many broken crystals of\r\nfelspar, with grains of clear quartz. A gradation can be traced from\r\nthe coarser into the finer bands of volcanic and non-volcanic material,\r\nfine slates being also interleaved with highly-felspathic partings of\r\ngrit.\r\n\r\nHaving looked with some care for a trace of a true volcanic neck in\r\nthe district, I have not seen anything that could be unhesitatingly so\r\ndesignated. Even in the north-western part of the district, where the\r\nbreccias are coarsest, and there is least trace of ordinary sediments,\r\nsome signs of bedding can usually be detected in the position of the\r\nimbedded stones and the partings of finer tuff. Both the coarser and\r\nfiner detritus suggest the kind of material discharged from vents\r\nbefore the uprise of any lava. The entire absence of scoriaceous\r\nfragments is noteworthy, and the abundance of slate blocks rather\r\npoints to the early eruptions of a volcanic focus. Possibly, while the\r\nchief centre of eruption lay towards the north-west, numerous vents may\r\nhave been opened all over the district, discharging abundant showers\r\nof dust and stones, but seldom or never culminating in the actual\r\noutpouring of lava.\r\n\r\nNo indubitable lava-sheet has, in my judgment, been yet recognized in\r\nCharnwood Forest. Various opinions have been expressed as to some of\r\nthe more compact close-grained rocks, and even the verdicts of the same\r\nobservers have varied from time to time, the rocks once considered as\r\nfelsites being afterwards regarded as tuffs, and subsequently placed\r\nwith the felsites or andesites after all. It is not necessary for my\r\npresent purpose to enter into these questions, which are rather of\r\nlocal interest. I will only say that, in my opinion, the rocks of\r\nSharpley, Peldar, and Bardon Hill are massive rocks, as they have\r\nfinally been classed by Messrs. Hill and Bonney. But I cannot look upon\r\nthem as lavas, at least I have seen no evidence to lead me to believe\r\nthat they were ever erupted at the surface. I have fully considered\r\nthe arguments of Mr. Hill and Professor Bonney on this point.[79]\r\nThere can, I think, be no doubt of the close association of these\r\nfelsitic rocks and the breccias, but the structure of the rocks in\r\nthe field seems to me to be decidedly in favour of the view expressed\r\nabove. The microscope affords no assistance in the question.[80] The\r\ndoubtful rocks seem to me rather to be intrusive masses which have\r\nbeen protruded into the volcanic sedimentary series among which they\r\nrise. They are acid, fine-grained, porphyritic rocks, which would\r\nformerly have been included under the general name of felsites or\r\nquartz-porphyries. Their coarse porphyritic parts rapidly pass into\r\nclose-grained felsitic material. Many of the blocks in the breccias are\r\nprecisely like parts of these rocks. It might hence be asserted that\r\nthese fragmental deposits are later than the eruptive bosses. At least\r\nit is obvious that rocks of the same type as those of Sharpley, Peldar,\r\nand Bardon Hill must have been disrupted to produce the coarse breccias.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891), pp. 80-88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: See Messrs. Hill and Bonney, _op. cit._ xxxiv. (1878), p.\r\n211.]\r\n\r\nLater eruptive rocks, consisting of masses of syenite and granite, with\r\nstill younger dykes of dolerite, andesite, diorite and felsite, have\r\nsuccessively made their appearance, and add to the diversity of the\r\nigneous phenomena of this district.\r\n\r\nThe question of the age of this isolated volcanic series is one of\r\nmuch interest, but of great perplexity. Though a resemblance may be\r\nadmitted to exist between some of the slates and parts of the Cambrian\r\nsystem of North Wales, the difference between the Charnwood rocks and\r\nthe undoubted Cambrian series of Warwickshire, only thirteen miles to\r\nthe south-west, is such as to indicate that the former are probably\r\nolder than the latter. While the Charnwood rocks have been intensely\r\ncleaved and crushed, those of Warwickshire have undergone no such\r\nchange. The argillaceous strata in the one region have been converted\r\ninto slates, in the other they remain mere shales. Though cleavage is\r\nsometimes irregularly developed, its rapid disappearance in so short a\r\ndistance as the interval between Charnwood Forest and Nuneaton seems\r\nmost explicable if we suppose that the rocks at the more easterly\r\nlocality were cleaved before those towards the west were deposited. If\r\nthis inference be well grounded the pre-Cambrian age of the Charnwood\r\nvolcanoes would be established. But the argument is not conclusive.\r\nNo fossils of any kind have yet been found in any of the old rocks of\r\nCharnwood.[81] Merely lithological resemblances or differences are all\r\nthat can be used as a guide to the geological age of these masses.\r\nMr. Watts has suggested that possibly the quartzite of Bradgate (No.\r\n6 of the Charnwood groups) may be the equivalent of the quartzite\r\nwhich in Shropshire and Warwickshire forms the base of the sedimentary\r\nCambrian formations. If that correlation could be established, the\r\nvolcanic series below the quartzite in Charnwood might be regarded as\r\nrepresenting the Uriconian volcanic series of Shropshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Since this page was in type, Professor Lapworth has found\r\na worm-burrow low down in the Brand Series, and one or two additional\r\nexamples have since been obtained by Mr. J.

From the bottom\r\nof the Cambrian system upward through the long series of geological\r\nformations, the chronicle, though often sadly incomplete, is usually\r\nclear and legible. As we follow the lowest fossiliferous strata across\r\na territory, we recognize that they bear witness to the same processes\r\nof denudation and deposition which have been going on uninterruptedly\r\non the face of the globe ever since. The beds of conglomerate represent\r\nthe gravels and shingles of old coast-lines and river-beds. The\r\nsandstones recall the familiar features of sandy sea-bottoms not far\r\nfrom land. The shales bear witness to the fall of fine sediment in\r\nstiller water, such as now takes place in the deeper parts of seas and\r\nlakes. Notwithstanding their vast antiquity, the strata themselves\r\nexhibit no exceptional peculiarities of origin. They seem to be just\r\nsuch familiar deposits as are gathering under fitting conditions at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nSome writers have speculated on the far greater intensity of all\r\ngeological activities in the early times of the planet's history. But\r\nif we may interpret the record of the stratified formations by the\r\nphenomena of to-day, there is for these speculations no confirmation in\r\nthe sedimentation of the oldest stratified deposits. It is of course\r\nquite intelligible, if not probable, that many geological forces\r\nmay have been more vigorous in primeval times than they afterwards\r\nbecame. But of the gigantic tides, prodigious denudation and violent\r\nhuddling together of the waste of the earth's surface, which have been\r\npostulated for the early Palæozoic ages, there is assuredly nowhere\r\nany indication among the stratified formations. In those vast orderly\r\nrepositories, layer succeeds layer among thinly-laminated shales, as\r\ngently and equably as the fine silt of each tide sinks to-day over the\r\nfloor of a sheltered estuary. At the primeval period of which these\r\nsediments are the memorial, the waters receded from flat shores and\r\nleft tracts of mud bare to the sky, precisely as they do still. Then as\r\nnow, the sun shone and dried such mud-flats, covering their surfaces\r\nwith a network of cracks; the rain fell in heavy drops, that left their\r\nimprints on the drying mud; and the next tide rose so gently as to\r\noverflow these records of sunshine and shower without effacing them,\r\nbut spreading over them a fresh film of sediment, to be succeeded by\r\nother slowly-accumulating layers, under which they have lain preserved\r\nduring the long cycles of geological history.\r\n\r\nThat organized creatures had already appeared upon the earth's surface\r\nbefore the beginning of the Cambrian period cannot be doubted. The\r\nanimal remains in the lowest Cambrian strata are far from being the\r\nsimple forms which might be expected to indicate the first start of\r\nanimal life upon the surface of the earth. On the contrary, though they\r\nare comparatively scanty in types, and often rare or absent throughout\r\na thick mass of sedimentary deposits, they show beyond dispute that,\r\nwhen they flourished, invertebrate life had already reached such a\r\nstage of advancement and differentiation that various leading types had\r\nappeared which have descended, in some cases with generic identity,\r\ndown to our own day. There must have been a long pedigree to these\r\norganisms of the oldest known fossiliferous rocks. And somewhere on\r\nthe earth's surface we may yet hope to find the remains of their\r\nprogenitors in pre-Cambrian deposits.\r\n\r\nThe researches of many explorers in Europe and North America have\r\nbrought to light an interesting series of organic remains from the\r\nCambrian system. Of the plants of the time hardly any traces have\r\nsurvived, save some markings which have been referred to sea-weeds. The\r\nearliest known sponges and corals occur in this system, likewise the\r\nancestors of the graptolites, which played so prominent a part in the\r\nlife of the next or Silurian period. There were already representatives\r\nof crinoids and star-fishes, besides examples of the extinct group of\r\ncystideans. Sea-worms crawled over the muddy and sandy sea-bottom, for\r\nthey have left their trails and burrows in the hardened sediments.\r\nMolluscs had by this time appeared in their four great divisions of\r\nBrachiopods, Lamellibranchs, Gasteropods and Cephalopods, though the\r\nforms yet discovered among Cambrian rocks are comparatively few. The\r\nmost abundant and characteristic inhabitants of the Cambrian seas were\r\nthe trilobites, of which many genera have been disinterred from the\r\nstrata. In the lowest fossiliferous Cambrian group the trilobitic genus\r\n_Olenellus_, already referred to, is the characteristic form. Higher\r\nup _Paradoxides_ is predominant, while towards the top of the system\r\nthe most characteristic genus is _Olenus_.\r\n\r\nFrom the organic remains which have been preserved, we may legitimately\r\ninfer the existence of others which have entirely disappeared. There\r\nseems no reason to doubt that the leading grades of invertebrate life\r\nwhich are wanting in the known Cambrian fauna were really represented\r\nin the Cambrian seas. The chance discovery of a band of limestone may\r\nany day entirely alter our knowledge as to the relative proportions\r\nof the several divisions of the animal kingdom in the earliest\r\nPalæozoic rocks. Sand is rather adverse to the preservation of a varied\r\nrepresentation of the organisms of the overlying sea-water. Mud is\r\ngenerally favourable, but calcareous accumulations are greatly more\r\nso, and they usually consist almost entirely of organic remains. Thus\r\nin the Cambrian series of the north-west of Scotland the quartzites\r\nthat form the lower group, though sometimes crowded with worm-burrows,\r\ncontain hardly any other sign of organisms. The overlying shales,\r\nbesides their abundant worm-castings, have yielded perfect specimens of\r\n_Olenellus_ and other fossils. But in the uppermost group, consisting\r\nof limestones, every particle of the sediment appears to have passed\r\nthrough the intestines of worms, and as it gathered on the sea-bottom\r\nit enclosed and has preserved a varied and abundant assemblage\r\nof organisms, including trilobites, gasteropods and a number of\r\ncephalopods. While in the Cambrian rocks of Europe calcareous bands are\r\ncomparatively rare, in those of North America they are not infrequent.\r\nHence it is largely from American deposits that our knowledge of the\r\nCambrian fauna has been derived.\r\n\r\nNot a vestige of any vertebrate organism has yet been detected among\r\nthe earlier Palæozoic sediments. So far as we know, there were no\r\nfishes in the Cambrian seas. The highest organisms then existing were\r\nchambered shells, a once abundant and singularly varied class, of which\r\nthe living Nautilus is now the sole representative.\r\n\r\nIn trying to realize the general geographical conditions of Cambrian\r\ntime, the geologist finds himself entirely without any evidence as\r\nto the character of the terrestrial vegetation. We can hardly doubt\r\nthat the land was clothed with plants, probably including lycopods\r\nand ferns, possibly even cycads and conifers. But no remains of this\r\nflora have yet been recovered. Nor have any traces of land-animals\r\nbeen detected. All that we yet know of the life of the period has\r\nbeen gleaned from marine sediments, which show that the invertebrate\r\npopulation by which the sea was then tenanted embraced some of the\r\nleading types of structure that have survived through all the long\r\nvista of geological time down to our own day.\r\n\r\nSome of the shore-lines of the Cambrian waters may still be traced,\r\nand it is possible to say where the land of the time stood and where\r\nlay the sea. In the British area the largest relic of Cambrian land is\r\nfound in the far north-west of Scotland. Formed partly of the Lewisian\r\nGneiss and partly of the Torridon Sandstone, it takes in the whole\r\nchain of the Outer Hebrides and likewise part of the present western\r\nseaboard of Sutherland and Ross. Along the margin of that northern land\r\nthe white sand was laid down which now gleams in sheets of snow-like\r\nquartzite on most of the higher mountains from Cape Wrath to Skye. The\r\nsea lay to the east and, so far as we know, may have stretched across\r\nthe rest of Scotland, and the north and centre of England. Another\r\nvestige of the land of this ancient era occurs in Anglesey. There, and\r\nlikewise over scattered tracts in the Midlands, and in the south-west\r\nof England, the geologist seems to descry the last relics of islets\r\nthat rose out of the Cambrian sea, and are now surrounded with its\r\nhardened sediments.\r\n\r\nWhile such was the general aspect of the region of the British Isles\r\nduring Cambrian time, volcanic action manifested itself at various\r\nlocalities over the area, breaking out on the sea-bottom, and pouring\r\nforth sheets of lava and showers of ashes, which mingled with the sand\r\nand silt that were settling there at the time. In the northern or\r\nScottish tract no trace of this subterranean activity has been found;\r\nbut in the English Midlands and over much of Wales abundant evidence\r\nhas been obtained to show that in those districts the Cambrian period\r\nwas marked by frequent and prolonged eruptions.\r\n\r\nAs its name denotes, the Cambrian system is typically developed in\r\nWales. It was there that Sedgwick first worked out the stratigraphical\r\nrelations of its ancient sediments, and that Murchison demonstrated the\r\nsuccession of organic remains contained in them, applying to them the\r\nprinciples of classification laid down by William Smith in regard to\r\nthe Secondary formations. It was there too that some of the earliest\r\nand most memorable achievements were made in the investigation of\r\nancient volcanic rocks. Sedgwick and Murchison, besides the admirable\r\nwork which they accomplished in establishing the stratigraphy of\r\nthe older Palæozoic formations, clearly recognized that among these\r\nformations there were preserved the records of contemporaneous\r\nsubmarine eruptions. Sedgwick showed that the mountainous masses\r\nof eruptive rock in North Wales were really lavas and ashes, which\r\nhad been discharged over the sea-floor at the time when the ancient\r\nsediments of that region were deposited, while Murchison established\r\nthe same fact by numerous observations in the east and south of Wales,\r\nand in the bordering English counties. De la Beche had found similar\r\nevidence among the \"grauwacke\" rocks of Devonshire.[82]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: For early researches on the older Palæozoic volcanic\r\nrocks of Britain, see Sedgwick, _Proc.

At the outset of the following discussion I wish to\r\nexpress my admiration of the labours of the early pioneers who thus\r\nlaid for us the foundation of our knowledge of volcanic action in the\r\nPalæozoic periods. To De la Beche and his associates in the Survey a\r\nspecial measure of gratitude is due from all who have followed in their\r\nsteps and profited by their work. When we consider the condition of\r\ngeological science, and especially of the department of petrography, in\r\nthis country at the time when these early and detailed investigations\r\nwere carried on, when we remember the imperfection of much of the\r\ntopography on the old one-inch Ordnance maps (which were the only maps\r\nthen available), when we call to mind the rugged and lofty nature of\r\nthe ground where some of the most complicated geological structures\r\nare displayed, we must admit that at the period when these maps and\r\nsections were produced they could not have been better done; nay,\r\nthat as in some important respects they were distinctly in advance\r\nof their time, their publication marked an era in the progress of\r\nstructural, and especially of volcanic, geology. The separation of\r\nlavas and tuffs over hundreds of square miles in a mountainous region,\r\nthe discrimination of intrusive sheets and eruptive bosses, the\r\ndetermination of successive stratigraphical zones of volcanic activity\r\namong some of the oldest fossiliferous formations, were achievements\r\nwhich will ever place the names of Ramsay, Selwyn, Jukes and their\r\nassociates high in the bede-roll of geological science. No one ever\r\nthinks now of making a geological excursion into Wales without carrying\r\nwith him the sheets of the Geological Survey map. These form his guide\r\nand handbook, and furnish him with the basis of information from which\r\nhe starts in his own researches.\r\n\r\nBut science does not stand still. The most perfect geological map that\r\ncan be made to-day will be capable of improvement thirty or forty years\r\nhence. The maps of the Geological Survey are no exception to this rule.\r\nIn criticizing and correcting them, however, let us judge them not by\r\nthe standard of knowledge which we have now reached, but by that of the\r\ntime when they were prepared. It is easy to criticize; it is not so\r\neasy to recognize how much we owe to the very work which we pronounce\r\nto be imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe ancient volcanoes of Wales, thanks mainly to the admirable labours\r\nof my former friend and chief, Sir Andrew C. Ramsay, have taken a\r\nfamiliar place in geological literature. But a good deal has been\r\nlearnt regarding them since he mapped and wrote. The volcanic history,\r\nas he viewed it, began in the Arenig period. The progress of subsequent\r\ninquiry, however, has shown that there are volcanic rocks in Wales of\r\nmuch older date. I shall show that the Cambrian period, both in South\r\nand North Wales, was eminently volcanic.\r\n\r\nMuch controversy having arisen as to the respective limits and\r\nnomenclature of the older Palæozoic rocks, let me state, at the outset\r\nof the inquiry into the volcanic eruptions of Cambrian time, that under\r\nthe term \"Cambrian\" I class all the known Palæozoic rocks which lie\r\nbelow the bottom of what is termed the Arenig group. It was maintained\r\nby Sir Andrew Ramsay and his colleagues on the Geological Survey that\r\non the mainland of Wales no base is ever found to the Cambrian system.\r\nMore recently certain conglomerates have been fixed upon as the true\r\nCambrian base, both in South and North Wales, and endeavours have been\r\nmade to trace an unconformability at that line, all rocks below it\r\nbeing treated as pre-Cambrian. But conglomerates do not necessarily\r\nmark a stratigraphical discordance, and in South Wales there is no\r\ntrace of any unconformability between the strata above and below the\r\nsupposed line of break.[83] Professor Bonney has shown that in North\r\nWales several zones of conglomerate have been erroneously identified\r\nas the supposed basal platform of the Cambrian series, and more\r\nrecently Mr. Blake has pointed out that some of these conglomerates are\r\nunquestionably Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: See a discussion of this subject in _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. xxxix. (1883), p. 305.]\r\n\r\nMy own examination so far confirms the conclusions arrived at by\r\nthese observers. Like my predecessors in the Geological Survey,\r\nhowever, I have been unable to detect anywhere in Caernarvonshire\r\nor Merionethshire a base to the Cambrian system, and I am compelled\r\nto agree with them in regarding as Cambrian (partly even as Lower\r\nSilurian) all the rocks from Bangor to Llanllyfni, which have more\r\nrecently been classed as pre-Cambrian. But though thus supporting their\r\ngeneral stratigraphy, I am bound to acknowledge that they failed to\r\nrecognize the existence of a great volcanic series below the Arenig\r\nhorizon. The existence of this series, noticed by Sedgwick, was first\r\ndefinitely stated by Professor Hughes,[84] and his statements have been\r\nconfirmed and extended by subsequent observers, notably by Professor\r\nBonney and Mr. Blake. The Cambrian period is thus proved to have been\r\nperhaps even more continuously volcanic than the Lower Silurian period\r\nwas in Wales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._ vol. iii.

The\r\ndistrict around St. David's has the distinction of being the first\r\nin which volcanic rocks of such high antiquity were recognized. As\r\nfar back as the year 1842, Ramsay found that \"felspathic volcanic\r\nash\" was associated with other proofs of igneous action, and this\r\nfact was recorded by him on the published Horizontal Sections of the\r\nGeological Survey. Unfortunately he afterwards came to regard the\r\nrocks as \"altered Cambrian,\" thus following certain hypothetical views\r\nwhich, as will be further alluded to in the sequel, he had adopted\r\nin explanation of the phenomena in Caernarvonshire and in Anglesey.\r\nThe volcanic nature of these ancient materials was subsequently\r\nrediscovered by Dr. Hicks, who has devoted much time and labour to\r\ntheir study. Distinguishing the volcanic series of St. David's by\r\nthe name \"Pebidian,\" he has contended that it forms a pre-Cambrian\r\nsystem separated by an unconformability from the base of the Cambrian\r\nformations. He likewise endeavoured to show that an older system\r\nof rhyolitic lavas, felsitic breccias and hälleflintas could be\r\ndistinguished, which he termed \"Arvonian\"; and more ancient still,\r\na core of granitoid or gneissic rocks, which he separated under the\r\nname of \"Dimetian.\" My own investigation of the ground thoroughly\r\nconvinced me that there are no pre-Cambrian rocks at St. David's;\r\nthat the \"Arvonian\" and \"Dimetian\" series are merely intrusive rocks\r\n(quartz-porphyry, granite, etc.) which have invaded the volcanic\r\nseries; and that the \"Pebidian,\" instead of being a pre-Cambrian\r\nformation on which the Cambrian base rests unconformably, is a group of\r\nvolcanic rocks into which the Cambrian strata pass down conformably,\r\nand which in the St. David's district constitutes the lowest group of\r\nthe Cambrian system.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: For Dr. Hicks' views, see especially his papers in the\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xxxi. xxxiii. xxxiv. xl. My criticism\r\nof them will be found in _op. cit._ vol. xxxix. (1883), subsequently in\r\nthe main confirmed by Prof. Lloyd Morgan, _op. cit._ xlvi. p. 241. See\r\nalso Prof. Blake, _op. cit._ xl. (1884). Dr. Hicks in his more recent\r\npapers has merely reiterated his previously published opinions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walker & Boutall sc._\r\n\r\nFig. 40.--Map of the volcanic district of St. David's.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic geology of St. David's possesses a special interest\r\ninasmuch as it embraces a tolerably full development of various\r\nfeatures which characterize the volcanic groups of later Palæozoic\r\nsystems. Though the rocks are chiefly tuffs, they include also sheets\r\nof lava, as well as sills, dykes and bosses. They show a remarkable\r\nrange in chemical composition from quite basic to highly acid\r\nmaterials. They present the amplest proofs of having been erupted\r\nand spread out over the sea-bottom, and they likewise afford clear\r\nevidence of alternation with the ordinary non-volcanic sediment of the\r\ntime to which they belong. In these respects they are particularly\r\nnoteworthy, for they prove that in the earliest Palæozoic ages the\r\nessential features of volcanic action were already as well developed as\r\nin any subsequent epoch of geological history.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic group of St. David's attains a visible thickness of about\r\n1800 feet. Its upper part graduates upward into purple and green\r\nLower Cambrian sandstones. The base of the group is not seen owing to\r\nthe plicated structure of the district. Hence the total thickness of\r\nvolcanic material cannot be determined, neither can we tell on what it\r\nrests, whether on a still lower sedimentary series or on some platform\r\nof pre-Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the group, notwithstanding all that has been written\r\nabout it, has never yet been adequately worked out. The unfortunate and\r\nbarren controversy about supposed pre-Cambrian rocks at St. David's\r\nhas tended to obscure the real importance of these rocks as the oldest\r\nwell-preserved record of volcanic action in Britain. They deserve to\r\nbe carefully surveyed on maps of a large scale, in the same detailed\r\nmanner as has been so successfully applied to the elucidation of\r\nyounger volcanic tracts. Until such detailed investigation is made,\r\nany account of them which is given can be little more than a general\r\noutline of the subject. The following description is the result of\r\nmy examination of the ground in company with my colleague Mr. B. N.\r\nPeach, and afterwards with the late Mr. W. Topley.[86] A few additional\r\nobservations, from the subsequent exploration of Professor Lloyd\r\nMorgan,[87] are incorporated in the narrative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxix. (1883), p. 294 _et\r\nseq._ While the essential parts of the investigation are given in the\r\nfollowing pages, I would refer the reader to this paper for details not\r\ntransferred to the present volume.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Op. cit._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p. 241.]\r\n\r\nThe geologist who traces these St. David's rocks in the field cannot\r\nfail to be struck with their general resemblance to volcanic masses\r\nof later Palæozoic date. Many of the lavas and tuffs are in outward\r\ncharacters quite indistinguishable from those of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone and Carboniferous systems of Britain. So many points of\r\ndetail may be observed to be common to the Palæozoic eruptive rocks\r\nall over the country from the Cambrian to the Permian periods as to\r\nindicate that volcanic phenomena must have recurred under much the same\r\nconditions throughout Palæozoic time.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger part of the Cambrian volcanic group of St. David's\r\nconsists of bedded tuffs, though a few lavas are interstratified in it,\r\nparticularly towards the top. The whole has subsequently been invaded\r\nby acid protrusions, and lastly by basic dykes.\r\n\r\n1. _Bedded Tuffs and Lavas._--The tuffs, which are the predominant\r\nmembers of the volcanic group, present many varieties of colour, from\r\ndark purple, through tints of brick-red and lilac, to pale pink, yellow\r\nand creamy white, but not unfrequently assume various shades of dull\r\ngreen. They vary likewise in texture from somewhat coarse breccias\r\nor agglomerates, through many gradations, into fine silky schists in\r\nwhich the tuffaceous character is almost lost. Generally they are\r\ndistinctly granular, presenting to the naked eye abundant angular and\r\nsubangular lapilli, among which broken crystals of a white, somewhat\r\nkaolinized, felspar and fragments of fine-grained felsite are often\r\nconspicuous. The greater part of the tuffs, particularly the purple,\r\nred and dark-green varieties, which constitute so large a proportion of\r\nthe whole, has been derived from the explosion of basic rocks similar\r\nin character to the diabases now found associated with them. On the\r\nother hand, the paler varieties, both in the form of fine tuffs and of\r\nbreccias, have probably resulted mainly from the destruction of more\r\nsiliceous lavas, probably felsites (rhyolites) or other acid rocks.\r\n\r\nThat many of the tuffs are due to the destruction of diabase-lavas\r\nmay be surmised from their close general external resemblance to\r\nthese rocks, and from the way in which they are associated with the\r\ncontemporaneous sheets of diabase. Some of the dull dark-purple tuffs\r\nmight almost at first sight be mistaken for truly eruptive rocks. The\r\nanalyses of two typical examples of these basic tuffs (Nos. I. and\r\nII.), and one (No. III.) of an intermediate variety containing an\r\nadmixture of acid fragments, are given in the subjoined table.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                             |    I.  |   II.  |   III. |\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |SiO_{2}                      |  51·25 |  48·11 |  61·54 |\r\n  |Al_{2}O_{3}                  |  20·41 |  13·30 |  16·30 |\r\n  |Fe_{2}O_{3}                  |   3·02 |   3·70 |   4·40 |\r\n  |FeO                          |   3·91 |   8·10 |   3·66 |\r\n  |MnO                          |   0·21 |   1·43 |   0·32 |\r\n  |CaO                          |   4·53 |   8·48 |   3·08 |\r\n  |MgO                          |   7·22 |   9·51 |   2·99 |\r\n  |K_{2}O                       |   2·93 |   1·57 |   1·62 |\r\n  |Na_{2}O                      |   1·82 |   1·96 |   2·81 |\r\n  |H_{2}O and Loss on Ignition. |   5·02 |   4·21 |   2·99 |\r\n  |Total.                       | 100·32 | 100·37 |  99·71 |\r\n  |Specific Gravity.            |   2·84 |   2·92 |   ...  |\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n    I.

Grey granular felsitic tuff, Bridge over Allan River north from St.\r\n        David's Board Schools. Analysis by Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n   VI. Pale pinkish-white, finely schistose tuff--a characteristic sample\r\n         of the \"Porth-lisky schists.\" Analysis by Prof. Renard.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of texture can be traced among the tuffs, from coarse\r\nbreccias or agglomerates, with blocks a yard or more in length,\r\nto fine schistose mudstones or sericitic schists. One of the most\r\nremarkable of the finer kinds, found near Pen-y-foel, is externally\r\ndirty-green, compact and tolerably homogeneous, but with distinct\r\nevidence of its clastic character. Under the microscope it is\r\nfound to be composed mainly of lapilli of a peculiar rock, which\r\nis characterized by the abundance and freshness of its plagioclase\r\n(an unusual feature in the volcanic group of St. David's); by the\r\nlarge, well-defined crystals (one of which measured 0·022 inch\r\nby 0·0125 inch) of augite; by large crystals replaced by green\r\ndecomposition-products, but having the external form of olivine; by\r\nthe absence or scantiness of any base or groundmass; and, in many of\r\nthe lapilli, by the abundance of spherical cells, either empty or\r\nfilled up as amygdales with decomposition-products. These spherical\r\nvapour-vesicles, so characteristic of the basic or palagonitic lapilli\r\nin many Palæozoic volcanic vents, were found in one fragment, where\r\nthey were particularly abundant, to range from a minimum of 0·0008 inch\r\nto a maximum of 0·0033 inch, with a mean of about 0·0018. The rock\r\nfrom which these lapilli have been derived comes nearest to one of the\r\ndiabases from the same part of the district (which will afterwards be\r\nreferred to), but shows a closer approach to basalt rocks.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting tuff is that of which the analysis (No. II.)\r\nhas been given. It occurs not far from the horizon of the rock just\r\ndescribed. Under a low power, it is seen to be composed mainly of\r\nfragments of diabase like the rocks of Rhosson and Clegyr Foig. These\r\nfragments are subangular, or irregular in shape, and vary considerably\r\nin size. They are sometimes finely cellular--the cavities, as in the\r\ncase just referred to, being spherical. The plagioclase crystals\r\nin the diabase-lapilli are everywhere conspicuous; so also is the\r\naugite, which occurs in larger forms than in the rock of Rhosson or\r\nClegyr Foig. Next in abundance to these basic fragments are rounded\r\nor subangular pieces of felsite. These weather out in conspicuous\r\ngrey rough projections on the exposed face of the rock; under the\r\nmicroscope they are seen to consist of fine granular felsite, which\r\nshows a groundmass remaining dark between crossed nicols, but with\r\nluminous points and filaments, and an occasional spherulite giving\r\nthe usual cross in polarized light. Lapilli of an older tuff may here\r\nand there be detected. A few angular and subangular grains of quartz\r\nare scattered through the rock. The lapilli are bound together by a\r\nfinely-granular dirty-green substance.\r\n\r\nAs a typical illustration of the minute structure of the felsitic\r\ntuffs, I may refer to the rock No. V. of the foregoing analyses. It is\r\ncomposed mainly of fragments of various felsites, many of which show\r\ngood flow-structure. Large, and usually broken, crystals of orthoclase\r\nare dispersed among the other ingredients. Here and there a fragment\r\nof diabase may be detected; but I could find no trace of pieces of the\r\npeculiar microcrystalline spherulitic quartz-porphyries of St. David's.\r\nThere is but little that could be called matrix cementing the lapilli\r\ntogether. The presence of fragments of diabase may possibly reduce the\r\nproportion of silica and increase that of magnesia, as compared with\r\nwhat would otherwise have been present in the rock.\r\n\r\nSome of the tuffs appear to have been a kind of volcanic mud. A\r\nspecimen of this nature collected from the road-side section, north of\r\nthe Board School, presents a finely-granular paste enclosing abundant\r\nangular and subangular lapilli of diabase, a smaller proportion\r\nof felsite (sometimes displaying perfect flow-structure), broken\r\nplagioclase crystals, and a greenish micaceous mineral which has been\r\nsubsequently developed out of the matrix between the lapilli.\r\n\r\nThough they lie in the sedimentary series above the main volcanic\r\ngroup, I may refer here to certain thin bands of tuff at Castell, on\r\naccount of their interest in relation to the true Cambrian age of the\r\nvolcanic group. They are not quite so fresh as the tuff that occurs in\r\nthicker masses, but their volcanic origin is readily observable. One\r\nband appears to be made up of the debris of some basic rock, like the\r\ndiabase of the district, through which detached plagioclase crystals\r\nare scattered. The lapilli are subangular; and around their border a\r\ngranular deposit of hæmatite has taken place, giving a red colour to\r\nthe rock. Another band presents small angular lapilli, almost entirely\r\ncomposed of a substance which to the naked eye, or with a lens, is\r\ndull, white and clay-like, easily scratched, and slightly unctuous to\r\nthe touch. Under the microscope, with a low power, it becomes pale\r\ngreyish-green and transparent, and is seen to consist in large part of\r\naltered felspar crystals, partially kaolinized and partially changed\r\ninto white mica and calcite. These scattered crystals are true volcanic\r\nlapilli, and have not been derived from the mechanical waste of any\r\npre-existing volcanic rock. In the tuffs interstratified with the\r\nconglomerate, at the quarry above Porth-clais, though much decomposed,\r\ncrystals of plagioclase can likewise still be traced. These strata are\r\nalso true tuffs, and not mere detritus due to mechanical degradation\r\n(see Fig. 41).\r\n\r\nThe general result of the study of the microscopic structure of the\r\nCambrian tuffs of St. David's may be briefly summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. These pyroclastic deposits are almost wholly composed of fragments\r\nof eruptive rocks, sometimes rounded, but usually angular or\r\nsubangular. In the more granular varieties very little matrix is\r\npresent; it consists of fine debris of the same materials. No detached\r\nmicrolites have been noted, such as are common among modern volcanic\r\nashes; but there are abundant ejected crystals. In these respects\r\nthe Cambrian tuffs resemble those of the other Palæozoic systems. A\r\nmingling of grains of quartz-sand may indicate the intermixture of\r\nordinary with volcanic sediment.\r\n\r\n2. They may be divided into two groups--one composed mainly of\r\nfragments of diabase or other similar basic rocks, the other of\r\nfelsite. The former group has doubtless been derived from the explosion\r\nof such rocks as the diabase-sheets of the district. The felsitic tuffs\r\nhave not been observed to contain any fragments of the microcrystalline\r\nquartz-porphyries of St. David's. They have been derived from true\r\nfine-grained felsites or rhyolites. There are various intermediate\r\nvarieties of tuff, due to the mingling in various proportions of the\r\ntwo kinds of debris.\r\n\r\n3. They are marked by the presence of some characteristic features\r\nof the volcanic vents of later Palæozoic time, and in particular\r\nby presenting the following peculiarities: (_a_) lapilli of a\r\nminutely-cellular pumice with spherical cells; (_b_) lapilli with\r\nwell-developed flow-structure; (_c_) lapilli consisting of a pale green\r\nserpentinous substance resembling altered palagonite and probably\r\noriginally glass; (_d_) lapilli derived from the destruction of older\r\ntuffs; and (_e_) lapilli consisting of ejected crystals, especially of\r\nfelspars, sometimes entire, often broken.\r\n\r\n4. They frequently show that they have undergone metamorphism, by the\r\ndevelopment of a pale greenish micaceous mineral between the lapilli,\r\nthe change advancing until the fine tuffs occasionally pass into fine\r\nsilky schists.\r\n\r\nIn my study of the St. David's district, I was unable to observe any\r\nevidence that the basic and siliceous tuffs characterize two distinct\r\nperiods of volcanicity. From the foregoing analyses it appears that\r\nsome of the oldest visible tuffs which are seen between Pen-maen-melyn\r\nand Pen-y-foel contain only 48·11 per cent of silica; while a specimen\r\nfrom Porth-lisky yielded 72·63 per cent of that ingredient. Specimens\r\ntaken even from adjacent beds show great differences in the percentage\r\nof silica, as may be seen in the analyses Nos. III. and V.\r\n\r\nThis alternation of basic and siliceous fragmental materials has\r\nits parallel in the neighbouring eruptive rocks, some of which are\r\nolivine-diabases containing only 45 per cent of silica, while others\r\nare highly siliceous quartz-porphyries. But all the siliceous eruptive\r\nrocks, so far as I have been able to discover, are intrusive, and\r\nbelong, I believe, to a later period than that of the volcanic group;\r\nin no single instance do they appear to me to be true superficial\r\nlava-flows. On the other hand, the basic eruptive rocks occur both\r\nas contemporaneous sheets and as intrusive masses. The presence of\r\nboth siliceous and basic lavas in the Cambrian volcanic reservoirs,\r\nhowever, is proved by the character of the tuffs. It would appear from\r\nthe evidence at present known, that while the basic lavas were most\r\nabundant in the vents during the volcanic period recorded by the rocks\r\nof St. David's, furnishing the material for most of the fragmental\r\neruptions, and issuing in occasional superficial streams of molten\r\nrock, the siliceous lavas did not flow forth at the surface, though\r\ntheir debris was copiously discharged in the form of dust and lapilli.\r\n\r\nThe rise of both basic and acid lavas at different periods in the\r\nsame or adjoining vents, so familiar in recent volcanic phenomena,\r\nthus appears to have also characterized some of the oldest examples\r\nof volcanic action. An interesting parallel may be traced between the\r\nsuccession of events at St. David's and that which occurred in the\r\nvolcanic group of the Lower Old Red Sandstone of the Pentland Hills,\r\nnear Edinburgh, of which a detailed account will be given in Chapter\r\nxx. of this volume. It is also worthy of remark that in the latest of\r\nthe volcanic episodes in British geology a remarkable similarity to the\r\nSt. David's volcanic group may be observed. Some of the older Tertiary\r\nagglomerates are full of pieces of acid rocks (felsites, rhyolites or\r\ngranophyres), while the lavas poured out at the surface were mainly\r\nbasalts.\r\n\r\nIn the volcanic group of St. David's the tuffs contain evidence that\r\nordinary sedimentation was not entirely interrupted by the volcanic\r\ndischarges. Thus, in the Allan valley, west from the Cathedral, one of\r\nthe schistose tuffs is full of well-rounded pebbles of white quartz.\r\nOccasional shaly bands indicate the deposit of mud with the tuffs.\r\n\r\nExcluding the granites and porphyries (which are described at p. 155),\r\ntwo kinds of eruptive rocks are associated with the volcanic group. One\r\nof these is certainly intrusive and of late date, viz. dykes and veins\r\nof diabase, to be afterwards referred to. The other kind occurs in long\r\nparallel sheets, some of which, if not all, are true contemporaneous\r\nlava-streams, erupted at intervals during the accumulation of the\r\nvolcanic group. They form prominent crags to the west of St. David's,\r\nsuch as Clegyr Foig, Rhosson, and the rocky ground rising from the\r\neastern shores of Ramsey Sound. Their dip and strike coincide with\r\nthose of the tuffs above and below them. It is possible that some of\r\nthese sheets may be intrusive sills intercalated along the bedding of\r\nthe tuffs; and in one or two cases I have observed indications of what,\r\non further and more careful exploration, may prove to be disruption\r\nacross the bedding.\r\n\r\nBut it is the interbedded sheets that possess the chief interest as\r\nsuperficial lava-streams of such venerable antiquity. They present many\r\nof the ordinary features of true lava-flows. In particular a slaggy\r\nstructure may be detected at the bottom of a sheet, the vesicles being\r\nhere and there lengthened in the direction of flow. Some of the sheets\r\nare in part amygdaloidal. The alternation of these sheets with tuffs,\r\nevidently derived from lavas of similar character, is another argument\r\nin favour of their contemporaneous date. One of the best localities for\r\nstudying these features lies between Clegyr Foig and the coast, west of\r\nRhosson.\r\n\r\nThe eruptive rocks thicken towards the south-west, as if the main\r\nvents had lain in that direction. There are doubtless intrusive as\r\nwell as contemporaneously interbedded masses in the rough ground\r\nbetween Pen-maen-melyn and Treginnis. To separate these out would be\r\na most interesting and beautiful piece of mapping for any competent\r\ngeologist in possession of a good map on a sufficiently large scale.\r\n\r\nThe interbedded lavas, so far as I have had an opportunity of studying\r\nthem, appear to present remarkable uniformity of petrographical\r\ncharacters. Megascopically they are dull, fine-grained to compact,\r\nsparingly porphyritic, ranging in colour from an epidote-green to\r\ndull blackish-green and dark chocolate-brown. Some of them are finely\r\nporphyritic from the presence of small glistening surfaces which\r\npresent the colour and metallic lustre of hæmatite and yield its\r\ncharacteristic streak. Obviously basic rocks, they present, as I\r\nhave said, a close external resemblance to many of the lavas of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous districts of Scotland. From\r\ntheir chemical composition and microscopic structure they may be most\r\nappropriately ranged among the diabases. The analyses of two of the\r\nmost conspicuous diabases of this class in the district, those of\r\nRhosson (VII.) and Clegyr Foig (VIII.), by Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson, are\r\nshown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------+--------+\r\n  |                             |    VII. |  VIII. |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------+--------+\r\n  | SiO_{2}                     |   45·92 |  45·38 |\r\n  | Al_{2} O_{3}                |   18·16 |  16·62 |\r\n  | Fe_{2} O_{3}                |    1·18 |   4·06 |\r\n  | FeO                         |    9·27 |   8·63 |\r\n  | MnO                         |    0·19 |   0·14 |\r\n  | CaO                         |    7·19 |   8·19 |\r\n  | MgO                         |   10·07 |   9·41 |\r\n  | K_{2}O                      |    1·78 |   0·71 |\r\n  | Na_{2}O                     |    2·12 |   2·20 |\r\n  | H_{2}O and Loss on Ignition.|    4·22 |   4·34 |\r\n  | Insoluble Residue.          |    0·04 |   0·08 |\r\n  | Total.                      |  100·14 |  99·76 |\r\n  | Specific Gravity.           |    2·96 |   2.99 |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe two rocks here analyzed, likewise that from the crag south of\r\nCastell and that from the cliffs at the southern end of the promontory\r\nbetween Ramsey Sound and Pen-y-foel, show under the microscope a\r\ngeneral similarity of composition and structure. They present a\r\nvariable quantity of a base, which under a ⅕ objective is resolved\r\ninto ill-defined coalescent globulites and fibre-like bodies, that\r\nremain dark when rotated between crossed nicols. In some varieties,\r\nas in part of Rhosson Crag, the base is nearly lost in the crowd\r\nof crystalline constituents; in others, as in the crag south of\r\nCastell, it forms a large part of the whole mass, and may be seen in\r\ndistinct spaces free from any crystalline particles. Through this\r\nbase are diffused, in vast numbers, irregularly-shaped grains of\r\naugite, seldom showing idiomorphic forms. These grains, or granules,\r\nmay perhaps average about 0·003 inch in diameter. Plagioclase is\r\ngenerally hardly to be recognized, though here and there a crystal\r\nwith characteristic twinning may be detected in the base. Magnetite\r\noccurs abundantly--its minute octahedra, with their peculiar colour and\r\nlustre, being apparent with reflected light on the fresher specimens,\r\nthough apt to be lost as diffused ferruginous blotches in the more\r\ndecomposed varieties. But perhaps the most remarkable ingredient is\r\nolivine. Red hæmatitic crystals are visible, even to the naked eye,\r\ndispersed through the groundmass of the rocks. With a lens these\r\nmay be observed to be orthorhombic in form, and to be evidently\r\npseudomorphs after some mineral which has been converted chiefly\r\ninto hæmatite. Such red pseudomorphs are common in Carboniferous and\r\nOld Red Sandstone lavas, where in some cases they appear to be after\r\nhornblende, and in others after augite, but occasionally are suggestive\r\nof olivine, though with no trace of the original substance of that\r\nmineral. In the lava associated with the tuffs at the south end of\r\nthe promontory between Ramsey Sound and Pen-y-foel, however, certain\r\nlarge, well-developed pseudomorphs are undoubtedly after olivine.\r\nThey have the characteristic contour of that mineral and its peculiar\r\ntransverse curved and irregular fractures. The average length of these\r\npseudomorphs was found, from the measurement of six examples, to be\r\n0·023 inch, the largest being 0·034, and the smallest 0·014. Seen by\r\ntransmitted light they present a structureless pale-green material\r\nnearly inert in polarized light, round the borders and across fissures\r\nin which an opaque substance has been developed, as serpentine and\r\nmagnetite have been grouped in the familiar alteration of olivine.\r\nThe opaque material is bright brick-red in reflected light, and is\r\nevidently now chiefly oxidized into hæmatite. Every stage may be\r\ntraced, from orthorhombic forms with the incipient development of\r\ntransverse fissures filled with iron-oxide, to others of distorted\r\nshapes in which the ferruginous matter occupies the whole, or nearly\r\nthe whole, of the mould of the original crystal.\r\n\r\nThe rocks now described differ from the Palæozoic andesites or\r\n\"porphyrites,\" with which I am acquainted, in their more basic\r\ncomposition, in the less abundance of their microscopic base, in the\r\ncomparatively inconspicuous development of their felspars of later\r\nconsolidation, in the absence of large porphyritic felspars of earlier\r\nconsolidation, in the extraordinary prominence of the granular augite,\r\nand in the presence of olivine. In composition and structure they are\r\nessentially forms of olivine-diabase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 41.--Section showing the interstratification of tuff and\r\n     conglomerate above Lower Mill, St. David's.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbove the volcanic group of St. David's lies a band of\r\nquartz-conglomerate which has been taken by Dr. Hicks to mark the base\r\nof the Cambrian system. This rock, though mainly composed of quartz\r\nand quartzite, contains fragments of the underlying volcanic rocks.\r\nBut that it does not mark any decided break in the sedimentation, much\r\nless the violent unconformability and vast interval of time which\r\nit has been erroneously supposed to do, is well illustrated by the\r\noccurrence of bands of tuff, as well as diffused volcanic dust, in\r\nthe conglomerate and also in the green and red shales and sandstones\r\nwhich conformably overlie it. An example of this intercalation\r\nof volcanic material is represented in Fig. 41. On the left side\r\nvertical layers of fine reddish tuff (_a_) are succeeded by a band\r\nof quartz conglomerate (_b_) of the usual character. Parallel to this\r\nconglomerate comes a band, about six inches thick, of fine tuff (_c_),\r\nfollowed by ashy sandstone (_d_), which graduates into conglomerate\r\n(_e_). No more complete evidence could be desired of the perfect\r\ninosculation of the conglomerate with the volcanic group. On the coast\r\nat Nun's Chapel similar evidence presents itself. The conglomerate\r\nthere contains some thin seams of tuff, and is intercalated between a\r\nseries of dull green agglomerates and tuffs and some greenish shales\r\nand sandstones with layers of tuff.\r\n\r\nNot less striking is the evidence of the contemporaneous eruption of\r\nfine volcanic dust in the overlying shales and sandstones.[88] Some\r\nof the red shales are full of this material, which here and there\r\nis gathered into the thin seams or ribs of which the microscopic\r\ncharacters have already been described. This diffused volcanic detritus\r\nmarks, no doubt, the enfeebled discharges of fine dust towards the\r\nclose of the volcanic episode in the Lower Cambrian period at St.\r\nDavid's. It would be difficult to find an instance of a more perfect\r\ntransition from a series of thoroughly volcanic masses into a series of\r\nordinary mechanical sediments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: These are a portion of Dr. Hicks' \"Caerfai group\" in the\r\nLower Cambrian series. They have yielded Lower Cambrian fossils.]\r\n\r\n2. _Intrusive Granite and Quartz-Porphyry._--The heart of the\r\nvolcanic group is pierced by a mass of granite which also cuts the\r\nconglomerate and overlying shales and sandstones on the east side.\r\nThe age of this intrusive boss cannot be more definitely fixed than\r\nby saying that it must be later than the volcanic group. This rock\r\nhas been the subject of a remarkable amount of description, and has\r\nbeen dignified by being actually elevated into a distinct Archæan\r\n\"formation\" composed of \"highly crystalline gneissic rocks,\" with\r\n\"bands of limestone, hornblende, chlorite, and micaceous schists.\"[89]\r\nInto this somewhat dreary chapter of English geological literature\r\nit is fortunately not necessary to enter here. I will only say that\r\nthe rock is unquestionably a granite, with no essential differences\r\nfrom many other bosses regarding which there has been no controversy.\r\nIt is a holocrystalline rock with a thoroughly granitic texture, and\r\ncomposed of the ordinary minerals of granite--quartz, orthoclase\r\nand plagioclase, among which a green chloritic mineral, more or\r\nless plentiful, probably represents original hornblende, biotite or\r\naugite. Sometimes the quartz and felspar in the body of the rock show\r\na micropegmatitic arrangement, and the same structure occurs in veins\r\nthat traverse it. This structure gives the rock some resemblance to the\r\nTertiary granites and granophyres of Ireland and Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: See the papers cited on p. 145 and my discussion of the\r\nrelations of this granite in _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxix.;\r\nalso Prof. Lloyd Morgan, _op. cit._ vol. xlvi. (1890).]\r\n\r\nThis granite has undergone a good deal of decomposition, for its\r\nfelspars are turbid, and its original ferro-magnesian constituents are\r\nalways replaced by green chloritic aggregates, while epidote is also\r\npresent. The rock tends to become finer in grain towards the margin,\r\nand then sometimes assumes a more decidedly pegmatitic structure,\r\nlike graphic granite. At the northern end of the granite ridge, a\r\ngradation can be traced from the ordinary texture through increasingly\r\nfine-grained varieties until we pass into a microcrystalline\r\nspherulitic porphyry. After a careful examination of the ground I\r\nsatisfied myself that the spherulitic quartz-porphyries, which form a\r\nconspicuous feature in the geology of St. David's, are really offshoots\r\nfrom this granitic core.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: These apophyses from the granite constitute the\r\n\"Arvonian\" formation of Dr. Hicks' pre-Cambrian series of St. David's.]\r\n\r\nThese spherulitic rocks have been fully described.[91] They consist\r\nof a base composed of a microcrystalline aggregate of quartz and\r\northoclase, which is distributed between the spherulites. These\r\nhave been developed in remarkable beauty and perfection. While the\r\nmicrocrystalline structure is everywhere recognizable, the spherulites\r\noccasionally disappear. But their absence is merely local, and they may\r\nbe found both in large dykes and narrow veins. A further porphyritic\r\nstructure is given to the rocks by the presence in them of abundant\r\nquartz, which takes the form of conspicuous rounded blebs or worn\r\ncrystals sometimes distinctly dihexihedral, but with somewhat blunted\r\nangles. Porphyritic plagioclase is also common. Flow-structure is\r\noccasionally traceable. Some parts of these rocks where the porphyritic\r\nelements are locally absent might be cursorily classed as felsites;\r\nbut they all possess a microcrystalline and not a felsitic base. They\r\ncannot be confounded with the true felsites of which fragments occur in\r\nthe tuffs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: See, for example, J. Davies, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xxiv. p. 164, xxxv. p. 203; also the paper already referred to,\r\n_op. cit._ xxxix. p. 315; and Mr. Teall's _British Petrography_, p.\r\n334.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the parallelism that may be traced between the earliest\r\nPalæozoic agglomerates and those of the youngest volcanic series\r\nof Britain, a close analogy may also be noticed between the acid\r\nintrusive rocks of the two widely-separated periods. In both cases we\r\nhave a granitic core sending out apophyses which assume a spherulitic\r\nstructure and traverse earlier volcanic products of the district.\r\n\r\nThese spherulitic quartz-porphyries of St. David's occur as bosses,\r\ndykes (elvans) or veins, cutting through all horizons of the volcanic\r\ngroup, and in one case apparently, if not actually, reaching the quartz\r\nconglomerate. One of the best exposures of this intrusive character may\r\nbe seen in the cliff below Nun's Chapel, where the elvan runs along the\r\nface of the cliff through the uppermost zone of the volcanic group,\r\ncutting the strata somewhat irregularly. Apparently in connection with\r\nthis dyke, a network of intrusions of decomposed quartz-porphyry may be\r\nobserved in the shales along the face of the cliff immediately below\r\nNun's Chapel. On the whole, the intruded material has forced its way\r\nalong the bedding-planes of the shales, but has also broken across\r\nthem, sending out finger-like branches.\r\n\r\n3. _Diabase Dykes and Sills._--The latest rocks of the St. David's\r\ndistrict are dykes and intrusive sheets of diabase, which traverse\r\nall the other formations. The dykes are specially abundant in the\r\ngranite. One or two may be detected in almost every artificial opening\r\nwhich has been made in that rock; while on the coast-section they are\r\nhere and there profusely abundant. They are likewise frequent in the\r\nquartz-porphyries, and occur also in the volcanic group as well as in\r\nthe sandstones and shales above the conglomerate, but become fewer in\r\nnumber as they recede from the granite centre.[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: The occurrence of these dykes is paralleled by that of\r\nthe similar intrusions in the quartz-felsite of Llyn Padarn to be\r\nafterwards described.]\r\n\r\nIn external characters, the rock composing these dykes and sheets may\r\nbe described as usually a dull dirty-green or yellowish-brown mass, to\r\nwhich the old name of \"wacke\" might appropriately be given. It exhibits\r\nthe texture and mode of weathering of the more distinctly crystalline\r\nmembers of the basalt family. It is occasionally amygdaloidal or\r\ncellular, the kernels or cavities being arranged parallel with the\r\nsides of the dyke. Here and there a rudely prismatic structure extends\r\nbetween the walls.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of this rock has been described by Professor\r\nJudd, Mr. Davies and Mr. Tawney. It is a diabase, but more allied in\r\nstructure to true basalt than the olivine-diabase of the volcanic\r\ngroup. It especially differs from the older rock in the abundance and\r\nfreshness of its felspars, in the comparative scarcity of its augite,\r\nand in the absence of olivine. The magnesian silicates are very\r\ngenerally replaced by green decomposition-products diffused through\r\nthe mass. An occasional crystal of hornblende, recognizable by its\r\ncleavages and dichroism, may be detected. Some of the diabase dykes\r\npresent excellent examples of flow-structure. A beautiful instance\r\noccurs in a dyke that cuts the shales, in a small cove to the east of\r\nNun's Chapel. The shale and eruptive rock are in contact; and the small\r\nacicular prisms of felspar, besides ranging themselves in line parallel\r\nto the side of the dyke, stream round the larger felspar crystals.\r\n\r\nSome of the dykes or veins are only three inches broad. They send\r\nout fingers, and sometimes break abruptly across from one line to\r\nanother. They appear generally to have followed the lines of joint in\r\nthe granite, as Mr. Tawney has observed;[93] consequently they must be\r\nposterior to the development of the system of jointing in that rock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Proc. Nat. Hist. Soc. Bristol_, vol. ii. part ii.\r\n(1879), p. 115.]\r\n\r\nBesides the abundant dykes, there has been a more limited extrusion\r\nof the same material in sheets parallel (or approximately so) to the\r\nbedding of the sandstones and shales. These sheets are well displayed\r\nat St. John's Point, where evidence of their being intrusive, and not\r\ntruly bedded, may be seen along the fine cliffs which have been cut by\r\nthe waves on this part of the coast-line.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary series which overlies the volcanic group of St.\r\nDavid's, and contains the fossils of the lower part of the Cambrian\r\nsystem, gradually loses all trace of volcanic material, as its members\r\nare followed upward in stratigraphical order.[94] We thus learn that\r\nthe eruptions of this district came to an end in an early part of the\r\nCambrian period. But as we shall see in the following pages, volcanic\r\nactivity was subsequently renewed at no great distance in the next or\r\nSilurian period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Dr. Hicks has noted the occurrence of \"volcanic tuff\"\r\nin the Lower Lingula Flags of Porth-y-Rhaw, a little to the east of\r\nSt. David's (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xx. 1864, p. 240). This\r\nintercalation is marked as a \"dyke\" in the MS. notes of Sir A. C.\r\nRamsay on a copy of the Geological Survey map of the district.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CAMBRIAN VOLCANOES OF NORTH WALES, THE MALVERN HILLS AND\r\nWARWICKSHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH WALES\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian volcanic rocks in the northern part of the Welsh\r\nPrincipality have their main development in Caernarvonshire. Southwards\r\nfrom that tract, though the Lower Cambrian strata form a vast pile of\r\nsedimentary material in the Harlech anticline, which is estimated by\r\nthe Geological Survey to be from 6000 to 7000 feet thick, they have\r\nyielded no trace of any contemporaneous volcanic rocks.[95] The purple\r\nslates that rise along the centre of the anticline dip below the grits\r\nand conglomerates on either side without disclosing a glimpse of the\r\nbase of the system. This enormous accumulation of sedimentary deposits\r\nseems to diminish in thickness as it is traced northwards, for towards\r\nthe Menai Strait it does not reach more than a fourth part of the depth\r\nwhich it is said to display in the Harlech anticline.[96] In the Pass\r\nof Llanberis the series of grits that overlies the purple slates is\r\nestimated to be about 1300 feet thick.[97] This gradual thinning away\r\nof the Cambrian series towards the north was, in the opinion of Sir\r\nAndrew Ramsay, accompanied by an increasing metamorphism of the lower\r\nportions of the system. In his view, the long ridge of quartz-porphyry\r\nwhich crosses the lower end of Llyn Padarn represents the result of\r\nthe extreme alteration of the stratified rocks. He believed that\r\nhe could trace an insensible passage from the slates, grits and\r\nconglomerates into the porphyry, and he was led to the \"conviction that\r\nthe solid porphyry itself is nothing but the result of the alteration\r\nof the stratified masses carried a stage further than the stage of\r\nporcellanite, into the condition of that kind of absolute fusion that\r\nin many other regions seems to have resulted in the formation of\r\ngranites, syenites and other rocks, commonly called intrusive.\"[98]\r\nCertain structural lines in the quartz-porphyry he looked upon\r\nas indicating \"traces of stratification in a rock, the original\r\nfelspathic and quartzose material of which has been metamorphosed into\r\ntrue porphyry.\"[99] In conformity with these ideas, the remarkable\r\nfelspathic strata which lie nearest the porphyry were regarded as\r\nmetamorphosed Cambrian rocks, and where similar rocks reappear over\r\na large area near Bangor they were coloured on the map with the same\r\ntint and lettering as were used for the so-called \"altered Cambrian\" of\r\nAnglesey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. \"Geology of North\r\nWales,\" p. 21. It is possible that this thickness has been somewhat\r\noverestimated. Dr. Hicks (_Geol. Mag._ 1880, p. 519) has referred to\r\ncertain \"highly felsitic rocks, for the most part a metamorphic series\r\nof schists, alternating with harder felsitic bands, probably originally\r\nfelsitic ashes,\" lying at the bottom of the whole pile, and he has\r\nclaimed them as pre-Cambrian. But I have not found any evidence of such\r\nrocks, nor any trace of igneous materials save dykes and sills, acid\r\nand basic, such as are indicated on the Survey map.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: _Ibid._ p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _Ibid._ p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Ibid._ p. 174.]\r\n\r\nNo one who has examined this Caernarvonshire ground can have failed\r\nto find the sections which doubtless led my predecessor to form the\r\nconvictions to which he gave expression in the passages I have just\r\nquoted. It is easy to see how these sections, wherein it is certainly\r\ndifficult to draw a sharp line between the igneous rock and the clastic\r\nmaterials derived from it, would be welcomed as appearing to offer\r\nconfirmation of the ideas concerning metamorphism which were then in\r\nvogue. There cannot, however, be any doubt that my friend was mistaken\r\nin his interpretation of the structure of that part of the country. It\r\nis to me a subject of keen regret that in his later years, when the\r\nsubject was revived, he was no longer able to re-examine this ground\r\nhimself, for no one would have confessed more frankly his error, and\r\ndone more ample justice to those who, coming after him, have been able\r\nin some parts to correct his work.\r\n\r\nThe quartz-porphyry, felsite or rhyolite of Llyn Padarn, as well as\r\nthat of Llandeiniolen, is not a metamorphic but an eruptive rock, as\r\nhas been demonstrated by Professors Hughes and Bonney. There is no\r\ntrue passage of the sedimentary rocks into it; on the contrary, the\r\nconglomerates which abut against it are in great part made out of its\r\nfragments, so that it was already in existence before these Cambrian\r\nstrata were deposited upon it. These conclusions must be regarded\r\nas wholly indisputable. But most of the critics of the work of the\r\nGeological Survey have proceeded to certain further deductions. They\r\nhave maintained that the presence of fragments of the porphyry in the\r\noverlying conglomerate marks an unconformability between the two rocks,\r\nthat the conglomerate shows the base of the Cambrian system, and that\r\nthe porphyry is therefore pre-Cambrian.\r\n\r\nThese assertions and inferences do not seem to me to be warranted. They\r\nhave, in my judgment, been disproved by Mr. Blake,[100] who shows that\r\nthere is no break in the Cambrian series, that the various porphyries\r\nand their accompaniments are parts of that series, and that there is no\r\ncertain proof of the existence of any pre-Cambrian rocks in the whole\r\ndistrict.[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: In an excellent memoir read before the Geological\r\nSociety in 1888, with the main conclusions of which I agree.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xliv. p. 271. For\r\nsubsequent papers by Mr. Blake, see _op. cit._ vols. xlviii. (1892) p.\r\n243, xlix. (1893) p. 441.]\r\n\r\nThat the igneous rocks of the Llyn Padarn area mark a volcanic period\r\nhas been recognized by most writers since Professor Bonney pointed\r\nout the flow-structure of the quartz-porphyry, and other proofs of\r\nactive volcanic eruptions have been traced by him, as well as by\r\nProfessor Hughes and Mr. Blake, in the stratified rocks which stretch\r\nnorth-eastwards to Bangor. The extent and persistence of these ancient\r\nvolcanic phenomena, and their probable connection with the remarkable\r\nnorthward attenuation of the Cambrian sedimentary rocks, deserve\r\nspecial attention.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that the rocks variously termed\r\nquartz-porphyries, felsites or rhyolites form the oldest members\r\nof this volcanic series.[102] They come to the surface in two long\r\nridges, one running from Caernarvon to near Bangor, the other from\r\nLlanllyfni to Ann's Chapel, at the mouth of Nant Francon (Map. II.).\r\nWhether the materials of these two ridges are parts of one originally\r\ncontinuous sheet or group of sheets, or, if different protrusions,\r\nwhether they belong to the same geological horizon, or whether, as Mr.\r\nBlake believes, they are distinct masses, separated by a considerable\r\nthickness of detrital material, cannot in the present state of our\r\nknowledge be positively decided. It seems to me probable that they are\r\nconnected underground, as a continuous platform beneath the overlying\r\npyroclastic materials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Whether the granitic rock of Twt Hill, Caernarvon,\r\nis connected with the porphyry or belongs to an older eruption is\r\nimmaterial for my present purpose.]\r\n\r\nThese acid rocks have been regarded by some observers as intrusive\r\nsheets, by others as lava-streams that were poured out at the surface.\r\nIf account be taken simply of their petrographical characters, they\r\nfind their nearest analogies among the intrusive quartz-porphyries\r\nof older geological periods. The presence of flow-structure in them\r\nhas been thought to indicate that they were superficial streams. But\r\nthis structure may be found in dykes and intrusive sheets as perfectly\r\nas in lava-flows, so that it cannot by itself be taken as proof of\r\na surface-discharge of lava. It must be confessed that, both in the\r\nmain mass of quartz-porphyry and in the abundant fragments of it in\r\nthe overlying conglomerates and breccias, there is an absence of such\r\nscoriform portions as one would naturally look for in a superficial\r\nlava-stream;[103] while, on the other hand, the rock generally presents\r\nthe tolerably uniform flinty texture so familiar in intrusive sheets of\r\nsimilar material.[104] My own impression is that these igneous masses\r\nwere probably erupted to the surface as long banks which rose above the\r\nwaves; that they were thus exposed to prolonged subærial and marine\r\ndenudation; that by this means any upper more cellular portions of\r\nthe lava which may have existed were broken up and pounded down into\r\ndetritus, and thus that what is now visible is a part of the eruptive\r\nrock which originally lay at some depth within its body. This view\r\nis confirmed by a study of other lavas which are found on different\r\nplatforms in the detrital deposits that overlie the Llyn Padarn\r\nquartz-porphyry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: But the Llyn Padarn rock, like many acid lavas, may\r\nnever have possessed a vesicular structure in any portion of its mass.\r\nThe sheets of felsite which occur among the overlying tuffs are not\r\ncellular, but present the closest resemblance to the main mass below.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Mr. Blake brought forward the evidence of a section on\r\nthe north or under side of the Llyn Padarn ridge to show that the rock\r\nhas there been intruded into the Cambrian strata (_Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. xliv. (1888), p. 283). But the rock supposed by him to be\r\naltered slate has been shown to be intrusive \"greenstone\" (Miss Raisin,\r\n_op. cit._ vol. xlvii. (1891), p. 336).]\r\n\r\nThat the material of each of the two main ridges is the result of more\r\nthan one eruption has been inferred from the supposed intercalation\r\nof bands of slate and of breccia in the rock.[105] Considerable\r\nlithological differences may be detected in each mass, but they are not\r\ngreater than may be observed in single sills and bosses. In some parts\r\nof the Llyn Padarn porphyry a distinct nodular structure appears which\r\nshades off into bands and lenticular streaks, reminding one of the\r\ncharacters of some of the Bala rhyolites. Other portions are markedly\r\nbrecciated, the separated fragments being surrounded in a matrix of\r\nthe rock, which shows flow-structure sweeping past them. On Moel Gronw\r\nangular fragments of a dark pinkish tint are scattered through the\r\ngeneral mass. Again, some parts are crowded with quartz-grains, while\r\nothers are comparatively free of these, and occasionally a spherulitic\r\nstructure has been observed.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: See for example, Prof. Bonney, _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. xxxv. (1879), p. 312; Mr. Blake, _op. cit._ vol. xliv.\r\n(1888), pp. 277, 287. But some at least of the supposed \"slates,\" as\r\nstated in a previous footnote, have been since shown to be dykes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Mr. Blake, _ibid._ p. 277.]\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of this ancient eruptive rock has been\r\nstudied by Professor Bonney, who found that the general type was a\r\ncompact dull grey felsite, with porphyritic crystals of felspar and\r\ngrains of quartz, closely resembling some modern rhyolites. Though\r\nunable to detect any actual glass in the base, he had no doubt that the\r\nrock was originally vitreous, and he found abundant and fresh examples\r\nof the most perfect flow-structure.[107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Op. cit._ vol. xxxv. p. 312.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Basic dyke traversing quartz-porphyry and\r\nconverted into a kind of slate by cleavage. West side of Llyn Padarn.\r\n\r\n_p_ _p_, quartz-porphyry; _d_ _d_, dyke and connected veins.]\r\n\r\nReference may be made here to the remarkable influence of the intense\r\ncleavage of the district upon this rock.[108] Along its southern\r\nmargin, where it has been exposed to pressure from the south-east, the\r\nquartz-porphyry has been so crushed that it passes here and there into\r\na fine unctuous slate or almost a schist. Nowhere can this change be\r\nmore clearly seen than on the slopes of Mynydd y Cilgwyn. The cleavage\r\nplanes strike about N. 40° E., with an inclination to dip towards\r\nthe N.W. Within a space of a few yards a series of specimens may be\r\ncollected showing at one end an ordinary or only slightly-sheared\r\nquartz-porphyry with abundant quartz-blebs, and at the other a fine\r\ngreenish sericitic slate or phyllite, wherein the quartz has been\r\nalmost entirely crushed down. Lines of shearing may be detected across\r\nthe breadth of the porphyry ridge, each of them coinciding with\r\nthe prevalent trend of the cleavage. Sometimes also certain basic\r\ndykes, which traverse the porphyry in some numbers, have undergone\r\nconsiderable deformation from the same cause. Their thinner portions\r\nare so well cleaved that they have been mistaken for included bands\r\nof green slate (Fig. 42). But these cleaved branches may sometimes be\r\ntraced into a thicker and more solid dyke, whose uncrushed cores still\r\npreserve the original character of the rock and prove it to be eruptive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The secondary planes due to cleavage must not be\r\nconfounded with the original flow-structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Section of well-cleaved tuff, grit and breccia\r\npassing up into rudely-cleaved conglomerate and well-bedded cleaved\r\nfine conglomerate and grit. East side of Llyn Padarn.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks which succeed the porphyry in the Valley of Llanberis are\r\nof great interest, for they contain abundant proof of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic activity, and they show that, so far from there being\r\nany marked hiatus here, there is evidence of the persistence\r\nof eruptions even into the time of the Llanberis Slates.[109]\r\nConsiderable misapprehension has arisen from the attempt to make one\r\nof the conglomerates the base of the Cambrian series, and the real\r\nsignificance of the volcanic detrital strata in association with it\r\nwas consequently missed. The conglomerate does not lie on one definite\r\nhorizon. In truth, there are several zones of conglomerate, each with\r\nsome difference of composition, thickness or extent.[110] These may\r\nbe well studied both on the south and the north side of the porphyry\r\nridge at the lower end of Llyn Padarn. They are intercalated among\r\nfine tuffs, grits, volcanic breccias and purple slates, sometimes full\r\nof fine ashy material. On the south-east side of the ridge, where the\r\nrocks have suffered intense cleavage, they assume a fissile unctuous\r\ncharacter, and then resemble parts of the cleaved Cambrian tuffs at\r\nSt. David's. But on the north-west side, where they have in large\r\nmeasure escaped the effects of the cleavage-movements, their original\r\nstructures are well preserved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The sections in the Vale of Llanberis on either side\r\nof Llyn Padarn have been again and again described and fought over.\r\nSome of the papers are cited in the following pages, but it would\r\nbe impossible in this volume to find room for a full discussion of\r\nthe differences of opinion. What is stated in the text is the result\r\nof my own study of the rocks on the ground, coupled with a careful\r\nconsideration of the work of other observers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: I can find no evidence of unconformability beneath any\r\nof the conglomerates. The section described by Professor Green, _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._ vol. xli. (1885), p. 74, merely shows the difference\r\nbetween the effects of cleavage on the fine tuffs and the more massive\r\nresisting conglomerate which overlies them. This section is represented\r\nin Fig. 43. At first sight the conglomerate appears to be lying on the\r\nvertical edges of an older group of slates, but any one acquainted with\r\ncleavage can trace this structure from the tuffs into the conglomerate\r\nand resuming its course again in the finer sediments above. The whole\r\nseries of deposits in the section is continuous and conformable.\r\nThe section on the slate railway has deceived Mr. Blake as well as\r\nProfessor Green (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893), p. 445).\r\nThe correct interpretation is given by Professor Bonney and Miss Raisin\r\n(_op. cit._ vol. l. p. 592).]\r\n\r\nOne of the first features of these detrital deposits to arrest\r\nattention is the amount and variety of the fragments of igneous rocks\r\nin them. Some of the conglomerates, though enclosing pebbles of quartz,\r\nquartzite, granite and other rocks not found _in situ_ in the immediate\r\ndistrict, are mainly composed of the debris of the quartz-porphyry of\r\nthe ridge. Indeed, this latter material appears to have contributed a\r\nlarge proportion of the detritus of which the general body of strata\r\nhere is made up. But there are to be noticed among the contents of\r\nthe conglomerates and breccias pieces of many volcanic rocks not\r\nto be found on the porphyry ridge. Among these, besides felsites\r\nshowing sometimes beautiful flow-structure (rhyolites) and various\r\nquartz-porphyries, there occur abundant fragments of less acid lavas\r\n(andesites) and pieces of older tuffs. Some of the fragmental rocks are\r\ngreen in colour, probably from the abundance of fine basic volcanic\r\ndust in them. Certain bands are full of large angular pieces of shale,\r\nsimilar in character to the Cambrian slates, and doubtless due to the\r\ndisruption of pre-existing Cambrian strata by volcanic explosions. It\r\nis clear that from vents in this neighbourhood there continued to be\r\nan abundant discharge of dust and various andesitic and other lapilli,\r\nwhich, falling on the sea-floor, mingled there with the ordinary\r\nmechanical sediment that was being deposited at the time.[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: On the composition of the conglomerates or breccias, see\r\nProfessor Bonney and Miss Raisin, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. l.\r\n(1894), p. 598.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Section of Clegyr on the north-east side of\r\nLlyn Padarn, near the lower end.]\r\n\r\nBut we have evidence that, during the period when these showers of\r\nvolcanic detritus were thrown out, streams of lava, though on a greatly\r\ndiminished scale, continued to be poured forth. The hill of Clegyr\r\n(Fig. 44), near the lower end of Llyn Padarn, on the north-east side,\r\nconsists mainly of cleaved tuffs (_t_) and slates with conglomerates\r\n(_c_), overlying the quartz-porphyry (_p_). Near the summit a band of\r\nfelsite is intercalated in these rocks.\r\n\r\nStill more striking are the sections on the south-west side of the\r\nlake.[112] Starting from the porphyry of the ridge, we cross a zone of\r\nconglomerate and grit largely composed of the debris of the porphyry,\r\nuntil we reach a band of felsite or quartz-porphyry, which at its\r\neastern end is about ten feet thick, while it seems to increase in\r\ndimensions westwards.[113] In the centre the rock is dark purplish-red,\r\nexceedingly compact or flinty, sprinkled with a variable proportion of\r\nquartz-blebs and felspar crystals. Towards its southern or upper edge\r\n(for the rocks, though nearly vertical, dip southwards) it has been\r\ncleaved into a variety of purple slate, and would there at once be\r\nclassed among the ordinary slates of the neighbourhood. But the fissile\r\ncharacter is merely a marginal structure which the rock shares with\r\nthe highly-cleaved tuffs that follow it. Traced westwards, this bed is\r\nfound to enclose a core of quartziferous porphyry, which, though it has\r\nescaped from the most complete results of crushing, is nevertheless\r\ncleaved along its margin as well as partially in its interior. It would\r\nnot be possible to distinguish parts of this intercalated less crushed\r\ncore from portions of the porphyry of the main ridge. The difference of\r\ncolour does not count for much, for even in this core the purple tint\r\ngives place to greenish grey, and what in the centre at the east end\r\nis a solid dark purplish-red felsite passes westward into a greenish\r\nslate, like that already noticed on Mynydd y Cilgwyn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: For various readings of these sections, compare Mr.\r\nBlake (_Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893), p. 450) with\r\nProfessor Bonney and Miss Raisin (_op. cit._ vol. l. (1894), p. 581).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: See Professor Bonney and Miss Raisin, _op. cit._ p. 593\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe microscopical examination of this rock shows it to be a true\r\nfelsite of the rhyolitic type, which in the central uncleaved part\r\nexhibits a wavy flow-structure like that found in the quartz-porphyry\r\nof the ridge. So intense has been the cleavage in its upper part that\r\nthe original structure of the rock is there effaced. The immediately\r\noverlying tuffs, which are likewise so thoroughly cleaved that it\r\nis not easy to draw a sharp and continuous line between them and\r\nthe intercalated lava, precisely resemble those found below the\r\nconglomerate on the opposite side of the lake. They include bands of\r\ncoarse volcanic breccia as well as fine compact material, showing the\r\nvarying intensity of the volcanic discharges. Their included stones\r\nconsist of various felsites, andesites and slates.[114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: I see no reason to doubt that the less acid igneous\r\nfragments were ejected during the closing phases of volcanic action,\r\neven though no such rocks have been found at the surface _in situ_.\r\nWe must remember how frequently mixtures of acid and basic materials\r\nare to be found in the same continuous series of volcanic ejections\r\nand even in the same vent, of which illustration will be given in\r\nsubsequent pages. Nor should we forget what a mere fragment of a\r\nvolcanic group is exposed at the surface in the Llanberis district. See\r\nProfessor Bonney and Miss Raisin, _op. cit._ p. 596, _footnote_.]\r\n\r\nThe thin sheet of interstratified quartz-porphyry here described is\r\nnot the only one to be found in the section. Others thinner and more\r\nintensely cleaved lie among the tuffs higher up. They have been sheared\r\ninto mere pale unctous slates, but the remains of their quartz-blebs\r\nmay still be detected in them.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs, with their interstratified bands of porphyry, become more\r\nand more mingled with ordinary argillaceous and sandy sediment as they\r\nare followed in upward succession. Among them occur bands of grit and\r\nfine conglomerate containing pebbles of porphyry and pieces of slate.\r\nSome of these grits are mainly composed of white felspar, felsite and\r\nclear grains of quartz, evidently derived from the disintegration of a\r\nrock like the porphyry of the main ridge. As the ordinary sediment of\r\nthe Llanberis group sets in, the tuffs are restricted to thinner and\r\nmore widely-separated bands. Some thin layers of felspathic breccia,\r\nseen among the slates close to the Glyn Peris Hotel, probably mark the\r\nlast discharges of the slowly-expiring vents of this region. Here,\r\nas at St. David's, from the most ancient of our volcanic records,\r\nstriking evidence is furnished of the gradual extinction of volcanic\r\naction. Through many hundreds of feet of strata which now supervene,\r\nrepresenting the closing ages of the Cambrian and the earlier ages of\r\nthe Silurian period, no trace of volcanic material has been found in\r\nthis district until we reach the Bala lavas and agglomerates of Snowdon\r\nand the Pass of Llanberis.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Bangor another area of similar rocks\r\nwraps round the northern end of the western porphyry ridge. The\r\nGeological Survey map, in conformity with the ideas that governed its\r\nrepresentation of the older rocks of Anglesey and Caernarvon, colours\r\nthese as altered Cambrian. That this error should have been made, or,\r\nwhen made, should not have been speedily corrected, is all the more\r\nsurprising when we consider the thorough mastery which the surveyors\r\nhad acquired of the aspects and the interpretation of ancient volcanic\r\nrocks in Wales, and when, moreover, we remember that as far back\r\nas 1843, long before the Survey of Caernarvonshire was published,\r\nSedgwick had pointed out the true volcanic nature of the rocks. That\r\ngreat pioneer recognized the presence of \"trappean conglomerates\" and\r\n\"trappean shales (Schaalstein)\" among these deposits at Bangor; but\r\nhe could not separate them from the Cambrian series of the rest of\r\nWales.[115] And in his section he represents them as undulating towards\r\nthe east and passing under the great mass of the Caernarvonshire slates\r\nand porphyries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: _Proc. Geol. Soc._ vol. iv. p. 212; _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ vol. iii. (1847), p. 136.]\r\n\r\nThis interpretation, which I believe to be essentially accurate, was\r\nmodified by Professor Hughes, who, fixing on a conglomerate as the base\r\nof the Cambrian system, regarded all the rocks below it, or what he\r\ntermed his \"Bangor group,\" as pre-Cambrian.[116] He has been followed\r\nin this view by subsequent writers;[117] but Mr. Blake has argued that\r\nhere, as in the Llanberis district, there is no evidence to separate\r\nthe volcanic detrital deposits above the porphyry from the Cambrian\r\nsystem.[118]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxiv. (1878), p. 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Prof. Bonney, _op. cit._ vol. xxxv. (1879), p. 316; Dr.\r\nHicks, _ibid._ p. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: _Op. cit._ vol. xliv. (1888), p. 278.]\r\n\r\nA little southward from Bangor the quartz-porphyry is overlain by\r\na most interesting group of fragmental rocks, the \"Bangor group\"\r\nof Professor Hughes. Largely of volcanic origin, they must be some\r\nhundreds of feet thick, and pass under the dark shales and grits\r\nof the Lower Silurian (Arenig) series. Some of the most persistent\r\nbands among them are conglomerates, which differ from each other in\r\ncomposition, but most of which consist largely of fragments of various\r\nigneous rocks. Some of the coarser masses might be termed agglomerates,\r\nfor they show little or no trace of bedding, and are essentially made\r\nup of blocks of volcanic material. There are abundant beds of grit,\r\nsometimes pebbly or finely conglomeratic, alternating with tuffs and\r\nwith bands of more ordinary sediment. Courses of purple shale and\r\nsandstone, green shale and dark grey sandy shale occasionally occur\r\nto mark pauses in the volcanic explosions. Perhaps the most striking\r\nfeature in the pyroclastic materials is the great abundance of very\r\nfine compact pale tuffs (hälleflintas of some writers), sometimes\r\nthinly laminated, sometimes occurring in ribbon-like bands, each of\r\nwhich presents internally a close-grained, almost felsitic or flinty\r\ntexture.[119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: The occurrence of flinty or cherty deposits, in\r\nassociation with volcanic rocks of Lower Silurian age, is well\r\nestablished in Britain, and will be more particularly referred to in\r\nthe sequel.]\r\n\r\nA cursory examination of the contents of the conglomerates, breccias\r\nand grits shows them to consist largely of different felsites, with\r\nfragments of more basic lavas. Some of these might obviously have been\r\nderived from the rock of the porphyry ridge, but, as at Llyn Padarn,\r\nthere is a far greater variety of material than can be found in that\r\nridge. Some of the fragments show perfect flow-structure. Professor\r\nBonney has described the microscopic characters of some of these\r\nfragments, and has especially remarked upon their glassy character.\r\nAmong the slides prepared from specimens collected by myself, besides\r\nthe abundant fragments of felsite (rhyolite), there are also numerous\r\npieces of different andesitic lavas and fine tuffs, as well as grains\r\nof quartz and felspar, and sometimes a good deal of granular iron-ore.\r\n\r\nThat a large proportion of the material of the so-called \"Bangor beds\"\r\nwas directly derived from volcanic explosions can hardly be doubted.\r\nThere appears to have been a prolonged succession of eruptions, varying\r\nin intensity, and somewhat also in the nature as well as in the\r\nrelative fineness of the material discharged. On the one hand, coarse\r\nmassive agglomerates were probably accumulated not far from the active\r\nvents, as the result of more violent or transient explosions; on the\r\nother hand, exceedingly fine and well-stratified tuffs, which attain\r\na great thickness, serve to indicate a phase of eruptivity marked by\r\nthe long-continued discharge of fine volcanic dust. Ordinary sediment\r\nwas doubtless drifted over the sea-bottom in this district during\r\nthe volcanic episode, but the comparative infrequence of distinct\r\ninterstratifications of shale or sandstone may be taken to imply that\r\nas a rule the pauses between the eruptions were not long enough to\r\nallow any considerable accumulation of sand or mud to take place.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory proof has yet been obtained of any interstratified\r\nlavas among the tuffs of the Bangor district. Some rocks, indeed, can\r\nbe seen on the road between the George Hotel and Hendrewen, which, if\r\nthere were better exposures, might possibly furnish the required proof;\r\nbut at present little can be made of them, for their relations to the\r\nsurrounding rocks are everywhere concealed.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have now adduced, it is obvious that while both felsitic\r\nand andesitic lavas existed within the volcanic foci, and were ejected\r\nin fragments to form the tuffs and breccias, the lavas poured out at\r\nthe surface during the Cambrian period in Caernarvonshire were mainly,\r\nif not entirely, felsites (rhyolites) in which the chief porphyritic\r\nconstituent was quartz. These lavas thus stand entirely by themselves\r\nin the volcanic history of Wales. Though felsites of various types were\r\nafterwards poured out, nothing of the same quartziferous kind, so far\r\nas we yet know, ever again appeared. Further south, in Merionethshire,\r\nas will be shown in Chapter xii., the Cambrian volcanic eruptions\r\nappear to have been on the whole less acid, and to have begun with the\r\noutpouring of andesitic lavas.\r\n\r\nI have now to consider the relation of the volcanic group of Bangor to\r\nthe strata which overlie it. The geological horizon of these strata\r\nis not, perhaps, very definitely fixed. It may be Arenig, possibly\r\neven older. But for my present purpose it will be sufficient to\r\nconsider the strata in question as lying at the bottom of the Lower\r\nSilurian series. Professors Hughes and Bonney have taken as their base\r\na marked but impersistent band of conglomerate. Mr. Blake, however,\r\nhas more recently shown that, as this band is succeeded by tuffs like\r\nthose below it, it cannot be claimed as marking the upper limit of\r\nthe volcanic group. He therefore classes it in that group and traces\r\nwhat he thinks is an overlap or unconformability at the bottom of the\r\nLower Silurian strata to the east. Mr. B. N. Peach, who accompanied\r\nme in an examination of this ground, agreed with me in confirming Mr.\r\nBlake's observation as to the position of the conglomerate, which is\r\nundoubtedly overlain by the same flinty felsitic tuffs as are found\r\nbelow it. But we were unable to trace any unconformability. According\r\nto the numerous observations which we made, there does not seem to\r\nbe any discordance in strike or dip between the flinty tuffs and the\r\noverlying shales and grits. The two groups of rock appeared to us to be\r\nconformable and to pass into each other, as at Llyn Padarn.[120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: See Mr. Blake on this point, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xlviii. (1892), p. 252, _note_. I retain the opinion expressed\r\nabove.]\r\n\r\nAn unconformable junction here would, in some respects, have been\r\nwelcome, for it would at once have accounted for the superposition of\r\nLower Silurian strata directly upon the Cambrian volcanic series, and\r\nfor the disappearance of the Llanberis slates and grits which form\r\nso conspicuous a feature above the tuffs and conglomerates at Llyn\r\nPadarn. In the absence of such a structure we must accept the order of\r\nsuccession as apparently unbroken, and rely on some such explanation\r\nas was proposed by Sir Andrew Ramsay to account for the overlap of the\r\nArenig rocks on everything older than themselves as they are traced\r\nnorthwards.[121] But this explanation will not entirely remove the\r\ndifficulties of the case. The inosculation of the volcanic group of\r\nBangor with the base of the Lower Silurian series cannot be accounted\r\nfor by any such overlap; it seems only explicable on the supposition\r\nthat the volcanic activity, which ceased in the Llyn Padarn district\r\nabout the time that the Llanberis Slates were deposited, was continued\r\nin the Bangor area until Arenig time, or was then renewed. The thick\r\nvolcanic group of Bangor would thus be the stratigraphical equivalent\r\nnot only of the thin volcanic group of Llyn Padarn, but of the\r\noverlying mass of strata up to the Arenig rocks. In confirmation of\r\nthis view, I shall show in a later chapter that volcanic action seems\r\nto have been prolonged in Anglesey to a still later geological period,\r\nthat it appeared during the deposition of the Arenig strata, and that\r\nit attained a great development throughout the time of the Bala group.\r\nThat a series of volcanic rocks, with associated cherty strata, may\r\nbe the stratigraphical equivalent of a great thickness of ordinary\r\nsediments in other districts will be dwelt upon in the description\r\nof the Lower Silurian volcanic geology of the Southern Uplands of\r\nScotland.[122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 252.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: A group of cherts and mudstones not more than 60 or 70\r\nfeet thick appear in that region to be stratigraphically equivalent to\r\nthe great depth of sedimentary material which elsewhere constitutes the\r\nUpper Arenig and Lower and Middle Llandeilo formations. See _Annual\r\nReport of the Geological Survey for 1895_, p. 27 of reprint.]\r\n\r\nIn the areas of North Wales which have now been described, volcanic\r\naction appears to have begun and ended within the limits of the\r\nCambrian period. Southwards, in the district of Dolgelly, another\r\ndistinct and, in some respects, very different development of Cambrian\r\nvolcanic activity may be recognized. In that district there is evidence\r\nthat the volcanoes which distinguished the earlier part of the Silurian\r\nperiod had already begun their eruptions during Cambrian time. As their\r\nrecords, however, are intimately linked with those of Silurian age, an\r\naccount of them is deferred to the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALVERN HILLS\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief surviving records of Cambrian volcanic action in\r\nBritain are found in Wales, there is no evidence that the volcanoes of\r\nthe period lay chiefly in that region. It is certainly a suggestive\r\nfact that, in the few districts where Cambrian strata appear from under\r\nyounger formations in England, they are generally accompanied with\r\nigneous rocks, though the age of the latter may be older or later than\r\nthe Cambrian period. If the oldest Palæozoic rocks could be uncovered\r\nover the English counties, a more abundant development of volcanic\r\nmaterials might be laid bare than is now to be seen in Wales.\r\n\r\nTaking, however, the extremely limited exposures of Cambrian strata,\r\nwe find two tracts that specially deserve attention. Reference has\r\nalready been made to the ancient eruptive rocks of the Malvern Hills,\r\nthe antiquity of which is proved by the position of the Cambrian\r\nfossiliferous strata that overlie them. But these strata themselves\r\ninclude certain igneous rocks which point to a recrudescence of\r\neruptive energy in a far later geological period.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century has passed away since John Phillips mentioned\r\nthe intercalation of igneous rocks in the series of strata which is\r\nnow classed as Upper Cambrian in the Malvern Hills. Since that date\r\nhardly anything has been added to the information which he collected.\r\nThe existence of a group of rocks of such high antiquity, asserted to\r\nbe of truly volcanic origin, and the precise horizon of which could\r\nbe fixed by the stratigraphical aid of organic remains, seems to have\r\nalmost dropped out of sight. Phillips noted the occurrence of what he\r\nregarded as truly volcanic materials in the Hollybush Sandstone and\r\nthe overlying dark (Lingula) shales, and he clearly recognized that a\r\nwide difference of age separated them from the far more ancient igneous\r\nrocks of the central core of the chain. The Hollybush Sandstones were\r\nobserved by him to have \"often a trappean aspect and to be traversed\r\nwith felspathic dykes.\" He found the overlying black shales to include\r\n\"layers of trappean ashy sandstone.\" But it was at the top of these\r\nshales that he obtained what he regarded as the most conspicuous\r\nevidence of contemporaneous volcanic action. He there encountered a\r\nzone of \"interposed trap rocks\" varying up to 50 feet in thickness,\r\nconsisting of \"porphyritic and greenstone masses, which, erupted from\r\nbelow, have flowed in limited streams over the surface of the black\r\nshales.\" He recognized amygdaloidal and prismatic structures among\r\nthem.[123] The position of these eruptive rocks is shown in Fig. 45.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. ii. part i. pp. 52, 55; also\r\nHorizontal Sections of the Geol. Survey, Sheet 13, No. 8, and Sheet\r\n15. Reference to the igneous rocks of this area will be found in the\r\nremarkable essay by De la Beche in vol. i. of the _Mem. Geol. Surv._\r\npp. 34, 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Section across the Cambrian formations of the\r\nMalvern Hills, showing the position of the intercalated igneous rocks\r\n(_p_ _p_). After Phillips.]\r\n\r\nThese rocks were afterwards observed and described by Dr. Holl, who\r\nfound what he considered to be four true lava sheets interstratified in\r\nthe Hollybush Sandstones. He noted the intercalation of \"numerous beds\r\nof volcanic ash, grit and lava\" in the black shales.[124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxi. (1865), pp. 87-91.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no more recent account of these rocks has\r\nbeen published. Their true stratigraphical and petrographical\r\nrelations require to be more precisely determined. If they are really\r\ncontemporaneous lavas, they point to volcanic eruptions at the time\r\nwhen the middle division of the Cambrian system was being deposited.\r\nIf, on the other hand, they should prove to be intrusive, they would\r\nindicate probable volcanic activity in this part of England at some\r\ntime later than the middle of the Cambrian period.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICKSHIRE\r\n\r\nSome fifty miles to the north-east of the Malvern Hills, in the\r\nheart of the rich Midlands, and among the coal-fields and the\r\nNew Red Sandstone to which these Midlands owe so much of their\r\nmanufacturing industry and their agricultural fertility, another\r\nlittle tract of Cambrian rocks rises to the surface on the east side\r\nof the Warwickshire coal-field between Nuneaton and Atherstone.\r\nSo unobtrusively do these ancient strata take their place among\r\ntheir younger peers, that their venerable antiquity was for a long\r\ntime undetected.[125] They were actually regarded as parts of the\r\nCarboniferous series, which at first sight they seem to underlie\r\nconformably. It was not until 1882 that the mistake was corrected by\r\nProfessor Lapworth, who proved the rocks to be Cambrian by finding\r\nundoubted Upper Cambrian fossils in them.[126] Subsequent investigation\r\nenabled him to work out the detailed sequence of these strata. He found\r\nthat the supposed \"Millstone Grit\" is a thick-bedded quartzite perhaps\r\n1000 feet in thickness, and resembling the well-known quartzites of\r\nthe Lickey and Caer Caradoc. The \"Coal-shales\" proved to be a series\r\n(possibly 2000 feet thick) of purple, green, grey and black shales,\r\nwhich from their fossils could be paralleled with the dark shales of\r\nthe Upper Cambrian series of the Malvern Hills.[127] These shales are\r\nimmediately overlain by the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Their antiquity was recognized by Yates as far back as\r\n1825 (_Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd series, vol. ii. p. 261). They had been\r\nconfounded with \"Millstone Grit\" and \"Coal-shale\" by Conybeare and\r\nPhillips, and this mistake was adopted on the maps and memoirs of the\r\nGeological Survey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Geol. Mag._ (1882), p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _Op. cit._ (1886), p. 319.]\r\n\r\nFor our present inquiry, however, the chief feature of interest in\r\nthese discoveries is the recognition of a group of volcanic rocks\r\nunderneath the quartzite. This group was named the \"Caldecote Volcanic\r\nRocks\" by Professor Lapworth, who first recognized its nature and\r\nrelations. Its rocks have been studied by Mr. T. H. Waller[128] and\r\nMr. F. Rutley,[129] and have been traced upon a revised edition of\r\nthe Geological Survey map by Mr. A. Strahan.[130] They consist of a\r\nthin series of well-stratified tuffs apparently derived from andesitic\r\nlavas. Their base is not seen owing to the fault which brings down the\r\nNew Red Sandstone against them. They are surmounted by the quartzite,\r\nwhich at its base is conglomeratic and contains blocks of the tuff. A\r\nmass of quartz-felsite is possibly intrusive in these strata, and is\r\nassociated with a diabase-porphyrite. In these rocks, but still more in\r\nthe shales which overlie them, numerous sills of diorite and diabase\r\noccur. The total thickness of rocks from the lowest visible part of the\r\nCaldecote volcanic series to the base of the Coal-measures is probably\r\nbetween 2000 and 3000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Op. cit._ p. 323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _Op. cit._ p. 557.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: _Geol. Mag._ (1886), p. 540. In this paper full\r\nreferences will be found to the previous papers on the geology of the\r\ndistrict. Jukes had recognized that the rocks below the coal-bearing\r\nstrata were \"older than the Upper Silurian, perhaps older than any\r\nSilurian,\" _Mem. Geol. Survey_, \"South Staffordshire Coal-field\"\r\n(1859), p. 134.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the geological position of the dark\r\nfossiliferous shales and their underlying quartzite. The fact that\r\nthe basement conglomerate of the quartzite is partly made up of the\r\nunderlying volcanic series may possibly mark a wide difference of age\r\nbetween them, and may indicate that the eruption of the tuffs took\r\nplace long before Upper Cambrian time. On the other hand, the tuffs\r\nhave the same strike and angle of dip with the quartzite, and as\r\nProfessor Lapworth admits, the break between them may not be of great\r\nmoment. It is at least certain that the intrusive sills of the district\r\nare later than the tuffs, and later also than the sedimentary Cambrian\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nTHE SILURIAN VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF THE SILURIAN SYSTEM IN BRITAIN.

They thus enable us to\r\nform a truer conception of what the early Palæozoic volcanoes were than\r\nis possible from the more limited evidence furnished by the Cambrian\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Silurian period most of the area of the British\r\nIsles lay under the sea. But if we may judge from the sedimentary\r\nstrata which represent the floor of that sea, the water, during most\r\nof the time, was of no great depth. There is evidence, indeed, that\r\nduring a part of the period the sea was deep enough to admit of the\r\naccumulation of wide tracts of radiolarian ooze, with but little\r\nadmixture of mechanical sediment. But, for the most part, sand and\r\nmud were drifted from neighbouring lands, the more important of\r\nwhich probably lay to the north, over what are now the Highlands\r\nof Scotland and the north and north-west districts of Ireland. No\r\ngeneral change in topography or in physical conditions took place at\r\nthe close of Cambrian time. The older era glided insensibly into\r\nthe newer, unmarked by any such catastrophe as was once supposed to\r\nhave intervened at the end of each great geological period. There are\r\ntraces, indeed, of slight local disturbances, but these only make the\r\ngeneral gradual transition more marked.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetation which covered the Silurian lands hardly anything\r\nis known. Traces of lycopods and ferns have been detected, and these\r\nprobably formed the chief constituents in what must have been rather a\r\nsombre and monotonous flora. The character of the terrestrial fauna is\r\nstill hidden from us, though we do know that insects winged their way\r\nthrough those green flowerless forests, and that scorpions likewise\r\nharboured there. That these primeval arachnoids were air-breathers\r\nis shown by their breathing stigmata; and from the fact that they\r\npossessed a well-developed poison-gland and sting, we may believe that\r\nthere were already living at the same time other land-animals, possibly\r\nof higher grade, on which they preyed. But of these ancestral types no\r\nactual relics have yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is the life of the sea-floor that has mainly been chronicled among\r\nthe sedimentary formations. Taking the Silurian system as a whole,\r\nwe find it to be the repository of a remarkably varied assemblage\r\nof organisms. Among the simpler forms, Radiolaria deserve especial\r\nnotice, from their wide range in space and time, and the comparative\r\nindestructibility of the highly-siliceous, fine-grained, flinty\r\nstrata, which have preserved them in abundance and have a wide\r\ndistribution over the British Isles. The Graptolites, so specially\r\ncharacteristic of the system, range entirely through it, and by their\r\nsuccessive differences of specific and generic forms, furnish a basis\r\nfor the division of the whole series of rocks into more or less\r\ndefinite stratigraphical zones. Hardly less important for purposes of\r\ncorrelation are the Trilobites which in the Silurian period reached\r\nthe culmination of their development in regard to number of species\r\nand genera. These interesting extinct types of crustacean life must\r\nhave swarmed over some parts of the sea-bottom, for their remains\r\nabound in its hardened silts. The Brachiopods are likewise numerously\r\nrepresented among Silurian strata; and since the vertical range of the\r\nspecies is generally not great, they serve as useful guides in fixing\r\nstratigraphical horizons. Lamellibranchs, Gasteropods, and Cephalopods\r\nbecome increasingly numerous and varied as we follow the succession of\r\nstrata from the base to the summit of the Silurian system. That there\r\nwere fishes also in the Silurian seas is proved by the occurrence of\r\ntheir remains, more particularly in the higher formations.\r\n\r\nFrom the organic remains which have been preserved in the rocks, it may\r\nbe inferred that the animal life of the globe became more varied in\r\nSilurian time; higher types made their appearance, until vertebrates\r\ntook the place of pre-eminence which they have ever since maintained.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic activity that had marked the passage of Cambrian time\r\nin Britain was prolonged into the Silurian period. In North Wales,\r\nindeed, it is clear that though the eruptions began in the earlier era\r\nof geological history they continued to be comparatively feeble until\r\nthey broke out into full activity in the succeeding epoch. There is no\r\nhiatus or essential difference between the volcanic phenomena, any more\r\nthan there is between the sedimentary deposits, of the two periods.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be only owing to the fact that the Silurian formations\r\ncome much more extensively to the surface of the land than the\r\nunderlying Cambrian are permitted to do, yet it is at least noteworthy\r\nthat the relics of Silurian volcanoes are spread over a far wider area\r\nof the British Isles than those of the earlier period. Throughout a\r\nlarge part of Wales they form some of the most prominent mountains,\r\nsuch as Cader Idris, the Arans, Arenig Fawr, Moel Wyn, Moel Siabod,\r\nand Snowdon. They rise into the picturesque hill-groups of the Lake\r\nDistrict, they appear at many detached places throughout the south of\r\nScotland, and form conspicuous eminences in Carrick. In Ireland they\r\nabound all down the east side of the island, and even reappear on the\r\nfar western headlands of the Dingle coast-line.\r\n\r\nTo the same pioneers, by whom the foundations of our knowledge of the\r\nCambrian volcanoes were laid, we are indebted for the first broad\r\noutlines of the history of volcanic action in Silurian time. The\r\nwritings of Sedgwick and Murchison, but still more the detailed mapping\r\nof De la Beche, Ramsay, Selwyn, Jukes, and the other members of the\r\nGeological Survey, have given to the Silurian volcanic rocks of Wales\r\na classic interest in the history of geology. To these labours further\r\nreference will be made in subsequent pages.[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: For references to the older literature see _ante_, p.\r\n142.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of material being so ample for the compilation of a\r\nrecord of volcanic action in Britain during Silurian time, it will\r\nbe desirable to arrange it in stratigraphical order. For this\r\npurpose invaluable assistance is afforded by the evidence of organic\r\nremains, whereby the whole Silurian system has been subdivided into\r\nsections, each characterized throughout the whole region by certain\r\ndistinctive fossils. The following tabular statement exhibits the chief\r\nstratigraphical divisions of the system, and the short black lines in\r\nit mark the positions of separate volcanic platforms in each of the\r\nthree kingdoms:--\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                                       |England| Wales |Scotland|Ireland|\r\n  +---------------------------------------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |               { Ludlow Group          |  ...  |  ...  |   ...  |  ...  |\r\n  |Upper Silurian { Wenlock Group         |  ...  |  ...  |   ...  |  ---  |\r\n  |               { Llandovery Group      |   ?   |  ...  |   ...  |  ...  |\r\n  |                                       |       |       |        |       |\r\n  |               { Bala and Caradoc Group|  ---  |  ---  |  ---   |  ---  |\r\n  |Lower Silurian { Llandeilo Group       |  ---  |  ---  |  ---   |  ---  |\r\n  |               { Arenig Group          |  ---  |  ---  |  ---   |  ---  |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nIt will be most convenient, following the combined stratigraphical and\r\ngeographical arrangement of this table, to discuss first the volcanic\r\nhistory of the Lower Silurian period as recorded in each of the three\r\nkingdoms, and then that of the Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE ERUPTIONS OF ARENIG AGE\r\n\r\n\r\ni. MERIONETHSHIRE\r\n\r\nPlacing the upper limit of the Cambrian system at the top of the\r\nTremadoc group, we pass into the records of another series of volcanic\r\neruptions which marked various epochs during the Silurian period over\r\nthe area of the British Isles. The earliest of these volcanic episodes\r\nhas left its memorials in some of the most impressive scenery of North\r\nWales. To the picturesque forms sculptured out of the lavas and ashes\r\nof that early time, we owe the noble range of cliffs and peaks that\r\nsweeps in a vast semicircle through the heights of Cader Idris, Aran\r\nMawddwy, Arenig, and Moel Wyn. To the east other volcanic masses,\r\nperhaps in part coeval with these, rise from amidst younger formations\r\nin the groups of the Berwyn and Breidden Hills, and the long ridges of\r\nthe Shelve and Corndon country. Far to the south, traces of Silurian\r\nvolcanoes are met with near Builth, while still more remote are the\r\nsheets of lava and tuff interstratified among the Lower Silurian rocks\r\nof Pembrokeshire, and those which extend into Skomer Island.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these districts is unquestionably that of\r\nMerionethshire. In this area, as was pointed out in the last chapter,\r\nthe eruptions certainly began before the close of the Cambrian period,\r\nfor traces of them occur in the Tremadoc and Lingula Flag groups.\r\nBut below these strata, in the vast pile of grits and conglomerates\r\nof the Harlech anticline, there does not appear to be any trace of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic action.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Geological Survey maps of this region were\r\nprepared, the Cambrian and Lower Silurian rocks had not been subdivided\r\ninto the various palæontological groups which are now recognized.\r\nNor had any attempt been made to separate the various kinds of\r\ncontemporaneous igneous masses from each other and from the tuffs in so\r\nextensive and complicated a mountain-region. The task undertaken by the\r\nSurvey was beset with difficulties, some of which geologists, furnished\r\nwith the advantages of a later time, can hardly perhaps realize. The\r\nimperfections of the mapping were long ago recognized by the original\r\nsurveyors, and various corrections of them were made from time to time.\r\nFirst of all, the volcanic rocks, which originally had been all massed\r\nunder one colour, were traced out separately on the ground, according\r\nto their structure and mode of origin, and were distinguished from each\r\nother on the maps.[132] Subsequently divisional lines were followed\r\nout between some of the larger stratigraphical groups, the maps and\r\nsections were still further modified, and the results were summed up in\r\nthe volume on the _Geology of North Wales_.[133] But short of actually\r\nresurveying the whole of that rugged tract, it was impossible to bring\r\nthe maps abreast of the onward march of science. They consequently\r\nremain, as a whole, very much as they were some thirty or forty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 95, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Some of the modifications introduced are, I think, to\r\nbe regretted, for the earlier editions of the maps and sections are in\r\ncertain respects more accurate than the later. On this point I concur\r\nwith the criticism made by Messrs. Cole and Jennings, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. xlv. (1889), p. 436.]\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Ramsay, in his great Monograph on the geology of North\r\nWales, has described the Merionethshire volcanic district in\r\nconsiderable detail. He seems finally to have come to the conclusion\r\nthat the eruptions of that area were included within the Arenig\r\nperiod.[134] He shows, indeed, that on Rhobell Fawr the ejected\r\nmaterials lie directly on disturbed Lingula Flags without the\r\nintervention of the Tremadoc group, which is nevertheless present\r\nin full development in the near neighbourhood.[135] And in trying\r\nto account for this remarkable fact he evidently had in his mind\r\nthe possibility that volcanic eruptions had taken place long before\r\nas well as after the beginning of the deposition of the Arenig grit\r\nand slates.[136] He seems eventually, however, to have looked on the\r\nRhobell Fawr sections as exceptional and possibly to be accounted\r\nfor by some local disturbance and intrusion of eruptive rock.[137]\r\nHe clearly recognized that there were two great epochs of volcanic\r\nactivity during the Silurian period in Wales, one belonging to the\r\ntime of the Arenig, the other to that of the Bala rocks, and he\r\npointed out that the records of these two periods are separated by\r\na thick accumulation of sedimentary strata which, being free from\r\ninterstratifications of contemporaneous igneous rocks, may be taken\r\nto indicate a long interval of quiescence among the subterranean\r\nforces.[138]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. iii. 2nd ed., p. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: The ashes and agglomerates of Rhobell Fawr can be seen\r\nin various places to rest on the highest members of the Lingula Flags.\r\nSee Messrs. Cole and Holland, _Geol. Mag._ (1890), p. 451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Op. cit._ p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: He was disposed to regard Rhobell Fawr as one of the\r\ngreat centres of eruption of the district. See _Memoir of A. C.\r\nRamsay_, p. 81, and _Geology of North Wales_, 2nd edit. p. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Op. cit._ pp. 71, 96, 105.]\r\n\r\nThe lower limit of the Arenig rocks has been fixed at a band or bands\r\nof grit or conglomerate (Garth grit) which can be followed with some\r\nslight interruptions all round the great dome of Cambrian strata from\r\nLlanegrin on the south to the shore at Criccieth on the north. The\r\nvolcanic group doubtless lies, generally speaking, above that basement\r\nplatform. But, besides the sections at Rhobell Fawr just referred\r\nto, where the volcanic materials lie on the Lingula Flags, the same\r\nrelation may, I think, be observed on the north flank of Cader Idris.\r\nMessrs. Cole, Jennings, and Holland have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe eruptions began at a rather earlier date than that assigned to them\r\nin the _Survey Memoirs_, and my own examination of the ground led me to\r\naccept their conclusion.[139] I inferred that the earliest discharges\r\nin the southern part of the region took place in Cambrian time, at or\r\npossibly before the close of the deposition of the Lingula Flags, and\r\nthat intermittent outbursts occurred at many intervals during the time\r\nwhen the Tremadoc and Arenig rocks were deposited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlv. (1889), p. 436;\r\n_Geol. Mag._ (1890), p. 447. _Pres. Address Geol. Soc._ 1890, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nImportant confirmation of this view of the Cambrian age of the earlier\r\nvolcanic eruptions of the Cader Idris region has recently been obtained\r\nby Messrs. P. Lake and S. H. Reynolds who, in the ground intervening\r\nbetween the lower slopes of Cader Idris and Dolgelly, have ascertained\r\nthe existence of a marked band of andesitic lava traceable for some\r\ndistance in the upper Lingula Flags. They have also observed a higher\r\nvolcanic group reposing upon the Tremadoc strata at the top of the\r\nCambrian system, and consisting of rhyolite with rhyolite-tuffs.[140]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. lii. (1896), p. 511.]\r\n\r\nSome of the most stupendous memorials of the earlier eruptions are to\r\nbe seen in the huge mountain mass of Rhobell Fawr (2403 feet). They\r\nconsist mainly of agglomerates and tuffs, one of the most remarkable\r\nvarieties of which is distinguished by its abundant scattered crystals\r\nof hornblende and of augite. The fragments of rock included in these\r\nrocks are scoriæ and lumps of various lavas, especially basaltic and\r\ntrachytic andesites. The tuffs become finer towards the top of the\r\nmountain where they are interleaved with grits. Among the pyroclastic\r\nmaterials occasional lavas (basaltic andesites) occur which may be\r\ncontemporaneous streams, but most of the lava-form rocks appear to\r\nbe intrusive. They include dolerites (augite-aphanites), basaltic\r\nandesites, and trachytic andesites.[141]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: Prof. Cole, _Geol. Mag._ (1893), p. 337.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Section across Rhobell Fawr.[142]\r\n\r\nL L, Lingula flags; _t_, tuffs and ashy slates; _s_, slates and grits;\r\nF F, Arenig volcanic series; D, dolerite.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: After Messrs. Cole and Holland, _Geol. Mag._ (1890), p.\r\n450.]\r\n\r\nThe materials from the Rhobell Fawr volcano are clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom those of the Arenig volcanoes in the neighbourhood. The latter\r\nbegin to make their appearance among the black slates at the base of\r\nthe northern declivities of Cader Idris, and extend upward through that\r\nmountain into the country beyond.\r\n\r\nAn upper limit to this volcanic group is not easily traceable; partly,\r\nno doubt, from the gradual cessation of the eruptions and partly from\r\nthe want of any marked and persistent stratigraphical horizon near the\r\ntop of the group. Sir Andrew Ramsay, indeed, refers to the well-known\r\nband of pisolitic iron-ore as lying at or near to the top of the\r\nArenig rocks.[143] There can be no doubt, however, that the volcanic\r\nintercalations continue far above that horizon in the southern part of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. iii. 2nd edit. pp. 249, 250.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the extent to which the volcanic masses of the Arenig\r\nperiod have been covered by later Palæozoic formations, it is still\r\npossible to fix approximately the northern, western, and southern\r\nlimits of the district over which the ashes and lavas were distributed.\r\nThese materials die out as they are traced southwards from Cader\r\nIdris and north-westwards from Tremadoc.[144] The greatest diameter\r\nof ground across which they are now continuously traceable is about\r\ntwenty-eight miles. They attain their greatest thickness, upwards\r\nof 5000 feet, in Aran Mawddwy, which rises from their most easterly\r\nescarpment. We may therefore infer that the main vent or vents lay\r\nsomewhere in that direction. The noble range of precipices facing\r\nwestwards shows how greatly the limits of the volcanic rocks have been\r\nreduced by denudation. There can be little doubt that at least the\r\nfiner tuffs extended westwards as far as a line drawn from Tremadoc to\r\nLlanegrin--that is, some fifteen miles or more beyond the cliffs of\r\nAran Mawddwy, thus stretching across much of the site of what is now\r\nthe great Harlech anticline.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Op. cit._ p. 96.]\r\n\r\nThis compact, well-defined volcanic area, in spite of the faults\r\nwhich traverse it and the disturbed positions into which its rocks\r\nhave been thrown, is, in many respects, one of the simplest and most\r\neasily studied among the Palæozoic formations of this country. Its main\r\nfeatures have been delineated on the maps of the Geological Survey\r\nand have been described in Sir Andrew Ramsay's monograph. But these\r\npublications cannot be regarded as more than a first broad, though\r\nmasterly, outline of the whole subject. There is an ample field for\r\nfurther and more minute research wherein, with the larger and better\r\nOrdnance maps now available, and with the advantage of the numerous\r\nmodern petrographical aids, a more exhaustive account may be given of\r\nthe district. The whole volcanic succession from base to summit is laid\r\nbare in innumerable magnificent natural sections along ranges of hills\r\nfor a distance of some forty miles, and a careful study and re-mapping\r\nof it could not fail to add greatly to our knowledge of the early\r\nhistory of volcanic action.[145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: The excellent papers of Professor Cole, Mr. Jennings,\r\nMr. Holland, Mr. G. J. Williams, Mr. P. Lake and Mr. S. H. Reynolds are\r\nillustrations of how the published work of the Geological Survey may be\r\nmodified and elaborated.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of the Geological Survey, the Arenig\r\nvolcanic rocks of Merionethshire naturally arrange themselves in\r\nthree great bands, each of which is described as tolerably persistent\r\nthroughout the whole district:--1st, a lower series of ashes and\r\nconglomerates, sometimes 3300 feet thick (Aran Mawddwy); 2nd, a\r\nmiddle group of \"felstones\" and \"porphyries,\" consisting partly of\r\ntrue contemporaneous lava-streams and partly of intrusive sheets, and\r\nreaching a thickness of 1500 feet; 3rd, an upper series of fragmental\r\ndeposits like that beneath, the extreme thickness of which is 800 feet\r\n(Arenig mountain). A re-mapping of the ground on the six-inch maps\r\nwould, no doubt, show many local departures from this general scheme.\r\n\r\nThe pyroclastic members of this volcanic series present many features\r\nof interest both to the field-geologist and the petrographer; but\r\nthey have as yet been only partially studied. At the southern end of\r\nthe district it is remarkable to what a large extent the earliest\r\neruptions must have been mere gaseous explosions, with the discharge\r\nof comparatively little volcanic material. Many of the tuffs that are\r\ninterstratified with black slates (? Lingula Flags) at the foot of\r\nthe long northern slope of Cader Idris, consist mainly of black-slate\r\nfragments like the slate underneath, with a variable proportion of grey\r\nvolcanic dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 47.--Section at the Slate Quarry, Penrhyn Gwyn, north slopes\r\n     of Cader Idris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying section (Fig. 47) represents the arrangement of the\r\nrocks exposed at the Slate Quarry of Penrhyn Gwyn. About 50 feet of\r\nblack slate (_a_) are there seen, the bedding in which dips S. at\r\n20°, while the cleavage is inclined towards S.W. at a slightly higher\r\nangle. The next 20 feet of slate (_b_) are distinguished by many\r\nintercalations of slate-tuff or breccia, varying from less than an inch\r\nto three feet in thickness. An intrusive sheet of andesite (_c_), which\r\nvaries from two or three to ten feet in thickness, and is strongly\r\ncellular in the centre, interrupts the slates and hardens them. Above\r\nthis sill the indurated slate and tuff (_d_), containing abundant\r\nfelspar crystals, pass under a flinty porphyritic felsite (_e_) or\r\nexceedingly fine tuff, enclosing a band of granular tuff. Beyond this\r\nband the black slates with their seams of tuff continue up the hill and\r\ninclude a sheet of slaggy felsitic lava 8 or 10 feet thick.\r\n\r\nThis section, affording as it does the first glimpse of the volcanic\r\nhistory of Cader Idris, indicates a continued series of feeble gaseous\r\ndischarges, probably from one or more small vents, whereby the black\r\nclay on the sea-floor was blown out, the fragments falling back again\r\nto be covered up under a gradual accumulation of similar dark mud. By\r\ndegrees, as the vigour of eruption increased, lava-dust and detached\r\nfelspar crystals were ejected, and eventually lava rose to the surface\r\nand flowed over the sea-bottom in thin sheets.\r\n\r\nBut elsewhere, and likewise at a later period in this same southern\r\npart of the district, the fragmental discharges consisted mainly\r\nof volcanic material. Sir Andrew Ramsay has described the coarse\r\nconglomerates composed of subangular and rounded blocks of different\r\n\"porphyries,\" sometimes 20 inches in diameter, embedded in a fine\r\nmatrix of similar materials. The true nature of the component fragments\r\nin these rocks has still to be worked out.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Cole and Jennings have noticed that the grey volcanic dust of\r\nthe older slate-tuff of Cader Idris is seen under the microscope \"to\r\nabound in particles of scoriaceous andesite-glass, now converted into\r\na green palagonite.\"[146] Their investigations show that while the\r\nsame kinds of volcanic rocks continue to be met with from the bottom\r\nto the top, nevertheless there is an increase in the acid character of\r\nthe lapilli as the section is traced upwards. Some of the fragments\r\nconsist of colourless devitrified glass, with pieces of pumice, as\r\nif derived from the breaking up of previously-formed tuffs. Others\r\nresemble quartz-andesites, rhyolites, or trachytes, while in at\r\nleast one instance, somewhat low down in the section, quartz-grains\r\nwith intruded material point to the existence of some fairly acid and\r\nvitreous lava.[147] On the south side of Llyn Cau, that is towards the\r\ntop of the volcanic group, I found a coarse agglomerate with blocks of\r\nfelsitic lavas, sometimes three feet across (see Fig. 48). This gradual\r\nincrease of acidity in the lapilli of the tuffs finds an interesting\r\nconfirmation in the contemporaneous lava-sheets to which I shall\r\nafterwards allude.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. xlv. (1889), p. 424;\r\n_Geol. Mag._ (1890), p. 447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: _Op. cit._ p. 429. A tuff lying below the ironstone near\r\nCross Foxes, east of Dolgelly, likewise contains fragments of trachytic\r\nlavas.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable features in the tuffs of this volcanic\r\ngroup is the great abundance of entire and broken crystals dispersed\r\nthrough them. These crystals have certainly not been formed _in situ_,\r\nbut were discharged from the vents as part of the volcanic dust. They\r\nusually consist of felspar which, at least in the southern portion of\r\nthe district, appears generally to be plagioclase. Frequent reference\r\nto these crystals as evidence of volcanic explosions may be found in\r\nthe publications of the Survey. Nowhere can they be better seen than\r\nin the black slate-tuffs of Cader Idris. They are there white, more or\r\nless kaolinized, and as they lie dispersed through the black base, they\r\ngive the rock a deceptive resemblance to some dark porphyry. The large\r\ncrystals of hornblende and augite abundantly scattered through much of\r\nthe tuff of Rhobell Fawr have been already referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the central parts of the district thick bands of ashes were mapped\r\nby the Survey, and described as consisting almost wholly of volcanic\r\nmaterials, but containing occasional thin bands of slate which suffice\r\nto mark pauses in the eruptions, when ordinary sediment was strewn\r\nover the sea-bottom. In the Cader Idris ground, on the other hand,\r\ninterstratifications of non-volcanic material are of such frequent\r\nrecurrence as to show that there, instead of constant and vigorous\r\ndischarges accumulating a vast pile of ashes, the eruptions followed\r\neach other after intervals of sufficient duration to allow of the usual\r\ndark sediment spreading for a depth of many feet over the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting deposits of these interludes of quiescence\r\nis that of the pisolitic ironstone and its accompanying strata on\r\nthe north front of Cader Idris (_i_ in Fig. 48). A coarse pumiceous\r\nconglomerate with large slag-like blocks of andesite and other rocks,\r\nseen near Llyn-y-Gadr, passes upward into a fine bluish grit and shale,\r\namong which lies the bed of pisolitic (or rather oolitic) ironstone\r\nwhich is so widely diffused over North Wales. The finely-oolitic\r\nstructure of this band is obviously original, but the substance was\r\nprobably deposited as carbonate of lime under quiet conditions of\r\nprecipitation. The presence of numerous small _Lingulæ_ in the rock\r\nshows that molluscan life flourished on the spot at the time. The\r\niron exists in the ore mainly as magnetite, the original calcite or\r\naragonite having been first replaced by carbonate of iron, which was\r\nsubsequently broken up so as to leave a residue of minute cubes of\r\nmagnetite.[148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Messrs. Cole and Jennings, _op. cit._ p. 426.]\r\n\r\nAbove the ironstone some more blue and black shale and grit pass under\r\na coarse volcanic conglomerate like that below, lying at the base of\r\nthe high precipice of Cader Idris. Hence this intercalated group of\r\nsedimentary strata marks a pause in the discharge of ashes and lavas,\r\nduring which the peculiar conditions of sedimentation indicated by the\r\nironstone spread over at least the southern part of the volcanic area.\r\nSome few miles to the east, where the ironstone has been excavated near\r\nCross Foxes, the band is again found lying among tuffs and grits full\r\nof volcanic lapilli.\r\n\r\nBetween a lower and an upper band of tuff in the Arenig volcanic group\r\nthe Maps and Memoirs of the Geological Survey distinguish a central\r\nzone of \"felspathic porphyry,\" which attains a maximum thickness of\r\n1500 feet (see Fig. 48). From Sir Andrew Ramsay's descriptions, it is\r\nclear that he recognized in this zone both intrusive and extrusive\r\nsheets, and that the latter, where thickest, were not to be regarded\r\nas one mighty lava-flow, but rather as the result of successive\r\noutpourings, with occasional intervals marked by the intercalation of\r\nbands of slate or of tuff. To a certain extent the intruded sheets are\r\nseparated on the map from the contemporaneous lavas; but this has been\r\ndone only in a broad and sketchy way. One of the most important, and\r\nat the same time most difficult, tasks yet to be accomplished in this\r\ndistrict is the separation of the rocks which were probably poured\r\nout at the surface from those that were injected underneath it. My\r\nown traverses of the ground have convinced me that good evidence of\r\nsuperficial outflows may be found in tracts which have been mapped as\r\nentirely intrusive; while, on the other hand, some of the so-called\r\n\"lavas\" may more probably be of the nature of sills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Sketch-section across Cader Idris.\r\n\r\n_st_, slates and tuffs and ashy slates; _s_, slates and grits; _i_,\r\nironstone; _b_, volcanic breccias; _a_, slaggy andesitic and more basic\r\nlavas; _e_, microgranite or eurite; _f_, felsites; _d_, \"greenstone\"\r\n(dolerites, diabases, etc.).]\r\n\r\nThe petrography of the rocks, moreover, still requires much study.\r\nAmong the so-called \"felspathic porphyries\" of the Survey maps a\r\nconsiderable variety of texture, structure and composition will\r\ndoubtless be detected. In the _Descriptive Catalogue of Rock-Specimens\r\nin the Museum of Practical Geology_ (3rd edit., 1862) the rocks\r\nthat form the \"lava-streams of Llandeilo age,\" in Merionethshire,\r\nare named \"felstone,\" \"felspar-porphyry,\" \"felstone-porphyry,\"\r\n\"felspathic-porphyry,\" and \"calcareous amygdaloid.\"\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature which my own slight personal acquaintance\r\nwith the region has brought before me is the clear evidence of a\r\nsuccession from comparatively basic lavas in the lower part of the\r\ngroup to much more acid masses in the higher part. In the Survey map\r\nnumerous sheets of intrusive \"greenstone\" are shown traversing the\r\nLingula Flags, Tremadoc slates, and lower part of the volcanic group\r\nalong the northern slopes of Cader Idris. The true intrusive nature of\r\nmuch of this material is clearly established by transgressive lines of\r\njunction and by contact-metamorphism, as well as by the distinctive\r\ncrystalline texture of the rocks themselves. But the surveyors were\r\nevidently puzzled by some parts of the ground. Sir Andrew Ramsay\r\nspeaks of \"the great mass of problematical vesicular and sometimes\r\ncalcareous rock which is in places almost ashy-looking.\" After\r\nseveral oscillations of opinion, he seems to have come finally to the\r\nconclusion that this vesicular material, which occurs also in the upper\r\npart of the mountain, passes into, and cannot be separated from, the\r\nundoubted intrusive \"greenstones.\"[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 36; see also\r\npp. 31, 32.]\r\n\r\nThe true solution of the difficulty will be found, I believe, in the\r\nrecognition of a group of scoriaceous lavas among these greenstones.\r\nThe presence of a cellular structure might not be sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate that the rocks in which it appears are true lava-beds,\r\nfor such a structure is far from unknown both among dykes and sills.\r\nBut in the present case there is other corroborative testimony that\r\nsome of these Cader Idris amygdaloids were really poured out at the\r\nsurface. Below Llyn-y-Gadr--the dark tarn at the foot of the vast\r\nwall of Cader Idris--the beds of coarse volcanic conglomerate (_b_\r\nin Fig. 48), to which I have already alluded, are largely composed\r\nof blocks of the vesicular \"greenstones\" on which they lie. These\r\n\"greenstones,\" moreover, have many of the most striking characteristics\r\nof true lavas (_a_ in Fig. 48). They are extraordinarily cellular;\r\ntheir upper surfaces sometimes present a mass of bomb-like slags with\r\nflow-structure, and the vesicles are not infrequently arranged in rows\r\nand bands along the dip-planes.\r\n\r\nA microscopic examination of two slides cut from these rocks shows them\r\nto be of a trachytic or andesitic type, with porphyritic crystals of a\r\nkaolinized felspar embedded in a microlitic groundmass. The rocks are\r\nmuch impregnated with calcite, which fills their vesicles and ramifies\r\nthrough their mass.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the east some remarkable felsitic rocks take the place\r\nof these vesicular lavas immediately below the pisolitic iron ore. I\r\nhave not determined satisfactorily their relations to the surrounding\r\nrocks, and in particular am uncertain whether they are interbedded\r\nlavas or intrusive sheets. Dr. F. H. Hatch found that their microscopic\r\ncharacters show a close resemblance to the soda-felsites described by\r\nhim from the Bala series of the south-east of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of Cader Idris are partly obscured with debris, from above\r\nwhich rises the great precipitous face formed by the escarpment of\r\n\"porphyry,\" here intrusively interposed among the Arenig volcanic\r\nrocks. This enormous sill will be referred to a little further on in\r\nconnection with the other intrusive sheets of the region.\r\n\r\nThe remarkably cellular rock which forms the peak of Cader Idris is\r\ncoloured on the Survey map as an intrusive sill of \"greenstone,\" which\r\nin the Memoir is said to alter the contiguous slates and to appear to\r\ncut across them diagonally. I am disposed, however, to think that these\r\nappearances of intrusion are deceptive. On the southern declivity of\r\nthe mountain this rock presents one of the most curious structures\r\nto be seen in the whole district. Its surface displays a mass of\r\nspheroidal or pillow-shaped blocks aggregated together, each having\r\na tendency to divide internally into prisms which diverge from the\r\noutside towards the centre.[150] Some portions are extremely slaggy,\r\nand round these more solid portions finely crystalline parts are drawn,\r\nsuggestive rather of free motion at the surface than of the conditions\r\nunder which a subterranean sill must be formed. The idea occurred to\r\nme on the ground that while the band of rock marked as \"greenstone\" on\r\nthe map is probably, in the main, an interstratified lava, there may\r\nnevertheless be basic intrusions along its course, as in the lower part\r\nof the mountain. The minute structure of this amygdaloid, as revealed\r\nby the microscope, shows it to be an epidiorite wherein the hornblende,\r\nparamorphic after augite, has been again partially altered along the\r\nmargins into chlorite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: This peculiar structure of the more basic Arenig\r\nlavas, where the rock looks as if built up of irregularly-spheroidal,\r\nsack-like or pillow-shaped blocks, will be again referred to in\r\nconnection with the Arenig (and Llandeilo) lavas of Scotland and\r\nIreland. It appears to be widely distributed, and especially in\r\nconnection with the occurrence of radiolarian cherts. The black slate\r\nabove the Cader Idris amygdaloid would, in a similar position in\r\nScotland, be associated with such cherts, but these have not yet been\r\nnoticed at this locality. With the spheroidal internally-radiating\r\nprismatic structure of the Cader Idris rock, compare that of the lava\r\nat Acicastello already noticed on p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe highest lavas of Cader Idris, forming the ridge to the south of\r\nLlyn Cau, are separated from the amygdaloid just described by a thick\r\nzone of black slate with thin ashy intercalations, beyond which comes\r\nthe coarse volcanic agglomerate already referred to as containing\r\nblocks of felsite a yard or more in diameter. These lavas are true\r\nfelsites, sometimes beautifully spherulitic and exhibiting abundant\r\nflow-structure, like some of the felsites of the next or Bala volcanic\r\nperiod.[151] The petrography of these rocks still remains to be worked\r\nout.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Messrs. Cole and Jennings, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xlv. (1889), p. 430. From the examination of slices prepared from\r\na few of the felsites of the Dolgelly district, Dr. Hatch observed a\r\n\"striking difference between their characters and those of the Cambrian\r\nfelsites of Caernarvonshire. The porphyritic constituent is now no\r\nlonger quartz, but felspar (plagioclase), and the rocks belong, not to\r\nthe rhyolitic, but rather to the less acid trachytes, perhaps even to\r\nthe andesites.\"]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic series of Cader Idris sweeps northward through the chain\r\nof Aran and Arenig, and then curves westward through the group of\r\nManod and Moelwyn, beyond which it rapidly dies out. In its course\r\nof about 45 miles it undergoes considerable variation, as may be\r\nseen by comparing a section through Moelwyn with that through Cader\r\nIdris already given. According to the researches of Mr. Jennings and\r\nMr. Williams,[152] the main mass of volcanic material in the northern\r\npart of the region consists of fragmentary rocks varying in texture\r\nfrom agglomerates into fine tuffs, but showing some differences in the\r\nsuccession of beds in different localities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891), p. 368.]\r\n\r\nThe Tremadoc group of strata clearly underlies the volcanic series of\r\nthese more northerly tracts. But it contains, so far as appears, no\r\nintercalation of volcanic material. The inference may thus be drawn\r\nthat the eruptions began in the Cader Idris district, and did not\r\nextend into that of Manod and Moelwyn until after the beginning of\r\nthe Arenig period. Above the Tremadoc group lies the well-marked and\r\npersistent band, about 13 feet thick, known as the Garth grit, which\r\nhas been already referred to as a convenient base-line to the Arenig\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Section across the Moelwyn Range.[153]\r\n\r\n  1, Tremadoc Group; 2, Garth or Arenig grit (base of Arenig group);\r\n     3, Arenig slates, etc.; 3^1, Lower slate band; 3^2, Middle slate\r\n     band; 3^3, Upper slate band; 4^1, Lower agglomerate; 4^2, Middle\r\n     agglomerate; 4^3, Upper agglomerate; 5, Llandeilo group; G,\r\n     Granite boss of Moel tan y Grisiau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: After Messrs. Jennings and Williams, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. xlvii. (1891), p. 371, and Horizont. Sect. Geol. Surv.\r\nSheet 28.]\r\n\r\nIn this northern district, among the sediments which overlie the\r\nGarth grit, layers of fine tuff begin to make their appearance, which\r\nnorth of Cwm Orthin thicken out into a considerable mass between\r\nthe grit and the lowest of the great agglomerates. These tuffs,\r\nwhich mark the beginning of the volcanic eruptions of the district,\r\nare followed by a band of slate which in some places has yielded\r\na _Lingula_, _Orthis Carausii_, and a _Tetragraptus_, and points\r\nto an interval of quiescence in the volcanic history. We now enter\r\nupon an enormous thickness of agglomerates and tuffs separated by\r\nseveral bands of slate. Taking advantage of the slaty intercalations,\r\nMessrs. Jennings and Williams have divided this great accumulation of\r\nfragmentary volcanic material into three beds (Fig. 49). The matrix\r\nof the agglomerates is compact and pale, so as to resemble and to\r\nhave been called \"felstone,\" but showing its fragmentary nature on\r\nweathered surfaces. The blocks imbedded in this paste range up to\r\nsometimes as much as 11 feet in length by 4 feet in width. Their minute\r\npetrographical characters have not been studied, but the blocks are\r\nstated to consist for the most part of \"slaty and schistose fragments\r\nmixed with rounded pebbles of fine-grained 'felstone.'\" They are heaped\r\ntogether as in true agglomerates. In the upper agglomerate, fragments\r\nof cleaved slate containing _Lingula_ have been observed.\r\n\r\nThe name of \"felstone\" is restricted by Messrs. Jennings and Williams\r\nto certain fine-grained varieties of rock, of which a thin band lies\r\nat the base of the lower agglomerate, while another of considerably\r\ngreater importance occurs in the middle of the upper agglomerate. These\r\nbands consist of a fine compact greenish base, and weather with a dull\r\nwhite crust; sometimes, as in the thicker sheet, a columnar structure\r\nshows itself. Whether these rocks are to be regarded as lavas or sills,\r\nor even as finer varieties of tuff, is a question that awaits further\r\ninquiry. But it is clear, from the investigation of the two observers\r\njust cited, that the pyroclastic constituents must vastly preponderate\r\nin the volcanic series over the northern part of the region. All these\r\nrocks, whether coarse or fine-grained, appear to be rather acid in\r\ncomposition, and no evidence has yet been obtained of a sequence among\r\nthem from a more basic to a more acid series, as in Cader Idris.\r\n\r\nThe highest agglomerate bed of the Manod and Moelwyn area is covered by\r\nslates which contain Llandeilo graptolites. In this way, by means of\r\npalæontological evidence, the upward and downward limits of the Arenig\r\nvolcanic series in this part of Wales are definitely fixed.\r\n\r\nHardly any information has yet been obtained as to the situation and\r\ncharacter of the vents from which the lavas and ashes of Merionethshire\r\nwere discharged. In the course of the mapping of the ground, the\r\nGeological Survey recognized that, as the greatest bulk of erupted\r\nmaterial lies in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the region,\r\nthe chief centres of emission were to be looked for in that quarter,\r\nand that possibly some of the intrusive masses which break through the\r\nrocks west of the great escarpment may mark the site of vents, such as\r\nTyddyn-rhiw, Gelli-llwyd-fawr, Y-Foel-ddu, Rhobell Fawr, and certain\r\nbosses near Arenig.[154] The distribution of the volcanic materials\r\nindicates that there were certainly more than one active crater. While\r\nthe southward thickening of the whole volcanic group points to some\r\nspecially vigorous volcano in that quarter, the notable thinning away\r\nof the upper tuffs southward and their great depth about Arenig suggest\r\ntheir having come from some vent in this neighbourhood. On the other\r\nhand, the lower tuffs are absent at Arenig, while on Aran Mawddwy, only\r\nnine miles to the south, they reach a depth of 3000 feet. Still farther\r\nto the south these volcanic ejections become more and more divided by\r\nintercalated bands of ordinary sediment. One of the most important\r\nvolcanoes of the region evidently rose somewhere in the neighbourhood\r\nof what is now Aran Mawddwy. There seems reason to surmise that the\r\nsites of the chief vents now lie to the east and south of the great\r\nescarpment, buried under the thick sedimentary formations which cover\r\nall that region.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 98; see also\r\npp. 44, 54, 58, 71.]\r\n\r\nIf we are justified, on stratigraphical and petrographical grounds, in\r\nconnecting the lowest volcanic rocks of the Berwyn range with those\r\nof Merionethshire, we may speculate on the existence of a group of\r\nsubmarine vents, coming into eruption at successive intervals, from\r\nsome epoch during the period of the Lingula Flags up to that of the\r\nBala rocks, and covering with lavas and ashes a space of sea-bottom\r\nat least forty miles from east to west by more than twenty miles from\r\nnorth to south, or roughly, an area of some 800 square miles.[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: The Berwyn Hills, however, will be described in later\r\npages as a distinct volcanic district.]\r\n\r\nBesides the materials ejected to the surface, the ancient volcanic\r\nregion of Merionethshire was marked by the intrusion of a vast amount\r\nof igneous rock between and across the bedding-planes of the strata\r\ndeep underground. One of the most prominent features of the Geological\r\nSurvey map is the great number of sills represented as running with\r\nthe general strike of the strata, especially between the top of the\r\nHarlech grits and the base of the volcanic series. On the north side of\r\nthe valley of the Mawddach, between Barmouth and Rhaiadr Mawddach, in\r\na distance of twelve miles the Survey mapped \"more than 150 intrusions\r\nvarying from a few yards to nearly a mile in length.\"[156] This zone\r\nof sills is equally marked on the south side of the valley. It may be\r\ntraced all round the Harlech anticline until it dies out, as the bedded\r\nmasses also do, towards Towyn on the south and about Tremadoc on the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of such a zone of intrusive sheets at the base of an\r\nancient volcanic series is a characteristic feature in the geology of\r\nBritain. It is met with again and again among the Palæozoic systems,\r\nand appears on a striking scale in association with the Tertiary\r\nbasaltic plateaux of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides. But nowhere,\r\nperhaps, is it more strongly developed than beneath the Arenig group of\r\nlavas and tuffs in North Wales. Abundant as are the protrusions marked\r\non the Geological Survey map, they fall short of the actual number to\r\nbe met with on the ground. Indeed, to represent them as they really are\r\nwould require laborious surveying and the use of maps on a far larger\r\nscale than one inch to a mile.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of these sills are basic rocks, or, in the old\r\nand convenient terminology, \"greenstones.\" Those of the Cader Idris\r\ndistrict have been examined by Messrs. Cole and Jennings, who found\r\nthat, notwithstanding the considerable alteration everywhere shown\r\nby the abundant epidote and calcite, the coarser varieties may be\r\nrecognized as having originally been dolerites approaching gabbro, with\r\na well-developed ophitic character, the general range of structure\r\nbeing from dolerites without olivine and aphanites to andesitic\r\nrocks with an originally glassy matrix.[157] Dr. Hatch confirmed\r\nthis diagnosis from slides prepared from my specimens. The ophitic\r\nstructure is usually characteristic and well preserved, in spite of the\r\nalteration indicated by epidote, chlorite, uralite, and leucoxene.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlv. (1889), p. 432.]\r\n\r\nThat this zone of \"greenstone\" sills belongs to the period of the\r\nMerionethshire volcanoes may be reasonably concluded. The way in which\r\nthey follow the line of the great escarpment, their almost entire\r\nabsence from the Cambrian dome to the west, their cessation as the\r\noverlying lavas and tuffs die out laterally, and their scarcity above\r\nthe lower part of the volcanic group, seem to indicate their close\r\nrelationship to that group. Moreover, that they must have been as a\r\nwhole later than the main part of the lavas and tuffs may be inferred\r\nfrom their position. The molten material of which they were formed\r\ncould hardly have forced its way between and across the strata unless\r\negress to the surface had been impeded by some thick overlying mass.\r\nThe \"greenstones\" may therefore be regarded as lateral emanations from\r\nfunnels of more basic lava towards the close of the volcanic period.\r\nPossibly some at least of the highly slaggy and vesicular bands to\r\nwhich I have referred may represent portions of this material, which\r\nactually flowed out as streams of lava at the surface.\r\n\r\nBut there is likewise evidence of extensive intrusion of more\r\nsiliceous rocks. On the Geological Survey map, besides the numerous\r\n\"greenstones,\" various sheets of \"felspathic porphyry\" are represented\r\nas running with the general strike of the region, but here and there\r\nbreaking across it. One of the most remarkable of these acid sills is\r\nthat which, in the noble precipice of Cader Idris, has a thickness of\r\nabout 1500 feet and a length of three or four miles. It is shown on the\r\nmap to be transgressive across other rocks, and, as seen on the ground,\r\nit maintains the uniformity of texture which is characteristic rather\r\nof sheets that have solidified underneath than of those which have\r\ncongealed with comparative rapidity at the surface. On a fresh fracture\r\nthe rock presents a pale bluish-grey tint, becoming yellowish or\r\nbrownish as the result of weathering. Its texture is finely granular,\r\nwith occasional disseminated felspars. Under the microscope a section\r\nof it was found by Dr. Hatch to exhibit the characteristic structure\r\nof a microgranite, a confused holocrystalline aggregate of quartz and\r\nfelspar, with a few porphyritic felspars. Messrs. Cole and Jennings\r\nhave proposed to revive for this rock Daubuisson's name \"Eurite.\"[158]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Mr. Harker speaks of the rock as a granophyre.]\r\n\r\nA similar rock occurs at a lower horizon among the Lingula Flags at\r\nGelli-llwyd-fawr, two miles south-west of Dolgelly,[159] and much\r\nmicrogranite has been injected along the slopes above Tyddyn-mawr.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Messrs. Cole and Jennings, _op. cit._ p. 435.]\r\n\r\nThe chronological relation of these acid sheets and bosses to the more\r\nbasic intrusions has not yet been definitely determined. That some of\r\nthem may have solidified in vents and may have been directly connected\r\nwith the protrusion of the later or more highly siliceous lavas is not\r\nat all improbable. Others again would seem to belong to a much later\r\ngeological period than the Arenig volcanoes. In this late series the\r\nwell-known boss of Tan-y-grisiau near Festiniog should probably be\r\nincluded. This mass of eruptive material was mapped by the Geological\r\nSurvey as \"intrusive syenite.\" It has been more recently examined\r\nand described by Messrs. Jennings and Williams as a granitite.[160]\r\nThese observers have noticed not only that it intrusively traverses\r\nand alters the Tremadoc group, but that its intrusion appears to have\r\ntaken place subsequent to the cleavage which affects the Llandeilo\r\nas well as older formations. This granitic boss has thus probably no\r\nconnection with the Arenig volcanoes, but belongs to a later period in\r\nthe volcanic history of the Principality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvii. (1891), p. 379.]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable scarcity of dykes in the volcanic districts of Wales\r\nhas been noticed by more than one observer. Among the intrusive\r\n\"greenstones\" of Merionethshire some occasionally assume the dyke\r\nform, and through the agglomerates and tuffs of Rhobell Fawr dykes\r\nof olivine-diabase have worked their way. In the Festiniog district\r\nvarious altered andesitic dykes have been noted. But there has been no\r\nwidespread fissuring of the ground and uprise of lava in the rents,\r\nsuch as may be seen in the Archæan gneiss, and in the later Palæozoic,\r\nbut still more in the Tertiary volcanic regions. This feature becomes\r\nall the more notable when it is viewed in connection with the great\r\ndevelopment of sills, and the evidence thereby afforded of widespread\r\nand extremely vigorous subterranean volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIn the Merionethshire region there certainly was a long period of\r\nquiescence between the close of the Arenig and the beginning of the\r\nBala eruptions. Moreover, no evidence has yet been found that active\r\nvents ever again appeared in that district, the subterranean energy\r\nat its next outburst having broken out farther to the east and north.\r\nIn Anglesey, however, where, as I shall point out, there is proof of\r\ncontemporaneous tuffs among the Arenig rocks, it is possible that a\r\ncontinuous record of volcanic action may yet be traced from Arenig well\r\nonward into Bala time.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. SHROPSHIRE\r\n\r\nAbout 35 miles to the south-east of the great volcanic range of\r\nMerionethshire a small tract of Arenig rocks rises from amidst younger\r\nformations, and forms the picturesque country between Church Stoke and\r\nPontesbury. Murchison in his excellent account of this district clearly\r\nrecognized the presence of both intrusive and interstratified igneous\r\nrocks.[161] The ground has in recent years been more carefully worked\r\nover by Mr. G. H. Morton[162] and Professor Lapworth.[163]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Silurian System_ (1839), chap. xix.; _Siluria_, 4th\r\nedit. (1867), pp. 26, 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _Proc. Liverpool Geol. Soc._ x. (1854), p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: _Geol. Mag._ (1887), p. 78.]\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Arenig group of this district lies a zone of\r\nwell-stratified andesitic tuff and breccia (Stapeley Ash), with\r\nfrequent intercalations of shales, and occasionally fossiliferous.[164]\r\nThere is thus satisfactory proof of contemporaneous eruptions at\r\nintervals during the accumulation of the later Arenig sediments. That\r\nthere were also outflows of lava is shown by the presence of sheets\r\nof augite- and hypersthene-andesite. These volcanic intercalations\r\nform marked ridges, having a general northerly trend. They are folded\r\nover the broad laccolitic ridge of Corndon, on the east side of which\r\nthey are thrown into a synclinal trough, so that successive parallel\r\noutcrops of them are exposed. According to the mapping of the\r\nGeological Survey they are thickest towards the west, and become more\r\nsplit up with intercalated sediments as they range eastward.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Prof. Lapworth and Mr. W. W. Watts, _Proc. Geol. Assoc._\r\nxiii. (1894), pp. 317, 337.]\r\n\r\nVolcanic eruptions in this Shropshire region continued from the Arenig\r\ninto the Bala period. They are marked among the Llandeilo strata by\r\noccasional tuffs and by two massive beds of \"volcanic grit,\" described\r\nby Murchison,[165] but they appear to have been rather less vigorous in\r\nthe interval represented by this subdivision of the Silurian system.\r\nThose of Bala time gave forth abundant discharges of ash, of which\r\nthe lowest accumulation, locally known as the Hagley Ash, consists of\r\nandesitic detritus. Occasional layers of tuff are intercalated in the\r\noverlying Hagley Shales, above which comes an important band called\r\nthe Whittery Ash, \"consisting of andesitic and rhyolitic breccias\r\nand conglomerates, fine ashes with curious spherulitic or pisolitic\r\nstructures, and bands of shale often fossiliferous.\"[166] It is evident\r\nthat the eruptions of the Shelve district came from independent\r\nvents in that neighbourhood, and never reached the importance of the\r\ngreat volcanoes of Arenig age in Montgomeryshire or of Bala age in\r\nCaernarvonshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: _Silurian System_, p. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: Messrs.

They\r\nconsist chiefly of hypersthene-dolerite. They appear to belong to a\r\nmuch later period than the interstratified volcanic series; at least\r\nsome of them are found altering the Pentamerus limestones, and these\r\nmust be later than the Llandovery rocks.[168] The most important sill\r\nis that which forms Corndon, the central igneous mass of the district.\r\nThis body of dolerite was ascertained by Mr. Watts not to be a boss\r\nbut a laccolite, which wedges out both towards the north-west and\r\nsouth-east, as shown in Fig. 50.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Op. cit._ p. 339.]\r\n\r\nSix miles to the north of the Shelve and Corndon district the Breidden\r\nHills rise on the border of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire, and include\r\na mass of volcanic material belonging to a distinct area of eruption.\r\nIn the ridge that extends for about three and a half miles through\r\nMoel-y-golfa and Middletown Hill, a synclinal trough of volcanic rocks\r\nlies upon shales, which from their fossils have been placed in the Bala\r\ngroup. The volcanic series appears to exceed 1000 feet in thickness.\r\nThe lowest part of it on Moel-y-golfa consists of andesitic lavas about\r\n400 feet thick, followed by tuffs and volcanic conglomerates. The lavas\r\nresemble some of the \"porphyrites\" of the Old Red Sandstone, and\r\ncontain two forms of pyroxene--one rhombic, probably enstatite, and\r\nthe other monoclinic augite. There are likewise considerable masses of\r\nintrusive rock, which are varieties of diabase or dolerite.[169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: See Mr. W. W. Watts on the Igneous and Associated Rocks\r\nof the Breidden Hills, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xli. (1885), p.\r\n532.]\r\n\r\n\r\niii. SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of England we must in imagination transport ourselves\r\ninto the Southern Uplands of Scotland, where a widely distributed\r\nseries of Silurian volcanic rocks has been preserved. It was, until\r\nrecently, supposed that the Silurian system north of the Tweed contains\r\nno contemporaneously erupted volcanic rocks. Yet, as far back as the\r\nyear 1860, I pointed to the abundant existence of volcanic detritus in\r\nthese strata throughout the southern counties as a probable indication\r\nof volcanic activity at the time and in the area within which the\r\nstrata were deposited.[170] Some years later, when the microscope\r\nhad been introduced as an aid to field-geology, I sliced some of\r\nthe Silurian sediments of that region and found them, particularly\r\ncertain shales and grits of Moffatdale, to contain a large admixture\r\nof perfectly fresh unworn felspar crystals, which I felt tolerably\r\ncertain had been supplied by volcanic explosions. As no trace, however,\r\nhad then been detected of an intercalated volcanic group in any part\r\nof the Silurian series of the south of Scotland, I used at that time\r\nto speculate on the possibility of the volcanic detritus having been\r\nwind-borne from the volcanoes of the Lake District. I had at that time\r\nno suspicion that its source was rather to be sought under my feet.\r\nThe presence of volcanic rocks underneath the uplands of the south\r\nof Scotland would have been a welcome explanation of the frequent\r\nfelspathic composition of many of the Silurian greywackes and shales of\r\nthat region, and particularly the abundance of andesitic and felsitic\r\nfragments in them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxii. (1860), p. 636.]\r\n\r\nIt had been long known that the Scottish Silurian formations, besides\r\nhaving undergone extensive plication, have also been injected by\r\nprotrusions of igneous material of various kinds. The intrusive\r\ncharacter of many of these is so obvious that a similar origin was\r\nattributed even to those bosses which could not be proved to be\r\nintrusive. Recent work of the Geological Survey, however, and more\r\nespecially the numerous and careful traverses of my friend and\r\ncolleague Mr. Peach, have revealed the unlooked-for and important fact\r\nthat a large number of these supposed intrusions are really portions of\r\na volcanic group brought up on the crests of anticlinal folds, and laid\r\nbare by denudation. This group can be traced for at least 100 miles\r\nfrom north-east to south-west over a belt of country sometimes 30 miles\r\nbroad. Its original limits cannot be ascertained, but they obviously\r\nexceeded those within which the rocks can now be seen. Nevertheless\r\nthe present boundaries embrace an area of nearly 2000 square miles.\r\nThis Palæozoic volcanic region is thus one of the most extensive in\r\nthe British Isles. Owing, however, to the constant plication of the\r\nstrata, and the wide space which the overlying sedimentary deposits\r\nare thus made to cover, the volcanic group only comes occasionally\r\ninto view, and thus occupies but a mere fraction of the superficial\r\nextent of the region over which its scattered outcrops appear. These\r\nexposures, sometimes only a few square yards in extent, may always\r\nbe looked for where the anticlinal folds bring up a sufficiently low\r\nportion of the Silurian system; they prove that a vast volcanic floor\r\nunderlies the visible Lower Silurian grits and shales over the length\r\nand breadth of the Southern Uplands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWithout anticipating details which will properly appear in the\r\nofficial _Memoirs_ of the Geological Survey, I may briefly indicate\r\nthe visible boundaries of the volcanic group, and refer to some of the\r\nlocalities where it may best be seen. The most easterly points where\r\nit has been recognized by Mr. Peach stand on the crests of some sharp\r\nanticlinal folds near St. Mary's Loch and near Leadburn and Winkstone\r\nin Peeblesshire. Farther westwards it appears at many places along the\r\nnorthern border of the Silurian territory, as at Romanno Bridge, Wrae,\r\nKilbucho, Culter Water and Abington, the length and breadth of each\r\nexposure depending partly on the breadth of the anticline and partly on\r\nthe depth to which it has been cut down by denudation. Near Sanquhar\r\nthe volcanic series opens out for a breadth of more than a mile, and\r\nis seen at intervals across the wild moorlands of Carrick, until from\r\nthe Stinchar valley it widens out seaward and occupies much of the\r\ncoast-line of Ayrshire between Girvan and the mouth of Loch Ryan. It\r\nprobably rises again along a fold near Portpatrick, and it is seen at\r\nvarious points along the southern borders of the Silurian uplands, as\r\nnear Castle-Douglas, at Glenkiln, Bell Craig near Moffat, and the head\r\nof Ettrickdale.\r\n\r\nThe best sections are those exposed along the coast to the north\r\nand south of Ballantrae. When that ground was first examined by the\r\nGeological Survey, the hypothetical views in regard to metamorphism\r\nalready referred to were in full ascendant, and the rocks were mapped\r\non the same general principles as those which had been followed in\r\nWales. Professor Bonney, however, a few years later recognized the true\r\nigneous nature of many of the rocks. He found among them porphyrite\r\nlavas and agglomerates which he regarded as of Old Red Sandstone age,\r\nlikewise intrusive serpentines and gabbros.[171]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxiv. (1878), p. 769.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rocks of this wide district include both lavas and\r\ntheir pyroclastic accompaniments, as well as intrusive sills and\r\nbosses of various materials. They have recently been studied by Mr.\r\nJ. J. H. Teall, and full descriptions of them by him will appear\r\nin a forthcoming volume of the _Memoirs_ of the Geological Survey.\r\nHe has ascertained that though generally more or less decomposed,\r\nthe lavas would be classed by German petrographers as diabases and\r\ndiabase-porphyrites. The former are compact dark-green non-porphyritic\r\nrocks, often containing numerous small spherical amygdales; while the\r\nlatter are markedly porphyritic, enclosing large phenocrysts of more\r\nor less altered plagioclase, often measuring half an inch across.\r\nThese two groups of rock are connected by transitional varieties.\r\nThey were probably, in the first instance, composed of plagioclase,\r\naugite, iron-ores, and a variable quantity of imperfectly crystallized\r\ninterstitial matter.\r\n\r\nSome of these rocks closely resemble in outward appearance the\r\nandesites (\"porphyrites\") of the Old Red Sandstone of the district\r\nnot many miles to the north, that is, fine purplish-red rocks with\r\na compact base through which porphyritic felspars are abundantly\r\nscattered. Occasionally they are markedly slaggy, and show even a ropy\r\nsurface, while the breccias associated with them contain blocks of\r\nsimilar slag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Structure in finely-amygdaloidal diabase lava,\r\nsouth of mouth of Stinchar River, Ayrshire. The fine dots and circles\r\nmark the lines of amygdales.]\r\n\r\nBut the most characteristic external feature of these lavas is their\r\ntendency to assume irregularly-elliptical, sack-like or pillow-shaped\r\nforms. On a weathered face they sometimes look like a pile of\r\npartially-filled sacks heaped on each other, the prominences of one\r\nprojecting into corresponding hollows in the next. The general aspect\r\nof this structure is shown in Fig. 12, which represents a face of rock\r\nabout eight feet high and six feet broad. The rocks exhibiting this\r\npeculiarity are usually finely amygdaloidal, and it may be observed\r\nthat the vesicles are grouped in lines parallel to the outer surface\r\nof the pillow-like block in which they occur. The diagram in Fig. 51\r\nrepresents in ground-plan a surface about twelve feet square on the\r\nshore immediately to the south of the mouth of the River Stinchar.\r\nIn the heart of the spheroids enclosed fragments of other lavas are\r\nsometimes observable.\r\n\r\nThis singular structure has already (p. 184) been referred to as\r\nstrikingly displayed in a rock at the top of Cader Idris. It is found\r\nin dark basic lavas probably of Arenig age, which will be afterwards\r\nreferred to as occurring along the southern flanks of the Scottish\r\nHighlands and also in the north of Ireland. It has been observed by\r\nMr. Teall among the rocks of the Lizard, and has been described as\r\noccurring in Saxony and California.[172] In these different localities\r\nit is associated with jaspers and cherts, some of which contain\r\nabundant Radiolaria. The same structure has been found among the\r\nvariolitic diabases of Mont Genèvre,[173] and likewise in some modern\r\nlavas, as in that of Acicastello already referred to (_ante_, p. 26).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Mr. J. J. H. Teall, _Roy. Geol. Soc. Cornwall_, 1894, p.\r\n3. Mr. L. Ransome, _Bull. Depart. Geol. University of California_, vol.\r\ni. p. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Messrs. Cole and Gregory, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xlvi. (1890), p. 311.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--View of Knockdolian Hill from the east.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic agglomerates and breccias, in the south-west of Ayrshire,\r\nattain a great development in several centres probably at or near the\r\noriginal volcanic vents. They present several distinct petrographical\r\ntypes. The remarkable neck-like hill of Knockdolian in the Stinchar\r\nValley is made of a coarse breccia composed mainly of angular pieces of\r\ndull greyish-green fine-grained diabase. The breccias and agglomerates\r\nof Bennane Head in some parts consist largely of broken-up shales,\r\nflinty mudstone, black radiolarian flint or chert, and abundant\r\nfragments of andesites and felsites. In other parts the volcanic\r\nmaterial predominates, including angular and subangular fragments of\r\nvarious somewhat basic lavas, lumps of vesicular slag and pieces of\r\npumice. Here and there much calcite is diffused through the matrix in\r\nstrings, veins and patches, which enclose the lapilli. The agglomerate\r\nnorth of Lendalfoot possesses a greenish, somewhat serpentinous\r\nmatrix, through which immense numbers of tabular felspar crystals are\r\nscattered. Similar crystals also occur abundantly in embedded blocks\r\nof one of the purplish diabase-porphyrites, which occurs in mass on\r\nthe shore and inland, and closely resembles the rock of Carnethy in the\r\nOld Red Sandstone volcanic series of the Pentland Hills.\r\n\r\nYet another and very distinct type of agglomerate is to be seen on the\r\nMains Hill south-east of Ballantrae. It is a coarse rock, enclosing\r\nblocks up to a yard or more in diameter, of a fine compact purplish\r\nporphyrite, with large crystals of plagioclase and smaller ones of\r\naugite. In some places immense numbers of the small lapilli in the\r\nmatrix consist of an extremely fine vesicular pumice. Small perfect and\r\nlarger broken crystals of augite are likewise abundant in some of the\r\ngreenish, more basic parts of the mass. These greenish serpentinous\r\nparts and the numerous augite crystals point to the explosion of some\r\ntolerably basic pyroxenic lava. A similar dark green, almost black,\r\nrock, with augite crystals, which sometimes measure a quarter of an\r\ninch in diameter, occurs near Sanquhar in Nithsdale. It presents a\r\nclose resemblance to the agglomerate of Rhobell Fawr, already alluded\r\nto. So far as these Scottish agglomerates have yet been microscopically\r\nexamined, they have been found to be composed of crystals,\r\ncrystal-fragments, and lapilli derived partly from lavas similar to\r\nthose above described, and partly from felsitic and other rocks which\r\nhave not yet been observed here in the form of lavas.\r\n\r\nThe finer tuffs show likewise a considerable range of composition.\r\nAccording to Mr. Peach's observations along the south-eastern parts of\r\nthe volcanic area, the ejected materials have consisted largely of fine\r\ndust (probably in great measure felsitic), which towards the north-east\r\nis gradually interleaved with ordinary sediment till the ashy character\r\ndisappears. As I have already remarked, there is reason to believe that\r\nthe overlying greywackes and shales derived part of their material\r\neither directly from volcanic explosions or from the attrition of banks\r\nof lavas and tuffs exposed to denudation.\r\n\r\nBut besides the interstratified lavas and fragmental rocks there occur\r\nnumerous intrusive masses which are so intimately associated with the\r\nvolcanic series that they may with little hesitation be regarded as\r\nforming part of it. They consist of various gabbros and serpentines,\r\nwhich are especially developed where the volcanic series comes out in\r\ngreatest force in the south-west of Ayrshire. They also include more\r\nacid intrusions which, as in the case of the rock of Byne Hill, near\r\nGirvan, even assume the characters of granite.\r\n\r\nThe dying out of the volcanic material towards the north-east probably\r\nindicates that the vents of the period lay rather in the central\r\nor south-western parts of the district. Unfortunately, the limited\r\nextent of the exposures of the rocks makes it a hopeless task to\r\nsearch for traces of these vents over by far the largest part of the\r\narea. There are two localities, however, where the search may be\r\nmade with better prospect of success. One of these is a tract to the\r\nnorth of Sanquhar in Nithsdale, which still requires to be studied in\r\ndetail with reference to the sequence and structure of its volcanic\r\nrocks. The other area is that south-western part of Ayrshire which\r\nhas been already cited as displaying so large a development of the\r\nvolcanic series. Here the coast-sections reveal the intercalation of\r\nfossiliferous bands which show the true stratigraphical horizons of the\r\nlavas and tuffs. Under Bennane Head, Professor Lapworth some years ago\r\nfound, in certain hardened black shales, a group of graptolites which\r\nmark an undoubted Arenig platform.[174] Recently the ground has been\r\ncarefully re-examined by Messrs Peach and Horne, who have detected a\r\nnumber of other fossiliferous zones which confirm and extend previous\r\nobservations. They have also been able to unravel the complicated\r\nstructure of the volcanic series, and to represent it on the 6-inch\r\nmaps of the Geological Survey, of which a reduction on the scale of 1\r\ninch to a mile is now in course of preparation. The following tabular\r\nsummary, taken partly from notes made by myself during a series of\r\ntraverses of the ground with Mr. Peach when the revision was begun, and\r\npartly from memoranda supplied by that geologist himself, may suffice\r\nas a general outline of the volcanic history of this exceedingly\r\ninteresting and important region.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: _Geol.

Possibly its\r\nvisible portions represent merely the closing scenes of a long volcanic\r\nhistory, which, over the area of the south of Scotland, extended into\r\nCambrian time, like the contemporary series of Cader Idris.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowest lavas there are interstratified courses of fine\r\ntuffs, flinty shales and thin limestones, which sometimes fill in the\r\nhollows between the pillow-like blocks above referred to. Among the\r\ncharacteristic Lower Arenig graptolites of these intercalated layers\r\nare _Tetragraptus bryonoides_, _T. fruticosus_, _T. quadribrachiatus_,\r\nand _T. Headi_ together with _Caryocaris Wrightii_. Considerable\r\nvariation is to be seen in the development of the upper part of the\r\nvolcanic series. In some places the lavas ascend almost to the top;\r\nin others, thick masses of breccia or agglomerate take their place.\r\nThese fragmentary materials are locally developed round particular\r\ncentres, which probably lie near the sites of active vents whence\r\nlarge quantities of pyroclastic material were discharged. One of the\r\nvolcanic centres must have been situated close to the position of\r\nKnockdolian Hill already referred to. The exceedingly coarse breccia\r\nof that eminence is rudely stratified in alternations of coarser and\r\nfiner material, which was probably to some extent assorted under water\r\naround the cinder-cone that discharged it. The date of the explosions\r\nof this hill has been ascertained by Mr. Peach from the intercalation\r\nof black shales containing Arenig graptolites among the breccias.\r\nAnother vent lay somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood of the Mains\r\nHill agglomerate, if not actually on part of the site of that rock.\r\nThough probably not more than a mile from the Knockdolian volcano, and\r\nbelonging to the same epoch of eruption, this vent, to judge from the\r\npeculiarities of its ejected material, must have been quite distinct\r\nin its source. A third vent lay somewhere in the immediate vicinity of\r\nBennane Head, and threw out the extraordinary masses of agglomerate and\r\nthe sheets of lava seen on the coast at that locality. A fourth may be\r\ntraced by its separate group of fine tuffs on the coast three miles\r\nsouth of Ballantrae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Section across the Lower Silurian volcanic\r\nseries in the south of Ayrshire (B. N. Peach).\r\n\r\nB, Interstratified lavas in Arenig group; _t_, tuffs; _r_, radolarian\r\ncherts; _b_^2, Llandeilo group; _b_^3 Caradoc group. Σ, Serpentine.\r\nG, Gabbro.]\r\n\r\nA feature of singular interest in the material erupted from these\r\nvarious centres of activity consists in the evidence that the\r\nexplosions occurred at intervals during the deposition of the Lower\r\nSilurian formations, and that these formations were successively\r\ndisrupted by submarine explosions. Mr. Peach has found, for example,\r\nabundant pieces of the peculiar and easily recognized radiolarian\r\ncherts imbedded in the volcanic series. That these cherts were\r\ndeposited contemporaneously with the volcanic eruptions is proved by\r\ntheir intercalation among the breccias. Yet among these very breccias\r\nlie abundant fragments of chert which must have already solidified\r\nbefore disruption. It is thus evident that this siliceous ooze not only\r\naccumulated but set into solid stone on the sea-floor, between periods\r\nof volcanic outburst, and that such an occurrence took place several\r\ntimes in succession over the same area.\r\n\r\nThese facts derive further interest from the organic origin of the\r\nchert. It is now some years since Mr. Peach and his colleagues observed\r\nthat between the Glenkiln Shale with its Upper Llandeilo graptolites\r\nand the top of the volcanic group in the central part of the Silurian\r\nuplands, alternations of green, grey or red shaly mudstones and flinty\r\ngreywackes are interleaved with fine tuffs, and are specially marked\r\nby the occurrence in them of nodules and bands of black, grey and\r\nreddish chert. This latter substance, on being submitted to Dr. Hinde,\r\nwas found by him to yield twenty-three new species of Radiolaria\r\nbelonging to twelve genera, of which half are new. It thus appears that\r\nduring the volcanic activity there must have been intervals of such\r\nquiescence, and such slow, tranquil sedimentation in clear, perhaps\r\nmoderately deep water, that a true radiolarian ooze gathered over the\r\nsea-bottom.[175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: _Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist._ (1890), 6th ser. vi. p. 40.]\r\n\r\nThat the deposition of this ooze probably occupied a prolonged lapse\r\nof time seems clearly indicated by the evidence of the fossils that\r\noccur below and above the cherts. The graptolites underneath indicate\r\na horizon in the Middle Arenig group, those overlying the cherts are\r\nunmistakably Upper Llandeilo. Thus the great depth of strata which\r\nelsewhere constitute the Upper Arenig and Lower and Middle Llandeilo\r\nsubdivisions is here represented by only some 60 or 70 feet of\r\nradiolarian cherts. These fine siliceous, organic sediments probably\r\naccumulated with extreme slowness in a sea of some depth and over a\r\npart of the sea-floor which lay outside the area of the transport and\r\ndeposit of the land-derived sediment of the time.[176]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Annual Report of the Geol. Surv. for 1895_, p. 27 of\r\nreprint.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 54.--Section of part of the Arenig volcanic group, stream\r\n     south of Bennane Head, Ayrshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of some of the characteristic features in the\r\nsuccession of deposits in the volcanic series of the south-west\r\nof Ayrshire, the accompanying section (Fig. 54) is inserted. In\r\ndescending order we come first upon a group of greywackes and grey\r\nshattery mudstones (_a_), followed by grey-green and dark banded\r\ncherts, containing Radiolaria and much plicated. Next comes a group\r\nof dark-grey, black and red cherts, with numerous partings and thin\r\nbands of tuff and volcanic conglomerate (_c_). The siliceous bands were\r\ncertainly deposited during the volcanic eruptions, and they are moulded\r\nround the rugose, slaggy upper surface of the band of lavas (_d_) on\r\nwhich they directly lie. These lavas have the sack-like or pillow\r\nstructure already described, and they enclose lumps of chert containing\r\nRadiolaria. A few yards to the west of the line of section bands of\r\nnodular tuff are interposed between the top of the lavas and the\r\noverlying cherts, with which also they are interstratified. These tuffs\r\ncontain blocks of lava six inches or more in diameter. Below the belt\r\nof lavas come black cherts and shales (_e_) succeeded below by volcanic\r\nbreccias and tuffs (_f_) alternating with shales in thin inconstant\r\ncourses. These coarse detrital rocks are thoroughly volcanic in origin,\r\nand they contain fragments of the black cherts which lie still lower in\r\nthe series. The whole depth of strata represented in this section does\r\nnot amount to much more than 100 feet.\r\n\r\nWhile in some parts of the Ayrshire district the coarse breccias\r\nthat accumulated around their parent vents form most of the upper\r\npart of the volcanic series, in others the lavas are succeeded by\r\nfine tuffs which are intercalated among the ordinary sediments, and\r\nshow a gradual decline and cessation of volcanic energy. South of\r\nBallantrae, for example, the lavas occupy more than two miles of coast,\r\nin which space they display hardly any intercalations of sedimentary\r\nmaterial, though they show more or less distinctly that they consist\r\nof many separate flows. Where they at last end, bands of nodular and\r\nfine tuff make their appearance, together with bands of ashy shale\r\nand the characteristic zone of the red radiolarian cherts or flints.\r\nAbove these, in conformable sequence, come bands of black shale,\r\ncontaining abundant Upper Llandeilo graptolites, overlain by greenish\r\nor olive-coloured shaly mudstones, which pass upward into a thick\r\noverlying group of greywackes.\r\n\r\nIn this section the alternation of fine pyroclastic with ordinary\r\nsediment shows that the volcanic eruptions in the southern part of the\r\nBallantrae district came to an end by a slowly-lessening series of\r\nexplosions. The ashy material gradually dies out, and does not reappear\r\nall through the thick group of sandy and muddy sediments which here\r\noverlies the volcanic series.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn from the evidence of the Ayrshire sections that volcanic\r\naction was in full vigour in the south-west of Scotland during the\r\nArenig period, but gradually died out before the end of the Llandeilo\r\nperiod. The rocks in which this volcanic history is chronicled have\r\nbeen very greatly disturbed and plicated, so that though from their\r\nfrequently vertical position they might be thought to attain a vast\r\ndepth, they very possibly do not exceed 500 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nAs the volcanic series is followed north-eastwards it exhibits a\r\ngradual diminution in extent and variety, but this may be at least\r\npartly due to the much less depth of it exposed on the crests of the\r\nnarrow anticlines that bring it to the surface. There is evidence in\r\nthat region that the eruptions did not everywhere terminate in the\r\nLlandeilo period, but were in some districts prolonged into the age\r\nof the Bala rocks. Thus in the neighbourhood of Sanquhar volcanic\r\nbreccias, tuffs and lavas have been found by Messrs. Peach and Horne\r\nintercalated in strata apparently belonging to the Bala group. Again,\r\nin the district of Hartfell, a moderately coarse volcanic agglomerate\r\noccurs in the heart of the so-called \"barren mudstones\" of the Hartfell\r\nblack-shale group, which, from its graptolites, is placed on the\r\nhorizon of the Bala rocks. At Winkstone, Hamilton Hill, and Wrae in\r\nPeeblesshire, perlitic felsites and soda-felsites have been detected\r\nby Messrs. Peach and Horne and determined by Mr. Teall. They are\r\nassociated with the Bala limestone, which in some of its conglomeratic\r\nbands contains pebbles of felsite.\r\n\r\nThe intrusive rocks which accompany the Lower Silurian volcanic series\r\nof the south of Scotland are best displayed in the south-west of\r\nAyrshire, between Girvan and Ballantrae, where they appear to be on the\r\nwhole later than at least the great mass of the interstratified lavas\r\nand tuffs. The most abundant rocks and the earliest to be injected are\r\ncomplex basic masses which include serpentine, olivine-enstatite rock,\r\ntroctolite, gabbro and other compounds, all which may be different\r\nmodifications of the same original basic magma. They do not show a\r\nfiner texture where they respectively meet, nor any other symptom\r\nof having been subsequently intruded into each other, though they\r\ndo exhibit such structures along their lines of contact with the\r\nsurrounding rocks, into which they are intrusive. These more basic\r\nmasses have subsequently been invaded by irregular bosses and dyke-like\r\nprotrusions, which, when small, are fine-grained dolerites, but when in\r\nlarger bodies take the form of gabbro, sometimes exhibiting a mineral\r\nbanding and foliated structure. These banded varieties much resemble\r\nthe banded Tertiary gabbros of Skye and some parts of the Lewisian\r\ngneiss.\r\n\r\nAt the Byne Hill, near Girvan, a large intrusive boss or ridge displays\r\non its outer margin a fine-grained texture, where it comes in contact\r\nwith the serpentine. Further inwards it becomes a fine dolerite,\r\npassing into gabbro and increasing in coarseness of grain as well as\r\nin acidity of composition, through stages of what in the field would\r\nbe called diorite and quartz-diorite, into a central granitic rock,\r\nwhereof milky or blue quartz forms the prominent constituent. The\r\nintrusive rocks of this district have generally been injected parallel\r\nto the stratification-planes, and take on the whole the form of sills.\r\n\r\nSome time after the close of the volcanic episode in the Silurian\r\nperiod of the south of Scotland, the rocks were locally subjected to\r\nconsiderable disturbance and elevation, whereby parts of the volcanic\r\nseries were exposed to extensive denudation. Hence the overlying\r\nunconformable Caradoc conglomerates are in some places largely made\r\nup of the detritus of the volcanic rocks. It is interesting to find\r\nthis evidence of waste during the very next stage of the Silurian\r\nperiod, for it affords good evidence that the extensive sheets of\r\nintrusive material could not have had any large amount of overlying\r\nstrata resting upon them at the time of their injection. Pieces of\r\nthese intrusive rocks, such as the serpentine, occur abundantly in the\r\nCaradoc conglomerates, some of which indeed are almost wholly composed\r\nof their detritus. Probably the total thickness of the overlying cover\r\nof rock under which the sills were injected did not amount to as much\r\nas 200 or 300 feet. Yet we see that among the sills were coarse gabbros\r\nand granitoid rocks. We may therefore infer that for the injection of\r\nsuch intrusive masses, great depth and enormous superincumbent pressure\r\nare possibly not always necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the Geological Survey along the southern borders\r\nof the Highlands, a remarkable group of rocks has been observed,\r\nintervening as a narrow interrupted strip between the schistose\r\nmasses to the north and the great boundary-fault which brings the Old\r\nRed Sandstone in vertical strata against them. Between Cortachy in\r\nForfarshire and Stonehaven on the east coast, these rocks have been\r\nmapped by Mr. G. Barrow, who has carefully worked out their relations.\r\nThey appear again between Callander and Loch Lomond, where their extent\r\nand structure have been mapped by Mr. C. T. Clough. For the purpose of\r\nour present inquiry two chief features of interest are presented by\r\nthese rocks. They include a group of sedimentary strata among which\r\noccur bands of jasper or chert containing radiolaria, and one of their\r\nmost conspicuous members is a series of volcanic rocks consisting\r\nchiefly of dolerites and basalts, some of which have been much crushed\r\nand cleaved, but in which vesicular structures can still occasionally\r\nbe recognized.\r\n\r\nThe striking resemblance of both the aqueous and igneous members of\r\nthis marginal strip of rocks along the Highland border to the Arenig\r\ncherts and their accompanying lavas in the south of Scotland, the\r\nremarkable association of the same kinds of material in the same order\r\nof sequence, the occurrence of radiolaria in the siliceous bands in\r\nboth regions, furnish strong presumptive evidence that a strip of\r\nArenig rocks has been wedged in against the Highland schists.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, these dull green diabasic lavas of the Highland\r\nborder resemble those of the Ayrshire coast. In particular, the same\r\npeculiar sack-like or pillow-shaped masses are conspicuous in the\r\nForfarshire ravines. As in Ayrshire, igneous materials underlie the\r\ncherts which are doubled over and repeated by many successive folds.\r\nUnfortunately, it is only a narrow strip of these probably Arenig lavas\r\nthat has been preserved, and no trace has been detected of tuffs,\r\nagglomerates or necks. If, however, we may regard the rocks as truly\r\nof Arenig age, they furnish interesting additional proof of the wide\r\nextent of the earliest Silurian volcanoes. The distance between the\r\nlast Arenig volcanic outcrop in the Southern uplands and the band of\r\nsimilar lavas along the margin of the Highlands is about 50 miles. If\r\nthe volcanic ejections were continuous across the intervening tract,\r\nthe total area over which the lavas and tuffs of the Arenig volcanoes\r\nwere distributed must be increased by at least 6000 square miles in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the north of Ireland that this northern extension of what\r\nmay probably be regarded as an Arenig series of volcanic rocks attains\r\nits greatest development. Of this Irish prolongation a brief account is\r\ngiven in Chapter xiv., where the whole of the Silurian volcanic rocks\r\nof the island are discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE ERUPTIONS OF LLANDEILO AND BALA AGE\r\n\r\n  i. The Builth Volcano--ii. The Volcanoes of Pembrokeshire--iii. The\r\n     Caernarvonshire Volcanoes of the Bala Period--iv. The Volcanic\r\n     District of the Berwyn Hills--v. The Volcanoes of Anglesey--vi.\r\n     The Volcanoes of the Lake District; Arenig to close of Bala\r\n     Period--vii. Upper Silurian (?) volcanoes of Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphical subdivisions of geology are necessarily more\r\nor less arbitrary. The sequence in the sedimentary deposits of one\r\nregion always differs in some degree from that of adjoining regions.\r\nIn drawing up a table of stratigraphical equivalents for separate\r\ncountries, we must be content to accept a general parallelism, without\r\ninsisting on too close an identity in either the character of the\r\nstrata or the grouping of their organic remains. We need especially to\r\nguard against the assumption that the limit assigned to a geological\r\nformation in any country marks a chronological epoch which will\r\npractically agree with that denoted by the limit fixed for the same\r\nformation in another country. The desirability of caution in this\r\nrespect is well shown by the vagueness of the horizons between the\r\nseveral subdivisions of the Lower Silurian system. So long as the\r\nareas of comparison are near each other, no great error may perhaps\r\nbe committed if their stratigraphical equivalents are taken to have\r\nbeen in a broad geological sense contemporary. But in proportion as\r\nthe element of distance comes in, there enters with it the element of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nEven within so limited a region as the British Isles, this difficulty\r\nmakes itself strongly felt. Thus, in the typical regions of Wales, the\r\nseveral subdivisions of the Lower Silurian strata are tolerably well\r\nmarked, both by lithological nature and by fossils. But as they are\r\nfollowed into other parts of the country, they assume new features,\r\nsometimes increasing sometimes diminishing in thickness, changing their\r\nsedimentary character, and altering the association or range of their\r\norganisms. The subdivisions into which the geologist groups them may\r\nthus be vaguely defined by limits which, in different parts of the\r\nregion, may be far from representing the same periods of time.\r\n\r\nHence, in trying to ascertain how far the volcanic eruptions of one\r\narea during the Silurian period may have been contemporary with those\r\nof another area, we must be content to allow a wide margin for error.\r\nIt is hardly possible to adhere strictly to the stratigraphical\r\narrangement, for the geological record shows that in the volcanic\r\ndistricts the sedimentary formations by which the chronology might have\r\nbeen worked out are not infrequently absent or obscure. It will be more\r\nconvenient to treat the rest of the Lower Silurian formations as the\r\nrecords of one long and tolerable definite section of geological time,\r\nwithout attempting in each case to distinguish between the eruptions\r\nof the successive included periods, so long as the actual volcanic\r\nsequence is distinctly kept in view. I will therefore take the history\r\nof each district in turn and follow its changes from the close of the\r\nArenig period to the end of Upper Silurian time. The stages in the\r\nvolcanic evolution of each tract will thus be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nAbove the Arenig group with its voluminous volcanic records comes the\r\ngreat group of sediments known as the Llandeilo formation, in which\r\nalso there are proofs of contemporaneous volcanic activity over various\r\nparts of the sea-floor within the site of Britain. We have seen that\r\nin the south of Scotland the eruptions of Arenig time were probably\r\ncontinued into the period of the Llandeilo rocks, or even still later\r\ninto that of the Bala group. But it is in Wales that the history of the\r\nLlandeilo volcanoes is most fully preserved. A series of detached areas\r\nof volcanic rocks, intercalated among the Llandeilo sediments, may be\r\nfollowed for nearly 100 miles, from the northern end of the Breidden\r\nHills in Montgomeryshire, by Shelve, Builth, Llanwrtyd and Llangadock,\r\nto the mouth of the Taf river. But some 35 miles further west another\r\ngroup of lavas and tuffs appears on the coast of Pembrokeshire,\r\nfrom Abereiddy Bay to beyond Fishguard. The want of continuity in\r\nthese scattered outcrops is no doubt partly due to concealment by\r\ngeological structure. But from the comparative thinness of the volcanic\r\naccumulations and their apparent thinning out along the strike it may\r\nbe inferred that no large Llandeilo volcano existed in Wales. There\r\nwould rather seem to have been a long line of minor vents which in\r\nthe south-east part of the area appear to have only discharged ashes.\r\nCertainly, if we may judge from their visible relics, these eruptions\r\nnever rivalled the magnitude of the discharges from the Arenig\r\nvolcanoes that preceded, or the Bala volcanoes that followed them.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. THE VOLCANO OF BUILTH AND ITS NEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\nSo far as the available evidence goes, the most important volcanic\r\ncentre down the eastern side of Wales during the Llandeilo period\r\nwas one which lay not far from the centre of the long line of vents\r\njust referred to. Its visible remains form an isolated tract of\r\nhilly ground, some seven miles long, and four or five miles broad,\r\nimmediately north from the town of Builth. This area is almost entirely\r\nsurrounded by unconformable Upper Silurian strata, so that its total\r\nextent is not seen, and may be much more considerable than the area now\r\nlaid bare by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rocks of Builth were first described in the \"Silurian\r\nSystem.\" Murchison clearly recognized that they included some which\r\nwere \"evolved from volcanic apertures during the submarine accumulation\r\nof the Lower Silurian rocks,\" and also \"unbedded volcanic masses\r\nwhich had been intruded subsequently, dismembering and altering all\r\nthe strata with which they came in contact.\"[177] These igneous rocks\r\nwere mapped in some detail by the Geological Survey, and their general\r\nrelations were expressed in lines of horizontal section.[178] They were\r\nlikewise described by Ramsay in the _Catalogue of the Rock-specimens\r\nin the Jermyn Street Museum_, specimens of them being displayed in\r\nthat collection.[179] The tuffs and lavas were distinguished, and\r\nlikewise the intrusive \"greenstones.\" But no attempt was made towards\r\npetrographical detail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _Silurian System_, 1839, p. 330. The occurrence of\r\n\"trappean ash\" with fossils in the Builth district was noticed by De la\r\nBeche, _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. i. (1846), p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: See Sheet 56 of the one-inch map and Sheets 5 and 6 of\r\nthe Horizontal Sections.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: _Catalogue of Rock Specimens_, 3rd edit. 1862, p. 36 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nThis interesting district has recently been studied by Mr. Henry\r\nWoods,[180] who has grouped the igneous rocks in probable order of\r\nappearance, as follows:--1st, Andesites; 2nd, Andesitic ash; 3rd,\r\nRhyolites; 4th, Diabase-porphyrite; and 5th, Diabase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. (1894), p. 566.]\r\n\r\nSome of the andesites are described as intrusive in the Llandeilo\r\nstrata. The ash in its lower part contains numerous well-rounded\r\npebbles of andesite, usually five or six inches in diameter, but\r\nsometimes having a length of two feet. It contains fossils (_Orthis\r\ncalligramma_, _Leptæna sericea_, _Serpulites dispar_, etc.), and as\r\nit is overlain with shales containing _Ogygia Buchii_, it may be\r\nregarded as probably of Lower Llandeilo age. The rhyolites are feebly\r\nrepresented, and some of them may possibly be intrusive. Among them a\r\nnodular variety has been noticed, the nodules being solid throughout,\r\nvarying up to two inches in diameter, and formed of microcrystalline\r\nquartz and felspar, with no trace of any radial or concentric internal\r\narrangement. The diabase-porphyrite, the most conspicuous rock of the\r\ndistrict, is intrusive in the andesites and ashes, and occurs in four\r\nseparate masses or sills. The diabases are all intrusive and of later\r\ndate than any of the other igneous rocks, and as they traverse also\r\nthe Llandeilo shales, they are probably considerably later than the\r\nprevious eruptions. But as they do not enter the surrounding Llandovery\r\nand Wenlock strata, they are regarded by Mr. Woods as of intermediate\r\nage between the time of the Llandeilo and that of the Upper Silurian\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nAbout nine miles in a west-south-westerly direction from the southern\r\nextremity of the Builth volcanic area, another much smaller exposure of\r\nigneous rocks has been mapped by the Geological Survey at the village\r\nof Llanwrtyd. This tract is only about three miles long and half a mile\r\nbroad. The volcanic rocks are represented as consisting of three or\r\nmore bands of \"felspathic trap\" interstratified in the Lower Silurian\r\nstrata, and folded into an anticline along the ridge of Caer Cwm. No\r\npublished line of section runs across this ground, and the band of\r\nrock does not appear to have been described.[181]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: The locality is referred to by De la Beche, _Mem. Geol.\r\nSurv._ vol. i. p. 31, and by Ramsay in the _Descriptive Catalogue of\r\nRock-specimens in the Museum of Practical Geology_, 3rd edit. p. 38,\r\nbut no specimens from it are in the collection.]\r\n\r\nSeventeen miles to the south-west a still feebler display of\r\nintercalated volcanic material occurs in the Llandeilo formation near\r\nthe village of Llangadock. The Geological Survey map represents one\r\nor more bands of ash associated with limestone, and thrown into a\r\nsuccession of folds. In the _Horizontal Section_ (Sheet III. Section\r\n3) a band, 100 to 200 feet thick, of \"trappean ash\" with fossils is\r\nshown among the shales, limestones and grits, and in the _Catalogue\r\nof Rock-specimens_ the same rock is referred to as brecciated ash in\r\nconnection with specimens of it in the Museum, which are described\r\nas not purely ashy, but containing many slate-fragments and broken\r\nfelspar-crystals together with organic remains.[182]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: _Op. cit._ p. 38.]\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-four miles still further in the same south-westerly\r\ndirection, two patches of \"ash\" are shown upon the Survey map, near the\r\nmouth of the river Taf. No description of these rocks is given.[183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: One of the patches was shown by J. Phillips in\r\n_Horizontal Section_, Sheet III. Section 6, as a \"felspathic trap,\"\r\nnear which the shales are bleached. The map, however, was subsequently\r\naltered, so as to make the igneous rocks pyroclastic.]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. THE VOLCANOES OF PEMBROKESHIRE\r\n\r\nIn north-western Pembrokeshire, the observations of Murchison, De\r\nla Beche and Ramsay showed the existence of an important volcanic\r\ndistrict, where numerous igneous bands are interstratified among the\r\nLower Silurian rocks, over an area extending from St. David's Head\r\nfor thirty miles to the eastward.[184] On the maps of the Geological\r\nSurvey, lavas, tuffs, sills and bosses were discriminated, but no\r\ndescription of these rocks was published. Since the publication of the\r\nSurvey map very little has yet been added to our information on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: See _Silurian System_, p. 401; Sheet 40 of the\r\nGeological Survey Map; _Memoir of A. C. Ramsay_, p. 232 _et seq._; De\r\nla Beche, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd series, vol. ii. part i. (1826), p.\r\n3.]\r\n\r\nThere appear to have been at least three principal groups of vents.\r\nOne may be indicated by the bands of \"felspathic trap\" which have been\r\nmapped as extending from near St. Lawrence for fourteen miles to the\r\neast. Another must have existed in the neighbourhood of Fishguard. A\r\nthird is shown to have lain between Abereiddy Bay and Mathry, by the\r\nabundant bands of lava and tuff and intrusive sills there to be seen.\r\n\r\nOf these areas the only one which has yet been examined and described\r\nin some detail is that of Fishguard, of which an account has recently\r\nbeen published by Mr. Cowper Reed.[185] This observer has shown that\r\nthe eruptions began there during the deposition of the Lower Llandeilo\r\nrocks, and continued intermittently into the Bala period. The earliest\r\nconsisted of felsites and tuffs intercalated between Lower Llandeilo\r\nblack slates containing _Didymograptus Murchisoni_, the tuffs\r\nthemselves being sometimes fossiliferous. A second great volcanic belt,\r\ncomposed of felsitic lavas, breccias and tuffs, lies at the base of the\r\nUpper Llandeilo strata and shows the maximum of volcanic energy. The\r\nbreccias are partly coarse agglomerates, which probably represent, or\r\nlie not far from, some of the eruptive vents of the time. A higher band\r\nof lavas and breccias appears to be referable to the Bala formation.\r\nThe whole volcanic series is stated to thin out towards the south-west,\r\nso that the chief focus of eruption probably lay somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood of Fishguard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. li. (1895), p. 149.]\r\n\r\nThe lavas may all be included under the general term felsite. Their\r\nspecific gravity ranges from 2·60 to 2·76, and their silica percentage\r\nfrom 68 to 72. Mr. Cowper Reed observed among them three conspicuous\r\ntypes of structure. Some are characterized by a distinct arrangement in\r\nfine light and dark bands which rapidly alternate, and are sometimes\r\nthrown into folds and convolutions. A second structure, observed only\r\nat one locality, consists in the development of pale grey or whitish\r\novate nodules, about half an inch in length, with a clear quartz-grain\r\nin their centre, or else hollow. The third type is shown by the\r\nappearance of perlitic structure on the weathered surface.[186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: Mr. Cowper Reed enters into a detailed account of the\r\nmicroscopic structures and chemical composition of these rocks. They\r\nhave rather a high percentage of alumina, potash and soda, and are\r\nobviously akin to the keratophyres of other districts.]\r\n\r\nThe tuffs and breccias are chiefly developed at the base and top of\r\neach volcanic group. Some of them contain highly vesicular fragments,\r\nas well as pieces of slate and broken crystals of quartz and felspar.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of this volcanic district is the occurrence\r\nin it of sills and irregularly-intruded masses of \"greenstone.\" Under\r\nthat name are comprised basalts, dolerites, andesitic dolerites with\r\ntachylitic modifications, as well as diabases and gabbros.[187] Some of\r\nthese rocks exhibit a variolitic structure. As regards age, some of the\r\nintrusions appear to have taken place before the tilting, cleavage and\r\nfaulting of the strata. They have not been noticed in the surrounding\r\nUpper Silurian strata, and we may perhaps infer that here, as at\r\nBuilth, they are of Lower Silurian date. Mr. Cowper Reed, however, is\r\ninclined to regard the large Strumble Head masses as later than the\r\ntilting and folding of the rocks.[188]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Mr. Cowper Reed, _op. cit._ p. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: _Op. cit._ p. 193.]\r\n\r\nA few miles to the south-west of the Fishguard district, on the coast\r\nof Abereiddy Bay, good sections have been laid bare of the volcanic\r\nrocks of this region. Dr. Hicks has shown that the bands of tuff\r\nthere displayed are intercalated among the black slates of the Lower\r\nLlandeilo group, and that there was probably a renewal of volcanic\r\nactivity during the deposition of the upper group.[189] But the\r\nvolcanic history of this area still remains to be properly investigated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxxi. (1875), p. 177.]\r\n\r\nIn southern Pembrokeshire two conspicuous bands of eruptive rocks\r\nhave long been known and described. Their general characters and\r\ndistribution were sketched by De la Beche,[190] and further details\r\nwere afterwards added by Murchison.[191] As traced by the officers\r\nof the Geological Survey, they were represented as consisting of\r\n\"greenstone,\" \"syenite\" and \"granite.\" The more northerly band was\r\nshown to run in a nearly east and west line from Lawrenny to the Stack\r\nRock, west of Talbenny, a distance of about fourteen miles. The second\r\nband, placed a short way farther south, stretches in the same general\r\nline, from Milford Haven at Dall Road into Skomer Island, a distance of\r\nabout seven miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: _Trans. Geol. Soc._, 2nd ser. vol. ii. (1823), p. 6 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: _Silurian System_, p. 401 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe relations of these rocks to the surrounding formations and their\r\ngeological age have been variously interpreted. De la Beche regarded\r\nthe different masses as intrusive, and probably later than even the\r\nadjoining Coal-measures.[192] Murchison, on the other hand, considered\r\nthe bedded eruptive rocks of Skomer Island to be undoubtedly lavas\r\ncontemporaneous with the strata among which they are intercalated.[193]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. i. p. 231.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: _Silurian System_, p. 404.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks have been studied petrographically by various observers. Mr.\r\nRutley gave a full description of the remarkable nodular and banded\r\nfelsites of Skomer Island.[194] Mr. Teall has also noticed these rocks,\r\nlikewise \"a magnificent series of basic lava-flows\" in the same island,\r\nand a number of \"porphyrites.\" The basic lavas seemed to him to contain\r\ntoo much felspar and too little olivine to be regarded as perfectly\r\ntypical olivine-basalts, and he found them to lie sometimes in very\r\nthin and highly vesicular sheets. The \"porphyrites\" he placed \"on the\r\nborder-line between basic and intermediate rocks.\"[195]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: \"The Felsitic Lavas of England and Wales,\" _Mem. Geol.\r\nSurvey_ (1885), pp. 16, 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _British Petrography_, pp. 224, 284, 336.]\r\n\r\nMore recently this southern district of Pembrokeshire has been examined\r\nby Messrs. F. T. Howard and E. W. Small, who have obtained further\r\nevidence of the interbedded character of the igneous series. Below\r\nan upper basalt they have noted the occurrence of bands of felsitic\r\nconglomerate, sandstone, shale and breccia lying upon and obviously\r\nderived from a banded spherulitic felsite, below which comes a lower\r\ngroup of basalts. The age of this interesting alteration of basic and\r\nacid eruptions has not been precisely determined, but is conjectured to\r\nbe that of the Bala or Llandovery rocks.[196]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1893, p. 766; _Geol. Mag._ 1896, p.\r\n481.]\r\n\r\n\r\niii. THE CAERNARVONSHIRE VOLCANOES OF THE BALA PERIOD\r\n\r\nOwing to the effects partly of plication and partly of denudation, the\r\nrocks of the next volcanic episode in Wales, that of the Bala period,\r\noccupy a less compact and defined area than those of the Arenig group\r\nin Merionethshire. From the latter they are separated, as we have seen,\r\nby a considerable depth of strata,[197] whence we may infer, with\r\nthe Geological Survey, that the eruptions of Arenig, the Arans and\r\nCader Idris were succeeded by a long period of repose, the Llandeilo\r\noutbreaks described in the foregoing pages not having extended\r\napparently into North Wales. When the next outbreaks took place, the\r\nvents are found to have shifted northwards into Caernarvonshire, where\r\nthey fixed themselves along a line not much to the east of where the\r\nCambrian porphyries and tuffs now appear at the surface. The lavas and\r\nashes that were thrown out from these vents form the highest and most\r\npicturesque mountains of North Wales, culminating in the noble cone\r\nof Snowdon. They stretch northwards to Diganwy, beyond Conway, and\r\nsouthwards, at least as far as the neighbourhood of Criccieth. They die\r\nout north-eastwards beyond Bala Lake, and there can be but little doubt\r\nthat they thin out also eastwards under the Upper Bala rocks. The lavas\r\nand tuffs that rise up on a similar horizon among the Bala rocks of the\r\nBerwyn Hills evidently came not from the Snowdonian vents, but from\r\nanother minor volcanic centre some miles to the east, while still more\r\nremote lay the vents of the Breidden Hills and the sheets of andesitic\r\ntuff that probably spread from them over the ground east of Chirbury\r\n(Map II.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: Estimated at from 6000 to 7000 feet, _Mem. Geol. Surv._\r\nvol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 131.]\r\n\r\nThe Caernarvonshire volcanic group extends from north to south for\r\nfully thirty miles, with an extreme breadth of about fifteen miles;\r\nwhile, if we include the rocks of the Lleyn peninsula, the area will be\r\nprolonged some twenty miles farther to the south-west.\r\n\r\nThe general stratigraphical horizon of this volcanic group has been\r\nwell determined by the careful mapping of Ramsay, Selwyn and Jukes on\r\nthe maps of the Geological Survey. These observers brought forward\r\nample evidence to show that the lavas and tuffs were erupted during\r\nthe deposition of the Bala strata of the Lower Silurian series, that\r\nthe Bala Limestone is in places full of ashy material, and that this\r\nwell-marked fossiliferous band passes laterally into stratified\r\nvolcanic tuffs containing the same species of fossils.[198] But the\r\nprogress of stratigraphical geology, and the increasing value found\r\nto attach to organic remains as marking even minor stratigraphical\r\nhorizons, give us reason to believe that a renewed and still more\r\ndetailed study of the Bala rocks of North Wales would probably furnish\r\ndata for more precisely defining the platforms of successive eruptions,\r\nand would thus fill in the details of the broad sketch which Sir\r\nAndrew Ramsay and his associates so admirably traced. Besides the\r\nBala Limestone there may be other lithological horizons which, like\r\nthe Garth grit and the pisolitic iron-ore of the Arenig group, might\r\nbe capable of being followed among the cwms and crests as well as the\r\nopener valleys of Caernarvonshire. Until some such detailed mapping is\r\naccomplished, we cannot safely advance much beyond the point where the\r\nstratigraphy was left by the Survey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. pp. 126, 128,\r\n131, 139, etc.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Survey maps and sections it is not difficult to follow the\r\ngeneral volcanic succession, and to perceive that the erupted materials\r\nmust altogether be several thousand feet in thickness from the lowest\r\nlavas in the north to the highest on the crest of Snowdon. In that\r\nmountain the total mass of volcanic material is set down as 3100 feet.\r\nBut this includes only the higher part of the whole volcanic group.\r\nBelow it come the lavas of Y Glyder-Fach, which, according to the\r\nSurvey measurements, are about 1500 feet thick, while still lower\r\nlie the ancient _coulées_ of Carnedd Dafydd and those that run north\r\nfrom the vent of Y-foel-frâs, which must reach a united thickness of\r\nmany hundred feet. We can thus hardly put the total depth of volcanic\r\nmaterial at a maximum of less than 6000 to 8000 feet. The pile is, of\r\ncourse, thickest round the vents of discharge, so that no measurement,\r\nhowever carefully made at one locality, would be found to hold good for\r\nmore than a short distance.\r\n\r\nThough little is said in the Survey Memoir of the vents from which this\r\nvast amount of volcanic material was erupted, the probable positions\r\nof a number of these orifices may be inferred from the maps. From\r\nthe shore west of Conway a series of remarkable eminences may be\r\ntraced south-westwards for a distance of nearly forty miles into the\r\npeninsula of Lleyn. At the northern extremity of this line stands the\r\nprominent boss of Penmaen-mawr, while southward beyond the large mass\r\nof Y-foel-frâs, with the smaller knobs west of Nant Francon, and the\r\ngreat dome of Mynydd-mawr, the eye ranges as far as the striking group\r\nof _puy_-like cones that rise from the sea around Yr Eifl and Nevin.\r\nSome of these hills, particularly Y-foel-frâs, were recognized by the\r\nSurvey as vents.[199] But the first connected account of them and of\r\ntheir probable relation to the volcanic district in which they occur\r\nhas been given by Mr. Harker in his exceedingly able essay on \"The\r\nBala Volcanic Series of Caernarvonshire,\"[200]--the most important\r\ncontribution to the volcanic history of Wales which has been made since\r\nthe publications of the Geological Survey appeared. I shall refer to\r\nthese vents more specially in the sequel. I allude to them here for the\r\npurpose of showing at the outset the marvellous completeness of the\r\nvolcanic records of Caernarvonshire. So great has been the denudation\r\nof the region that the pile of lavas and tuffs which accumulated\r\nimmediately around and above these orifices has been swept away. No\r\ntrace of any portion of that pile has survived to the west of the\r\nline of bosses; while to the east, owing to curvature and subsequent\r\ndenudation, the rocks have been dissected from top to bottom, until\r\nalmost every phase of the volcanic activity is revealed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Op. cit._ pp. 137, 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: This was the Sedgwick Prize Essay for 1888, and was\r\npublished in 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic products discharged from these vents consist of a\r\nsuccession of lava-streams separated by bands of slate, tuff,\r\nconglomerate and breccia. These fragmental intercalations, which vary\r\nfrom a few yards to many hundred feet in thickness, are important not\r\nonly as marking pauses in the emission of lava or in the activity of\r\nthe volcanoes, but as affording a means of tracing the several lavas to\r\ntheir respective vents. Essentially, however, the volcanic materials\r\nconsist of lava-flows, the intercalations of fragmentary materials,\r\nthough numerous, being comparatively thin. The thickest accumulation\r\nof tuffs is that forming much of the upper part of Snowdon. It is set\r\ndown by my predecessor at 1200 feet in thickness, but I should be\r\ninclined to reduce this estimate. I shall have occasion to show that\r\nthe summit and upper shoulders of Snowdon are capped with andesites\r\ninterstratified among the tuffs. Sir Andrew Ramsay has referred with\r\njustice to the difficulty of always discriminating in the field between\r\nthe fine tuffs and some of the lavas.[201] Yet I am compelled to admit\r\nthat, if the ground were to be re-mapped now, the area represented\r\nas covered by fragmental rocks would be considerably restricted. Mr.\r\nHarker is undoubtedly correct when he remarks that, taken \"as a whole,\r\nthe Bala volcanic series of Caernarvonshire is rather remarkable for\r\nthe paucity of genuine ashes and agglomerates.\"[202]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: _Op. cit._ p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Bala Volcanic Rocks_, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe lavas of the Bala volcanic group, like those of the Arenig series,\r\nwere mapped by the Survey as \"porphyries,\" \"felstones,\" or \"felspathic\r\ntraps.\" They were shown to be acid-lavas, having often a well-developed\r\nflow-structure comparable with that of obsidian and pitchstone, and to\r\nconsist of successive sheets that were poured out over the sea-floor.\r\nTheir petrography has subsequently been studied more in detail by many\r\nobservers, among whom I need only cite Professor Bonney, Professor\r\nCole, Mr. Rutley, Mr. Teall, and Miss Raisin; the most important recent\r\nadditions to our knowledge of this subject having been made by Mr.\r\nHarker in the Essay to which I have just referred.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of these lavas are thoroughly acid rocks, and\r\npresent close analogies of composition and structure to modern\r\nrhyolites, though I prefer to retain for them the old name of\r\n\"felsites.\" Their silica-percentage ranges from 75 to more than 80.\r\nTo the naked eye they are externally pale greyish, or even white, but\r\nwhen broken into below the thick decomposed and decoloured crust, they\r\nare bluish-grey to dark iron-grey, or even black. They break with a\r\nsplintery or almost conchoidal fracture, and show on a fresh surface\r\nan exceedingly fine-grained, tolerably uniform texture, with minute\r\nscattered felspars.\r\n\r\nOne of their most striking features is the frequency and remarkable\r\ndevelopment of their flow-structure. Not merely as a microscopic\r\ncharacter, but on such a scale as to be visible at a little distance on\r\nthe face of a cliff or crag, this structure may be followed for some\r\nway along the crops of particular flows. The darker and lighter bands\r\nof devitrification, with their lenticular forms, rude parallelism and\r\ntwisted curvature, have been compared to the structure of mica-schist\r\nand gneiss. One aspect of this structure, however, appears to have\r\nescaped observation, or, at least, has attracted less notice than it\r\nseems to me to deserve. In many cases it is not difficult to detect,\r\nfrom the manner in which the lenticles and strips of the flow-structure\r\nhave been curled over and pushed onward, what was the direction in\r\nwhich the lava was moving while still a viscous mass. By making a\r\nsufficient number of observations of this direction, it might in some\r\nplaces be possible to ascertain the quarter from which the several\r\nflows proceeded. As an illustration, I would refer to one of the\r\nbasement-felsites of Snowdon, which forms a line of picturesque crags\r\non the slope facing Llanberis. The layers of variously-devitrified\r\nmatter curl and fold over each other, and have been rolled into balls,\r\nor have been broken up and enclosed one within the other (Fig. 55).\r\nThe general push indicated by them points to a movement from the\r\nwestward. Turning round from the crags, and looking towards the west,\r\nwe see before us on the other side of the deep vale of Llyn Cwellyn,\r\nat a distance of little more than three miles, the great dome-shaped\r\nMynydd-mawr, which, there is every reason to believe, marks one of the\r\norifices of eruption. It might in this way be practicable to obtain\r\ninformation regarding even some of the vents that still lie deeply\r\nburied under volcanic or sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nThat these felsites were poured forth in a glassy condition may be\r\ninferred from the occurrence of the minute perlitic and spherulitic\r\nforms so characteristic of the devitrification of once vitreous rocks.\r\nMr. Rutley was the first who called attention to this interesting\r\nproof of the close resemblance between Palæozoic felsites and modern\r\nobsidians, and other observers have since confirmed and extended his\r\nobservations.[203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxv. (1879), p. 508.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Flow-structure in the lowest felsite on the\r\ntrack from Llanberis to the top of Snowdon. Length about 4 feet, height\r\n2½ feet.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable aspect of the felsites is that nodular structure so\r\noften to be seen among them, and regarding the origin of which so much\r\nhas already been written. I agree with Professor Cole and Mr. Harker\r\nin looking upon the \"nodules\" as derived from original spherulites by\r\na process of alteration, of which almost every successive stage may be\r\ntraced until the original substance of the rock has been converted into\r\na flinty or agate-like material. If this be the true explanation of the\r\nstructure, some of the original lavas must have exhibited perlitic and\r\nspherulitic forms on a gigantic scale. There can, I think, be little\r\ndoubt that this peculiar structure was very generally misunderstood\r\nby the earlier observers, who naturally looked upon it as of clastic\r\norigin, and who therefore believed that large beds of rock consisted\r\nof volcanic conglomerate, which we should now map as nodular felsite\r\n(pyromeride).[204]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Another source of error may probably be traced in\r\nthe occasional brecciated structure of the felsites, which has\r\nbeen mistaken for true volcanic breccia, but which can be traced\r\ndisappearing into the solid rock. Sometimes this structure has resulted\r\nfrom the breaking up of the lenticles of flow, sometimes from later\r\ncrushing.]\r\n\r\nWhile by far the larger proportion of the Caernarvonshire lavas\r\nconsists of thoroughly acid rocks, the oldest outflows are much less\r\nacid than those erupted at the height of the volcanic activity, when\r\nthe rocks of Snowdon were poured forth.[205] But towards the close\r\nof the period there was apparently a falling off in the acidity of\r\nthe magma, for at the top of the group the andesitic lavas to which\r\nI have already alluded are encountered. Sir Andrew Ramsay has shown\r\nthe existence of an upper \"felstone\" or \"felspathic porphyry,\" almost\r\nentirely removed by denudation, but of which outliers occur on\r\nCrib-goch, Lliwedd, and other crests around Snowdon, and likewise on\r\nMoel Hebog.[206] Mr. Harker alludes to these remnants, and speaks of\r\nthem as less acid than the older lavas, but he gives no details as to\r\ntheir structure and composition.[207] In an examination of Snowdon\r\nI was surprised to find that the summit of the mountain, instead of\r\nconsisting of bedded ashes as hitherto represented, is formed of a\r\ngroup of lava-sheets having a total thickness of perhaps from 100 to\r\n150 feet (6 in Fig. 56). The apex of Yr Wyddfa, the peak of Snowdon,\r\nconsists of fossiliferous shale lying on a dull grey rock that weathers\r\nwith elongated vesicles, somewhat like a cleaved amygdaloid, but a\r\ngood deal decomposed. A thin slice of this latter rock shows under the\r\nmicroscope irregular grains and microlites of felspar, with a few grams\r\nof quartz, the whole much sheared and calcified. Below this bed comes\r\na felsite, or devitrified obsidian, showing in places good spherulitic\r\nstructure, and followed by a grey amygdaloid. The latter is a markedly\r\ncellular rock, and, though rather decayed, shows under the microscope a\r\nmicrolitic felspathic groundmass, through which granules of magnetite\r\nare dispersed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Mr. Harker, _op. cit._ p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. pp. 141, 144,\r\n145, 147, 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: _Bala Volcanic Series_, pp. 10, 23, 125. He refers also\r\nto lavas occupying a similar position at Nant Gwynant and Moel Hebog;\r\nbut he adds that he had not had an opportunity of studying them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Section of Snowdon.[208]\r\n\r\n1. Grits and slates; 2. Felsite with good flow-structure; 3. Volcanic\r\ntuffs; 4. Felsite; 5. Tuffs with sheets of felsite and andesite;\r\n6. Group of andesitic lavas on summit of Snowdon; 7. Intrusive\r\n\"greenstones.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: After the Geological Survey Section (Horizont. Sect.\r\nSheet 28), slightly modified.]\r\n\r\nUnderneath this upper group of lavas lie the tuffs for which Snowdon\r\nhas been so long celebrated. But, as I have already stated, there\r\ndoes not appear to me to be such a continuous thickness of fragmental\r\nmaterial as has been supposed. There cannot, I think, be any doubt that\r\nnot only at the top, but at many horizons throughout this supposed\r\nthick accumulation of tuff, some of the beds of rock are really\r\nlava-flows. Some of these lavas have suffered considerably from the\r\ncleavage which has affected the whole of the rocks of the mountain,\r\nwhile the results of centuries of atmospheric disintegration, so active\r\nin that high exposed locality, have still further contributed to alter\r\nthem. They consequently present on their weathered faces a resemblance\r\nto the pyroclastic rocks among which they lie. Where, however, the\r\nlavas are thicker and more massive, and have resisted cleavage better,\r\nsome of them appear as cellular dull grey andesites or trachytes, while\r\na few are felsites. Many instructive sections of such bands among the\r\ntrue tuffs may be seen on the eastern precipices of Snowdon above\r\nGlas-lyn.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the latest lavas which flowed from the Snowdonian\r\nvent were, on the whole, decidedly more basic than the main body of\r\nfelsites that immediately preceded them. They occur also in thinner\r\nsheets, and are far more abundantly accompanied with ashes. At the\r\nsame time it is deserving of special notice that among these less\r\nacid outflows there are intercalated sheets of felsite, and that\r\nsome of these still retain the spherulitic structure formed by the\r\ndevitrification of an original volcanic glass.\r\n\r\nFar to the south-west, in the promontory of Lleyn, another group\r\nof volcanic rocks exists which may have been in a general sense\r\ncontemporaneous with those of the Snowdon region, but which were\r\ncertainly erupted from independent vents. Mr. Harker has described\r\nthem as quartzless pyroxene-andesites, sometimes markedly cellular,\r\nand though their geological relations are rather obscure, he regards\r\nthem as lava-flows interbedded among strata of Bala age and occurring\r\nbelow the chief rhyolites of the district. If this be their true\r\nposition, they indicate the outflow of much less highly siliceous lavas\r\nbefore the eruption of the acid felsites. In the Snowdon area any such\r\nintermediate rocks which may have been poured out before the time of\r\nthe felsitic outflows have been buried under these.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs of the Bala series in Caernarvonshire have not received the\r\nsame attention as the lavas. One of the first results of a more careful\r\nstudy of them will probably be a modification of the published maps by\r\na reduction of the area over which these rocks have been represented.\r\nThey range from coarse volcanic breccias to exceedingly fine compacted\r\nvolcanic dust, which cannot easily be distinguished, either in the\r\nfield or under the microscope, from the finer crushed forms of felsite.\r\nAmong the oldest tuffs pieces of dark blue shale as well as of felsite\r\nmay be recognized, pointing to the explosions by which the vents were\r\ndrilled through the older Silurian sediments already deposited and\r\nconsolidated. Sometimes, indeed, they recall the dark slate-tuffs of\r\nCader Idris, like which they are plentifully sprinkled with kaolinized\r\nfelspar crystals. The beds of volcanic breccia intercalated between\r\nthe lower felsites of Snowdon include magnificent examples of the\r\naccumulation of coarse volcanic detritus. The blocks of various\r\nfelsites in them are often a yard or more in diameter. Among the\r\nfelsite fragments smaller scattered pieces of andesitic rocks may\r\nbe found. This mixture of more basic materials appears to increase\r\nupwards, the highest ashes containing detritus of andesitic lavas like\r\nthose which occur among them as flows.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs in the upper part of Snowdon are well-bedded deposits made up\r\npartly of volcanic detritus and partly of ordinary muddy sediment.[209]\r\nLayers of blue shale or slate interstratified among them indicate\r\nthat the enfeebled volcanic activity marked by the fine tuffs passed\r\noccasionally into a state of quiescence. As is well known, numerous\r\nfossils characteristic of the Bala rocks occur in these tuffs. The\r\nvolcanic discharges are thus proved to have been submarine and to have\r\noccurred during Bala time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: See the interesting account of these tuffs given by Sir\r\nA. Ramsay, _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 142.]\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to some of the probable vents from which the\r\nlavas and tuffs were discharged, and to their position along a line\r\ndrawn from Penmaen-mawr into the peninsula of Lleyn. It will be\r\nobserved that they lie outside the area of the bedded volcanic rocks\r\nand rise through parts of the Silurian system older than these rocks.\r\nThe largest and most important of them is unquestionably that formed by\r\nY-foel-frâs and its neighbouring heights. As mapped by the Geological\r\nSurvey, this mass of igneous rock is irregularly elliptical, measures\r\nabout six square miles in area, and consists mainly of intrusive\r\n\"felstone-porphyry\" passing into \"hornblendic greenstone.\"[210] Mr.\r\nHarker, however, has made an important correction of this petrography,\r\nby showing that a large part of the area consists of augitic\r\ngranophyre, while the so-called \"greenstone\" is partly diabase and\r\npartly andesitic ashes and agglomerates. He suggests that an older vent\r\nhas here been destroyed by a later and larger protrusion of igneous\r\nmatter.[211] This high and somewhat inaccessible tract of ground is\r\nstill in need of detailed mapping and closer study, for undoubtedly\r\nit is the most important volcanic vent now visible in North Wales. My\r\nformer colleague in the Geological Survey, Mr. E. Greenly, spent a\r\nweek upon it some years ago, and kindly supplied me with the following\r\nnotes of his observations:--\"The central and largest area of the neck\r\nis mainly occupied with diabases and andesites, while the ashes and\r\nagglomerates, which are intimately connected with them, seem to run as\r\na belt or ring round them, and to occur in one or more patches in the\r\nmidst of them. Portions of green amygdaloid run through the pyroclastic\r\nmasses. Outside the ring of agglomerate and ashes an interrupted border\r\nof felsite can be traced, which may be presumed to be older than\r\nthey, for a block of it was observed in them. The granophyre, on the\r\nother hand, which is interposed between the fragmental masses and the\r\nsurrounding rocks on the western wall of the vent, seems to be of later\r\ndate. Dykes or small bosses of diabase, like the material of the sills,\r\npierce both the agglomerates and the rocks of the centre.\"[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: _Mem. Geol. Survey_, vol. iii. 2nd edit. pp. 137, 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: _Bala Volcanic Series_, pp. 41, 71, 72, 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Mr. Greenly has made a sketch map of this interesting\r\nlocality. As he has now established his home in North Wales, I trust he\r\nmay find an opportunity of returning to Y-foel-frâs and completing his\r\ninvestigations.]\r\n\r\nNo agglomerate appears to have been noticed by any observer among the\r\nother supposed vents along the line that runs south-westwards from\r\nPenmaen-mawr, to the promontory of Lleyn. These bosses are rudely\r\ncircular in ground-plan and rise vertically out of the Lower Silurian\r\nor Cambrian strata, or partake more of the nature of lenticular sheets\r\nor laccolites which have been thrust between the planes of bedding.\r\nThere is usually an observable alteration of the surrounding rocks\r\nalong the line of contact.\r\n\r\nThe material of these bosses is sometimes thoroughly acid, as is the\r\ngranophyre of Y-foel-frâs, the microgranite of Mynydd-mawr with its\r\nriebeckite crystals, the augite-granite-porphyry of Clynog-fawr, and\r\nthe granophyric and rhyolitic quartz-porphyries of the Rivals. In other\r\ncases the rock is of an intermediate grade, as in the enstatite-diorite\r\nof Penmaen-mawr, the pyroxene-andesite of Carn Boduan, and the\r\nquartz-augite-syenite of Llanfoglen.[213] A few bosses of still more\r\nbasic material occur in the Sarn district, including hornblende-diabase\r\nand hornblende-picrite. Sometimes both the acid and the more basic\r\nrocks are found in the same boss, as in the large mass of Y-foel-frâs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: The geological relations and petrographical characters\r\nof these various rocks are given by Mr. Harker in the fourth and fifth\r\nsections of his Essay.]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that there is no absolute proof that any of\r\nthese masses mark the actual sites of eruptive vents, except probably\r\nthe boss of Y-foel-frâs. Some of them may have been intruded without\r\nestablishing any outlet to the surface.[214] But that a few of them\r\nreally represent orifices from which the Bala volcanic group was\r\nerupted may be plausibly inferred from their neck-like form, from\r\ntheir positions with reference to the volcanic district, from the\r\nobvious thickening of the lavas and tuffs in the direction of these\r\nbosses, and from the petrographical relation that exists between their\r\ncomponent materials and rocks that were discharged at the surface. This\r\nlast-named feature has been well pointed out by Mr. Harker, who has\r\nestablished, by a study of microscopic slides, a gradation from the\r\ngranophyric material of the bosses into structures greatly resembling\r\nthose of the bedded felsites, and likewise a close similarity between\r\nthe intermediate rocks of the other bosses and the andesites which\r\nhave elsewhere been poured out at the surface.[215] But perhaps the\r\nmost impressive evidence as to the sites of the chief centres of\r\neruption is supplied by the lavas and tuffs themselves as they thicken\r\nin certain directions and thin away in others. This feature of their\r\ndistribution has been well expressed in the maps and sections of the\r\nSurvey, and has been clearly summarized by Mr. Harker.[216] The oldest\r\nlavas now visible lie at the northern end of the district, and the\r\nvents from which they proceeded may, with considerable probability, be\r\nplaced somewhere in the tract which includes the chain of bosses of\r\nPenmaen-mawr, Y-foel-frâs, and Y Drosgl. The chief centre of eruption\r\nno doubt lay somewhere in the Snowdon tract, where the lavas and\r\ntuffs attain their greatest thickness, and whence they thin away in\r\nall directions. The Mynydd-mawr boss may be presumed to have been one\r\nof the main vents. But there were not improbably others, now concealed\r\nunder the deep cover of their own ejections.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Mr. Harker speaks of some of them as laccolites.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: _Op. cit._ pp. 57, 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: See especially pp. 9, 120 _et seq._, and fig. 6 of his\r\nEssay.]\r\n\r\nMore diligent search, with a special eye to the discovery of such\r\nvents, might indeed be rewarded, even in the midst of the volcanic\r\ndistrict itself. To the north-east of Capel Curig, for example, there\r\nis a prominent knob of agglomerate,[217] which I visited with Mr. B.\r\nN. Peach, and which we regarded as probably marking one of the minor\r\nvents. The material of this eminence has a base which by itself would\r\nprobably be regarded by the field-geologist as a felsite. But through\r\nthis compact matrix are dispersed abundant stones of all sizes up to\r\nsix inches or more in diameter. They are mostly subangular or somewhat\r\nrounded-off at the edges, and generally markedly cellular. Among\r\nthem may be observed pieces of trachyte, felsite, and a rock that is\r\nprobably a devitrified pitchstone or obsidian. The vesicles in these\r\nstones are sometimes lined with an acicular zeolite. Traces of rude\r\nbedding can be detected, dipping at high angles. On the north-east side\r\nof the hill finer agglomerate is seen to alternate with ashy grits and\r\ngrey shales, which, dipping E.N.E. at 20°-30°, pass under a group of\r\nfelsites, one at least of which retains a very fine perlitic structure\r\nand evidently flowed as a true glass. Some of these lavas are full of\r\nenclosed pieces of various flinty cellular and porphyritic felsites and\r\nandesites or trachytes, like the stones which occur abundantly in the\r\nagglomerate. The connection of these bedded lavas and tuffs with the\r\nagglomerate-neck seems obvious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: This rock is referred to in the _Geological Survey\r\nMemoir_ as \"a short thick band of conglomeratic ash, which strikes\r\nnorthwards about half a mile and then disappears\" (p. 134).]\r\n\r\nThe Caernarvonshire volcanic area furnishes another admirable example\r\nof the intrusion of basic sills as a final phase of eruptivity. These\r\nmasses have been carefully separated out on the maps of the Geological\r\nSurvey, which present a striking picture of their distribution and\r\ntheir relation to the other igneous rocks. An examination of the maps\r\nshows at once that the basic sheets tend to lie parallel with the\r\nbedding along certain horizons. In the southern and western portions\r\nof the area they have forced themselves among the Lower Silurian\r\nsedimentary strata that underlie the Bala volcanic group--a position\r\nanalogous to that taken by the corresponding sills of the Arenig\r\nseries. But they likewise invade the volcanic group itself. Along the\r\neastern borders of the district they abound, especially in the higher\r\nparts of the volcanic pile, where they have been injected between the\r\nflows, and have subsequently participated in the abundant plication of\r\nthe rocks between the mountains and the line of the River Conway.\r\n\r\nThe curvatures into which the rocks of the region have been thrown,\r\nand the consequent breadth of country over which the volcanic sheets\r\ncan now be examined, furnish a much better field than Merionethshire\r\nfor the attempt to trace the probable centre or centres from which the\r\nbasic magma of the sills was protruded. A study of the Survey maps soon\r\nleads to a conviction that the intrusions were not connected, except\r\nperhaps to a trifling extent, with the great line of western vents.\r\nIt is remarkable that the older strata which emerge from under the\r\nvolcanic group on its western outcrop are, on the whole, singularly\r\nfree from sills, though some conspicuous examples are shown opposite to\r\nMynydd-mawr, while a few more occur further north along the same line.\r\nTheir lenticular forms, their short outcrops, and their appearance on\r\ndifferent horizons at widely separated points seem to indicate that the\r\nsills probably proceeded from many distinct subterranean pipes. Their\r\ngreater abundance along the eastern part of the district may be taken\r\nto indicate that the ducts lay for the most part considerably to the\r\neastward of the line of western vents. They may have risen in minor\r\nfunnels, like that of Capel Curig.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that so abundant an extravasation of basic material\r\nshould have taken place without the formation of numerous dykes.\r\nWe have here a repetition of the phenomena that distinguished the\r\npreceding Arenig volcanic period in Merionethshire, and it will be\r\nremembered that the Llandeilo eruptions of Builth were likewise\r\nfollowed by the injection of large bodies of basic rock. As an enormous\r\namount of igneous magma may thus be impelled into the Earth's crust\r\nwithout the formation of dykes, it is evident that the conditions for\r\nthe production of sills must be in some important respects different\r\nfrom those required for dykes.\r\n\r\nNo evidence has yet been obtained that any one of these sills\r\nestablished a connection with the surface. Not a trace can be found of\r\nthe outpouring of any such basic lava-streams, nor have fragments of\r\nsuch materials been met with in any of the tuffs. On the other hand,\r\nthere is abundant proof of the usual contact-metamorphism. Though the\r\nsills conform on the whole to the bedding, they frequently break across\r\nit. They swell into thick irregular masses, and thin out rapidly. In\r\nshort, they behave as true intrusive sheets, and not as bedded lavas.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their internal character, they show the customary\r\nuniformity of texture throughout each mass. They are mapped under\r\nthe general name of \"greenstones\" by the Geological Survey, and are\r\ndescribed in the _Memoir_ as hornblendic.[218] The more precise modern\r\nmethods of examination, however, prove them to be true diabases, in\r\nwhich the felspar has, as a rule, consolidated before the augite,\r\ngiving as a result the various types of diabasic structure.[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: _Op. cit._ p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Mr. Harker, _Bala Volcanic Series_, p. 83.]\r\n\r\nThe date of the intrusion of these basic sills can be fixed by the same\r\nprocess of reasoning as was applied to those of the Arenig volcanic\r\ngroup. Their connection with the other igneous rocks of Caernarvonshire\r\nis so obvious that they must be included as part of the volcanic\r\nhistory of the Bala period. But they clearly belong to a late stage,\r\nperhaps the very latest stage, of that history. They probably could not\r\nhave been injected into their present positions, unless a considerable\r\nmass of rocky material had overlain them. Some of them are certainly\r\nyounger than the tuffs of Snowdon and Moel Hebog, which belong to a\r\nlate part of the volcanic period. On the other hand, they had been\r\nintruded before the curvature and compression of the region, for\r\nthey share in the foldings and cleavage of the rocks among which they\r\nlie. The terrestrial movements that produced this disturbance have\r\nbeen proved to have occurred after the time when the uppermost Bala\r\nrocks were deposited, and before that of the accumulation of the Upper\r\nSilurian formations.[220] The epoch of intrusion is thus narrowed\r\ndown to some part of the Upper Bala period. With this subterranean\r\nmanifestation, volcanic action in this part of the country finally died\r\nout.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: _Mem. Geol. Sur._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 326. See also\r\nMr. Harker's _Bala Volcanic Series_, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n\r\niv. THE VOLCANIC CENTRE OF THE BERWYN HILLS\r\n\r\nAmong the thick group of sedimentary formations which overlies the\r\ngreat volcanic ridge of the Arans and Arenig, and undulates eastwards\r\nacross the Bala Valley, occasional thin intercalations of tuff point\r\nto the existence of another centre of volcanic activity which lay\r\nsomewhere in the region of the Berwyn Hills. The structure of this\r\nground, first indicated by Sedgwick, was investigated in detail by\r\nJ. B. Jukes and his colleagues, whose work was embodied in the Maps,\r\nSections and Memoirs of the Geological Survey.[221] The distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the volcanic rocks of this district are the\r\noccurrence of both lavas and tuffs as comparatively thin solitary bands\r\nin the midst of the ordinary sediments, and the persistence of these\r\nbands for a distance of sometimes more than 24 miles. The position of\r\nthe vent or vents from which this extensive outpouring of volcanic\r\nmaterial took place has not been revealed. As the bands tend to thin\r\naway eastwards, it may be surmised that the chief focus of eruption lay\r\nrather towards the west, perhaps under the trough of Upper Silurian\r\nstrata somewhere in the neighbourhood of Llandderfel. There was\r\nprobably another in the Hirnant district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: See Sheet 74 of the one-inch map; Sheets 32, 35, 37 and\r\n38 of the Horizontal Sections; and chapter xxxi. of the _Memoir_ on the\r\nGeology of North Wales.]\r\n\r\nThe mapping of the officers of the Survey showed that in the Berwyn\r\nHills there are representatives of both the great volcanic periods of\r\nNorth Wales. A lower series of \"felstones and greenstones\" probably\r\nbelongs to the older period, which began towards the end of Cambrian\r\ntime and lasted in some districts even into the time of the Llandeilo\r\nformation. An upper group of tuffs, lying among the Bala rocks, is\r\nevidently equivalent, on the whole, to the much thicker volcanic series\r\nof the Snowdon region.\r\n\r\nThe lowest visible volcanic rocks occur among the hills to the\r\nnorth-west of Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant. They are described as consisting\r\nof felstone of a pale greenish-grey colour and compact texture,\r\nlike those of Arenig, and ashes distinctly interstratified with the\r\nslates. No exact petrographical examination of these rocks has yet\r\nbeen made. From the account given in the Survey _Memoir_ there appears\r\nto be here a group of lavas and tuffs intercalated in Llandeilo\r\nperhaps partly in Upper Arenig, strata which form the broken dome\r\nof the Berwyn anticline. The lavas are represented as lying on four\r\nor five platforms, a single band reaching a thickness of 300 feet\r\nand separated from the next band by sometimes 1000 or 1500 feet of\r\nnon-volcanic sediment.\r\n\r\nThese lower lavas, according to the measurements of Jukes, are overlain\r\nby more than 4000 feet of sedimentary strata before the upper or Bala\r\nvolcanic series is reached. Three successive \"ash-beds\" constitute\r\nthis upper series. Of these the lowest band, about 50 or 60 feet\r\nthick, was named a \"greenstone ash\" in contradistinction to a felstone\r\nash, and was not traceable for more than a short distance. Above it,\r\nafter an intervening thickness of several hundred feet of sedimentary\r\nstrata, comes a second and much more continuous band of tuff, known\r\nas the \"Lower ash-bed,\" about 100 feet thick on the west front of the\r\nBerwyn range. Still higher, after an interval of about 1500 feet of\r\nslates, lies the \"Upper ash-bed,\" which on the same line of section\r\nhas a thickness of about 200 feet. This is the most persistent of all\r\nthe volcanic horizons, for it can be followed continuously round the\r\nwhole range of the Berwyns until it is overlain by the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone near Selattyn, a distance of not less than twenty-four miles.\r\nThe same band, but much more feebly developed, has been traced through\r\nthe faulted country on both sides of Bala Lake, where it formed a\r\nuseful platform in the investigation of the complicated geological\r\nstructure of that area. Along the north side of the Berwyn Hills\r\nanother thin band of tuff lies from 150 to 200 feet still higher up in\r\nthe series, and has been traced for a distance of about twelve miles.\r\nThe Bala limestone comes in about 800 or 1000 feet above the \"Upper\r\nash-bed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Section across the Berwyn Hills. (Reduced from\r\nHorizontal Section, Geol. Surv., Sheet 35).\r\n\r\n_L_, Llandeilo Flags; _B_, Bala group; _B L_, Bala Limestone; _t_ _t_,\r\nvolcanic tuffs; _D_, intrusive \"greenstones.\"]\r\n\r\nBesides the rocks now enumerated, the Survey maps show the\r\nintercalation of four or five sheets of \"greenstone,\" which are\r\nrepresented as following with marked regularity the strike of the\r\nstrata. Until these sheets have been more precisely examined it is\r\nimpossible to decide regarding their true petrographical character,\r\nor to determine whether they are sills, or interstratified lavas, or\r\ninclude rocks of both these types.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE VOLCANOES OF ANGLESEY\r\n\r\nWe now turn to another part of the country, about which much has been\r\nwritten and keen controversy has arisen. In the centre of Anglesey,\r\namong the rocks grouped together by the Geological Survey as \"altered\r\nCambrian,\" there occur masses of breccia, the probable volcanic\r\norigin of which was, so far as I know, first suggested by Professor\r\nHughes.[222] Dr. Callaway regards them as pre-Cambrian,[223] while\r\nProfessor Blake places them in his \"Monian system.\"[224] When I went\r\nover them some years ago, I accepted the view that they are volcanic\r\nagglomerates.[225] Subsequent examination, however, has convinced me\r\nthat notwithstanding their remarkable resemblance to true agglomerates\r\nthey are not really of volcanic origin, but are essentially\r\n\"crush-conglomerates,\" like those in the Isle of Man, so well described\r\nby Mr. Lamplugh.[226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._ vol. iii. (1880), p. 347.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: _Presidential Address Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvii. (1891), p.\r\n130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. li. (1895), p. 563. See\r\n_Geol. Mag._ 1896, p. 481.]\r\n\r\nBut though their present coarse, agglomerate-like structure is, I\r\nthink, entirely due to the mechanical crushing of the rocks _in situ_\r\nand not to volcanic explosions, it does not follow that the rocks\r\nwhich have been broken up do not contain evidence of volcanic action\r\ncontemporaneous with their original formation. Obviously, pyroclastic\r\nmaterials may be subjected to deformation and disruption as well as any\r\nother components of the earth's crust, and may be equally converted\r\ninto crush-conglomerates. And in Anglesey it can, I think, be shown\r\nthat some of the rocks which have been broken up were originally tuffs\r\nand volcanic breccias.\r\n\r\nThroughout Anglesey the stratified rocks present evidence of having\r\nundergone very great compression, deformation and rupture. Thus\r\nat Llanerchymedd thick-bedded Lower Silurian grits, with their\r\nintercalations of shale, have been broken up by numerous small faults,\r\nand have been pushed over each other in large irregular blocks, the\r\nshales being now pinched out, and now pressed up into the interstices\r\nbetween the dislocated harder and more resisting grits. This condition\r\nof rupture may be regarded as one of the stages towards the formation\r\nof a conglomerate by the crushing together of rocks _in situ_. A\r\nfew miles further south at the beginning of the railway cuttings of\r\nLlangefni, green, red and purple slates and grits appear in a rather\r\nmore crushed state, and immediately beyond these strata come the\r\ncoarse breccias. Neither in their composition nor in their structural\r\ncondition do these Llangefni strata appear to be marked off from the\r\nundoubted Lower Silurian rocks as parts of a different system.\r\n\r\nThe railway cuttings at Llangefni reveal a series of rocks which appear\r\nto have been originally shales, with thin bands of siliceous grit.\r\nThe argillaceous portions of this series are now green and phyllitic,\r\nand remind one of the finer parts of some basic tuffs among the older\r\nPalæozoic systems. They include, however, pale flinty bands, such as\r\nmight have been derived from fine felsitic dust. The grits are for the\r\nmost part fine-grained and highly siliceous, but they include also\r\ncoarser varieties with clear quartz-grains. The enormous deformation\r\nwhich these strata have undergone is at once apparent. They seem to\r\nhave been plicated, ruptured and thrust over each other, the harder\r\nparts surviving longest, but being eventually broken into small\r\nfragments. Every stage may be traced from a recognizable band of grit\r\ndown to the rounded or elliptical pebbles of the same material entirely\r\nisolated in this phyllitic matrix of crushed shale.\r\n\r\nBut while the volcanic origin of these coarsely-fragmental masses\r\ncannot be maintained, there is elsewhere evidence that the older\r\nPalæozoic rocks of Anglesey include relics of contemporaneous volcanic\r\neruptions. Seven miles to the south-east of Holyhead, in the basal\r\nLower Silurian conglomerates which, as before referred to, Mr. Selwyn\r\nfound lying unconformably on the green schists, there occur abundant\r\nfragments of volcanic rocks, besides the prevalent detritus of the\r\nschists of the neighbourhood. Some of the bands have somewhat the\r\ncharacter of volcanic breccias or tuffs, and they show an evident\r\nresemblance to portions of the Bangor group and the rocks of Llyn\r\nPadarn, though they are doubtless of much later age. That these\r\nvolcanic fragments were not derived from the waste of rocks of a much\r\nearlier period is made tolerably certain by the intercalation of true\r\ntuffs among the black shales higher up in the order of succession.\r\nHere, then, we have evidence of contemporaneous volcanic action in the\r\nvery basement Lower Silurian strata of Anglesey, which by their fossil\r\ncontents are shown to be on the horizon of the lowest Arenig or even\r\nTremadoc group.\r\n\r\nBut still further and fuller evidence of Silurian volcanism is to be\r\nobtained by an examination of the northern coast-line. I have already\r\nreferred to the elliptical fault which is marked on the Geological\r\nSurvey map as running from the north-western headland to the eastern\r\ncoast beyond Amlwch. The necessity for inserting this fault, apart\r\nfrom any actual visible trace of its occurrence, arose when the\r\nconclusion was arrived at that the rocks of the extreme north of\r\nAnglesey were essentially altered Cambrian strata.[227] For immediately\r\nto the south of these rocks black shales, obviously Silurian, were\r\nseen to dip to the north--a structure which could only be accounted\r\nfor by a dislocation letting them down into that position. The same\r\nnecessity for a fault has of course been felt by all writers who\r\nhave subsequently treated the northern area as pre-Cambrian. But it\r\nis deserving of notice that in the original mapping of the Survey no\r\ncontinuous abrupt hiatus is shown by the line which was afterwards\r\nmarked as a continuous line of fault. On the contrary, on one of\r\nthe field-maps in, I believe, Mr. Selwyn's handwriting the remark\r\noccurs:--\"The gradual passage from the black shale to the upper green\r\ngritty slates of Llanfechell is best seen at Bothedd, on road from\r\nLlanfaethlu to Llyn-llygeirian.\"[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: I have fully considered the evidence adduced by Dr.\r\nCallaway and Professor Blake, and have examined the ground, and can\r\ncome to no other conclusion than that stated in the text. But see Mr.\r\nBlake's remarks, _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: There is no continuous section now visible at this\r\nplace, but the two groups of rock can be traced to within a few feet of\r\neach other, both inclined as usual in the same direction, and the black\r\nshales appearing to pass under the others.]\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my aim to disprove the existence of faults along the\r\nline referred to. These may quite well exist; but there is assuredly\r\nno one gigantic displacement, such as the theory I am combating would\r\nrequire; while any faults which do occur cannot be greatly different\r\nfrom the others of the district, and do not prevent the true relations\r\nof the rocks from being discoverable.\r\n\r\nWhere the supposed elliptical fault reaches the shore at Carmel Point,\r\nthe two groups of rock seem to me to follow each other in unbroken\r\nsequence.[229] The black slates, which are admittedly Lower Silurian,\r\ndip underneath a breccia and greenish (Amlwch) slates. Not only so,\r\nbut bands of similar black slates occur higher up, interstratified\r\nwith and shading-off into tuffs and greenish slates. Further, bands\r\nof coarse volcanic breccia occur among the black slates south of the\r\nsupposed break. These, in accordance with the exigencies of theory,\r\nare represented as separated by a network of faults from the black\r\nslates amid which they lie. But good evidence may be found that they\r\nare truly interbedded in these slates. In short, the whole of the rocks\r\nin that part of Anglesey form one great series, consisting partly of\r\nblack slates, partly of greenish slates, with abundant intercalations\r\nof volcanic detritus. The age of the base of this series is moreover\r\ndetermined by the occurrence of Bala fossils in a band of limestone\r\nnear Carmel Point.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: I cannot admit that there is any evidence of a\r\nthrust-plane here. To insert one is merely to modify field-evidence to\r\nsuit theory. See _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 483.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks which extend eastward along the coast from the north-western\r\nheadland of Anglesey are marked on the Survey map as \"green, grey\r\nand purple slates with conglomeratic and siliceous beds.\" The truly\r\nvolcanic nature of a considerable proportion of these strata has been\r\nclearly stated by Mr. Blake.[230] As they dip in a general northerly\r\ndirection, higher portions of the series present themselves as far as\r\nthe most northern projection of the island near Porth Wen (Fig. 58).\r\nThey have been greatly crumpled and crushed, so that the slates pass\r\ninto phyllites. They include some thick seams of blue limestone and\r\nwhite quartzite, also courses of black shale containing Lower Silurian\r\ngraptolites. Among their uppermost strata several (probably Bala)\r\nfossils, including _Orthis Bailyana_, have been obtained by Professor\r\nHughes. It has been supposed that the higher bands of black shale may\r\nalso have been brought into their present positions by faults, and that\r\nthey do not really belong to the series of strata among which they lie.\r\nBut this suggestion is completely disproved by the coast-sections,\r\nwhich exhibit many thin interstratified leaves of black shale,\r\nsometimes less than an inch thick. These and the ashy layers containing\r\nthe _Orthis_ and other fossils form an integral part of the so-called\r\n\"Amlwch slates.\"[231]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xliv. (1888), p. 517.\r\nSee his further remarks in _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: The Amlwch slates exhibit on a great scale the puckering\r\nthat points to intense compression. This \"gnarled\" structure, as Prof.\r\nHughes called it, has been illustrated by Mr. Harker, _British Assoc.\r\nReport_ (1885), pp. 839, 840.]\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the regular intercalation of the black shales and tuffs\r\nin this sedimentary series, a portion of the coast section at Porth\r\nWen is here given (Fig. 58). The lowest member (1) of the series is\r\na white quartzite much jumbled in its bedding, but yet distinctly\r\ninterstratified with the other sediments, and containing intercalated\r\ncourses of green tuff and highly carbonaceous shale. Markings like\r\nworm-pipes are here and there to be seen. The next group of strata (2)\r\nconsists of black shale followed by yellow conglomeratic sandstone\r\nand pebbly tuffs. The shales enclose rounded and angular fragments\r\nof quartzite. The sandstone passes upward into pinkish and yellowish\r\nconglomerate (3), with an abundant lustrous phyllitic matrix, which\r\nwhen free from pebbles closely resembles some of the tuffs of Llyn\r\nPadarn. The next band (4) is one of yellow, sandy, felspathic grit,\r\nquartz-conglomerate and fine tuffs, with leaves of dark shale towards\r\nthe base. It was in the lower part of this band that the _Orthis_\r\nabove mentioned was found. The black shales contain markings which are\r\nprobably graptolites. Reddish quartzite and quartz-conglomerate (5)\r\nnext succeed. These strata have the same phyllitic base just noticed.\r\nThe highest group here shown is one of black, yellow and green shales\r\nmixed with patches and bands of volcanic breccia and tuff, the whole\r\nbeing greatly disturbed, cleavage and bedding seeming as it were to\r\nbe struggling for the mastery. These last strata look as if they were\r\nabout to pass up vertically into the ordinary dark Lower Silurian\r\nshales or slates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Section of the strata on the shore at Porth\r\nWen, west of Amlwch.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt regarding the serious amount of crushing which\r\nthe rocks of this coast-line have undergone. Some of the bands might\r\neven be described as \"crush-conglomerates.\" Yet the intercalation of\r\nseams of black shale and limestone, and the occurrence of the exactly\r\nsimilar but thicker group of black shales at Porth Prydd, which are\r\nadmitted to be Lower Silurian, unite the whole series of strata as\r\nparts of one formation.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the area coloured \"altered Cambrian\" on the Survey\r\nmap, and regarded as pre-Cambrian by some later observers, is proved by\r\nthe evidence of fossils at its base, towards its centre and at its top,\r\nto belong to the Lower Silurian series, probably to the Bala division.\r\nThat this was the geological horizon of part at least of the area\r\nwas recognized by Sir A. Ramsay, though he confessed himself unable\r\n\"precisely to determine on the north coast of Anglesey how much of the\r\nstrata are of Silurian and how much of Cambrian age.\"[232] Professor\r\nHughes was the first to suggest that the whole of these rocks should be\r\nreferred to the Bala group.[233]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. iii. 2nd edit. p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._ vol. iii. (1880), pp.\r\n341-348.] [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 59.--Section of intercalated black shale in the volcanic\r\n     series at Porth yr hwch, south of Carmel Point.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Green slates overlain with volcanic breccia,\r\nCarmel Point, Anglesey.]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on the determination of the true geological age of the\r\nrocks of the north of Anglesey because of the diversity of opinion\r\nrespecting them, and because of their great interest in regard to the\r\nhistory of volcanic action in Wales. These rocks contain a record of\r\nvolcanic eruptions, probably contemporaneous on the whole with those\r\nof the Bala period in Caernarvonshire, yet independent of them and\r\nbelonging to a different type of volcanic energy. Some of the vents\r\nprobably lay in the north-western part of Anglesey. The materials\r\nejected from them were, so far as we know, entirely of a fragmentary\r\nkind. Vast quantities of detritus, largely in the form of fine dust,\r\nwere thrown out; but no trace has yet been found of the outflow of\r\nany lava. The lower part of this volcanic series consists of bedded\r\nbreccias which are sometimes remarkably coarse. Their included stones,\r\nranging up to six inches or more in diameter, are usually more or\r\nless angular, and consist mainly of various felsites. Layers of more\r\nrounded pebbles occasionally occur, while the bedding is still further\r\nindicated by finer and coarser bands, and even by intercalations of\r\nfine tuffs and ashy shales. Towards their upper limits some of these\r\nvolcanic bands shade off into pale grey or greenish ashy shale,\r\nfollowed by black sandy shale of the usual kind. The relation of the\r\npeculiar greenish shale of the Amlwch type to these tuffs and breccias\r\nis well shown east of Carmel Point. This shale is interleaved with tuff\r\nand contains frequent repetitions of finer or coarser volcanic breccia,\r\nas well as occasional seams of black shale. An illustration of this\r\nstructure is given in Fig. 59, where some yellow decomposing breccias\r\n(1), cut by a fault (_f_), are overlain by about 40 or 50 feet of black\r\nshale (2), above which lies a flinty felsitic rock (3) that appears\r\nto run in bands or dykes through the agglomerate. At Carmel Point\r\n(Fig. 60) a similar structure may be observed to that at Llyn Padarn\r\nalready referred to (p. 163). The cleavage, which is well developed in\r\nthe green slates (_a_), is much more faintly marked in the overlying\r\nbreccia (_b_), but the bedding can still be detected in both rocks\r\nrunning parallel to their mutual boundary-line. Beyond Porth Padrig,\r\nwhich lies east from Carmel Point, the section may be seen which is\r\nshown in Fig. 61. Here the blue or lead-coloured shale or slate (_a_)\r\nmarked as Silurian on the Geological Survey map passes up into a mass\r\nof fine yellowish felsitic tuff and breccia (_b_). The shale at the\r\njunction intercalates in thin leaves with the tuff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Blue shale or slate passing into volcanic\r\nbreccia east of Porth Padrig, near Carmel Point, Anglesey.]\r\n\r\nThe breccias south of Carmel Point, though they are chiefly made up\r\nof felsitic detritus, sometimes show a preponderance of fragments\r\nof shale. They vary also rapidly in texture and composition. These\r\nvariations may indicate that the vent or vents from which their\r\nmaterials were derived stood somewhere in the near neighbourhood, if\r\nindeed they are not to be recognized in some of the boss-like eminences\r\nthat rise above the shore. At the same time, the enormous amount of\r\ncrushing and shearing which the rocks of this region have undergone\r\nhas doubtless introduced crush-conglomerates into the structure of the\r\nground. And some patient labour may be required before the nature and\r\norigin of the different fragmental masses are determined.\r\n\r\nCertain remarkably coarse, tumultuous breccias, exposed on the coast\r\nat Mynyddwylfa and Cemmaes, were formerly regarded by me as volcanic\r\nagglomerates. But more recent examination has satisfied me that these,\r\nlike the breccias at Llangefni, are not of volcanic origin but are\r\ncrush-conglomerates.[234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: Presidential Address, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlvii. p. 134; _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1896, Section C; _Geol. Mag._ 1896,\r\np. 481.]\r\n\r\nWhile the lower breccias are sometimes tolerably coarse, the volcanic\r\ndetritus becomes much finer in the higher parts of the Amlwch slates.\r\nAbove the limestones and black shales of Cemmaes volcanic breccias\r\nand ashes, with limestone, quartzite, conglomerate and thin seams of\r\nblack shale, continue to the extreme northern headlands. The amount\r\nof fine volcanic detritus distributed through these strata is very\r\ngreat. We can clearly make out that while ordinary sedimentation was\r\nin progress, an almost constant but variable discharge of fragmental\r\nmaterials took place from the vents in the neighbourhood. Sometimes\r\na special paroxysm of explosion would give rise to a distinct band\r\nof breccia or of tuff, but even where, during a time of comparative\r\nquiescence, the ordinary sand or mud predominated, it was generally\r\nmingled with more or less volcanic dust.\r\n\r\nSome bands of conglomerate in this group of strata deserve particular\r\nnotice. The most conspicuous of these, already referred to as seen at\r\nPorth Wen, is made up of quartz and quartzite blocks, embedded in a\r\nreddish matrix largely composed of ashy material, and recalling the red\r\nspotted tuffs of Llyn Padarn. The occurrence of strong conglomerates\r\nnear the top of a volcanic series has been noted at St. David's, Llyn\r\nPadarn and Bangor. In none of these localities, as I have tried to\r\nshow, do the conglomerates mark an unconformability or serious break\r\nbetween two widely-separated groups of rock. The Anglesey section\r\nentirely supports this view, for the conglomerates are there merely\r\nintercalations in a continuous sequence of deposits; they are succeeded\r\nby tuffs and shales like those which underlie them. The interposition\r\nof such coarse materials, however, may undoubtedly indicate local\r\ndisturbance, connected, perhaps, in this and the other localities, with\r\nterrestrial readjustments consequent upon the waning of volcanic energy.\r\n\r\nThe detailed geological structure of Anglesey is still far from being\r\ncompletely understood. Besides the serious crushing here referred to,\r\nthere is reason to suspect that considerable plication, perhaps even\r\ninversion, of the strata has taken place, and that, by denudation,\r\ndetached portions of some of the higher groups have been left in\r\ndifferent parts of the island. The occurrence of Upper Silurian\r\nfossils in several localities adds to the perplexity of the problem\r\nby indicating that, among the folds and hardly distinguishable from\r\nthe older slates, portions of Upper Silurian formations may have been\r\ncaught and preserved. These difficulties, moreover, involve in some\r\nobscurity the closing phases of volcanic activity in Wales; for until\r\nthey are, to some extent at least, removed, we shall be left in doubt\r\nwhether the vents in the north of Anglesey, which were in eruption\r\nprobably during Bala time, were the last of the long succession of\r\nWelsh volcanoes. If the black shales of Parys Mountain are really\r\nreferable to the horizon of the Mayhill Sandstone, the two great\r\nigneous bands between which they lie would seem to mark an outbreak\r\nof volcanic energy during Upper Silurian time. No other indications,\r\nhowever, of eruptions of that age having been met with in Great Britain\r\n(though they occur in the south-west of Ireland and possibly in\r\nGloucestershire), more careful investigation is required before such a\r\nposition can be safely assigned to any rocks in Anglesey.\r\n\r\nPutting these doubtful rocks aside for the present, we may, in\r\nconclusion, contrast the type of eruption in Anglesey with that of\r\nthe great Snowdonian region. While the Caernarvonshire volcanoes were\r\npouring forth their volumes of felsitic lava, and piling them up for\r\nthousands of feet on the sea-floor, the northern Anglesey vents, not\r\nmore than some five-and-twenty miles away, threw out only stones and\r\ndust, but continued their intermittent explosions until they had strewn\r\nthe sea-bottom with detritus to a depth of many hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another feature of interest in this independent group of\r\nsubmarine vents in Anglesey. Their operations appear to have begun\r\nbefore the earliest eruptions of the Bala volcanoes in Caernarvonshire.\r\nTheir first beginnings may, indeed, have been coeval with the\r\nexplosions that produced the older Arenig tuffs of Merionethshire;\r\ntheir latest discharges were possibly the last manifestations of\r\nvolcanic energy in Wales. They seem thus to bridge over the vast\r\ninterval from Tremadoc to Upper Bala, possibly even to Upper Silurian\r\ntime. But we may, perhaps, connect them with the still earlier period\r\nof Cambrian volcanism. I have referred to the evidence which appears\r\nto show that the vents whence the lavas and tuffs of Moel Trefan and\r\nLlyn Padarn were erupted gradually moved northwards, and continued\r\nin eruption until after the beginning of the deposition of the black\r\nslates that are generally regarded as Arenig. The Anglesey tuffs\r\nand breccias may thus be looked upon as evidence of a still further\r\nshifting of the active orifices northward. In this view, while the Aran\r\nand Cader Idris volcanoes broke out in Upper Cambrian and continued\r\nthrough Arenig time, and the Snowdonian group was confined to Bala\r\ntime, a line of vents opened to the north-west in the Cambrian period\r\nbefore the epoch of the Llanberis slates, and, dying out in the south,\r\ncontinued to manifest a minor degree of energy, frequently discharging\r\nfragmental materials, but no lava, over the sea-bottom, until, towards\r\nthe close of the Bala period, possibly even in Upper Silurian time,\r\nthey finally became extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. THE VOLCANOES OF THE LAKE DISTRICT (ARENIG TO CLOSE OF BALA PERIOD)\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the appearance of Sedgwick's classic letters to\r\nWordsworth, no volcanic area of Britain has probably been so well known\r\nin a general sense to the ordinary travelling public as the district\r\nof the English Lakes. Many geologists have since then visited the\r\nground, and not a few of them have published additions to our knowledge\r\nrespecting what is now known as the Borrowdale Volcanic Series. The\r\nmost elaborate and detailed account of any part of it is that given by\r\nthe late Mr. J. C. Ward in the _Geological Survey Memoirs_, wherein he\r\nembodied the results of his minute investigation and mapping of the\r\nnorthern portion of the district.[235] Notices of the petrography of\r\nsome of the more interesting rocks have subsequently been published by\r\nMr. Rutley, Professor Bonney, Mr. Harker, Mr. Marr, Mr. Hutchings and\r\nothers. But up to the present time no complete memoir on the volcanic\r\ngeology of the Lake District as a whole has appeared. The sheets\r\nof the Geological Survey map present a graphic view of the general\r\ndistribution of the rocks, but so rapid has the progress of certain\r\nbranches of geology been since these sheets were published, that the\r\nmap is even now susceptible of considerable improvement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Sheet 101 S. E. of the Geological Survey of England\r\nand Wales and Explanation illustrating the same; and papers by him\r\nin _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xxxi. xxxii. (1875-76). See also\r\nMessrs. Aveline and Hughes, _Mem. Geol. Survey_, Sheet 98 N.E. (Kendal,\r\nSedbergh, etc.).]\r\n\r\nIn estimating the area over which the volcanic rocks of the Lake\r\nDistrict are spread, geologists are apt to consider only the tract\r\nwhich lies to the south of Keswick and stretches southward to a line\r\ndrawn from the Duddon Sands to Shap. But it can easily be shown that\r\nthis area falls far short of the extent of that wherein the rocks can\r\nstill be traced, and yet further short of that over which the lavas\r\nand ashes originally spread. For, in the first place, the volcanic\r\ngroup can be followed round the eastern end of the mountain-group which\r\nculminates in Skiddaw, and along the northern base of these heights to\r\nCockermouth, though only a narrow fringe of it emerges from underneath\r\nthe Carboniferous series. It is thus manifest that the volcanic rocks\r\nonce stretched completely across Skiddaw and its neighbours, and that\r\nthey extend northwards below the Whitehaven Coal-field. But, in the\r\nnext place, far beyond these limits, volcanic rocks, which there can\r\nbe little doubt were originally continuous with those of the Lakes,\r\nemerge from beneath the base of the Cross Fell escarpment,[236] and\r\nstill further to the east a prolongation of the same group rises for\r\na brief space to the surface from under the great limestone sheets of\r\nUpper Teesdale. Between the north-western and south-eastern limits\r\nwithin which the rocks can now be seen there intervenes a distance of\r\nsome 11 miles, while the extreme length of the tract from south-west\r\nto north-east is about 50 miles. Even if we take these figures as\r\nmarking the approximate boundaries of the region covered by the\r\nvolcanic ejections, it cannot be less than 550 square miles. But this\r\nis probably much less than the original area.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: For an account of the Cross Fell inlier of Silurian\r\nrocks see the paper by Professor Nicholson and Mr. Marr, with the\r\npetrographical appendix by Mr. Harker. _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlvii. (1891), pp. 500, 512.]\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the accumulated volcanic materials is proportionate\r\nto the large tract of country over which they have been spread. From\r\nvarious causes, it is difficult to arrive satisfactorily at any precise\r\nstatement on this question. In a volcanic series bedding is apt to be\r\nobscure where, as in the present case, there are no interstratified\r\nbands of ordinary sedimentary strata to mark it off. It tends,\r\nmoreover, to vary considerably and rapidly within short distances, not\r\nonly from subsequent unequal movements of subsidence or elevation, but\r\nfrom the very conditions of original accumulation. Mr. Ward considered\r\nthat the maximum thickness of the volcanic group of the Lake District\r\nmight be taken to range from 12,000 to 15,000 feet.[237] Professors\r\nHarkness and Nicholson, on the other hand, gave the average thickness\r\nas not more than 5000 feet.[238] My own impression is that the truth is\r\nto be found somewhere between these two estimates, and that the maximum\r\nthickness probably does not exceed 8000 or 9000 feet. In any case\r\nthere cannot, I think, be much doubt that we have here the thickest\r\naccumulation of volcanic material, belonging to a single geological\r\nperiod, anywhere known to exist in Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Ward, _op. cit._ p. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: _Brit. Assoc. (1870) Sectional Reports_, p. 74.]\r\n\r\nThe geological age of this remarkable volcanic episode is fortunately\r\nfixed by definite palæontological horizons both below and above. The\r\nbase of the volcanic group rests upon and is interstratified with the\r\nupper part of the Skiddaw Slate,[239] which from the evidence of its\r\nfossils is paralleled with the Arenig rocks of Wales. The highest\r\nmembers of the group are interstratified with the Coniston Limestone,\r\nwhich, from its abundant fauna, can without hesitation be placed on\r\nthe same platform as the Bala Limestone of Wales, and is immediately\r\nfollowed by the Upper Silurian series. Thus the volcanic history\r\ncomprises the geological interval that elapsed between the later part\r\nof the Arenig period and the close of the Bala period. It begins\r\nprobably not so far back as that of the Arenig group of Merionethshire,\r\nand its termination was perhaps coincident with the dying out of the\r\nSnowdonian volcanoes. But it contains no record of a great break or\r\ninterval of quiescence like that which separated the Arenig from the\r\nBala eruptions in Wales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Mr. Dakyns has expressed his belief that the volcanic\r\ngroup lies unconformably on the Skiddaw Slate (_Geol. Mag._ 1869,\r\npp. 56, 116), and Professor Nicholson has formed the same opinion\r\n(_op. cit._ pp. 105, 167; _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ vol. iii. p. 106). Mr.\r\nGoodchild, however, has shown that in the Cross Fell inlier the oldest\r\ntuffs are interstratified with the Skiddaw Slates (_Proc. Geol. Assoc._\r\nvol. xi. (1889), p. 261). Mr. Ward in mapping the district inserted a\r\ncomplex series of faults along the junction-line between the volcanic\r\nseries and the Skiddaw Slates. When I went over the ground with him\r\nsome years before his death I discussed this boundary-line with him\r\nand could not adopt his view that it was so dislocated. More recent\r\nre-examination has confirmed me in my dissent. A large number of the\r\nfaults inserted on the Geological Survey map to separate the Skiddaw\r\nSlates from the Borrowdale volcanic series cannot be proved, and\r\nprobably do not exist. Others may be of the nature of \"thrust-planes.\"\r\nBut see Mr. Ward's explanation of his views, _op. cit._ p. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe materials that form this enormous volcanic pile consist entirely\r\nof lavas and ashes. No intercalations of ordinary sedimentary material\r\nhave been met with in it, save at the bottom and at the top. The lower\r\nlavas, well seen among the hills to the south of Keswick, were shown by\r\nMr. Ward to be intermediate between felsites and dolerites in regard\r\nto their silica percentage, and he proposed for them the name of\r\nfelsi-dolerites. They are comprised in the group of the andesites or\r\n\"porphyrites.\" From the analyses published by Mr. Ward, the amount of\r\nsilica appears to range up to about 60 per cent.[240] They are usually\r\nclose-grained, dull dark-grey to black rocks, breaking, where fresh,\r\nwith a splintery or conchoidal fracture, showing a few minute striated\r\nfelspars, apt to weather with a pale-brown or yellowish-grey crust,\r\nand sometimes strongly vesicular or amygdaloidal. They present many\r\nexternal resemblances to some of the \"porphyrites\" or altered andesites\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. A microscopic examination\r\nof specimens collected by Dr. Hatch and myself from the hills to the\r\nsouth of Keswick showed the rocks to be true andesites, composed of a\r\nmultitude of slender laths (sometimes large porphyritic crystals) of\r\nfelspar with a brownish glassy groundmass, and with some chloritic\r\nmaterial probably representing augite, but with no trace of quartz.[241]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxi. (1875) p.\r\n408, vol. xxxii. (1876) p. 24. Geology of Northern Part of Lake\r\nDistrict (_Mem. Geol. Survey_), p. 22. In a subsequent paper the more\r\nbasic lavas of Eycott Hill are compared with dolerites (_Monthly\r\nMicroscopical Journ._ 1877, p. 246).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: These rocks were mapped as tuffs by Mr. Ward. Their\r\nmicroscopic characters have been described by Messrs. Harker and Marr,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891), p. 292; by Mr. Harker, _op.\r\ncit._ p. 517; and by Mr. W. M. Hutchings, _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 537;\r\n1892, pp. 227, 540.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of andesite has been found by Mr. Hutchings to occur\r\nabundantly at Harter Fell, Mardale, between the Nan Bield Pass and\r\nHigh Street, and in the cliffs on the right side of the Kentmere\r\nValley. It consists of rocks mostly of a grey-green or grey-blue\r\ncolour with resinous lustre and extremely splintery fracture. They are\r\naugite-andesites of a much more vitreous nature than the dominant type\r\nof lavas of the Lake District. Their groundmass under the microscope is\r\nseen to have originally varied from a wholly glassy base to an intimate\r\nmixture of glass and exceedingly minute felspar-microlites. This\r\ngroundmass is permeated with chlorite in minute flakelets, and encloses\r\nnumerous porphyritic sharply-defined felspar-crystals, together with\r\nchlorite-pseudomorphs after augite.[242] Gradations from these rocks to\r\nthe ordinary more coarse-grained andesites may be observed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: Mr. Hutchings, _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 539. This observer\r\ndescribes a quartz-andesite or dacite from near Dunmail Raise.]\r\n\r\nSome of the andesites appear to have a trachytic facies, where the\r\nfelspars of the groundmass consist largely of untwinned laths and\r\nappear to be mainly orthoclase.[243]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: _Op. cit._ p. 543.]\r\n\r\nAmong the lavas of the Lake District there occur many which are\r\ndecidedly more basic than the andesites, and which should rather be\r\nclassed among the dolerites and basalts, though they do not appear to\r\ncontain olivine. These rocks occur at Eycott Hill, above Easedale Tarn,\r\nScarf Gap Pass, Dale Head, High Scawdell, Seatoller Fell and other\r\nplaces. Analyses of those from Eycott Hill were published by Mr. Ward,\r\nand their silica percentage was shown to range from 51 to 53·3.[244]\r\nThe microscopic characters of the group have been more recently\r\ndetermined by Mr. Hutchings[245] and Messrs. Harker and Marr.[246]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Monthly Microscopical Journal_, 1877, p. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: _Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 538.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893), p. 389.\r\nMr. Harker, _op. cit._ vol. xlvii. (1891).]\r\n\r\nThe andesitic and more basic lavas are particularly developed in\r\nthe lower and central part of the volcanic group. They rise into\r\nranges of craggy hills above the Skiddaw Slates, and form, with their\r\naccompanying tuffs, the most rugged and lofty ground in the Lake\r\nDistrict. They extend even to the southern margin of the volcanic\r\narea at one locality to the south-west of Coniston, where they\r\nmay be seen with their characteristic vesicular structure forming\r\na succession of distinct flows or beds, striking at the Coniston\r\nLimestone which lies upon them with a decided, though probably very\r\nlocal, unconformability.[247] One of the flows from this locality was\r\nfound by Dr. Hatch, under the microscope, to belong to the more basic\r\nseries. It approaches a basalt, containing porphyritic crystals of\r\nfresh augite instead of the usual felspars, and showing a groundmass\r\nof felspar microlites with some granules of augite and dispersed\r\nmagnetite. This local increase of basic composition is interesting as\r\noccurring towards the top of the volcanic group. A porphyritic and\r\nsomewhat vesicular andesite, with large crystals of striated felspar in\r\na dark almost isotropic groundmass, occurs under the Coniston Limestone\r\nnear Stockdale.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: This unconformability has been described and discussed\r\nby various observers. The general impression has been, I think, that\r\nthe break is only of local importance. Mr. Aveline, however, believed\r\nit to be much more serious, and he regarded the volcanic rocks which\r\nwere ejected during the deposition of the Coniston Limestone series as\r\nmuch later in date than those of the Borrowdale group. See _Mem. Geol.\r\nSurvey_, Explanation to Sheet 98 N.E. 2nd edit. p. 8 (1888).]\r\n\r\nMr. Ward was much impressed with the widespread metamorphism which\r\nhe believed all the volcanic rocks of this region had undergone,\r\nand as a consequence of which arose the difficulty he found in\r\ndiscriminating between close-grained lavas and fine tuffs. There is, of\r\ncourse, a general induration of the rocks, while cleavage has widely,\r\nand sometimes very seriously, affected them. There is also local\r\nmetamorphism round such bosses as the Shap granite, but the evidence of\r\nany general and serious metamorphism of the whole area does not seem to\r\nme to be convincing.[248]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: The metamorphism of all the rocks, aqueous and igneous,\r\naround the Shap granite has been well worked out by Messrs. Harker\r\nand Marr, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvii. (1891) p. 266, xlix.\r\n(1893) p. 359.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the original structure and subsequent alteration of\r\nsome of the andesitic lavas, an interesting section has recently\r\nbeen cut along the road up Borrowdale a little south of the Bowder\r\nStone. Several bands of coarse amygdaloidal lava may there be seen\r\ninterstratified among tuffs. The calcite amygdales in these rocks are\r\narranged parallel to the bedding and therefore in the planes of flow,\r\nwhile those lined with chlorite are more usually deformed parallel to\r\nthe direction of the cleavage. This difference suggests that before the\r\ncleavage took place, not improbably during the volcanic period, the\r\nrocks had been traversed by heated water producing internal alteration\r\nand rearrangements, in virtue of which the vesicles along certain\r\npaths of permeation were filled up with calcite, so as then to offer\r\nsome resistance to the cleavage, while those which remained empty, or\r\nwhich had been merely lined with infiltrated substance, were flattened\r\nand pulled out of shape. Messrs. Harker and Marr have shown that the\r\namygdaloidal kernels had already been introduced into the cellular\r\nlavas before the intrusion of the Shap granite. In the account to be\r\ngiven of the Tertiary plateau-basalts (Chapter xxxvi.) evidence will\r\nbe adduced that this filling up of the steam-cavities of lava may take\r\nplace during a volcanic period, and that it is probably connected with\r\nthe passage of heated vapours or water through the rocks.\r\n\r\nThough acid lavas are not wholly absent from the central and lower\r\nparts of the volcanic group, it is at the top that their chief\r\ndevelopment appears to occur. These rocks may be grouped together as\r\nfelsites or rhyolites. They probably play a much larger part in the\r\nstructure of the southern part of the volcanic area than the published\r\nmaps would suggest, and a detailed survey and petrographical study\r\nof them would well reward the needful labour.[249] A fine series of\r\nfelsites is interbedded in the lower part of the Coniston Limestone,\r\nand spreads out underneath it along the southern margin of the volcanic\r\ndistrict from the Shap granite south-westward for some miles[250] (Fig.\r\n62). Between the valleys of the Sprint and Kent these felsites (which\r\nfarther east are said to be 700 feet thick) may be seen interposed\r\nbetween the limestone and the fossiliferous calcareous shales below it,\r\nwhile from underneath the latter other sheets rise up into the range of\r\nhills behind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: See Mr. F. Rutley, \"The Felsitic Lavas of England and\r\nWales,\" _Mem. Geol. Surv._ 1885, pp. 12-15; also the description of\r\nMessrs. Harker and Marr, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891), p.\r\n301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: Unfortunately these acid lavas are not distinguished\r\nfrom the others in the Geological Survey maps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Section of felsites on the Coniston Limestone\r\ngroup, west of Stockdale.\r\n\r\n_a_, Felsites more or less cleaved; _b_, Calcareous shales with\r\nfossils, much cleaved; _c_, Cleaved felsite; _d_, Coniston Limestone;\r\n_e_, Stockdale Shales (with graptolites).]\r\n\r\nThese acid lavas are generally grey, cream-coloured, or pink, with a\r\nwhite weathered crust. Their texture when fresh is flinty or horny, or\r\nat least extremely fine-grained and compact. They are seldom markedly\r\nporphyritic. They frequently display good flow-structure, and sometimes\r\nsplit up readily along the planes of flow. Occasionally the flow-lines\r\non the outer crust have broken up in the movement of the rock, giving\r\nrise to irregular fragments which have been carried forward. Short,\r\nextremely irregular, branching veins of a fine cherty felsitic\r\nsubstance, which occasionally shows a well-marked flow-structure\r\nparallel to the walls, traverse certain parts of a dark-grey felsite,\r\nnear Brockstones, between the valleys of the Kent and Sprint.[251]\r\nOccasionally a distinct nodular structure may be observed in these acid\r\nlavas, sometimes minute, like an oolite, in other parts, as on Great\r\nYarlside, presenting large rounded balls. This nodular structure is not\r\nconfined to the lava-flows, but has been detected by Messrs. Harker\r\nand Marr in what appears to be an intrusive rock near Shap Wells. The\r\nmicroscopic characters of some of the Lake District rhyolites were\r\ndescribed by Mr. Rutley, who found them to exhibit beautiful perlitic\r\nand spherulitic structures.[252] That such rocks as these were poured\r\nout in a vitreous condition, like obsidian or pitchstone, cannot be\r\ndoubted. Chemical analysis shows that the Lake District rhyolites agree\r\nexactly with those of North Wales in their composition. They contain\r\nabout 76 per cent of silica.[253]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: Compare the structure described by Mr. Harker from the\r\nCross Fell inlier, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891), p. 518.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: \"Geology of Kendal,\" etc., _Mem. Geol. Survey_, Sheet 98\r\nN.E. 2nd edit. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: Messrs. Harker and Marr, _op. cit._ p. 302.]\r\n\r\nThe rhyolitic lavas have been seriously affected by the general\r\ncleavage of the region. In some places they have been so intensely\r\ncleaved as to become a kind of fissile slate, and there seems good\r\nreason to believe that in this altered condition they have often been\r\nmistaken for tuffs. Where they assume a nodular structure, the nodules\r\nhave sometimes been flattened and elongated in the direction of the\r\nprevalent cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe abundance and persistence of thoroughly acid lavas along the\r\nsouthern edge of the volcanic area where the youngest outflows are\r\nfound, is a fact of much interest and importance in the history of\r\nthe eruptions of this region. It harmonizes with the observations\r\nmade in Wales, where in the Arenig, and less distinctly in the Bala\r\ngroup, a marked increase in acidity is noticeable in the later volcanic\r\nproducts. At the same time, as above mentioned, there is evidence also\r\nof the discharge of more basic materials towards the close of the\r\neruptions, and even of the outflow of a lava approaching in character\r\nto basalt.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Geological Survey maps, by far the largest part of\r\nthe volcanic district consists of pyroclastic materials. When my\r\nlamented friend, the late Mr. Ward, was engaged in mapping the northern\r\npart of the district, which he did with so much enthusiasm, I had an\r\nopportunity of going over some of the ground with him, and of learning\r\nfrom him his ideas as to the nature and distribution of the rocks and\r\nthe general structure of the region. I remember the difficulty I had\r\nin recognizing as tuff much of what he had mapped as such, and I felt\r\nthat had I been myself required, without his experience of the ground,\r\nto map the rocks, I should probably have greatly enlarged the area\r\ncoloured as lava, with a corresponding reduction of that coloured as\r\ntuff. A recent visit to the district has revived these doubts. It is\r\nquite true, as Mr. Ward maintains, that where the finer-grained tuffs\r\nhave undergone some degree of induration or metamorphism, they can\r\nhardly, by any test in the field, be distinguished from compact lavas.\r\nHe was himself quite aware of the objections that might be made to his\r\nmapping,[254] but the conclusions he reached had been deduced only\r\nafter years of unremitting study in the field and with the microscope,\r\nand in the light of experience gained in other volcanic regions.\r\nNevertheless I think that he has somewhat exaggerated the amount of\r\nfragmental material in the northern part of the Lake District, and that\r\nthe mapping, so consistently and ably carried out by him, and followed\r\nby those members of the Survey who mapped the rest of the ground, led\r\nto similar over-representation there. Some portions of the so-called\r\ntuffs of the Keswick region are undoubtedly andesites; other parts in\r\nthe southern tracts include intercalated bands of felsite as well as\r\nandesite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: He says: \"I shall be very much surprised if my mapping\r\nof many parts of the district be not severely criticized and found\r\nfault with by those who examine only one small area and do not take\r\ninto consideration all the facts gathered together, during the course\r\nof several years, from every mountain flank and summit\" (_op. cit._ p.\r\n25). Mr. Hutchings has expressed his agreement with the opinions stated\r\nin the text. He likewise coincides in the belief that there are many of\r\nthese Lake District volcanic rocks, regarding which it is impossible to\r\ndecide whether they are lavas or ashes (_Geol. Mag._ 1891, p. 544).]\r\n\r\nBut even with this limitation, the pyroclastic material in the Lake\r\nDistrict is undoubtedly very great in amount. It varies in texture\r\nfrom coarse breccia or agglomerate, with blocks measuring several\r\nyards across, to the most impalpable compacted volcanic dust. In\r\nthe lower parts of the group some of the tuffs abound in blocks\r\nand chips of Skiddaw Slate. Some good examples of this kind may be\r\nseen in Borrowdale, below Falcon Crag and at the Quayfoot quarries.\r\nWhere the tuff is largely made up of fragments of dark blue slate,\r\nit much resembles the slate-tuffs of Cader Idris. Some of the pieces\r\nof slate are six or eight inches long and are now placed parallel to\r\nthe cleavage of the rock. Among the slate debris, however, felspar\r\ncrystals and felsitic fragments may be observed. Bands of coarser and\r\nfiner green tuff show very clearly the bedding in spite of the marked\r\ncleavage (Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Fine tuff with coarser bands near Quayfoot\r\nquarries, Borrowdale.\r\n\r\nThe highly-inclined fine lines show the cleavage. The more gently\r\ndipping bands and lines mark the bedding.]\r\n\r\nBut throughout the whole volcanic group the material of the tuff is\r\nchiefly of thoroughly volcanic origin, and its distribution appears to\r\nagree on the whole with that of the bedded lavas. In the older portions\r\nof the group it is probably mainly derived from andesitic rocks, though\r\nwith an occasional intermingling of felsitic or rhyolitic detritus,\r\nwhile in the higher parts many of the tuffs are markedly rhyolitic.\r\nAmong the lapilli minute crystals of felspar, broken or entire, may be\r\ndetected with the microscope. Some of the ejected ash must have been an\r\nexceedingly fine dust. Compacted layers of such material form bands of\r\ngreen slates, which may occasionally be seen to consist of alternations\r\nof coarser and finer detritus, now and then false-bedded. Such tuffs\r\nbring vividly before the mind the intermittent explosions, varying\r\na little in intensity, by which so much of the fabric of the Lake\r\nmountains was built up.\r\n\r\nBreccias of varying coarseness are likewise abundant, composed of\r\nfragments of andesite and older tuffs in the central and lower parts\r\nof the volcanic group, and mainly of felsitic or rhyolitic detritus\r\nin the upper parts. Some of these rocks, wherein the blocks measure\r\nseveral yards across, are probably not far from the eruptive vents,\r\nas at Sourmilk Gill and below Honister Pass. Generally the stones are\r\nangular, but occasionally more or less rounded. Stratification can\r\ngenerally be detected among these fragmental rocks, but it is apt to be\r\nconcealed or effaced by the cleavage, while it is further obscured by\r\nthat widespread induration on which Mr. Ward has laid so much stress.\r\nThe extreme state of comminution of the volcanic dust that went to form\r\nthe tuffs has probably caused them to be more liable to metamorphism\r\nthan the lavas.[255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: The microscopic and chemical characters of the\r\nAsh-Slates of the Lake District have been investigated by Mr.\r\nHutchings, _Geol. Mag._ 1892, pp. 155, 218.]\r\n\r\nLittle has yet been done in identifying any of the vents from which the\r\nvast mass of volcanic material in the Lake District was ejected. Mr.\r\nWard believed that the diabase boss forming the Castle Head of Keswick\r\nmarks the site of \"one of the main volcanic centres of this particular\r\ndistrict,\"[256] whence the great lava sheets to the southward flowed\r\nout. There are obviously two groups of bosses on the northern side of\r\nthe district, some of which may possibly mark the position of vents. A\r\nfew of them are occupied by more basic, others by more acid rocks. It\r\nis not necessary to suppose that the andesitic lavas ascended only from\r\nthe former and the felsites from the latter. While the felsites on the\r\nwhole are younger than the more basic lavas, they may have been erupted\r\nfrom vents which had previously emitted andesites, so that the present\r\nplug may represent only the later and more acid protrusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: _Op. cit._ p. 70.]\r\n\r\nBesides the boss of Castle Head there are numerous smaller basic\r\nintrusions farther down the Derwent Valley on either side of\r\nBassenthwaite Lake. Among these are the highly basic rocks forming\r\nthe picrite on the east side of the Dash Beck and the dykes on\r\nBassenthwaite Common. All these bosses, sills, and dykes rise through\r\nthe Skiddaw Slates, but there is no positive proof that they belong to\r\nthe Lower Silurian volcanic series; they may possibly be much later.\r\n\r\nThe most important and most interesting of all the intrusive masses\r\nof basic material is that which constitutes a large part of the\r\neminence that culminates in Carrock Fell. The remarkable variations\r\nin the composition of this mass have been already referred to. Mr.\r\nHarker has shown that while the centre of the mass is a quartz-gabbro,\r\nit becomes progressively more basic towards the margin. Through the\r\ngabbro a mass of granophyre has subsequently made its way, and along\r\nthe line of junction has incorporated into its own substance so much\r\nof the basic rock as to undergo a marked modification in its structure\r\nand composition. Whether these intruded bodies of basic and acid\r\nmaterial have ascended in one of the old volcanic funnels and have been\r\ninjected laterally in laccolitic fashion has not been ascertained. Mr.\r\nHarker, indeed, is rather inclined to refer the intrusions to a time\r\nnot only later than the Borrowdale volcanoes, but later even than the\r\nterrestrial movements that subsequently affected the district and gave\r\nthe rocks their present cleaved and faulted structures. Besides the\r\ngabbro and granophyre of this locality, igneous activity has manifested\r\nitself in the uprise of numerous later dykes and veins, intermediate\r\nto basic in composition. Some of these are glassy (tachylyte) and\r\nspherulitic or variolitic.[257]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: Mr. Harker, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. (1894) p.\r\n312, li. (1895) p. 125. _Geol. Mag._ 1894, p. 551.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Lake District a considerable number of bosses of more\r\nacid rocks rise through the Skiddaw Slates, and likewise through the\r\nvolcanic group even up to its highest members. Some of these bosses may\r\npossibly indicate the site of volcanic vents. Two of them, which form\r\nconspicuous features on either side of the Vale of St. John, consist of\r\nmicrogranite, and rise like great plugs through the Skiddaw Slates, as\r\nwell as through the base of the volcanic group. The view of the more\r\neastern hill, as seen from the west, is at once suggestive of a \"neck.\"\r\nThese masses measure roughly about a square mile each.\r\n\r\nWith the acid intrusions may possibly be associated some of the other\r\nmasses of granophyre, microgranite and granite (felsite, felstone,\r\nquartz-felsite, syenitic granite, quartz-syenite, elvanite), which\r\nhave long attracted attention in this region. The largest of these\r\nintrusions is the tract of granite which stretches from Eskdale down to\r\nnear the sea-coast as a belt about eleven miles long and from one to\r\nthree miles broad. Another large mass is the granophyre or \"syenite\" of\r\nEnnerdale. Numerous other intrusions of smaller dimensions have been\r\nmapped.\r\n\r\nTo what extent any of these eruptive masses were associated with the\r\nvolcanic phenomena remains still to be worked out. There seems to be\r\nlittle doubt that a number of them must belong to a much later period.\r\nMr. Harker has expressed his belief that the intrusion of some of\r\nthese igneous rocks was intimately associated with the post-Silurian\r\nterrestrial movements of which cleavage is one of the memorials.[258]\r\nThe Skiddaw granite, though it does not touch any part of the volcanic\r\ngroup, but is confined to the underlying Skiddaw Slates, was erupted\r\nafter the cleavage of the district, which affects the volcanic as\r\nwell as the sedimentary series. In other instances also, as in that\r\nof Carrock Fell, the intrusion seems to have been later than the\r\ndisturbances of the crust.[259] The amount of metamorphism around some\r\nof the bosses of granite is considerable. That of the Skiddaw region\r\nhas been well described by J. C. Ward,[260] while that of the volcanic\r\ngroup by the Shap granite has been carefully worked out by Mr. Harker\r\nand Mr. Marr.[261]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. li. (1895), p. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: _Op. cit._ p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: \"Geology of Northern Part of the English Lake District,\"\r\n_Mem. Geol. Surv._ 1876, chap. iii. The metamorphism around the\r\ndiorites and dolerites, and the granophyres and felsites, is described\r\nin the same chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891) p. 266, xlix.\r\n(1893) p. 359.]\r\n\r\nThe Shap granite comes through the very highest member of the volcanic\r\nseries, and even alters the Upper Silurian strata. It must thus be of\r\nmuch younger date than the volcanic history of the Lake District. It\r\npresents some features in common with the granite bosses of the south\r\nof Scotland. Like these, it is later than Upper Silurian and older than\r\nLower Carboniferous or Upper Old Red Sandstone time. Its protrusion may\r\nthus have been coeval with the great volcanic eruptions of the period\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone. It will accordingly be again referred\r\nto in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that none of the large bosses of massive rocks,\r\nwhether diabases, gabbros, felsites, granophyres, or granites, appear\r\nto afford any satisfactory proof of the position of the vents which\r\nsupplied the lavas and tuffs of the Lake District. Nor can such a\r\ndecided accumulation of the volcanic materials in certain directions\r\nbe established as to indicate the quarters where the centres of\r\neruption should be sought. On the contrary, the confused commingling\r\nof materials, and the comparative shortness of the outcrop of the\r\nseveral sheets which have been traced, rather suggest that if any one\r\ngreat central volcano existed, its site must lie outside of the present\r\nvolcanic district, or more probably, that many scattered vents threw\r\nout their lavas and ashes over no very wide area, but near enough to\r\neach other to allow their ejected materials to meet and mingle. The\r\nscene may have been rather of the type of the Phlegræan fields than\r\nof Etna and Vesuvius. If this surmise be true, we may expect yet to\r\nrecognize little necks scattered over the volcanic district and marking\r\nthe positions of some of these vanished cones.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to have been one of these small vents stands near Grange\r\nat the mouth of Borrowdale, where I came upon it in 1890. In the little\r\nComb Beck, the Skiddaw Slates are pierced by a mass of extremely coarse\r\nagglomerate, forming a rudely-circular boss. The slates are greatly\r\ndisturbed along the edges of the boss, so much so, indeed, that it is\r\nin some places difficult to draw a line between them and the material\r\nof the agglomerate. That material is made up of angular blocks, varying\r\nin size up to three feet long, stuck in every position and angle in an\r\nintensely-indurated matrix formed apparently of comminuted debris like\r\nthe stones. The blocks consist of a finely-stratified shale, which is\r\nnow hardened into a kind of hornstone, with some felsitic fragments. I\r\ncould see no slags or bombs of any kind. There is no trace of cleavage\r\namong the blocks, nor is the matrix itself sensibly cleaved. I believe\r\nthis to be a small volcanic neck and not a \"crush-conglomerate.\" It has\r\nbeen blown through the Skiddaw Slates, and is now filled up with the\r\ndebris of these slates. Its formation seems to have taken place before\r\nthe cleavage of the strata, and its firm position and great induration\r\nenabled it to resist the cleavage which has so powerfully affected the\r\nslates and many members of the volcanic group.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of my predecessor, Sir Andrew Ramsay, and likewise\r\nof Mr. Ward, that the Cumbrian volcanic action was mainly subærial.\r\nThis opinion was founded chiefly on the fact that, save at the bottom\r\nand top of the series, there is no evidence of any interstratified\r\nsediment of non-volcanic kind. The absence of such interstratification\r\nmay undoubtedly furnish a presumption in favour of this view, but,\r\nof course, it is by no means a proof. Better evidence is furnished\r\nby the unconformability already mentioned between the Coniston\r\nLimestone and the lavas on which it lies. Besides angular pieces of\r\nlava, probably derived from direct volcanic explosion, this limestone\r\ncontains fragments of amygdaloidal andesite, and also rolled crystals\r\nof striated felspar.[262] These ingredients seem to indicate that some\r\npart of the volcanic group was above water when the Coniston Limestone\r\nwas deposited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Messrs. Harker and Marr, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlvii. (1891), p. 310.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of interstratifications of ordinary non-volcanic sediment\r\nin the Borrowdale group might conceivably arise from the eruptions\r\nfollowing each other so continuously on the sea-floor, and at so\r\ngreat a distance from land that no deposition of sand or mud from the\r\noutside could sensibly affect the accumulation of volcanic material.\r\nCertainly some miles to the east at the Cross Fell inlier, as already\r\nmentioned, there is evidence of the alternation of tuffs with the sandy\r\nand muddy sediment of the sea-bottom. Here, at the outer confines of\r\nthe volcanic district, the ejected materials evidently fell on the\r\nsea-floor, mingled there with ordinary sediment, and enclosed the same\r\norganic remains. The well-defined stratification of many of the fine\r\ntuffs is rather suggestive to my mind of subaqueous than of subærial\r\naccumulation. At the same time, there seems no reason why, here and\r\nthere at least, the volcanic cones should not have risen above the\r\nwater, though their materials would be washed down and spread out by\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marked points of contrast between the Cumbrian and\r\nthe Welsh volcanic districts is to be found in the great paucity of\r\nsills in the former region. A few sheets of diorite and diabase have\r\nbeen mapped, especially in the lower parts of the volcanic group and\r\nin the underlying Skiddaw Slates. On the other hand, dykes are in some\r\nparts of the district not unfrequent, and certainly play a much more\r\nprominent part here than they do in the Welsh volcanic districts. The\r\nmajority of them consist of felsites, quartz-porphyries, diorites, and\r\nmica-traps. But there is reason to suspect that where they are crowded\r\ntogether near the granite, as around Shap Fells, they ought to be\r\nconnected with the uprise of the post-Silurian granitic magma rather\r\nthan with the history of the volcanic group.[263] If this series of\r\ndykes be eliminated, there remain comparatively few that can with any\r\nconfidence be associated with the eruption of the Borrowdale rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: For a description of the dykes around the Shap granite\r\nsee the paper by Messrs. Harker and Marr, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. xlvii. (1891), p. 285.]\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. UPPER SILURIAN (?) VOLCANOES OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE\r\n\r\nA remarkable group of igneous materials has long been known to rise\r\namong the Silurian rocks of the Tortworth district at the north\r\nend of the Bristol coal-field. They were believed to be aqueous\r\ndeposits in the Wernerian sense by Weaver.[264] Murchison regarded\r\nthem as intrusive sheets;[265] Phillips looked on them as partly\r\nintrusive and partly interstratified.[266] They consist largely of\r\ncoarsely-amygdaloidal basalts, some of which have been microscopically\r\nexamined.[267] But their field-relations as well as their petrography\r\nhave not yet been adequately determined. They are represented on the\r\nGeological Survey Map as forming a number of parallel bands in strata\r\nclassed as Upper Llandovery. If, as seems probable, some of them are\r\nreally interstratified, they form the youngest group of Silurian\r\nvolcanic rocks in England, Scotland, or Wales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd ser. vol. i. (1819), pp.\r\n324-334.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: _Silurian System_ (1839), p. 457.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. ii. part i. (1848), p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: \"Geology of East Somerset,\" etc., in _Mem. Geol. Surv._\r\n(1876), p. 210; descriptions by Mr. F. Rutley.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE SILURIAN VOLCANOES OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAbundant as are the volcanic records of the Silurian period in England,\r\nWales and Scotland, the description of them would be incomplete without\r\nan account of those of Ireland. The eruptions of Arenig, Llandeilo and\r\nBala time, which we have followed from the south of Caermarthenshire to\r\nthe borders of the Scottish Highlands, had their counterparts all down\r\nthe east of Ireland. The Irish register of them, however, supplies some\r\ndetails which are less clearly preserved in the sister island. But the\r\nmost distinctive feature of the Silurian volcanic history in Ireland is\r\nthe preservation of memorials of eruptions during the Upper Silurian\r\nperiod. In no part of Great Britain has any unquestionable trace been\r\nfound of volcanic activity during that part of the geological record,\r\nthe last eruptions of which the age is known being those of the Bala\r\nrocks. But in the south-west of Ireland there is evidence that for a\r\ntime active vents appeared over the sea-floor on which the earlier\r\ndeposits of Upper Silurian time were laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Lower Silurian Series\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Eruptions probably of Arenig Age_\r\n\r\nIt is in that part of Ireland which lies east of a line drawn from\r\nStrabane to Dungarvan Harbour that the records of Lower Silurian\r\nvolcanic activity are to be found. In the north the development of\r\nvolcanic rocks resembles that in Scotland, in the south it corresponds\r\nrather with the volcanic districts of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Silurian volcanic rocks have been traced with more or less\r\ndetail on the maps of the Geological Survey. Since these maps were\r\npublished, however, great advances have been made in the study of the\r\npetrography of volcanic rocks, as well as in the art of tracing their\r\nstructure upon maps. Much, therefore, now remains to be done to bring\r\nour knowledge of the older volcanic history of Ireland abreast of that\r\nof the rest of the British Isles. In the following summary I have had\r\nto rely mainly on my own traverses of the ground, guided by the maps\r\nand memoirs of the Survey, and with the personal assistance of some of\r\nmy colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable zone of crushed cherts, igneous rocks and sandstones,\r\nprobably of Lower Silurian age, which I have referred to (p. 201) as\r\nwedged in between the schists and the Old Red Sandstone along the\r\nsouthern margin of the Highlands of Scotland, reappears in Ireland.\r\nIt occupies an area in the County Tyrone, about 24 miles long and\r\nabout 9 miles broad at the broadest part, but disappearing towards the\r\nnorth-east and south-west.[268] Lying between the Palæozoic formations\r\non the south and the schists on the north, it occupies a similar\r\nposition to the Scottish belt, but presents a much broader area, and\r\nthus affords greater facilities for examining the rocks. It presents\r\nthe same indefinite or faulted boundaries as in Scotland, so that its\r\nrelations to the rocks along its flanks have not been satisfactorily\r\ndetermined. That the rocks of this area are older than the Silurian\r\nstrata to the south of them seems to be established by the occurrence\r\nof fragments of them in these strata, and that they are younger than\r\nthe schists may be inferred from their non-foliated character. But\r\nthey have undoubtedly undergone considerable crushing by powerful\r\nterrestrial movements which have placed them in their present position.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: This area was mapped by Mr. J. Nolan for the Geological\r\nSurvey, and was described by him in the _Geol. Mag._ for 1879. I\r\nvisited it in company with my colleagues, Mr. B. N. Peach and Mr. A.\r\nM'Henry, in 1890 and again in 1894. My first conclusion was that the\r\nvolcanic rocks should be regarded as part of the schistose series lying\r\nto the north of them (_Pres. Address Geol. Soc._ 1891, p. 77). But on\r\nthe second visit, after having studied the rocks of the border of the\r\nScottish Highlands, I formed the opinion stated in the text.]\r\n\r\nThe special feature of interest in this Irish area is the remarkable\r\ndevelopment of volcanic materials which is there to be seen, spreading\r\nover a far wider area than in Scotland. The rocks include lavas\r\nassociated with tuffs and agglomerates, likewise a varied series of\r\nintrusive masses.\r\n\r\nThe lavas are chiefly dull greenish, fine-grained rocks, having the\r\ngeneral character of diabases and \"porphyrites.\" They are sometimes\r\nquite slaggy, and where the amygdaloidal kernels remain, these are\r\nusually of calcite. Under the microscope, the diabases show in some\r\nparts that their lath-shaped felspars, and the augite which these\r\npenetrate, are tolerably fresh, while in other parts fibrous chlorite,\r\ngranular epidote and veins of calcite bear witness to the metamorphism\r\nwhich they have undergone.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous features in some of these lavas is the\r\noccurrence of the same sack-like or pillow-shaped structure which\r\nhas been already referred to as so marked among the Arenig lavas of\r\nScotland. Though the vesicles of these rocks are often quite uncrushed,\r\nshowing that there has been no general subsequent deformation of the\r\nwhole mass, there occur local tracts where evidence of considerable\r\nmovement may be noticed. Thus close to a mass of gneiss, and elsewhere\r\nalong their margin, the lavas are apt to be much jointed and broken\r\nwith numerous lines of shear, along which the crushed material assumes\r\nmore or less of a schistose structure. Yet in the solid cores between\r\nthese bands of crushing the original forms of the vesicles are retained.\r\n\r\nThese greenish lavas are occasionally interleaved with grey flinty\r\nmudstones, cherts and red jaspers, which are more particularly\r\ndeveloped immediately above. In lithological character, and in their\r\nrelation to the diabases, these siliceous bands bear the closest\r\nresemblance to those of Arenig age in Scotland. But no recognizable\r\nRadiolaria have yet been detected in them.\r\n\r\nBesides the more basic lavas, there occur also, but less abundantly,\r\nplaty felsitic rocks which have suffered much from shearing, and\r\nconsequently have acquired a fissile slaty structure.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerates are made up of angular, subangular and rounded\r\nfragments imbedded in a matrix of similar composition. This matrix\r\nhas in places become quite schistose, and then closely resembles\r\nsome parts of the \"green schists\" of the Scottish Highlands.\r\nOf the inclosed stones the great majority consist of various\r\nfelsites, which, weathering with a thick white opaque crust, are\r\ninternally close-grained, dull-grey or even black, sometimes showing\r\nflow-structure, and of all sizes up to eight inches in diameter or\r\nmore. There are also fragments of the basic lavas, and likewise pieces\r\nof chert and jasper. On many of the rocky hummocks no distinct bedding\r\ncan be made out in the agglomerate, but in others the rock is tolerably\r\nwell stratified.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs are fine silky schistose rocks, and seem to have been largely\r\nderived from basic lavas. They have suffered more than any of the other\r\nrocks from mechanical deformation, for they pass into green chloritic\r\nschists. Some portions of them are not unlike the slaty tuffs of Llyn\r\nPadarn in Caernarvonshire.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the fragmental volcanic rocks, some ordinary sedimentary\r\nintercalations are to be found--red shales and pebbly quartzites, that\r\nseem to have escaped much crushing. The true order of succession in the\r\nvolcanic series has not yet been determined. But apparently above this\r\nseries come some dark shales, such as might yield graptolites, pale\r\ngrits and occasional limestones.\r\n\r\nLater than the lavas and the pyroclastic material are various intrusive\r\nmasses, which in bands and bosses form numerous craggy hills throughout\r\nthe area. So far as I have been able to observe, these rocks include\r\ntwo groups. Of these the older consists of basic injections, such as\r\ngabbros and allied rocks, some of which remind me of the so-called\r\n\"hypersthene-rock\" of Lendalfoot, in Ayrshire. The coarser varieties,\r\nas at Carrickmore or Termon rock, are sometimes traversed by\r\nfine-grained veins from an inch to several feet in breadth. Portions\r\nof the slaggy diabases may be observed inclosed in these intrusive\r\nmasses. The younger group is of more acid composition (granite,\r\nquartz-porphyry, etc.), and sends veins into the older.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Eruptions of Llandeilo and Bala Age_\r\n\r\nInto the east of Ireland the Lower Silurian rocks are prolonged from\r\nScotland, from the Lake District and from Wales. Though greatly\r\nconcealed under younger formations across the breadth of the island,\r\nand occasionally interrupted by what are regarded as older strata of\r\nCambrian age, they nevertheless occupy by much the larger part of the\r\nmaritime counties from Belfast Lough to the southern coast-line of\r\nWaterford, even as far as Dungarvan Harbour. With the same lithological\r\ntypes of sedimentary deposits as in other parts of the United\r\nKingdom, they carry with them here also their characteristic records\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic action. Though nowhere piled into such\r\nmagnificent mountain-masses as in Westmoreland and North Wales, these\r\nrecords become increasingly abundant and interesting as they are traced\r\nsouthwards, until they are abruptly terminated by the coast-line along\r\nthe south of the counties of Wexford and Waterford.\r\n\r\nWhile much remains to be done, both in the field and in the laboratory\r\nand microscope-room, before our acquaintance with the Irish Silurian\r\nvolcanic rocks is as complete as our knowledge of their equivalents in\r\nother portions of the United Kingdom, a serious preliminary difficulty\r\nmust be recognized in the fact that the several geological horizons\r\nof these rocks have only been approximately fixed. Great difficulty\r\nwas experienced by the Geological Survey in drawing any satisfactory\r\nline between the Llandeilo and Bala formations. This arose not so\r\nmuch from deficiency of fossil evidence as from the way in which the\r\nfossils of each group seemed to occur in alternating bands in what were\r\nregarded as a continuous series of strata. Indeed, in some localities\r\nit almost appeared as if the occurrence of one or other _facies_ of\r\nfossils depended mainly on lithological characters indicative of\r\noriginal conditions of deposit, for the Llandeilo forms recurred\r\nwhere black shales set in, while Bala forms made their reappearance\r\nwhere calcareous and gritty strata predominated.[269] More recent\r\nwork among the Silurian formations in England and Scotland, however,\r\nindicates that the parallel repetition of the two types of fossils\r\nis due to rapid and constant plication of the rocks, whereby the two\r\nformations, neither of them, perhaps, of great thickness, have been\r\nfolded with each other in such a way that without the evidence of an\r\nestablished sequence of fossils, or the aid of continuous sections,\r\nit becomes extremely difficult to make out the stratigraphical order\r\nin any district. When the ground is attacked anew in detail, with\r\nthe assistance of such palæontological and lithological horizons as\r\nhave permitted the complicated structure of the southern uplands of\r\nScotland to be unravelled, we may be enabled to tabulate the successive\r\nphases of the volcanic history of the region in a way which is for\r\nthe present impossible. We have as yet no palæontological evidence\r\nthat in the Silurian region of the east of Ireland, which extends\r\nfrom Belfast Lough to the south coast of County Waterford, any of the\r\nanticlinal folds bring up to the surface a portion of the Lower Arenig\r\nformation, though possibly some of the lowest visible strata may be of\r\nUpper Arenig age. A considerable part of the region must be referred\r\nto the Llandovery and other Upper Silurian formations, but the precise\r\nlimits of the two divisions of the Silurian system have not yet been\r\ndetermined, except for the region north of Dublin, which has recently\r\nbeen re-examined for the Geological Survey by Mr. F. W. Egan and Mr. A.\r\nM'Henry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: Jukes was disposed to regard the two faunas as\r\nessentially coeval, but inhabiting different kinds of sea-bottom. See\r\nhis note, Explanation of Sheets 167, 168, 178, 179, p. 30.]\r\n\r\nThese observers have ascertained that, as in Southern Scotland, by far\r\nthe larger part of the Silurian region of the north-east of Ireland is\r\noccupied by strata belonging to the upper division of the system. The\r\nLower Silurian formations, including the Llandeilo and Bala groups,\r\nform a belt varying up to six miles in breadth, which stretches from\r\nthe coast of Down, between the mouth of Belfast Lough and Copeland\r\nIsland, in a south-westerly direction to near the valley of the Shannon\r\nin County Longford. South of this belt the Lower Silurian rocks\r\nrise to the surface only here and there on the crests of anticlinal\r\nfolds, and it is in these scattered \"inliers\" that the volcanic and\r\nintrusive rocks are found. So far as the available evidence goes, the\r\nvolcanic history of this part of Ireland is entirely to be assigned to\r\nLower Silurian time, and more especially to the interval between the\r\nbeginning of the Llandeilo and the close of the Bala period. I must\r\nfor the present content myself with this general limit of geological\r\nchronology, and make no attempt to trace the relative antiquity\r\nof the igneous rocks in the several districts in which they are\r\ndistributed.[270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: The task of revising the Irish maps and tracing out\r\nthe respective areas of Upper and Lower Silurian rocks over the whole\r\nisland is now in progress by the Geological Survey, Mr. Egan and Mr.\r\nM'Henry being entirely engaged on it.]\r\n\r\nViewing the volcanic region of Eastern Ireland as a whole, we are\r\nfirst struck by the feebleness of the manifestations of eruptivity in\r\nthe north, and their increasing development as we advance southwards.\r\nAt the northern end of the Silurian area in County Down, thin bands\r\nof \"felstone\" and \"ash\" have been mapped by the Geological Survey\r\nas interstratified with the highly inclined and plicated Silurian\r\nrocks.[271] As the latter are plainly a continuation of the strata\r\nwhich have been mapped out zone by zone in the south of Scotland, their\r\nigneous intercalations may be looked upon as probably equivalents\r\nof some of those in the Silurian districts of Wigtonshire and\r\nKirkcudbrightshire. But in County Down no representative has yet been\r\ndetected of the Arenig and Llandeilo volcanic series of the southern\r\nuplands of Scotland. Nor has more precise petrographical examination\r\nconfirmed the reference of any of the igneous rocks in the Silurian\r\narea of that district to truly contemporaneously intercalated volcanic\r\nrocks. All the eruptive material appears to be of an intrusive\r\ncharacter. It occurs in the form of dykes of lamprophyre or mica-trap\r\nbelonging to the groups of minettes and kersantites. Nothing definite\r\nis known of the age of these intrusions: they are possibly referable to\r\nthe time of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.[272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: See Sheet 49 Geol. Survey, Ireland, and Explanation\r\nthereto (1871), pp. 16, 37, 39. The so-called \"ashes\" of the\r\nExplanation are probably parts of dykes which have been more or less\r\ncrushed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: _Guide to the Collection of Rocks and Fossils belonging\r\nto the Geological Survey of Ireland_, by Messrs. M'Henry and Watts,\r\nDublin, 1895, p. 74.]\r\n\r\nFar in the interior several bands of \"felspathic ash\" and \"massive\r\nagglomerate\" are shown on the Survey map as running through the\r\ncounties of Monaghan and Cavan.[273] In one locality south of the\r\nDrumcalpin Loughs a large exposure of this ash is visible: \"brown\r\ncrumbly beds, with small rounded pebbles, give place to a massive bed\r\nof agglomerate, the enclosed blocks of which are always of one species\r\nof felstone, sometimes measuring 10 × 12 × 18 inches, and not always\r\nrounded.\" South of Carrickatee Lough, and a few miles farther to the\r\nsouth-west, near Lackan Bridge, considerable exposures of these rocks\r\noccur. One crag in particular displays a thickness of more than 70 feet\r\nof \"tough flaky breccias,\" \"thick agglomerates with small and large\r\nblocks of felstone,\" and \"thin beds of fine pale green compact grit\r\nwithout pebbles, and a few flags.\" \"One of the flaky beds contains\r\nnumerous white worn crystals of felspar\"; \"the imbedded blocks of\r\nfelstone are of the usual kind--pale compact matrix showing dark oblong\r\npatches, vesicular and amygdaloidal, the cavities being filled with\r\nchlorite.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: Sheet 69 Geol. Survey, Ireland, and Explanation of\r\nSheets 68 and 69, pp. 9, 13, 15.]\r\n\r\nFurther south a more extensive area of igneous rocks has been mapped\r\non the borders of Louth and Meath, where, according to the Geological\r\nSurvey map, a group of lavas and tuffs extends for about twelve miles\r\nnear Slane.[274] Other bands of \"ash\" and \"felstone\" have been mapped\r\nin the Silurian area south of Drogheda. Thus at Hilltown, west from the\r\nracecourse, a \"bluish crystalline felstone, showing in places lines\r\nof viscous flow,\" is stated to be overlain by \"indurated felspathic\r\nash and tuff, felstone, and indurated shale\" in alternating beds.[275]\r\nOn a recent visit to this locality I found that the \"porcellanite or\r\nindurated shale\" is a greenish-grey chert, full of Radiolaria and\r\nfinely-diffused volcanic dust. This association of radiolarian chert\r\nwith contemporaneous volcanic activity is of much interest, as showing\r\nthe extension of the same physical conditions of the Lower Silurian sea\r\nfrom Scotland into Ireland. The Lower Llandeilo age of the volcanic\r\nintercalations in County Meath is further indicated by the occurrence\r\nof _Didymograptus Murchisoni_ in grey shales in the same neighbourhood\r\nwith the radiolarian cherts. In the Lower Silurian district of\r\nBalbriggan numerous intrusive bosses and sills have been mapped by\r\nthe Geological Survey. I have found, however, that among these rocks\r\nthere occur bands of volcanic breccia, containing abundant angular\r\nfragments of a minutely-vesicular pumice, and also that some of the\r\ndiabase-masses display the pillow-structure and amygdaloidal texture.\r\nHence, though most of the igneous rocks are no doubt intrusive, they\r\nappear to include lavas and tuffs of Bala age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: _Ibid._ Sheets 81 and 91. These rocks are chiefly\r\naugitic andesites, a few are basalts, and some seem related to\r\nfelstones. Probably many of them are intrusive sills of uncertain\r\nage. The \"ashes\" contain fragments of felsite and porphyrite often of\r\nconsiderable size (_Guide to Irish Rock-Collection_, p. 36).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: _Ibid._ Sheets 91 and 92 and Explanation to these\r\nSheets (1871), p. 10; _Guide to Irish Rock-Collection_, p. 36. Some\r\nof these lavas are andesites, others are felsites. Mr. M'Henry has\r\ncontended that certain \"ashes\" and \"agglomerates,\" particularly\r\nthose exposed on the coast at Portraine, opposite Lambay Island, are\r\n\"crush-conglomerates\" due to terrestrial disturbances, which have\r\naffected both intrusive igneous rocks and the sedimentary series into\r\nwhich these have been injected.]\r\n\r\nWhen the numerous Silurian cores of the mountain-groups in the interior\r\nof Ireland shall have been searched for traces of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic action, it is not improbable that these will be found. One of\r\nthe smaller Silurian inliers which diversify the great Carboniferous\r\nplain, that of the Chair of Kildare, has long been known to have\r\nigneous rocks associated with its abundantly fossiliferous Bala\r\nlimestone.[276] On recently visiting this locality I found that,\r\nbesides the amygdaloidal and porphyritic andesites and basalts\r\ndescribed by Jukes and Du Noyer, the fossiliferous conglomerates\r\ncontain pebbles of rocks like those of the Chair, together with worn\r\ncrystals of felspar, while intercalated with them are thin courses of\r\nvolcanic tuff. There is thus evidence here of contemporaneous volcanic\r\nactivity during the accumulation of the Bala group of strata. The\r\nlimited area over which the rocks are exposed, however, affords merely\r\na glimpse of this volcanic centre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: See Explanation to Quarter Sheet 35 N.E. (Sheet 119 of\r\nnewer numeration) of Geol. Survey Ireland (1858), p. 16. (See note, p.\r\n256.)]\r\n\r\nCrossing over the broad belt of Carboniferous Limestone through which\r\nthe Liffey flows into Dublin Bay, we come to the great continuous\r\ntract of older Palæozoic rocks which stretches southward to the cliffs\r\nof Waterford. Through this tract runs the huge ridge of the Wicklow\r\nand Carlow granite. On the west side of this intrusive mass, bands\r\nof \"greenstone-ash,\" as well as \"felspathic ashes,\" have been traced\r\namong the Silurian rocks by the Geological Survey. But it is on the\r\nsouth-east side of the granite that the volcanic intercalations are\r\nbest displayed. Indeed, from Wicklow Head to Dungarvan Harbour there is\r\nan almost continuous development of igneous rocks, rising into rocky\r\neminences, trenched into ravines by the numerous streams, and laid bare\r\nby the waves in fine coast-cliffs. It is in this south-eastern region,\r\ncomprising the counties of Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford, that the\r\nIrish Lower Silurian igneous rocks can best be studied.\r\n\r\nThere are obviously various distinct centres of eruption in this long\r\nbelt of country. The Rathdrum and Castletimon tract forms one of these.\r\nAnother of less size culminates in Kilpatrick Hill, a few miles to\r\nthe southward. Arklow Head marks the position of a third. The lavas\r\nand tuffs which set in a few miles to the south of that promontory,\r\nand may be said to extend without interruption to the south coast,\r\nwere probably thrown out by a series of vents which, placed along a\r\nnorth-east and south-west line, united their ejections into one long\r\nsubmarine volcanic bank. There can be no doubt that the most active\r\nvents lay at the southern end of the belt, for there the volcanic\r\nmaterials are piled up in thickest mass, and succeed each other with\r\ncomparatively trifling intercalations of ordinary sedimentary material.\r\nSome of these vents, as I shall relate in the sequel, have been cut\r\nopen by the sea along a range of precipitous cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively feeble character of the volcanic energy during Lower\r\nSilurian time over the greater part of the south-east of Ireland is\r\nshown by the great contrast between the thickness of the volcanic\r\nintercalations there and in Wales and the Lake country, but still more\r\nstrikingly by innumerable sections where thin interstratifications of\r\nfine tuff or volcanic breccia occur among the ordinary sedimentary\r\nstrata, and are sometimes crowded with Bala fossils. Some interesting\r\nillustrations of this feature are to be seen in the Enniscorthy\r\ndistrict, where layers of fine felsitic tuff, sometimes less than\r\nan inch in thickness, lie among the shales. In some of the tuffs the\r\nlapilli are fragments of trachytic or andesitic rocks.\r\n\r\nA striking example of rapid alternations of pyroclastic material with\r\nordinary sediment lies far to the south in County Waterford, close\r\nto Dunhill Bridge, where a group of fine volcanic breccias and grits\r\nhas been laid bare by quarrying.[277] These strata consist of coarser\r\nand finer detritus, enclosing angular fragments of felsites and grey\r\nand black shale. The felsite-lapilli vary in texture, some of them\r\npresenting beautiful flow-structure. The stones are stuck at random\r\nthrough each bed, the largest being often at the bottom. The beds of\r\nbreccia vary from a few inches to a foot or more in thickness. There\r\ncan, I think, be little doubt that each of these breccia-bands points\r\nto a single volcanic explosion, whereby felsitic fragments were thrown\r\nout, mingled with pieces of the Silurian strata through which the vents\r\nwere drilled. In a vertical thickness of some fifty feet of rock there\r\nmust thus be a record of ten or twelve such explosions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: See Explanation of Sheets 167, 168, 178 and 179, Geol.\r\nSurv. Ireland, p. 56.]\r\n\r\nNearer the active vents the fragmental deposits become, as usual,\r\ncoarser and thicker. But I have not observed any thick masses of\r\ntuff like those of North Wales. So far as my examination has gone,\r\nthe tuffs are mainly felsitic. The so-called \"greenstone-ash\" of the\r\nSurvey maps is certainly in many cases not a true tuff. This term was\r\nproposed by Jukes for certain apple-green to olive-brown flaky fissile\r\nrocks only found \"in association with masses of greenstone.\"[278] Some\r\nyears ago I had occasion to make a series of traverses in Wicklow and\r\nWexford, and then convinced myself that in that part of the country\r\nthe \"greenstone-ashes\" were probably crushed bands of basic sills. Dr.\r\nHatch has proved this to be their origin from a series of microscopic\r\nslides prepared from specimens collected by himself on the ground.[279]\r\nIn other cases the \"greenstone-ashes\" seem to be excessively-cleaved\r\nor sheared felsites, which have acquired a soapy feel and a dull green\r\ncolour; but they also do include true tuffs. Thus, in one instance,\r\nat Ballyvoyle cross-roads, in the south of County Waterford, a\r\n\"greenstone-ash\" is a dull green tuff full of fragments of felspar\r\n(chiefly plagioclase) and pieces of dark andesitic lavas. Another\r\nexample may be found to the west of the Metal Man, near Tramore, where\r\nthe tuff is full of fragments of felspar and shale cemented in a\r\ngreenish-yellow material which may be palagonite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Explanation of Sheets 129, 130, p. 13 (1869).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: Explanation of Sheets 138, 139.]\r\n\r\nThe felsites of the south-east of Ireland form by much the largest\r\nproportion of the whole volcanic series. They occur as lenticular\r\nsheets from a few feet to several hundred feet in thickness, and\r\noccasionally traceable for some miles. On the whole, they are compact\r\ndull grey rocks, weathering with a white crust. A geologist familiar\r\nwith the contemporary lavas of North Wales cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith the absence of the coarse flow-structure so often characteristic\r\nof the felsites in that region. This structure, indeed, is not entirely\r\nabsent from the Irish rocks, but it occurs, so far, at least, as I have\r\nseen, rather as a fine streakiness than in the bold lenticular bands\r\nso common in Caernarvonshire. In like manner the nodular structure,\r\nthough not entirely absent, is rare.[280]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: In Waterford nodular felsites occur with concretions\r\nvarying from the size of a pea to several inches in diameter.\r\nExplanation to Sheets 167, 168, 178 and 179, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nUntil these felsites have been subjected to more detailed\r\ninvestigation, little can be said as to their petrography, and as to\r\nthe points of resemblance or difference between them and those of other\r\nLower Silurian districts in the United Kingdom. An important step,\r\nhowever, in this direction was taken by Dr. Hatch, who studied them\r\non the ground, in the laboratory, and with the microscope. He found\r\nthat some of them were soda-felsites or keratophyres (with albite as\r\ntheir felspar), that others were potash-felsites (with orthoclase as\r\ntheir felspar), while a third group contained both soda and potash, the\r\nlast-named greatly preponderating.[281] The existence of soda-felsites\r\nhad not been previously detected among British volcanic rocks, and it\r\nremains to be seen how far they may occur in the large and somewhat\r\nvaried group of rocks combined under the general term \"felsites.\" Dr.\r\nHatch believed that these rocks probably graduate into the normal or\r\northoclase felsites; but it has not yet been possible to test this\r\nview on the ground, nor to ascertain whether there is any essential\r\ndifference between the mode of occurrence of the two types.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: Explanation of Sheets 138, 139, p. 49; and _Geol. Mag._\r\n1889, p. 545.]\r\n\r\nBesides the more abundant felsites, occasional bands of andesite have\r\nbeen detected. Various other eruptive rocks occur, probably in most or\r\nall cases intrusive. Such are quartz-mica-diorites, quartz-diorites,\r\naugite-diorites or proterobases, dolerites, gabbros, diabases and\r\nepidiorites.[282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: _Guide to Irish Rock-Collections_, pp. 34, 35.]\r\n\r\nI have said that the chief theatre of eruption lay towards the\r\nsouth-west end of the volcanic belt of the south-east of Ireland. The\r\ncoast-line of County Waterford, from Tramore westward to Ballyvoyle\r\nHead--a distance of nearly fifteen miles--presents, perhaps, the\r\nmost wonderful series of sections of volcanic vents within the\r\nBritish Islands. No one coming from the inland is prepared for either\r\nthe striking character of the cliff scenery or the extraordinary\r\ngeological structure there presented, for the country is, on the whole,\r\nrather featureless, and much of it is smoothed over and obscured by\r\na covering of drift, through which occasional knobs of the harder\r\nfelsites protrude. The cliffs for mile after mile range from 100 to\r\n150 or 200 feet in height, and present naked vertical walls of rock,\r\ntrenched by occasional gullies, through which a descent may be made\r\nto the beach. Throughout the whole distance agglomerates and felsites\r\nsucceed each other in bewildering confusion, varied here and there by\r\nthe intercalation of Lower Silurian shales and limestones involved\r\nand pierced by the igneous rocks. Hardly any bedded volcanic material\r\nis to be recognized from one end to the other. The sea has laid bare\r\na succession of volcanic vents placed so close to each other that it\r\nwill be difficult or impossible to separate them out. A careful study\r\nand detailed mapping of this marvellous coast-section, however, is a\r\ntask well worthy of the labour of any one desirous of making himself\r\nacquainted with some of the conditions of volcanism during older\r\nPalæozoic time.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the section, black shales containing Llandeilo\r\ngraptolites, and calcareous bands full of Bala fossils, dip westward\r\nbelow a group of soda-felsites and felsitic tuffs, which seem to lie\r\nquite conformably on these strata. Here, then, we start with proof that\r\nthe volcanic eruptions of this locality began during some part of the\r\nBala period. But immediately to the west, these bedded igneous rocks\r\nare broken through by a neck of coarse agglomerate stuck full of chips\r\nand blocks of shale, some of them a foot long, with abundant fragments\r\nof scoriform and flinty felsites. Some columnar dykes of dolerite cut\r\nthrough the neck, and a larger intrusion seems to have risen up the\r\nsame funnel. The bedded tuffs appear again for a short distance, but\r\nthey are soon replaced by a tumultuous mass of agglomerate. And from\r\nthis part of the coast onwards for some distance all is disorder.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerates are crowded with blocks of various felsites and\r\nmicro-granites sometimes 18 inches in diameter, many of them presenting\r\nthe most exquisite streaky flow-structure. The angularity of these\r\nstones and the abrupt truncation of their lines of flow prove that they\r\nwere derived from the shattering of already consolidated rocks. In\r\nother places the ejected materials consist almost wholly of black shale\r\nfragments, but with an intermixture of felsite-lapilli.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the way in which the\r\nagglomerates are traversed by dykes, veins and bosses of various\r\nfelsites, and of how these break in endless confusion through each\r\nother. Some of the intrusive rocks are compact and amorphous, others\r\nare vesicular, others close-grained and columnar. Again and again they\r\npresent the most perfect flow-structure, and it is noticeable that the\r\nlines of flow follow the inequalities of the walls of the fissure up\r\nwhich the rock has ascended, and not only so, but even of the surfaces\r\nof detached blocks of shale or felsite which have been caught up and\r\nenclosed in the still moving mass.\r\n\r\nA few of these intrusive rocks were examined in thin slices by Dr.\r\nHatch. Most of them appear to be soda-felsites, but they include also\r\nrather decomposed rocks, some of which are probably diorites and\r\nquartz-diorites. Occasionally, thoroughly basic dykes (dolerite) may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this tumultuous assemblage of volcanic masses,\r\nrepresenting the roots of a group of ancient vents, there occur\r\noccasional interspaces occupied by ordinary stratified rocks. In the\r\neastern part of the section these consist mainly of black shale,\r\nsometimes with calcareous bands, from which a series of Bala fossils\r\nhas been obtained.[283] A very cursory examination suffices to show\r\nthat these intercalations do not mark pauses in the volcanic eruptions.\r\nThey are, in fact, portions of the marine accumulations under the\r\nsea-floor through which the vents were blown; they have been tossed\r\nabout, crushed and invaded by dykes and veins of felsite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: But see the _Geol. Survey Memoir_ on Sheets 167,\r\n168, 178 and 179, Ireland (1865), p. 28, for a description of the\r\nassociation of Bala and Llandeilo fossils on that coast-line.]\r\n\r\nBut certain other intercalated strips of stratified rocks present a\r\nspecial interest, for they bring before us examples of volcanic ashes\r\nthat gathered on the sea-floor, but which were disrupted by later\r\nexplosions. Thus, at the Knockmahon headland, well-bedded felspathic\r\ngrits and ashy shales occur, thrown in among the general mass of\r\neruptive material. As I have already remarked, it is difficult or\r\nimpossible to fix the horizons of the stratified patches that are\r\ninvolved among the igneous ejections of this coast-section, save where\r\nthey contain recognizable fossils, but the intercalation of true bedded\r\ntuffs among them is a proof that volcanic action had been in operation\r\nthere long before the outbreak of the vents which are now laid bare\r\nalong the cliffs.\r\n\r\nIn the south-east of Ireland there is the usual association of acid\r\nand basic sills with the evidence of a superficial outpouring of lavas\r\nand ashes. But these intrusive masses play a much less imposing part\r\nthan in Wales. They may be regarded, indeed, as bearing somewhat the\r\nsame proportion to the comparatively feeble display of extrusive rocks\r\nin this region that the abundant and massive sheets of Merionethshire\r\nand Caernarvonshire do to the enormous piles of lavas and tuffs which\r\noverlie them.\r\n\r\nAmong the acid intrusive sheets the most conspicuous are those mapped\r\nby the Survey as \"elvans.\" These rocks, as they occur in Wicklow\r\nand Wexford, have been examined by Dr. Hatch, who finds them to be\r\nmicro-granitic in structure, occasionally exhibiting micropegmatitic or\r\ngranophyric modifications.[284] The true stratigraphical relations of\r\nthese rocks have not yet been adequately investigated. Those of them\r\nwhich occur on the flanks of the great granite ridge are not improbably\r\nconnected with that mass, and if so are much younger than the Lower\r\nSilurian volcanoes.[285]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: Explanation of Sheets 138 and 139, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: The Leinster granite is certainly later than the Lower\r\nSilurian rocks and older than the Carboniferous rocks of the south-east\r\nof Ireland. It may belong to the great epoch of granite protrusion\r\nduring the Old Red Sandstone period.]\r\n\r\nThe basic sills, or \"greenstones,\" consist largely of diabase,\r\nfrequently altered into epidiorite; they include also varieties of\r\ndiorite.[286] That they were intruded before the plication and cleavage\r\nof the rocks among which they lie is well shown by their crushed and\r\nsheared margins where they are in thick mass, and by their cleaved\r\nand almost schistose condition where they are thinner. The intense\r\ncompression and crushing to which they have been subjected are well\r\nshown by the state of their component minerals, and notably by the\r\nparamorphism of the original augite into hornblende.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Dr. Hatch, _op. cit._ p. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of dykes associated with Silurian volcanic action is as\r\nnoticeable in the south-east of Ireland as it is in Wales. I have\r\nobserved a considerable number, indeed, but they are confined to the\r\nline of old vents on the Waterford coast, and, but for the clear\r\ncliff-sections cut by the sea, they would certainly have escaped\r\nobservation, for they make no feature on the ground in the interior.\r\nThey are sometimes distinctly columnar, and vary from less than a foot\r\nto many yards in width. They traverse both the agglomerates and the\r\nintrusive felsites. Most of them are of felsite, sometimes cellular;\r\nbut in some cases they are dolerites. There is obviously no clue to the\r\ndates of these dykes.\r\n\r\nThat some at least of the vents along the south coast of County\r\nWaterford may be vastly younger than the Lower Silurian rocks through\r\nwhich they have forced their way is suggested, if not proved, by\r\na section which is in some respects the most extraordinary of the\r\nwhole of this remarkable series. The occurrence of a group of red\r\nstrata was carefully noted by the late Mr. Du Noyer at Ballydouane\r\nBay, when he was engaged in carrying on the Geological Survey of that\r\npart of the country. At first he regarded them as belonging to the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, which comes on in great force only a few miles to\r\nthe west; but he subsequently arrived at the belief that they are\r\nreally an integral part of the Lower Silurian rocks of the district.\r\nProfessor Jukes had previously expressed himself in favour of this\r\nlatter idea, which was thought to receive support from the occurrence\r\nof some reddish strata in the Lower Silurian rocks of Tagoat, County\r\nWexford.[287]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: Explanation of Sheets 167, 168, 178 and 179 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Ireland (1865), pp. 10, 59.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of red rocks among Silurian strata, which are not\r\nusually red, might quite reasonably be looked for in the neighbourhood\r\nof Old Red Sandstone, Permian or Triassic deposits. If these deposits\r\nonce spread over the Silurian formations, a more or less decided\r\n\"raddling\" of the latter may have taken place. But in the present\r\ninstance, though the Old Red Sandstone begins not many miles to the\r\nwest, no such explanation of the colour of the strata is possible.\r\nThe cliffs of Ballydouane Bay consist of red sandstone, red sandy\r\nshale and conglomerate. The red tint is of that dull chocolate tone so\r\ncharacteristic of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. The conglomerates are\r\nimmense accumulations of ancient shingle, consisting largely of pieces\r\nof white vein-quartz and quartzite, sometimes a foot long and often\r\nwell water-worn. Some of the sandy beds are full of large scales of\r\nwhite mica, as if derived from some granitic or schistose region at no\r\ngreat distance. Taken as a whole, the strata are much less indurated\r\nand broken than the Silurian grits and shales of the district; some of\r\nthem, indeed, weather into mere incoherent sand that crumbles under the\r\nfingers. There does not appear to be any positive proof that the red\r\nrocks are truly bedded with the ordinary Silurian strata, the junctions\r\nbeing faulted or obscured by intrusive igneous masses.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the British Islands, so far as I am aware, is there a\r\nsimilar group of strata among the Lower Silurian rocks. If they belong\r\nto so ancient a series, they show that in the south of Ireland, during\r\nLower Silurian time, there arose a set of peculiar physical conditions\r\nprecisely like those that determined the accumulation of the Old Red\r\nSandstone in the same region at a later geological period. And in that\r\ncase it is hardly possible to conceive that these conditions could\r\nhave been confined to the extreme south of Ireland. We should certainly\r\nexpect to meet with evidence of them elsewhere, at least in the same\r\nSilurian region.[288]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: The nearest approach of any Silurian group of strata to\r\nthe character of these conglomerates is furnished by the remarkably\r\ncoarse conglomerates, boulder-beds and pebbly grits of the Bala and\r\nLlandovery series in the region between Killary Harbour and Lough Mask,\r\nto which further reference is made in a later part of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nWhile I hesitate to express a decided opinion in opposition to the\r\nconclusions of such experienced observers as Jukes and Du Noyer, I\r\nincline to believe that the rocks in question really belong to the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. If such shall finally be determined to be their\r\ngeological position, they will supply evidence that some at least of\r\nthe volcanic vents of the coast-line cannot be older than the Old\r\nRed Sandstone. They are pierced by masses of soda-felsite and by a\r\ncoarse red agglomerate containing abundant pieces of felsite. These\r\nvolcanic rocks belong to the same type as those which break through the\r\nundoubted Silurian rocks on either side. They may thus come to prove a\r\nrecrudescence of volcanic energy in this same district at a much later\r\ngeological period; and a new problem will arise to task the skill of\r\nthe most accomplished field-geologist and petrographer--to unravel\r\nthe structure and history of this chain of volcanic vents, and, in so\r\ndoing, to detect and separate the eruptions of Lower Silurian time from\r\nthose of the Lower Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the far west of Ireland, another group of Lower Silurian volcanoes\r\nhas left its remains in the mountainous tract of country between the\r\nwestern shores of Lough Mask and Killary Harbour.[289] There appear\r\nto have been at least three separate centres of eruption along a line\r\nstretching in a north-easterly direction for about 16 miles from the\r\nwestern end of Lough Nafooey to the hamlet of Derrindaffdery beyond\r\nTourmakeady, where the older rocks are unconformably overlain by the\r\nlower Carboniferous strata. As shown by the mapping of the Geological\r\nSurvey, the most northerly area, which may be called the Tourmakeady\r\ncentre, has a breadth of about a mile, and dies out southward after\r\na course of nearly six miles. About a mile to the south-west of the\r\nlast visible prolongation of its rocks, we encounter a second volcanic\r\ncentre which occupies an area of about a square mile in the valley of\r\nGlensaul. The third centre stretches from the western shores of Lough\r\nMask across Lough Nafooey, where it forms a mass of high rugged ground,\r\nand reaches a length of some six or seven miles before it finally dies\r\nout.[290]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: This group was placed in the Upper Silurian series\r\nby the officers of the Geological Survey who mapped the region\r\n(see Sheets 84, 85, 94 and 95 of the Geological Map of Ireland\r\nand accompanying Explanation), and on their testimony I formerly\r\nreferred to the volcanic rocks as of Upper Silurian age. Mr. Baily,\r\nhowever, had pointed out that the limestone associated with the\r\nlavas and agglomerates contains Bala fossils. Yet, in spite of\r\nthis palæontological testimony, the fossils were considered to be\r\n\"derivative,\" and the rocks were removed from the series of formations\r\nto which they would naturally be assigned. A recent examination of the\r\nground, in company with Mr. J. R. Kilroe of the Geological Survey,\r\nhas satisfied me that the volcanic rocks are interstratified with\r\nsedimentary deposits of Bala age, and must consequently be grouped with\r\nthe rest of the Lower Silurian series of Ireland. The results of this\r\nexamination are given in the text.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: These areas were carefully mapped for the Survey by Mr.\r\nNolan, and the lines of division marked by him fairly represent the\r\ngeneral distribution of the rocks.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks in each of these three areas are similar. One of their\r\ndistinguishing features is the intercalation among them of a\r\nfossiliferous limestone and calcareous fossiliferous tuffs, which\r\ncontain well-preserved species of organisms characteristic of the Bala\r\ndivision of the Lower Silurian rocks.[291] There cannot be any question\r\nthat these organisms were living at the time the strata in which their\r\nremains occur are found. The most delicate parts of the sculpture on\r\n_Illænus Bowmanni_ and _Orthis elegantula_ are well preserved. Nor\r\nhave the limestones been pushed into their present places by volcanic\r\nagency, or by faults in the terrestrial crust. They are not only\r\nregularly intercalated among the volcanic rocks, but the limestone in\r\nsome places abounds in volcanic dust, while above it come calcareous\r\ntuffs, also containing the same fossils. It is thus clearly established\r\nthat the volcanic series now to be described has its geological age\r\ndefinitely fixed as that of the Bala period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: See the list of fossils as determined by Mr. Baily in\r\n_Explanatory Memoir_ to accompany Sheets 73, 74, 83 and 84 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Ireland, p. 68 (1876).]\r\n\r\nThe lavas of the Lough Mask region consist of felsites and andesites\r\nwith rocks of probably more basic composition. The felsites are\r\ngenerally quartziferous porphyries, which occupy a considerable space\r\nin each of the three districts. To what extent they are intrusive\r\nrather than interstratified remains for investigation. Some of them\r\nhave undoubtedly invaded other members of the volcanic series. But, on\r\nthe other hand, fragments of similar quartz-porphyries and felsites\r\nabound in the intercalated bands of volcanic breccia.\r\n\r\nThe andesites and more basic lavas are finely-crystalline or\r\ncompact, dull-green to chocolate-purple rocks, often resembling the\r\n\"porphyrites\" of the Old Red Sandstone. Some of them are strongly\r\nvesicular, the cavities being filled with calcite on fresh fracture,\r\nthough empty on weathered surfaces. The sack-like or pillow structure,\r\nalready referred to as characteristic of many Lower Silurian lavas,\r\nappears conspicuously among some of these rocks. At Bohaun, nine miles\r\nsouth from Westport, where a prolongation of the volcanic series\r\nrises to the surface from under the overlying coarse conglomerates,\r\nI observed that, owing to the compression which the rocks have there\r\nundergone, the pillow-shaped blocks have been squeezed together into\r\nrudely polygonal forms, while their vesicles have been greatly drawn\r\nout in the direction of tension. Where the rocks have been still\r\nmore sheared, the distinct pillow-shaped blocks with their vesicular\r\nstructure disappear, while the more fine-grained crusts that surround\r\nthem have been broken up and appear as fragments involved in a matrix\r\nof green schist.\r\n\r\nIntercalated with the lavas are numerous bands of volcanic breccia and\r\nfine tuff. The stones in these breccias consist chiefly of various\r\nfelsites with andesites and more basic lavas. But pieces of jasper,\r\nchert, shale and grit are not infrequent. In some places abundant\r\nblocks of black shale are to be noticed, probably derived from the\r\nLlandeilo group which exists below, and which has here and there been\r\nridged up to the surface in the midst of the volcanic rocks.[292]\r\nNear Shangort I noticed in one of these breccias one block measuring\r\n12 feet, another 20 feet in length and 3 or 4 feet thick, composed of\r\nalternating bands of grit and slate. It is interesting to note that\r\nthese strata had already undergone cleavage before disruption, the\r\nbands of slate being strongly cleaved obliquely to the bedding. None\r\nof the Llandeilo or other rocks in the neighbourhood display this\r\nstructure. The blocks seem to have been derived from some deeper group\r\nof strata. They are laid down parallel with the rude bedding of the\r\nbreccia in which they lie.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: In re-examining this region, Mr. Kilroe has found in the\r\nstream west of the monastery, Tourmakeady, an uprise of graptolitic\r\nblack shale containing forms belonging to the very lowest Llandeilo or\r\nUpper Arenig strata, and a similar band above Leenane, Killary Harbour.]\r\n\r\nThe fine tuffs and thin ashy limestones associated with the thicker\r\nband of limestone show the renewal of volcanic explosions after the\r\ninterval marked by the calcareous deposit which is sometimes 20 or\r\n40 feet thick. In many places this limestone is brecciated and much\r\nmingled with volcanic dust and lapilli. At Shangort, for example, the\r\nthick tolerably pure limestone is truncated on the west and north sides\r\nby a coarse agglomerate probably filling a volcanic vent. A few hundred\r\nyards further north, beyond the interrupting agglomerate, the limestone\r\nreappears on the same line of strike, but is then found to be nodular\r\nand brecciated and much mingled with volcanic detritus. It lies among\r\nashy grits and tuffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Diagram of the general relations of the\r\ndifferent groups of rock in the Lower Silurian volcanic district along\r\nthe western shore of Lough Mask.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Llandeilo shales, cherts and grits; _b_, Volcanic breccias;\r\n     _c_, Felsites and andesites; _d_, Tuffs and ashy grits and\r\n     shales; _e_, Limestone with Bala fossils; _f_, Calcareous\r\n     tuffs and thin bands of ashy limestone with fossils; _g_,\r\n     Coarse conglomerate and grits; _h_, Wenlock strata resting\r\n     unconformably on the Bala rocks and passing southwards from\r\n     these to overlie an older series of schists; *, Fault.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the ground occupied by the Lough Mask volcanic\r\nrocks is diagrammatically represented in Fig. 64. The thickness of the\r\nvolcanic series must amount to many hundred feet, but it has not been\r\nprecisely determined. The uppermost parts of the series pass under a\r\ngreat thickness of coarse conglomerates and pebbly grits which form\r\nthe ridge of Formnamore, and stretch thence westwards along Killary\r\nHarbour and through the Mweelrea mountains. These strata are classed\r\nas the Upper Silurian on the Geological Survey map. Since, however,\r\nthey conformably overlie rocks containing Bala fossils, and in the\r\nKillary district include green shales which have yielded fossils of the\r\nsame age, they doubtless belong in large part to the Lower Silurian\r\ndivision. The remarkable coarseness of these conglomerates towards the\r\nsouth, and their rapid passage into much finer grits and shales towards\r\nthe north, probably indicate that they were formed close to the shores\r\nof a land composed of schistose rocks, quartzite and granite, of which\r\nthe mountainous tracts of Connemara are the last relics.\r\n\r\nA base to the volcanic series is found in the occasional uprise of\r\na short axis of Llandeilo, or perhaps even upper Arenig strata,\r\ncontaining bands of dark chert and black graptolitic shales.\r\nUnfortunately the relations of these underlying rocks to the volcanic\r\nmasses are not very clear, being obscured by superficial accumulations\r\nand also by faulting. It is thus hardly possible to be certain whether\r\nthey pass up conformably into the base of the volcanic series, or are\r\ncovered by it unconformably.\r\n\r\nThe position of this isolated volcanic district in the far west of\r\nIreland, the abundance, variety and thickness of the erupted materials,\r\nand the definite intercalation of these materials in the Bala or\r\nhighest division of the Lower Silurian series, acquire a special\r\ninterest from the history of the nearest Silurian volcanic area which\r\nhas now to be described--that of the western shores of the Dingle\r\npromontory.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Upper Silurian Series\r\n\r\nThe latest volcanic eruptions of Silurian time yet definitely known\r\ntook place during the accumulation of the Wenlock and Ludlow rocks in\r\nthe far west of Ireland. No satisfactory record of any contemporaneous\r\nphenomena of a like kind has yet been met with in any other Upper\r\nSilurian district in the British Isles, unless at Tortworth in\r\nGloucestershire, as above described. So far as at present known, only\r\none centre of activity has been preserved. It lies among the headlands\r\nof Kerry, where the land projects furthest west into the stormy\r\nAtlantic. The occurrence of volcanic rocks in this remote area and\r\ntheir geological horizon have been clearly indicated on the maps of the\r\nGeological Survey. More than thirty years, however, have elapsed since\r\nsome of the mapping was done, and we must therefore be prepared to find\r\nit, more especially in its petrography, capable of modification and\r\nimprovement now.\r\n\r\nIn the country known as the Dingle promontory, these traces of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic rocks are to be observed at various localities\r\nand on several horizons. To the east, near Anascaul, on the northern\r\nshore of Dingle Bay, some tuffs occur in what are believed to be\r\nLlandovery strata. But it is on the western coast, among the headlands\r\nand coves that lie to the north and south of Clogher Head, that the\r\nbest sections are to be seen. The succession of the rocks in this\r\nlocality was well worked out by Du Noyer, and the Memoir prepared by\r\nhim, with the general introduction by Jukes, is an invaluable guide to\r\nthe geologist who would explore this somewhat inaccessible region.[293]\r\nThe most important correction that will require to be made in the work\r\narises from a mistake as to the true nature of certain rocks which were\r\ndescribed as pisolitic tuffs, but which are nodular felsites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: Sheets 160 and 171 of the one-inch map, and Memoir on\r\nSheets 160, 161, 171 and 172.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most striking geological feature of this singularly\r\ninteresting and impressive coast-line is to be found in the\r\ninterstratification of lavas with bands of tuff among abundantly\r\nfossiliferous strata which, from their organic contents, are\r\nunmistakably of the age of the Wenlock group. These lavas occur in\r\na number of sheets, separated from each other by tuffs and other\r\nfragmental deposits. They thus point to a series of eruptions over a\r\nsea-bottom that teemed with Upper Silurian life. They consist for the\r\nmost part of remarkably fine typical nodular felsites. The nodules vary\r\nin dimensions from less than a pea to the size of a hen's egg. They\r\nare sometimes hollow and lined with quartz-crystals. They vary greatly\r\nin number, some parts being almost free from them and others entirely\r\nmade up of them. The matrix, where a fresh fracture can be obtained, is\r\nhorny in texture, and often exhibits an exceedingly beautiful and fine\r\nflow-structure. On weathered faces there may be seen thick parallel\r\nstrips and lenticles of flow-structure like those of the Snowdon\r\nlavas. The upper portions of some of the sheets enclose fragments of\r\nforeign rocks. The microscopic examination of a few slices cut from\r\nthese lavas shows them to be true felsites (rhyolites) composed of\r\na microcrystalline aggregate of quartz and felspar, with layers and\r\npatches of cryptocrystalline matter, and only occasional porphyritic\r\ncrystals of orthoclase and plagioclase.\r\n\r\nThe pyroclastic rocks associated with these lavas vary from exceedingly\r\nfine tuff to coarse agglomerate. Some of the finer tuffs contain\r\npumiceous fragments and pieces of grey and red shale; they pass into\r\nfine ashy sandstones and shales, crowded with fossils, and into\r\ngravelly breccias made up of fragments of different volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary of these intercalated fragmental strata is\r\na breccia or agglomerate, about 15 feet thick, which lies in a thick\r\ngroup of fossiliferous dull-yellow, ashy and ochreous sandstones. The\r\nstones of this bed consist chiefly of blocks of different felsites,\r\nvarying up to three feet in length. Some of them show most perfect\r\nflow-structure; others are spongy and cellular, like lumps of pumice.\r\nThe calcareous sandstone on the top of the breccia is crowded with\r\nfossils chiefly in the form of empty casts, and the same material,\r\nstill full of brachiopods, crinoids, corals, etc., fills up the\r\ninterstices among the blocks down to the bottom of the breccia, where\r\nsimilar fossiliferous strata underlie it.\r\n\r\nNowhere has the volcanic history of a portion of Palæozoic time been\r\nmore clearly and eloquently recorded than in this remote line of\r\ncliffs swept by the gales of the Atlantic. We see that the ordinary\r\nsedimentation of Upper Silurian time was quietly proceeding, fine mud\r\nand sand being deposited, and enclosing the remains of the marine\r\norganisms that swarmed over the sea-bottom when volcanic eruptions\r\nbegan. First came discharges of fine dust and small stones, which\r\nsometimes fell so lightly as not seriously to disturb the fauna on the\r\nsea-floor, but at other times followed so rapidly and continuously as\r\nto mask the usual sediment and form sheets of tuff and volcanic gravel.\r\nOccasionally there would come more paroxysmal explosions, whereby\r\nlarge blocks of lava were hurled forth until they gathered in a thick\r\nlayer over the bottom. But the life that teemed in the sea, though\r\ntemporarily destroyed or driven out, soon returned. Corals, crinoids\r\nand shells found their way back again, and fine sediment carried their\r\nremains with it and filled up the crevices. The ejected volcanic blocks\r\nare thus enclosed in a highly fossiliferous matrix.\r\n\r\nA succession of lava-streams, of which the strongly-nodular sheet of\r\nClogher Head is the thickest and most conspicuous, mark the culmination\r\nof the volcanic energy, and show how at this late part of the Silurian\r\nperiod felsites that reproduce some of the most striking peculiarities\r\nof earlier time were once more poured out at the surface. A few more\r\ndischarges of tuff and the outflow of a greenish flinty felsite brought\r\nthis series of eruptions to an end, and closed in Britain the long and\r\nvaried record of older Palæozoic volcanic activity.[294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: As this sheet is passing through the press, the\r\ninteresting paper by Messrs. S. H. Reynolds and C. J. Gardiner, \"On the\r\nKildare Inlier\" has appeared (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. lii. p.\r\n587).

G.\r\n  Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANOES OF DEVONIAN AND OLD RED SANDSTONE TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE DEVONIAN VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole region of the British Isles, wherever the\r\nuppermost strata of the Silurian system can be seen to graduate into\r\nany later series of sedimentary deposits, they are found to pass up\r\nconformably into an enormous accumulation of red sandstones, marls,\r\ncornstones, and conglomerates, which have long been grouped together\r\nunder the name of \"Old Red Sandstone.\" In England and Wales, in\r\nScotland and in Ireland, this upward succession is so well shown that\r\nat first British geologists were naturally disposed to believe it to\r\nrepresent the normal order of the geological record. When, however,\r\nSedgwick and Murchison demonstrated that in the counties of Devon\r\nand Cornwall a very different group of strata contained an abundant\r\nassemblage of organic remains, including types which Lonsdale showed\r\nto be intermediate between those of the Silurian and the Carboniferous\r\nsystems; when, moreover, this palæontological facies of the south-west\r\nof England, termed by its discoverers \"Devonian,\" was found to be\r\nabundantly developed on the Continent, and to be there indeed the\r\nprevalent stratigraphical type of the formations intervening between\r\nSilurian and Carboniferous, geologists began to perceive that the\r\nOld Red Sandstone must be regarded as the record of peculiar local\r\nconditions of sedimentation, while the Devonian type was evidently the\r\nmore usual development of the same geological period.\r\n\r\nFrom the remote Shetland Isles, across the whole of Scotland and\r\nEngland, down to the northern shores of the Bristol Channel, the Old\r\nRed Sandstone maintains its general characters. Nowhere, indeed, are\r\nthese characters more typically developed than in South Wales, where\r\nmany thousands of feet of red sediments, almost entirely devoid of\r\norganic remains, emerge from under the escarpments of Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, and stretch into broad uplands until they are lost at the\r\ntop of the Silurian system.\r\n\r\nBut when the geologist crosses the Bristol Channel to the opposite\r\nshores of North Devon, he encounters a remarkably different assemblage\r\nof rocks. It is true that he has not yet been able to detect there any\r\nequivalents of the uppermost Silurian strata of Glamorganshire, nor\r\ndoes he find any conspicuous band of Carboniferous Limestone, such as\r\nthat which encircles the Welsh Coal-field. He is thus unable to start\r\nfrom a known definite horizon in the attempt to work out the order of\r\nsuccession, either in an upward or downward direction. Lithological\r\ncharacters likewise afford him no means of establishing any\r\nsatisfactory parallelism. As he follows the Devonian strata, however,\r\nhe finds them to disappear conformably under the Culm-measures, which,\r\nthough strangely unlike the Carboniferous strata on the opposite coast,\r\nare yet proved by their fossils to belong to the Carboniferous system.\r\nHence the Devonian type, like the Old Red Sandstone, is proved to be\r\nimmediately anterior to, and to graduate into, the Carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nThere is no stratigraphical change in Britain so rapid and complete as\r\nthat from the Old Red Sandstone on the one side of the Bristol Channel\r\nto the Devonian series on the other. No satisfactory explanation has\r\nyet been found for this sudden transformation, which still remains one\r\nof the unsolved problems in British geology.\r\n\r\nAs the observer follows the Devonian assemblage across the land to\r\nthe southern coast-line, he is conscious that its general characters,\r\nboth lithological and palæontological, depart more and more from the\r\ntype of the Old Red Sandstone, and approach more closely to the common\r\nDevonian facies of the Continent. He is forced to admit that the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, notwithstanding its extensive development in Britain,\r\nmust be regarded as an exceptional type of sedimentation, while the\r\nDevonian facies represents that which is most widely prevalent, not\r\nonly in Europe, but generally over the world.\r\n\r\nThe broad estuary of the Bristol Channel unfortunately conceals from\r\nview the tract which lies between the typical Old Red Sandstone of\r\nGlamorganshire and the typical Devonian formations of Devonshire.\r\nWhether this intervening space of some fifteen miles was occupied by\r\na physical barrier, which separated the respective areas of deposit\r\nof these two types, or the circumstances of sedimentation in the one\r\nregion merged insensibly into those of the other, must remain matter\r\nfor speculation.\r\n\r\nThe geographical conditions betokened by the Old Red Sandstone will\r\nbe considered in the next chapter. There can be no doubt that those\r\nindicated by the Devonian system were marine. The organic remains\r\nso plentifully distributed through the argillaceous and arenaceous\r\nsediments of that system, and so crowded together in its limestones,\r\nwere obviously denizens of the open sea. Yet the only tract of Britain\r\nover which this sea can be shown to have spread was the south of\r\nEngland. To the north of that belt, the site of Britain during Devonian\r\ntime appears to have been partly land and partly wide water-basins in\r\nwhich the Old Red Sandstone was deposited.\r\n\r\nIn that half terrestrial half lacustrine territory that stretched\r\nnorthwards to beyond the Shetland Isles, many volcanoes were active,\r\nof which the chronicles will be described in later pages. The most\r\nsoutherly of these centres of eruption yet known was the district of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills. Throughout the rest of England and Wales no trace\r\nof any contemporary volcanic action has been detected in the Old Red\r\nSandstone. It is true that over most of that region rocks of this age\r\nhave been concealed under younger formations. Yet throughout Wales,\r\nwhere the Old Red Sandstone attains so vast a thickness, and covers so\r\nwide an area, it has not yet yielded a vestige of any contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nBut over the sea-floor that covered the south of England, and stretched\r\nthence into the heart of Europe, abundant volcanoes have left behind\r\nthem proofs of their activity. The first geologist who recognized these\r\nproofs and traced their extent on the ground appears to have been De la\r\nBeche, who, by his detailed maps and careful description of the igneous\r\nrocks of Devonshire, did so much to advance the study of ancient\r\nvolcanic action. This great pioneer not only determined the former\r\nexistence of Devonian volcanoes, but he was likewise the first to\r\ndetect and map the volcanic rocks associated with the Carboniferous and\r\n\"New Red Sandstone\" formations of the same region. The broad outlines\r\ntraced by him among the volcanic products of these three geological\r\nperiods in the south-west of England still remain but little changed.\r\nNor are they likely to be much improved until the ground is resurveyed\r\non a larger and more accurate map, and with better petrographical\r\nequipment than were available in his day.\r\n\r\nNot long after the observations of De la Beche came those of A. C.\r\nGodwin-Austen, who devoted much time to a sedulous exploration of\r\nthe rocks of South Devon, and satisfied himself that contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic sheets were intercalated among the limestones of that\r\ndistrict. \"The coral limestones,\" he says, \"are in many places\r\nsuperincumbent on great sheets of volcanic materials, with which, in\r\nsome instances, as at North Whilborough, they alternate.\" He pointed\r\nout that the interstratified volcanic rocks are of two periods, one\r\nDevonian and the other Carboniferous.[295]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd ser. vol. vi. (1842), pp. 465,\r\n470, 473.]\r\n\r\nIn his Geological Maps of Devon and Cornwall, which are to the present\r\ntime those issued by the Geological Survey, De la Beche made no attempt\r\nto discriminate between the varieties of igneous rocks, save that\r\nthe basic \"greenstones\" were distinguished from the acid bosses of\r\ngranite and the elvans. But in his classic \"Report\" much more detail\r\nwas inserted, showing that he clearly recognized the existence both\r\nof volcanic ashes and of lavas, as well as of intrusive sheets. At\r\nthe outset of his account of the \"Grauwacke,\" he remarks that the\r\nsedimentary deposits are accompanied with igneous products, \"a portion\r\nof which may also be termed sedimentary, inasmuch as it would seem\r\nto have been deposited in beds among contemporaneous rocks of the\r\nformer description by the agency of water, after having been ejected\r\nfrom fissures or craters in the shape of ashes and cinders, precisely\r\nas we may now expect would happen with the ashes and cinders ejected\r\nfrom volcanoes, particularly insular and littoral volcanoes, into the\r\nsea.\"[296] Again he speaks of \"two kinds of trappean rocks having\r\nprobably been erupted, one in the state of igneous fusion, and the\r\nother in that of ash, during the time that the mud, now forming slates,\r\nwas deposited, the mixtures of volcanic and sedimentary materials\r\nbeing irregular from the irregular action of the respective causes\r\nwhich produced them; so that though the one may have been derived\r\nfrom igneous action, and the other from the ordinary abrasion of\r\npre-existing solid rocks, they were geologically contemporaneous.\"[297]\r\nHe recognized the origin of the amygdaloidal varieties of rock, and by\r\ndissolving out the calcite from their cells showed how close was their\r\nresemblance to modern pumice.[298]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: \"Report on the Geology of Cornwall, Devon and West\r\nSomerset,\" _Mem.

(1893), p. 385.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the geological structure of the Palæozoic rocks of the\r\nSouth-west of England has been complicated to an amazing extent by\r\nplication and fracture, with concomitant cleavage and metamorphism.\r\nHence it is a task of extreme difficulty to trace out with any\r\ncertainty definite stratigraphical horizons, and to determine the range\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic action. Mr. Ussher has shown with what\r\nsuccess this task may be accomplished when it is pursued on a basis of\r\nminute mapping, combined with a sedulous collection and determination\r\nof fossils.[306] But years must necessarily elapse before such detailed\r\nwork is carried over the whole Devonian region, and probably not till\r\nthen will the story of the volcanic history of the rocks be adequately\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: See Memoir cited in a previous note.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it has been established that while there is a\r\nsingular absence of igneous rocks in North Devon, a strip of country\r\nextending from Newton Abbot and Torquay westwards by Plymouth across\r\nCornwall to Penzance contains abundant records of volcanic action. It\r\nhas not yet been possible to map out, among what were formerly all\r\ngrouped together as \"greenstones,\" the respective limits of the bedded\r\nlavas and the tuffs, to distinguish the true sills, and to fix on the\r\nposition of the chief vents of eruption. So intense have been the\r\ncompression and shearing of the rocks that solid sheets of diabase have\r\nbeen crushed into fissile schists, which can hardly be distinguished\r\nfrom tuffs. Moreover, owing perhaps in large measure to the mantle\r\nof red Permian (or Triassic) strata, which has been stripped off by\r\ndenudation from large tracts of this region once overspread by it, the\r\nDevonian rocks have been deeply \"raddled,\" or stained red. But probably\r\none of the main sources of difficulty in studying the petrography of\r\nthe area is to be found in the results of atmospheric weathering.\r\nDevonshire lies in that southern non-glaciated strip of England, where\r\nthe rocks have been undergoing continuous decay since long before the\r\nIce Age. No ploughshare of ice has there swept off the deep weathered\r\ncrust, so as to leave hard surfaces of rock, fresh and bare, under a\r\nprotecting sheet of boulder-clay. It is seldom that a really fresh\r\npiece of any igneous rock can be procured among the lanes and shallow\r\npits of Devon, where alone, for the most part, the materials are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nMuch, therefore, remains to be done, both in the stratigraphy and\r\npetrography of the Devonian volcanic rocks of this country. To the late\r\nJ. A. Phillips geology is indebted for the first detailed chemical and\r\nmicroscopical investigation of these rocks. He clearly showed the truly\r\nvolcanic origin of many of the so-called \"greenstones.\" He believed\r\nthat certain \"slaty blue elvans,\" which he found to have a composition\r\nidentical with that of altered dolerites, might be highly metamorphosed\r\ntuffs, and that others might have been originally sheets of volcanic\r\nmud. After studying the chemical composition and minute structure\r\nof a large collection of \"greenstones,\" he demonstrated that in all\r\nessential particulars they were dolerites, though somewhat altered from\r\ntheir original character.[307] Subsequently they were studied by Dr.\r\nHatch, who found the fresher specimens generally to possess an ophitic\r\nstructure, while some are granular, others porphyritic.[308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: See especially _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xxxii.\r\nand xxxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: A few of the eruptive rocks of Devonshire have recently\r\nbeen studied by K. Busz. He finds most of his specimens (chiefly from\r\nthe Torquay district) to be varieties of diabase, but describes a\r\npalæopicrite from Highweek near Newton Bushel, and a kersantite from\r\nSouth Brent on the south-east edge of Dartmoor (_Neues Jahrb._ 1896, p.\r\n57).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the rocks have undergone so much crushing, solid cores of\r\nthem, showing the original structure, may be obtained, also examples\r\nof the amygdaloidal, vesicular or slaggy character. They occur\r\nin sheets either singly or in groups, and appear generally to be\r\nregularly interstratified in the slates and grits. While some of\r\nthese intercalations, especially the amygdaloidal sheets, may be\r\ntrue superficial lavas, it can hardly be doubted that others are\r\nsills, especially those which assume the crystalline structure and\r\ncomposition of gabbros, and show an entire absence of the vesicular\r\nstructure. But no one has yet attempted to separate the two types from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nWith these rocks are associated abundant diabase-tuffs (schalstein),\r\nfrequently mingled with ordinary non-volcanic detrital matter, and\r\nshading off into the surrounding grits and slates. There is thus clear\r\nevidence of the outpouring of basic lavas and showers of ashes during\r\nthe Devonian period in the south-west of England, under conditions\r\nanalogous to those which characterized the deposition of the Devonian\r\nsystem in Nassau and the Harz.\r\n\r\nThe exact range of these eruptions in geological time has still to be\r\nascertained. So far as at present determined, volcanic activity was not\r\nawakened during the accumulation of the Lower Devonian formations. It\r\nwas not until the sporadic coral-reefs and shell-banks had grown up,\r\nwhich form the basement limestones of the Middle Devonian group, that\r\nthe first eruptions took place. As Godwin-Austen, Champernowne and Mr.\r\nUssher have shown, some of these reefs were overwhelmed with streams\r\nof lava or buried under showers of ashes. The volcanic discharges,\r\nhowever, were peculiarly local, probably from many scattered vents,\r\nand never on any great scale. Some districts remained little or not at\r\nall affected by them, so that the growth of limestone went on without\r\ninterruption, or at least with no serious break. In other areas again\r\nthe place of the limestone is taken by volcanic materials.\r\n\r\nThe chief epoch of this volcanic action, marked by the \"Ashprington\r\nVolcanic Series,\" appears to have occurred about midway in the Middle\r\nDevonian period. But in certain districts it extended into Upper\r\nDevonian time. Intrusive sills of diabase may mark the later phases\r\nof the volcanic history. But the occurrence of such sills even in the\r\nUpper Devonian rocks, and the alteration of the strata in contact with\r\nthem (spilosite), point to the continuance or renewal of subterranean\r\ndisturbance even in the later Devonian ages, if not in subsequent\r\ngeological time. That volcanic activity accompanied the deposition of\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks of Devonshire has long been well known (see\r\nChapter xxix.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANOES OF THE OLD RED SANDSTONE\r\n\r\n  Geological Revolutions at the close of the Silurian\r\n     Period--Physical Geography of the Old Red Sandstone--Old\r\n     Lake-basins, their Flora and Fauna--Abundance of\r\n     Volcanoes--History of Investigation in the Subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the consideration of the records of a notable era in\r\nthe geological evolution of north-western Europe. Up to the close of\r\nthe Silurian period the long history embodied in the rocks presents\r\na constant succession of slowly sinking sea-floors. Wide tracts of\r\nocean stretched over most of Europe, and across the shifting bottom,\r\nsand and mud, washed from lands that have long vanished, spread in\r\nan ever-accumulating pile. Now and then, some terrestrial movement\r\nof more than usual potency upraised this monotonous sea-bed, but the\r\nold conditions of ceaseless waste continued, and fresh sheets of\r\ndetritus were thrown down upon the broken-up heaps of older sediment.\r\nAll through the vast cycles of time denoted by these accumulations of\r\nstrata, generations of sea-creatures came and went in long procession,\r\nleaving their relics amidst the ooze of the bottom. Genera and\r\nfamilies, once abundant, gradually died out, and gave place to others,\r\nthe onward march of life being slow but uninterrupted. Of the land of\r\nthe time or of the plants and animals that lived on its surface, hardly\r\nanything is known. The chronicles that have come down to us are almost\r\nwholly records of the vicissitudes of the ocean-bed.\r\n\r\nOver the centre and south of Europe, the marine conditions of Silurian\r\ntime were prolonged, as we have seen, into the next period, when the\r\nDevonian formations were deposited. In that wide region, no marked\r\nbreak has been traced between either the sedimentation or the animal\r\nlife of the Silurian and Devonian periods. But in the north-west of\r\nEurope a striking departure took place from the protracted monotony of\r\nmarine conditions. By a series of terrestrial movements that affected\r\nthe area lying to the north of the line of the Bristol Channel, and\r\nextended not only to the furthest limit of the British Isles, but\r\nprobably as far as Norway, and perhaps even into northern Russia,\r\nthe previous widespread conditions of marine sedimentation were\r\nentirely altered. Instead of the fine oceanic silts and sands with\r\ntheir abundant organic remains, and the thick limestones with their\r\nmasses of coral and crowds of crinoids, there were now laid down, over\r\nthese northern regions, vast piles of deep red sediment, from which\r\ntraces of animal life are almost wholly absent. The shelving land\r\nagainst which these ferruginous sands and gravels gathered can still\r\nin part be recognized. As the observer follows its margin, notes the\r\nvarying local peculiarities of its sediment, and detects, sometimes\r\nin great abundance, remains of the vegetation which clothed it, the\r\nconviction grows in his mind that the remarkable contrast between these\r\ndeposits, known as the Old Red Sandstone, and those of the Silurian and\r\nDevonian systems is not to be accounted for by any mere rearrangement\r\nof the sea-bottom, or redistribution of the land that supplied that\r\nsea-bottom with sediment. It has long been the general belief among\r\ngeologists that the subterranean movements which, over the greater part\r\nof Britain, brought the deposition of the Upper Silurian formations\r\nto a close, led to a total alteration of the geography of the region\r\naffected, that the sea-floor was elevated, and that, over the upraised\r\ntract, large lakes or inland seas were eventually formed, in which the\r\npeculiar sediments of the Old Red Sandstone were accumulated.\r\n\r\nThe records of this series of geographical changes are too fragmentary\r\nto enable us to follow, except in a very general way, the sequence of\r\nevents in the transformation of the Silurian sea into the peculiar\r\ntopographical conditions in which the Old Red Sandstone was laid down.\r\nWhile there was a widespread elevation of the sea-floor, and of such\r\nridges of insular land as may have risen above sea-level, the upheaval\r\nappears to have been of a somewhat complicated kind, and to have been\r\ncombined with many local subsidences. The area of disturbance was\r\nprobably thrown into a series of parallel ridges and troughs, the\r\nformer continuing to be pushed upward, while the latter tended to\r\nsubside. The ridges thus became land surfaces, and their prolonged\r\nelevation may have more or less compensated for the denudation to\r\nwhich, on their emergence, they were necessarily exposed. The troughs,\r\non the other hand, which sank down, may in many cases have subsided\r\nbelow the sea. But where the general upheaval of the crust was most\r\npronounced, some of the depressions would be isolated above sea-level\r\nand become lake-basins in the terrestrial areas.\r\n\r\nOf some of these water-basins the outlines can still in some measure\r\nbe defined. The rocks that rose into hills around them, and from which\r\ntheir enormous accumulations of detritus were derived, still partially\r\nsurvive. We can explore these piles of sediment, and from them can form\r\nsome idea of the condition of the water in the lakes, and the nature\r\nof the vegetation on the surrounding land. The frequent occurrence\r\nand exceeding coarseness of the conglomerates, which appear on many\r\nsuccessive horizons throughout the deposits of these basins, probably\r\nindicate contemporaneous terrestrial disturbances. The same causes that\r\nled to the wrinkling of the crust into parallel ridges and troughs\r\nno doubt still continued in operation. From time to time the ridges,\r\nmuch worn down by prolonged denudation, were pushed upward, either by\r\ngradual uprise or by more rapid jerks. The troughs may in like manner\r\nhave been still affected by their old tendency to subsidence. Hence, in\r\nspite of the effects of degradation and deposition, it is possible that\r\nthe ridges may not, on the whole, have varied much in height, nor the\r\nbasins in depth, during the time when thousands of feet were stripped\r\noff the land and strewn in detritus over the bottoms of the lakes.\r\n\r\nLet us try to realize a little more definitely the general aspect of\r\nthe region in which the Old Red Sandstone water-basins lay. As the\r\naxes of the folds into which the crust of the earth was thrown ran in\r\na north-east and south-west direction, they gave this trend to the\r\nlakes and to the tracts of land that separated them. These intervening\r\nridges must in some instances have been hilly or even mountainous.\r\nThus, the Scottish Highlands rose between two of the lakes, and poured\r\ninto them an abundant tribute of gravel, sand and silt. The terrestrial\r\nvegetation of the time has been partially preserved. The hills seem\r\nto have been clothed with conifers, while the lower slopes and swamps\r\nwere green with sigillariæ, lepidodendra and calamites. One of the most\r\ncharacteristic plants was _Psilophyton_, of which large matted sheets\r\nwere drifted across the lakes and entombed in the silt of the bottom.\r\nA grass-like vegetation, with long linear leaves, seems to have grown\r\nthickly in some of the shallows of the lakes.\r\n\r\nOf the land animals we have still less knowledge than of the\r\nvegetation. Doubtless various forms of insect life flitted through the\r\nwoodlands, though no relics of their forms have yet been recovered. But\r\nthe remains of myriapods have been found in Forfarshire.[309] These\r\nearly relics of the animal life of the land inhabited the woodlands,\r\nlike our modern gally-worms, and were swept down into the lakes,\r\ntogether with large quantities of vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: Mr. B. N. Peach, _Proceedings of Royal Physical Society\r\nof Edinburgh_, vol. vii. (1882).]\r\n\r\nSome of the lakes, especially in the earlier part of their history,\r\nabounded in eurypterid crustacea. These animals inhabited the seas\r\nin Upper Silurian time, and appear to have been isolated in the\r\nwater-basins of the Old Red Sandstone. Certain species of Pterygotus,\r\na Silurian genus found also in the Lower Old Red Sandstone, reached a\r\nlength of six feet. But the most abundant forms of animal life were\r\nfishes. These furnish additional evidence in favour of the lacustrine\r\nnature of the waters in which they lived. Such characteristically\r\nmarine forms as the sharks and rays of the Silurian seas were replaced\r\nby genera of Acanthodians, Ostracoderms, Dipnoids, Teleostomes,\r\nPlacoderms, and Palæoniscids, which abounded in the more northerly\r\nwaters. The distinctive outward characters of many of these early\r\nvertebrates were their bony scales and plates. Some of them had their\r\nheads encased in an armature of bone, of large size and massive\r\nthickness. In several genera the bone was coated with a layer of\r\nglittering enamel. Even now, after the vast lapse of time since their\r\nday, the cuirasses and scale-armour of these fishes keep their bright\r\nsheen in the hardened sand and mud from which they are disinterred.\r\n\r\nA difference is observable between the faunas of the different\r\nwater-basins. Even where the same genus occurs in two adjacent\r\nareas, the species are often distinct. Two large lakes, separated\r\nby the tract of the Scottish Highlands, had each its own assemblage\r\nof fishes, not a single genus being common to the two basins. Such\r\ncontrasts, whether the two lakes were geologically contemporaneous,\r\nor the northern arose later than the southern, undoubtedly indicate\r\nlong-continued isolation and the gradual evolution of new forms under\r\ndifferent conditions of environment.[310]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: In my memoir \"On the Old Red Sandstone of Western\r\nEurope\" (_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. 1878), I argued for the\r\nprobable geological contemporaneity of the conglomerates, sandstones\r\nand flagstones on either side of the Grampian chain, even although\r\ntheir organic contents were so unlike. The stratigraphical evidence\r\nfavours this view. In each case a thick series of strata is covered\r\nunconformably by Upper Old Red Sandstone, containing _Holoptychius\r\nnobilissimus_ and other fishes. The question cannot perhaps be\r\ndefinitely settled by the data available in Scotland. It is quite\r\npossible that the basin on the northern side of the Grampians, which\r\nI have termed \"Lake Orcadie,\" came into existence after that on the\r\nsouthern side. But I do not think the differences in their respective\r\nfaunas are to be accounted for simply by lapse of time and the gradual\r\norganic evolution in progress over one continuous region. The more the\r\nOld Red Sandstone is studied, the more local do its various fish-faunas\r\nappear to have been. These strongly-marked diversities appear to me\r\nrather to point to prolonged isolation of the basins from each other,\r\nas stated above. Dr. Traquair has drawn attention to the remarkable\r\nfact that, even in what appears to be one continuous series of strata\r\nof no great thickness forming the Upper Old Red Sandstone of the Moray\r\nFirth basin, the fishes found about Nairn are entirely different from\r\nthose met with in the rest of the region.]\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, were the aspects of the physical geography of the\r\ntime on the further consideration of which we are now to enter. The\r\nsubterranean disturbances, so characteristic of the period, were\r\naccompanied by a display of volcanic activity more widespread, perhaps,\r\nthan any which had yet taken place in the geological history of\r\nBritain. Nevertheless, it is worthy of remark that this manifestation\r\nof underground energy did not begin with the commencement of these\r\ndisplacements of the crust. The earliest eruptions only took place\r\nafter the geography of the region had been completely changed; at least\r\nno trace of them is to be found in the earliest portions of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. After the last lingering Silurian volcanoes in the west of\r\nIreland had died out, a protracted quiescence of the subterranean fires\r\nensued. In the latest ages of Silurian time there was not in Britain,\r\nso far as at present known, a single volcanic eruption. Not until after\r\nthe inauguration of the Old Red Sandstone topography, when the lakes\r\nhad taken shape and had begun to be filled with sediment from the\r\nsurrounding hills, did a series of new volcanoes burst into activity\r\nover the northern half of Britain. Rising in the midst of the lakes\r\nin groups of separate cones, these vents poured out floods of lava,\r\ntogether with clouds of ashes and stones. Their sites, the history of\r\ntheir eruptions, and the piles of material ejected by them, can still\r\nbe ascertained, and I shall now proceed to give some account of them.\r\n\r\nThe thick mass of sedimentary material known as the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nlying between the top of the Silurian and the base of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, has been divided into two sections, which, however, are of\r\nunequal dimensions, and doubtless represent very unequal periods of\r\ntime. The older series, or Lower Old Red Sandstone, is by far the more\r\nimportant and interesting in its extent, thickness, palæontological\r\nriches, and, what specially concerns us in the present inquiry, in\r\nits volcanic records. Wherever its true base can be seen, this series\r\npasses down conformably into Upper Silurian strata. It sometimes\r\nreaches a thickness of 15,000 and even 20,000 feet. There is generally\r\na marked break between its highest visible strata and all younger\r\nformations. Even the upper division of the Old Red Sandstone rests\r\nunconformably upon the lower.[311] Such a hiatus undoubtedly points to\r\na considerable lapse of geological time, and to the advent of important\r\ngeographical changes that considerably modified the remarkable\r\ntopography of the older part of the period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xvi. (1860), p. 312. In\r\nWales no break has actually been discovered between the two divisions\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone, though it is suspected to exist there also.]\r\n\r\nThe younger division or Upper Old Red Sandstone passes upward\r\nconformably into the base of the Carboniferous system. Its red and\r\nyellow sandstones, conglomerates and breccias, covering much more\r\nrestricted areas, and attaining a much less thickness than those of\r\nthe lower division, indicate the diminution and gradual effacement of\r\nthe lakes of the older time, and the eventual return of the sea to the\r\ntracts from which it had been so long excluded. So vast an interval\r\nelapsed between the time recorded in the deposits respectively of the\r\ntwo sections of the Old Red Sandstone that the characteristic forms of\r\nanimal life in the earlier ages had entirely passed away, and their\r\nplaces had been taken by other types when the diminished lake-basins of\r\nthe second period began to be filled up. Volcanic action also dwindled\r\nto such a degree that in contrast to the abundant vents of the older\r\nperiod, only one or two widely scattered groups of vents are known to\r\nhave existed in the area of the British Isles during the later period,\r\nand these, after a feeble activity, gave way to a prolonged volcanic\r\nquiescence, which lasted until the earlier ages of the succeeding or\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\nAlthough geologists are in the habit of grouping the Old Red Sandstone\r\nand the Devonian rocks as equivalent or homotaxial formations,\r\ndeposited in distinct areas under considerably different conditions\r\nof sedimentation, the attempt to follow out the sequence of strata in\r\nDevonshire, and to trace some analogy between the Devonian succession\r\nand that of the Old Red Sandstone, presents many difficulties for\r\nwhich no obvious solution suggests itself. Into these problems it is\r\nnot needful to enter further than was done in the last chapter. We may\r\nassume that not improbably some of the eruptions now to be described\r\nwere coeval with those of Devonian time in the south-west of England,\r\nthough we may hesitate to decide which of them should be brought into\r\nparallelism.\r\n\r\nAs we trace the shore-lines of the ancient basins of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone, and walk over the shingle of their beaches, or as we\r\nexamine the silt of their deeper gulfs, and exhume the remains of\r\nthe plants that shaded their borders, and of the fishes that swarmed\r\nin their waters, we gradually learn that although the sediments\r\nwhich accumulated in some of these basins amount to many thousand\r\nfeet in thickness; yet from bottom to top they abound in evidence of\r\nshallow-water conditions of deposit. The terrestrial disturbances\r\nabove referred to continued for a vast interval, and while, as already\r\nsuggested, the floors of the basins sank, and the intervening tracts\r\nwere ridged up, as the results of one great movement of the earth's\r\ncrust, the denudation of the surface of the land contributed to the\r\nbasins such a constant influx of sediment as, on the whole, compensated\r\nfor the gradual depression of their bottoms.\r\n\r\nWe need not suppose that these movements of subsidence and upheaval\r\nwere uninterrupted and uniform. Indeed, the abundant coarse\r\nconglomerates, which play so prominent a part in the materials thrown\r\ninto the basins, suggest that at various intervals during the prolonged\r\nsedimentation subterranean disturbances were specially vigorous. But\r\nthe occurrence of strong unconformabilities among the deposits of the\r\nbasins sets this question at rest, by proving that the terrestrial\r\nmovements were so great as sometimes to break up the floor of a lake,\r\nand to place its older sediments on end, in which position they were\r\ncovered up and deeply buried by the succeeding deposits.[312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: An unconformability of this kind occurs between the\r\nsouth end of the Pentland Hills and Tinto in Lanarkshire, and another\r\nin Ayrshire.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to discover, among these evidences of great\r\nterrestrial disturbance, that eventually groups of volcanoes rose in\r\nlong lines from the waters of most of the lakes, and threw out enormous\r\nquantities of lava and ashes over tracts hundreds of square miles in\r\nextent. So vast, indeed, were these discharges, across what is now the\r\nMidland Valley of Scotland, that the portions of sheets of lava and\r\ntuff visible at the surface form some of the most conspicuous ranges\r\nof hills in that district, stretching continuously for 40 or 50 miles\r\nand reaching heights of more than 2000 feet above the sea. Exposed in\r\nhundreds of ravines and escarpments, and dissected by the waves along\r\nboth the eastern and western coasts of the country, these volcanic\r\nrecords may be studied with a fulness of detail which cannot be found\r\namong earlier Palæozoic formations.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that a series of rocks so well displayed\r\nand so full of interest, would long ere this have been fully examined\r\nand described. But they can hardly be said to have yet received, as a\r\nwhole, the attention they deserve. Without enumerating all the writers\r\nwho, each in his own measure, have added to the sum of our knowledge of\r\nthe subject, I may refer to the labours of Jameson,[313] Macknight[314]\r\nand Fleming,[315] among the observers who began the investigation.\r\nBut of the early pioneers, by far the most important in regard to the\r\nigneous rocks of the Old Red Sandstone was Ami Boué. While attending\r\nthe University of Edinburgh, where he took the degree of M.D. in the\r\nyear 1816, he imbibed from Jameson a love of mineralogy and geognosy,\r\nand for several years spent his leisure time in personally visiting\r\nmany parts of Scotland, in order to study the geological structure of\r\nthe country. Probably in 1820 he published in French his now classic\r\n_Essai_.[316] The value of this work as an original contribution to\r\nthe geology of the British Isles has probably never been adequately\r\nacknowledged. For this want of due recognition the author himself\r\nwas no doubt in some measure to blame. He refers distinctly enough\r\nto various previous writers, notably to Jameson and Macculloch, but\r\nhe mingles the results of his own personal examinations with theirs\r\nin such a way that it is hardly possible to ascertain what portions\r\nare the outcome of his own original observations. Less credit has\r\naccordingly been given to him than he could fairly have claimed for\r\nsolid additions to the subjects of which he treated. In the later years\r\nof his life I had opportunities of learning personally from him how\r\nextensive had been his early peregrinations in Scotland, and how vivid\r\nwere the recollections which, after the lapse of half a century, he\r\nstill retained of them. Judged simply as a well-ordered summary of all\r\nthe known facts regarding the geology of Scotland, his _Essai_ must be\r\nregarded as a work of very great value. Especially important is his\r\narrangement of the volcanic phenomena of the country, which stands far\r\nin advance of anything of the kind previously attempted. Under the head\r\nof the \"Terrain Volcanique,\" he treats of the basaltic formations,\r\ndistinguishing them as sheets (_nappes_, _coulées_) and dykes; and\r\nof the felspathic or trachytic formations, which he subdivides into\r\nphonolites, trachytes, porphyries (forming mountains and also sheets)\r\nand felspathic or trachytic dykes. In the details supplied under each\r\nof these sections he gives facts and deductions which were obviously\r\nthe result of his own independent examination of the ground, and he\r\nlikewise marshals the data accumulated by Jameson, Macculloch and\r\nothers, in such a way as to present a more comprehensive and definite\r\npicture of the volcanic phenomena of Scotland than any previous writer\r\nhad ventured to give.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: _Memoirs of the Wernerian Society_, vol. ii.

His later lectures became more valuable\r\nbut were never published, save indirectly in so far as they influenced\r\nthe opinions of his pupils who published writings on the same subjects.\r\nSee, for instance, Hay Cunningham's _Geology of the Lothians_, p. 59,\r\nfootnote. Compare an article on Boué, _Edinburgh Review_ for May 1823\r\n(vol. xxxviii. p. 413).]\r\n\r\nThe account which Boué wrote of the Old Red Sandstone and its\r\nassociated igneous rocks marked the first great forward step in the\r\ninvestigation of this section of the geological record. He was the\r\nearliest observer to divide what he calls the \"roches feldspathiques\r\net trappéennes\" into groups according to their geological position and\r\nmineralogical character, and to regard them as of igneous origin and of\r\nthe age, or nearly of the age, of the red sandstone of Central Scotland.\r\n\r\nOf later writers who have treated of the volcanic rocks of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, my old friend Charles Maclaren deserves special recognition.\r\nHis survey and description of the Pentland Hills embodied the first\r\ndetailed and accurate investigation of any portion of these rocks,\r\nand his _Geology of Fife and the Lothians_ may still be read with\r\npleasure and instruction.[317] Boué had indicated roughly on the little\r\nsketch-map accompanying his _Essai_ the chief bands of his felspathic\r\nand trappean rocks of the Old Red Sandstone, but their position and\r\nlimits were more precisely defined in Macculloch's \"Geological Map of\r\nScotland,\" which was published in 1840, five years after the sudden\r\nand tragic death of its author. The observers who have more recently\r\nstudied these rocks have been chiefly members of the Geological Survey,\r\nand to some of the more important results obtained by them I shall\r\nrefer in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: _Geology of Fife and the Lothians_, 1839. More detailed\r\nreference will be made in later pages to this classic.]\r\n\r\nFor many years I have devoted much time to the investigation of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone and its volcanic rocks. In the year 1859 I ascertained\r\nthe existence of the great hiatus between the Lower and Upper divisions\r\nof the system.[318] A first sketch of the volcanic history of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone was given by me in 1861,[319] which was subsequently\r\nenlarged and filled in with more detail in 1879.[320] But it was not\r\nuntil 1892 that I published a somewhat detailed outline of the whole\r\nsubject, tracing the history of volcanic action during the period of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, the distribution of the volcanoes, and the\r\ncharacter of the materials erupted by them.[321] This outline I now\r\nproceed to amplify, filling in details that were necessarily omitted\r\nbefore, though there are still several districts regarding which\r\ninformation is scanty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: \"On the Old Red Sandstone of the South of Scotland,\"\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xvi. (1860), p. 312.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: \"On the Chronology of the Trap-Rocks of Scotland,\"\r\n_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxii. (1861), p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: Article \"Geology,\" in Ninth Edition of the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_, vol. x. (1879), p. 343. Reprinted in my _Text-Book of\r\nGeology_, of which the first edition appeared in 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: \"Presidential Address to the Geological Society,\"\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlviii. (1892).]\r\n\r\nIn arranging the treatment of the subject I shall divide the record\r\ninto two main sections, the first and much the more important being\r\ndevoted to the Lower and the second to the Upper Old Red Sandstone.\r\nIn the first of these divisions it will be convenient to begin by\r\ntaking note of the distribution of the various districts over which\r\nthe geological evidence is spread. We may then proceed to consider the\r\ngeneral character of the volcanic rocks and the manner in which they\r\nare arranged in the stratigraphy of the country, taking in consecutive\r\norder (1) the superficial lavas and tuffs; (2) the vents; (3) the\r\ndykes and sills. From these general considerations we may pass to the\r\ndetailed history of events in each of the separate volcanic areas, and\r\nthus obtain, as far as the evidence at present permits, a broad view of\r\nthe progress of volcanic action during the time of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE VOLCANIC CENTRES IN THE LOWER OLD RED\r\nSANDSTONE--CHARACTERS OF THE MATERIALS ERUPTED BY THE VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\ni. DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANIC CENTRES\r\n\r\nThe area within which volcanic rocks belonging to the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone appear is one of the most extensive regions over which the\r\nvolcanic eruptions of any geological period can be traced in the\r\nBritish Isles (Map I.). Its northern limit reaches as far as the\r\nislet of Uya in Shetland, and its southern appears in England in the\r\nCheviot Hills--a distance of about 250 miles. But volcanic rocks of\r\nprobably corresponding age occur even as far to the south as the hills\r\nnear Killarney. The most easterly margin of this area is defined by\r\nthe North Sea on the coast of Berwickshire, and its extreme western\r\nboundary extends to near Lough Erne in the north of Ireland--a distance\r\nof some 230 miles. If we include the post-Silurian bosses and dykes,\r\nlike those of Shap, and likewise the Devonian volcanic rocks of Devon\r\nand Cornwall, as contemporaneous with those of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nthe area of eruption will be greatly enlarged. But leaving these out\r\nof account for the present, and confining our attention to the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone series, we find that, within the wide limits over\r\nwhich the volcanic rocks are distributed, a number of distinct and\r\noften widely separated centres of eruption may be traced. Taking\r\nthese as they lie from north to south, we may specially enumerate the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. The Shetland and Orkney Islands, together with the basin of the\r\nMoray Firth. This region includes several distinct volcanic groups,\r\nof which the most northerly extends through the centre to the\r\nnorth-western headlands of the mainland of Shetland, another lies in\r\nthe island of Shapinshay, one of the Orkneys, while at least two can be\r\nrecognized on the south side of the Moray Firth. To this wide region\r\nof Old Red Sandstone I have given the general designation of \"Lake\r\nOrcadie.\"[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. (1878), p. 354.]\r\n\r\n2. The basin of Lorne, on the west of the mainland of Argyllshire,\r\nextending from Loch Creran to Loch Melfort and the hills on the west\r\nside of Loch Awe.\r\n\r\n3. The great central basin of Scotland, which, for the sake of\r\ndistinctness, I have called \"Lake Caledonia,\"[323] stretching\r\nbetween the Highlands and the Southern Uplands, from the east coast\r\nsouth-westwards across Arran and the south end of Cantire into Ireland\r\nas far as Lough Erne. Numerous distinct volcanic groups occur in this\r\ngreat basin, and their volcanic history will be discussed in detail in\r\nlater chapters (see Map III.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\n4. The basin of the Cheviot Hills and Berwickshire, with these hills as\r\nthe chief area, but including also other tracts, probably independent,\r\nwhich are cut off by the sea along the eastern coast of Berwickshire\r\nbetween St. Abb's Head and Eyemouth.\r\n\r\n5. The Killarney tract, including the hills lying around Lough Guitane\r\nin the east of County Kerry.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we may take note of a feature in the volcanic history of\r\nBritain, first prominently noticeable in the records of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and becoming increasingly distinct during the rest of the\r\nlong sequence of Palæozoic eruptions, namely, the persistence with\r\nwhich the vents have been opened in the valleys and have avoided the\r\nhigh grounds. I formerly dwelt on this relation, with reference to\r\nthe Carboniferous volcanic phenomena,[324] but the observation may\r\nbe greatly extended. With regard to the Old Red Sandstone of Central\r\nScotland, though the lavas and tuffs that were discharged over the\r\nfloor of the sheet of water which occupied that region gradually rose\r\nalong the flanks of the northern and southern hills, yet it was on the\r\nlake-bottom and not among the hills that the orifices of eruption broke\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxix. (1879), p. 454.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no undoubted vents of the age of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone have been detected among the high grounds of the\r\nHighlands on the one hand, or among the Silurian uplands on the other,\r\nalthough a fringe of the lavas may be traced here and there along the\r\nbase of the hills.[325] In some cases, doubtless, the position of the\r\nvalleys may have been determined by lines of fault that might well\r\nserve as lines of relief along which volcanic vents would be opened.\r\nBut in many instances it can be proved that, though the vents have\r\nrisen in valleys and low grounds, they have not selected lines of fault\r\nvisible at the surface, even when these existed in their neighbourhood.\r\nAny fissures up which the volcanic ejections made their way must have\r\nlain at great depths beneath the formations that now form the surface\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: Certain remarkable necks of breccia have been detected\r\nby Mr. J. R. Dakyns rising through the schists at the upper end of\r\nLoch Lomond; but there is not sufficient evidence to connect them\r\nwith the volcanic series of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. Some of the\r\nyounger granite bosses are not improbably to be referred to this\r\nvolcanic series. The latest granites of the eastern Grampians, as\r\nalready stated, have lately been found by Mr. Barrow cutting the\r\nband of probably Lower Silurian strata along the southern border of\r\nthe Highlands. Those of Galloway are younger than the Upper Silurian\r\nformations, which they invade, and older than the conglomerates of the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone, which contain pebbles of them. These eruptive\r\nbosses will be further discussed in the sequel.]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. CHARACTERS OF THE MATERIALS ERUPTED BY THE VOLCANOES\r\n\r\nA general summary of the petrographical characters of the igneous rocks\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone may here find a place. Further details\r\nwill be given in the account of \"Lake Caledonia,\" which is the typical\r\narea for them; but, on the whole, the prevailing types in one region\r\nare found to be repeated in the others.\r\n\r\n1. _Bedded Lavas._--Beginning with the lavas which were poured out\r\nat the surface, we have to notice a considerable range of chemical\r\ncomposition among them, although, as a rule, they are characterized\r\nby general similarity of external appearance. At the one end, come\r\ndiabases and other ancient forms of basalt or dolerite, wherein the\r\nsilica percentage is below or little above 50. By far the largest\r\nproportion of the lavas, however, are porphyrites or altered andesites,\r\nhaving about 60 per cent of silica. With these are associated lavas\r\ncontaining more or less unstriped felspar and a somewhat higher\r\nproportion of silica, which may be grouped as trachytes, though no very\r\nsharp line can be drawn between them and the andesites. In the Pentland\r\nHills, and some other areas, orthophyres flowed out alternately with\r\nthe more basic lavas, and were associated with felsitic tuffs and\r\nbreccias.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the lava-sheets of the Lower Old Red Sandstone,\r\nif we consider the character of the prevalent type, hold an\r\nintermediate grade between the average chemical composition of those\r\nof Silurian and of those of later Carboniferous time. On the one hand,\r\nthey rarely assume the character of thoroughly acid rocks, like the\r\nnodular rhyolites of the Bala and Upper Silurian series;[326] on the\r\nother hand, they seldom include such basic lavas as the basalts, so\r\ncommon among the puy-eruptions of the Carboniferous system, and never,\r\nso far as I know, contain varieties comparable to the \"ultra-basic\"\r\ncompounds which I shall have occasion to allude to as characteristic of\r\na particular volcanic zone in that system.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: The only examples known to me are those of Benaun More\r\nand other hills in County Kerry.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Diabase-lavas are typically developed in the chain of the\r\nPentland Hills, where they form long bands intercalated between\r\nfelsitic tuffs--a remarkable association, to which I shall make more\r\ndetailed reference in a later chapter. They range in texture from a\r\ncompact dark greenish base to a dull earthy amygdaloid. One of their\r\nmost remarkable varieties is a fine-grained green porphyry, with\r\nlarge flat tabular crystals of plagioclase arranged parallel to the\r\ndirection of flow (Carnethy Hill). Most of them, however, are more\r\nor less amygdaloidal, and some of them (Warklaw Hill) strongly so.\r\nThe following analyses, made in the laboratory of the Royal School of\r\nMines under the direction of Prof. E. Frankland, show the chemical\r\ncomposition of some of the diabases of the Pentland Hills:[327]--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: For analyses of some Shetland diabases of Old Red\r\nSandstone age, see Mr. R.

The\r\nprevailing type presents a close-grained, rather dull texture, and a\r\ncolour varying from pinkish grey, through many shades of green and\r\nbrown, to purplish red, which last is, on the whole, the predominant\r\nhue. Minute lath-shaped felspars may frequently be detected with the\r\nnaked eye on fresh surfaces, while scattered crystals, which are\r\ngenerally hæmatitic pseudomorphs after some pyroxene, occasionally\r\nafter hornblende or mica, may often be observed. The usual porphyritic\r\nconstituents are plagioclase felspars, occasionally in abundant\r\ntabular crystals measuring half an inch or more across, also one or\r\nmore pyroxenes (augite, enstatite), and sometimes brown or black mica.\r\nWhere large felspar-crystals occur in a compact green matrix, the rock\r\nassumes a resemblance to the _verde antique_ of the ancients.[329]\r\nOne of the Cheviot andesites lying at the bottom of the series is\r\ndistinguished by its large and abundant plates of black mica.[330]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: An instance of this rock occurs in Kincardineshire, from\r\nwhich the large flat twins of labradorite have been analyzed by Dr.\r\nHeddle (_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. (1879), p. 257).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: C. T. Clough, \"The Cheviot Hills,\" _Mem. Geol. Survey_\r\n(1888), p. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe texture of the andesites occasionally becomes faintly resinous,\r\nwhere a considerable proportion of glass still remains undevitrified,\r\nas in the well-known varieties from the Cheviot Hills, and in another\r\npitchstone-like rock from above Airthrey Castle in the Ochil Hills,\r\nnear Bridge of Allan. It sometimes presents a nodular or coarsely\r\nperlitic character, weathering out in nut-like balls, like the rock\r\nof Buckham's Wall Burn in the Cheviot Hills.[331] Much more frequent\r\nis a well-developed amygdaloidal structure, which indeed may be said\r\nto be the most obvious characteristic of these rocks as a whole. The\r\nsteam-vesicles, now filled with agate, quartz, calcite or zeolite, vary\r\nin size from mere granules up to large irregular cavities a foot or\r\nmore in diameter. Where the kernels are coated with pale-green earth\r\nand lie in a dark brown matrix, they give rise to some of the most\r\nbeautiful varieties of rock in any volcanic series in this country,\r\nas may be seen on the Ayrshire coast at Culzean and Turnberry. Some\r\nrocks contain the vesicles only as rare individuals, others have them\r\nso crowded together as to form the greater part of the cubic contents\r\nof the mass. When the infiltration-products have weathered out, some of\r\nthe amygdaloids present a striking resemblance to recent slaggy brown\r\nlavas; lumps of them must have been originally light enough to float in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: _Ibid._ p. 11.]\r\n\r\nMy colleague in the Geological Survey, Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson, some\r\nyears ago made for me a large series of determinations of the specific\r\ngravity of the volcanic rocks of the Lower Old Red Sandstone of\r\nScotland. He found that the andesites collected from various districts\r\nto illustrate the more typical varieties of rock averaged about 2·66.\r\nHe also made a series of chemical analyses of a number of the same\r\nrocks from the Cheviot Hills, where they are well preserved.

Much, however, still remains to\r\nbe done before our knowledge of this branch of British petrography\r\ncan be regarded as adequate. The groundmass in some of the rocks\r\nconsists mainly of a brown glass with a streaky structure (as in\r\nthe well-known variety of Kirk Yetholm, and in the rock, still more\r\nlike pitchstone, from near Airthrey Castle in the Ochil chain);\r\nmore usually it has been devitrified more or less completely by the\r\nappearance of felspathic microlites, until it presents a confused\r\nfelspar aggregate. The porphyritic felspars are often large, generally\r\nstriped, but sometimes including crystals that show no striping.\r\nThey are frequently found to be full of inclusions of the base, and\r\nthese sometimes consist of glass. The ferro-magnesian constituents\r\nare usually rather decomposed, being now represented by chloritic\r\npseudomorphs; but augite, and perhaps still more frequently enstatite,\r\nmay be recognized, or its presence may be inferred among them. The\r\nbeautiful resinous or pitchstone-like rock from near Airthrey Castle\r\nhas been found by Mr. Watts to be a glassy hypersthene-augite-andesite,\r\nsince among its phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and hypersthene both\r\noccur. Magnetite is commonly traceable, and apatite may be occasionally\r\ndetected. As the result of decomposition, calcite, chlorite and\r\nlimonite are very generally diffused through the rocks.[335]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: _Geol. Mag. for 1883_, pp. 100, 145, 252.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: _Mikroskopische und chemische Untersuchungen am\r\nEnstatit-porphyrit aus den Cheviot Hills_, Inaug. Dissert. Kiel, 1884.\r\nDescriptions have also been published of detached rocks from other\r\ndistricts, such as those by Prof. Judd and Mr. Durham of specimens from\r\nthe Eastern Ochils, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlii. (1886), p.\r\n418.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: Dr. F. H. Hatch supplied notes on microscopic structure\r\nwhich are incorporated in the text, together with particulars\r\nafterwards furnished by Mr. Watts.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) The lavas which may be separated as Trachytes offer no\r\ndistinctive features externally by which they may be distinguished from\r\nthe andesites. Indeed, both groups of rocks appear to be connected by\r\nintermediate varieties. In the Cheviot Hills some of the lavas are\r\nfound, on microscopic examination, to contain a large admixture of\r\nunstriped porphyritic felspars, which can occasionally be recognized\r\nas sanidine in Carlsbad twins. The groundmass is sometimes a brown\r\nglass, but is usually more or less completely devitrified, portions of\r\nit being inclosed in the large felspars. Chlorite, pseudomorphic after\r\naugite or enstatite, may be detected, and sometimes a brown mica. A\r\nspecimen of one of these rocks, from a locality to the north-west of\r\nWhitton, near Jedburgh, was found by Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson to have the\r\nfollowing composition:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+\r\n  | N.W. of Whitton Hill, |\r\n  |  Jedburgh (No. 1938)  |\r\n  |     Sp. gr. 2·55.     |\r\n  +-------------+---------+\r\n  | SiO_{2}     |  62·44  |\r\n  | Al_{2}O_{3} |  18·99  |\r\n  | Fe_{2}O_{3} |   3·35  |\r\n  | FeO         |    1·8  |\r\n  | MnO         |     ·25 |\r\n  | CaO         |    1·84 |\r\n  | MgO         |    1·37 |\r\n  | K_{2}O      |    5·02 |\r\n  | Na_{2}O     |    2·65 |\r\n  | H_{2}O      |    2·48 |\r\n  +-------------+---------+\r\n  | Total.      |  100·19 |\r\n  +-------------+---------+\r\n\r\n(_d_) Acid rocks such as Felsites and Rhyolites are rare among the\r\nlavas poured out at the surface during the time of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. They occur in the Pentland Hills, also near Dolphinton\r\nin the Biggar district, and in the Ochil Hills near Auchterarder,\r\nassociated with extensive accumulations of felsitic tuffs and breccias.\r\nThey are usually so much decomposed that it is hardly possible to\r\nprocure fresh specimens of them. Some of them display beautiful\r\nflow-structure. They appear to be generally orthoclase-felsites or\r\northophyres. Dull, fine-grained to flinty in texture, they hardly\r\never display free quartz, so that they can seldom be placed among the\r\ntypical rhyolites, though in their banded flow-structure they often\r\nstrongly resemble some lithoid varieties of these rocks, especially\r\nsuch varieties as that represented in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts, to whom I submitted, for microscopic examination, a number\r\nof specimens from the Pentland and Ochil Hills, has found them to\r\n\"consist of a brown felsitic groundmass in which are embedded a\r\ngeneration of small stumpy prisms of orthoclase and a set of larger\r\nphenocrysts, generally consisting of orthoclase and plagioclase in\r\nequal proportions. Brown mica is usually present and zircons are not\r\nuncommon.\" The rocks, when they undergo weathering, pass into the\r\nvarieties formerly comprised under the name claystone.\r\n\r\nThe only nodular felsite of this age which I have met with is that\r\nof Lough Guitane among the \"Dingle Beds,\" near Killarney, to which\r\nreference will be made in later pages.\r\n\r\n2. _Intrusive Bosses, Sills and Dykes._--While the interbedded\r\nlava-sheets are mainly andesites, the intrusive rocks are generally\r\nmore acid, and most of them may be grouped under the convenient head\r\nof felsites. Some intrusive andesites, and even more basic rocks, do\r\nindeed occur in dykes and sills, as well as also filling vents. But\r\nthe rule remains of general application over the whole country that\r\nthe materials which have consolidated in the volcanic orifices of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, or have been thrust among the rocks in dykes,\r\nbosses or sills, are decidedly acid. In this series of rocks a greater\r\nrange of types may be traced than among the extrusive lavas. At the\r\none end we find true granites or granitites, as in the intrusive\r\nbosses of Spango Water and of Galloway, which, for reasons which I\r\nwill afterwards adduce, may with some probability be assigned to the\r\nvolcanic history of the Lower Old Red Sandstone period. Among the\r\nbosses, many of which probably mark the positions of eruptive vents,\r\northophyres are especially prominent. These rocks frequently contain\r\nno mica, but, on the other hand, they sometimes show abundant quartz\r\nin their groundmass. The augite-granitite of the Cheviot Hills, so\r\nwell described by Mr. Teall, has invaded the bedded andesites of that\r\nregion.[336] A similar rock has been noticed by my brother, Prof. James\r\nGeikie, associated with the Lower Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks of\r\nthe east of Ayrshire. A remarkable petrographical variety has been\r\nmapped by Mr. B. N. Peach, rising as a small boss through the lower\r\npart of the great lava-sheets of the Ochil Hills, above Tillicoultry.\r\nIt is a granophyric quartz-diorite, which, under the microscope, is\r\nseen to be composed of short, thick-set prisms of plagioclase, with\r\nabundant granophyric quartz, a pleochroic hypersthene, and needles\r\nof apatite. Sometimes the pyroxene is replaced by green chloritic\r\npseudomorphs.[337]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: _Geol. Mag._ for 1883, pp. 100, 145, 252; and _British\r\nPetrography_, pp. 272, 278.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: Notes by Dr. Hatch.]\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the series come the felsites, quartz-porphyries,\r\nmica-porphyrites, minettes, vogesites, \"hornstones\" and \"claystones\"\r\n(or decayed felsites), which have a close-grained texture, often with\r\nporphyritic felspars, quartz or black mica, generally a whitish, pale\r\nbuff, orange, pink or purplish-grey colour, and a specific gravity of\r\nabout 2·55.[338]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: The intrusive \"porphyry\" of Lintrathen in Forfarshire\r\n(which may be younger than the Old Red Sandstone) is a bright red rock\r\nwith porphyritic felspar, quartz, white mica and a very singular black\r\nmica (Mr. Teall's _British Petrography_, p. 286).]\r\n\r\nThough I class these rocks as intrusive, I am not prepared to assert\r\nthat in none of the instances where they occur as sheets may they\r\npossibly have been erupted at the surface as lavas. In one or two cases\r\nthe evidence either way is doubtful, but as the great majority of the\r\nacid rocks can be shown to be intrusive in their behaviour, I have\r\npreferred to keep them all in the same category. I am prepared to find,\r\nhowever, that, as so vast an amount of felsitic debris was ejected to\r\nform the tuffs, more of this material may have flowed out in streams of\r\nlava than is at present recognized.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the chemical composition of some acid sills\r\nand dykes from the Lower Old Red Sandstone, as determined in the\r\nlaboratory of Prof. E. Frankland:[339]--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: Two analyses of rhyolites from Shetland by Mr. Tatlock\r\nwill be found in _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxii. (1887), p.\r\n387.

Dr. Hatch, as the result of his examination of a number of\r\nmicroscopic slides prepared from specimens taken by me from various\r\nparts of the hill, found some to be minettes, showing small isolated\r\ncrystals of orthoclase and rare flakes of biotite, sometimes granules\r\nof quartz, imbedded in a brown, finely microlitic groundmass of felspar\r\npowdered over with calcite; while other specimens had a granular\r\ninstead of a microlitic groundmass, and contained a considerable amount\r\nof quartz in addition to the constituents just mentioned. A conspicuous\r\nknob on the south side of Tinto, called the Pap Craig, is a mass of\r\naugite-diorite, which has risen through the other rocks[341] (see Fig.\r\n93). The sills in the same region show still further differences. Some\r\nare true \"felspar-porphyries,\" and \"quartz-porphyries\" varying in the\r\nrelative abundance and size of their porphyritic orthoclase and quartz,\r\nwhile others, by the introduction of hornblende or pseudomorphs after\r\nthat mineral, pass into vogesites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: This rock differs considerably from the other intrusive\r\nmasses in its neighbourhood. Dr. Hatch found it to be composed chiefly\r\nof lath-shaped striped felspar, with some granular augite, magnetite\r\nand interstitial quartz.]\r\n\r\nBasic sills and bosses are chiefly developed among the Ochil and\r\nSidlaw Hills. They may generally be classed as diabases. But sometimes\r\ntheir pyroxenic constituent is partly hypersthene, as in a coarsely\r\ncrystalline boss about a mile south of Dunning, which has been\r\ndetermined by Mr. Watts to \"consist of augite and hypersthene imbedded\r\nin and occurring amongst large plagioclase prisms. Some iron-ore is\r\nalso present; the rock is a hyperite.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Tuffs and Agglomerates._--The fragmental materials, ejected from\r\nor filling up the vents, vary from the finest compacted dust up to\r\nsome of the coarsest agglomerates in this country. In general they\r\nconsist mainly of detritus of andesite, and have been derived from the\r\nblowing up of already consolidated masses of that rock. The fragments\r\nare usually angular, and range from minute grains up to blocks as large\r\nas a cottage. The tuffs are often more or less mixed with ordinary\r\nnon-volcanic sediment, and as they are traced away from the centres of\r\neruption they pass insensibly into sandstones and conglomerates.\r\n\r\nBut while, as might be expected, the tuffs are most commonly made\r\nup of debris of the same kind of lavas as those that usually form\r\nthe sheets which were poured out at the surface, they include also\r\nbands of material derived from the destruction of much more acid\r\nrocks. Throughout the chain of the Ochil Hills, for example, in the\r\nmidst of the bedded andesite-lavas, many of the thin courses of fine\r\ntuff consist largely of felsitic fragments, with scattered felspar\r\ncrystals. The most remarkable examples of this nature, however, are to\r\nbe met with at the great vent of the Braid Hills, in the chain of the\r\nPentland Hills which runs south-westward from it, and in the Biggar\r\nvolcanic district still further south. These acid tuffs are generally\r\npale flesh-coloured or lilac in tint, and compact in texture, but,\r\nlike the felsitic lavas from which they were derived, they are apt\r\nto weather into yellow or buff \"claystones.\" The finer varieties are\r\nso compact as to present to the naked eye no distinguishable grains;\r\nthey might be mistaken for felsites, and indeed, except where they\r\ncontain recognizable fragments of rock or broken crystals of felspar,\r\ncan hardly be discriminated from them. They consist of an exceedingly\r\nfine compacted felsitic dust. Here and there, however, the scattered\r\ncrystals of felspar and small angular fragments of felsite, which may\r\nbe detected in them, increase in number until they form the whole of\r\nthe rock, which is then a brecciated tuff or fine volcanic breccia,\r\nmade up of different felsites, among which, even with the naked eye,\r\ndelicate flow-structures may be detected. In these pale acid tuffs,\r\nfragments of different andesites may often be observed, which increase\r\nin number as the rocks are traced away from the main vents of eruption.\r\n\r\nAt my request my colleague, Mr. George Barrow, determined the silica\r\npercentages in a few specimens which I selected as showing some of\r\nthe more characteristic varieties of these tuffs from the Braid and\r\nPentland Hills. His results are exhibited in the following table:--\r\n\r\n                                                                Silica\r\n                                                              percentage.\r\n\r\n  1. Quarry above Woodhouselee                                    63·3\r\n  2. South-west side of Castlelaw Hill                            73·15\r\n  3. Quarry on road, ½ mile N.E. of Swanston (Braid Hill vent)    74·1\r\n  4. South-west side of Castlelaw Hill                            75·0\r\n  5.

South side of White Hill Plantation                          90·00\r\n\r\nFrom these analyses it may be inferred that the average amount of\r\nsilica in the more typical varieties is between 70 and 75 per cent.\r\nThe last specimen in the table, with its abnormally high percentage\r\nof acid, must be regarded as an exceptional variety, where there has\r\neither been an excessive removal of some of the bases, or where silica\r\nhas been added by infiltration.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic examination of these rocks has not added much to\r\nthe information derivable from a study of them in the field. In\r\ntheir most close-grained varieties, as above remarked, they are\r\nhardly to be distinguished from felsites. But they generally show\r\ntraces of the minute detrital particles of felsite of which they are\r\nessentially composed. The brecciated varieties exhibit finely-streaked\r\nflow-structure in some of the fragments. Pieces of andesite, grains of\r\nquartz, and other extraneous ingredients appear in these rocks towards\r\nthe southern limits of the volcanic area of the Pentland Hills, where\r\nthe acid tuffs are associated with and pass laterally and vertically\r\ninto ordinary non-volcanic sedimentary strata. Further details as to\r\nthe part which these tuffs play in the volcanic history of the regions\r\nwherein they occur will be given in later pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE LOWER OLD RED SANDSTONE VOLCANIC ROCKS\r\nIN THE FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the manner in which the various volcanic\r\nproducts have been grouped around and within the orifices of discharge.\r\nThe first feature to arrest the eye of a trained geologist who\r\napproaches them as they are displayed in one of the ranges of hills in\r\nCentral Scotland is the bedded aspect of the rocks. If, for example,\r\nhe looks eastward from the head of the Firth of Tay, he marks on the\r\nright hand, running for many miles through the county of Fife, a\r\nsuccession of parallel escarpments, of which the steep fronts face\r\nnorthwards, while their long dip-slopes descend towards the south. On\r\nhis left hand a similar but higher series of escarpments, stretching\r\nfar eastwards into Forfarshire, through the chain of the Sidlaw Hills,\r\nrepeats the same features, but in opposite directions. If he stands on\r\nthe alluvial plain of the Forth, near Stirling, and looks towards the\r\nnorth, he can trace bar after bar of brown rock and grassy slope rising\r\nfrom base to summit of the western end of the Ochil Hills. If, again,\r\nfrom any height on the southern outskirts of the city of Edinburgh,\r\nhe lets his eye range along the north-western front of the chain of\r\nthe Pentland Hills, especially towards evening, he can follow the same\r\nparallel banding as a conspicuous feature on each successive hill that\r\nmounts above the plain. Or if, as he traverses the west of Argyllshire,\r\nhe comes in sight of the uplands of Lorne, he at once recognizes the\r\nterraced contours of the hills between Loch Awe and the western sea,\r\npresenting so strange a contrast to the rugged and irregular outlines\r\nof the more ancient schist and granite mountains all around (see Fig.\r\n99).\r\n\r\n\r\ni. BEDDED LAVAS AND TUFFS\r\n\r\nOn a nearer inspection, the dominant topographical features are found\r\nto correspond with a well-marked stratification of the whole volcanic\r\nseries. Where two sheets of andesite are separated by layers of tuff,\r\nsandstone or conglomerate, a well-marked hollow will often be found to\r\nindicate the junction-line; but even where the lavas follow each other\r\nwithout such interstratifications, their differences of texture and\r\nconsequent variations in mode and amount of weathering usually suffice\r\nto mark them off from each other, and to indicate their trend along the\r\nsurface in successive terraces. Even where the angles of inclination\r\nare high, the bedded arrangement can generally be detected.\r\n\r\nIt is in the picturesque and instructive coast-sections, however, that\r\nthe details of this bedded structure are most clearly displayed. On\r\nboth sides of the country, along the shores of Ayrshire on the west,\r\nand those of Kincardineshire and Forfarshire on the east, the volcanic\r\ngroup has been admirably dissected by the waves. The lava-beds have\r\nbeen cut in vertical section, so that their structure and their mode\r\nof superposition, one over another, can be conveniently studied, while\r\nat the same time, the upper surfaces of many of the flows have been\r\nonce more laid bare as they existed before they were buried under the\r\nsedimentary accumulations of the waters in which they were erupted.\r\n\r\nThough distinctly bedded, the Lavas show little of the regularity and\r\npersistence so characteristic of those of Carboniferous and of Tertiary\r\ntime. Some of them are not more than from four to ten feet thick, and\r\ngenerally, on the coast-cliffs, they appear to be less than fifty feet.\r\nA continuous group of sheets can sometimes be traced for ten miles or\r\nmore from the probable vent of discharge.\r\n\r\nThat many of these lavas were erupted in a markedly pasty condition\r\nmay be inferred from certain of their more prominent characteristics.\r\nSometimes, indeed, they appear as tolerably dense homogeneous masses,\r\nbreaking with a kind of prismatic jointing; but more frequently they\r\nare strongly amygdaloidal, and sometimes so much so that, as already\r\nstated, the amygdales form the larger proportion of their bulk. Where\r\nthe secondary infiltration-products have weathered out, the rough\r\nscoriform rock looks as if it might only recently have been erupted.\r\nIn a few instances I have observed an undulating rope-like surface,\r\nwhich reminded me of well-known Vesuvian lavas. Usually the top and\r\nbottom of each sheet assume a strikingly slaggy aspect, which here and\r\nthere is exaggerated to such an extent that between the more solid and\r\nhomogeneous parts of two consecutive flows an intermediate band occurs,\r\nten or twelve feet thick, made up of clinker-like lumps of slag, the\r\ninterspaces being filled in with hardened sand. In some cases these\r\nagglomeratic layers may actually consist in part of ejected blocks; but\r\nthe way in which many of the lavas have cooled in rugged scoriaceous\r\nsurfaces is as conspicuous as on any modern _coulée_. The loosened\r\nslags, or the broken-up cakes and blocks of lava, have sometimes been\r\ncaught up in the still moving, pasty current, which has congealed with\r\nits vesicles drawn out round the enclosed fragments, giving rise to a\r\nmass that might be taken for a breccia or agglomerate. Now and then\r\nwe may observe that the upper slaggy portion of a sheet has assumed\r\na bright red colour from the oxidation of its ferruginous minerals;\r\nand from the contrast it thus presents to the rest of the rock we\r\nmay perhaps legitimately infer that the disintegration took place\r\nbefore the outflow of the next succeeding lava. If this inference\r\nbe well founded, and it is confirmed by other evidence which will be\r\nsubsequently adduced, it points to the probable lapse of considerable\r\nintervals of time between some of the outflows of lava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 65.--Veins and nests of sandstone due to the washing of\r\n     sand into fissures and cavities of an Old Red Sandstone lava.\r\n     Turnberry Point, Ayrshire.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most singular structure displayed by these lavas is\r\nto be seen in the manner in which they are traversed by and enclose\r\nportions of sandstone. Since I originally observed this feature on\r\nthe Ayrshire coast, near Turnberry Point, many years ago,[342] I have\r\nrepeatedly met with it in the various volcanic districts of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone across the whole of the Midland Valley of Scotland.\r\nThe first and natural inference which a cursory examination of it\r\nsuggests is that the molten rock has caught up and carried along pieces\r\nof already consolidated sandstone. But a little further observation\r\nwill show that the lines of stratification in the sandstone, even\r\nin what appear to be detached fragments, are marked by a general\r\nparallelism, and lie in the same general plane with the surface of the\r\nbed of lava in which the sandy material is enclosed. In a vertical\r\nsection the sandstone is seen to occur sometimes in narrow dykes\r\nwith even, parallel walls, but more usually in irregular twisting\r\nand branching veins, or even in lumps which, though probably once\r\nconnected with some of these veins, now appear as if entirely detached\r\nfrom them (Fig. 65). Frequently, indeed, the nodular slaggy andesite\r\nand the sandstone are so mixed up that the observer may hesitate\r\nwhether to describe the mass as a sandstone enclosing balls and blocks\r\nof lava, or as a scoriaceous lava permeated with hardened sand. A\r\nclose connection may be traced between these sandstone-inclosures and\r\nthe beds of sandstone interstratified between the successive lavas.\r\nWe can follow the sandy material downwards from these intercalated\r\nbeds into the andesites below them. On exposed upper surfaces of the\r\nlava, an intricate reticulation of sandstone veins may be noticed,\r\nin each of which the stratification of the material runs across the\r\nveins, showing sometimes distinct current-bedding, but maintaining\r\na general parallelism with the bedding of the volcanic sheets and\r\ntheir fragmentary accompaniments (Fig. 66). If we could remove the\r\nsandstone-veinings and aggregates, we should find the upper surfaces\r\nof these igneous masses to present a singularly fissured and slaggy\r\nappearance, reminding us of the rugged, rent and clinker-loaded slopes\r\nof a modern viscous lava, like some of those in the Atrio del Cavallo\r\non Vesuvius. There cannot, therefore, be any doubt that the sandstone,\r\nso irregularly dispersed through these lavas, was introduced originally\r\nas loose sand washed in from above so as to fill the numerous rents and\r\ncavernous interspaces of the volcanic rock. A more striking proof of\r\nthe subaqueous character of the eruptions could hardly be conceived.\r\nThis interesting feature in lavas erupted under water is not confined\r\nto the volcanic series of the Old Red Sandstone. We shall find that it\r\nis hardly less distinct among the basic lavas of the Permian series\r\nboth in Scotland and in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: See Jukes' _Manual of Geology_, 3rd edit. (1872), Fig.\r\n111, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Ground-plan of reticulated cracks in the upper\r\nsurface of an Old Red Sandstone lava filled in with sandstone. Red\r\nHead, Forfarshire.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable exception to the general type of dark basic and\r\nintermediate lavas is furnished by the pale, decomposing felsites of\r\nthe Pentland and Dolphinton Hills. Those which issue from the great\r\neruptive centre of the Braid Hills, alternate with the andesites and\r\nthe diabases, gradually diminishing like these in a southward direction\r\nand dying out in some six or seven miles. Beyond the limits of these\r\nlavas, another similar thick group was erupted from a separate vent\r\nat the northern end of the Biggar district near Dolphinton. The same\r\noccurrence has been ascertained also in the area of the Ochil chain.\r\nFuller reference will be made to these interesting rocks in the\r\ndescriptions to be afterwards given of the structure and history of the\r\nvolcanic areas of the Pentland Hills, the Biggar centre and the Ochil\r\nHills.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a notable feature in the volcanism of Old Red Sandstone\r\ntime that from the same, or from closely adjoining vents, lavas should\r\nbe alternately poured forth, differing so much from each other, alike\r\nin chemical composition and petrographical characters, as andesites\r\nand diabases on the one hand, and felsites on the other. Additional\r\nexamples, from widely different geological systems, will be cited\r\nin subsequent pages. It will be shown that even in the very latest\r\nvolcanic period in Britain, that of older Tertiary time, highly basic\r\nand markedly acid materials were ejected from the same centres of\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by the Tuffs in the structure of the ground agrees with\r\nwhat might have been expected in the accompaniments of extremely slaggy\r\nand viscid lavas. These pyroclastic intercalations are, in most of the\r\nvolcanic districts, comparatively insignificant in amount, by far the\r\nlargest proportion of solid material ejected from the various vents\r\nhaving consisted of streams of lava. Round or within some of the vents\r\nthe fragmentary materials attain a remarkable coarseness, as may be\r\nseen in the great agglomerates of Dumyat, near Stirling, the largest\r\nof which is more than 700 feet thick. These massive accumulations\r\ndoubtless represent a long series of explosive discharges from the\r\nsummit of the lava column in one or more adjacent vents. Traced away\r\nfrom the orifices of emission, the tuffs rapidly grow finer in grain,\r\nless in thickness, and more mixed with ordinary detritus, until they\r\npass into ordinary non-volcanic sediment or die out between the\r\nlava-sheets.\r\n\r\nGood sections, showing the nature and arrangement of the thin\r\nintercalations of andesite-tuff between the successive outpourings\r\nof lava, may be examined on the coast. Thus, near Turnberry Point,\r\nin Ayrshire, upwards of a dozen successive flows of lava, with their\r\nsandy and ashy intervening layers, are exposed in plan upon the beach,\r\nand partly also in section along the cliffs on which the ruins of the\r\nhistoric castle of Turnberry stand. (Figs. 95, 96, 97). Again, along\r\nthe coast of Forfarshire, from the Red Head to Montrose, the numerous\r\nsheets of andesite are separated by layers of dull purplish tuff\r\npassing into conglomerate, with blocks of porphyrite a yard or more in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable interstratified tuffs in the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone are the felsitic varieties. Those which proceed from the\r\ngreat vent of the Braid Hills, extend south-westwards for eight or nine\r\nmiles, and their peculiar materials, mixed with ordinary sediment,\r\nmay be traced several miles further. They occur in successive sheets,\r\nwhich, from a maximum thickness and number at the north end, gradually\r\nthin away southwards, like the felsitic lavas which they accompany, and\r\nfrom the explosion of which they no doubt were derived. They consist\r\nto a large extent of extremely fine volcanic dust, and since they are\r\ngenerally much decomposed, it is often, as already remarked, hardly\r\npossible to distinguish between them and the equally decayed felsites.\r\nIn some parts of the hills they present a distinct fissile bedding; but\r\nstill more satisfactory is the occasional fine brecciated structure\r\nwhich they assume, when they are seen to consist of angular lapilli of\r\ndifferent felsites.\r\n\r\nThe amount of volcanic material ejected from the more important vents\r\nwas much greater than the height of the present hills would lead us to\r\nsuppose. The rocks have generally been tilted into positions much more\r\ninclined than those which they originally occupied, so that to measure\r\ntheir actual thickness we must take a line approximately perpendicular\r\nto the dip. In this way we ascertain that the accumulated mass of lavas\r\nand tuffs immediately outside the vent at the north end of the Pentland\r\nHills must be at least 7000 feet thick, for the base of the series is\r\nconcealed under the unconformable overlap of the Lower Carboniferous\r\nSandstones, while the top is cut off by a fault which brings down\r\nthe Carboniferous formations against the eastern flank of the hills.\r\nProbably not less voluminous is the pile of ejected material in the\r\nOchil Hills, where, though the base of the whole is concealed by the\r\nfault which throws down the coal-field, some 6500 feet of lavas, tuffs\r\nand conglomerates can be seen. There were thus, during the time of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone, more than one volcano in Central Scotland\r\nwhich might be compared in bulk of ejected material to Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Section across the volcanic series of\r\nForfarshire. _a_, conglomerates, sandstones and flagstones; _b_, sheets\r\nof andesitic lava.]\r\n\r\nThat the eruptions were mainly subaqueous is indicated, as I have\r\nshown, by the intercalated bands of sandstone and conglomerate between\r\nthe successive lavas, as these are traced away from the centres of\r\ndischarge, and likewise, even more impressively, by the hardened sand\r\nwhich has been washed into former fissures and crevices in the lava.\r\nBut that, in some cases, the volcanic cones were built up above the\r\nsurface of the lake may be legitimately inferred from the remarkable\r\nvolcanic conglomerates which occur, more particularly in the great\r\nchain of the Ochil and Sidlaw Hills. These thick accumulations of\r\nwell-rounded and water-worn blocks are interspersed between sheets of\r\nandesite, and are mainly made up of andesite fragments. Impressive\r\nsections of them may be seen along the Kincardineshire coast. The\r\nconglomerates are sometimes so remarkably coarse, many of their blocks\r\nexceeding two feet in diameter, and so rudely bedded, that it is only\r\nby noting the position of oblong boulders that one can make out the\r\ngeneral direction of the stratification. In their smooth rounded forms,\r\nthese blocks resemble the materials of storm-beaches on an exposed\r\ncoast. The trituration of the andesite fragments has given rise to a\r\ncertain amount of green paste, which firmly wraps round the stones,\r\nand retains casts of them after they have dropped out. It is further\r\ndeserving of remark that while in some districts, as in the central\r\nOchils, the materials were entirely derived from the destruction of\r\nvolcanic rocks, in others a large proportion of non-volcanic materials\r\nis mingled with the debris of the lavas. South of Stonehaven, for\r\nexample, large boulders of quartzite form a conspicuous feature in the\r\nconglomerates, of which in places they make up quite half of the total\r\nconstituents. There can be little doubt, I think, that the materials\r\nof these coarse detrital accumulations were gathered together as\r\nshingle-beaches, and were derived in part from volcanic cones which had\r\nrisen above the level of the lake. They seem to suggest considerable\r\ndegradation of these cones by breaker-action, whereby blocks of rock a\r\nyard or more in diameter could be rounded and smoothed.\r\n\r\nAnother inference deducible from such conglomerates, and to which\r\nI have already alluded, is that considerable intervals of time\r\ntook place between some of the eruptions. Round the vents, indeed,\r\nwhere the successive sheets of volcanic material follow each other\r\ncontinuously, it is perhaps impossible to form any definite opinion\r\nas to the relative chronological value of the lines of separation\r\nbetween different ejections. But where some hundreds of feet of\r\ncoarse conglomerate, chiefly composed of well-rounded andesite\r\nblocks, intervene between two streams of lava, we may conclude that\r\nthe interval between the outpouring of these streams must have been\r\nof considerable duration. Other evidence of a similar tendency may\r\nbe recognized in the intercalation of groups of varied sedimentary\r\naccumulations, such as those which were deposited over the site of\r\nEastern Forfarshire and Kincardineshire during the time that elapsed\r\nbetween two successive floods of lava. In the Den of Canterland, for\r\nexample, in the midst of the volcanic sheets we find interesting\r\nevidence of one of these intervals of quiescence, during which\r\nlayers of fine olive shales were laid quietly down, while macerated\r\nvegetation, drifting over the lake-bottom, was buried with remains of\r\nfishes, and abundant gally-worms (_Kampecaris_, _Archidesmus_), washed\r\nfrom the neighbouring land.[343] So undisturbed were the conditions\r\nof deposition that calcareous sediment gathered round some of the\r\norganisms and encased them in limestone nodules.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: An abundant organism in some of these deposits, named\r\n_Parka_, was first regarded as a plant, was afterwards believed to\r\nbe the egg-packets of crustacea, and is now pronounced by competent\r\nauthorities to belong to an aquatic plant with creeping stems, linear\r\nleaves and sessile sporocarps.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the districts the discharges of volcanic material were so\r\nabundant or so continuous that no recognizable deposition of ordinary\r\nsediment has taken place between them. Thus, at the north end of\r\nthe Pentland Hills the rocks are entirely of volcanic origin, and\r\nthough, as we trace them southwards away from the centre of eruption,\r\nthey diminish in thickness, they include hardly any interstratified\r\nsandstones and conglomerates until they finally begin to die out.\r\n\r\nThe distances to which the lavas and tuffs have been erupted from the\r\nchief vents of a district vary up to 15 or 20 miles. Those of the\r\nPentland Hills extend from the Braid Hill vent for 10 miles to the\r\nsouth-west. Those of the Biggar centre stretch for about 16 miles to\r\nthe north-east. Those of the Ochil Hills, which probably came from a\r\nnumber of distinct vents, can be traced for nearly 50 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. VENTS\r\n\r\nOn the whole the actual vents of the volcanoes of Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone time are less clearly distinguishable than those of\r\nsubsequent volcanic periods. This deficiency doubtless arises from the\r\ngeological structure of the districts in which the formation is chiefly\r\ndeveloped. Thus, in the great Midland Valley of Scotland, where the Old\r\nRed Sandstone covers a large part of the surface, the vents seem to\r\nhave been placed along the central parts of the long trough rather than\r\namong the older rocks on either margin. Hence they are in large measure\r\nburied either under the volcanic and sedimentary accumulations of their\r\nown period or under Carboniferous strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Section across two necks above Tillicoultry,\r\nOchil Hills.\r\n\r\n1 1, Andesite lavas; 2 2, Tuffs and volcanic conglomerates; 3 3, The\r\ntwo necks; 4 4, Dykes of felsite, etc.; 5, Coal-measures; _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nCertain bosses of massive rocks lying well within the volcanic area may\r\nwith some confidence be regarded as the sites of eruptive centres. They\r\noccur either singly or in groups, and may be specially noticed along\r\nthe chain of the Ochil and Sidlaw Hills. Yet it seems to me probable\r\nthat these visible bosses, even if we are correct in regarding them as\r\nmarking the positions of true vents, do not indicate the chief orifices\r\nof discharge. If we consider their size and their distribution with\r\nreference to the areas of lava and tuff discharged at the surface,\r\nwe are rather led to look upon them as subsidiary vents, the more\r\nimportant orifices, from which the main bulk of the eruptions took\r\nplace, being still concealed under the Carboniferous rocks of the\r\nMidland Valley. The bosses which rise through different portions of the\r\nvolcanic series are obviously not the oldest or original vents. The\r\ngreat felsitic mass of Tinto in Lanarkshire (Fig. 93), indeed, pierces\r\nstrata which lie near the base of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, but the\r\nsmaller cone of Quothquan in its neighbourhood appears in the midst\r\nof the lavas (Fig. 92). In the south-western part of the Ochil chain\r\nthe bosses or necks are chiefly small in size, seldom exceeding half\r\na mile in diameter. They have been filled sometimes with crystalline,\r\nsometimes with fragmental materials. Two of them, containing the\r\nremarkable granophyric quartz-diorite already referred to, emerge\r\nfrom among the tuffs in a low part of the series, immediately above\r\nthe village of Tillicoultry in Clackmannan (Fig. 68). Two or three\r\nmore, which are occupied by orthophyres and quartz-felsites, pierce\r\nthe volcanic group a few miles to the west of Loch Leven. The whole of\r\nthe visible bosses of the Ochil Hills may be regarded as one connected\r\ngroup, subsidiary to the main orifices which lay rather further to the\r\nsouth and west. More particular reference to this district will be made\r\nin the following chapter (p. 303).\r\n\r\nVents which have been filled up with agglomerate, and which thus\r\nfurnish the most obvious proofs of their connection with the eruptions\r\nof the volcanic series, though not frequent, may be observed in a\r\nnumber of the volcanic districts. Their fragmentary materials generally\r\nconsist mainly of the detritus of andesites or diabases like those\r\nwhich form the bedded lavas. But where more acid lavas have risen to\r\nthe surface, fragments of felsite may occur more or less abundantly.\r\nIn the great vent of the Braid Hills the tuffs and breccias are\r\nalmost wholly acid. Non-volcanic materials may often be found in the\r\nagglomerates, and occasionally even to the exclusion of volcanic\r\ndetritus. Thus, in the far north of Scotland several examples occur\r\namong the Shetland Isles of necks filled entirely with blocks of\r\nthe surrounding flagstones and sandstones. Such cases, as has been\r\nalready pointed out, probably represent incompleted volcanoes, when\r\nthe explosive vapours were powerful enough to drill orifices in the\r\ncrust of the earth and eject the shattered debris from them, but were\r\nnot sufficiently vigorous or lasting to bring up any solid or liquid\r\nvolcanic material to the surface. These Shetland examples are further\r\nnoticed on p. 345.\r\n\r\nNecks of agglomerate in the Lower Old Red Sandstone vary in size from\r\na great orifice measuring two miles across to little plugs only a few\r\nyards in diameter. They may be found in limited numbers in most of\r\nthe volcanic districts. No examples have been observed rising through\r\nolder rocks than the Old Red Sandstone, all the known instances being\r\neruptive through some part of the volcanic series or of the sandstones,\r\nand therefore not belonging to the earliest eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe largest, and in some respects the most interesting, vent in the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone, that of the Braid Hills near Edinburgh,\r\ndescribed in Chapter xx., covers an area of more than two square miles,\r\nand is filled with felsitic breccias and tuffs, through which bosses\r\nand veins of acid and basic rocks have been injected. It completely\r\ntruncates the bedded lavas and tuffs of the Pentland Hills, and not\r\nimprobably marks the chief centre from which these rocks were erupted.\r\nSeveral smaller necks rise a little beyond its southern margin,\r\nmarking, perhaps, lateral cones on the main volcano.\r\n\r\nIn the small area of Lower Old Red Sandstone lying between Campbeltown\r\nand the Mull of Cantyre, several necks of agglomerate occur, which have\r\nbeen partly dissected by the waves along the shore, thus revealing\r\ntheir internal structure and their relation to the surrounding\r\nconglomerates. An account of them will be found at p. 311. One of the\r\nseries, which lies back from the coast-line, forms a prominent rounded\r\nhill measuring about 400 yards in its longest diameter. Its general\r\ncontour is represented in Fig. 82.\r\n\r\nOf the eruptive bosses of massive rock outside the limits of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone which may be plausibly referred to the volcanic phenomena\r\nof the period, though they cannot be proved to be actually part of\r\nthem, the most notable are the bosses of granite and other acid\r\nmaterial which rise through the Silurian strata of the Southern Uplands\r\nof Scotland.[344] The largest are the well-known masses of Galloway\r\n(Fig. 69), with which must be grouped the bosses near New Cumnock,\r\nthat of the Spango Water (Fig. 94), and those of Cockburn Law and\r\nPriestlaw in Lammermuir, together with a number of masses of felsitic\r\nmaterial scattered over the same region, such as the Dirrington Laws of\r\nBerwickshire (Fig. 70). These bosses present some points of structure\r\nin common with true vents. They come like great vertical columns\r\nthrough highly-folded and puckered strata, and, as they truncate the\r\nLlandovery and Wenlock formations, they are certainly younger than the\r\ngreater part of the Upper Silurian series. They must be later, too,\r\nthan the chief plication and cleavage of these strata; but they are\r\nolder than the Upper Old Red Sandstone or basement Carboniferous rocks\r\nwhich contain pebbles of them. Their date of eruption is thus narrowed\r\nto the interval between the later part of the Upper Silurian period\r\nand the beginning of the Upper Old Red Sandstone. I have myself little\r\ndoubt that they are to be associated with the volcanic epoch we are now\r\nconsidering, as it was the only known great episode of igneous activity\r\nin this region during the interval within which the protrusion of these\r\ngranites must have taken place. In the Cheviot Hills, indeed, we have\r\nevidence of the eruption of a large mass of augite-granitite through\r\nthe porphyrite-lavas of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, with abundant\r\nveins projecting from it into them, as will be narrated in later\r\npages.[345]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: I suggested this possible connection many years ago in\r\n_Trans. Geol. Soc. Edin._ vol. ii. (1874) p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: The volcanic geology of the Cheviot Hills is described\r\nby Mr. Teall, _Geol. Mag. for 1883_, p. 106; and by Mr. Clough, _Mem.\r\nGeol. Survey_, \"Geology of the Cheviot Hills,\" Sheet 108 N.E., 1888, p.\r\n24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Section of the granite core between Merrick\r\nand Corscrine.\r\n\r\n_a_, Silurian greywackes, grits and shales; _b_, granite.]\r\n\r\nNot improbably many other granite protrusions throughout the British\r\nIsles are to be referred to the volcanic operations of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone. Such are those of the Lake District, notably that\r\nof Shap,[346] the granites of Newry and Leinster in the east of\r\nIreland, which are later than the Silurian rocks and older than the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone, and the younger Grampian granites, which\r\npierce the presumably Arenig belt along the Highland border. Whether\r\nor not these granitic protrusions were connected with superficial\r\nvolcanic discharges of which no remains have survived, they seem to\r\nindicate the wide extent and remarkable vigour of the subterranean\r\nigneous action of this geological period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: See the descriptions of the Shap granite by Messrs. Marr\r\nand Harker, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvii. (1891) p. 266, and xlix.\r\n(1893) p. 359.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Section across the three Dirrington Laws,\r\nBerwickshire.\r\n\r\n_a_, Upper Silurian strata; _b_, Necks probably of Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone age; _c_, Upper Old Red Sandstone lying unconformably both on\r\n_a_ and _b_.]\r\n\r\nViewed as a whole, the materials which now occupy the vents of the\r\nvolcanic chains in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of the British Isles\r\nare more acid than the lavas erupted at the surface. In the Pentland\r\ndistrict, indeed, and in some other areas this acid material was\r\nejected at intervals in abundant discharges of dust and lapilli and in\r\noutflows of felsitic lavas, while between these successive discharges\r\ncopious streams of diabasic and andesitic lavas, either from the same\r\nor from some closely-adjoining vent, were poured out. Throughout the\r\nwhole region, however, as a closing phase of the volcanic history,\r\nthe acid magma rose after the outpouring of the more basic lavas and\r\nfilled such chimneys of the volcanoes as were not already blocked with\r\nagglomerate. It was probably after these pipes were plugged that the\r\nfinal efforts of volcanic energy were expended in the protrusion of the\r\nacid material as sills between the bedding-planes of the surrounding\r\nrocks, and as dykes and veins in and around the vents.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. SILLS AND DYKES\r\n\r\nNowhere throughout the volcanic tracts of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nis there any such development of sills as may be seen beneath the\r\nSilurian volcanic sheets of North Wales. Those which occur are most\r\nabundant in the Lanarkshire district, to the north-west and south-west\r\nof Tinto, and in the south of Ayrshire. From the village of Muirkirk to\r\nthe gorge of the Clyde, below the Falls, the Upper Silurian and Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone strata are traversed by numerous intrusive sheets\r\nof pink and yellow felsite, quartz-porphyry, minette, lamprophyre and\r\nallied rocks, which are no doubt to be regarded as part of the volcanic\r\nphenomena with which we are here concerned. In the south of Ayrshire,\r\nbetween the villages of Dalmellington and Barr, there is a copious\r\ndevelopment of similar sills, especially along one or more horizons\r\nnear the base of the Old Red Sandstone. Garleffin Fell, Glenalla Fell,\r\nTurgeny and other heights are conspicuous prominences formed of these\r\nrocks; above the sills lie thick conglomerates and sandstones on which\r\nthe great andesite-sheets rest.\r\n\r\nIn the Pentland Hills, as will be described in Chapter xx., a massive\r\nfelsitic sill forms a conspicuous feature along the north side of the\r\nchain, and there are probably others which have not yet been separated\r\nfrom the felsitic tuffs and orthophyres which they so much resemble.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable acid sills in the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nBritain are those which occur at the extreme northern end of the region\r\namong the volcanic phenomena of the Shetland Isles (Figs. 71, 72). The\r\nlargest of them, consisting mainly of granite and felsite, is believed\r\nto reach a length of 20 and a breadth of from three to four miles.[347]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: Messrs. B. N. Peach and J. Horne, _Trans. Roy. Soc.\r\nEdin._ xxxii. (1884), p. 359.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Section of Papa Stour, Shetlands, showing\r\nsill of spherulitic felsite traversing Old Red Sandstone and bedded\r\nporphyrites (Messrs. Peach and Horne).\r\n\r\n1. Red sandstones and flagstones; 2.

Bedded andesites and tuffs. _f_,\r\nFault.]\r\n\r\nA group of sills composed of a bright red quartz-porphyry has been\r\ntraced along the southern flanks of the Highlands for upwards of\r\n18 miles.[348] This rock, already referred to as the \"Lintrathen\r\nporphyry,\" lies chiefly among the conglomerates and sandstones, but\r\nalso intersects the lavas, and may be later than the Old Red Sandstone\r\n(p. 277). An extension of it is found even on the north side of the\r\nboundary fault, cutting the andesites which there lie unconformably on\r\nthe schists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: See Sheet 56 of the Geological Survey of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nExamples, however, occur of sills much less acid in composition. In\r\nthe Dundee district, for instance, the intrusive sheets are andesites\r\nand diabases. They send veins into and bake the sandstones among which\r\nthey have been intruded, and are sometimes full of fragments of such\r\nindurated sandstone, as may be well seen on the northern shore of the\r\nFirth of Tay, west of Dundee.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous characteristic of most of the volcanic tracts of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone is the comparative scarcity of contemporaneous\r\ndykes. In the band of acid sills between Muirkirk and the Clyde, a\r\nconsiderable number of dykes have been mapped, which must be regarded\r\nas due to the same series of movements and protrusions of the magma\r\nthat produced the adjacent sills. Throughout the length of the Southern\r\nUplands dykes of felsite, minette, lamprophyre, vogesite and other\r\nvarieties, which may also be connected with the volcanic phenomena of\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone, not infrequently occur among the Silurian\r\nrocks. On the Kincardineshire coast, south of Bervie, a number of dykes\r\nof pink quartz-porphyry traverse the conglomerates and sandstones. The\r\ncoast south of Montrose displays some singularly picturesque sections,\r\nwhere a porphyry dyke running through andesitic lavas and agglomerates\r\nstands up in wall-like and tower-like projections. On the shore at\r\nGourdon, as well as inland, intrusive dykes of serpentine occur. A line\r\nof these, possibly along the same fissure, has been traced for more\r\nthan a dozen of miles from above Cortachy Castle to near Bamff. But\r\nthere is no evidence to connect them with the volcanic phenomena of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. Not improbably they belong to a later geological\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOne would expect to meet with a network of dykes in and around the\r\nvolcanic vents; but even there they are usually not conspicuous either\r\nfor number or size. In the great vent of the Braid Hills only a few\r\nhave been noticed. In the Ochil Hills groups of dykes of felsite and\r\nandesite may be observed, especially near the necks. They are fairly\r\nnumerous in the neighbourhood of Dollar (see Fig. 68). One of the most\r\nabundant series yet observed traverses the tract around the granite\r\nboss of the Cheviot Hills, from which many dykes of granite, felsite,\r\nquartz-porphyry and andesite radiate. This district will be more fully\r\nreferred to in Chapter xxi. Another remarkable development of dykes\r\noccurs in Shetland (Fig. 72), where they consist of granite, felsite\r\nand rhyolite, and are associated with the acid sills above referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE LOWER OLD RED SANDSTONE OF \"LAKE CALEDONIA\"\r\n\r\n  Description of the several Volcanic Districts: \"Lake Caledonia,\"\r\n     its Chains of Volcanoes--The Northern Chain: Montrose Group,\r\n     Ochil and Sidlaw Hills, the Arran and Cantyre Centre, the Ulster\r\n     Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now propose to give some account of each of the districts which have\r\nbeen separate areas of volcanic action during the time of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, tracing its general structure, the arrangement and\r\nsequence of its volcanic rocks and the history of its eruptions. As by\r\nfar the most varied development of the Old Red Sandstone is to be found\r\nin the great Midland Valley of Scotland, and as it is there that the\r\nremarkable volcanic phenomena of the system have been most abundantly\r\ndisplayed and are most clearly recorded, I shall begin my description\r\nof the volcanic eruptions of the Lower Old Red Sandstone with a\r\ndetailed account of the different centres of volcanic activity in that\r\nregion. The phenomena are so fully displayed there that a more summary\r\ntreatment of the subject will suffice for the other regions.\r\n\r\nUnder the designation of \"Lake Caledonia,\" as already remarked, I\r\ninclude the whole of the Midland Valley of Scotland between the\r\nHighlands and the Southern Uplands, likewise the continuation of the\r\nsame ancient hollow by Arran and the south of Cantyre across the\r\nnorth of Ireland to Lough Erne.[349] Throughout most of the area thus\r\ndefined, the present limits of the Lower Old Red Sandstone are sharply\r\nmarked off by large parallel faults. On the north-west side one, or\r\nrather a parallel series, of such dislocations runs from Stonehaven\r\nalong the flank of the Highland mountains to the Clyde, thus traversing\r\nthe whole breadth of the island. On the south-east side another\r\nsimilar series of faults, which there skirts the edge of the Silurian\r\ntableland, has nearly the same effect in precisely defining the margin\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone. As thus limited, the tract has a breadth of\r\nabout 50 miles in Scotland, while the portion of it now visible in the\r\nBritish Isles has an extreme length of about 280 miles (Map III.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: My own investigations of this region have been continued\r\nover an interval of forty years. Besides personally traversing every\r\nportion of it, I have mapped in detail, for the Geological Survey, many\r\nhundreds of square miles of its area from the outskirts of Edinburgh\r\nsouth-westwards into Lanarkshire, in Ayrshire, and in the counties of\r\nFife, Perth and Kinross. The Geological Survey maps of the volcanic\r\ntracts of the Sidlaw Hills have been prepared by my brother, Prof.\r\nJames Geikie, and Messrs. H. M. Skae and D. R. Irvine. The Western\r\nOchils were mapped chiefly by Mr. B. N. Peach, partly by Prof. J.\r\nYoung, Mr. R. L. Jack and myself; the Eastern Ochils were surveyed\r\nmainly by Mr. H. H. Howell; while the volcanic belt between the tracts\r\nmapped by me in Lanarkshire and in Ayrshire was chiefly traced out by\r\nMr. Peach. As a rule, each of these geologists has described in the\r\nSurvey Memoirs the portions of country surveyed by him.]\r\n\r\nBut though the boundary-faults determine, on the whole, the present\r\nlimits of the tract of Old Red Sandstone, they do not necessarily\r\nindicate the shore-lines of the sheet of water in which that great\r\nseries of deposits was laid down. They point to an enormous subsidence\r\nof the tract between them--a prolonged and extensive sagging of the\r\nstrip of country that stretches across the Midland Valley of Scotland\r\ninto the north of Ireland.[350] This downward movement began as far\r\nback as the close of the Silurian period, but the marginal fractures\r\nand the disruption and plication of the thick masses of sandstone and\r\nconglomerate which were accumulated in the lake chiefly took place\r\nafter the close of the period of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. I think\r\nwe may reasonably connect these movements with the general sinking of\r\nthe area consequent upon the enormous outpouring of volcanic materials\r\nduring that period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: In some of the dislocations along the Highland border,\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone is bent back upon itself, and the older schists\r\nare thus made to recline upon it, as if there had been a push over from\r\nthe Highland area.]\r\n\r\nAlong both the northern and southern margins of the basin there occur,\r\non the farther side of the boundary faults, outlying patches of Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone that rest unconformably on the rocks forming the\r\nflanks of the hills. These areas possess a peculiar interest, inasmuch\r\nas they reveal some parts of the shore-line of the lake, and show the\r\nrelation between the earlier rocks and the sediments of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. We learn from them that the shore-line was indented with\r\nwide bays, but nevertheless ran in a general north-easterly direction.\r\nIt thus corresponded in trend with the present Midland Valley, with the\r\naxes of plication among the schists of the Highlands as well as among\r\nthe Silurian rocks of the Southern Uplands, and with the subsequent\r\nfaulting and folding of the Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Section at the edge of one of the bays of\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone along the northern margin of Lake Caledonia,\r\nnear Ochtertyre.\r\n\r\n_a_, slates and phyllites; _b_, volcanic conglomerates; _c_,\r\nandesite-lava.]\r\n\r\nI may remark in passing that the conglomerates and other associated\r\nmaterials which have been preserved in these bays and hollows beyond\r\nthe lines of the great faults, though they lie unconformably on the\r\nrocks beneath, are not the basement portions of the Old Red Sandstone.\r\nOn the contrary, where their probable stratigraphical horizons can be\r\nrecognized or inferred, they are found to belong to parts of the series\r\nconsiderably above the base of the whole. They point to the gradual\r\nsinking of the basin and the creeping of the waters with their littoral\r\nshingles further and further up the slopes of the hills on either side\r\n(Fig. 73).\r\n\r\nBut this is not all the evidence that can be adduced to show that\r\nthe limits of the lake extended considerably beyond the lines of\r\ndislocation between which the present area of Old Red Sandstone mainly\r\nlies. No one can look at the noble escarpments of the Braes of Doune\r\non the one side (Fig. 74), or walk over the upturned conglomerates and\r\nandesites which flank the Lanarkshire uplands on the other, without\r\nbeing convinced that if the effects of the boundary faults could be\r\nundone, so as to restore the original structure of the ground, the\r\nprolongations of the rocks, now removed by denudation, would be found\r\nsweeping far into the Highlands on the north and into the Silurian\r\nUplands on the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 74.--Craig Beinn nan-Eun (2067 feet), east of Uam Var, Braes\r\n     of Doune. Old Red Conglomerate, with the truncated ends of the\r\n     strata looking across into the Highlands; moraines of Corry\r\n     Beach in the foreground.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the area of \"Lake Caledonia\" were taken to be defined by the\r\nboundary faults, it covered a space of about 10,000 square miles.\r\nBut, as we know that it certainly stretched beyond the limits marked\r\nby these faults, it must have been of still greater extent. We shall\r\nprobably not exaggerate if we regard it as somewhat larger than the\r\npresent Lake Erie, the superficies of which is about 9900 square miles.\r\nIn this long narrow basin the remarkable volcanic history was enacted\r\nof which I now proceed to give some account.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Old Red Sandstone of Central Scotland may be conveniently\r\ndivided into three great groups, each of which marks a distinct epoch\r\nin the history of the basin wherein they were successively accumulated.\r\nThe lowest of these groups indicates a time of quiet sedimentation\r\nduring which the basin was defined by plication of the terrestrial\r\ncrust, and when, by the same subterranean movements, some parts of\r\nthe floor of the lake were pushed upward above water, and were then\r\ndenuded and buried. The middle group consists largely of volcanic\r\nrocks. It points to the existence of lines of active volcanic cones\r\nsituated along the length of the lake. The uppermost group records the\r\nextinction of volcanic action and the gradual obliteration of the lake,\r\npartly by the pouring of sediment into it, and partly no doubt by the\r\ncontinued terrestrial movements which had originally produced the basin.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these records that though volcanic activity\r\ncontinued vigorous for a vast period of time, it had entirely ceased\r\nin \"Lake Caledonia\" long before the last sediments of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone were laid down. The great cones of the Ochil Hills, for\r\nexample, sank below the waters of the lake in which they had long been\r\na conspicuous feature, and so protracted was the subsidence of the\r\nlake-bottom that the site of these volcanoes was buried under 8000 or\r\n9000 feet of sandstones and conglomerates, among which no trace of any\r\nvolcanic eruptions has yet been found. The sagging of the terrestrial\r\ncrust over an area from which such an enormous amount of volcanic\r\nproducts had been discharged would doubtless be a protracted process.\r\nLong after the subsidence of the lake-bottom and the accumulation of\r\nits thick mass of sediments, after even the entire effacement of the\r\ntopography and the deposition of the thick Carboniferous formations\r\nover its site, the downward movement showed itself in the production of\r\ngigantic north-east faults, and the sinking of the Carboniferous rocks\r\nfor several thousand feet. These dislocations, as was natural, have run\r\nthrough the heart of some of the volcanic groups, carrying much of the\r\nevidence of the ancient volcanoes out of sight, and leaving us only\r\nfragments from which to piece together the records of a volcanic period\r\nwhich is by no means the least interesting in the geological history of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nConfining our attention for the present to the records of the middle or\r\nvolcanic group, we find evidence of a number of distinct clusters of\r\nvolcanoes ranged along the whole length of the basin. The independence\r\nof these volcanic districts may be inferred from the following\r\nfacts:--1st, The actual vents of discharge may in some cases be\r\nrecognized; 2nd, Even where these vents have been buried, we may often\r\nobserve, as we approach their probable sites, a marked increase in the\r\nthickness of the volcanic accumulations, as well as a great development\r\nof agglomerates and tuffs; 3rd, Traced in opposite directions, the\r\nvolcanic materials are found to thin away or even to disappear. Those\r\nfrom one centre of discharge may be observed now and then to overlap\r\nthose from another, but the two series remain distinct.\r\n\r\nReasoning from these data and studying the distribution of the various\r\nvolcanic areas, we are led to recognize the former existence of two\r\nparallel chains of vents, running along the length of the lake at a\r\ndistance from each other of somewhere about twenty miles. They may be\r\nconveniently distinguished as the northern and the southern chain.\r\n\r\nThe northern band runs from the coast-line near Stonehaven\r\nsouth-westward through the Sidlaw and Ochil Hills. It is then abruptly\r\ntruncated by a large fault and by the unconformable superposition of\r\nthe Carboniferous formations. But 60 miles further to the south-west,\r\nwhere the Old Red Sandstone comes out on the west side of the Firth of\r\nClyde, a continuation of the volcanic band has recently been detected\r\nby Mr. W. Gunn of the Geological Survey in the Island of Arran.\r\nTwenty-five miles still further in the same direction a much ampler\r\ndevelopment of the volcanic rocks occurs to the south of Campbeltown\r\nin Cantyre. If we cross the 22 miles of sea that separate the\r\nArgyllshire coast-sections from those of Red Bay in Ireland, we find\r\nnear Cushendall a repetition of the Scottish volcanic conglomerates,\r\nwhile still further along the same persistent line, some 50 miles into\r\nthe interior, the hills of Tyrone include sheets of lava precisely\r\nlike those of Central Scotland. The total length of this northern\r\nchain of volcanoes is thus not much less than 250 miles, and as its\r\nnorth-eastern end is now cut off by the North Sea it must have been\r\nstill longer. It ran parallel to the north-western coast-line of the\r\nlake, at a distance which, over the site of the Midland Valley of\r\nScotland, seems to have varied from 10 to 20 miles, but which greatly\r\nlessened further to the south-west.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of some twenty miles to the south of the northern belt,\r\nthe second parallel chain of volcanoes ran in a nearly straight\r\nline, which is now traceable from the southern suburbs of Edinburgh\r\nto the coast of Ayrshire, a distance of about 75 miles, but as its\r\nnorth-eastern end is concealed by Carboniferous formations, and its\r\nsouth-western passes under the sea, its true length is probably\r\nconsiderably more.\r\n\r\nIf the areas which present evidence of distinct and independent vents\r\nare grouped according to their positions on these two lines, they\r\nnaturally arrange themselves as in the following list:--\r\n\r\n  I. Northern Chain of Volcanoes\r\n\r\n    1. The Montrose Centre.\r\n    2. The Sidlaw and Ochil Group.\r\n    3. The Arran and Cantyre Centre.\r\n    4. The Ulster Centres.\r\n\r\n  II. Southern Chain of Volcanoes\r\n\r\n    5. The Pentland Volcano.\r\n    6. The Biggar Centre.\r\n    7. The Duneaton Centre.\r\n    8. The Ayrshire Group.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of these various volcanic areas will be most easily\r\nunderstood from an examination of Map III. accompanying this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE NORTHERN CHAIN OF VOLCANOES IN \"LAKE CALEDONIA\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Montrose Centre_\r\n\r\nBeginning at the north-eastern end of the area, we first encounter\r\na series of volcanic rocks which attain their maximum thickness in\r\nForfarshire around the town of Montrose. The main vents probably lay\r\nsomewhere to the east of the present coast, under the floor of the\r\nNorth Sea; at least no clear indication of their existence either on\r\nthe coast or inland has been detected. From Montrose, both to the\r\nnorth-east and south-west, the lavas thin away, becoming intercalated\r\namong the sandstones, flagstones and conglomerates, and gradually dying\r\nout. The total length of the volcanic belt is about 18 miles, that is\r\nnine miles from the central thick mass in a north-easterly and the same\r\ndistance in a south-westerly direction.[351] The volcanic pile must be\r\nseveral thousand feet thick, but owing to the prolongation of the great\r\nOchil anticline, the lavas roll over and do not allow their base to be\r\nseen. The axis of the fold must pass out to sea, through the hollow\r\non which the town of Montrose stands. The volcanic series consists\r\nof andesite-sheets with volcanic conglomerates. It contains little\r\nordinary tuff, but the conglomerates no doubt partly represent ejected\r\nfragmental material, as well as the waste of exposed lavas. A section\r\nacross the anticlinal fold from Forfar to Panbride, a little to the\r\nsouth-west of Montrose, would reveal the structure shown in Fig. 67.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: The south-western part of this area from Arbroath to\r\nJohnshaven was mapped for the Geological Survey by the late Mr. H. M.\r\nSkae, the north-eastern part by Mr. D. R. Irvine. My account of it is\r\nmainly taken from notes made by myself on the ground preliminary to the\r\ncommencement of the mapping of the Survey.]\r\n\r\nIn the north-eastern prolongation of the volcanic series from the\r\nMontrose centre, successively lower members are exposed along the\r\ncoast-line. But the lavas are dying out in that direction, and\r\nsometimes many hundreds of feet of ordinary sediment intervene between\r\ntwo successive flows. It was in one of these long pauses near the\r\ntop of the whole pile of lavas that the strata of Canterland were\r\ndeposited, to which reference has already been made. South-west from\r\nMontrose the thick volcanic mass rapidly diminishes, and is prolonged\r\nto the end only by three or four bands separated by sandstones and\r\nflagstones. It is in these intercalated groups of sedimentary material\r\nthat the \"Forfarshire flags\" occur.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the details of the Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks be more\r\nconveniently studied than along the coast-section in this district\r\nfrom the Red Head to Stonehaven. The rocks have not only been cut into\r\nvertical cliffs, but along many parts of the shore they have been also\r\nlaid bare in ground-plan, so that a complete dissection of them is\r\npresented to the geologist. At the south end, the top of the volcanic\r\nseries appears at the bold promontory of the Red Head. There, at the\r\nbase of the cliffs of red sandstone, the accompanying section may be\r\nseen. Beneath the red false-bedded and sometimes pebbly sandstones\r\n(_e_), which form nearly the whole precipice, lies a band of dull\r\npurplish ashy conglomerate (_d_), composed almost wholly of fragments\r\nof different andesites, imbedded in a paste of the same comminuted\r\nmaterial. Towards the south, this rock rapidly becomes coarser, until\r\nit passes into a kind of agglomerate, in which the andesite blocks are\r\nsometimes a yard or more in diameter. It includes bands of sandstone,\r\nwhich increase in number and thickness towards the north, and sometimes\r\nintervene underneath the conglomerate. The lowest rocks here visible\r\nare sheets of andesite or \"porphyrite\" (_a_), separated from each other\r\nby irregular bright red layers of tufaceous sand and agglomerate. These\r\nlavas are dull purplish-grey to green, some of them being tolerably\r\ncompact, others highly amygdaloidal, with large steam-cavities often\r\ndrawn out in the direction of flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Section showing the top of the volcanic series\r\nat the foot of the precipice of the Red Head, Forfarshire.\r\n\r\n_a_, Top of slaggy andesite; _b_, coarse volcanic conglomerate;\r\n_c_, Red sandstone; _d_, Tuff and volcanic conglomerate; _e_, Red\r\nsandstones.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features in the andesites of this coast is the\r\nremarkable manner in which they include the veinings of pale green and\r\nred sandstone already described (see Figs. 65, 66). Some of the sheets\r\nhave in cooling cracked into rude polygons. They are likewise traversed\r\nby large cavernous spaces and intricate fissures or steam-cavities.\r\nInto all these openings the sand has been washed, filling them up and\r\nsolidifying into well-stratified sandstone, the bedding of which is\r\ngenerally parallel with that of the rocks that enclose it, the dip of\r\nthe whole series of strata being gently seawards. But a still more\r\nintimate mixture of the sand with the lava-sheets is to be remarked\r\nwhere these rocks assume their most slaggy character. In some of them\r\nthe upper part, to a depth of ten or twelve feet, consists of mere\r\nrugged lumps of slag which, while the mass was in motion, were probably\r\nin large measure loose, and rolled over each other as they were borne\r\nonward. The sand has found its way into all the interstices of these\r\nclinker-beds, and now binds the whole mass firmly together. At first\r\nsight, these bands might be taken for agglomerates of ejected blocks,\r\nand as already suggested, some of the slags may have been thrown out\r\nas loose pieces, but a little examination will show that in the main\r\nthe rough scoriaceous lumps are pieces of the lava underneath. In\r\nthese instances, also, it is clear that the blocks were in position\r\nbefore the fine sand was sifted into their interspaces, for the pale\r\ngreen sandstone is horizontally stratified through its intricate\r\nramifications among the pile of dark clinkers.\r\n\r\nThe seaward inclination of the rocks allows the succession of lavas\r\nto be seen as the coast is followed westward into Lunan Bay. On the\r\nfurther side of that inlet, after passing over a group of sandstones\r\nthat underlie the volcanic series of the Red Head, the observer\r\nmeets with a second and lower succession of lavas which in the five\r\nmiles northward to Montrose Harbour are admirably exposed both along\r\ncoast-cliffs and on the beach. They resemble those of the Red Head,\r\nbeing made up of alternations of highly vesicular andesite with more\r\ncompact varieties, and showing similar sandstone veinings. Here\r\nand there, as at Fishtown of Usar, the sea has cut them down into\r\na platform from which the harder parts rise as fantastic half-tide\r\nstacks. In some cases, the more durable rock consists of the slaggy\r\nupper portions of the flows, and in one case this material stands\r\nup as a rude pillar twelve feet high, composed of clinkers firmly\r\ncemented with veinings of sandstone. The geologist who wanders over\r\nthis coast-line is arrested at every turn by the marvellously fresh\r\nvolcanic aspect of many of the lavas. Their upper parts are so cellular\r\nthat if the calcite, chalcedony and other infiltrated minerals were\r\nremoved from their vesicles, they would be transformed into surfaces of\r\nmere slag. In one respect would their antiquity still be evident. These\r\nslaggy bands are generally a good deal reddened, as if they had been\r\nlong exposed to oxidation before being covered by the overlying sheets\r\nof lava--a feature already cited, as probably indicating the lapse of\r\nsome considerable interval of time between successive outflows.\r\n\r\nAlong this coast-section the absence of intercalated tuffs is soon\r\nremarked. The volcanic ejections seem to have consisted almost entirely\r\nof andesitic lavas, though it is possible that here and there the very\r\nslaggy bands between the more solid parts of the sheets may include a\r\nlittle pyroclastic material. The lowest portion of the volcanic group\r\nhere visible is reached at Montrose Harbour, where, in the flagstones\r\nand shales of Ferryden, the late Rev. Hugh Mitchell obtained some of\r\nthe fossil-fishes of the formation.\r\n\r\nA space of more than three miles now intervenes where the rocks are\r\nconcealed by blown sand and other superficial accumulations. It is\r\nthrough this hollow, as already stated, that the great Ochil anticline\r\nruns out to sea. On the north side of the North Esk River, we again\r\ncome upon the same band of lavas as to the south of Montrose, but with\r\na dip to the north-west. This inclination, however, soon bends round\r\nmore westerly, and the result of the change is to expose a slowly\r\ndescending section all the way to the Highland fault at Stonehaven.\r\n\r\nA picturesque line of high inland cliff, running northwards beyond\r\nSt. Cyrus, reveals with great clearness the bedded structure of\r\nthe andesites. But as one moves northward, owing to the change in\r\nthe direction of dip, one finally passes out of this volcanic belt\r\nand begins gradually to descend into the thick Kincardineshire Old\r\nRed Sandstone. The amount of conglomerate exposed along this part\r\nof the coast-line probably considerably surpasses in thickness\r\nany other conglomerate series in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of\r\nBritain. Throughout the enormous depth of sedimentary material,\r\nthe conglomerates are well-bedded, consisting of a dull green\r\npaste, composed in large degree of comminuted andesitic debris, and\r\ninterstratified with green felspathic sandstones. They are often\r\nremarkably coarse, the pebbles sometimes measuring three feet in\r\nlength. Interposed among them are some ten or twelve bands, probably\r\noften single outflows of andesite, sometimes compact and porphyritic,\r\nat other times highly amygdaloidal. Such is the succession of rocks\r\nfor many miles along the shore; and as the inclination varies from\r\na little north of west to west, or even west by south, the observer\r\ngradually passes over a thickness of rather more than 2000 feet from\r\nthe base of the St. Cyrus andesites to Gourdon. In this accumulation\r\nof coarse, well water-worn material, with abundant intercalations of\r\nfiner sandstone and occasional sheets of lava, there is the record of\r\nprolonged and powerful denudation with intermittent volcanic activity.\r\nDykes of a quartziferous porphyry cut the conglomerates, and at Gourdon\r\nthey are pierced by the intrusion of serpentine above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of andesite fragments in the conglomerates of this part\r\nof the coast varies, but is generally much lower than that of the rocks\r\nfrom the Highlands. Thus at Johnshaven, out of 100 blocks, broken\r\npromiscuously from the conglomerate, I found that only 8 per cent were\r\nof andesite, while 44 per cent were of quartzite, and the remainder\r\nconsisted of various quartz-porphyries, granites and schists. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that some area of crystalline rocks was subjected\r\nto enormous waste, and that its detritus was strewn over the floor of\r\nLake Caledonia, at the same time that from the Montrose volcanic vents\r\nmany streams of andesitic lava were poured forth.\r\n\r\nA vast mass of coarse conglomerate intervenes between Gourdon and\r\nDunnottar, and forms a nearly continuous line of precipices which in\r\nsome places rise 200 feet above the waves. The bedding is everywhere\r\ndistinctly marked, so that there is no difficulty in following the\r\nsuccession of the strata, and estimating their thickness. From the\r\nlast of the lavas at Gourdon to the base of the conglomerates near\r\nStonehaven, there lies an accumulation of conglomerate at least 8000\r\nfeet thick. The boulders and pebbles in these deposits are generally\r\nwell-rounded, and vary up to four feet or more in length. I observed\r\none of quartz-porphyry at Kinneff which measured seven feet long\r\nand six feet broad. The proportion of andesite fragments in these\r\nconglomerates continues to be small. I ascertained that in the coarsest\r\nmass at Kinneff they numbered only 14 per cent; at Todhead Point, a\r\nmile and a half to the north, 20 per cent, and at Caterline, three\r\nquarters of a mile further in the same direction, 21 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this gigantic accumulation of the very coarsest\r\nwater-worn detritus, there are still records of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic action. Near Kinneff the beautiful andesite, with large\r\ntabular crystals of plagioclase, alluded to on p. 274, occurs in the\r\nconglomerate.[352] South of Caterline two flows, lying still lower in\r\nthe system, project into the sea. One of these presents a section of\r\nmuch interest. It shows a central solid portion, jointed into rudely\r\nprismatic blocks, with an indefinite platy structure, which gives it a\r\nroughly-bedded aspect. Its upper ten or twelve feet are sharply marked\r\noff by their slaggy structure, ending upwards in a wavy surface like\r\nthat of the Vesuvian lava of 1858. Into its fissures, steam-cavities\r\nand irregular hollows, fine sand has been washed from above, as at Red\r\nHead, while immediately above it comes a coarse conglomerate of the\r\nusual character (Fig. 76). Still lower down, beneath some 900 feet of\r\nremarkably coarse conglomerate, another group of sheets of andesite\r\nabuts at Crawton upon the coast, with which, at a short distance\r\ninland, it runs parallel for more than two miles, coming back to the\r\nsea at Thornyhive Bay and at Maidenkaim. We have then to pass over\r\nabout 5000 feet of similar conglomerates, until, after having crossed\r\nseveral intercalated sheets of andesite, we meet with the last and\r\nlowest of the whole volcanic series of this region in the form of some\r\nbands of porphyrite at the Bellman's Head, Stonehaven. The peculiar\r\ngeographical conditions that led to the formation of the coarse\r\nconglomerates appear to have been established at the same time that the\r\nvolcanic eruptions began, for as we descend in the long coast section,\r\nwe find that the coarse sediment and the intercalated lavas cease on\r\nthe same general horizon. Below that platform lie some 5000 feet of red\r\nsandstones and red shales, yet the base of the series is not seen, for\r\nthe lowest visible strata have been faulted against the schists of the\r\nHighlands. It is thus obvious that more than 5000 feet of sediment had\r\nbeen laid down over this part of the floor of Lake Caledonia before the\r\nfirst lavas were here erupted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: For an analysis of the felspar in this rock, see Prof.\r\nHeddle's paper, _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxviii. (1879), p. 257.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Andesite with sandstone veinings and overlying\r\nconglomerate. Todhead, south of Caterline, coast of Kincardineshire.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Sidlaw and Ochil Group_\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes which poured out the masses of material that now form\r\nthe chain of the Ochil and Sidlaw Hills appear to have been among the\r\nmost vigorous in the whole region of Lake Caledonia. Their chief vents\r\nprobably lay towards the south-west in the neighbourhood of Stirling,\r\nwhere the lavas, agglomerates and tuffs discharged from them reach a\r\nthickness of not less than 6500 feet, without revealing their bottom.\r\nFrom that centre the lavas range continuously for nearly fifty miles\r\nto the north-east, until they reach the sea at Tayport; but they are\r\nprolonged on the north side of the Firth of Tay from Broughty Ferry\r\nto near Arbroath, so as to overlap those of the Montrose group. They\r\nthus attain a total length of nearly sixty miles in a north-easterly\r\nline. How far they stretched south-west cannot now be ascertained,\r\nfor they have been dislocated and buried in that direction under the\r\nCarboniferous formations of the Midland Valley.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from the map (No. III.) that the great volcanic\r\nridge of the Ochil Hills continues unbroken for twenty-two miles, from\r\nStirling to Bridge of Earn. Thereafter it branches into two divergent\r\nportions, one of which runs on through the north of Fife to the\r\nsouthern promontory of the estuary of the Tay, while the other, after\r\nsinking below the alluvial plains of the Earn and the Tay, mounts once\r\nmore into a high ridge near Perth, and thence stretches eastward into\r\nForfarshire as the chain of the Sidlaw Hills. This bifurcation is due\r\nto the opening out and denudation of the great anticlinal fold above\r\nmentioned. The rocks in the northern limb dip north-westward, those in\r\nthe southern limb dip south-eastward. The lower members of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, underlying the volcanic series, ought to be seen beneath\r\nthem along the crest of the anticline. Unfortunately, however, partly\r\nby the action of faults along the boundaries of the volcanic bands, but\r\nchiefly from the unconformable overspread of Upper Old Red Sandstone\r\nand Lower Carboniferous rocks across the plains of the Carse of Gowrie\r\nand of the Earn, the lower parts of the system are there concealed (see\r\nFig. 78). As already remarked, this important anticlinal fold runs\r\nto the north-east across Forfarshire, and passes out to sea north of\r\nMontrose.\r\n\r\nThrough the Ochil chain the fold runs obliquely in a south-westerly\r\ndirection, until it is truncated by the great fault which lets down the\r\nClackmannan coal-field. The total traceable length of this anticline\r\nis thus about sixty miles. It flattens down towards the south-west;\r\nconsequently the rocks in the western part of the Ochil Hills are so\r\ngently inclined that the same bands may be followed winding round the\r\nsides of the valleys, and giving to the steep declivities the terraced\r\ncontours to which allusion has already been made (see Fig. 68). Another\r\nresult of this structure is that the base of the volcanic series is\r\nentirely concealed by its higher portions.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the map it will be further obvious that the\r\nwhole wide plain of Strathmore--that is the great hollow, more than 80\r\nmiles long and about ten or twelve miles broad, which stretches between\r\nthe base of the Highland mountains and the north-western slopes of the\r\nOchil and Sidlaw chain--is underlain with volcanic rocks of Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone age. This plain lies on a broad synclinal fold, along\r\nthe south-east side of which the lavas, tuffs and conglomerates of the\r\nOchil and Sidlaw Hills dip under a thick accumulation of red sandstone\r\nand flagstone. On the north-west side similar lavas and tuffs rise\r\nagain to the surface, both on the southern side of the great boundary\r\nfaults, and also in the little bays which here and there survive on the\r\nnorthern side of the dislocations (Fig. 77). I have already alluded to\r\nthese interesting relics of the shore-line of Lake Caledonia, and to\r\nthe fact that though they lie unconformably on the Highland schists,\r\nthey do not belong to the actual basement members of the Old Red\r\nSandstone (_ante_, p. 295, and Fig. 73). We have seen that below the\r\nbottom of the volcanic series a thickness of 5000 feet of sandstones\r\nand shales emerges on the Stonehaven coast, and yet that even there the\r\nbase of the whole system is not visible, owing to the effect of the\r\nHighland boundary fault.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that over the bottom of Lake Caledonia a very thick\r\ndeposit of tolerably fine sedimentary material was spread before the\r\ncommencement of the Ochil and Sidlaw eruptions,--that when the lavas\r\nwere poured out and the coarse conglomerates began to be formed, these\r\nmaterials overlapped the older deposits and gradually encroached upon\r\nthe subsiding area of the Highlands. The lavas rolled across the floor\r\nof the lake and entered the successive bays of the northern coast-line,\r\nwhere their outlying patches may still be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Section across the Boundary-fault of the\r\nHighlands at Glen Turrit, Perthshire. _s_, Crystalline schists of\r\nthe Highlands; _c_ _c_, conglomerates and sandstones (Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone) with interstratified volcanic rocks (_v_ _v_); _f_, fault.]\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is clear that to the actually visible area of\r\nvolcanic material in the Ochil and Sidlaw region, and to the anticlinal\r\ntract whence the andesites have been removed by denudation, we have\r\nto add the area that lies under the plain of Strathmore, which may be\r\ncomputed to be at least 800 square miles, making a total of probably\r\nnot less than 1300 square miles. But it will be remembered that\r\npractically only one side of the anticlinal fold is accessible to\r\nobservation. We cannot tell how far in a southerly direction the lavas\r\nof the Ochil Hills may extend. It is quite possible that not a half of\r\nthe total area covered by the eruptions of this volcanic group is now\r\nwithin reach, either of observation or of well-founded inference.\r\n\r\nOne further general characteristic of this volcanic district will be\r\nobvious from an inspection of the map. While the thickest mass of lavas\r\nand tuffs, lying towards the south-west, points to the existence of\r\nthe most active vents in that part of the area, the actual positions\r\nof these vents have not been detected. Probably they lie somewhere to\r\nthe south of the edge of the Ochil chain, under the tract which is\r\noverspread with the coal-field. But other and possibly minor orifices\r\nof eruption appear to have risen at irregular intervals towards the\r\nnorth-east along the length of the lake. Thus there are numerous bosses\r\nof felsitic and andesitic rocks among the central Ochils, some of\r\nwhich may mark the positions of active vents. For some miles to the\r\neast of that area an interval occurs, marked by the presence of only\r\na few small intrusive masses. But as the broad anticline of the Firth\r\nof Tay opens out and allows the lower or pre-volcanic members of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone to approach the surface, another group of bosses\r\nemerges from the lower sandstones and flagstones. Some of these cover\r\na considerable space at the surface, though a portion of their visible\r\narea may be due to lateral extravasation from adjacent pipes, the\r\ntrue dimensions of which are thereby obscured. Some of the masses are\r\nundoubtedly sills. In the case of Dundee Law we probably see both the\r\npipe and the sill which proceeded from it; the prominent, well-defined\r\nhill marking the former, while the band of rock which stretches from\r\nit south-westwards to the shore belongs to the latter. The material\r\nthat forms the bosses and sills in this neighbourhood is generally a\r\ndark compact andesite. The rock of Dundee Law was found by Dr. Hatch\r\nto show under the microscope \"striped lath-shaped felspars abundantly\r\nimbedded in a finely granular groundmass, speckled with granules of\r\nmagnetite, but showing no unaltered ferro-magnesian constituents.\" Here\r\nand there in the same district a solitary neck may be observed filled\r\nwith agglomerate (Fig. 78).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Section across the chain of the Sidlaw Hills,\r\nnear Kilspindie.\r\n\r\n1. Lower Old Red Flagstones and Sandstones; 2. Andesite lavas; 3.\r\nVolcanic tuff; 4. Volcanic conglomerates and sandstones; N, Volcanic\r\nneck; 5. Upper Old Red Sandstone under Carse of Gowrie, lying\r\nunconformably on the lower division; _f_, Fault; _d_, Basic dyke.]\r\n\r\nThe variations in the structure of the Ochil and Sidlaw volcanic group\r\nwill be most easily understood from a series of parallel sections.\r\nBeginning on the north-eastern or Sidlaw branch of the volcanic\r\nband, we find the arrangement of the rocks to be as is shown in the\r\naccompanying figure[353] (Fig. 78). As is usually the case in this\r\nregion, the base of the volcanic series is here concealed by the fault\r\nwhich brings down the Upper Old Red Sandstone under the alluvial\r\ndeposits of the Carse of Gowrie. The total thickness of the series\r\nin this section is about 2500 feet. The rocks consist of successive\r\nsheets of andesite of the familiar types, varying in colour through\r\nshades of blue, purple and red, and in texture from a dull compact\r\nalmost felsitic character to more coarsely crystalline varieties. They\r\nare often amygdaloidal, especially in the upper and lower portions\r\nof the individual flows. They are not infrequently separated from\r\neach other by courses of conglomerate or ashy sandstone and grit. Of\r\nthese intercalations four are of sufficient thickness and persistence\r\nto be mapped, and are shown on the Geological Survey Sheet 48. The\r\nstones in the conglomerates vary up to blocks two feet in diameter,\r\nand consist chiefly of andesites, but include also some pink felsites\r\nand pieces of greenish hardened sandstone. Generally they are more or\r\nless well-rounded; but occasionally they become angular like those of\r\nvolcanic agglomerates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: This section and the notes accompanying it have been\r\nsupplied by Prof. James Geikie, who mapped the western half of the\r\nSidlaw range for the Geological Survey. The eastern half was mapped by\r\nthe late Mr. H. M. Skae.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features in this section is the neck which\r\nat Over Durdie rises through the volcanic series. Oval in form, it\r\nmeasures 630 yards in one diameter and 350 in another, and is filled\r\nwith pinkish granular tuff, full of andesitic lapilli and blocks. A\r\nmuch smaller neck of similar material lies about 100 yards further to\r\nthe south-west. There seems no reason to doubt that these necks mark\r\ntwo of the volcanic vents belonging to a late part of the volcanic\r\nhistory of the district.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Sidlaw range is repeated among the hills of east\r\nFife on the southern side of the great anticlinal fold.[354] Thus\r\na section from near Newburgh on the Firth of Tay southward to near\r\nAuchtermuchty in Stratheden gives the arrangement of rocks shown in\r\nFig. 79. In this traverse a thick mass of fragmental material occurs\r\nin the higher part of the series of volcanic rocks. Though on the\r\nwhole stratified and forming a group of conglomerate-beds between the\r\nlavas, the material is in places an amorphous agglomerate of volcanic\r\nblocks varying in size up to two feet in diameter. These portions show\r\nabundant angular and subangular blocks, many of which, after having\r\nundergone some attrition, have been finally broken across before\r\nreaching their present resting-places. Sharply fractured surfaces can\r\nbe picked out of the felspathic ashy matrix. The stones are chiefly\r\nvarieties of andesite, but they include also pink felsites and pieces\r\nof some older fine-grained tuff.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: The eastern part of the Ochils was mapped for the\r\nGeological Survey by Mr. H. H. Howell and Mr. B. N. Peach.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Section across the Eastern Ochil Hills from\r\nnear Newburgh to near Auchtermuchty.\r\n\r\n1. Lower Old Red Sandstones and conglomerates; 2. Andesite lavas; 3.\r\nVolcanic conglomerates; 4. Upper Old Red Sandstone.]\r\n\r\nThese fragmental materials form a local deposit about nine miles\r\nlong, and probably not less than 1700 feet thick. They are partly\r\ninterstratified with flows of andesite. Though, from the rounded forms\r\nof some of the pebbles, wave-action may be inferred to have been\r\nconcerned in their accumulation, they seem to be mainly due to volcanic\r\nexplosions. No trace, however, has been found of the vent from which\r\nthe eruptions took place. Not improbably its site lies somewhere to the\r\nsouth in the area now concealed under the Upper Old Red Sandstone and\r\nCarboniferous formations. The large size of many of the blocks suggests\r\nthat they do not lie far from their parent focus of discharge. It is\r\nimpossible to tell how much of the volcanic series is here concealed by\r\nthe unconformable overlap of the younger formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Generalized section across the heart of the\r\nOchil Hills, from Dunning on the north to the Fife Coal-field near\r\nSaline on the south.\r\n\r\n1.

At the north end the\r\nvolcanic series is found to be gradually split up into separate\r\nlava-sheets until it dips under the red sandstones of Strathearn.\r\nTraced southwards the rocks become entirely volcanic. Some of their\r\nmost conspicuous and interesting members are pale felsitic tuffs, which\r\noccupy a considerable tract of ground about Craig Rossie, south-east of\r\nAuchterarder. As the dip gradually lessens the harder lavas are able\r\nto spread over wider tracts of ground, capping the hills and ridges,\r\nwhile underneath them thick masses of tuff and conglomerate are laid\r\nbare in the valleys. A number of bosses of orthophyre rise through\r\nthese rocks and are accompanied by many veins and dykes of similar\r\nmaterial. It is not improbable that some of these bosses, as already\r\nsuggested, may represent vents. They are especially prominent among\r\nthe hills due south of Auchterarder. One of these eminences, known as\r\nthe Black Maller, is composed of a typical orthoclase-felsite without\r\nmica. Another, about four and a half miles further south, forms the\r\nconspicuous summit of Ben Shee overlooking Glen Devon, and consists of\r\na similar rock with a characteristic platy structure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: The central portion of the Ochils was mapped for the\r\nGeological Survey by Mr. B. N. Peach, Prof. James Geikie, Prof. J.\r\nYoung, Mr. R. L. Jack and myself.]\r\n\r\nNo necks of agglomerate have been observed in this part of the chain.\r\nIt will be seen from the section that the lowest visible parts of the\r\nOchil volcanic series are here truncated by a fault which brings in\r\nthe lower part of the Carboniferous system. By a curious conjuncture,\r\nimmediately on the south side of this fault, a band of tuff appears,\r\nlying on the platform of the Carboniferous \"plateau-lavas,\" to be\r\nhereafter considered, and passing below the well-known Hurlet seam\r\nof the Carboniferous Limestone, while through these strata rises one\r\nof the puys belonging to the second phase of volcanic activity in\r\nCarboniferous time in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe best sections to show the nature and sequence of the volcanic\r\nseries of the Ochil Hills are to be observed at the west end of the\r\nchain. But as the whole succession of rocks cannot conveniently be\r\nobtained along one line, it is better to make several traverses,\r\nstarting in each case from a known horizon. In this way, by means\r\nof three parallel sections, we may obtain the whole series of lavas\r\nand tuffs in continuous order. The first line of section starts in\r\nthe lowest part of the tuffs represented at the bottom of the group\r\nin Fig. 80, and runs up to the first thick ashy intercalation among\r\nthe lavas. Following this bed south-westward to the Burn of Sorrow,\r\nwe make from that horizon a second traverse across the strike to the\r\nsummit of King's Seat Hill (2111 feet above the sea), where we meet\r\nwith a well-marked lava which can be traced south-westwards, gradually\r\ndescending the southern escarpment of the hills until it reaches the\r\nboundary fault near the village of Menstrie. Starting again from this\r\ndefinite horizon, we take a third line across the top of Dumyat (1373\r\nfeet) to the plain of Sheriffmuir, and there pass beyond the volcanic\r\nseries into the overlying red sandstones. Arranged thus in continuous\r\nvertical sequence the succession is found to be as represented in Fig.\r\n81. The total thickness of volcanic material amounts to more than 6500\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Diagram of the volcanic series of the Western\r\nOchil Hills.\r\n\r\nThe bands with vertical lines are various lavas (_a_); the tuffs and\r\nvolcanic breccias are shown by the dotted bands (_b_); the uppermost\r\nportion of the section above the last thick group of lavas consists of\r\nconglomerates and sandstones (_c_) with a sheet of lava.]\r\n\r\nIn this vast pile of volcanic ejections the lavas are almost entirely\r\nandesites of the usual characters. They include many slaggy and\r\namygdaloidal varieties, some beautiful porphyries with large tabular\r\nfelspars, likewise the resinous or glassy variety already referred to\r\nas occurring above Airthrey Castle. Their upper and under surfaces show\r\nthe same structure as already described in those of the coast-sections\r\nin the Montrose tract. They include also more acid lavas, like the pale\r\npink decomposing felsites of the Pentland Hills.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs and conglomerates occur on many platforms throughout the\r\nsuccession of lava-sheets. They form the lowest visible part of the\r\nwhole volcanic series, but they are most abundant towards the top, and\r\nare best displayed at the western end of the hills. In Dumyat they form\r\na conspicuous feature. The whole of that hill consists of a constant\r\nalternation of lavas (chiefly slaggy andesites, but including also\r\none felsitic flow) with bands of coarse and finer tuff and volcanic\r\nconglomerate. The greatest continuous mass of this fragmental material\r\nis 600 or 700 feet thick. From the extraordinary size of its included\r\nblocks it obviously must have been formed of ashes, stones and huge\r\npieces of lava ejected from some vent in the near neighbourhood. Some\r\nof the individual blocks in this mass are as large as a Highland\r\ncrofter's cottage.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost lavas of Dumyat dip under a still higher series of\r\ncoarse volcanic conglomerates entirely made up of andesitic debris and\r\nreaching a thickness of about 1000 feet. This enormous accumulation was\r\nprobably due partly to the abrasion of exposed cones and lava-ridges,\r\nand partly to volcanic discharges of fragmentary materials. Yet it is\r\nworthy of note that even amidst these evidences of the most vigorous\r\nvolcanic activity we have also proofs of quiet sedimentation and traces\r\nof the fishes that lived in the waters of the lake. This particular\r\nzone of coarse conglomerate as it extends in a south-westerly direction\r\nbecomes finer, and its upper part passes into a chocolate-coloured\r\nsandstone which has been quarried at Wolfe's Hole, Westerton, Bridge\r\nof Allan, at a distance of about three miles from where the line of\r\nsection runs, which is embodied in the diagram, Fig. 81. It was from\r\nthis locality that the specimens of _Eucephalaspis_, _Pteraspis_ and\r\n_Scaphaspis_ were obtained which were described by Professor Ray\r\nLankester.[356]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: _Palæontographical Society_, vols. xxi. (1867) and\r\nxxiii. (1869).]\r\n\r\nAbove the last-named thick group of coarse volcanic conglomerates a\r\nsolitary sheet of dark slaggy andesite may be observed. This lava\r\nis then overlain by the great depth of chocolate-coloured and red\r\nsandstones and marls of the plain of Strathmore (_c_ in Fig. 81).\r\nNevertheless a few hundred feet up in these sedimentary deposits we\r\nmeet with yet one further thin sheet of lava--the last known eruption\r\nof the long volcanic history of this district.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Ochil range I may refer to the evidence there\r\nobtainable as to the horizontal extent of separate sheets of lava. The\r\nwestern end of this range affords great facilities for following out\r\nindividual beds of andesite along the bare terraced front of the great\r\nescarpment. Thus, the easily recognizable porphyrite which caps King's\r\nSeat Hill, above Tillicoultry (see Fig. 68), can be traced winding\r\nalong the hill-slopes until it descends to the plain, and is then lost\r\nunder the great fault, at the foot of Dumyat--a distance of more than\r\nsix miles. There is, therefore, no difficulty in supposing that from\r\nthe Ochil line of vents streams of lava should have rolled along the\r\nfloor of the lake across to the base of the Highland slopes, 10 or 12\r\nmiles distant. We cannot tell, of course, whether any buried vents lie\r\nbelow the plain of Strathmore, but certainly no unquestionable trace of\r\nvents has yet been found among the crystalline rocks along the borders\r\nof the Highlands.[357]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: Allusion has already been made to the possible\r\nconnection of the younger Highland granites with the volcanic series\r\nof the north-eastern part of Lake Caledonia; also to the occurrence of\r\nisolated masses of breccia piercing the crystalline schists near Loch\r\nLomond (_ante_, p. 272).]\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the comparative scarcity of sills\r\nin this region, and to the occurrence of the acid group of Lintrathen\r\nporphyry and the more basic sheets between the Firth of Tay and Forfar.\r\nThis scarcity no doubt arises in part from the extent to which the\r\nrocks that underlie the volcanic series are concealed. Yet it is\r\nnoteworthy that along the coast-section of these rocks near Stonehaven\r\nhardly any intrusive sheets are to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _The Arran and Cantyre Centre_\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the Ochil chain should be broken across and\r\nburied under younger formations at the very place where some of the\r\nmost interesting vents in the whole area of the Old Red Sandstone might\r\nhave been looked for.[358] We have to pass westwards across the Firth\r\nof Clyde to the Isle of Arran before we again meet with rocks of the\r\nsame age and character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: The Ochil area is not the only example of the abrupt\r\ntermination of a volcanic band near its centre owing to faults or\r\noverlaps. The sudden disappearance of the Pentland lavas and tuffs on\r\nthe northern side of the Braid Hills is another striking illustration.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the recent work of the Geological Survey in that\r\nisland, Mr. W. Gunn has discovered that the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nincludes some interstratified volcanic rocks on the north side of\r\nNorth Glen Sannox, and he has supplied me with the following notes\r\nregarding them. \"The area in which the volcanic intercalations occur\r\nis much faulted and only a part of it has been mapped in detail, but\r\nthe position of the interbedded igneous rocks is quite clear. The Old\r\nRed Sandstone here consists of three distinct members, the lowest of\r\nwhich is made up of coarse, well-rounded conglomerates, alternating\r\nwith sandstones and purple mudstones. Above this, and apparently\r\nunconformable to it, is a middle series of light coloured conglomerates\r\nand sandstones, the pebbles in which are mainly of quartz. Finally\r\ncomes an upper series of red sandstones and conglomerates, which\r\noccupy nearly the whole of the coast section, and it is this series\r\nwhich has generally been taken as the typical Old Red Sandstone of the\r\nisland. The volcanic series is intercalated between the middle and\r\nupper divisions given above, and may be seen in several places on the\r\nhillside between the shepherd's house at North Sannox and Laggan. It\r\nconsists mainly of old lava-beds of a dull reddish or purplish colour,\r\noften soft, and in places much decomposed. It seems basic in character.\r\nA specimen from near the Fallen Rocks, examined by Mr. Teall, was found\r\nto be too much altered for precise determination, but was probably a\r\nbasalt originally. These rocks do not occur on the coast.\"\r\n\r\nIn the southern extremity of Cantyre some important relics of the\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Lower Old Red Sandstone have been recently\r\ndetected and mapped for the Geological Survey by Mr. R. G. Symes.[359]\r\nThis division of the system has been ascertained by him to be\r\nextensively developed to the south of Campbeltown, and to include some\r\nsmall but interesting remains of the volcanic action which was so\r\nmarked a feature in the areas of Lake Caledonia, lying further to the\r\neast. To the student of volcanic geology, indeed, this small tract at\r\nthe extreme southern end of Argyllshire has a peculiar interest, for in\r\nno other part of the British Isles have the phenomena of the eruptive\r\nvents of the Lower Old Red Sandstone been more admirably laid bare. Not\r\nonly are there necks in the interior like that represented in Fig. 82;\r\nbut others have been dissected by the waves along the southern shore,\r\nand their relations to the deposits of fragmentary material showered\r\nover the bottom of the lake have been more or less clearly exposed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: The late Prof. James Nicol published in 1852 an account\r\nof the geology of the southern portion of Cantyre. He grouped all the\r\nigneous rocks of the district as one series, which he regarded as later\r\nthan the Coal-formation and possibly of the same age as those of the\r\nnorth-east of Ireland. He made no distinction between the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone and the younger unconformable conglomerates (_Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. viii. (1852), p. 406).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--View of Cnoc Garbh, Southend, Campbeltown. A\r\nvolcanic neck of Lower Old Red Sandstone age, about 400 yards wide in\r\nits longer diameter.]\r\n\r\nAt Keil Point, a little to the east of the most southerly headland\r\nof the Mull of Cantyre, some reddish and purplish highly felspathic\r\nsandstones (_a_ in Fig. 83) dipping towards the east are found to pass\r\nupward into coarse volcanic breccias (_b_), which, followed eastwards,\r\nlose almost all trace of stratification, and are then abruptly\r\nsucceeded by a neck of coarse agglomerate (_c_) measuring 25 yards\r\nfrom north to south, where its limits can be seen, and at least 12\r\nyards from west to east. It is hardly possible to distinguish between\r\nthe breccias to the west and the agglomerate of the neck, except by\r\nthe rude bedding of the former which pass down into the well-bedded\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate is a thoroughly volcanic rock. The materials consist\r\nchiefly of angular blocks of a pale purplish or lilac highly\r\nporphyritic mica-porphyrite, with large white felspars and hexagonal\r\ntables of black mica. These blocks might sometimes be mistaken for\r\nslags from their cavernous, weathered surfaces, but this rough aspect\r\nis found on examination to be due to the decay of their felspars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Section of volcanic series on beach, Southend,\r\nCampbeltown.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Fine reddish and purplish highly felspathic sandstones,\r\n     largely composed of porphyry-debris and passing up into coarse\r\n     breccias; _b_, volcanic breccias, coarse and only rudely\r\n     stratified, formed of blocks of porphyry, sandstone fine tuff\r\n     and andesite, together with water-worn quartzite pebbles derived\r\n     from some conglomerate; _c_, coarse unstratified agglomerate\r\n     forming a neck.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most singular feature among the contents of this neck\r\nis the number of well-rounded and smoothed pebbles and boulders of\r\nquartzite. These are dispersed at random through the mass, and are\r\noften placed on end. There can be no doubt that they are water-worn\r\nstones, but the contrast of their smooth surfaces and rounded forms\r\nwith the rough angular blocks of igneous material is so striking as\r\nto lead at once to the conclusion that they cannot have acquired\r\ntheir water-worn character in the deposit where they now lie. Their\r\npositions and their occurrence with ejected volcanic blocks suggest\r\nthat they too were discharged by volcanic explosions. They so exactly\r\nresemble the quartzite boulders and pebbles in the neighbouring Old Red\r\nConglomerates that there can be little hesitation in regarding them as\r\nderived from these conglomerates. They seem to me to have come from a\r\nlower part of the Old Red Sandstone, which was shattered by volcanic\r\nenergy either before the conglomerates were firmly consolidated or\r\nafterwards by such violent explosions as served to separate the pebbles\r\nfrom the matrix of the rock.\r\n\r\nThere occur also in the agglomerate blocks of fine tuff and ashy\r\nsandstone sometimes four feet long, and often stuck on end, showing\r\nthat the deposits of earlier eruptions were broken up during the\r\ndrilling of this little vent.\r\n\r\nA few hundred yards further east a larger neck rises on the beach,\r\nimmediately to the south of the old Celtic chapel of St. Columba. It\r\nconsists also of exceedingly coarse agglomerate, with andesite blocks\r\nthree and four yards in diameter. It is about 125 yards broad from east\r\nto west, on which sides it is seen to be flanked by coarse volcanic\r\nbreccias and conglomerates, resembling in composition the materials\r\nof the neck, but showing an increasingly definite stratification as\r\nthey are traced eastward in the ascending succession of deposits.\r\nFollowing the section in still the same easterly direction along\r\nthe coast, we find that bands of fine felspathic sandstone, marking\r\nprobably intervals of quiescence, are again and again succeeded by\r\ncoarse brecciated conglomerates of igneous materials, which may be\r\ninferred to have been due to a renewal of violent eruptions. By degrees\r\nthe evidence of stratification and of attrition among the volcanic\r\nmaterials becomes more pronounced as the ascending section is followed;\r\nblocks of andesite, even 18 inches or two feet in diameter, assume\r\nwell-rolled, rounded, water-worn forms, like the pebbles of quartzite\r\nassociated with them, and eventually the strata return to the usual\r\naspect of the conglomerates of the district.\r\n\r\nI have never seen anywhere better proofs of volcanic explosions,\r\ncontemporaneous with a group of strata, and of the distribution of\r\nvolcanic fragmentary material round the vents. A further point of much\r\ninterest is the additional evidence furnished by this shore-section\r\nof considerable wave-action during the accumulation of the coarse\r\nconglomerates. To give to blocks of porphyrite two feet in diameter a\r\nsmoothed and rounded form must have required the action of water in\r\nconsiderable agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _The Ulster Centres_\r\n\r\nFrom the volcanic breccias and conglomerates of the Mull of Cantyre\r\nto the coast of Antrim in a straight line is a distance of little\r\nmore than twenty miles. On a clear day the Old Red Sandstone of Cross\r\nSlieve, and the range of cliffs in which it abruptly descends to the\r\nsea between Cushendall and Cushendun, can be distinctly seen from the\r\nArgyllshire shore. The geologist who passes from the Scottish to the\r\nIrish sections cannot fail to be impressed with the resemblance of the\r\nrocks in the two countries, and with the persistence of the types of\r\nconglomerate in Lake Caledonia.\r\n\r\nA picturesque section has been laid bare between the Coastguard Station\r\nsouth of Cushendall and Cushendun Bay.[360] At the south side of the\r\nlittle inlet of Cushendall, a compact dull quartz-porphyry is exposed\r\nin crags along the shore. This rock ranges in colour from dark brown\r\nand purple to pale-green and buff. Its texture also varies, as well as\r\nthe proportion of its felspar-crystals and quartz-blebs. Some parts\r\nhave a cavernous structure, like that of an amygdaloid, the small\r\nglobular cavities being filled with green decomposition products.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: For descriptions of this district see J. Bryce, _Proc.\r\nGeol. Soc._ i. (1834) p. 396, v. (1837) p. 69; J. Kelly, _Proc. Roy.\r\nIrish Acad._ x. (1868), p. 239. The area is contained in Sheet 14 of\r\nthe Geological Survey of Ireland, and was mapped by Mr. A. M'Henry and\r\ndescribed by him in the accompanying Explanatory Memoir (1886), pp. 12,\r\n25.]\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphical relations of this rock are not quite clear, but\r\nit is certainly older than the Old Red conglomerates which lie to\r\nthe north of it, for these are largely made up of its fragments. The\r\nmatrix of these detrital masses consists mainly of the comminuted\r\ndebris of the porphyry. The pebbles include all the varieties of that\r\nrock, and are tolerably well-rounded. There is no distinct evidence\r\nof volcanic action among these conglomerates. They resemble, however,\r\nmany of the conglomerates in the Midland Valley of Scotland, which,\r\nas in the case of those on the Forfarshire and Kincardineshire coast,\r\nare in great part made of the detritus of andesitic lavas. The\r\nCushendall rocks become coarser as they are traced northwards into\r\nlower members of the series, while at the same time the proportion of\r\nporphyry-debris in their constitution diminishes, and materials from\r\nthe metamorphic series take its place. Thus at Cushendun the percentage\r\nof quartz-pebbles rises to 70 or 80. These blocks, of all sizes up to\r\ntwo feet or more in diameter, are admirably rounded and smoothed, like\r\nthose in the Stonehaven section and those among the conglomerates at\r\nthe south end of Cantyre. Fragments of the porphyry, however, still\r\ncontinue to appear, and the matrix shows an admixture of the finer\r\ndetritus of that rock. I may remark in passing that no conglomerates\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone show more strikingly than these at Cushendun\r\nthe effects of mechanical crushing subsequent to deposition and\r\nconsolidation. In many parts of the rock it is hardly possible to find\r\na rounded block that has not been fractured. Some of them, indeed, may\r\nbe seen cut into half a dozen slices, which have been pushed over each\r\nother under the strain of strong lateral or vertical pressure.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the country, after passing over the broad Tertiary\r\nbasaltic plateau of Antrim, we come upon a large area of Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone in Tyrone. It stretches from Pomeroy to Loch Erne, a distance\r\nof about 30 miles, and is about 12 miles broad. In lithological\r\ncharacter the strata of this tract exactly resemble parts of the\r\ndeposits of Lake Caledonia in Central Scotland. They include also a\r\nvolcanic series which, down to the smallest points of detail, may\r\nbe paralleled in the sister island.[361] This interesting westward\r\nprolongation of the volcanic record consists of a number of outlying\r\npatches confined to the eastern part of the district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: This area of Old Red Sandstone is represented on Sheets\r\n33, 34, 45 and 46 of the Geological Survey of Ireland, and the igneous\r\nrocks are described in the Memoirs on Sheets 33 (1886, p. 17) by Mr. J.\r\nR. Kilroe, and 34 (1878, p. 16) by Mr. J. Nolan.]\r\n\r\nThe largest of these patches lies to the south of Pomeroy, where it\r\nforms a line of hills about four miles long, and covers an area of\r\nsome five square miles. The rocks consist of successive sheets of\r\nandesite-lavas. These, as a rule, are not markedly cellular, though\r\nthey include some characteristic amygdaloids. A distinguishing\r\nfeature of some of the sheets is their remarkably well-developed\r\nflow-structure. Thus on Sentry Box, at the north-western end of the\r\nridge, the fissility resulting from this structure so perfectly divides\r\nthe rock into parallel flags that the material might easily be mistaken\r\nfor a bedded rock. Where this structure has been produced in a cellular\r\nlava, the cavities have been drawn out and flattened in the direction\r\nof flow.\r\n\r\nI have not observed true tuffs in any of the sections traversed by me\r\nin this district. But the conglomerates furnish abundant evidence of\r\nthe contemporaneous outpouring of the lavas. Thus, in a brook a little\r\nwest of Reclain, five miles south of Pomeroy, the section shown in Fig.\r\n84 may be seen. At the base lies a coarse conglomerate (_a_) largely\r\ncomposed of andesite-debris, the stones being here, as elsewhere in\r\nthe district, well rounded. Then comes a series of green and reddish\r\nhighly-felspathic sandstones (_b_), followed by an exceedingly\r\ncoarse conglomerate (_c_), formed mainly of the debris of andesites,\r\nespecially lumps of slag. Some of the stones measure 18 inches in\r\ndiameter, and all are well water-worn. Immediately over this mass of\r\ndetritus lies the lowest sheet of andesite-lava (_d_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Section of the base of the volcanic series,\r\nReclain, five miles south of Pomeroy.]\r\n\r\nSome sections visible in the neighbourhood of Omagh afford further\r\nevidence of volcanic action at the time of the deposition of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone of this region. At Farm Hill, a little to the east of\r\nthe town, felspathic sandstones and breccias enclose angular and\r\nsubangular pieces of various andesites, and occasionally even pieces\r\nof tuff. Near these strata a decayed andesite occurs in the bed of\r\na stream, and a fresher variety is quarried at Farm Hill. A little\r\nfurther south another variety of andesite is exposed in two quarries\r\nat Recarson Meeting-House--a fine granular purplish-grey rock, with\r\nabundantly-diffused hæmatite pseudomorphs, probably after a pyroxene,\r\nand sometimes strongly amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 85. Section of shales and breccias at Crossna Chapel,\r\n     north-east of Boyle.\r\n\r\n  _a_ _a_, Green and grey shales; _b_ _b_, green and grey hard\r\n     sandstones and grits, some bands strongly felspathic; _c_, fine\r\n     compact felspathic breccia, with angular chips of different\r\n     felsites and andesites, etc.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere can thus be no doubt that this region of Ulster included\r\nseveral centres of volcanic activity during the deposition of the\r\nred sandstones and conglomerates, and that the lavas and volcanic\r\nconglomerates belonged to precisely the same types as those of the same\r\ngeological age which occur so abundantly in Scotland.\r\n\r\nFurther south-west, near Boyle, in the county of Roscommon, certain\r\ncurious felspathic breccias in the Old Red Sandstone have been mapped\r\nas \"felstone.\"[362] So far as I have been able to examine them,\r\nhowever, they are entirely of fragmental origin. They contain pieces\r\nof andesitic and felsitic rocks, with fragments of devitrified glass,\r\nwhich undoubtedly point to the occurrence of volcanic eruptions during\r\ntheir deposition, though no tuffs and lavas appear to crop out in the\r\nnarrow strip of the formation there exposed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: See Sheet 66 Geological Survey of Ireland, and\r\nExplanation to that sheet (1878), p. 15. The rocks were previously\r\ndescribed by Jukes and Foot, _Journ. Roy. Geol. Soc. Ireland_, vol. i.\r\n(1866), p. 249.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying section (Fig. 85) may be seen on the hills to the\r\nnorth-east of Boyle. Where quarried on the road-side to the north of\r\nBoyle, the series of deposits here represented contains a bed of coarse\r\nand exceedingly compact breccia, similar to that just referred to, but\r\ncontaining angular and subangular fragments six or eight inches long.\r\nThe joints of these compact strata are remarkably sharp and clean cut,\r\nso that where the fragmentary character is not very distinct the rocks\r\nmight easily be mistaken on casual inspection for felsites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE LOWER OLD RED SANDSTONE OF \"LAKE\r\nCALEDONIA\"--_continued_\r\n\r\n  The Southern Chain--The Pentland Volcano--The Biggar Centre--The\r\n     Duneaton Centre--The Ayrshire Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to note the leading features of the groups of volcanic\r\nrocks distributed along the southern line of vents already described.\r\nAt least four different centres of eruption may be observed on that\r\nline. Their mutual limits are, on the whole, better seen than those of\r\nthe northern line, for from the north-eastern to the south-western end\r\nof the volcanic belt the Old Red Sandstone and rocks of older date are\r\nalmost continuously exposed at the surface. The encroaching areas of\r\nCarboniferous formations in Lanarkshire and Ayrshire interrupt but do\r\nnot entirely conceal the volcanic tracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SOUTHERN CHAIN OF VOLCANOES IN \"LAKE CALEDONIA\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _The Pentland Volcano_\r\n\r\nBeginning at the north-east end of the line we first come upon\r\nthe classic area of the Pentland Hills, for the study of which\r\nthe geologist is prepared by the admirable description of Charles\r\nMaclaren,[363] and the earlier geognostical papers of Jameson.[364]\r\nThe area mapped in detail is represented in Sheet 32 of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Scotland, published in 1859, and described in the Memoir\r\naccompanying that sheet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: _A Sketch of the Geology of Fife and the Lothians_,\r\n1839. The detailed descriptions in this work are accompanied with a\r\nmap and two plates of sections. In the map all the volcanic rocks are\r\nrepresented by one colour. In the sections the bedding of the rocks\r\nis shown, and an indication is given of the succession of their chief\r\nvarieties.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: See specially _Mem. Wernerian Soc._ vol. ii.; also\r\nMacKnight in vol. i. The account of the Pentland Hills by Hay\r\nCunningham in vol. vii. (1838) is clear but brief.]\r\n\r\nWhen in these early days I surveyed this ground I found it extremely\r\ndifficult to understand. Being then myself but a beginner in geology,\r\nand the study of old volcanic rocks not having yet advanced much beyond\r\nits elementary stage, I failed to disentangle the puzzle. Not until\r\nafter more than twenty years, largely spent in the investigation of\r\nvolcanic rocks elsewhere, had I an opportunity of resurveying the\r\nground and bringing to its renewed study a wider knowledge of the\r\nsubject. A new edition of the map was issued in 1892, and I shall here\r\nembody in my summary the chief results obtained in the course of this\r\nrevision.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious features in the Pentland area are the marked\r\ndevelopment of the volcanic rocks at the north end of the chain,\r\ntheir rapid diminution and disappearance towards the south-west, the\r\nabrupt truncation of the bedded masses by the line of craggy declivity\r\nwhich forms the northern termination of the hills, and lastly, the\r\ncontinuation of the volcanic series northward in a totally different\r\nform in the lower eminences of the Braid Hills.\r\n\r\nThe length of the whole volcanic tract is about eleven miles; its\r\nbreadth at the widest northern part is four miles, but from that\r\nmaximum it dwindles southwards and dies out in seven miles. Its western\r\nside is in large measure flanked by the unconformable overlap of the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone and Lower Carboniferous formations, though\r\nin some places the base of the volcanic series is seen. The eastern\r\nboundary is chiefly formed by a large fault which brings down the\r\nCarboniferous rocks against the volcanic ridge. At the northern end,\r\nthis ridge plunges unconformably under the Upper Old Red Sandstone of\r\nthe southern outskirts of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe bedded aspect of the truncated end of the Pentland chain, as seen\r\nfrom the north, has been already alluded to (p. 281). The rocks dip to\r\nthe south-east, hence the lower members of the series are to be found\r\nalong the north-west side of the hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Section across the north end of the Pentland\r\nHills, from Warklaw Hill to Pentland Mains. Length about five miles.\r\n\r\n  1. Upper Silurian grits and shales, not seen where the line of\r\n     section crosses; 2 2.

Calciferous Sandstones and Carboniferous Limestone series\r\n     brought down against the volcanic series by a fault (_f_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed from the Geological Survey map that the volcanic\r\nrocks of the main body of the Pentland Hills are arranged in\r\nalternations of somewhat basic and more acid bands. The most basic\r\nsheets are some amygdaloidal diabases at the bottom of the whole\r\nseries which make their appearance in Warklaw Hill (Fig. 86). The\r\ngreater number of the dark lavas are varieties of andesite, sometimes\r\ntolerably compact, sometimes highly cellular and amygdaloidal. But\r\ninterstratified with these are thick sheets of what used to be\r\ncalled \"claystone,\" a term which here comprised decayed felsites\r\n(orthophyres), and also felsitic tuffs and breccias. The remarkably\r\nacid nature of some of these rocks has been already pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of the volcanic series at the north end of the\r\nhills is about 7000 feet, but as neither the top nor the bottom is\r\nthere visible, it may be considerably greater. At these maximum\r\ndimensions the rocks form the high scarped front of the Pentland Hills,\r\nwhich rises into so prominent a feature in the southern landscape of\r\nEdinburgh. A series of transverse sections across the chain from north\r\nto south will illustrate its structure and history. These I shall here\r\ndescribe, reserving for subsequent consideration the great vent of the\r\nBraid Hills.\r\n\r\nA section taken through the north end of the chain, where the maximum\r\ndepth of volcanic material is exposed, presents the arrangement\r\nrepresented in Fig. 86. It will be seen that the base of the series is\r\nhere concealed by the unconformable overlap of the Lower Carboniferous\r\nrocks on the west side, while the top is cut off by the great fault\r\nwhich on the east side brings down the Midlothian Coal-field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--View of the lava-escarpments of Warklaw Hill,\r\nPentland chain, from the north-west.]\r\n\r\nThe Lower Carboniferous conglomerates (4) creep over the edge and up\r\nthe slopes of the volcanic series of the Pentland Hills. They contain\r\nabundant pebbles of the lavas, and were evidently laid down along a\r\nshore from which the Pentland rocks rose steeply into land. Though\r\nthe actual base of the lavas is not seen here, two miles further to\r\nthe south highly-inclined Upper Silurian shales and mudstones are\r\nfound emerging unconformably from under the volcanic pile, and similar\r\nstrata probably underlie Warklaw Hill as indicated in the figure.\r\nThe Upper Silurian strata pass up into a lower group of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, which has also been covered unconformably by the\r\nvolcanic series. In these underlying deposits we have evidence of the\r\npre-volcanic accumulations of the lake, which were broken up and tilted\r\nat the beginning of the volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe lowest lavas, consisting of well-marked beds of diabase (2),\r\npresent their escarpments to the north-west and dip into the rising\r\nground, as sketched in Fig. 87. Their characters have been already\r\nnoticed in the general petrography of the Old Red Sandstone volcanic\r\nrocks. Dark solid compact portions of them pass rapidly into coarsely\r\ncellular slag, especially along the upper and under parts of the\r\nseveral sheets. No tuff has been noticed between these basic flows, but\r\nhere and there thin lenticular layers of sandstone, lying in hollows\r\nof the lava-sheets, are connected with vertical or highly-inclined\r\nramifying veins of similar material, with the plains of stratification\r\npassing across the breadth of the veins. These features are an\r\nexact reproduction of those above described in Forfarshire and\r\nKincardineshire. The amygdales consist of chalcedony, crystallized\r\nquartz and calcite.\r\n\r\nTorduff Hill, which rises to the east of Warklaw, consists of a mass of\r\ncoarse volcanic breccia or agglomerate (_n_), markedly felsitic in its\r\nmaterials. It probably forms a neck marking a small volcanic vent, like\r\nsome others at the north end of the chain to be afterwards referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of Capelaw Hill, the next eminence in an easterly\r\ndirection, bedded andesites, with an intercalated band of sandstone and\r\nconglomerate (2_s_), appear and pass under rocks of so decomposing a\r\nkind that no good sections of them are to be found. The hill is covered\r\nwith grass, but among the rubbish of the screes pieces of felsite-like\r\nrocks and breccias may be observed. Some of these blocks show an\r\nalternation of layers of felsitic breccia with a fine felsite-like\r\nmaterial which may be a tuff. These rocks, conspicuous by the light\r\ncolours of their screes, alternate further up with other dark andesitic\r\nlavas, and run south-westward for about five miles.\r\n\r\nBeyond Capelaw Hill, upon a band of these pale rocks, comes a thick\r\ngroup of sheets of dark andesite, which form the main mass of Allermuir\r\nHill. They are well seen from the south side and likewise from the\r\nnorth, dipping towards the south-east at angles of from 35° to 40°, and\r\nweathering along the crest of the hills into a succession of scars and\r\nslopes which show the bedded character of the lavas.\r\n\r\nAt Caerketton Hill another band of pale material forms the conspicuous\r\ncraggy face so familiar in the aspect of the Pentland Hills as seen\r\nfrom Edinburgh. This band consists of pale felsitic breccia, and\r\namorphous, compact, much-decayed rock, regarding which it is difficult\r\nto decide whether it should be considered as a fine felsitic tuff,\r\nor as a decomposed felsite. The band is better seen when traced\r\nsouthwards. The light colour of its screes makes it easily followed by\r\nthe eye even from a distance along the hill-tops and declivities.\r\n\r\nOn the next hill to the south-west, known as Castlelaw Hill, this pale\r\nband of rock is exposed in a few crags and quarries, and its debris,\r\nprotruding through the scanty herbage, slips down the slopes. On its\r\nnorth side the screes display the same felsitic breccias and compact,\r\ndecayed felsitic rocks, occasionally showing a structure like the\r\nflow-structure of rhyolite. The breccia which projects in blocks from\r\nthe summit of the hill has been quarried immediately below the crest on\r\nthe south side, where it overlies a thin intercalated band of a dull,\r\nmuch-decomposed porphyry.\r\n\r\nThe breccias are composed almost entirely of thoroughly acid\r\nrock-fragments, as may be judged from the percentage of silica shown\r\nto occur in them. These fragments vary from the finest lapilli up to\r\nangular pieces several inches long. They not infrequently display a\r\nfine and extremely beautiful flow-structure. It is thus quite certain\r\nthat there are acid breccias intercalated among the more basic lavas\r\nof the northern Pentlands, and that among the constituents of these\r\nbreccias are fragments of felsite or perhaps even lithoid rhyolite.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore be prepared to find that actual outflows of\r\nfelsitic lava accompanied the discharge of these highly-siliceous\r\ntuffs. Unfortunately the manner in which the rocks decay and conceal\r\nthemselves under their own debris makes it difficult to separate the\r\nundoubtedly fragmental bands from those which may be true lavas. But an\r\noccasional opening, and here and there a scattered loose block, serve\r\nto indicate that the two groups of rock certainly do coexist in this\r\npale band, which can be followed through the chain for upwards of six\r\nmiles until it is cut off by the eastern boundary fault.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west end of Castlelaw Hill, where a quarry has been\r\nopened above the Kirk Burn, blocks of felsite may be observed showing\r\nflow-structure on a large scale. The bands of varied devitrification\r\nare sometimes a quarter of an inch broad, and weather out in lighter\r\nand darker tints. Some of them have retained their felsitic texture\r\nbetter than others, which have become more thoroughly kaolinized. That\r\nthese are not deceptive layers of different texture in fine tuffs is\r\nmade quite clear by some characteristic rhyolitic structures. The\r\nbands are not quite parallel, but, on the contrary, are developed\r\nlenticularly, and may be observed to be occasionally puckered, and to\r\nbe even bent back and folded over as in ordinary rhyolites. There is no\r\ncontortion to be observed among the stratified tuffs of the hills. This\r\nirregularity in the layers is obviously original, and can only be due\r\nto the flow of a moving lava.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Castlelaw Hill, as shown in Fig. 86, dull reddish\r\nandesites overlie the pale belt of felsitic rocks. Their lower bands\r\nare marked by the presence of well-formed crystals of a dark green\r\nmica. Their central and higher portions consist of porphyrites of the\r\nprevalent type, both compact and vesicular. These lavas continue as far\r\nas any rock can be seen. Beyond the boundary fault, the Burdiehouse\r\nLimestone and oil-shales of the Lower Carboniferous series are met\r\nwith, inclined at high angles against the hills. It is impossible to\r\nsay how much of the volcanic series has here been removed from sight by\r\nthe dislocation.\r\n\r\nIf now we move three miles further to the south-west and take a second\r\nsection across the Pentland Hills, it will be found to expose the\r\narrangement of rocks represented in Fig. 88. At the western end the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstones (4) and Lower Carboniferous series (5) are\r\nseen lying unconformably on the upturned edges of the Upper Silurian\r\nshales (1). North Black Hill consists of a large intrusive sheet of\r\npale felsite (F) that has broken through the Silurian strata and has\r\nin places thrust itself between them and the conglomerates of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone which lie unconformably upon them. In the\r\nneighbouring Logan Burn, at the bottom of the Habbie's Howe Waterfall,\r\nthe felsite can be seen injected into the conglomerate. The felsitic\r\nsill of North Black Hill runs for a mile and a half along the western\r\nbase of the volcanic series, and has a breadth of about half a mile. It\r\nis the only important intrusive mass in the Pentland Hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Section across the Pentland Hills through\r\nNorth Black Hill and Scald Law (length about three miles).]\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Silurian shales that lie against the southern\r\nflank of North Black Hill, pale felsitic tuffs (3) occur, which are a\r\ncontinuation of those already referred to as running southwards from\r\nCapelaw Hill. Above them a series of andesites (2), with intercalated\r\nbands of tuff, sandstone and conglomerate (2_s_), occupy the bottom\r\nof the Logan valley and part of the slopes on both sides. In the\r\nthickest band of tuffs, which is well-exposed along the road by the\r\nside of the Loganlee Reservoir, a group of well-bedded strata occurs\r\nfrom less than an inch to a foot or more in thickness. Generally\r\nthey are pale in colour, and are made up of white felsitic detritus,\r\nbut with a sprinkling of dull purplish-red fragments, and occasional\r\nlarger rounded pieces of different andesites. Some of the rocks might\r\nbe called felspathic sandstones. Other bands in the group are dark\r\npurplish-red in tint, and consist mainly of andesitic debris, with\r\na dusting of white felsitic grains and fragments. There would thus\r\nseem to have been showers both of felsitic and of andesitic ashes and\r\nlapilli.\r\n\r\nThe dark lavas that overlie the tuffs are likewise well displayed\r\nalong the same road-section. They vary rapidly from extremely compact\r\nhomogeneous dark blue rocks, that weather with a greenish crust, to\r\ncoarse, slaggy masses and amygdaloids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Section from the valley of the Gutterford Burn\r\nthrough Green Law and Braid Law to Eight-Mile Burn.]\r\n\r\nThese more basic lavas are a continuation of those of Allermuir Hill,\r\nand, as at that locality, they plunge here also under the same band\r\nof white tuffs, breccias and felsites (3), which has been referred to\r\nas stretching southward from Caerketton Crags. This band must here\r\nbe at least 500 feet thick. It forms Scald Law (1898 feet) and the\r\nsurrounding summits, and thus occupies the highest elevations in the\r\nPentland chain. It dips beneath the uppermost group of andesites,\r\nwhich, as before, are here truncated by the eastern fault (_f_), the\r\nCalciferous Sandstones and Carboniferous Limestone series (6) being\r\nthrown against them.\r\n\r\nA third section (Fig. 89), taken two miles still further south, shows a\r\nremarkable attenuation of the volcanic series, and the appearance of a\r\nthick group of conglomerates (2) lying conformably below that series,\r\nbut resting on the upturned edges of the upper Silurian shales (1). The\r\nthick Allermuir porphyrites are here reduced to a few thin beds (3)\r\nintercalated among the conglomerates and sandstones, amidst which the\r\nwhole volcanic series dies out southward. A detailed section of the\r\nrocks exposed on the western front of Braid Law shows the following\r\nsuccession:--\r\n\r\n  White felsitic rocks of Braid Law (4 in Fig. 89).\r\n\r\n  Coarse conglomerate passing down into sandstone. About 20 feet\r\n     visible.\r\n\r\n  Dark andesite, 4 feet.\r\n\r\n  Parting of yellow felspathic grit, 8 or 10 inches.\r\n\r\n  Andesite, 10 feet.\r\n\r\n  Hard felspathic grit, 6 feet.\r\n\r\n  Dark green amygdaloidal andesite, 2 feet.\r\n\r\n  Yellow felspathic sandstone and grit, 2 feet.\r\n\r\n  Dark green amygdaloidal andesite, 6 feet.\r\n\r\n  Felspathic grit and red and brown sandstone, 4 feet.\r\n\r\n  Dark andesite, perhaps 6 or 8 feet.\r\n\r\n  Great conglomerate with alternating courses of sandstone, rapidly\r\n     increasing in thickness southwards.\r\n\r\nAbove these dwindling representatives of the northern andesitic lavas\r\ncomes the continuation of the white band of tuffs and breccias of\r\nCaerketton and Scald Law (4), which in turn dips under the highest\r\ngroup of andesites. The Carboniferous strata (5) are brought in by the\r\nfault (_f_). In little more than two miles beyond this line of section\r\nthe volcanic series disappears, and the Old Red Sandstone for a brief\r\nspace consists only of sedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\nBesides the remarkable alternation of basic and acid ejections, there\r\nis a further notable feature in the geology of the Pentland Hills.\r\nThis volcanic centre presents us with one of the most remarkable vents\r\nanywhere to be seen among the volcanic rocks of Britain. The full\r\nsignificance of this feature may best be perceived if we advance along\r\nthe hills from their south-western end. As has now been made clear, the\r\nvolcanic materials which begin about the line of the North Esk near\r\nCarlops rapidly augment in thickness until, in a distance of not more\r\nthan seven miles, they attain a thickness of about 7000 feet, and then\r\nform the great scarped front of the hills that look over Edinburgh. But\r\nat the base of that wall their continuity abruptly ceases. The lower\r\nground, which extends thence to the southern suburbs of Edinburgh, and\r\nincludes the group of the Braid Hills, is occupied by another and more\r\ncomplex group of rocks in which the parallelism and persistence so\r\nmarked in the Pentland chain entirely disappear.\r\n\r\nThis abrupt truncation of the bedded lavas and tuffs marks\r\napproximately the southern margin of a large vent from which at\r\nleast some, if not most, of these rocks were probably ejected. The\r\nsize of this vent cannot be precisely ascertained on account of the\r\nunconformable overspread of Lower Carboniferous strata. But that it\r\nmust have been a large and important volcanic orifice may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that the visible area of the materials that fill it up\r\nmeasures two miles from north-east to south-west, and a mile and a\r\nhalf from south-east to north-west, thus including a space of rather\r\nmore than two square miles. Its original limits towards the north and\r\nsouth can be traced by help of the bedded lavas that partially surround\r\nit, but on the two other sides they are concealed by the younger\r\nformations. We shall probably not over-estimate the original area of\r\nthe vent if we state it at about four square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Section across the north end of the Pentland\r\nHills, and the southern edge of the Braid Hill vent. Length about two\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n1 1. Andesites; 2. Fine tuffs, etc., of the Braid Hill vent; 3 3 3.\r\nAgglomerate in lateral necks with felsitic intrusions (4).]\r\n\r\nThe materials that now fill this important orifice consist mainly of\r\n\"claystones,\" like those of the Pentland series--dull rocks, meagre to\r\nthe touch, varying in texture from the rough porous aspect of a sinter\r\nthrough stages of increasing firmness till they become almost felsitic,\r\nand ranging in colour from a dark purple-red, through shades of lilac\r\nand yellow, to nearly white, but often strikingly mottled. A more or\r\nless laminar structure is often to be observed among them, indicating\r\na dip in various directions (but especially towards the north) and at\r\nconsiderable angles. Throughout this exceedingly fine-grained material,\r\nlines of small lapilli may occasionally be detected, also bands of\r\nbreccia, consisting of broken-up tuff of the same character, and of\r\nfine \"hornstone\" and felsite, with delicate flow-structure. Exhibiting\r\non the whole so little structure, this tract may be regarded as\r\nconsisting largely of fine volcanic dust derived from the explosion of\r\nfelsitic or orthophyric lavas. Some portions indeed are not improbably\r\ncomposed of decayed felsites, like those which present so many\r\ndifficulties to the geologist who would try to trace their course among\r\nthe other lavas and tuffs of the Pentland chain. Various veins, dykes\r\nand small bosses of felsite, andesite and even more basic material,\r\nsuch as fine dolerite, have been intruded into the general body of the\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the main vent some subordinate necks may be\r\nobserved (3, 3 in Fig. 90), perhaps, like Torduff Hill, already\r\nnoticed (Fig. 86), marking lateral eruptions from the flanks of the\r\ngreat cone. Three of these occur in a line more than half a mile long,\r\npossibly indicating a fissure on the side of the old volcano, running\r\nin a south-westerly direction from the southern edge of the vent. The\r\nsmallest of them measures about 500 feet in diameter; the largest is\r\noblong in shape, its shorter diameter being about 500 feet, and its\r\nlonger about 1000 feet. The materials that fill these lateral vents are\r\ncoarse agglomerates, traversed by veins and irregular intrusions of a\r\nfine horny or flinty felsite.\r\n\r\nFrom the acid character of most of the rocks that now fill the wide\r\nvent of the Braid Hills it may be inferred that at least the last\r\neruptions from it consisted chiefly of acid tuffs and lavas. The upper\r\nportion of the volcanic series being everywhere concealed, there are no\r\nmeans left to verify this inference from an examination of the ejected\r\nmaterial. It may be remarked, however, that the pale yellow sandstones\r\nwhich lie on the east side of the fault and are exposed in the Lyne\r\nWater above West Linton are in great measure composed of fine felsitic\r\nmaterial.[365] They certainly belong to a higher horizon than the most\r\nsoutherly lavas of the Pentland Hills, and if they have not derived\r\ntheir volcanic detritus from the Biggar volcanic area, it may be\r\nassumed that they obtained it from the vent of the Braid Hills. In any\r\ncase they show that after the lavas of the southern end of the Pentland\r\nHills were buried, acid volcanic detritus continued to be abundantly\r\ndistributed over this part of the floor of Lake Caledonia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Explanation to Sheet 24 of the Geological Survey of\r\nScotland, pp. 10, 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _The Biggar Centre_[366]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: This area is included in Sheets 23 and 24 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Scotland. It was mapped and described by myself.\r\n(Explanations of Sheets 23 and 24.) Various parts of it have been\r\nreferred to by earlier writers, particularly Maclaren, _Geology of\r\nFife_, etc., p. 176.]\r\n\r\nAnother distinct group of volcanoes had its centre about 25 miles\r\nsouth-westward from the Braid vent, and on the same line as those of\r\nthe Pentland Hills. In no part of the basin can the isolation of the\r\ndifferent volcanic clusters be so impressively observed as in the\r\narea to the south-west of these hills. On the one hand, the lavas and\r\ntuffs from the Braid vent die out, and on the other, as we follow the\r\nconglomerates south-westwards, a new volcanic series immediately makes\r\nits appearance.\r\n\r\nThe space between the last extremity of the Pentland lavas and the\r\nbeginning of the Biggar series does not exceed some 500 yards. It will\r\nbe remembered that the lower half of the Pentland volcanic series dies\r\nout long before it reaches the southern end of the hills, and that it\r\nis by lavas on the horizon of some of the dark andesites of Allermuir\r\nHill that the volcanic band is finally prolonged to its extreme\r\nsouthern limit. The most northerly extension of the Biggar lavas lies\r\nsomewhere on the same general platform. But whereas, at the north\r\nend of the Pentland chain, the volcanic sheets rest on the edges of\r\nthe Upper Silurian shales, at the south end, several hundred feet of\r\ncoarse conglomerate and sandstone intervene between the Silurian shales\r\nand the porphyrites. So rapidly does the bulk of these sedimentary\r\nformations increase that in the course of two miles they must be 3000\r\nfeet in thickness below the most northerly of the Biggar lavas just\r\nreferred to. But after that point, when they cross the Lyne Water,\r\nthey begin to be more and more interstratified with thin sheets of\r\nandesite. These lavas, the beginning of the Biggar series, soon number\r\nnine or ten distinct bands, and so quickly do they usurp the place of\r\nthe sedimentary materials that in a distance of not more than twelve\r\nmiles they form, where traversed by the river Clyde, the whole breadth\r\nof the visible tract of Old Red Sandstone, to the exclusion of the\r\nconglomerates.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, soon after the lavas make their appearance at the\r\nnorth end they are in great measure overlapped unconformably by the\r\nred sandstones at the base of the Carboniferous system, but where the\r\nMedwin Water has cut through this covering, they can be seen here and\r\nthere underneath on their southerly course.\r\n\r\nA section through the northern end of the Biggar series, where the\r\nsuccessive lavas are dying out northwards among the conglomerates,\r\nshows the structure given in Fig. 91. The sedimentary strata consist\r\nlargely of debris of andesite, and the lavas include dark red or purple\r\nandesites and also pale felsites, both having the same characters as\r\nthose of the Pentland Hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Section across the northern end of the Biggar\r\nvolcanic group, from Fadden Hill to beyond Mendick Hill.\r\n\r\n1. Conglomerates and sandstones; 2. Lavas, the lowest being an\r\nolivine-diabase or basalt, the main mass being andesites; 3. Felsites\r\nand tuffs; 4. Upper Old Red Sandstone. _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nIn one important respect the volcanic series in the northern part of\r\nthe Biggar area differs from that of the Pentland Hills, for whereas\r\nthe uppermost parts of the latter are concealed by faults which bring\r\ndown the Carboniferous strata against the base of the hills, the lavas\r\nat the north end of the Biggar district pass conformably under a thick\r\ngroup of Lower Old Red conglomerates and sandstones. We thus learn\r\nthat here the volcanic eruptions ceased long before the close of the\r\ndeposition of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. The overlying sedimentary\r\nseries is disposed in a long synclinal trough, corresponding in\r\ndirection with the general north-easterly strike of the volcanic rocks\r\nwhich reappear from under the sandstones and conglomerates along its\r\nsouth-eastern border, where they are abruptly truncated by the fault\r\n(_f_, Fig. 92), which brings them against the flanks of the Silurian\r\nUplands. It is interesting to note that by this dislocation the lavas\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone are placed almost in immediate contact\r\nwith those of the Lower Silurian series, which appear here on the\r\ncrests of numerous anticlinal folds that are obliquely cut off by the\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another feature of interest in the northern part of\r\nthe Biggar volcanic centre. While the lowest visible lava is an\r\nolivine-diabase not unlike parts of the Warklaw group of the Pentland\r\nHills, those which occur above it are partly andesites and partly\r\northoclase-felsites. The latter form, among the hills near Dolphinton,\r\nan important group which reaches its greatest development in the Black\r\nMount (1689 feet). These rocks cover a breadth of more than a mile of\r\nground, and probably attain a thickness of not less than 2000 feet.\r\nThey so closely resemble in their general characters the corresponding\r\nrocks of the Pentland Hills that a brief description of them may\r\nsuffice. As in that chain of hills, they are so prone to decomposition\r\nthat they are in large part concealed under a covering of their own\r\ndebris and of herbage, though their fragments form abundant screes, and\r\nnumerous projecting knobs of rock suffice to show the main features of\r\nthe lavas and their accompaniments.\r\n\r\nThe felsites weather into pale yellow and greyish \"claystones,\" but\r\nwhere fresher sections can be procured they often show darker tints of\r\nlilac and purple. They are close-grained, sometimes flinty, generally\r\nporphyritic with scattered highly-kaolinized white felspars, but\r\nwithout quartz, often presenting beautiful flow-structure, and not\r\ninfrequently showing a brecciated appearance, which in the usual\r\nweathered blocks is hardly to be distinguished from the breccia of\r\ninterstratified tuffs.\r\n\r\nA locality where some of these features may be satisfactorily examined\r\nis a dry ravine in the farm of Bank, on the south-east side of the\r\nBlack Mount. Here the felsite possesses such a perfectly developed\r\nflow-structure as to split into slabs which, dipping S.E. at about 25°,\r\nmight deceive the observer into the belief that it is a sedimentary\r\nrock. A fresh fracture shows the laminæ of flow, many of which are\r\nas thin as sheets of paper, to be lilac in colour, some of the more\r\ndecomposed layers assuming tints of grey. The felspars and micas are\r\narranged with their long axes parallel to the lines of flow. The rock\r\nis not vesicular, but it breaks up here and there into the brecciated\r\ncondition just referred to. Below the sheet which displays the most\r\nperfect flow-structure, what is probably a true volcanic breccia makes\r\nits appearance. It consists of angular fragments of a similar lilac\r\nfelsite, of all sizes up to pieces two or three inches in length,\r\ncemented in a matrix of the same material stained reddish-brown. In\r\nthis breccia the stones show little or no flow-structure.\r\n\r\nAbove the group of felsites and felsitic breccias, grey andesites make\r\ntheir appearance, like some of those in the Pentland Hills. They are\r\nsometimes extraordinarily vesicular, the vesicles in the body of the\r\nrock being filled with calcite, agate, etc. Such lavas must have been\r\noriginally sheets of rough slag. The elongated steam-vesicles have been\r\npartly filled up with micaceous sand and fine red mud that were washed\r\ninto crannies of the lava in direct communication with the overlying\r\nwater. It is evident that in the northern part of the Biggar centre the\r\nsuccession of volcanic events followed closely the order observable in\r\nthe Pentland Hills, but on a feebler scale. We may suppose that the\r\nlower diabases and andesites are the equivalents of those of Warklaw\r\nand Allermuir, that the felsites and breccias were contemporaneous\r\nwith those of Capelaw, Caerketton and Castlelaw, and that the last\r\nandesites made their appearance together with those which form the\r\nhighest lavas of the Pentland chain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Section across the southern part of the Biggar\r\nvolcanic group from Covington to Culter.\r\n\r\n1. Lower Silurian strata; 2. Lower Old Red Sandstone (pre-volcanic\r\ngroup); 3. Andesite lavas with intercalated sandstones and\r\nconglomerates; 4. Felsite neck. _f_, The boundary-fault on northern\r\nedge of Southern Uplands.]\r\n\r\nA section across the southern end of the Biggar volcanic belt shows\r\nless diversity of structure (Fig. 92). The lavas (3) are there found\r\nto flatten out and to spread unconformably over the older part of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone (2), which, as already stated, passes down\r\ninto the Upper Silurian shales. A few intercalations of conglomerate,\r\nmainly made up of volcanic detritus, are here and there to be detected\r\namong these lavas. But the chocolate sandstones and conglomerates that\r\nlie unconformably below them contain no such detritus, for they belong\r\nto the pre-volcanic part of the history of Lake Caledonia, and were\r\nhere locally upraised, perhaps as an accompaniment of the terrestrial\r\ndisturbances that preceded or attended the first outburst of volcanic\r\nenergy. Followed south-westwards, the stratigraphical break in the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone disappears, and, as will be shown in the\r\naccount of the Duneaton centre, a continuous succession can there be\r\ntraced from the Upper Silurian shales up into the volcanic series.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in this district is the felsitic boss of\r\nQuothquan already alluded to (p. 288) as rising up through the\r\nandesites, and possibly marking one of the vents of the district. It is\r\none of a number of felsitic intrusions in this neighbourhood, of which\r\nthe most important is Tinto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Section from Thankerton Moor across Tinto to\r\nLamington.\r\n\r\n  1_a_.

The conglomerates and sandstones that\r\nappear on the south slopes of Tinto lie near the base of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and if we could bore among the overlying andesites we should\r\nprobably meet with the Upper Silurian shales among or conformably\r\nbeneath the red passage-beds, as in the Lesmahagow district.\r\n\r\nThe andesitic lavas creep over the upturned denuded edges of these\r\nstrata and sweep round the flanks of Tinto. This conspicuous hill\r\nreaches a height of 2335 feet above the sea, and consists of the\r\nfelsitic rocks already described (p. 278). Seen from many points of\r\nview it rises as a graceful cone, distinguished from all the other\r\neminences around it by the pinkish colour of its screes. In reality it\r\nforms a continuous ridge which runs in an east and west direction for\r\nabout five and a half miles, with a breadth of about a mile. Some part\r\nat least, and possibly the whole of this oblong mass, is in the form\r\nof a sill or laccolite which dips towards the north. Conglomerates and\r\nsandstones plunge under it on the southern side, and similar sandstones\r\noverlie it on the north. If there be a neck in this mass, as one might\r\ninfer from the shape of the hill, its precise limits are concealed. The\r\nrock does not break through the andesites, and may belong to an earlier\r\nperiod of eruptivity than the lavas immediately around it. There were\r\nother, though smaller, vents in the immediate neighbourhood. Besides\r\nthe cone of Quothquan just referred to, another may be marked by the\r\nfelsite boss which overlooks the village of Douglas, four miles to the\r\nsouth-west of the Tinto ridge, while a third rises into a low rounded\r\nhill close to the village of Symington.\r\n\r\nThe lavas spread out again to the south-west of Tinto in a group of\r\nhills, until they are interrupted by a fault which brings in the\r\nDouglas coal-field.[367] This dislocation abruptly terminates the\r\nBiggar volcanic band in a south-westerly direction, after extending for\r\na length of 26 miles, with a breadth of sometimes as much as five miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: See Explanation to Sheet 23 of the Geological Survey of\r\nScotland (1873), p. 15. This ground was mapped and described by Mr. B.\r\nN. Peach.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _The Duneaton Centre_\r\n\r\nAmong the high bleak muirlands on the confines of the three counties of\r\nLanark, Ayr and Dumfries, traversed by the Duneaton Water, a distinct\r\nvolcanic area may be traced.[368] Its boundaries, however, cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily fixed. It is overspread with Carboniferous rocks both\r\nto the north-east and south-west, so that its rocks are only visible\r\nalong a strip about seven miles long and two miles broad. On the\r\nnorth-western side its lower members are seen lying interstratified\r\namong the sandstones and conglomerates which thence pass down\r\nconformably into the Upper Silurian series (Fig. 94). But although we\r\nthus get below the volcanic series we meet with no vents or sills among\r\nthe lower rocks. On the south-east side the highest lavas and tuffs are\r\noverlain by some 5000 feet of red sandstones and conglomerates (2, 3),\r\nwhich completely bury all traces of the volcanic history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: This area was mapped by Mr. B. N. Peach in Sheet 15\r\nof the Geological Survey of Scotland, and is described by him in the\r\naccompanying Memoir.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic series in this limited district reaches an estimated\r\nthickness of 4000 feet, built up of purple and green slaggy\r\nandesites, dark heavy diabases (melaphyres) and tuffs, with abundant\r\ninterstratification of sandstone, especially towards the base. One of\r\nits chief features of interest is the manner in which it exhibits,\r\nbetter, perhaps, than can be found in any of the other volcanic areas,\r\nthe frequent and rapid alternations of lavas and tuffs with sandstone\r\nand conglomerate. In this part of the region the volcanic discharges\r\nwere obviously frequent and intermittent, while at the same time the\r\ntransport and deposition of sediment were continuous. This sediment\r\nconsisted largely, indeed, of volcanic detritus mixed with ordinary\r\nsand and silt. That these conditions of sedimentation were not wholly\r\ninimical to animal life is shown by the occasional occurrence of\r\nworm-burrows in the ashy sandstones.[369]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: Memoir on Sheet 15 Geol. Surv. Scotland (1871), p. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Section across the Duneaton volcanic district\r\nfrom the head of the Duneaton Water to Kirklea Hill.\r\n\r\n1. Silurian strata; 2. Lower Old Red Sandstone and conglomerate; 3.\r\nCoarse conglomerate; 4. Andesite-lavas; 5. Stratified tuffs; 6. Spango\r\ngranite; 7. Upper Old Red Sandstone.]\r\n\r\nThe thick accumulation of sandstones and conglomerates above the main\r\nmass of lavas has been derived almost wholly from the waste of the\r\nvolcanic rocks (3). Blocks of andesite, well rounded and often from\r\nsix to twelve inches in diameter, may be seen in the remarkable band\r\nof coarse conglomerate which runs as a nearly continuous ridge from\r\nthe Nith to the Clyde--a distance of more than twenty miles. Nothing\r\nimpresses the geologist more, as he wanders over this district,\r\nthan the evidence of the prodigious waste which the volcanic series\r\nunderwent before it was finally buried. Some part of the detritus may\r\nhave been supplied, indeed, by occasional discharges of fragmental\r\nmatter, as has already been suggested in the case of the Ochil and\r\nMontrose conglomerates. But the nature of the pebbles in these masses\r\nof ancient shingle shows them to be not bombs, but pieces worn away\r\nfrom sheets of lava.\r\n\r\nThat the lavas underlie these piles of detritus and extend southwards\r\neven up to the very edge of the Silurian Uplands is shown by the\r\nrise of a number of successive beds from under the trough into which\r\nthe conglomerate has been thrown. These lavas, however, are almost\r\nimmediately cut off by the great boundary fault (_f_) which flanks the\r\nSilurian territory. That they are not met with now to the south-east\r\nof the dislocation, where they must once have lain, is an evidence of\r\nthe great denudation which the district has undergone. Fig. 94, which\r\ngives a section across the broadest part of the area, from the edge\r\nof the Muirkirk coal-field to the Silurian uplands, shows the general\r\nstructure of the ground.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory evidence regarding the position of any of the vents of\r\nthe period has been met with in this district. The rocks to the south\r\nof the boundary-fault are older than the Old Red Sandstone, and as\r\nthey must have been for some distance overspread by the conglomerates,\r\nsandstones and volcanic series, we might hope to find somewhere among\r\nthem traces of necks or bosses. The only mass of eruptive rock in that\r\npart of the district is the tract of Spango granite which has been\r\nalready referred to in connection with the subject of the vents and\r\ngranite protrusions of Old Red Sandstone time. This mass, about four\r\nmiles long and two miles broad, rises through Silurian strata, and\r\nby means of the boundary fault is brought against the higher group\r\nof conglomerates and sandstones. The Silurian shales and sandstones\r\naround the granite have undergone contact-metamorphism, becoming highly\r\nmicaceous and schistose. The ascent of this granite must have taken\r\nplace between the upheaval and contortion of the Upper Silurian strata,\r\nand the deposition of the higher parts of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nof this region. Its date might thus come within the limits of the\r\nvolcanic period. But one must frankly own that there is no positive\r\nevidence to connect its production with the volcanic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _The Ayrshire Group of Vents_\r\n\r\nThe original limits of the volcanic districts in the remaining portion\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone area on the mainland of Scotland, from\r\nthe valley of the Nith to the Firth of Clyde, can only be vaguely\r\nindicated.[370] There is a difficulty in ascertaining the south-western\r\ntermination of the Duneaton area, and in deciding whether the lavas and\r\ntuffs of Corsincone in Nithsdale should be assigned to that district or\r\nbe placed with those further to the south-west. Between Corsincone and\r\nthe next visible volcanic rocks of the Lower Old Red Sandstone there\r\nintervenes a space of six miles, along which, owing to the effect of\r\nthe great fault that flanks the north-western margin of the Southern\r\nUplands, the Carboniferous Limestone and even the Coal-measures are\r\nbrought against the Silurian formations, every intermediate series of\r\nrocks being there cut out. It may therefore be, on the whole, better to\r\ninclude all the volcanic rocks on the left side of the Nith as part of\r\nthe Duneaton series. There will still remain a tract of five miles of\r\nblank intermediate ground before we enter upon the volcanic rocks of\r\nAyrshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: The mapping of the Old Red Sandstone volcanic areas of\r\nAyrshire for the Geological Survey was thus distributed:--The district\r\neast of Dalmellington was surveyed by Mr. B. N. Peach, that between\r\nDalmellington and Straiton by Prof. James Geikie, and all from the line\r\nof the Girvan Valley south of Straiton westward to the sea by myself.\r\nThe ground is embraced in Sheets 8, 13 and 14 of the Map of Scotland,\r\nand is described in accompanying Explanations.]\r\n\r\nOwing to complicated faults, extensive unconformable overlaps of\r\nthe Carboniferous formations, and enormous denudation, the volcanic\r\ntracts of Old Red Sandstone age in Ayrshire have been reduced to mere\r\nscattered patches, the true relations of which are not always easily\r\ndiscoverable. One of these isolated areas flanks the Silurian Uplands\r\nas a belt from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth and about six\r\nmiles long, but with its limits everywhere defined by faults. A second\r\nmuch more diversified district extends for about ten miles to the\r\nsouth-west of Dalmellington. It too forms a belt, averaging about four\r\nmiles in breadth, but presenting a singularly complicated geological\r\nstructure. Owing to faults, curvatures and denudation, the volcanic\r\nrocks have there been isolated into a number of detached portions,\r\nbetween some of which the older parts of the Old Red Sandstone, and\r\neven the Silurian rocks, have been laid bare, while between others the\r\nground is overspread with Carboniferous strata. A third unbroken area\r\nforms the Brown Carrick Hills, south of the town of Ayr, and is of\r\nspecial interest from the fact that its rocks have been exposed along\r\na range of sea-cliffs and of beach-sections for a distance of nearly\r\nfour miles. Other detached tracts of volcanic rocks are displayed on\r\nthe shore at Turnberry and Port Garrick, on the hills between Mochrum\r\nand the vale of the Girvan, and on the low ground between Dalrymple and\r\nKirkmichael.\r\n\r\nThe isolation of these various outliers and separated districts is\r\nprobably not entirely due to the effects of subsequent geological\r\nrevolutions. More probably some of the areas were always independent\r\nof each other, and their igneous rocks were discharged from distinct\r\nvolcanic centres. We may conjecture that one of these centres lay\r\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood of New Cumnock, for the lavas between\r\nthat town and Dalmellington appear to diminish in thickness and number\r\nas they are traced south-westward. Another vent, or more probably a\r\ngroup of vents, may have stood on the site of the present hills to the\r\nright and left of the Girvan Valley, south of the village of Straiton.\r\nA third probably rose somewhere between Dailly and Crosshill, and\r\npoured out the lavas of the ridges between Maybole and the Dailly\r\ncoal-field. The important centre of eruption that produced the thick\r\nand extensive lavas of the Brown Carrick Hills may be concealed under\r\nthese hills, or may have stood somewhere to the west of Maybole. Still\r\nanother vent, perhaps now under the sea, appears to be indicated by the\r\nporphyrites of the coast-section between Turnberry and Culzean Bay.\r\n\r\nOwing to the complicated structure of the ground, several important\r\npoints in the history of the Old Red Sandstone of this region have not\r\nbeen established beyond dispute. In particular, the unconformability\r\nwhich undoubtedly exists in that system in the south-west of Ayrshire\r\nhas not been traced far enough eastwards to determine whether it\r\naffects the volcanic belt east of Dalmellington, or whether the\r\nbreak took place before or after the eruption of that belt. West of\r\nDalmellington it clearly separates a higher group of sandstones,\r\nconglomerates and volcanic rocks from everything older than themselves.\r\nThe structure is similar to that in the Pentland Hills, a marked\r\ndisturbance having taken place here as well as there after a\r\nconsiderable portion of the Lower Old Red Sandstone had been deposited.\r\nThese earlier strata were upraised, and on their denuded ends another\r\ngroup of sandstones and conglomerates was laid down, followed by an\r\nextensive eruption of volcanic materials.\r\n\r\nIt is the upper unconformable series that requires to be considered\r\nhere, as it includes all the volcanic rocks of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nlying to the west of the meridian of Dalmellington. The position of\r\nthese rocks on their underlying conglomerates is admirably exposed\r\namong the hills between the valleys of the Doon and the Girvan, as well\r\nas on Bennan Hill to the south of Straiton. The andesites rise in a\r\ncraggy escarpment crowning long green slopes that more or less conceal\r\nthe conglomerates and sandstones below.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast-sections the structure of the volcanic rocks may be\r\nmost advantageously studied. The shore from the Heads of Ayr to Culzean\r\nCastle affords a fine series of exposures, where every feature in\r\nthe succession of the lavas may be observed. Still more instructive,\r\nperhaps, is the mile and a half of beach between Turnberry Bay and\r\nDouglaston, of which I shall here give a condensed account, for\r\ncomparison with the coast-sections of Kincardineshire and Forfarshire\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nThe special feature of this part of the Ayrshire coast-line is the\r\nnumber of distinct andesite sheets which can be discriminated by means\r\nof the thin layers of sandstone and sandy tuff that intervene between\r\nthem. In the short space of a mile and a half somewhere about thirty\r\nsheets can be recognized, each marking a separate outflow of lava.\r\nIt was in this section that I first observed the sandstone-veinings\r\nwhich have been described in previous pages, and nowhere are they more\r\nclearly developed. Almost every successive stream of andesite has been\r\nmore or less fissured in cooling, and its rents and irregular cavernous\r\nhollows have been filled with fine sand silted in from above. The\r\nconnection may often be observed between these sandstone partitions or\r\npatches and the bed of the same material, which overspread the surface\r\nof the lava at the time that the fissures were being filled up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Cavernous spaces in andesite, filled in with\r\nsandstone, John o' Groat's Port, Turnberry, Ayrshire.]\r\n\r\nThe andesites of the Turnberry shore are of the usual dark purplish-red\r\nto green colours, more or less compact in the centre and vesicular\r\ntowards the top and bottom. They display with great clearness the large\r\nempty spaces that were apt to be formed in such viscous slaggy lavas as\r\nthey moved along the lake-bottom. These spaces, afterwards filled with\r\nfine sand, now appear as irregular enclosures of hard green sandstone\r\nembedded in the andesite. The example shown in Fig. 95 may be seen in\r\none of the lavas at John o' Groat's Port.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--Section of andesites, Turnberry Castle,\r\nAyrshire.]\r\n\r\nFrom the arrangement of the veins of sandstone it is evident that\r\nirregularly divergent, but often more or less stellate, fissures opened\r\nin the lavas as they cooled. Sometimes, indeed, the molten rock appears\r\nto have broken up into a shattered mass of fragments, as must often\r\nhave happened when lavas were poured over the lake-floor. What may be\r\nan instance of this effect is to be seen on the cliff under the walls\r\nof Turnberry Castle, whence the annexed sketch (Fig. 96) was taken. The\r\nlower andesite (_a_) is highly amygdaloidal towards the top, and is\r\ntraversed in all directions with irregular veins and nests of sandstone\r\nwhich can be traced upward to the bed (_b_), consisting of sandstone,\r\nbut so full of lumps or slags of amygdaloidal andesite that one is here\r\nand there puzzled whether to regard it as a sedimentary deposit, or as\r\nthe upper layer of clinkers of a lava-stream strewn with sand. Above\r\nthis fragmentary layer lies another bed of andesite (_c_) of a coarsely\r\namygdaloidal structure, which encloses patches of the underlying\r\nsandstone. It passes upward, in a space of from four to six feet, into\r\na mass of angular scoriaceous fragments (_d_) of all sizes up to blocks\r\n18 inches in length cemented in a vein-stuff of calcite, chalcedony and\r\nquartz. This brecciated structure ascends for about 13 or 14 feet, and\r\nis then succeeded by a greenish compact andesite (_e_), which further\r\nnorth becomes amygdaloidal and much veined with sandstone, passing into\r\na breccia of lava fragments and sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Lenticular form of a brecciated andesite\r\n(shown in Fig. 96), Turnberry, Ayrshire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map III.]\r\n\r\n  MAP OF THE VOLCANIC DISTRICTS OF THE LOWER OLD RED SANDSTONE\r\n  OF \"LAKE CALEDONIA\" IN CENTRAL SCOTLAND & NORTH EAST IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe remarkable brecciated band (_d_) in this cliff, though 13 or 14 feet\r\nin the centre, immediately thins out on either side, until in the\r\ncourse of a few yards it completely disappears and allows the lavas\r\n_c_ and _e_ to come together, as shown in Fig. 97. We may suppose that\r\nthis section reveals the structure of the terminal portion of a highly\r\nviscous lava which was shattered into fragments as it moved along under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNo clear evidence of the sites of any of the volcanic vents has yet\r\nbeen detected in the Old Red Sandstone of Ayrshire. Possibly some\r\nof the numerous felsitic bosses to the south-west of Dalmellington\r\nmay partly mark their positions. But the sills connected with the\r\nvolcanic series are well exposed in the 12 miles of hilly ground\r\nbetween Dalmellington and Barr. Two groups of intrusive sheets may\r\nthere be seen. The most numerous consist of pale or dark-pink felsite,\r\noften full of crystals of mica. They form prominent hills, such as\r\nTurgeny, Knockskae and Garleffin Fell. The second group comprises\r\nvarious diabase-sheets which have been intruded near the base of the\r\nred sandstones and conglomerates, over a distance of seven miles on\r\nthe north side of the Stinchar Valley above Barr. They attain their\r\ngreatest development on Jedburgh Hill, where they form a series of\r\nsuccessive sills, the largest of which unite northwards into one thick\r\nmass and die out southward among the sandstones and conglomerates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE LOWER OLD RED SANDSTONE OF THE CHEVIOT HILLS, LORNE,\r\n\"LAKE ORCADIE\" AND KILLARNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEVIOT AND BERWICKSHIRE DISTRICT\r\n\r\nIn the south-east of Scotland, and extending thence into the north of\r\nEngland, the remains of several distinct volcanic centres of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone may still be recognized. Of these the largest and\r\nmost interesting forms the mass of the Cheviot Hills; a second has\r\nbeen partially dissected by the sea along the coast south from St.\r\nAbb's Head; while possibly relics of others may survive in detached\r\nbosses of eruptive rock which rise through the Silurian formations\r\nof Berwickshire. The water-basin in which these volcanic groups were\r\nactive was named by me \"Lake Cheviot,\"[371] to distinguish it from the\r\nother basins of the same geological period (Map I.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: _Trans. Roy. Soc._ Edin. xxviii. (1878), p. 354.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rocks of the Cheviot Hills, though their limits have\r\nbeen reduced by faults, unconformable overlap of younger formations\r\nand severe denudation, still cover about 230 square miles of ground,\r\nand rise to a height of 2676 feet above the sea. As they have been\r\nmapped in detail by the Geological Survey, both on the English and the\r\nScottish sides of the Border, their structure is now known.[372] No\r\ngood horizontal section, however, has yet been constructed to show this\r\nstructure--a deficiency which, it is hoped, may before long be supplied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: The Geology of the Cheviot Hills is comprised in Sheets\r\n108 N.E., 109 N.W., and 110 S.W. of the Geological Survey of England\r\nand Wales, and in Sheets 17, 18 and 26 of the Geological Survey of\r\nScotland. For descriptive accounts the Memoirs to some of these Sheets\r\nmay be consulted, particularly \"Geology of the Cheviot Hills\" (English\r\nside), by C. T. Clough (_Mem. Geol. Surv._ 1888); \"Geology of Otterburn\r\nand Elsdon,\" by H. Miller and C. T. Clough (_Mem. Geol. Surv._ 1887);\r\n\"Geology of Part of Northumberland between Wooler and Coldstream,\" by\r\nW.

(1876), reprinted in\r\n_Fragments of Earth-lore_ (1893), and by Prof. Lebour, _Outlines of\r\nthe Geology of Northumberland_, 2nd edit. 1886. For the petrography\r\nof the rocks consult Mr. J. J. H. Teall, _Geol. Mag._ 1883, pp. 100,\r\n145, 252, 344; 1884, p. 226; 1885, p. 106; _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ ix.\r\n(1886) p. 575; and his _British Petrography_, 1888; Dr. J. Petersen,\r\n_Mikroskopische und chemische Untersuchungen am Enstatit-porphyrit aus\r\nden Cheviot Hills_, Inaugural Dissertation, Kiel, 1884.]\r\n\r\nThis volcanic pile, consisting mainly of bedded andesites which rest\r\nunconformably on the upturned edges of Wenlock shales and grits,\r\npresents a most typical display of the lavas of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. These rocks range from vitreous or resinous pitchstone-like\r\nvarieties to coarsely porphyritic forms, on the one hand, and to highly\r\nvesicular and amygdaloidal kinds, on the other. Analyses of some of\r\nthese rocks, and an account of their petrography, have already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe lavas are often separated by thin partings of tuff, and their\r\nupper surfaces show the fissured character with sandstone infillings,\r\nso characteristic among the lavas of \"Lake Caledonia.\"[373] Tuffs\r\nform a very subordinate part of the whole volcanic series. One of the\r\nmost important bands is a thick mass at the base of the series, lying\r\nimmediately on the highly inclined Silurian shales. The fragments are\r\ngenerally of a fine-grained purple mica-andesite, often two or three\r\nfeet and sometimes at least five feet long. For a few feet near the\r\nbottom of this mass of tuff, pieces of Silurian shale an inch in length\r\nmay be noticed. Mr. Clough remarks that distinct bedding is not usual\r\namong the tuffs. Though no doubt most of the fragmental materials\r\nreally lie intercalated between successive lava-streams, yet some of\r\nthe isolated patches of coarse volcanic breccia may mark the sites of\r\neruptive vents. One such probable neck has been mapped on the Scottish\r\nside between Cocklawfoot, at the head of the Bowmont Water, and King's\r\nSeat, while others may perhaps occur among the detached patches that\r\nhave been observed on the Northumbrian side. No thick conglomerates\r\nor sandstones have been noticed in the Cheviot District. The volcanic\r\neruptions appear to have usually succeeded each other without the\r\nspread of any notable amount of ordinary detritus over the floor of\r\nthe water-basin. It is difficult to estimate the total thickness of\r\nvolcanic material here piled up, but it probably amounts to several\r\nthousand feet. The top of the series is not visible, having been\r\npartly removed by denudation and partly buried under the Carboniferous\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: Clough, _Geology of the Cheviot Hills_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the Cheviot area stands apart from the\r\nother volcanic districts of the Lower Old Red Sandstone in the great\r\nrelative thickness of its accumulated lavas, the comparative thinness\r\nof its tuffs, and the absence of the thick intercalations of coarse\r\nconglomerate so abundantly developed among the volcanic series all over\r\nCentral Scotland. But there is yet another characteristic in which this\r\narea is pre-eminently conspicuous. In the heart of the andesites lies a\r\ncore of augite-granitite, around which these rocks are traversed with\r\ndykes.\r\n\r\nThis interesting granitic boss rises into the highest summit of the\r\nwhole Cheviot range, and covers an area of rather more than 20 square\r\nmiles. While its petrographical characters have been described by Mr.\r\nTeall, its boundary has been mapped by Mr. Clough, who found the line\r\ndifficult to trace, owing partly to the prevalent covering of peat, and\r\npartly to the jagged and irregular junction caused by the protrusion of\r\ndykes from and into the boss. He obtained evidence that the granite has\r\nbroken through the bedded andesites, and that it is in turn traversed\r\nby dykes composed of a material indistinguishable from that of some\r\nof the flows. He therefore considered that it is essentially of the\r\nsame age as the rest of the volcanic series, and \"not improbably the\r\ndeep-seated source of it.\"[374] Mr. Teall also, from a chemical and\r\nmicroscopical examination of the rocks, drew a similar conclusion.[375]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _Op. cit._ p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _Geol. Mag._ 1885, p. 106.]\r\n\r\nThe andesites around the granite have undergone contact-metamorphism,\r\nbut the nature and extent of the change have not yet been\r\nstudied. There occur around the granite many dykes of felsite and\r\nquartz-felsite, to the petrographical character of which reference has\r\nalready been made. But the most abundant and remarkable dykes of the\r\ndistrict are those of a reddish mica-porphyrite, of which Mr. Clough\r\nhas mapped no fewer than forty, besides those in the granitic area. He\r\nhas called attention to the significant manner in which all the dykes\r\nof the district tend to point in a general way to the great core of\r\ngranite, as if that were the nucleus from which they had radiated.[376]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _Op. cit._ pp. 26-28.]\r\n\r\nThe central granite of the Cheviot Hills, with its peripheral dykes,\r\nhas no accompanying agglomerates nor any decided proof that it\r\never communicated with the surface. When, however, we consider its\r\npetrographical and chemical constitution, its position as a core\r\namong the bedded lavas, and the intimate way in which it is linked\r\nwith these rocks by the network of dykes, we are, I think, justified\r\nin accepting the inference that it belongs to the volcanic series.\r\nIt possesses some curious and interesting features in common with\r\nthe great granophyre bosses of Tertiary age in the Inner Hebrides.\r\nLike these it has no visible accompaniment of superficial discharges.\r\nYet it may have ascended by means of some central vent or group of\r\nvents which, offering to it a weak part of the crust, allowed it to\r\ncommunicate with the surface and give rise to the outflow of lavas and\r\nfragmental ejections. In any case, it affords us a most interesting and\r\ninstructive insight into one of the deeper-seated ducts of a volcanic\r\nregion, and the relation of a volcanic focus to the ascent of the\r\ngranitic magma.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles to the north of the Cheviot Hills, and separated\r\nfrom them by the Carboniferous and Upper Old Red Sandstones which\r\nspread across the broad plain of the Merse, a group of volcanic rocks\r\nhas been laid open in a singularly instructive manner along the coast\r\nof Berwickshire, between the village of Eyemouth and the promontory\r\nof St. Abb's Head. Not only the actual vents, but the lavas and tuffs\r\nconnected with them, have there been admirably dissected by the forces\r\nof denudation.\r\n\r\nThat this volcanic area was quite distinct from that of the Cheviot\r\nHills may be inferred from its coarse agglomerates, and from the fact\r\nthat when the rocks are followed inland in a south-westerly direction,\r\nthat is, towards the Cheviot area, they are found to diminish in\r\nthickness and to disappear among the ordinary sediments. For the same\r\nreason we may regard the area as independent of any vents which may\r\nhave risen further west about Cockburn Law and the Dirrington Laws.\r\nUnfortunately, however, only a small part of the area comes into view,\r\nthe rest of it lying beneath the waters of the North Sea.[377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: This area lies in Sheet 34 Geological Survey of\r\nScotland, and was described by myself in the Memoir to accompany that\r\nSheet (\"Geology of Eastern Berwickshire,\" 1864, p. 20). More recently\r\nthe shore between St. Abb's Head and Coldingham has been re-mapped by\r\nProfessor James Geikie who has also studied the microscopic character\r\nof the rocks, _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xiv. (1887).]\r\n\r\nOf the several vents dissected along this coast-line, one may be seen\r\nat Eyemouth, filled with a very coarse tumultuous agglomerate of\r\nandesite fragments embedded in a compact felspathic matrix, through\r\nwhich are scattered broken crystals of felspar, and imperfect tabular\r\ncrystals of black mica. Another of similar character is exposed for\r\nmore than a mile and a half along the shore at Coldingham. It contains\r\nblocks, sometimes more than a yard in diameter, of different varieties\r\nof andesite, and, as at Eyemouth, is much invaded by veins and bosses\r\nof intrusive andesite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Section across the volcanic area of St. Abb's\r\nHead (after Prof. J. Geikie).\r\n\r\n  11. Silurian formations; 2. Lower Old Red Conglomerate and\r\n     Sandstone; 3 3. Sheets of andesitic lava; 4. Volcanic tuffs,\r\n     largely composed of scoriæ in the higher parts; 5. Volcanic\r\n     agglomerate of neck on shore; 6. Intrusive andesites. _f_, Fault.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo the north of Coldingham, a series of bedded volcanic rocks which\r\nform the picturesque headland of St. Abb's Head, are, according to the\r\nestimate of Professor James Geikie, about 1000 to 1200 feet thick,\r\nbut neither their bottom nor their top is seen. The same observer\r\nfound them to consist of three groups of andesite sheets separated and\r\noverlain by bedded tuffs. The lowest lavas have their base concealed\r\nunder the sea, and are covered by a thick band of coarse agglomeratic\r\ntuff, above which lies the second group of andesites, about 250 feet\r\nthick. An intercalation of various tuffs from 40 to 50 feet thick then\r\nsucceeds, followed by the third lava-group, 250 or 300 feet in depth.\r\nThe highest member of the series is a mass of bedded tuffs some 400\r\nfeet thick.\r\n\r\nThe andesites lie in beds varying from about 15 to about 50 feet\r\nor more in thickness. They are fine-grained, purplish-blue, or\r\ngreyish-blue, often reddish rocks, of the usual type. Generally rather\r\nclose-grained, they are not as a rule very porphyritic, but often\r\nhighly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal, especially towards the top and\r\nbottom of each bed. The more slaggy portions are sometimes so filled in\r\nwith fine tuff that the rock might be mistaken for one of fragmental\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe bedded tuffs are usually well stratified deposits. The most\r\nimportant band of them is that which forms the highest member of the\r\nvolcanic series. It consists of successive beds that vary from fine\r\nred mudstones up to volcanic breccias with blocks one foot or more\r\nin diameter. The materials have been derived from the explosion of\r\nandesitic lavas. Most of the lapilli are vesicular or amygdaloidal,\r\nand many of them have evidently come from vitreous scoriaceous\r\nlavas. Professor Geikie remarks that \"from their highly vesicular\r\ncharacter, they might well have floated in water at the time of their\r\nejection--they are in short mere cinders.\" He could detect no trace of\r\nordinary sediment in the matrix, the whole material being thoroughly\r\nvolcanic in origin.\r\n\r\nThe lavas, tuffs and agglomerates have been abundantly invaded by\r\nintrusive rocks, chiefly andesites.[378]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: See Prof. J. Geikie, _op. cit._]\r\n\r\nThe agglomerates of this Berwickshire coast extend for a short way\r\ninland from the Coldingham and Eyemouth vents, but the fragmental\r\nmaterial soon becomes finer and more water-rolled, and assumes a\r\ndistinctly stratified structure, as it is gradually and increasingly\r\ninterleaved with layers of ordinary sediment. Hence in passing towards\r\nthe south-west, away from the coast-line, we are obviously receding\r\nfrom the vents of eruption and entering into the usual non-volcanic\r\ndeposits of the time. That these deposits belong to the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone was first ascertained during the progress of the Geological\r\nSurvey in this district by the discovery of abundant plant-remains in\r\nthe form of linear grass-like strips, and also pieces of _Pterygotus_\r\nin some of the green shales interstratified among fine tuffs and ashy\r\nsandstones.[379] Before the volcanic detritus disappears from the\r\nstrata as they are followed in a south-westerly direction, the whole\r\nseries is unconformably overlain by the Upper Old Red Sandstone. The\r\nlower division of the formation is not again seen until it rises from\r\nunder the southern margin of the plain of the Merse into the Cheviot\r\nHills.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: \"Geology of Eastern Berwickshire,\" _Mem. Geol. Surv.\r\nScotland_ (1864), pp. 26, 27, 57.]\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles to the south-west of the large Coldingham neck the\r\ngreat boss of Cockburn Law and Stoneshiel Hill rises out of the\r\nSilurian rocks.[380] Five miles still further in the same direction\r\nthe group of the beautiful cones of Dirrington (Fig. 70) overlooks\r\nthe wide Merse of Berwickshire,[381] and six miles to the north of\r\nthese hills, in the very heart of Lammermuir, lies the solitary\r\nboss of the Priestlaw granite.[382] To these protrusions of igneous\r\nmaterial reference has already been made as possible volcanic vents\r\nconnected with the eruptions of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. As regards\r\ntheir age they must certainly be younger than the Llandovery rocks\r\nwhich they disrupt, and older than the Upper Old Red Sandstone, of\r\nwhich the conglomerates, largely made from their debris, lie on them\r\nunconformably. It seems therefore probable that these great bosses may\r\nform a part of the volcanic history of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nperiod. But no positive proof has yet been obtained that any one of\r\nthem was the site of an eruptive vent, and no trace has been detected\r\naround them of any lavas or tuffs which might have proceeded from them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: See \"The Geology of Eastern Berwickshire\" (Sheet 34),\r\n_Mem. Geol. Surv. Scotland_ (1864), p. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: These hills are chiefly represented in Sheet 25. But see\r\n\"The Geology of East Lothian,\" _Mem. Geol. Surv. Scotland_ (1866), p.\r\n26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: \"Geology of East Lothian,\" _Mem. Geol. Surv. Scotland_,\r\np. 15, and authorities there cited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE LAKE OF LORNE\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--View of terraced andesite hills resting on\r\nmassive conglomerate, south of Oban.]\r\n\r\nThe basin of Lorne has not yet been carefully examined and described,\r\nthough various writers have referred to different parts of it (Map I.).\r\nMy own observations have been too few to enable me to give an adequate\r\naccount of it. The volcanic sheets of this area form a notable feature\r\nin the scenery of the West Highlands, for they are the materials out\r\nof which the remarkable terraced hills have been carved, which stretch\r\nfrom Loch Melfort to Loch Creran (Fig. 99), and which reappear in\r\npicturesque outliers among the mountains traversed by Glen Coe. Between\r\nthe ancient schists that form the foundation-rocks of this district and\r\nthe base of the volcanic series, lies a group of sedimentary strata\r\nwhich in the western part of the district must be 500 feet thick.\r\nThis group consists of exceedingly coarse breccias at the bottom,\r\nabove which come massive conglomerates, volcanic grits or tuffs,\r\nfine sandstones and courses of shale. While the basement-breccias\r\nare composed mainly of detritus of the underlying schists, including\r\nblocks six feet long, they pass up into coarse conglomerates made up\r\nalmost entirely of fragments of different lavas (andesites, diabases,\r\netc.), and more than 100 feet thick, which often show little or no\r\ntrace of stratification, but break up into large quadrangular blocks\r\nby means of joints which cut across the imbedded boulders. These\r\nvolcanic conglomerates form some of the more conspicuous features of\r\nthe coast to the south and north of Oban, and are well exposed in the\r\nIsle of Kerrera. They offer many points of resemblance to those of\r\nLake Caledonia, but no certain proof has been noted that they belong\r\nto the Lower Old Red Sandstone. They have obviously been derived from\r\nlava-sheets that were exposed to strong breaker-action, which at\r\nthe same time transported and rounded blocks of granite, schist and\r\nother crystalline rocks derived from the adjacent hills. During the\r\nintervals of quieter sedimentation indicated by the fine sandstones and\r\nshales, volcanic explosions continued, as may be seen by the occurrence\r\nof occasional large bombs which have fallen upon and pressed down the\r\nfine ashy silt that was gathering on the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the characters of some of the strata in this\r\nsedimentary series that over the area of deposit portions of the\r\nshallower waters were occasionally laid bare to the sun and air.\r\nAmong the conglomerates there lie certain bands of reddish sandy,\r\nripple-marked, sun-cracked and rain-pitted shales and fine sandstones.\r\nSuch accumulations, indicative of the ultimate exposure of fine\r\nsediment that silted up hollows in the great banks of coarse shingle,\r\nmay be noticed at the south end of the Island of Kerrera, on at least\r\ntwo horizons which are separated from each other by thick masses of\r\nconglomerate and fine felspathic grit. We may infer, therefore, that\r\nthe fine littoral mud, which gathered during pauses in the heaping\r\nup of the coarse gravel and shingle, was occasionally laid dry.\r\nSimilar strata may be observed behind Oban, where the alternation of\r\nexceedingly fine sediment and granular ashy bands is well exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Section of lava-escarpment at Beinn Lora,\r\nnorth side of mouth of Loch Etive, Argyllshire.\r\n\r\n1. Phyllites; 2. Thick conglomerate; 3. Successive sheets of andesite.]\r\n\r\nBut the explosions that gave rise to the volcanic materials so largely\r\nrepresented in these lower conglomerates, were merely preliminary to\r\nthose which led to the outflow of the great sheets of lava that now\r\nconstitute so large a part of the hills of Lorne. In the few traverses\r\nwhich I have made across different parts of this district I have noted\r\nthe general resemblance of the lavas to those of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone of the Midland Valley of Scotland, their bedded character,\r\nand the occurrence of occasional layers of stratified material between\r\nthem. The prominent features of these rocks, and their relation to the\r\nvolcanic conglomerates below them, and to the underlying slates and\r\nschists are well displayed on Beinn Lora at the mouth of Loch Etive\r\n(Fig. 100). There the black slates of the district are unconformably\r\ncovered by the coarse volcanic conglomerate, formed chiefly of blocks\r\nof andesite, cemented in a hard matrix of similar composition. About\r\n150 or 200 feet of this material underlie the great escarpment of the\r\nlavas, which here rise in successive beds to the top of the hill, 1000\r\nfeet above its base.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Loch Etive the base of the volcanic series, with\r\nits underlying conglomerate, may be followed westward to Oban and\r\nthence southward to Loch Feochan. The lavas cover most of the ground\r\nfrom the western shore eastwards to near Loch Awe. But this area is\r\nstill very imperfectly known. The Geological Survey, however, has now\r\nadvanced to this part of the country, so that we shall before long\r\nbe in possession of more detailed information regarding the character\r\nand sequence of its volcanic history and the geological age of the\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Kynaston, who has begun the mapping of the eastern portion of\r\nthe district, finds that there, as further west, the bottom of the\r\nvolcanic series is generally a breccia or conglomerate. He has met with\r\ntwo leading types among the lavas, the more abundant being strongly\r\nvesicular, the other more compact. He has observed also numerous dykes\r\nand sills of intrusive porphyrite, trending in a general N.N.E. and\r\nS.S.W. direction, and pointing towards the great granite mass of Ben\r\nCruachan.[383]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: _Ann. Report Geol. Surv._ (1895), p. 29 of reprint.]\r\n\r\nMr. R. G. Symes has traced the volcanic series to the north and south\r\nof Oban. While visiting with him part of his ground, I was much struck\r\nwith the evidence of an intrusive mass at the base of the volcanic\r\nseries in the Sound of Kerrera. A prominent feature on the east side\r\nof the channel, known as Dun Uabairtich and 270 feet high, consists of\r\nandesite which appears to combine both a central boss and a sill. The\r\nrock breaks through the black slates and the overlying conglomerates\r\nand sandstones, and has wedged itself into the unconformable junction\r\nbetween the two formations. It is beautifully columnar on its\r\nsea-covered face, some of the columns being 120 feet or more in length,\r\nand gently curved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LAKE ORCADIE\"\r\n\r\nWe now cross the whole breadth of the Scottish Highlands in order to\r\nperuse the records of another of the great detached water-basins of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, which for the sake of brevity of reference I\r\nhave named and described as \"Lake Orcadie\" (Map I.). This area has\r\nits southern limits along the base of the hills that enclose the wide\r\nMoray Firth. It spreads northward over the Orkney and much of the\r\nShetland Islands, but its boundaries in that direction are lost under\r\nthe sea. In the extensive sheet of water which spread over all that\r\nnorthern region the peculiar Caithness Flags, with their associated\r\nsandstones and conglomerates, were deposited to a total depth of 16,000\r\nfeet. A sigillaroid and lycopodiaceous vegetation flourished on the\r\nsurrounding land, together with ferns, _Psilophyton_ and conifers. The\r\nwaters teemed with fishes of which many genera and species have now\r\nbeen described. The remains of these creatures lie crowded upon each\r\nother in the flagstones in such a manner as to indicate that from time\r\nto time vast quantities of fish were suddenly killed. Not impossibly,\r\nthese destructions may have been connected with the volcanic activity\r\nwhich has now to be described.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1878 I called attention to the evidence for the existence\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic rocks in the Old Red Sandstone north of the\r\nrange of the Grampians, and specially noted three localities where this\r\nevidence could be seen--Strathbogie, Buckie and Shetland.[384] Since\r\nthat time Messrs. B. N. Peach and J. Horne have added a fourth centre\r\nin the Orkney Islands. At present, therefore, we are acquainted with\r\nthe records of four separate groups of volcanic vents in Lake Orcadie.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxviii. (1878).]\r\n\r\nThe southern margin of this water-basin appears to have indented the\r\nland with long fjord-like inlets. One of these now forms the vale of\r\nStrathbogie, which runs into the hills for a distance of fully 20 miles\r\nbeyond what seems to have been the general trend of the coast-line. In\r\nthis valley I found a bed of dark vesicular diabase intercalated among\r\nthe red sandstones and high above the base of the formation, as exposed\r\non the west side of the valley near Burn of Craig. On the east side a\r\nsimilar band has since been mapped for the Geological Survey by Mr. L.\r\nHinxman who has traced it for some miles down the Strath.[385] This\r\nlatter band, as shown in Fig. 101, lies not far above the bottom of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone of this district, and is thus probably distinct\r\nfrom the Craig outcrop. There would thus appear to be evidence of two\r\nseparate outflows of basic lava in this fjord of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: See Sheet 76 of the Geological Survey of Scotland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Section across Strathbogie, below Rhynie,\r\nshowing the position of the volcanic band.\r\n\r\n1. Knotted schists; 2. Diorite intrusive in schists; 3. Old Red\r\nConglomerate; 4. Volcanic band; 5. Shales with calcareous nodules; 6.\r\nSandstones of Rhynie; 7. Shales and sandstones. _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nNo vestige has here been found of any vent, nor is the lava accompanied\r\nwith tuff. The eruptions took place some time after the earlier\r\nsediments of the basin were accumulated, but ceased before the thick\r\nmass of upper sandstones and shales was deposited. A section across\r\nthe valley gives the structure represented in the accompanying diagram\r\n(Fig. 101).\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles further north a still smaller andesite band has been\r\ndetected by Mr. J. Grant Wilson among the sandstones and conglomerates\r\nnear Buckie.[386] It is a truly contemporaneous flow, for pebbles of it\r\noccur in the overlying strata. But again it forms only a solitary bed,\r\nand no trace of any accompanying tuff has been met with, nor of the\r\nvent from which it came. Both this vent and that of Strathbogie must\r\nhave been situated near the southern coast-line of the lake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: See Sheet 95 of the Geological Survey of Scotland and\r\n_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. (1878), p. 435.]\r\n\r\nAt a distance of some 90 miles northward from these Moray Firth\r\nvents another volcanic district lies in the very heart of the Orkney\r\nIslands.[387] The lavas which were there ejected occur at the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of the island of Shapinshay, where they are\r\nregularly bedded with the flagstones. They consist of dark green\r\nolivine-diabases with highly amygdaloidal and vesicular upper\r\nsurfaces. Their thickness cannot be ascertained, as their base is not\r\nseen, but they have been cut by the sea into trenches which show them\r\nto exceed 30 feet in depth. The position of the vent from which they\r\ncame has not been ascertained. Neither here nor in the Moray Firth area\r\ndo any sills accompany the interbedded sheets, and in both cases the\r\nvolcanic action would seem to have been of a feeble and short-lived\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: Messrs. B. N. Peach and J. Horne, _Proc. Roy. Phys. Soc.\r\nEdin._ vol. v. (1879), p. 80.]\r\n\r\nMuch more important were the volcanoes that broke out nearly 100\r\nmiles still further north, where the Mainland of Shetland now lies.\r\nI shall never forget the pleasure with which I first recognized the\r\ntraces of these eruptions, and found near the most northerly limits\r\nof the British Isles proofs of volcanic activity in the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. Since my observations were published,[388] Mr. Peach, who\r\naccompanied me in Shetland, has returned to the district, and, in\r\nconcert with his colleague Mr. Horne, has extended our knowledge of\r\nthe subject.[389] The chief vent or vents lay towards the west and\r\nnorth-west of the Mainland and North Mavine; others of a less active\r\nand persistent type were blown out some 25 miles to the east, where\r\nthe islands of Bressay and Noss now stand. In the western district\r\nstreams of slaggy andesite and diabase with showers of fine tuff and\r\ncoarse agglomerate were ejected, until the total accumulation reached\r\na thickness of not less than 500 feet. The volcanic eruptions took\r\nplace contemporaneously with the deposition of the red sandstones, for\r\nthe lavas and tuffs are intercalated in these strata. The lavas and\r\nvolcanic conglomerates are traceable from the southern coast of Papa\r\nStour across St. Magnus' Bay to the western headlands of Esha Ness,\r\na distance of more than 14 miles. They have been cut by the Atlantic\r\ninto a picturesque range of cliffs, which exhibit in some places, as\r\nat the singular sea-stalk of Doreholm, rough banks of andesitic lava\r\nwith the conglomerate deposited against and over them, and in other\r\nplaces, as along the cliffs of Esha Ness, sheets of lava overlying the\r\nconglomerates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. (1878), p. 418.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: _Ibid._ vol. xxxii. (1884), p. 359.]\r\n\r\nNo trace of any vents has been found in the western and chief volcanic\r\ndistrict, but in Noss Sound a group of small necks occurs, filled with\r\na coarse agglomerate composed of pieces of sandstone, flagstone and\r\nshale. Messrs. Peach and Horne infer that these little orifices never\r\ndischarged any streams of lava. More probably they were opened by\r\nexplosions which only gave forth vapours and fragmentary discharges,\r\nsuch as a band of tuff which is intercalated among the flagstones in\r\ntheir neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most striking features of the volcanic phenomena of\r\nthis remote region is the relative size and number of the sills and\r\ndykes which here as elsewhere mark the latest phases of subterranean\r\nactivity. Messrs. Peach and Horne have shown us that three great sheets\r\nof acid rocks (granites and spherulitic felsites, to which reference\r\nhas already been made, p. 292) have been injected among the sandstones\r\nand basic lavas, that abundant veins of granite, quartz-felsite and\r\nrhyolite radiate from these acid sills, and that the latest phase of\r\nigneous action in this region was the intrusion of a series of bosses\r\nand dykes of basic rocks (diabases) which traverse the sills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Killarney District\r\n\r\nIn the south of Ireland the Upper Silurian strata are followed upwards\r\nconformably by the great series of red sandstones and conglomerates\r\nknown as the \"Dingle Beds.\" Lithologically these rocks present the\r\nclosest resemblance to the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Central Scotland.\r\nThey occupy a similar stratigraphical position, and though they have\r\nnot yielded any palæontological data for comparison, there can, I\r\nthink, be no hesitation in classing them with the Scottish Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone, and regarding them as having been deposited under\r\nsimilar geographical conditions. They offer one feature of special\r\ninterest for the purpose of the present inquiry, since they contain a\r\nwell-marked group of contemporaneous volcanic rocks, including nodular\r\nfelsites, like those so characteristic of the Silurian period.\r\n\r\nThe area where this remote and isolated volcanic group is best\r\ndeveloped forms a range of high rugged ground along the northern front\r\nof the hills that stretch eastward from the Lakes of Killarney. Their\r\ngeneral distribution is shown on Sheets 184 and 185 of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Ireland;[390] though I may again remark that petrography has\r\nmade great strides during the thirty years and more that have passed\r\nsince these maps and their accompanying Memoirs were published, and\r\nthat, were the district to be surveyed now, probably a considerable\r\ntract of ground coloured as ash would be marked as felsite. At the same\r\ntime the existence of both these rocks here cannot be gainsaid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: See the Memoir (by J. B. Jukes and G. V. Du Noyer) on\r\nSheet 184, p. 15. Other volcanic rocks have been mapped at Valentia\r\nHarbour in the Dingle Beds, but these I have not had an opportunity of\r\npersonally examining.]\r\n\r\nThe felsite was long ago brought into notice by Dr. Haughton,\r\nwho published an analysis of it.[391] It is also referred to by\r\nMr. Teall for its spherulitic structure.[392] Seen on the ground\r\nit appears as a pale greenish-grey close-grained rock, sometimes\r\nexhibiting flow-structure in a remarkably clear manner, the laminæ of\r\ndevitrification following each other in wavy lines, sometimes twisted\r\nand delicately puckered or frilled, as in some schists. Portions of the\r\nrock are strongly nodular, the nodules varying in size from less than a\r\npea to that of a hen's egg.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ vol. xxiii. (1859), p. 615.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _British Petrography_, p. 349.]\r\n\r\nThe close resemblance of this rock to many of the Lower Silurian\r\nnodular felsites of Wales cannot but strike the geologist. It presents\r\nanalogies also to the Upper Silurian felsites of Dingle. But its\r\nchief interest arises from the geological horizon on which it occurs.\r\nLying in the so-called \"Dingle-Beds,\" which may be regarded as the\r\nequivalents of the Lower Old Red Sandstone of England and Scotland, it\r\nis, so far as my observations go, the only example of such a nodular\r\nfelsite of later date than the Silurian period. We recognize in it a\r\nsurvival, as it were, of the peculiar Silurian type of acid lava, the\r\nlast preceding eruption of which took place not many miles to the\r\nwest, in the Dingle promontory. But elsewhere this type does not appear\r\nto have survived the end of the Silurian period.\r\n\r\nThe detrital rocks accompanying the felsite, in the district east of\r\nKillarney, vary from such closed-grained felsitic material as cannot\r\nreadily be distinguished from the felsite itself to unmistakable\r\nfelsitic breccias. Even in the finest parts of them, occasional rounded\r\nquartz-pebbles may be detected, while here and there a reddish shaly\r\nband, or a layer of fine pebbly conglomerate with quartz-pebbles an\r\ninch in length, shows at once the bedding and the dip. Mr. W. W. Watts,\r\nwho, with Mr. A. M'Henry of the Irish Staff of the Geological Survey,\r\naccompanied me over this ground, found that a microscopic examination\r\nof the slides which were prepared from the specimens we collected\r\ncompletely confirmed the conclusions reached from inspection of the\r\nrocks in the field.[393] He detected among the angular grains slightly\r\ndamaged crystals of felspar, chiefly orthoclase. Many portions of these\r\nfelspathic grits much resemble the detrital Cambrian rocks which in\r\nthe Vale of Llanberis have been made out of the pale felsite of that\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: Mr. Watts also examined the microscopic structure of\r\nthe felsite of Benaun More. He found that the spherulites appear\r\nto have a micropegmatitic structure, owing to the intergrowth of\r\nquartz and felspar. In some parts of the rock the spherulites, from\r\n·02 to ·01 inch in diameter, are surrounded by exceedingly minute\r\ngreen needles, possibly of hornblende, while inside some of them are\r\nsmall quartz-grains. Larger porphyritic felspars occur outside the\r\nspherulites, some being of plagioclase, but most of orthoclase. The\r\nspherulitic structure is not so well developed near the felspars. A few\r\nof the large nodules are hollow and lined with crystals, while some of\r\nthem show a finely concentric lamination like the successive layers of\r\nan agate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE UPPER OLD RED SANDSTONE--THE SOUTH-WEST OF IRELAND,\r\nTHE NORTH OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the northern half of Britain, where the Old Red Sandstone is so\r\nwell displayed, the two great divisions into which this series of\r\nsedimentary deposits is there divisible are separated from each other\r\nby a strongly marked unconformability. The interval of time represented\r\nby this break must have been of long duration, for it witnessed\r\nthe effacement of the old water-basins, the folding, fracture, and\r\nelevation of their thick sedimentary and volcanic accumulations, and\r\nthe removal by denudation of, in some places, several thousand feet\r\nof these rocks. The Upper Old Red Sandstone, consisting so largely as\r\nit does of red sandstones and conglomerates, indicates the return or\r\npersistence of geographical conditions not unlike those that marked\r\nthe deposition of the lower subdivision. But in one important respect\r\nits history differs greatly from that which I have sketched for the\r\nolder part of the system. Though the Upper Old Red Sandstone is well\r\ndeveloped across the southern districts of Scotland from the Ochil\r\nto the Cheviot Hills, and appears in scattered areas over so much of\r\nEngland and Wales, no trace has ever been there detected in it of any\r\ncontemporaneously erupted volcanic rocks. The topographical changes\r\nwhich preceded its deposition must have involved no inconsiderable\r\namount of subterranean disturbance, yet the volcanic energy, which had\r\ndied out so completely long before the close of the time of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, does not appear to have been rekindled until the\r\nbeginning of the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nTwo widely separated tracts in the British Isles have yielded traces of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic rocks in the Upper Old Red Sandstone. One of\r\nthese lies in the south-west of Ireland, the other in the far north of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH-WEST OF IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe Irish locality is situated a few miles to the south of the town\r\nof Limerick, where the Carboniferous Limestone has been thrown into\r\nlong folds, and where, along the anticlines, strips of the underlying\r\nred sandstones have been brought up to the surface. Two such ridges\r\nof Upper Old Red Sandstone bear, each on its crest, a small but\r\ninteresting relic of volcanic activity[394] (Map I.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: See Sheet 153 of the Geological Survey of Ireland, and\r\nExplanation to that Sheet (1861), by Messrs. G. H. Kinahan and J.\r\nO'Kelly. The account of the ground above given is from notes which I\r\nmade during a personal visit.]\r\n\r\nThe more northerly ridge rises in the conical eminence of Knockfeerina\r\nto a height of 949 feet above the sea. Even from a distance the\r\nresemblance of this hill (Fig. 102) to many of the Carboniferous necks\r\nof Scotland at once attracts the eye of the geologist. The resemblance\r\nis found to hold still more closely when the internal structure of the\r\nground is examined. The cone consists mainly of a coarse agglomerate,\r\nwith blocks generally somewhat rounded and varying in size up to two\r\nfeet in length. The most prominent of these, on the lower eastern\r\nslopes, are pieces of a fine flinty felsite weathering white, but there\r\nalso occur fragments of grit and baked shale. The matrix is dull-green\r\nin colour, and among its ingredients are abundant small lapilli of a\r\nfinely vesicular andesite or diabase. These more basic ingredients\r\nincrease in number towards the top of the eminence, where much of\r\nthe agglomerate is almost wholly made up of them. No marked dip is\r\nobservable over most of the hill, the rock appearing as a tumultuous\r\nagglomerate, though here and there, particularly near the top and on\r\nthe south side, a rude bedding may be detected dipping outwards. On the\r\nwest side the agglomerate is flanked with yellow sandstone baked into\r\nquartzite, so that the line of junction there between the two rocks not\r\nimprobably gives us the actual wall of the vent. The induration of the\r\nsurrounding sandstones is a familiar feature among the Carboniferous\r\nvents. Some intrusive dark flinty rock traverses the agglomerate near\r\nthe top on the north side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--View of Knockfeerina, Limerick, from the\r\nnorth-east--a volcanic neck of Upper Old Red Sandstone age.]\r\n\r\nRetiring eastwards from the cone, the observer finds evidence of the\r\nintercalation of tuff among the surrounding Upper Old Red Sandstone.\r\nAt the east end of the village of Knockfeerina a red nodular tuff,\r\nwith rounded pieces of andesite, grit and sandstone, sometimes 12\r\ninches long, is seen to dip under yellow, grey and red sandstones and\r\nshales, while other shales and sandstones underlie this tuff and crop\r\nout between it and the agglomerate. There is thus evidence of the\r\nintercalation of volcanic tuff in the Upper Old Red Sandstone of this\r\ndistrict. And there seems no reason to doubt that the tuff was ejected\r\nfrom the adjoining vent of Knockfeerina.\r\n\r\nOn the next ridge of Old Red Sandstone, which runs parallel to that\r\nof Knockfeerina at a distance of little more than a mile to the\r\nsouth, another mass of volcanic material rises into a prominence at\r\nBallinleeny. On the north side it consists of agglomerate like that\r\njust described, and is flanked by sandstone baked into quartzite. Here\r\nagain we probably see the edge of a volcanic funnel. There may possibly\r\nbe more than one vent in this area. But well-bedded tuffs can be\r\nobserved to dip away from the centre and to pass under sandstones and\r\nshales which are full of fine ashy material. Gradations can be traced\r\nfrom the tuff into ordinary sediment. In this instance, therefore,\r\nthere is additional proof of contemporaneous volcanic action in the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone. There can be no uncertainty as to the horizon\r\nof the strata in which these records have been preserved, for they\r\ndip conformably under the shales and limestones at the base of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series. They are said to have yielded the\r\ncharacteristic fern _Palæopteris_ of Kiltorcan.[395]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: There may be some other examples of Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone volcanic rocks in Ireland which I have not yet been able\r\npersonally to examine. On the maps of the Geological Survey (Sheet\r\n198, and Explanation, pp. 8, 17) contemporaneous rocks of this age are\r\nmarked as occurring at Cod's Head and Dursey Island, on the south side\r\nof the mouth of the Kenmare estuary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nThe only district in England or Scotland wherein traces of volcanic\r\naction during the time of the Upper Old Red Sandstone have been\r\nobserved lies far to the north among the Orkney Islands, near the\r\ncentre of the scattered outliers which I have united as parts of the\r\ndeposits of \"Lake Orcadie\"[396] (Map I.). The thick group of yellow and\r\nred sandstones which form most of the high island of Hoy, and which,\r\nthere can be little doubt, are correctly referred to the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone, rest with a marked unconformability on the edges of the\r\nCaithness flagstones (Fig. 103). At the base of these pale sandstones,\r\nand regularly interstratified with them, lies a band of lavas and tuffs\r\nwhich can be traced from the base of the rounded hills to the edge of\r\nthe cliffs at the Cam, along the face of which it runs as a conspicuous\r\nfeature, gradually sloping to a lower level, till it reaches the sea.\r\nAt the Cam of Hoy it is about 200 feet thick, and consists of three or\r\nmore sheets of andesite. The upper 50 or 60 feet show a strongly slaggy\r\nstructure, the central portion is rudely columnar, and the lower part\r\npresents a kind of horizontal jointing or bedding. There can be no\r\nquestion that this rock is not a sill but a group of contemporaneous\r\nlava-flows. Beneath it, and lying across the edges of the flagstones\r\nbelow, there is a zone of dull-red, fine-grained tuff, banded with\r\nseams of hard red and yellow sandstone. This tuff zone dies out to the\r\neastward of the Cam.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: First noticed in _Geol. Mag._ February 1878; and _Trans.\r\nRoy. Soc. Edin._ xxviii. (1878), p. 411.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 103.--Section of the volcanic zone in the Upper Old Red\r\n     Sandstone, Cam of Hoy, Orkney.\r\n\r\n  1. Caithness flagstones; 2. Dull-red tuff and bands of sandstone;\r\n     3. Lava zone in three bands; 4. Yellow and red sandstone.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--Section of the volcanic zone in the Upper Old\r\nRed Sandstone at Black Ness, Rackwick, Hoy.]\r\n\r\nA few miles south of the Cam the volcanic zone appears again as the\r\nplatform on which the picturesque natural obelisk of the Old Man of Hoy\r\nstands. Here the lava runs out as a promontory from the base of the\r\ncliff, and on this projection the Old Man has been left isolated from\r\nthe main precipice. The cliffs of Hoy are traversed by numerous small\r\nfaults which have shifted the volcanic zone. But on the great face of\r\nrock behind the Old Man there appears to be a second volcanic zone\r\nlying several hundred feet above that just described. It is probably\r\nthis upper zone which emerges from under the hills a mile and a half\r\nto the south at Black Ness in the bay of Rackwick. A good section is\r\nthere visible, which is represented in Fig. 104. The ordinary red and\r\nyellow sandstones (_a_) appear from under the volcanic rocks at this\r\nlocality, and stretch southwards to the most southerly headland of Hoy.\r\nThe lowest volcanic band in the section is one of red sandy well-bedded\r\ntuffs (_b_). Some of the layers are coarse and almost agglomeratic,\r\nwhile others are fine marly and sandy, with dispersed bombs, blocks\r\nand lapilli of diabase and andesite. Hard ribs of a sandy tufaceous\r\nmaterial also occur. These fragmental deposits are immediately overlain\r\nby a dark-blue rudely prismatic diabase with slaggy top (_c_). It is\r\nabout 150 feet thick at its thickest part, but rapidly thins away in a\r\nwesterly direction. It passes under a zone of red tuff (_d_) like that\r\nbelow, and above this highest member of the volcanic group comes the\r\ngreat overlying pile of yellow and reddish sandstone of Hoy. Followed\r\nwestward for a short distance, the whole volcanic zone is found to die\r\nout and the sandstones below and above it then come together.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this little volcanic centre in Hoy is heightened by\r\nthe fact that the progress of denudation has revealed some of the\r\nvents belonging to it. On the low ground to the east of the Cam, and\r\nimmediately to the north of the volcanic escarpment, the flagstones\r\nwhich there emerge from under the base of the unconformable upper\r\nsandstones are pierced by three volcanic necks which we may with little\r\nhesitation recognize as marking the sites of vents from which this\r\nseries of lavas and tuffs was discharged (Fig. 105). The largest of\r\nthem forms a conspicuous hill about 450 feet high, the smallest is only\r\na few yards in diameter, and rises from the surface of a flagstone\r\nridge. They are filled with a coarse, dull-green, volcanic agglomerate,\r\nmade up of fragments of the lavas with pieces of hardened yellow\r\nsandstone and flagstone. Around the chief vent the flagstones through\r\nwhich it has been opened have been greatly hardened and blistered. The\r\nmost easterly vent, which has been laid bare on the beach at Bring, due\r\neast of Hoy Hill, can be seen to pierce the flagstones, which, although\r\ntheir general dip is westerly at from 10° to 15°, yet at their junction\r\nwith the agglomerate are bent in towards the neck, and are otherwise\r\nmuch jumbled and disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--Section across the volcanic band and its\r\nassociated necks, Hoy, Orkney.\r\n\r\n  1.

It is filled with a coarse\r\nagglomerate consisting of a dull-greenish diabase paste crowded with\r\nblocks of diabase, sometimes three feet in diameter, and others of red\r\nsandstone, flagstone, limestone, gneiss and lumps of black cleavable\r\naugite (Fig. 106).[397] The sandstones around it present the usual\r\ndisrupted, indurated and jointed character, and are traversed by a\r\nsmall diabase dyke close to the western margin of the neck. Another\r\nsimilar neck has since been found by the officers of the Geological\r\nSurvey on the same coast. That these volcanic orifices were active\r\nabout the same time with those in the opposite island of Hoy may be\r\nlegitimately inferred.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: See _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxviii.

So far as the\r\nfragmentary nature of the geological evidence permits an opinion to\r\nbe formed, they seem to have broken out at the beginning, or at least\r\nat an early stage, of the deposition of the Upper Old Red Sandstone,\r\nand to have become entirely extinct after the lavas of Hoy were poured\r\nforth. No higher platform of volcanic materials has been met with in\r\nthat region. With these brief and limited Orcadian explosions the\r\nlong record of Old Red Sandstone volcanic activity in the area of the\r\nBritish Isles comes to an end.[398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: There appear to be traces of volcanic eruptions\r\ncontemporaneous with the Upper Old Red Sandstone of Berwickshire,\r\nbut as they merely formed a prelude to the great volcanic activity\r\nof Carboniferous time, they are included in the account of the\r\nCarboniferous plateau of Berwickshire in Chapters xxiv. and xxv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM OF BRITAIN AND ITS VOLCANIC RECORDS\r\n\r\n  Geography and Scenery of the Carboniferous Period--Range of\r\n     Volcanic Eruptions during that time--I.

We learn from it that the\r\nlocal basins of deposit in which the later portion of the Old Red\r\nSandstone was accumulated sank steadily in a wide general subsidence,\r\nthat allowed the clear sea of the Carboniferous Limestone ultimately\r\nto spread for some 700 miles from the west coast of Ireland into\r\nWestphalia. Over the centre of England this Carboniferous Mediterranean\r\nhad a breadth of at least 150 miles, gradually shallowing northwards\r\nin the direction of land in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The gentle\r\nsinking of the floor of the basin continued until more than 6000 feet\r\nof sediment, chiefly composed of the remains of crinoids, corals and\r\nother marine organisms, had been piled up in the deeper parts. Traces\r\nof the southern margin of this sea, or at least of a long insular ridge\r\nthat rose out of its waters, are to be seen in the protuberances of\r\nolder rocks which appear at intervals from under the Coal-measures\r\nand later formations between the borders of Wales and the heart of\r\nLeicestershire, and of which the crags of Charnwood Forest are among\r\nthe few peaks that still remain visible. To the south of this ridge,\r\nopen sea extended far southward and westward over the site of the\r\nMendip Hills and the uplands of South Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous period, as chronicled by its sedimentary deposits,\r\nwas a time of slow submergence and quiet sedimentation, terrestrial\r\nand marine conditions alternating along the margins of the sinking\r\nland, according as the rate of depression surpassed or fell short of\r\nthat of the deposition of sediment. There is no trace of any general\r\ndisturbance among the strata, such as would be marked by an important\r\nand widely extended unconformability. But many indications may be\r\nobserved that the rate of subsidence did not continue uniform, if,\r\nindeed, the downward movement was not locally arrested, and even\r\nexchanged for a movement in the opposite direction. It is difficult,\r\nfor instance, to believe the ancient ridge of the Midlands to have\r\nbeen so lofty that even the prolonged subsidence required for the\r\naccumulation of the whole Carboniferous system was insufficient to\r\ncarry its highest crests below the level of the coal-jungles. More\r\nprobably the depression reached its maximum along certain lines or\r\nbands running in a general north-easterly direction, the intervals\r\nbetween these lines sinking less, or possibly even undergoing some\r\nmeasure of uplift. One of the subsiding tracts, that of the wide\r\nlowlands of Central Scotland, was flanked on the south by a ridge\r\nwhich, while its north-eastern portion was buried under the Upper Old\r\nRed Sandstone and Lower Carboniferous rocks, remained above water\r\ntowards the south-west, and does not appear to have been wholly\r\nsubmerged there even at the close of the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nSo abundant and varied are the sedimentary formations of Carboniferous\r\ntime, and so fully have they preserved remains of the contemporary\r\nplants and animals, that it is not difficult to realise in some measure\r\nthe general aspect of the scenery of the time, and the succession of\r\nchanges which it underwent from the beginning to the end of the period.\r\nThe land was green with a luxuriant if somewhat monotonous vegetation.\r\nLarge pine trees flourished on the drier uplands. The lower grounds\r\nnourished dense groves of cycads or plants allied to them, which rose\r\nas slim trees twenty or thirty feet high, with long hard green leaves\r\nand catkins that grew into berries. The swamps and wetter lands bore a\r\nrank growth of various gigantic kinds of club-moss, equisetaceous reeds\r\nand ferns.\r\n\r\nNor was the hum of insect-life absent from these forests. Ancestral\r\ntypes of cockroaches, mayflies and beetles lived there. Scorpions\r\nswarmed along the margins of the shallow waters, for their remains,\r\nwashed away with the decayed vegetation among which they harboured, are\r\nnow found in abundance throughout many of the dark shales.\r\n\r\nThe waters were haunted by numerous kinds of fish quite distinct from\r\nthose of the Old Red Sandstone. In the lagoons, shoals of small ganoids\r\nlived on the cyprids that peopled the bottom, and they were in turn\r\npreyed on by larger ganoids with massive armature of bone. Now and\r\nthen a shark from the opener sea would find its way into these more\r\ninland waters. The highest types of animal life yet known to have\r\nexisted at this time were various amphibians of the extinct order of\r\nLabyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nThe open sea, too, teemed with life. Wide tracts of its floor supported\r\na thick growth of crinoids whose jointed stems, piled over each other\r\ngeneration after generation, grew into masses of limestone many\r\nhundreds of feet in thickness. Corals of various kinds lived singly and\r\nin colonies, here and there even growing into reefs. Foraminifera,\r\nsponges, sea-urchins, brachiopods, gasteropods, lamellibranchs and\r\ncephalopods, in many genera and species, mingled their remains with the\r\ndead crinoids and corals to furnish materials for the wide and thick\r\naccumulation of Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n\r\nLooking broadly at the history of the Carboniferous period, and bearing\r\nin mind the evidence of prolonged depression already referred to, we\r\ncan recognize in it three great eras. During the first, the wide clear\r\nsea of the Carboniferous Limestone spread over the centre and south\r\nof Britain, interrupted here and there by islands that rose from long\r\nridges whereby the sea-floor was divided into separate basins. Next\r\ncame a time of lessened depression, when the sea-bottom was overspread\r\nwith sand, mud and gravel, and was even in part silted up, as has been\r\nchronicled in the Millstone Grit. The third stage brings before us the\r\njungles of the Coal-measures, when the former sea-floor became a series\r\nof shallow lagoons where, as in the mangrove-swamps of our own time, a\r\nterrestrial vegetation sprang up and mingled its remains with those of\r\nmarine shells and fishes.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of balance among the geological forces as is indicated\r\nby the stratigraphy of the Carboniferous system would not prepare us\r\nfor the discovery of the relics of any serious display of contemporary\r\nvolcanic activity. And, indeed, throughout the Carboniferous rocks\r\nof Western Europe there is for the most part little trace of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic eruptions. Yet striking evidence exists that,\r\nalong the western borders of the continental area, in France as well\r\nas over much of Britain, which had for so many previous geological\r\nages been the theatre of subterranean activity, the older half of\r\nCarboniferous time witnessed an abundant, though less stupendous and\r\nprolonged, renewal of volcanic energy.\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of the Carboniferous period to the epoch\r\nwhen the Coal-measures began to be accumulated, the area of the British\r\nIsles continued to be a scene of active volcanism. In the course of\r\nthat prolonged interval of geological time the vents shifted their\r\npositions, and gradually grew less energetic, but there does not\r\nappear to have been any protracted section of the interval when the\r\nsubterranean activity became everywhere entirely quiescent.\r\n\r\nThe geologist who traces, from older to younger formations, the\r\nprogress of some persistent operation of nature, observes the evidence\r\ngradually to increase in amount and clearness as it is furnished\r\nby successively later parts of the record. He finds that the older\r\nrocks have generally been so dislocated and folded, and are often\r\nso widely covered by younger formations, that the evidence which\r\nthey no doubt actually contain may be difficult to decipher, or may\r\nbe altogether concealed from view. In following, for instance, the\r\nprogress of volcanic action, he is impressed, as he passes from the\r\nolder to the younger Palæozoic chronicles, by the striking contrast\r\nbetween the fulness and legibility of the Carboniferous records and the\r\ncomparative meagreness and obscurity of those of the earlier periods.\r\nThe Carboniferous rocks have undergone far less disturbance than the\r\nCambrian and Silurian formations; while over wide tracts, where their\r\nvolcanic chapters are fullest and most interesting, they lie at the\r\nsurface, and can thus be subjected to the closest scrutiny. Hence\r\nthe remains of the volcanic phenomena of the later Palæozoic periods\r\npresent a curiously modern aspect, when contrasted with the fragmentary\r\nand antique look of those of older date.\r\n\r\nThe history of volcanic action during the Carboniferous period in\r\nBritain is almost wholly comprised in the records of the earlier half\r\nof that period, that is, during the long interval represented by the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series and the Millstone Grit. It was chiefly\r\nin the northern part of the region that volcanic activity manifested\r\nitself. In Scotland there is the chronicle of a long succession of\r\neruptions across the district of the central and southern counties,\r\nfrom the very beginning of Carboniferous time down to the epoch when\r\nthe Coal-measures began to be accumulated. In England, on the other\r\nhand, the traces of Carboniferous volcanoes are confined within a\r\nlimited range in the Carboniferous Limestone, while in Ireland they\r\nappear to be likewise restricted to the same lower division of the\r\nsystem. During the whole of the vast interval represented by the\r\nCoal-measures volcanic energy, so far as at present known, was entirely\r\ndormant over the region of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThese general statements will be more clearly grasped from the\r\naccompanying table, which shows the various sections into which the\r\nCarboniferous system of Britain has been divided, and also, by black\r\nvertical lines, the range of volcanic intercalations in each of the\r\nthree kingdoms.\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n|                                         | England. | Scotland. | Ireland. |\r\n+-----------------------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n|Coal-measures.                           |          |           |          |\r\n|   { Upper Red Sandstones with           |          |           |          |\r\n|   {   _Spirorbis_-limestone.       |          |           |          |\r\n|   { Middle or chief coal-bearing        |          |           |          |\r\n|   {   measures.                         |          |           |          |\r\n|   { Gannister group.                    |          |           |          |\r\n|                                         |          |           |          |\r\n|Millstone Grit.                          |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   } Grits, flagstones and shales with   |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   } thin coals.                         |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|                                         |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|Carboniferous Limestone.                 |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   { Yoredale group of shales and grits  |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   {   with limestones.                  |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   { Thick (Scaur or Main) Limestone     |    ||    |     ||    |          |\r\n|   {   of England, with sandstones       |    ||    |     ||    |    ||    |\r\n|   {   and coals in Scotland.            |    ||    |     ||    |    ||    |\r\n|   { Lower Limestone Shale (Calciferous  |          |     ||    |          |\r\n|   {   Sandstones of Scotland).          |          |     ||    |          |\r\n+-----------------------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\nSuch being the general range in time of the Carboniferous volcanic\r\nphenomena, it may be convenient, in this preliminary survey, to take\r\nnote of the general distribution of the volcanic districts over the\r\nBritish Isles, as in this way we may best realise the extent and\r\ngrouping of the eruptions, which will then be considered in further\r\ndetail (see Map I.).\r\n\r\nNot only were the Carboniferous volcanoes most abundant and persistent\r\nin Scotland, but they attained there a variety and development which\r\ngive their remains an altogether exceptional interest in the study of\r\nvolcanic geology. They were distributed over the wide central valley,\r\nfrom the south of Cantyre to beyond the mouth of the estuary of the\r\nForth. On the southern side of the Silurian Uplands, they were likewise\r\nnumerous and active. There is thus no considerable tract of Lower\r\nCarboniferous rocks in Scotland which does not furnish its evidence of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic action.\r\n\r\nAlthough some portions of the Scottish Carboniferous igneous rocks run\r\nfor a short distance into England, it is remarkable that, when these at\r\nlast die out southwards, no other relics of contemporaneous volcanic\r\nenergy take their place. Along the Pennine chain, from the Border into\r\nthe heart of England, though natural sections are abundant, no trace of\r\nincluded volcanic rocks appears until we reach Derbyshire. The whole of\r\nthat wide interval of 150 miles, so far as the present evidence goes,\r\nremained during Carboniferous time entirely free from any volcanic\r\neruption. But from the picturesque country of the Peak southwards, the\r\nsea-floor of the Carboniferous Limestone, in what is now the heart\r\nof England, was dotted with vents whence the sheets of \"toadstone\"\r\nwere ejected, which have so long been a familiar feature in English\r\ngeology. Beyond this limited volcanic district the Carboniferous\r\nformations of the south-west of England remain, on the whole, devoid\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic intercalations, traces of Carboniferous\r\nvolcanic action having been recognized only in West Somerset and\r\nDevonshire. In the Mendip district and in the ridges of limestone near\r\nWeston-super-Mare bands of cellular lava and tuff have been observed.\r\nTo the west of Dartmoor, Brent Tor and some of the surrounding igneous\r\nmasses may mark the positions of eruptive vents during an early part of\r\nthe Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of the Isle of Man relics remain of a group of vents\r\namong the Carboniferous limestones. Passing across to Ireland, where\r\nthese limestones attain so great a thickness and cover so large\r\na proportion of the surface of the island, we search in vain for\r\nany continuation of the abundant and varied volcanic phenomena of\r\nCentral Scotland. So far as observation has yet gone, only two widely\r\nseparated areas of Carboniferous volcanic rocks are known to occur\r\nin Ireland.[399] One of these shows that a little group of vents\r\nprobably rose from the floor of the Carboniferous Limestone sea, near\r\nPhilipstown, in King's County. The other lies far to the west in the\r\nGolden Vale of Limerick, where a more important series of vents poured\r\nout successive streams of lava with showers of ashes, from an early\r\npart of the Carboniferous period up to about the beginning of the time\r\nof the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: The supposed Carboniferous volcanic rocks of Bearhaven\r\non the coast of Cork are noticed on p. 49, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nThe total area within which the volcanic eruptions of Carboniferous\r\ntime took place was thus less than that over which the volcanoes of\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone were distributed, yet they were scattered\r\nacross the larger part of the site of the British Isles. From the vents\r\nof Fife to those of Limerick is a distance of above 300 miles; from the\r\nlatter eastward to those of Devonshire is an interval of 250 miles;\r\nwhile the space between the Devonshire volcanoes and those of Fife is\r\nabout 400 miles. In this triangular space volcanic action manifested\r\nitself at each of the apices, to a slight extent along the centre of\r\nthe eastern side, but with much the greatest vigour throughout the\r\nnorthern part of the area.\r\n\r\nSince the volcanic phenomena of Carboniferous time are exhibited on\r\na much more extensive scale in Scotland than in any other region of\r\nthe world yet studied, it will be desirable to describe that area in\r\nconsiderable detail. The other tracts in Britain where volcanic rocks\r\nof the same age occur need not be so fully treated, except where they\r\nhelp to a better comprehension of the general volcanic history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is in the southern half of Scotland that the Carboniferous system is\r\ndeveloped (Map IV.). A line drawn from Machrihanish Bay, near the Mull\r\nof Cantyre, north-eastward across Arran and Bute to the south end of\r\nLoch Lomond, and thence eastward by Bridge of Allan, Kinross and Cupar\r\nto St. Andrews Bay, forms the northern limit of this system. South of\r\nthat line Carboniferous volcanic intercalations are to be met with in\r\nnearly every county across into the borders of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThat we may follow intelligently the remarkably varied volcanic history\r\nof this region, it is desirable to begin by taking note of the nature\r\nand sequence of the sedimentary formations among which the volcanic\r\nrocks are intercalated, for these serve to bring before us the general\r\nconditions of the geography of the period. The subjoined table exhibits\r\nthe subdivisions into which the Carboniferous system in Scotland has\r\nbeen grouped:--\r\n\r\n  Coal-measures.\r\n    { Upper Red Sandstone group, nearly devoid of coal-seams.\r\n    {\r\n    { Coal-bearing, white, yellow and grey sandstones, dark shales and\r\n    {  ironstones (Upper Coal series).\r\n\r\n  Millstone Grit.\r\n    { Thick white and reddish sandstones and grits.\r\n\r\n  Carboniferous Limestone series.\r\n    { Sandstones, shales, fireclays, coal-seams, ironstones and three seams\r\n    {  of marine limestone, of which the uppermost is known as the\r\n    {  Castlecary seam, the second as the Calmy or Arden, and the lowest\r\n    {  as the Index (Lower Coal series).\r\n    {\r\n    { Bands of marine limestone intercalated among sandstones, shales and\r\n    {  some coal-seams. A thick band of limestone lying at or near the\r\n    {  bottom of the group, traceable all over Central Scotland, is known\r\n    {  as the Hurlet or Main Limestone. Some higher and thinner seams are\r\n    {  called Hosie's (see Fig. 155).\r\n\r\n  Calciferous Sandstones.[400]\r\n    { In the basin of the Firth of Forth, below the Hurlet Limestone, comes\r\n    {   a varied series of white and yellow sandstones, black shales\r\n    {   (oil-shales), cyprid shales and limestones (Burdiehouse), and\r\n    {   occasional coal-seams (Houston), having a total depth of about 3000\r\n    {   feet. This local group abounds in fossil plants, entomostraca and\r\n    {   ganoid fishes. It passes down into the Cement-stone group, which,\r\n    {   however, is feebly developed in this district, unless it is partly\r\n    {   represented by the sandstones, shales, limestones and coals just\r\n    {   mentioned.\r\n    { Cement-stone group consisting of red, blue and green marls and\r\n    {   shales, red and grey sandstones, and thin bands of cement-stone:\r\n    {   fossils scarce.\r\n    { Reddish and grey sandstones and shales, with occasional plant-\r\n    {   remains, passing down into the deep red (sometimes yellow)\r\n    {   sandstones, red marls and cornstones of the Upper Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: The Calciferous Sandstones are the stratigraphical\r\nequivalents of the Limestone Shale and lower portion of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone of England.]\r\n\r\nFrom this table the gradual geographical evolution of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod in Scotland may be gleaned. We observe that at the beginning,\r\nthe conditions under which the Old Red Sandstone had been accumulated\r\nstill in part continued. The great lacustrine basins of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone had indeed been effaced, and their sites were occupied\r\nby comparatively shallow areas of fresh or brackish water in which\r\nthe Upper Old Red Sandstone was laid down. Their conglomerates and\r\nsandstones had been uplifted and fractured. Their vast ranges of\r\nvolcanic material, after being deeply buried under sediment, had\r\nbeen once more laid bare, and extended as ridges of land, separating\r\nthe pools and lagoons which they supplied with sand and silt. This\r\nsingular topography had not been entirely effaced at the beginning of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, for we find that many of the ridges which\r\nbounded the basins of the Upper Old Red Sandstone remained as land\r\nuntil they sank beneath the waters in which the earliest Carboniferous\r\nstrata accumulated. Thus, while no trace of an unconformability has\r\nyet been detected at the top of the Upper Old Red Sandstone, there is\r\noften a strong overlap of the succeeding deposits. At the south end of\r\nthe Pentland Hills, for example, the Upper Old Red Sandstone attains a\r\nthickness of 1000 feet, but only three miles further south it entirely\r\ndisappears, together with all the overlying mass of Calciferous\r\nSandstones, and the Carboniferous Limestone then rests directly on the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone. Again, at the north end of the same chain the\r\nupper division of the Old Red Sandstone dies out against the lower,\r\nwhich is eventually overlapped by the Calciferous Sandstones.\r\n\r\nThe change from the physical conditions of the Scottish Old Red\r\nSandstone to those of the Carboniferous system was no doubt gradual\r\nand slow. The peculiar red sandy sediment continued to be laid down\r\nin basins that were apparently being gradually widened by access of\r\nwater from the open sea. Yet it would seem that in Scotland these\r\nbasins still for a long time continued saline or, from some other\r\ncause, unfavourable to life; for the red, blue and green shales or\r\nmarls, and occasional impure limestones or cement-stones and gypseous\r\nlayers, which were deposited in them, are in general unfossiliferous,\r\nthough drifted plants from the neighbouring land are here and there\r\ncommon enough. The sediments of these early Carboniferous waters are\r\nmet with all over the southern half of Scotland, but in very unequal\r\ndevelopment, and constitute what is known as the \"Cement-stone Group.\"\r\n\r\nIt was while these strata were in course of deposition that the\r\nearliest Carboniferous volcanoes broke into eruption. In some\r\nlocalities a thickness of several hundred feet of the Cement-stone\r\ngroup underlies the lowest lavas. In other places the lavas occur in\r\nand rest on the Upper Old Red Sandstone and have the Cement-stone group\r\nwholly above them; while in yet other districts the volcanic rocks seem\r\nentirely to take the place of that group. So vigorous was the earliest\r\ndisplay of volcanic action in Carboniferous times that from the borders\r\nof Northumberland to the uplands of Galloway, and from the slopes of\r\nthe Lammermuirs to Stirlingshire and thence across the estuary of the\r\nClyde to Cantyre, innumerable vents were opened and large bodies of\r\nlava and ashes were ejected.\r\n\r\nThe Cement-stone group, save where succeeded by volcanic\r\nintercalations, passes up conformably into the lowest crinoidal\r\nlimestones of the Carboniferous Limestone series. In the basin of the\r\nFirth of Forth, however, the cement-stones, feebly represented there,\r\nare overlain by a remarkable assemblage of white sandstones, black\r\ncarbonaceous shales, or \"oil-shales,\" cyprid limestones, occasional\r\nmarine limestones and thin seams of coal, the whole having a thickness\r\nof more than 3000 feet. These strata, unlike the typical Cement-stone\r\ngroup, abound in fossils both vegetable and animal. They prove that,\r\nover the area of the Forth, the insalubrious basins wherein the red and\r\ngreen sediments of the Cement-stone group were laid down, gave place\r\nto opener and clearer water with occasional access of the sea. The\r\npeculiar lagoon-conditions which favoured the formation of coal were\r\nthus developed in Central Scotland earlier than elsewhere in Britain.\r\nWe shall see in later pages that these conditions were accompanied by a\r\nfresh outbreak of volcanic activity, in a phase less vigorous but more\r\nenduring and extensive than that of the first Carboniferous eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous Limestone sea over the site of the southern half of\r\nScotland appears never to have reached the depth which it attained in\r\nEngland and Ireland. To the north of it lay the land from which large\r\nquantities of sand and mud were carried into it, as shown by the deep\r\naccumulations of sandstone and shale, which far surpass in thickness\r\nthe few comparatively thin marine limestones intercalated in them.\r\nThere is thus a striking contrast between the thick masses of limestone\r\nin central and south-western England and their dwindled representatives\r\nin the north. Another marked difference between the Scottish and\r\nEnglish developments of this formation is to be noticed in the abundant\r\nproof that the comparatively shallow waters of the northern basin were\r\nplentifully dotted over with active volcanoes. The eruptions were\r\nespecially vigorous and prolonged in the basin of the Firth of Forth.\r\nThey continued at intervals, even after the peculiar geographical\r\nconditions of the Carboniferous Limestone had ceased. But they had died\r\nout by the time of the beginning of the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\nOwing to the number and variety of the natural sections, the\r\nCarboniferous volcanic rocks of Scotland have been the subject of\r\nnumerous observations and descriptions, from the early days of geology\r\ndown to the present time. The mere enumeration of the titles of the\r\nvarious publications regarding them would make a long list. These\r\nrocks formed the subject of some of Hutton's early observations,\r\nand furnished him with facts from which he established the igneous\r\norigin of \"whinstone.\"[401] They supplied Playfair with numerous apt\r\nillustrations in support of Hutton's views, and he seems to have made\r\nhimself thoroughly familiar with them.[402] In the hands of Sir James\r\nHall they became the groundwork of those remarkable experiments on the\r\nfusion of whinstone which may be said to have laid the foundation of\r\nexperimental geology.[403] In the controversies of the Neptunian and\r\nPlutonian schools these rocks were frequently appealed to by each side\r\nin confirmation of its dogmas. The appointment in 1804 of Jameson to\r\nthe Chair of Natural History in the Edinburgh University gave increased\r\nimpetus to the study of the igneous rocks of Scotland. Though he did\r\nnot himself publish much regarding them, we know that he was constantly\r\nin the habit of conducting his class to the hills, ravines and quarries\r\naround Edinburgh, and that the views which he taught were imbibed\r\nand extended by his pupils.[404] Among the early writers the names\r\nof Allan,[405] Townson,[406] Lord Greenock,[407] and Ami Boué,[408]\r\ndeserve especial mention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: Hutton's _Theory of the Earth_, vol. i. p. 155 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: Playfair's _Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory_, §\r\n255 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: _Trans.

To these he added \"Trap-tufa,\" which\r\nhe considered to be identical in origin with modern volcanic tuff. It\r\nwas the eruptive character of the igneous rocks on which he specially\r\ndwelt, showing by numerous sections the effects which the protrusion\r\nof the molten masses have had upon the surrounding rocks. He did not\r\nattempt to separate the intrusive from the interstratified sheets, nor\r\nto form a chronological arrangement of the whole.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: _Mem. Wern. Soc._ vii. p. 1. Published separately, 1838.]\r\n\r\nStill more important was the sketch given by Maclaren, in his classic\r\n_Geology of Fife and the Lothians_.[410] This author clearly recognized\r\nthat many of the igneous rocks were thrown out contemporaneously with\r\nthe strata among which they now lie. He constantly sought for analogies\r\namong modern volcanic phenomena, and presented the Carboniferous\r\nigneous rocks of the Lothians not as so many petrographical varieties,\r\nbut as monuments of different phases of volcanic action previous to\r\nthe formation of the Coal-measures. His detailed descriptions of Arthur\r\nSeat and the rocks immediately around Edinburgh, which alone the work\r\nwas originally intended to embrace, may be cited as models of exact and\r\nluminous research. The portions referring to the rest of the basin of\r\nthe Forth did not profess to be more than a mere sketch of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Small 8vo, Edin. 1838, first partly published as\r\narticles in the _Scotsman_ newspaper. A second edition, which was\r\nlittle more than a reprint of the first, appeared in 1866.]\r\n\r\nVarious papers of more local interest, to some of which allusion will\r\nbe made in the sequel, appeared during the next quarter of a century.\r\nBut no systematic study of the volcanic phenomena of any part of\r\nScotland was resumed until the extension in 1854 of the Geological\r\nSurvey to the north of the Tweed by A. C. Ramsay. The volcanic rocks\r\nof the Lothians and Fife were mapped by Mr. H. H. Howell and myself.\r\nThe maps of that district began to be published in the year 1859, and\r\nthe Memoirs two years later. In 1861, in a chronological grouping of\r\nthe whole of the volcanic phenomena of Scotland, I gave an outline of\r\nthe Carboniferous eruptions.[411] By degrees the detailed mapping of\r\nthe Geological Survey was pushed across the whole of the rest of the\r\nsouth of Scotland, and the Carboniferous volcanic rocks of each area\r\nwere then for the first time carefully traced and assigned to their\r\nvarious stratigraphical horizons. In the following pages reference will\r\nbe given to the more important features of the Survey maps and Memoirs.\r\nIn the year 1879, availing myself of the large amount of information\r\nwhich my own traverses and the work of the Survey had enabled me to\r\nacquire, I published a Memoir on the geology and petrography of the\r\nvolcanic rocks of the basin of the Firth of Forth;[412] and lastly,\r\nin my Presidential Address to the Geological Society in 1892, I gave\r\na summary of all that had then been ascertained on the subject of the\r\nvolcanic rocks of Carboniferous time in the British Isles.[413]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: _Ibid._ vol. xxix. (1879), p. 437.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlviii. (1892), p. 104. This\r\nsummary, with additional details and illustrations, is embodied in the\r\ntext.]\r\n\r\nTwo well-marked types of volcanic accumulations are recognizable in the\r\nBritish Isles, which may be conveniently termed Plateaux and Puys.\r\n\r\n1. Plateaux.--In this type, the volcanic materials were discharged\r\nover wide tracts of country, so that they now form broad tablelands\r\nor ranges of hills, reaching sometimes an extent of many hundreds\r\nof square miles and a thickness of more than 1000 feet. Plateaux of\r\nthis character occur within the British area only in Scotland, where\r\nthey are the predominant phase of volcanic intercalations in the\r\nCarboniferous system.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Carboniferous plateaux appeared during a\r\nwell-marked interval of geological time. The earliest examples of them\r\ndate from the close of the Upper Old Red Sandstone. They were all in\r\nvigorous eruption during the time of the Calciferous Sandstones, but in\r\nno case did they survive into that of the Hurlet and later limestones.\r\nThey are thus eminently characteristic of the earliest portion of the\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\n2. Puys.--In this type, the ejections were often confined to the\r\ndischarge of a small amount of fragmentary materials from a single\r\nsolitary vent, and even where the vents were more numerous and the\r\noutpourings of lava and showers of ash more copious, the ejected\r\nmaterial usually covered only a small area round the centres of\r\neruption. Occasionally streams of basic lava and accumulations of\r\ntuff were piled up into long ridges. Volcanoes of this character\r\nwere specially abundant in the basin of the Firth of Forth, and more\r\nsparingly in Ayrshire and Roxburghshire. They form the persistent type\r\nthroughout the rest of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe Puys also occupy a well-defined stratigraphical position. They did\r\nnot begin until some of the volcanic plateaux had become extinct. From\r\nthe top of the Cement-stone group up into the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries, their lavas and tuffs are met with on many platforms, but none\r\noccur above that series save in Ayrshire, where some of the eruptions\r\nappear to have been as late as about the beginning of the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\nArranged in tabular form the stratigraphical and geographical\r\ndistribution of the two great volcanic types of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem in Scotland will be more easily followed. I have therefore drawn\r\nup the accompanying scheme:--\r\n\r\n  Location Key:\r\n      A. Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.\r\n      B. Stirlingshire.\r\n      C. West Lothian.\r\n      D.

The Plateau-type restricted to Scotland--i. Distribution in the\r\n     Different Areas of Eruption--ii. Nature of the Materials erupted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the division of the Plateaux I group all the more copious eruptions\r\nduring the Carboniferous period, when the fragmentary materials\r\ngenerally formed but a small part of the discharges, but when the\r\nlavas were poured out so abundantly and frequently as to form\r\nlava-fields sometimes more than 2000 square miles in area, and to\r\nbuild up piles of volcanic material sometimes upwards of 3000 feet\r\nin thickness. As already remarked, this phase of volcanic action,\r\nespecially characteristic of the earlier part of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod across the south of Scotland, but not found elsewhere in the\r\nsame system in Britain, preceded the type of the Puys. Its eruptions\r\nextended from about the close of the Old Red Sandstone period through\r\nthat section of Carboniferous time which was marked by the deposition\r\nof the Calciferous Sandstones, but they entirely ceased before the\r\naccumulation of the Main or Hurlet Limestone, at the base of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone Series of Scotland. Its stratigraphical\r\nlimits, however, are not everywhere the same. In the eastern part of\r\nthe region, the lavas appear to be intercalated with, and certainly\r\nlie directly upon, the Upper Old Red Sandstone containing scales of\r\n_Bothriolepis_ and other characteristic fishes, and they are covered by\r\nthe Cement-stone group of the Calciferous Sandstones. In the western\r\ndistrict a considerable thickness of Carboniferous strata sometimes\r\nunderlies the volcanic sheets. On the other hand, the type of the Puys,\r\nalthough it appeared in Fife, Linlithgowshire and Midlothian during\r\nthe time of the Calciferous Sandstones, attained its chief development\r\nduring that of the Carboniferous Limestone, and did not finally die out\r\nin Ayrshire until the beginning of the deposition of the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. DISTRIBUTION OF THE PLATEAUX\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the effects of many powerful faults and extensive\r\ndenudation, the general position of the Plateaux and their independence\r\nof each other can still be traced. They are entirely confined, as I\r\nhave said, to the southern half of Scotland (see Map IV.). In noting\r\ntheir situations we are once more brought face to face with the\r\nremarkable fact, so strikingly manifested in the geological history of\r\nBritain, that volcanic action has been apt to recur again and again\r\nin or near to the same areas. The Carboniferous volcanic plateaux\r\nwere poured out from vents, some of which not impossibly rose among\r\nthe extinct vents of the Old Red Sandstone. Another fact, to which\r\nalso I have already alluded as partially recognizable in the records\r\nof Old Red Sandstone volcanism, now becomes increasingly evident--the\r\ntendency of volcanic vents to be opened along lines of valley rather\r\nthan over tracts of hill. The vents that supplied the materials of\r\nthe largest of the Carboniferous volcanic plateaux broke forth, like\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone volcanoes, along the broad Midland Valley of\r\nScotland, between the ridge of the Highlands on the north and that of\r\nthe Southern Uplands on the south. Others appeared in the long hollow\r\nbetween the southern side of these uplands, and the Cheviot Hills\r\nand hills of the Lake District. It is not a question of the rise of\r\nvolcanic vents merely along lines of fault, but over broad tracts of\r\nlow ground rather than on the surrounding or neighbouring heights. It\r\ncan easily be shown that this distribution is not the result of better\r\npreservation in the valleys and greater denudation from the higher\r\ngrounds, for, as has been already remarked in regard to the volcanoes\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone, these higher grounds are singularly free\r\nfrom traces of necks which, had any vents ever existed there, would\r\ncertainly have remained as memorials of them. The following summary of\r\nthe position and extent of the Plateaux will afford some idea of their\r\ngeneral characters:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--View of the escarpment of the Clyde Plateau\r\nin the Little Cumbrae, from the south-west.]\r\n\r\n1. The Clyde Plateau.--The chief plateau rises into one of the most\r\nconspicuous features in the scenery of Central Scotland. Beginning at\r\nStirling, it forms the tableland of the Fintry, Kilsyth, Campsie and\r\nKilpatrick Hills, stretching westwards to the Clyde near Dumbarton.\r\nIt rises again on the south side of that river, sweeping southwards\r\ninto the hilly moorlands which range from Greenock to Ardrossan, and\r\nspreading eastwards along the high watershed between Renfrewshire,\r\nAyrshire, and Lanarkshire to Galston and Strathavon. But it is not\r\nconfined to the mainland, for its prolongation can be traced down the\r\nbroad expanse of the Firth of Clyde by the islands of Cumbrae to the\r\nsouthern end of Bute, and thence by the east of Arran to Campbeltown in\r\nCantyre. Its visible remnants thus extend for more than 100 miles from\r\nnorth-east to south-west, with a width of some thirty-five miles in\r\nthe broadest part. We shall probably not exaggerate if we estimate the\r\noriginal extent of this great volcanic area as not less than between\r\n2000 and 3000 square miles.\r\n\r\nIt is in this tract that the phenomena of the plateaux are most\r\nadmirably displayed. Ranges of lofty escarpments reveal the succession\r\nof the several eruptions, and the lower ground in front of these\r\nescarpments presents to us, as the result of stupendous denudation,\r\nmany of the vents from which the materials of the plateau were ejected,\r\nwhile in the western portion of the area admirable coast-sections lay\r\nbare to view the minutest details of structure.[414]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: This plateau is represented in Sheets 12, 21, 29, 30, 31\r\nand 39 of the Geological Survey, and is described in the accompanying\r\nMemoirs as far as published. The eastern part of the Campsie Hills was\r\nsurveyed by Mr. B. N. Peach, the western part by Mr. R. L. Jack, who\r\nalso mapped the rest of the plateau to the Clyde, and a portion of\r\nthe high ground of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire; the rest of the area,\r\nsouth to Ardrossan, was surveyed by myself. The tract from Stewarton\r\nto Strathavon was surveyed by Mr. James Geikie, the Cumbraes and Bute\r\nby Mr. W. Gunn, and southern Cantyre by Mr. R. G. Symes. The Campsie\r\nHills have been partly described by Mr. John Young in the first volume\r\nof the _Transactions of the Glasgow Geological Society_. The occurrence\r\nof plants in the tuffs of the east coast of Arran was discovered by Mr.\r\nE. Wunsch. The Campbeltown igneous rocks were described by J. Nicol,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ viii. (1852), p. 406. See also J. Bryce's\r\n_Arran and Clydesdale_.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the map (No. IV.), that the Clyde plateau extends\r\nin a general north-east and south-west direction. It is inclined on\r\nthe whole towards the east, where, when not interrupted by faults, its\r\nhighest lavas and tuffs may be seen to pass under the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series. Its greatest elevations are thus towards its\r\nescarpment, which, commencing above the plains of the Forth a little\r\nto the west of Stirling, extends as a striking feature to the Clyde\r\nabove Dumbarton. On the south side of the great estuary the escarpment\r\nagain stretches in a noble range of terraced slopes for many miles\r\ninto Ayrshire. It is well developed in the Little Cumbrae Island (Fig.\r\n107), and in the south of Bute, where its successive platforms of lava\r\nmount in terraces and green slopes above the Firth. Even as far as the\r\nsouthern coast of Cantyre the characteristic plateau scenery reappears\r\nin the outliers which there cap the hills and descend the slopes (Fig.\r\n108).\r\n\r\nWhile the escarpment side of this plateau is comparatively unfaulted,\r\nso that the order of succession of the lavas and their superposition\r\nin the sedimentary rocks can be distinctly seen, the eastern or dip\r\nside is almost everywhere dislocated. Innumerable local ruptures have\r\ntaken place, allowing the limestone series to subside, and giving to\r\nthe margin of the volcanic area a remarkably notched appearance. To the\r\neffects of this faulting may be attributed the way in which the plateau\r\nhas been separated into detached blocks with intervening younger\r\nstrata. Thus a complex series of dislocations brings in a long strip\r\nof Carboniferous Limestone which extends from Johnston to Ardrossan,\r\nwhile another series lets in the limestone that runs from Barrhead to\r\nnear Dalry. In each of these instances, the continuity of the volcanic\r\nplateau is interrupted. To the same cause we owe the occasional\r\nreappearance of a portion of the plateau beyond the limits of the main\r\nmass, as for instance in the detached area which occurs in the valley\r\nof the Garnock above Kilwinning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--View of the edge of the Volcanic Plateau\r\nsouth of Campbeltown, Argyllshire.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost of the three zones is the volcanic series with its\r\nlava-ridges. The central band is the Upper Old Red Sandstone, lying\r\nconformably beneath the lavas, with its cornstone which has been\r\nquarried. The lowest band, tinted dark, is the Lower Old Red Sandstone,\r\non which the other rocks rest unconformably.]\r\n\r\nDenudation has likewise come into play, not only in reducing the area\r\nof the plateau, but in isolating portions of it into outliers, with or\r\nwithout the assistance of faults. The site of the Cumbraes and Bute\r\nwas no doubt at one time covered with a continuous sheet of volcanic\r\nmaterial, and there appears to be no reason for refusing to believe\r\nthat this sheet formed part of that which caps the opposite uplands of\r\nAyrshire. From the southern end of Bute it is only about seven miles\r\nacross to the shore of Arran near Corrie, where the lavas and tuffs\r\nreappear. They are so poorly represented there, however, that we are\r\nevidently not far from the limit of the plateau in that direction. So\r\nvast has been the denudation of the region that it is now impossible to\r\ndetermine whether the volcanic ejections of Campbeltown, which occupy\r\nthe same geological platform as those of Arran, Bute and Ayrshire, were\r\nalso actually continuous with them. But as the distance between the\r\ndenuded fragments of the volcanic series in Arran and in Cantyre is\r\nonly about 20 miles it is not improbable that this continuity existed,\r\nand thus that the volcanic accumulations reached at least as far as the\r\nsouthern end of Argyllshire, where they now slip under the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--View of North Berwick Law from the east, a\r\ntrachyte neck marking one of the chief vents of the Garleton Plateau.\r\n(From a photograph.)\r\n\r\nThis illustration and Figs. 119, 133 and 135 are from photographs taken\r\nby Mr. Robert Lunn for the Geological Survey.]\r\n\r\n2. The East Lothian or Garleton Plateau.--Some 50 miles to the east\r\nof the Clyde volcanic district, and entirely independent of it, lies\r\nthe plateau of the Garleton Hills in East Lothian, which, as its\r\nlimits towards the east and north have been reduced by denudation, and\r\ntowards the west are hidden under the Carboniferous Limestone series\r\nof Haddington, covers now an area of not more than about 60 square\r\nmiles.[415] That the eruptions from this area did not extend far to\r\nthe north is shown by the absence of all trace of them among the Lower\r\nCarboniferous rocks of Fife. A relic of them occurs above Borthwick,\r\nin Midlothian, about twelve miles to the south-west of the nearest\r\nmargin of the plateau. The area over which the lavas and tuffs were\r\ndischarged may not have exceeded 150 square miles. Small though this\r\nplateau is, it possesses much interest from the remarkable variety of\r\npetrographical character in its lavas, from the size and composition of\r\nits necks, and from the picturesque coast-line where its details have\r\nbeen admirably dissected by the waves. In many respects it stands by\r\nitself as an exception to the general type of the other plateaux.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: This plateau is represented in Sheets 33 and 41 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Scotland, and is described in the Explanation to\r\naccompany Sheet 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--The Bass Rock, a trachytic neck belonging to\r\nthe Garleton plateau, from the shore at Canty Bay.]\r\n\r\nFrom its proximity to Edinburgh this volcanic area has been often\r\nstudied and described. The memoirs of Hay Cunningham and Maclaren\r\ngave the fullest account of it until its structure was mapped by\r\nthe Geological Survey. Its scenery differs from that of the other\r\nplateaux chiefly in the absence of the terraced contour which in them\r\nis so characteristic. The peculiar lavas of the Garleton Hills form\r\nirregularly-uneven ground, rising to not more than 600 feet above the\r\nsea. They slope gradually down to the coast, where a succession of\r\nfine sections of the volcanic series has been laid bare for a distance\r\nof altogether about ten miles. Nowhere, indeed, can the phenomena of\r\nthe plateau-tuffs and their association with the Carboniferous strata\r\nbe so well studied as along the coast-line from North Berwick to\r\nDunbar. Among the necks of this plateau distinguished for their size,\r\nconspicuous prominence and component materials, the most important are\r\nthose that form the conical eminences of North Berwick Law (Fig. 109),\r\nTraprain Law (Fig. 133), and the Bass Rock (Fig. 110).\r\n\r\n3. The Midlothian Plateau.--On the same general stratigraphical horizon\r\nas the other volcanic plateaux, a narrow band of lavas and tuffs can\r\nbe followed from the eastern outskirts of the city of Edinburgh into\r\nLanarkshire, a distance of about 23 miles. It is not continuously\r\nvisible, often disappearing altogether, and varying much in thickness\r\nand composition. This volcanic tract, which may be conveniently termed\r\nthe Midlothian Plateau, is the smallest and most fragmentary of all the\r\nseries. Its most easterly outliers form Arthur Seat and Calton Hill at\r\nEdinburgh.[416] Three miles to the south-west a third detached portion\r\nis known as Craiglockhart Hill. After another interval of ten miles,\r\nthe largest remaining fragment forms the prominent ridge of Corston\r\nHill (Fig. 111), whence a discontinuous narrow strip may be traced\r\nnearly as far as the River Clyde.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: I formerly classed these eminences with the Puys, but I\r\nam now of opinion that they ought rather to be regarded as fragments\r\nof a long and somewhat narrow plateau. Their basic lavas and overlying\r\nsheets of porphyrite repeat the usual sequence of the plateaux, which\r\nis not met with among the Puys. But, as will be pointed out in the\r\nsequel, Arthur Seat in long subsequent time became again the site of a\r\nvolcanic vent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Corston Hill--a fragment of the Midlothian\r\nPlateau, seen from the north.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rocks form a cake on the top, the slopes lying across the\r\nedges of the Calciferous Sandstones.]\r\n\r\nThe well-known Arthur Seat and Calton Hill have been fully described\r\nby Maclaren, and have been the subject of numerous observations by\r\nother geologists.[417] They have been likewise mapped in detail on a\r\nlarge scale by the Geological Survey, and have been described in the\r\nSurvey Memoirs. The rest of the plateau to the south-west is much less\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: Maclaren's _Geology of Fife and the Lothians_, 1839, pp.\r\n1-67; and Hay Cunningham, _Mem. Wer. Soc._ vii. pp. 51-62. The plateau\r\nis represented in Sheets 24 and 32 of the Geological Survey, and Arthur\r\nSeat and Calton Hill will be found on Sheet 2 of the Geological Survey\r\nmap of Edinburghshire on the scale of 6 inches to a mile.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 112 the great escarpment which descends from the right\r\ntowards the centre is the sill of Salisbury Crags. The long dark\r\ncrag (Long Row) rising between the two valleys is the lowest of the\r\ninterstratified lavas. The slope that rises above it has been cut\r\nout of well-bedded tuffs, on which lie the basalts and andesites in\r\nsuccessive sheets that form all the eastern or left side of the hill.\r\nThe rocks around the summit belong to a much later period of volcanic\r\neruption, and are referred to in Chapter xxxi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--View of Arthur Seat from Calton Hill to the\r\nnorth.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this plateau are comparatively limited in thickness,\r\nand have a much more restricted vertical range than those of other\r\ndistricts. At Arthur Seat and Corston Hill they begin above the\r\ncement-stones and cease in a low part of the great group of white\r\nsandstones and dark shales which form the upper half of the Calciferous\r\nSandstones of Midlothian. They do not ascend as high as the Burdiehouse\r\nLimestone, which to the west of Corston Hill is seen to come on above\r\nthem. One of their most remarkable features is the manner in which\r\nthey diminish to a single thin bed and then die out altogether,\r\nreappearing again in a similar attenuated form on the same horizon.\r\nThis impersistence is well seen in the south-western part of the area,\r\nbetween Buteland, in the parish of Currie, and Crosswood, in the\r\nparish of Mid-Calder. The lowest more basic band may there be traced\r\nat intervals for many miles without the overlying andesitic group. Yet\r\nthat andesites followed the basalts, as in other plateaux, is well\r\nshown by large remnants of these less basic lavas left in Arthur Seat\r\nand Calton Hill. On the extreme southern margin of the area also a thin\r\nband of porphyrite with a group of overlying tuffs is seen above the\r\nred sandstones near Dunsyre.[418] The eruptions over the site of this\r\nplateau seem to have been much more local and limited than in the other\r\nplateaux. They appear to have gathered chiefly around two centres of\r\nactivity, one of which lay about the position of Edinburgh, the other\r\nin the neighbourhood of Corston Hill. It is worthy of remark that this\r\ntract of volcanic material flanks the much older range of lavas and\r\ntuffs of the Pentland Hills and wraps round the south-western end\r\nof this range, thus furnishing another illustration of the renewal\r\nof volcanic activity in the same region during successive geological\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: _Explanation, Geol. Surv. Scotland_, Sheet 24, p. 13\r\n(1869).]\r\n\r\n4. The Berwickshire Plateau.--Another and entirely disconnected area\r\noccurs in the broad plain or Merse of the lower portion of the valley\r\nof the Tweed.[419] The northern limit of its volcanic tuff occurs in\r\nthe River Whitadder above Duns, whence the erupted materials rapidly\r\nwiden and thicken towards the south-west by Stitchell and Kelso, until\r\nthey die out against the flanks of the Cheviot Hills. The eastern\r\nextension of the area is lost beneath the Cement-stone group which\r\ncovers the Merse down to the sea. Its western boundary must once have\r\nreached far beyond its present limits, for the low Silurian ground in\r\nthat direction is dotted over with scattered vents to a distance of ten\r\nmiles or more from the present outcrop of the bedded lavas, extensive\r\ndenudation having cleared away the erupted materials and exposed the\r\nvolcanic pipes over many square miles of country. Among the more\r\nprominent of these old vents are the Eildon Hills, Minto Crags and\r\nRubers Law, as well as many other eminences familiar in Border story.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: This plateau is shown on Sheets 17, 25, 26 and 33 of the\r\nGeological Survey Map of Scotland. It was chiefly mapped by Prof. James\r\nGeikie and Mr. B. N. Peach.]\r\n\r\nThe bedded volcanic rocks of this area form a marked feature in the\r\ntopography and geology of the district. They rise above the plain of\r\nthe Merse as a band of undulating hills, of which the eminence crowned\r\nby Hume Castle, about 600 feet above the sea, is the most conspicuous\r\nheight. In the geological structure of this part of Scotland they are\r\nmainly interposed between the Upper Old Red Sandstone and the base of\r\nthe Carboniferous system, which they thus serve to divide from each\r\nother. But their lowest sheets appear to be in some places intercalated\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone, so that their eruption probably began before\r\nthe beginning of the Carboniferous period. They form a band that curves\r\nround the end of the great Carboniferous trough at Kelso and skirts the\r\nnorthern edge of the andesites of the Lower Old Red Sandstone in the\r\nCheviot Hills.\r\n\r\n5. The Solway Plateau.--The last plateau, that of the Solway basin,\r\nthough its present visible eastern limits approach those reached by\r\nthe lavas from the Berwickshire area, was quite distinct, and had\r\nits chief vents at some distance towards the south-west.[420] On\r\nthe north-western flanks of the Cheviot Hills, the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone is overlain by the lowest Carboniferous strata, without the\r\nintercalation of any volcanic zone, so that there must have been some\r\nintermediate ground that escaped being flooded with lava from the\r\nvents of the Merse on the one hand, and of the Solway on the other.\r\nThe Solway lavas form a much thinner group than those of Berwickshire.\r\nFrom the wild moorland between the sources of the Liddell and the Rule\r\nWater, they run in a narrow and much-faulted band south-westward across\r\nEskdale and the foot of Annandale, and are traceable in occasional\r\npatches on the farther side of the Nith along the southern flanks of\r\nCriffel, even as far as Torrorie on the coast of Kirkcudbright--a total\r\ndistance of about 45 miles. It is probable that this long outcrop\r\npresents merely the northern edge of a volcanic platform which is\r\nmainly buried under the Carboniferous rocks of the Solway basin. Yet it\r\nexhibits many of the chief characters of the other plateaux, and even\r\noccasionally rivals them in the dignity of the escarpments which mark\r\nits progress through the lonely uplands between the head of Liddesdale\r\nand the Ewes Water (Figs. 113, 142).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: For a delineation of the distribution and structure of\r\nthis plateau see Sheets 5, 6, 10, 11 and 17 of the Geological Survey of\r\nScotland. In the upper part of Liddesdale, Ewesdale and Tarras it was\r\nmapped by Mr. B. N. Peach; in lower Liddesdale and Eskdale by Mr. R. L.\r\nJack and Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson; from Langholm to the Annan by Mr. H.\r\nSkae; and in Kirkcudbright by Mr. John Horne.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--View of Arkleton Fell, part of the Solway\r\nPlateau, from the south-west.\r\n\r\n  The lower slopes below the single bird, round to the left side of\r\n     the sketch, are on the Upper Old Red Sandstone; the line of crag\r\n     below the two birds marks the volcanic group above which lies an\r\n     outlier of the Calciferous Sandstone series, forming the upper\r\n     part of the hill (three birds). The knobs under the four birds\r\n     are bosses of andesite.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe plateaux of the Merse and the Solway illustrate in a striking\r\nmanner the distribution of the volcanic eruptions along valleys and low\r\nplains. The vents from which the lavas and tuffs proceeded are chiefly\r\nto be found on the lower grounds, though these bedded volcanic rocks\r\nrise to a height of 1712 feet (the Pikes) to the west of the Cheviot\r\nHills. Between the Silurian uplands of Selkirkshire and Berwickshire on\r\nthe north and the ridge of the Cheviot Hills on the south, the broad\r\nplain was dotted with volcanic vents and flooded with lava, while to\r\nthe south-west the corresponding hollow between the uplands of Dumfries\r\nand Galloway on the one side, and those of Cumberland on the other,\r\nwas similarly overspread. The significance of these facts will be more\r\napparent when the grouping of the vents has been described. We shall\r\nthen also be better able to realize the validity of the inference that\r\nthe present plateaux are mere fragments of what they originally were,\r\nwide areas having been removed from the one side of them by denudation,\r\nand having been concealed on the other under later portions of the\r\nCarboniferous system.\r\n\r\nThe same two plateaux likewise supply further illustrations of the\r\noutflow of similar volcanic materials in the same locality at widely\r\nseparated intervals of time. They may be traced up to and round the\r\nmargin of the great pile of andesites of Lower Old Red Sandstone age\r\nforming the Cheviot Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. NATURE OF THE MATERIALS ERUPTED\r\n\r\nThe volcanic materials characteristic of the plateau-type of eruptions\r\nconsist mainly of lavas in successive sheets, but include also various\r\ntuffs in frequent thin courses, and less commonly in thick local\r\naccumulations. The lavas are chiefly andesites in the altered condition\r\nof porphyrites. They vary a good deal in the relative proportions of\r\nsilica. Some of them are decidedly basic and take the form of dolerites\r\nand olivine-basalts. With these rocks are occasionally associated\r\n\"ultra-basic\" varieties, where the felspar almost disappears and the\r\nmaterial consists mainly of ferro-magnesian minerals. The more basic\r\nrocks are generally found towards the bottom of the volcanic series,\r\nwhere they appear as the oldest flows. In the Garleton Hills lavas of\r\na much more acid nature are met with--true sanidine-trachytes, which\r\noverlie the porphyrites and basalts of the earlier eruptions.\r\n\r\nNo adequate investigation has yet been made of the chemical and\r\nmicroscopic characters of these various rocks, regarded as a great\r\nvolcanic series belonging to a definite geological age, though many of\r\nthe individual rocks and the petrography of different districts have\r\nbeen more or less fully described. I cannot here enter into much detail\r\non the subject, but must content myself with such a summary as will\r\nconvey some idea of the general composition and structure of this very\r\ninteresting volcanic series.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Augite-olivine Rocks (Picrites and Limburgites).--Towards the\r\nbottom of the plateaux there are found here and there sheets of\r\n\"ultra-basic\" material, some of which appear to be bedded with the\r\nother rocks and to have flowed out as surface-lavas, though it may be\r\nimpossible to prove that they are not sills. Thus at Whitelaw Hill, on\r\nthe south side of the Garleton Hills, a dark heavy rock is found to\r\ncontain hardly any felspar, but to be made up mainly of olivine and\r\naugite. Dr. Hatch has published a description and drawing of this rock,\r\ntogether with the following analysis by Mr. Player:[421]--\r\n\r\n  Silica              40·2\r\n  Titanic oxide        2·9\r\n  Alumina             12·8\r\n  Ferric oxide         4·0\r\n  Ferrous oxide       10·4\r\n  Lime                10·4\r\n  Magnesia            11·9\r\n  Potash               0·8\r\n  Soda                 2·7\r\n  Loss by ignition     3·4\r\n                      ----\r\n  Spec. grav. 3·03.   99·5\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxvii. (1893), p. 116.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Dolerites and Basalts.[422]--These rocks are found both as\r\ninterstratified lavas and as intrusive masses. In the former condition\r\nthey take a conspicuous place among the sheets of the plateaux,\r\nbut especially in the lower parts of the series. They are dark,\r\noften black, usually more or less porphyritic, with large felspars,\r\nfrequently also large crystals of augite or olivine, and may be\r\ndescribed as porphyritic olivine-dolerites and olivine-basalts, more\r\nrarely as olivine-free dolerites and basalts. Their groundmass consists\r\nof short laths or microlites of felspar (probably labradorite) and\r\ngranules or small crystals of augite and magnetite, with sometimes a\r\nlittle fibrous brown mica. The large porphyritic felspars are striped\r\n(probably labradorite), the augites are frequently chloritized, and the\r\nolivines are generally more or less serpentinized. But in some cases\r\nall these minerals are as fresh as in a recent basalt. The rocks are\r\nsometimes beautifully columnar, as at Arthur Seat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: A general classification of the whole series of Scottish\r\nCarboniferous dolerites and basalts, including both the plateau and\r\npuy examples, will be given in the account of the rocks of the puys in\r\nChapter XXVI. (p. 418).]\r\n\r\nOf these basic lavas conspicuous examples may be seen at Arthur Seat,\r\nCalton Hill and Craiglockhart Hill. The eastern part of Arthur Seat,\r\nknown as Whinny Hill, furnishes examples of olivine-dolerites of the\r\nJedburgh type (p. 418). The beautiful basalt of Craiglockhart with its\r\nlarge porphyritic olivines and augites has afforded a distinct type\r\nof Carboniferous basalt (p. 418). The same type occurs on the Calton\r\nHill in the cliff below the gaol. Similar basic lavas are especially\r\nabundant and remarkable in the Clyde plateau near Campbeltown in\r\nArgyllshire, and at the south end of Bute and in the Cumbraes, where\r\nthey are associated with an interesting series of dykes and sills.\r\nBut even where, as in the Garleton Hills, the lavas are for the most\r\npart somewhat acid in composition, those first poured out, which form\r\nthe lowest band, include some typical olivine-basalts, of which a\r\ncharacteristic example occurs at Kippie Law at the base of the Garleton\r\nplateau (p. 418). It has been described by Dr. Hatch as exhibiting\r\nunder the microscope porphyritic crystals of felspar and olivine lying\r\nin a groundmass composed of lath-shaped felspars, granular olivine and\r\nmagnetite, and microlitic augite. The olivine, originally the most\r\nabundant constituent, has been converted into a fibrous aggregate\r\nof serpentine. All the minerals are more or less idiomorphic, but\r\nespecially the augite, which crowds the groundmass in delicately-shaped\r\nprisms, most of which are terminated at both ends by faces of the\r\nhemi-pyramid. The analysis of this rock is given in the accompanying\r\ntable of analyses of Garleton basalts. The Kippie Law type of basalt\r\nwas recognized by Dr. Hatch among the Geological Survey collections\r\nfrom other districts, as in the intrusive bosses of Neides Law and\r\nBonchester near Jedburgh, and from the Campsie plateau a mile and a\r\nhalf north of Lennoxtown.[423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxvii. (1893), pp.\r\n117-119.]\r\n\r\nAt Hailes Castle, in the Garleton plateau, the lower basic lavas\r\ninclude another olivine-basalt somewhat more felspathic than that just\r\ndescribed, and at Markle quarry the rock is still more felspathic and\r\ncontains the olivine only in small sporadic grains. The composition of\r\nthese basic rocks of the Garleton plateau is shown in the subjoined\r\ntable of analyses by Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson:--\r\n\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |            | Kippie Law,  | Hailes Castle, | Markle Quarry, |\r\n  |            |  specific    |    specific    |    specific    |\r\n  |            | gravity 2·8  |  gravity 2·76  |  gravity 2·7   |\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |SiO_{2}     |     46·01    |      49·07     |      49·54     |\r\n  |Al_{2}O_{3} |     19·19    |      19·43     |      22·23     |\r\n  |Fe_{2}O_{3} |      5·91    |      10·58     |       9·55     |\r\n  |FeO         |      6·75    |       2·35     |       1·12     |\r\n  |MnO         |      0·19    |       0·32     |       0·08     |\r\n  |CaO         |      8·68    |       7·87     |       7·19     |\r\n  |MgO         |      6·81    |       4·36     |       2·80     |\r\n  |K_{2}O      |      1·20    |       0·98     |       1·81     |\r\n  |Na_{2}O     |      3·27    |       3·31     |       4·56     |\r\n  |H_{2}O      |      3·07    |       2·26     |       2·42     |\r\n  |Total       |    101·08    |     100·53     |     101·30     |\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nOlivine-dolerites are more especially developed in the district around\r\nJedburgh, where they form some of the most prominent bosses, such\r\nas Dunian and Black Law. They show a sub-ophitic groundmass, with\r\ninconspicuous porphyritic crystals, among which those of olivine are\r\nmore prominent than the felspars (p. 418).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Andesites (Porphyrites).--These are the most abundant lavas\r\nof the plateaux. They occur in every district, and usually form the\r\nmain constituents of the pile of volcanic material. They vary in\r\ncolour from a pale pinkish grey, through many shades of red, purple,\r\nbrown and yellow, to sometimes a dark green or nearly black rock.\r\nTheir texture ranges from almost semi-vitreous, through different\r\ndegrees of compactness, to open, cellular, slaggy masses. Generally\r\nthrough their base porphyritic felspars are abundantly disseminated,\r\nsometimes in large, flat, tabular forms, like those of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone already referred to. The amygdaloidal kernels consist of\r\ncalcite, zeolites, chalcedony or quartz. It is from the amygdaloids on\r\neither side of the Clyde that the fine examples of zeolites have been\r\nchiefly obtained for which the south of Scotland has long been famed.\r\nOccasionally, as at the south end of Bute, the andesitic lavas display\r\na marked columnar structure.\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope these rocks present the usual fine felted\r\naggregate of felspar microlites, with granules or crystals of magnetite\r\nand sometimes pyroxene. The porphyritic felspars, often large and well\r\ndefined, generally contain inclusions of the groundmass. Occasionally\r\nsome of the large porphyritic constituents are augite, or pseudomorphs\r\nafter that mineral. The alteration of the rocks has oxidized some of\r\nthe iron-ore and given rise to the prevalent purplish and reddish tints.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Trachytes.--Some of the most remarkable lavas to be found in\r\nany of the plateaux are those which constitute a large part of the\r\nGarleton Hills. They overlie the lower andesite and basalt platform,\r\nwhich surrounds them as a narrow belt, while they occupy the central\r\nand much the largest part of the area. They have been included among\r\nthe porphyrites, but are pale rocks, generally with a yellowish crust,\r\npresenting when quite fresh a grey, compact, felsitic base with large\r\nporphyritic crystals of unstriped felspar.\r\n\r\nA number of specimens selected as illustrative of the different\r\nvarieties have been analyzed and the results are stated in the\r\nsubjoined table.[424] The specific gravity of the rocks is about 2·6.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: The first two analyses are by Mr. J.

Small but well-formed\r\ncrystals of yellowish-green augite, in addition to the porphyritic\r\nfelspars, are imbedded in a fine groundmass composed chiefly of\r\nmicrolites of sanidine, but with granules of augite and magnetite\r\nplentifully interspersed, and occasionally prisms of apatite. There\r\nis a group in which the porphyritic felspars are scarce or absent.\r\nIn these there is little or no ferro-magnesian constituent. Other\r\ntrachytes, rather less basic than the augite-bearing varieties here\r\nreferred to, occur as bosses in the Garleton Hills district, and are\r\nreferred to in the following section (_e_).[425]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: For fuller petrographical details consult Dr. Hatch's\r\npaper above cited.]\r\n\r\n(_e_) Rocks of the Necks.--In the necks connected with the plateaux\r\nother types of massive rock are to be found. Among these perhaps the\r\nmost frequent are trachytes, grey to pink in colour, but apt to weather\r\nyellow, exceedingly compact, sparingly porphyritic, and with a peculiar\r\nplaty structure and waxy lustre. Rocks of this character also appear as\r\nsills and dykes. Other varieties that occur in similar positions are\r\nmore basic in composition, including dark, coarse, granular diabases.\r\nIn the Jedburgh district the most frequent rocks are beautiful\r\nvarieties of olivine-dolerite and olivine-basalt, which form most of\r\nthe prominent hills of the neighbourhood. These bosses are sometimes\r\nassociated with agglomerates as at Rubers Law.\r\n\r\nIn the Garleton Hills district, some of the necks present another\r\npetrographical type which directly connects them with the remarkable\r\nlavas of the higher part of that plateau. Thus the rock of Traprain Law\r\nwas ascertained by Dr. Hatch to be a true phonolite. In its general\r\nplaty structure and sonorous ring under the hammer it reminds one of\r\ntypical phonolites. Under the microscope the rock is found to consist\r\nmainly of small lath-shaped crystals of sanidine arranged in a marked\r\nminute flow-structure, but with few porphyritic crystals. It contains\r\nsmall crystals and ophitic patches of a light green soda-augite,\r\nwith practically no magnesia in it. A small quantity of iron-ore and\r\nisolated granules of apatite are also present, together with patches of\r\nnepheline which, though generally decomposed and replaced with zeolitic\r\nproducts, occasionally display six- and four-sided crystal-contours. An\r\nanalysis of the Traprain phonolite by Mr. Player is subjoined:--[426]\r\n\r\n  Silica              56·8\r\n  Titanic acid         0·5\r\n  Alumina             19·7\r\n  Ferric oxide         2·2\r\n  Ferrous oxide        3·5\r\n  Manganous oxide      0·2\r\n  Lime                 2·2\r\n  Magnesia             0·4\r\n  Soda                 4·3\r\n  Potash               7·1\r\n  Loss by ignition     2·5\r\n                      ----\r\n  Spec. grav. 2·588   99·4\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: _Trans.

The Bass Rock, though its geological relations are\r\nconcealed by the sea, is in all probability another neck of this\r\ndistrict. It is likewise a mass of trachyte, composed almost entirely\r\nof lath-shaped crystals of sanidine, with no ferro-magnesian\r\nconstituent, but a good deal of iron ore. It shows none of the large\r\nporphyritic felspars so characteristic of the Garleton Hills lavas, but\r\nit closely resembles the non-porphyritic varieties, particularly the\r\nlavas of Score Hill, Pencraig, Lock Pit Hill, and Craigie Hill.[427]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: The composition of the rocks of North Berwick Law and\r\nthe Bass closely resembles that of the trachytic lavas of the plateau.\r\nFor analyses, see Dr. Hatch's Paper, _ibid._ pp. 123, 124.]\r\n\r\n(_f_) Tuffs.--The fragmentary ejections of the plateaux vary in texture\r\nfrom the finest-grained tuffs to coarse agglomerates.[428] As they have\r\nbeen derived from the explosion of andesite-lavas, they consist mainly\r\nof the debris of these rocks. They are often deep red in colour, as for\r\nexample those of Dunbar, but are most frequently greenish. They have\r\na granular texture, due to the small lapilli of various porphyrites\r\nimbedded in a fine dust of the same material. Grains of quartz,\r\nfrequently to be detected even in the finer tuffs, may either have\r\nbeen ejected from the volcanic vents, or may have been grains of sand\r\nin the ordinary sediment of the sea-bottom. Both at the base and at\r\nthe top of the plateau-series, the tuffs are interstratified with and\r\nblend into sandstones and shales, so that specimens may be collected\r\nshowing a gradual passage from volcanic into non-volcanic detritus.\r\nIn many of the tuffs of the necks fragments of sandstone and other\r\nstratified rocks occur, representing the strata through which the vents\r\nwere drilled. In the tuffs of the Eaglesham district pieces of grey\r\nand pink granite have been met with which, if they are portions of an\r\nold granite mass below, must have come from a great depth.[429] In the\r\ncoarser tuffs and agglomerates a larger variety of lava-form rocks is\r\nto be found than can be seen among the bedded lavas of the Plateaux.\r\nThey include felsites and quartz-porphyries, and more rarely basic\r\nlavas (diabases, etc.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: For accounts of these rocks, see Explanation of Sheet 33\r\n_Geol.

Bedded Lavas and Tuffs; Upper Limits and Original Areas and\r\n     Slopes of the Plateaux; 2. Vents; Necks of Agglomerate and Tuff;\r\n     Necks of Massive Rock; Composite Necks; 3. Dykes and Sills; 4.\r\n     Close of the Plateau-eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure of the various plateaux presents a general similarity,\r\nwith many local variations. Each plateau is built up entirely, or\r\nalmost entirely, of sheets of volcanic material, the intercalations\r\nof ordinary sedimentary layers being, for the most part, few and\r\nunimportant, and usually occurring either towards the base or the top\r\nof the volcanic series, though at a few localities interstratifications\r\nof shale and sandstone, marking pauses in the eruptions, occur\r\nthroughout that series. The vents of eruption are in some instances\r\nstill to be recognized on the plateaux themselves. More usually they\r\noccur on the lower ground flanking the volcanic escarpments, where they\r\nhave been laid bare by denudation. Dykes, though seldom abundant, are\r\nassociated with the plateaux, while the sills which may mark the latest\r\nmanifestations of volcanic energy, though not developed on so large a\r\nscale as among the Cambrian and Silurian volcanoes, can nevertheless be\r\ndistinctly recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of some interest to determine the geological date\r\nof the commencement of the plateau-eruptions by fixing the precise\r\nstratigraphical horizon on which the base of the volcanic series rests.\r\nI have already referred to the fact that this base does not always\r\nlie on the same platform among the Lower Carboniferous formations. In\r\nBerwickshire, as above mentioned, the earliest eruptions appear to have\r\ntaken place before the close of the Upper Old Red Sandstone period.\r\nThese are the earliest of the whole series. In Cantyre, the lowest\r\nlavas and tuffs come directly upon the sandstones, marls and cornstones\r\nof the Upper Old Red Sandstone. In Stirlingshire, Renfrewshire and\r\nAyrshire several hundred feet of the Cement-stone group are sometimes\r\ninterposed between the bottom of the volcanic rocks and the top of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone. This divergence doubtless indicates that the\r\neruptions began earlier in some districts than in others. But there\r\nwere also probably unequal terrestrial movements preceding, and\r\nperhaps accompanying, the volcanic outbursts. In the case of the Clyde\r\nplateau, for example, if we examine its base in the neighbourhood of\r\nFintry, we find that it lies upon some 500 feet of Carboniferous white\r\nsandstone, red and green marls and cement-stones, which rest on the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone. Yet only eight miles to the eastward, this\r\nconsiderable mass of strata disappears, and the bottom of the lavas\r\ncomes down upon the red sandstones. Five miles still further in the\r\nsame direction the volcanic masses likewise die out, and then the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series is found at Abbey Craig to lie, with\r\nscarcely any representative of the Cement-stone group, on the Upper\r\nOld Red Sandstone (Fig. 114). Again, to the south-west of Fintry, the\r\nzone of cement-stones below the volcanic series continues to vary\r\nconsiderably in thickness and sometimes almost to disappear, while in\r\nAyrshire the lavas lie immediately on the red sandstones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Vertical sections of the escarpment of the\r\nClyde plateau from north-east to south-west.\r\n\r\n  I.

The dotted lines connect the base of the volcanic series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese irregularities, not improbably indicative of inequalities\r\nof subsidence and of deposition, may have been connected with the\r\nsubterranean disturbances which culminated in the abundant outbreak\r\nof volcanic action. But though the volcanic rocks of the plateaux may\r\nbe traced overlapping the underlying strata, no evidence has anywhere\r\nbeen detected of an unconformability between them and the Lower\r\nCarboniferous or Upper Old Red Sandstone series.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BEDDED LAVAS AND TUFFS\r\n\r\nThe successive sheets of lava in a plateau usually form thin and\r\nwidespread beds which are only occasionally separated by intercalations\r\nof tuff or of red marl. In this, as well as in other respects, they\r\npresent much resemblance to the lavas of the Tertiary plateaux of\r\nAntrim and the Inner Hebrides. They are generally marked off from each\r\nother by the slaggy upper and under portions of the successive flows,\r\nand this structure gives a distinctly bedded aspect to the escarpments,\r\nas in the Campsie and Largs Hills, or still more conspicuously in\r\nLittle Cumbrae (Fig. 107) and the southern end of Bute. Considerable\r\ndiversity of structure may be noticed among these sheets. Some\r\npresent a compact jointed centre passing up and down into the slaggy\r\nmaterial just referred to; others have assumed a vesicular character\r\nthroughout, the vesicles being often elongated in the direction of\r\nflow. Where, as usually occurs, the vesicular is replaced by the\r\namygdaloidal structure, some of the rocks have long been famous for\r\nthe minerals found in their cavities. The beautiful zeolites of the\r\nKilpatrick and Renfrewshire Hills, for example, may be found in every\r\nlarge mineralogical collection in the country. Well-developed columnar\r\nstructure occasionally appears among the lavas of the plateaux, but\r\nchiefly, so far as I have observed, in the lower or more basic group,\r\nas in the basalts along the east side of the Dry Dam at Arthur Seat.\r\n\r\nIn each plateau the lavas may be observed to thicken in one direction,\r\nor more usually towards more than one, and this increase no doubt\r\nindicates in which quarters the chief centres of discharge lay. Thus\r\nin the Clyde plateau, several areas of maximum development may be\r\ndetected. In the Kilpatrick Hills the total thickness of lavas and\r\ntuffs exceeds 3000 feet (Fig. 120). Above Largs it is more than 1500\r\nfeet, rapidly thinning away towards the south. The continuation of the\r\nplateau far to the north-east in the Campsie Fells reveals a thickness\r\nof about 1000 feet of lavas at Kilsyth, which become thicker further\r\nwest, but eastward rapidly diminish in collective bulk, until in about\r\ntwelve or thirteen miles they disappear altogether, and then, as\r\nalready remarked, the Calciferous Sandstone series closes up without\r\nany volcanic intercalation.\r\n\r\nIn the Solway plateau, the lavas attain a maximum development about\r\nBirrenswark, whence they diminish in bulk towards the north-east and\r\nsouth-west. The Berwickshire plateau reaches its thickest mass about\r\nStitchill, whence it rapidly thins away towards the north-east, until\r\nat a distance of some twelve miles it disappears altogether, the last\r\ntrace of it in that direction being a band of tuff which dies out in\r\nthe Calciferous Sandstones to the north of Duns.\r\n\r\nIn the Midlothian Plateau, the development of the volcanic series is\r\nmore irregular than in any of the others. As already remarked, there\r\nappear to have been at least two chief centres of discharge in this\r\nregion, one at Edinburgh and one some fourteen miles to the south-west.\r\nAt the former, the volcanic materials attain in Arthur Seat and Calton\r\nHill a thickness of about 1100 feet. In Craiglockhart Hill, three miles\r\ndistant, they are still about 600 feet thick. But beyond that eminence\r\nthey cease to be traceable for about eight miles, either because they\r\nentirely die out, or because their dwindling outcrops are concealed\r\nunder superficial deposits. As we approach the south-western centre\r\nof eruption around Corston Hill a new volcanic group begins and soon\r\nincreases in bulk.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature of the plateaux is found in the difference\r\nbetween the lavas that were first erupted and those which followed\r\nthem. The earlier eruptions, as above remarked, were generally basic,\r\nsometimes highly so. Thus at Arthur Seat the thick series of lavas\r\nwhich form the eastern part of the hill have at their base several\r\nsheets of columnar basalt, over which come the andesites that make up\r\nthe main mass of the erupted material. In the Calton Hill the same\r\nsequence may be observed. Underneath the andesites of Campbeltown comes\r\na well-marked and persistent band of olivine-dolerite. Still more basic\r\nare some portions of the earliest lavas of the Garleton plateau where,\r\nas already stated, rocks present themselves composed mainly of olivine\r\nand augite.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that where the lavas of a plateau diminish\r\ngreatly in thickness or become impersistent, the lowest basic group may\r\ncontinue while the overlying andesites disappear. This feature has been\r\nalready mentioned as well seen in the Midlothian plateau. The thick\r\ngroup of andesites in Arthur Seat and Calton Hill is not to be found\r\nin the next volcanic eminence, Craiglockhart Hill; but the basalts\r\nwith their underlying tuffs continue. In the south-western tract from\r\nHarper Rig to Hare Law in Lanarkshire, the thin lava-band, which can\r\nbe found only at intervals along the line of outcrop of the volcanic\r\nseries for about nine miles, is a dolerite often highly slaggy in\r\nstructure. Again, at Corrie in Arran, the lavas which appear upon the\r\nshore, apparently at the extreme western limits of the Clyde plateau,\r\nare basic rocks.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not the lowest and more basic lavas appear in any\r\nplateau, the main mass of the molten material erupted has usually\r\nconsisted of varieties of andesite. The successive discharges of\r\nthese intermediate lavas have flowed out in sheets, some of which\r\nmust have been little more than heaps of clinkers and scoriæ, while\r\nothers were more fluid and rolled along with a ropy or slaggy surface.\r\nOccasionally the upper part of an andesite shows the reddened and\r\ndecomposed character that suggests some degree of disintegration or\r\nweathering before the next lava-stream buried it. The intervals between\r\nsuccessive outflows of these lavas are not, as a rule, defined by any\r\nmarked breaks or by the intercalation of other material. In general,\r\nthe plateaux are mainly built up of successive sheets of lava which\r\nhave followed each other at intervals sufficiently short to prevent\r\nthe accumulation of much detritus between them. Thus the Campsie Hills\r\nhave the upper 600 feet of their mass formed of admirably-well-defined\r\nsheets of andesite, separated sometimes by thin partings of tuff, but\r\nmore usually only by the slaggy vesicular surfaces between successive\r\nflows.\r\n\r\nWhere the lavas consisted of trachytes they were apt to assume more\r\nirregular forms. Of this tendency the rocks of the Garleton Hills\r\nsupply an excellent example. As already stated, their lumpy character\r\ngives to these hills an outline which offers strong contrast to the\r\nordinary symmetrical terraced contours of the andesitic plateaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Section of Craiglockhart Hill, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n1. Red sandstones and clays; 2. Green stratified tuffs; 3. Columnar\r\nbasalt; 4. Dark shales, ironstones and sandstones, with plants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Section of the bottom of the Midlothian\r\nPlateau, Linnhouse Water above Mid-Calder Oilworks.\r\n\r\n1. Shales and cement-stones; 2. Sandstones; 3. Highly vesicular lava;\r\n4. Tuffs and sandstone bands. _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nAlthough tuffs play, on the whole, a comparatively unimportant part\r\namong the constituents of the plateaux, they attain in a few localities\r\nan exceptionally great development, and even where they occur only\r\nas thin partings between the successive lava-flows, they are always\r\ninteresting memorials of the volcanic activity of a district. In many\r\nportions of the plateaux, the lowest members of the volcanic series\r\nare tuffs and agglomerates, showing that the eruptions often began\r\nwith the discharge of fragmentary materials. Thus in the Midlothian\r\nplateau at Arthur Seat, though the lowest interbedded volcanic sheet\r\nis a dolerite, it is immediately followed by a series of bedded tuffs,\r\nbefore the main mass of the lavas of that hill make their appearance.\r\nAt Craiglockhart Hill, three miles distant (Fig. 115), this lowest lava\r\nis absent, and a group of tuffs about 300 feet thick rests immediately\r\non the red Carboniferous sandstones and shales, and is overlain by\r\nsheets of columnar basalt. The scoriaceous bottom of the latter rock\r\nmay here and there be seen to have cut out parts of the tuff as it\r\nrolled over the still unconsolidated material. In the same district, a\r\nfew miles further to the south-west, some interesting sections of the\r\nMidlothian plateau are laid bare in the streams which descend from the\r\nwestern slopes of the Pentland Hills. I may cite, in particular, those\r\nexposed in the course of the Linnhouse Water. At the railway viaduct\r\nnear the foot of Corston Hill, a good section is displayed of the\r\nCement-stone group--thick reddish, purplish, and greenish-blue marly\r\nshales or clays, with thin ribs and bands of cement-stone and grey\r\ncompact cyprid-limestone, as well as lenticular seams and thicker beds\r\nof grey shaly sandstone, sometimes full of ripple-marks and sun-cracks.\r\nThese strata, which exactly reproduce the typical lithological\r\ncharacters of the Cement-stone group of Stirlingshire (Ballagan Beds),\r\nAyrshire and Berwickshire, are surmounted by a group of reddish,\r\nyellow and brown sandstones, sometimes pebbly and containing a band of\r\nconglomerate. Among the stones in this band, pieces of the radiolarian\r\ncherts of the Lower Silurian series of the Southern Uplands are\r\nconspicuous, likewise pieces of andesite which may have come from the\r\nneighbouring Pentland Hills.\r\n\r\nAbove these strata lie the lavas of Corston Hill. These are highly\r\nvesicular in some parts, and include bands of tuff which are well\r\nexposed further down the same stream, immediately above the railway\r\nbridge near the Mid-Calder oilworks (Fig. 116). There the lavas, though\r\nmuch decomposed, show a highly vesicular structure with a rugged upper\r\nsurface, in the hollows and over the prominences of which fine flaky\r\nand sandy tuffs have been deposited, while thin seams of vesicular lava\r\nare intercalated among these strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Section of the top of the Midlothian Plateau\r\nin the Murieston Water.]\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the same plateau, as exposed in the course of the\r\nMurieston Water, contains evidence that the last eruptions consisted\r\nof tuff. The highly slaggy lava (1 in Fig. 117) is there surmounted\r\nby a thick mass of grey and greenish-white well-bedded granular tuff\r\n(2) including occasional lumps of the basic lava, and passing up into\r\nblack shale (3). But that the volcanic eruptions continued during\r\nthe accumulation of the shale is proved by the intercalation of thin\r\npartings and thicker layers of tuff in the black sediment. A short way\r\nhigher up the Burdiehouse Limestone comes in.\r\n\r\nThe great lava-escarpment of the Kilpatrick Hills rests on a continuous\r\nband of tuff which is thickest towards the west, near the group of\r\nvents above Dumbarton, while it thins away eastward and disappears in\r\nStrathblane, the lavas then forming the base of the volcanic series.\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable group of basal tuffs is that which\r\nunderlies the lavas of the Garleton plateau, to which further reference\r\nwill be immediately made.\r\n\r\nExtensive accumulations of tuff form in one or two localities a large\r\nproportion of the thickness of the whole volcanic series of a plateau.\r\nThus in the north-eastern part of Ayrshire, between Eaglesham and the\r\nvalley of the Irvine, the lavas die out for a space and give place to\r\ntuffs. During the discharge of the fragmentary materials over that\r\nground no lava seems to have flowed out for a long period. Ordinary\r\nsediment, however, mingled with the volcanic detritus, and there were\r\neven pauses in the eruptions when layers of ironstone were deposited,\r\ntogether with thin impure limestone that inclosed shells of _Productus\r\ngiganteus_.[430]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: Explanation of Sheet 22 _Geol. Surv. Scotland_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the plateaux, particularly within the older part of the\r\nvolcanic series, intercalations of ordinary sediment among the tuffs\r\nand lavas show that eruptions occurred only occasionally, and that\r\nduring the long intervals between them the deposition of sand and mud\r\nwent on as before. Thus the lower 400 feet of the Campsie Fells are\r\nbuilt up of slaggy andesites and thick beds of fine-grained stratified\r\ntuff, with bands of red, green and grey clays and cement-stone and\r\na zone of white sandstone. The Calton Hill at Edinburgh (Fig. 118)\r\naffords an excellent illustration of the interstratification both of\r\ntuffs and ordinary sediments among the successive outflows of lava.\r\nIn the total thickness of about 1100 feet of volcanic material in\r\nthis hill, at least eight intervals in the discharge of the lavas\r\nare marked by the intercalation of as many bands of nodular tuff,\r\ntogether with seams of shale and sandstone more or less charged with\r\nvolcanic detritus. The highest lava is immediately covered by the white\r\nsandstones and black shales of the Calciferous Sandstone series.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.--Section of Calton Hill, Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  1. Lower Carboniferous sandstones; 2. Basic lava at the bottom\r\n     of the volcanic series; 3. Tuff often interstratified with\r\n     sandstones and shales; 4. Sheets of andesite-lava frequently\r\n     separated by layers of tuff; 5. Shale passing into tuff; 6.\r\n     White sandstone and black carbonaceous shales overlying the\r\n     volcanic series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tuffs, as might be expected, are coarsest in texture and thickest\r\nin mass where they approach most nearly to some of the vents of\r\neruption, and, on the other hand, become finer as they recede from\r\nthese. As a rule, they are distinctly stratified, and consist of layers\r\nvarying in the size of their component lapilli. Here and there, near\r\nthe centres of discharge, the bedding becomes hardly traceable or\r\ndisappears, and the fragmentary materials take the form of agglomerate.\r\n\r\nIn the admirable range of coast-cliffs which extend from North Berwick\r\nto Dunbar, we learn that above the red sandstones at the base of the\r\nCarboniferous system, a thick pile of volcanic ashes was accumulated\r\nby numerous discharges from vents in the immediate neighbourhood. Some\r\nof the explosions were so vigorous that blocks of different lavas,\r\nsometimes a yard or more in length, were thrown out and heaped up in\r\nirregular mounds and hollows. Others discharged exceedingly fine dust,\r\nand between these two extremes every degree of coarseness of material\r\nmay be recognized.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the remarkable alternation of coarse and fine\r\nmaterials, according to the varying intensity of the volcanic paroxysm,\r\nFig. 119 is here introduced. It represents a portion of the tuff-cliffs\r\neast of Tantallon Castle, and shows at the bottom fine well-stratified\r\ntuff, over which a shower of large blocks of lava has fallen. Fine\r\ndetritus is seen to cover the deposits of this shower, and successive\r\ndischarges of large stones may be noticed higher up on more or less\r\nwell-defined horizons.\r\n\r\nThe space over which this pyroclastic material can now be traced,\r\nlarge though it is, does not represent the whole of the original area\r\nincluded within the range of the discharges of ash and stones, for\r\nmuch has been removed by denudation. During pauses of various length\r\nbetween the eruptions, waves and currents washed down the heaps of\r\nvolcanic material and distributed ordinary sediment over the bottom\r\nof the water. Hence, abundantly interstratified in some parts of the\r\ntuff, seams of sandstone, blue and green shale, cement-stone and\r\nlimestone occur. One thick band of limestone may be traced from near\r\nTynningham House to Whittinghame, a distance of about four miles;\r\nanother patch appears near Rockville House; and a third at Rhodes, near\r\nNorth Berwick. No fossils have been noticed in these limestones. The\r\ncalcareous matter, together sometimes with silica, appears to have been\r\nsupplied, at least in part, by springs, which may have been connected\r\nwith the volcanic phenomena of the district. The North Berwick\r\nlimestone, in particular, has the peculiar carious wavy structure with\r\nminute mamillated interstices so common among sinters. It contains\r\ngrains of pyrites, flakes of white kaolin, which probably represent\r\ndecayed prisms or tufts of natrolite, and cavities lined with dog-tooth\r\nspar. Some portions give out a strongly fœtid odour when freshly broken.\r\n\r\nAfter the tuffs of the Garleton plateau had accumulated to a depth\r\nof perhaps 200 feet or more, lavas began to be poured out. First\r\ncame basic outflows (olivine-basalts with picrites) and andesites\r\n(porphyrites), which form a thin but continuous sheet all over the\r\narea. These were succeeded by the series of trachytes which distinguish\r\nthis area. Although the observer remarks the absence there of the usual\r\nterraced arrangement, yet from some points of view, particularly from\r\nthe westward, a succession of low escarpments and longer dip-slopes can\r\nbe detected among the trachytes of the Garleton Hills, while there can\r\nbe no doubt that, in spite of their irregular lumpy contours, these\r\nlavas lie as a great cake above the lower platform of more basic flows\r\n(Fig. 10). There is evidence that during the emission of the trachytes\r\noccasional eruptions of andesite took place. Not the least striking and\r\ninteresting feature of this plateau is the size and distribution of its\r\nnecks, to which reference will be made in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe latest eruption in the Garleton area had ceased and the cones\r\nand lava sheets had probably been buried under sediment before the\r\ncommencement of the deposition of the Hurlet or thick Main Limestone of\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone series which lies immediately to the west\r\nof the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs of the plateaux are seldom fossiliferous, probably for\r\nthe same reason that fossils are scarce in the Cement-stone group\r\nwhich the plateau volcanic rocks overspread and with which they are\r\ninterstratified. Occasional stems and other fragments of vegetation\r\noccur in the plateau-tuffs, as in those of North Berwick, where I have\r\nfound a decayed coniferous trunk three feet in length. The green tuff\r\nat the base of the volcanic group of Arthur Seat contains abundant\r\nmacerated plant-remains, together with scales of _Rhizodus_ and other\r\nfishes. In some places the plants are represented by trunks or roots,\r\nwhich appear to remain in their positions of growth. A remarkable\r\ninstance of this nature occurs in some bands of tuff in the volcanic\r\ngroup of the east coast of the Isle of Arran, first brought to notice\r\nby Mr. E.

Trans._ 1871-1883.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--Cliff of tuff and agglomerate, east side\r\nof Oxroad Bay, a little east from Tantallon Castle, East Lothian.]\r\n\r\nPlant-remains also occasionally occur in the stratified layers\r\nintercalated among the lavas and tuffs of the plateaux. Some of the\r\nbest examples of their occurrence are to be found in the shales and\r\ntuffs interstratified among the enormous pile of volcanic material near\r\nBowling. Not only does abundant vegetable debris occur distributed\r\nthrough the detrital strata in the volcanic series at that locality,\r\nbut it is even aggregated into thin seams of coal which have been\r\nexamined and described by various observers.[433] It may be remarked\r\nthat the plant remains thus found intercalated in the volcanic series,\r\nespecially when they have been entombed in tuff, have often had their\r\ninternal structure admirably preserved, the organic tissues having\r\nbeen delicately replaced by calcite or other petrifying medium.\r\nThe remarkably perfect structure of some of these plants has been\r\ndemonstrated by Professor Williamson, especially in the case of the\r\nArran deposit just referred to. Mr. John Young has also found the\r\nstructure well preserved among the _Sigillariæ_ and _Stigmariæ_ that\r\noccur in the stratified intercalations between the lavas near Bowling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: See in particular J. Young, _Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow_,\r\nvol. iv.

These materials were mingled with a gradually\r\nincreasing proportion of ordinary mechanical sediment, which finally\r\noverspread and buried the volcanic tracts of ground, as these slowly\r\nsank in the general subsidence of the region. The characteristic\r\ncorals, crinoids and shells of the Carboniferous Limestone begin to\r\nappear in these ashy sediments. There is thus an insensible passage\r\nfrom volcanic detritus into fossiliferous shales and limestones.\r\nExamples of this gradation may be seen in many natural sections along\r\nthe flanks of the Ayrshire plateau from above Kilbirnie to Strathavon.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to fix in some quarters the limits beyond which\r\nneither the lavas nor the tuffs extended, and thus partially to map out\r\nthe original areas of the plateaux. For example, in certain directions\r\nthe Carboniferous formations can be followed continuously downward\r\nbelow the Main Limestone, without the intervention of any volcanic\r\nmaterial, or with only a slight intermixture of fine volcanic lapilli,\r\nsuch as might have been carried by a strong wind from some neighbouring\r\nactive vents. By this kind of evidence and by the proved thinning-out\r\nof the materials of the plateau, we can demonstrate that in the north\r\nof Ayrshire the southern limits of the great volcanic bank did not\r\npass beyond a line drawn from near Ardrossan to Galston. We can show,\r\ntoo, that the lavas of the Campsie Fells ended off about a mile beyond\r\nStirling before they reached the line of the Ochil heights, and that\r\nthe _coulées_ which flowed from the Solway vents did not quite join\r\nwith those from the Berwickshire volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Diagram illustrating the thinning away\r\nsouthwards of the lavas of the Clyde Plateau between Largs and\r\nArdrossan. Length about 10 miles.\r\n\r\n1. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 2. Sandstones, shales, etc., with \"Ballagan\r\nBeds\"; 3. Tuffs; 4. Andesite lavas; 5. Carboniferous Limestone series.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, evidence enough remains to enable us to form a tolerably\r\nclear conception of the original average slopes of the surface of some\r\nof the plateaux. Thus in the great escarpment above Largs and the high\r\nground eastward to Kilbirnie the volcanic series, as already stated,\r\nmust be at least 1500 feet thick. This thick mass of lavas and tuffs\r\nthins away southwards and probably disappears a short distance south\r\nfrom Ardrossan in a space of about ten miles (Fig. 121). The original\r\nsouthward slope of the plateau would thus appear to have been about 1\r\nin 35. Again, the northward slope of the same plateau may be estimated\r\nfrom observations in the Campsie Fells. We have seen that above Kilsyth\r\nthe total depth of the volcanic sheets is about 1000 feet, while to the\r\nwestward it is much thicker. From the top of the Meikle Bin (1870 feet)\r\nabove Kilsyth north-eastwards to Causewayhead, where the whole volcanic\r\nseries has died out, is a distance of 12 miles, so that the slope of\r\nthe surface of erupted materials on this side was about 1 in 63 (Fig.\r\n122).\r\n\r\nJudging from the sections exposed along the faces of the escarpments,\r\nwe may infer that the volcanic sheets had a tolerably uniform surface\r\nwhich sloped gently away from the chief vents, but with local\r\ninequalities according to the irregularities of the lava-streams\r\nthat were heaped up round the vents and flowed outward in different\r\ndirections and to various distances from them. At the beginning, these\r\nflat volcanic domes were certainly subaqueous. While they were being\r\nformed, continuous subsidence appears to have been in progress. But the\r\ngreat thickness of the volcanic accumulations, as in the Kilpatrick\r\nand Renfrewshire areas, and the paucity of ordinary sedimentary strata\r\namong them, make it not improbable that at least their higher parts\r\nrose above the water. Where this was the case there may have been\r\nconsiderable degradation of the lava-banks before these were reduced\r\nor were by subsidence submerged beneath the water-level. Evidence of\r\nthis waste is probably to be recognized in the bands of conglomerate,\r\noccasionally of considerable thickness, which, particularly in some\r\nparts of Ayrshire, intervene between the top of the volcanic group and\r\nthe Hurlet Limestone. As I shall have occasion to point out further\r\non, there seems to be some amount of evidence in favour of the view\r\nthat a considerable interval of time elapsed between the close of the\r\nplateau-eruptions and the date of that widespread depression which led\r\nto the deposition of the Hurlet Limestone over the whole of Central\r\nScotland. If such an interval did occur it would include a prolonged\r\nabrasion of any projecting parts of the plateaux, and the production\r\nand deposition of volcanic conglomerate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--Diagram illustrating the thinning away\r\neastwards of the lavas of the Clyde Plateau in the Fintry Hills.

VENTS\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the external forms, internal contents and\r\ndistribution of the vents from which the material of the plateaux was\r\ndischarged. In the Carboniferous system these interesting relics of\r\nformer volcanoes are far more distinctly defined and better preserved\r\nthan in older geological formations. Moreover, in Scotland, they are\r\nlaid bare to greater advantage, both inland and along the sea-coast,\r\nand may indeed be studied there as typical illustrations of this kind\r\nof geological structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--View of the two necks Dumgoyn and Dumfoyn,\r\nStirlingshire, taken from the south.\r\n\r\nThese two necks form a conspicuous feature in front of and below the\r\nlava plateau, a portion of which is shown on the right hand. The\r\nground-plan of the same necks is shown in Fig. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--Ground-plan of Plateau-vents near\r\nStrathblane, Stirlingshire, on the scale of 6 inches to a mile.]\r\n\r\nIn external form the necks connected both with the plateaux and the\r\npuys generally rise from the surrounding ground as isolated, rounded,\r\nconical or dome-shaped prominences, their details of contour depending\r\nmainly upon the materials of which they consist. When these materials\r\nare of agglomerate, tuff or other readily disintegrated rock, the\r\nsurface of the domes is generally smooth and grass-covered. Where, on\r\nthe other hand, they consist wholly or in part of dolerite, basalt,\r\ndiabase, andesite, trachyte or other crystalline rock, they present\r\nmore irregular rocky outlines. Illustrations of some of those varying\r\nforms are given in Figs. 23 and 123. In rare instances the vent is\r\nmarked at the surface not by a hill but by a hollow, as in the great\r\nneck in the heart of the Campsie Fells (Fig. 128).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Ground-plans of double and triple necks in\r\nthe Plateau series, on the scale of 6 inches to a mile.\r\n\r\nA. Barwood Hill and Ravenscraig, east of Dumbarton, double vent. B. The\r\nKnock Hill, Largs, Ayrshire, double vent (see Fig. 23). C. Dumbowie and\r\nDumbuck, east of Dumbarton, triple vent.]\r\n\r\nAs regards their ground-plan, which affords a cross-section of the\r\noriginal volcanic funnel, the plateau-vents present considerable\r\nvariety. The simplest cases are those in which the form is\r\napproximately circular or somewhat elliptical. Here the outline\r\ncorresponds to the cross-section of a single and normal orifice. Some\r\nexamples of this simple type are given in Fig. 124, which represents\r\na group of vents on the edge of the Clyde plateau near Strathblane.\r\nThe two larger necks here shown are the same which appear in the\r\nview in Fig. 123.[434] Where two vents have been successively opened\r\nclose to each other, or where the same vent has shifted its position,\r\nthe ground-plan may be greatly modified. In some instances the double\r\nfunnel can be distinctly traced. Thus in the conspicuous Knock Hill\r\nabove Largs in Ayrshire (Fig. 125, B) there are two conjoined necks,\r\nand such appears to be also the structure shown by the ground-plan of\r\nthe neck of Barwood Hill and Raven's Craig, east of Dumbarton (Fig.\r\n125, A).[435] But more complex forms occur which point to a still\r\nlarger number of coalescing necks. A group of hills to the east of\r\nDumbarton gives the ground-plan shown in C, Fig. 125, where traces may\r\nbe detected of three separate vents. Still more irregular are long\r\nnarrow dyke-like masses of tuff or agglomerate which have probably\r\nrisen along lines of fissure (Fig. 22, No. 1). The most striking\r\nexample of these, however, occur in association with the puys and will\r\nbe described in later pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: The illustrations in Figs. 124 and 125 are taken from\r\nthe field-maps of the Geological Survey on the scale of 6 inches to a\r\nmile. The ground represented in Fig. 124 was mapped by Mr. R. L. Jack.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: These ground-plans are likewise taken from the\r\nfield-maps of the Geological Survey. A and C were mapped by Mr. Jack, B\r\nby myself. The shaded parts are intrusive andesites and dolerites; the\r\ndark bars in A and C being dolerite dykes of much later date than the\r\nnecks. The dotted portions mark tuff and agglomerate.]\r\n\r\nConnected with their ground-plan is the relative size of the\r\nplateau-vents. On the whole they are larger than those of the puy\r\nseries. The simple circular or elliptical type presents the smallest\r\nnecks, some of them not exceeding 100 feet in diameter. The more\r\ncomplex forms are generally also of larger dimensions. By much the\r\nlargest vent or connected group of vents is that which lies among the\r\nuplands of Misty Law in the heart of the Renfrewshire part of the Clyde\r\nplateau, where a connected mass of tuff and agglomerate now occupies a\r\nspace of about 4 miles in length by 2½ miles in breadth (Fig. 129). It\r\nhas not been found possible, however, to trace the boundaries of the\r\nseparate vents of this tract, nor to distinguish the material of the\r\nnecks from that which surrounds them. Another large mass which from its\r\nshape may be conjectured to represent more than one vent is the great\r\ntract north of Melrose, which measures 8800 by 4200 feet.[436]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: The following measurements are, like those in the text,\r\ntaken from the field-maps of the Geological Survey. Carewood Rig, on\r\nthe borders of Roxburghshire and Dumfriesshire, 7000 × 2400 feet; the\r\ngreat vent in the middle of the Campsie Fells, 5200 × 2600; Black Law,\r\nbetween Bedrule and Jedburgh, 3400 × 1600; Dumgoyn, Strathblane, 2300 ×\r\n1300; Rubers Law, 1500 × 1000; Minto Hill (south), 2300 × 1650; Minto\r\nHill (north), 1500 × 1100; Doughnot Hill, Kilpatrick range, 1000 × 700;\r\nfour of the smallest agglomerate vents along the northern escarpment\r\nof the Clyde plateau between Strathblane and Fintry, 500 × 450, 450 ×\r\n400, 250 × 100, 200 × 200; Pike Law, Arkleton, Tarras Water, 500 × 500;\r\nHarwood, Stonedge, 5 miles S.E. from Hawick, 500 × 300; Arkleton Burn,\r\nDumfriesshire, 400 × 100; Dalbate Burn, 250 × 120.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the necks can best be understood from the maps\r\nof the Geological Survey, where they have been carefully indicated.\r\nAs might have been expected, they are not found outside the original\r\nlimits within which it may be reasonably inferred that the lavas\r\nand tuffs were erupted. They occur most abundantly and attain their\r\nlargest size in and around the districts where the plateaux are most\r\nextensively developed. No doubt a large number of them are concealed\r\nunder these plateaux. A few appear at the surface among the lavas and\r\ntuffs, but by far the largest number now visible have been revealed by\r\ndenudation, the escarpments having been cut back so as to lay bare the\r\nunderlying rocks through which the necks rise. Thus, along the flanks\r\nof the great escarpment that extends from near Stirling by Fintry and\r\nStrathblane to Dumbarton, more than two dozen of agglomerate necks\r\nmay be counted in a distance of about sixteen miles, while if the\r\nnecks of lava-form material are included, the number of vents must be\r\nabout fifty. Nowhere in Scotland do such necks form a more conspicuous\r\nfeature in the scenery as well as the geology than they do between\r\nFintry and Strathblane, where, standing out as bold isolated hills in\r\nfront of the escarpments, their conical and rounded outlines present\r\na striking contrast to the terraced escarpments behind them. I would\r\nespecially refer again to the two remarkable cones of Dumfoyn and\r\nDumgoyn above Strathblane (Figs. 123, 124, 127). Along the west front\r\nof the hills between Gourock and Ardrossan seventeen agglomerate-vents\r\noccur in a distance of sixteen miles. In Roxburghshire a group of large\r\nagglomerate-necks is dotted over the Silurian country around Melrose\r\nand Selkirk[437] (see Fig. 130).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: In this region and farther southward, besides the\r\nplateau-eruptions, a later group of puys is to be seen, and it is\r\ndifficult to discriminate between the necks belonging to the two\r\ngroups. Those which lie to the east are probably connected with the\r\nplateaux, those to the west with the puys. The latter are referred to\r\non p. 475.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.--Ground-plan of tuff-neck, shore east of\r\nDunbar.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding rocks are sandstones, which are much hardened round\r\nthe vent in the zone marked by the short divergent lines. The arrows\r\nmark the direction of dip. See \"Geology of East Lothian,\" _Mem. Geol.\r\nSurvey_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence of these necks it is plain that the volcanic\r\nmaterials of the plateaux must in each case have been supplied not from\r\ngreat central orifices, but from abundant vents standing sometimes\r\nsingly, with intervening spaces of several miles, often in groups of\r\nfour or five within a single square mile.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the country, it is seldom possible to examine the\r\nactual junction of necks with the rocks through which they rise, the\r\nboundary-line being usually obscured by debris or herbage. On the\r\ncoast, the vents of the plateaux have not been bared by the sea so\r\nfully as in the case of the much younger series of the east of Fife\r\nto be described in later pages. But where the East Lothian plateau\r\ntouches the shore, the waves have laid bare a number of its minor\r\nvents, which have thus been dissected in ground-plan on the beach. As\r\nan illustration of these vents an example is given in Fig. 126, from\r\nthe shore east of Dunbar. Here the sandstones, which are inclined\r\nin an easterly direction at 20° to 25°, are pierced by an irregular\r\nmass of tuff. It is observable that in this instance long tongue-like\r\nprojections of the sandstones protrude into the neck; more frequently\r\nthe material of a neck sends veins or dykes into the surrounding walls.\r\nA volcanic chimney would seem to have been often much shattered and\r\nfissured in the course of the volcanic explosions, and the fragmentary\r\nmaterial has fallen or been injected into the rents thus caused. As a\r\nrule, the rocks immediately around the Carboniferous necks are more or\r\nless indurated, as in this instance from the Dunbar shore.\r\n\r\nThe materials which have filled up the vents connected with the\r\nplateau-eruptions generally consist of (_a_) agglomerates or tuffs, but\r\noccasionally of (_b_) some kind of lava, and frequently (_c_) of both\r\nthese kinds of rock combined.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Necks of Agglomerate or Tuff._--These materials vary greatly\r\nin the nature and relative proportions of their constituents. Usually\r\nthe included blocks and lapilli are pieces of andesite, diabase,\r\nbasalt or other lava, like the rocks of the plateaux. But with these\r\noccur also fragments probably detached from the sides of the funnels\r\nthrough which the explosions took place, such as pieces of greywacke,\r\nsandstone, limestone and shale. Considerable induration may be observed\r\namong these non-volcanic ingredients. In some cases, as in that of the\r\noccurrence of pieces of granite referred to on p. 382, the stones have\r\nprobably been brought up from some considerable depth. In others it is\r\neasy to see that the blocks have slipped down from some higher group\r\nof strata now removed from the surrounding surface by denudation. Some\r\nstriking illustrations of this feature will be cited from necks of the\r\npuy-series in the south of Roxburghshire (p. 476).\r\n\r\nThe lava blocks in the tuffs and agglomerates are usually rounded or\r\nsubangular. Pear-shaped blocks, or flattened discs, or hollow spherical\r\nballs are hardly ever to be observed, though I have noticed a few\r\nexamples in the tuffs of Dunbar. A frequent character of the blocks\r\nis that of roughly rounded, highly amygdaloidal pieces of lava, the\r\ncellular structure being specially developed in the interior, and the\r\ncells on the outside being often much drawn out round the circumference\r\nof the mass. Such blocks were probably torn from the cavernous,\r\npartially consolidated, or at least rather viscous, top of a lava\r\ncolumn. Most of the stones, however, suggest that they were produced\r\nby the explosion of already solidified lava, and were somewhat rounded\r\nby attrition in their ascent and descent. The vents filled with such\r\nmaterials must have been the scene of prolonged and intermittent\r\nactivity; successive paroxysms resulting in the clearing out of the\r\nhardened lava column in the throat of the volcano, and in the rise of\r\nfresh lava, with abundant ejection of dust and lapilli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.--Section across the vents Dumgoyn and Dumfoyn,\r\nand the edge of the Clyde plateau above Strathblane, Stirlingshire.\r\n\r\n  1.

As examples of them I may refer to the\r\nseries already mentioned as fronting the escarpment of the Clyde\r\nplateau from Fintry to Largs. Another interesting group rises through\r\nthe Silurian and Old Red Sandstone rocks to the west of the escarpment\r\nof the Berwickshire plateau, that near Melrose forming one of the\r\nlargest in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.--Section through the large vent of the Campsie\r\nHills.\r\n\r\n1.

In Fig. 127, a section is drawn through the two\r\nnecks Dumgoyn and Dumfoyn, which have already been shown in outline and\r\nin ground-plan. The relation of these two vents to the neighbouring\r\nplateau to the right can here be seen. Fig. 128 gives a section taken\r\nthrough the great vent of the Campsie Hills, with the minor adjacent\r\nnecks of Dungoil, Bin Bairn, and the Meikle Bin.\r\n\r\nThe diagram in Fig. 129 is meant to convey in a general way what\r\nappears to be the structure of the central vent of the Renfrewshire\r\nplateaux, to be afterwards referred to. But, as already mentioned, the\r\nlimits of the various rocks are too much obscured to allow an accurate\r\ndelineation to be given of their areas and relations to each other. The\r\nBerwickshire plateau supplies abundant interesting examples of tuff\r\nnecks which rise through the Old Red Sandstone many miles distant from\r\nthe edge of the lavas. This structure is shown in Fig. 130.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--Section across Southern Berwickshire to show\r\nthe relation of the volcanic plateau to the vents lying south from it.\r\n\r\n1. Upper Silurian strata; 2. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 3. The volcanic\r\nplateau; 4. Agglomerate and tuff of the vents; 5. Basalt and dolerite;\r\n6. Lower Carboniferous strata.]\r\n\r\nIndications may occasionally be observed of an agglomerate vent having\r\nbeen first occupied by one kind of material and then, after being in\r\ngreat measure cleared out by explosions, having been subsequently\r\nfilled up with another. As an example of this structure I may cite\r\nagain the double neck of the Knock Hill a little to the north of Largs,\r\nof which the outline is shown in Fig. 23, and the ground-plan in Fig.\r\n125, B. This hill rises from the red sandstone slopes that front the\r\ngreat Ayrshire plateau and forms a conspicuous cone the top of which\r\nis rather more than 700 feet above the sea. Its summit commands a\r\nremarkably extensive and interesting panorama of the scenery of the\r\nClyde, but to the geologist perhaps the most striking feature in the\r\nlandscape is the range of terraced hills behind, mounting up into the\r\ngreat vents of the Renfrewshire uplands. On these declivities the\r\nsuccessive lava-streams that have built up the plateau can be seen\r\npiled over each other for a thickness of more than 1000 feet, and\r\npresenting their escarpments as parallel lines of brown crag with green\r\nslopes between.\r\n\r\nThe Knock has had its upper part artificially dressed, for lines of\r\ntrench have been cut out of its rocks by some early race that converted\r\nthe summit of the hill into a strongly intrenched camp. From the apex\r\nof the cone the ground falls rapidly westward into a hollow, beyond\r\nwhich rises a lower rounded ridge of similar materials. It is possible\r\nthat this western ridge may really form part of the main hill, but\r\nthe grass-covered ground does not afford sufficient exposures of the\r\nrocks to settle this point. From the contours of the surface, it may\r\nbe inferred that there are two closely adjacent vents, and that the\r\nwestern and lower eminence is the older of the two. This hill or\r\nridge consists partly of a coarse agglomerate, and partly of veins and\r\nirregular protrusions of a dark, compact, slightly cellular lava. The\r\nstones in the fragmental rock are different olivine-basalts, or other\r\nbasic lavas, and sandstones. The paste is rough, loose and granular.\r\nThe sandstone fragments are much indurated and sometimes bleached.\r\n\r\nThe Knock itself is formed mainly of a remarkably coarse and strikingly\r\nvolcanic agglomerate. Round the outside, and particularly on the\r\nsouth-east, the rock is finer in texture, compact, and gravelly, or\r\nlike a mudstone, with few or no imbedded blocks, dull-green to red in\r\ncolour, and breaking with a clean fracture which shows angular lapilli\r\nof various basalts or diabases. At the southern end of the neck, where\r\nthe surrounding red sandstone can be seen within a few feet of the\r\ntuff, the latter is bright red in colour, and contains much debris of\r\nred sandstone and marl. Possibly this finer tuff, which is traceable\r\nas an irregular band round the outside of the neck, may mark an older\r\ninfilling of the vent than the agglomerate of the centre; but there\r\nis no sharp line to be drawn between the two, though a hollow can\r\nsometimes be traced on the surface where they join.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate of this locality is one of the most characteristic\r\namong the plateau-necks of the Clyde region. Its blocks sometimes\r\nmeasure from two to three feet in diameter. They consist almost\r\nwholly of a dark crystalline porphyritic olivine-basalt. These blocks\r\nare subangular in form, often with clean-fractured surfaces. Though\r\noccasionally slightly cellular, they are never slaggy so far as I could\r\nsee, nor are any true scoriæ to be noticed among them. The blocks\r\nsuggest that they were derived from the disruption of an already\r\nsolidified mass of lava. The agglomerate is entirely without any trace\r\nof stratification.\r\n\r\nThrough this tumultuous accumulation of volcanic debris some irregular\r\nveins of olivine-basalt, sometimes glassy in structure, have been\r\ninjected, and reach nearly to the summit of the hill. This intrusive\r\nmaterial resembles generally some of the dark intrusive masses in the\r\nDumbartonshire necks. Like these, it exhibits a tendency to assume a\r\nmore or less distinctly columnar structure, its columns having the same\r\ncharacteristic wavy sides and irregular curvature. The intrusive rocks\r\nin the two eminences of the Knock may be paralleled among the stones\r\nin the agglomerate. The neck on its north-eastern side rises steeply\r\nfrom the red sandstones which it pierces, but which, although they are\r\nmuch jointed and broken, are not sensibly indurated. Unfortunately the\r\nactual junction of the igneous and sedimentary rocks is concealed under\r\nherbage.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the fragmental materials of the plateau-necks are quite\r\nunstratified. Their included blocks, distributed irregularly through\r\nthe mass, have evidently undergone little or no assortment after\r\nthey fell back into the vents. Occasionally, however, a more or less\r\ndistinct bedding of the agglomerate or tuff may be observed, the\r\nlayers having a tendency to dip inward into the centre. One of the\r\nmost conspicuous examples of this structure is to be found in the\r\nhill of Dumbuck, to the east of Dumbarton. This neck, which forms\r\nso prominent a feature in the landscape, presents a precipitous\r\nface towards the south, and allows the disposition of its component\r\nmaterials to be there seen. The agglomerate consists of a succession\r\nof rudely stratified beds of coarser and finer detritus, which on both\r\nsides are inclined towards the centre, where a plug of fine-grained\r\nolivine-basalt has risen and spread out into a columnar sheet above\r\n(Fig. 131). In general form this basalt resembles such intrusions as\r\nthat of Largo Law, to be afterwards described (Fig. 226), where what\r\nmay have been the hollow or bottom of the crater is filled with basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Section of south end of Dumbuck Hill.

Phonolite neck.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Necks of Andesite, Trachyte, Dolerite, Diabase, or other massive\r\nRock._--When the vents have been filled by the uprise of some molten\r\nrock, it is generally, as we have seen, of a more acid character than\r\nthe ordinary lavas of the plateaux. Frequently it consists of some\r\nvariety of trachyte or andesite, commonly of a dull yellow or grey\r\ntint and waxy lustre. Good examples may be seen among the remarkable\r\ngroup of necks on either side of the valley north of the village of\r\nStrathblane and in those above Bowling. The three great necks in East\r\nLothian, already alluded to,--Traprain Law (Figs. 132, 133), North\r\nBerwick Law (Fig. 109), and the Bass Rock (Fig. 110)--are masses\r\nof phonolite and trachyte, obviously related to the trachytes of\r\nthe adjacent plateau. A smaller but very perfect instance of a vent\r\nsimilarly filled is to be seen in the same neighbourhood on the shore\r\nto the east of North Berwick Law.[438]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: See \"Geology of East Lothian,\" _Geological Survey\r\nMemoir_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nExamples occur where the funnels of eruption have been finally sealed\r\nup by the rise of more basic material, and this has happened even in\r\na district where most of the lava-form necks consist of trachyte or\r\nsome other intermediate lava. Thus, in the Campsie Fells, several such\r\nbosses appear, of which the most conspicuous forms the hill of Dungoil\r\n(1396 feet, Fig. 128). Further west, among the Kilpatrick Hills, bosses\r\nof this kind are still more numerous. The group of bosses near Ancrum\r\nand Jedburgh is mainly made up of olivine-dolerites and olivine-basalts\r\n(Fig. 130). This more basic composition of itself suggests that\r\nthese bosses may be connected rather with the puy- than with the\r\nplateau-eruptions.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Necks of Composite Character._--In not a few examples, the vents\r\nhave been filled with agglomerate which has been pierced by a plug\r\nor veins of lava-form material. Many illustrations of this composite\r\nstructure may be observed along the west front of the great escarpments\r\nfrom Fintry to Ardrossan (see Figs. 124, 125, 127 and 128). In that\r\nregion the intruded rock is often a dull yellowish or grey trachytic\r\nor andesitic material. Olivine-basalt is the chief rock intruded in\r\nthe vents in the Dumbarton district. Among the Roxburghshire vents,\r\nwhere the injected material is commonly olivine-basalt or dolerite, it\r\noccasionally happens, as in Rubers Law, that the uprise of the lava has\r\nalmost entirely cleared out or concealed the agglomerate, and in some\r\nof the bosses, where no agglomerate is now to be seen, the basalt may\r\nhave taken its place (Fig. 130).\r\n\r\nThe largest and most interesting vents connected with this type of\r\nCarboniferous volcano, are those which occur within the limits of\r\nthe plateaux, where they are still surrounded with lavas and tuffs\r\nthat probably came out of them. Of these by far the most extensive\r\nand remarkable lies among the high moorlands of Renfrewshire between\r\nLargs and Lochwinnoch, where the ground rises to more than 1700 feet\r\nabove the sea (see Fig. 129). This area, as already remarked, is\r\nunfortunately much obscured with drift and peat, so that the limits\r\nof its rocks cannot be so satisfactorily traced as might be desired.\r\nI think it probable that several successive vents have here been\r\nopened close to each other, but their erupted ashes probably cannot be\r\ndistinguished. Over a space measuring about four miles in length by\r\ntwo and a half in breadth, the rocks exposed at the surface are fine\r\ntuffs, breccias and coarse agglomerates, largely made up of trachytic,\r\nandesitic or felsitic material, and pierced by innumerable protrusions\r\nof various andesitic, trachytic or felsitic rocks in bosses and veins,\r\nas well as also by dykes of a more basic kind, such as dolerites and\r\nbasalts. Some of the tuffs present a curiously indurated condition; and\r\nthey are frequently much decayed at the surface.[439] Another large\r\nmass of tuff and agglomerate lies a little to the south-west of the\r\nmain area.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: This tract of ground was mapped for the Geological\r\nSurvey by Mr. R. L. Jack, now in charge of the Geological Survey of\r\nQueensland. See Sheet 31, _Geological Survey of Scotland_.]\r\n\r\nAfter the explosions ceased, by which the vents were opened and the\r\ncones of debris were heaped up, heated vapours would in many cases,\r\nas in modern volcanoes, continue for a long while to ascend in the\r\nfunnels. The experiments of Daubrée on the effects of water and vapour\r\nupon silicates under great pressure and at a low red heat, have shown\r\nhow great may be the lithological changes thereby superinduced. It\r\nis improbable that where a mass of tuff and lava, lying deep within\r\na volcanic vent, was thoroughly permeated with constantly ascending\r\nheated vapours, it should escape some kind of change. I am inclined to\r\nattribute to this cause the frequent conversion of the sandstones round\r\nthe walls of the vents into quartzite. The most remarkable example of\r\nmetamorphism within a vent which I have observed among the plateaux,\r\noccurs in the heart of the Campsie Fells, where, instead of forming\r\na prominence, the neck is marked by a great hollow, measuring about\r\na mile in length and half a mile in breadth (Fig. 128).[440] It is\r\noccupied mainly by a coarse tumultuous agglomerate, like that of other\r\nnecks in the same district, but with a matrix rather more indurated,\r\nand assuming in certain parts a crystalline texture, so as to be\r\nat first sight hardly distinguishable from some of the surrounding\r\nandesites. Even in this altered condition, however, its included\r\nfragments may be recognized, particularly blocks of sandstone which\r\nhave been hardened into quartzite. Numerous small veins of pink and\r\nyellow trachyte traverse the agglomerate, and are found also cutting\r\nthe bedded andesites that encircle it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: See Explanation to Sheet 31, _Geological Survey of\r\nScotland_, par. 21 (1878).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.--View of Traprain Law from the south, a\r\nphonolite neck of the Garleton Plateau.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DYKES AND SILLS\r\n\r\nIntrusive masses both in the form of dykes and of sills are of frequent\r\noccurrence in connection with the Carboniferous volcanic plateaux. From\r\nthe variety of their component materials it may be inferred that these\r\nrocks belong to different ages of intrusion.\r\n\r\nDykes.--The great majority of the Dykes consist of trachyte or of\r\nandesite, resembling in lithological characters the material of the\r\nnecks and doubtless connected with its uprise. There occur also dykes\r\nof diabase, basalt or dolerite. Some of the latter, especially those\r\nwhich run for many miles, cutting every rock in the districts in\r\nwhich they occur, and crossing large faults without deviation, are\r\ncertainly long posterior to the plateau volcanic period. Whether the\r\nsmall inconstant dykes of more basic composition, found in the same\r\ndistricts with the trachytes, are to be looked upon as part of the\r\nvolcanic phenomena of the plateaux, is a question to which at present\r\nno definite answer can be given. I shall have occasion to show that in\r\nthe next volcanic period the lavas that flowed from the puys are more\r\nbasic than most of those of the plateaux, and that they are associated\r\nwith more basic dykes and sills. In Roxburghshire, where it is so\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the denuded vents of the two periods,\r\nthe dark heavy olivine-basalts and dolerites of the bosses may possibly\r\nbelong rather to the later than to the earlier volcanic episode. And if\r\nthat be their true age, the dykes of similar material may be connected\r\nwith them. At the same time it must be remembered that the earliest\r\neruptions of the plateaux were markedly basic, that many vents in the\r\nplateaux are pierced by basic intrusions, and that basic dykes may have\r\nbeen associated with the uprise of the same magma.\r\n\r\nThe dykes occur in considerable numbers and in two distinct positions,\r\nthough these may be closely related to each other: 1st, among the rocks\r\noutside and beneath the plateau-lavas, or cutting these lavas; and 2nd,\r\nin and around the vents.\r\n\r\n1. Among the rocks which emerge from under the Carboniferous volcanic\r\nplateaux, dykes are sometimes to be observed in considerable numbers.\r\nThey may be compared to the far more extensive series connected\r\nwith the Tertiary basalt-plateaux, like which they may have had a\r\nclose relation to the actual building up of the successive sheets\r\nof andesite, trachyte and basalt that were erupted at the surface.\r\nThey are particularly well developed in the Clyde plateau, where\r\nby extensive denudation they have been admirably exposed. I would\r\nespecially refer to those that traverse the tract of red sandstones\r\nwhich underlie the volcanic series along the flanks of the great\r\nescarpments from Fintry to Strathblane and Dumbarton, and between\r\nGourock and Ardrossan. These dykes have been dissected by the sea along\r\nboth sides of the estuary of the Clyde and in the islands of Cumbrae.\r\nIn these islands and in Bute they have recently been mapped in great\r\ndetail for the Geological Survey by my colleague, Mr. W. Gunn, who has\r\nsupplied me with notes of his observations on the subject, from which\r\nthe following summary is compiled.\r\n\r\n\"There are at least four distinct groups of intrusive rocks in the\r\nGreater Cumbrae. The oldest of these is trachytic in character, and\r\noccurs both as dykes and sheets, which run generally in the same E.N.E.\r\ndirection. The rock is usually pinkish in colour, sometimes grey or\r\npurplish. A specimen from the dyke of the Hawk's Nest, north of Farland\r\nPoint, analyzed by Mr. Teall, was found to contain 11 per cent of\r\nalkalies, principally potash, while the percentages of lime and iron\r\nwere very low. Sometimes these rocks are fine in grain with only a few\r\nporphyritic orthoclase crystals, though numerous small crystals of this\r\nmineral are found with the aid of the microscope. These red trachyte\r\ndykes are almost confined to the Upper Old Red Sandstone, rarely\r\nentering the overlying white Calciferous Sandstones, and never invading\r\nthe plateau-lavas. They are therefore probably of early Carboniferous\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\"The next group follows the same general direction, but clearly\r\ntraverses the trachytes, and must therefore be of later date. The dykes\r\nof this group are the most numerous of the whole, the greater part of\r\nthe island being intersected by them. In the north-east corner about\r\n40 of them may be counted in half a mile of coast-line, some being of\r\nlarge size. All of them which can be clearly made out are porphyritic\r\nolivine-basalts of the type of the Lion's Haunch at Arthur's Seat.\r\nThey are generally grey in colour and finer at the edges than in the\r\ncentre, which is often coarsely porphyritic and amygdaloidal. Olivine\r\nseems always characteristic, but has often been replaced by hæmatite\r\nor calcite. In Bute a good many dykes have been mapped to the north of\r\nKilchattan Bay resembling this basalt series of Cumbrae, and running in\r\nthe same direction. But they appear to be all porphyritic andesites.\r\nThe second group of dykes, though it cuts the first and is thus\r\nproved to be later in date, is nevertheless confined within the same\r\nstratigraphical limits. It may thus belong nearly to the same period of\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\n\"The dykes of the third group are dolerites without olivine, and\r\nfollow on the whole an east and west direction. They cut both of the\r\ntwo foregoing sets of dykes, and likewise the lavas of the plateau.\r\nThey must thus belong to a far later period of intrusion. They may be\r\nconnected with other dykes and sills on the mainland, which traverse\r\nthe Coal-measures, and would thus be not older than late Carboniferous\r\nor Permian time.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth group of dykes intersects all the others, and is probably\r\nof Tertiary age. The prevalent direction of these dykes in the Cumbraes\r\nis N.N.W.\" The Tertiary dykes are more fully described in Chapters\r\nxxxiv. and xxxv.\r\n\r\nThe great group of tuffs which underlies the lavas of the East Lothian\r\nplateau is traversed by numerous dykes and sills, of which many good\r\nexamples may be seen in the coast-cliffs of North Berwick. Among these\r\nrocks are beautiful olivine-basalts with singularly fresh olivine, as\r\non the shore at North Berwick. Some of them are still more basic, as in\r\nthe case of a limburgite intrusion at the Gin Head, Tantallon Castle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.--Veins and dykes traversing the agglomerate\r\nand tuff of the great Renfrewshire vent.]\r\n\r\n2. In the necks, dykes are sometimes abundant, and they may be observed\r\noccasionally to traverse the surrounding lavas. They consist of similar\r\nmaterials to those found outside the plateaux. Some of the larger necks\r\nare intersected by a network of dykes and veins. The great vent or\r\ngroup of vents among the uplands of Renfrewshire, already described\r\n(Fig. 129), furnishes some admirable examples of this characteristic\r\nvolcanic feature. An illustration from that locality forms the subject\r\nof Fig. 134. The agglomerate which fills the large hollow among the\r\nCampsie Hills may be quoted as another illustration (Fig. 128). Further\r\ninstances will be found in some of the sections given in preceding\r\npages (see Figs. 124, 125, 127). The general aspect of a dyke in the\r\nvolcanic series is shown in Fig. 135.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.--\"The Yellow Man,\" a dyke in volcanic tuff\r\nand conglomerate on the shore a little east of North Berwick.]\r\n\r\nThe Sills associated with the plateau-type of Carboniferous volcanic\r\naction form a less prominent feature than they do among the earlier\r\nPalæozoic formations or in the puy-type which succeeded them. They\r\nconsist in general of short lenticular sheets of andesite or trachyte,\r\nlike the necks and dykes in proximity to which they commonly appear.\r\nThe best area for the study of them is the ground which stretches out\r\nfrom the base of the great escarpments of the Campsie, Kilpatrick\r\nand Ayrshire Hills (Fig. 136), where, among the agglomerate-vents\r\nand abundant dykes, intrusive sheets have likewise been injected\r\nbetween the bedding-planes of the red sandstones. But these sheets\r\nare of comparatively trifling dimensions. Very few of them reach a\r\nmile in length, the great majority falling far short of that size. In\r\nthe Cumbraes and in Bute, Mr. Gunn has observed that the trachytic,\r\nolivine-basalt and dolerite dykes are apt to pass into intrusive\r\nsheets. That the sills, as well as the dykes and bosses of the same\r\nmaterial, are not of older date than the lavas of the plateaux is\r\nproved by the manner in which they pierce these lavas, especially\r\ntowards the bottom of the series. The general absence of basic sills,\r\nwhen we consider how thick a mass of these rocks has sometimes been\r\npoured out in the plateaux, is not a little remarkable. Only in the\r\nbasin of the Firth of Forth do we encounter thick basic sills near the\r\nplateaux, such, for instance, as Salisbury Crags at Edinburgh. But it\r\nis doubtful whether they ought not rather to be classed with the sills\r\nof the puys, to be afterwards described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--Trachytic sills, Knockvadie, Kilpatrick\r\nHills.\r\n\r\n1. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 2. \"Ballagan Beds\"; 3. Tuffs; 4. Lavas of\r\nthe Plateau; 5. Agglomerate of necks; 6. Trachyte sills; 7. Dolerite\r\ndyke (? Tertiary).]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Close of the Plateau-eruptions\r\n\r\nThe relative geological date when the eruptions of each plateau ceased\r\ncan fortunately be determined with much more precision than the time\r\nof their beginning. The Hurlet Limestone, so well known as the lowest\r\nthick calcareous seam in the Carboniferous Limestone series, of which\r\nit is generally taken as the base, can be identified over the whole of\r\nCentral Scotland, and thus forms an excellent stratigraphical horizon,\r\nfrom which the upward termination of the volcanic sheets underneath it\r\ncan be measured.\r\n\r\nWhen the volcanic episode of the plateau-eruptions came to an end, such\r\nbanks or cones as rose above the level of the shallow sea which then\r\noverspread Central Scotland were brought beneath the water, as I have\r\nalready remarked, either by prolonged denudation or more probably in\r\nlarge part by the continued subsidence of the region. The downward\r\nmovement may possibly for a time have been accelerated, especially in\r\nsome districts. Thus the Hurlet Limestone, though usually not more than\r\nfive or six feet thick, increases locally to a much greater thickness.\r\nAt Petersfield, near Bathgate, for example, it is between 70 and 80\r\nfeet in depth, while at Beith, in North Ayrshire, it increases to 100\r\nfeet (Fig. 137), which is the thickest mass of Carboniferous Limestone\r\nknown to exist in Scotland. At both of these localities the limestone\r\nlies upon a series of volcanic rocks, and we may perhaps infer that\r\nthe subsidence advanced there somewhat more rapidly or to a greater\r\nextent, so as to form hollows in which the limestone could gather\r\nto an abnormal depth. The water would appear to have become for a\r\ntime tolerably free from mechanical sediment. The limestone is hence\r\ncomparatively pure, and is extensively quarried all over the country\r\nfor industrial purposes. It is a crinoidal rock, abounding in many\r\nspecies of corals, brachiopods, lamellibranchs, and gasteropods, with\r\ntrilobites, cephalopods, and fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--Section across the edge of the Clyde plateau,\r\nsouth-east of Beith.\r\n\r\n1. Plateau-lavas; 2. Tuffs and volcanic conglomerates; 3. Hurlet\r\nLimestone; 4. Coal-bearing strata above the limestone; 5. Dolerite\r\ndyke.]\r\n\r\nA variable thickness of strata intervenes between the top of the\r\nvolcanic series and the Main Limestone. Sometimes these deposits\r\nconsist in large measure of a mixture of ordinary sandy and muddy\r\nmaterial with the washed-down tuff of the cones, and probably with\r\nvolcanic dust and lapilli thrown out by the latest eruptions. Thus\r\nalong the flank of the hills from Barrhead to Strathavon, yellow\r\nand green ashy sandstones, grits and conglomerates are succeeded by\r\nordinary sandstones, black shales and ironstones, while here and there\r\ntrue volcanic tuff and conglomerate make their appearance.[441] Further\r\nwest, in the Kilbirnie district, the limestone lies directly on the\r\ntuffs that rest upon the andesites (Figs. 137, 138).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: Explanation of Sheet 22, _Geol. Surv. Scotland_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--Section across the upper part of the Clyde\r\nplateau at Kilbirnie, Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n1 1. Plateau-lavas; 2 2. Tuffs; 3 3. Hurlet Limestone; 4. Black-band\r\nIronstone. _f_ _f_. Faults.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most striking contrast between adjacent localities\r\nin regard to the distance between the limestone and the top of the\r\nvolcanic series is to be observed along the southern front of the\r\nCampsie Fells. In spite of the abundant faults which have there so\r\nbroken up the regular sequence of the rocks, we can see that at\r\nBanton and Burnhead the limestone lies almost immediately on the\r\nvolcanic series (Fig. 139). But a little to the westward, sandstones,\r\nconglomerates, shales and thin limestones begin to intervene between\r\nthe volcanic series and the Hurlet Limestone and swell out so rapidly\r\nthat on Craigmaddie Muir and South Hill of Campsie, only some five\r\nmiles off, they must form a total thickness of not less than from 600\r\nto 800 feet of ordinary non-volcanic deposits, chiefly thick pebbly\r\nsandstones (Fig. 140). Such local variations not improbably serve to\r\nindicate hollows on the flanks of the plateaux that were filled up with\r\ndetritus before the depression and clearing of the water that led to\r\nthe deposition of the Hurlet Limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.--Section across the upper surface of the Clyde\r\nvolcanic plateau, Burnhead, north-west of Kilsyth.\r\n\r\n1.

Fault.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--Section across western edge of the Garleton\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\n1. Trachyte lavas of the plateau; 2. Calciferous Sandstones; 3. Hurlet\r\nLimestone.]\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that the eruptions of the plateau period lasted\r\nlonger in the western than in the eastern parts of the region. In the\r\nGarleton district, where the peculiar viscous trachytic lavas probably\r\ngave rise to a more uneven surface or more prominent cones than was\r\nusual among the andesitic plateaux, the eruptions ceased some time\r\nbefore the deposition of the Hurlet Limestone. As the area sank, the\r\nsuccessive zones of the Calciferous Sandstones crept over the flanks\r\nof the trachytes, until at last they had completely buried these rocks\r\nbefore the limestone spread over the area (Fig. 141). In consequence,\r\nprobably, of the uneven surface of this plateau, there is here a strong\r\noverlap of the higher part of the Calciferous Sandstones. On the west\r\nside of the volcanic area there can hardly be more than some 200 feet\r\nof strata between the top of the trachytic series and the limestone,\r\nwhile on the south side there must be greatly more than that thickness.\r\nThis structure probably indicates that the Garleton volcanoes became\r\nextinct after having piled up a mass of tuffs and lavas to such a\r\nheight that its summits were not submerged until the area had subsided\r\n800 or 1000 feet in the waters, over the floor of which the Calciferous\r\nSandstones were laid down. Hence, in spite of the proximity of the\r\nlavas to the limestone, there may have been a vast interval of time\r\nbetween their respective epochs, as has been already suggested with\r\nregard to other plateaux. This subject will be again referred to in\r\ndiscussing the relative chronology of the plateaux and puys.\r\n\r\nIn the Berwickshire and Solway districts, the extinction of the\r\nplateau-vents appears to have taken place at a still earlier part of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, for there the andesites, while they rest on\r\nthe Upper Old Red Sandstone, are covered with at least the higher group\r\nof the Calciferous Sandstones (Fig. 142). The equivalent of the Hurlet\r\nLimestone of Central Scotland must lie many hundred feet above them.\r\n\r\nThe submergence of the plateaux, and their entombment under the\r\nthick Carboniferous Limestone series, did not mark the close of\r\nvolcanic activity in Central Scotland during Carboniferous time. The\r\nplateau-type of eruption ceased and was not repeated, but a new type\r\narose, to which I would now call the reader's attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Section across the Solway plateau from\r\nBirrenswark to Kirtlebridge.\r\n\r\n1.

General Character and Distribution of the Puys; ii. Nature of\r\n     the Materials Erupted--Lavas Ejected at the Surface--Intrusive\r\n     Sheets--Necks and Dykes--Tuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. GENERAL CHARACTER AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the Carboniferous Limestone period, when\r\neruptions of the plateau-type had generally ceased, volcanic activity\r\nshowed itself over the area of the British Isles in a different guise\r\nboth as regards the nature of its products and the manner and scale\r\nof their discharge. Instead of widely extended lava-sheets and tuffs,\r\npiled above each other sometimes to a thickness of many hundred feet,\r\nand stretching over hundreds of square miles, we have now to study the\r\nrecords of another phase of volcanism, where scattered groups and rows\r\nof _Puys_, or small volcanic cones, threw out in most instances merely\r\ntuffs, and these often only in trifling quantity, though here and there\r\ntheir vents also poured forth lavas and gradually piled up volcanic\r\nridges which, in a few cases, almost rivalled some of the plateaux. The\r\nevidence for these less vigorous manifestations of volcanic activity\r\nis furnished (1) by layers of tuff and sheets of basaltic-lavas\r\nintercalated among the strata that were being deposited at the time\r\nof the eruptions, (2) by necks of tuff, agglomerate, or different\r\nlava-form rocks that mark the positions of the orifices of discharge,\r\nand (3) by sills, bosses, and dykes that indicate the subterranean\r\nefforts of the volcanoes. The comparatively small thickness of the\r\naccumulations usually formed by these vents, their extremely local\r\ncharacter, the numerous distinct horizons on which they appear, and\r\nthe intimate way in which they mingle and alternate with the ordinary\r\nCarboniferous strata are features which at once arrest the attention of\r\nthe geologist, presenting, as they do, so striking a contrast to those\r\nof the plateaux.\r\n\r\nFrom the clear intercalation of these volcanic materials on successive\r\nplatforms of the Carboniferous system, the limits of geological\r\ntime within which they were erupted can be fixed with considerable\r\nprecision. It may be said that, in a broad sense, they coincided with\r\nthe period of the Carboniferous Limestone, and certainly it was during\r\nthe deposition of that formation that the eruptions which produced\r\nthem reached their greatest vigour and widest extent. Here and there\r\nin Scotland evidence may be found that the phase of the Puys began\r\nduring that earlier section of Carboniferous time recorded by the\r\nCalciferous Sandstones. This is markedly the case in Liddesdale and\r\nthe neighbouring territory. Over the western part of Midlothian also,\r\nthe eastern portion of West Lothian, and the southern margin of Fife,\r\nabundant traces occur of puy-eruptions during the deposition of the\r\nCalciferous Sandstones. Elsewhere in Central Scotland there is no\r\nevidence of the vents having been opened until after the deposition\r\nof the Hurlet Limestone, which, as we have seen, may conveniently be\r\ntaken as the base of the Scottish Carboniferous Limestone series. The\r\nvolcanoes remained active in West Lothian until near the close of the\r\ntime represented by that series; but in Ayrshire they continued in\r\neruption until the beginning of the accumulation of the Coal-measures.\r\nThese western examples of the puy-type are, so far as I am aware, the\r\nlatest known in Britain.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the earliest puy-eruptions began before the latest\r\nplateau-lavas and tuffs were accumulated is a question that cannot be\r\nreadily answered. It will be remembered that in the basin of the Firth\r\nof Forth a thickness of more than 3000 feet of sedimentary strata,\r\nincluding the Burdiehouse Limestone and numerous oil-shales as well as\r\nthin coal-seams, lies above the red and green marls, shales, sandstones\r\nand cement-stones of the Calciferous Sandstone series. This remarkable\r\nassemblage of strata is absent in the western parts of the country,\r\nwhere the top of the Clyde volcanic plateau is almost immediately\r\noverlain by the Hurlet Limestone. If we were to judge of the sequence\r\nof events merely from the stratigraphy, as expressed in such sections\r\nas Figs. 137, 138, 139 and 140, we might naturally infer that as no\r\ntrace of any break occurs at the top of the Clyde plateau, the tuffs\r\nshading upward there into the limestone series, no important pause in\r\nsedimentation took place, but that the last volcanic eruptions were\r\nsoon succeeded by the conditions that led to the deposition of the\r\nwidespread encrinite-limestones. If this inference were well founded it\r\nwould follow that while the plateau-eruptions in the west lasted till\r\nthe time of the Hurlet Limestone, those in the east ceased long before\r\nthat time and were succeeded by the puys of Fife and the Lothians.\r\nThere would thus be an overlap of the two phases of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe, however, that in spite of the superposition\r\nof the Hurlet Limestone almost immediately upon the volcanic rocks\r\nof the Clyde plateau, and the absence of any trace of a break in the\r\nprocess of sedimentation, a long interval nevertheless elapsed between\r\nthe last eruptions and the deposit of that limestone. The Campsie\r\nsection (Fig. 140) shows us how rapidly a thick mass of strata can come\r\nin along that horizon. The volcanic ridges may have remained partly\r\nunsubmerged for such time as was required for the subsidence of the\r\nForth basin and the deposit of the thick Calciferous Sandstone series\r\nthere, and their summits may only have finally sunk under the sea\r\nnot long before the Hurlet Limestone grew as a continuous floor of\r\ncalcareous material over the whole area of central Scotland. In these\r\ncircumstances, the puy-eruptions of that basin would be long subsequent\r\nto the eruptions of the Clyde plateau, as they certainly were to those\r\nof the plateaux of Midlothian and the Garleton Hills.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the geographical distribution of the puy-eruptions we are\r\nfirst impressed with the force of the evidence for their extremely\r\nlocal and restricted character (Map IV.). Thus in the area of the basin\r\nof the Firth of Forth, which may be regarded as the typical region in\r\nBritain for the study of this form of Carboniferous volcano, traces of\r\nthem are abundant to the west of the line of the Pentland Hills. To\r\nthe east of that line, however, not a vestige of puy-eruptions, save a\r\nfew sills of uncertain relationship, can be detected, though the same\r\nseries of stratigraphical horizons is well developed on both sides\r\nof the Lothian coal-field. Again, to the westward of the Forth basin\r\nover the area of Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire lying to\r\nthe north of the great volcanic plateau, no record of puy-eruptions\r\nhas been noticed. Immediately to the south of that plateau, however,\r\nthese eruptions were numerous in the north of Ayrshire. Yet the rest of\r\nthe Carboniferous area in that large county has supplied no relics of\r\nthese eruptions save at one locality--the Heads of Ayr. Lastly, while\r\nno trace of any younger display of volcanic activity occurs in the\r\nMerse of Berwickshire, east of the plateau series of that district, the\r\nground immediately to the west abounds in puys, and contains likewise\r\nextensive sheets of tuff and beds of basic lavas connected with these\r\nvents.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which at once attracts notice in Scotland is the way in\r\nwhich the puy-vents have generally avoided the areas of the plateaux,\r\nthough they sometimes approach them closely. As a rule, it is possible\r\nto distinguish the tuffs and agglomerates which have filled up these\r\nvents from those that mark the sites of the eruptive orifices of the\r\nplateaux. There are, no doubt, some instances, as in Liddesdale, where\r\npuys have appeared on the sites of the older lavas, but these are\r\nexceptional collocations.[442] On the other hand, many examples may be\r\nfound where puys have risen in the interspace between the limits of\r\nthe eruptions of two plateau-areas. Thus the tract between the Clyde\r\nplateau-eruptions on the west and those of the Garleton Hills on the\r\neast was dotted over with puys. Again, the southern margin of the Clyde\r\nplateau in Ayrshire, from Dalry to Galston is flanked with puys and\r\nlong sheets of their lavas and tuffs.[443]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: A means of definitely placing some of these vents in the\r\nseries of puy-eruptions is stated further on, at p. 476.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: Reference may again be made here to the remarkable\r\nsimilarity between the Scottish Carboniferous puy-vents and those of\r\nolder Tertiary time in the Swabian Alps so fully described by Professor\r\nBranco in the work already cited p. 46. Denudation in that region has\r\nbared the cones and exposed the structure of the necks which, down to\r\neven minute details, repeat the phenomena of Carboniferous and Permian\r\ntime in Scotland.]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. NATURE OF THE MATERIALS ERUPTED\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The Lava-form Rocks\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the nature of the materials erupted by the\r\nvolcanic activity of the puys. The geologist who passes from the\r\nstudy of the plateau lavas to those of the puys at once remarks the\r\nprevalent more basic character of the latter. The great majority of\r\nthem are basalts, generally olivine-bearing, in the various types\r\nembraced in the table on the following page. The olivine-free dolerites\r\nare generally found as intrusive bosses, sills and dykes. Such more\r\nacid rocks as andesites occur only rarely, and still more seldom are\r\nquartziferous masses met with in some of the bosses.\r\n\r\nDolerites and Basalts.--The great majority of the lava-form rocks\r\nconnected with the puys are basic in composition, and belong to\r\nthe family of the Dolerites and Basalts. They graduate, on the one\r\nhand, into ultra-basic rocks such as limburgite and picrite, and on\r\nthe other, into compounds that approach andesites or trachytes in\r\ncomposition. A large series of specimens from Central Scotland was\r\nstudied a few years ago by Dr. Hatch, who proposed a petrographical\r\nclassification of the rocks, and arranged them in a number of types\r\nwhich he named after localities where they are well developed.[444]\r\nMore recently the rocks have again been subjected to microscopic\r\ninvestigation by my colleague Mr. Watts, who, confirming generally Dr.\r\nHatch's discriminations, has made some modifications of them. He has\r\nfurnished me with a revised classification (p. 418), based on purely\r\npetrographical considerations. The doleritic and basaltic series\r\nmay be grouped into two divisions, one with, and the other without,\r\nolivine, and each division may be further separated into a dolerite\r\ngroup, which presents an ophitic or sub-ophitic structure, and a\r\nbasalt-group in which the groundmass is made up of felspar and granular\r\naugite, and possesses the \"intersertal structure\" of Rosenbusch, or\r\nconsists of idiomorphic augite embedded in felspar substance. The term\r\n\"sub-ophitic\" is employed by Mr. Watts \"to imply that the augite grains\r\nare neither very large nor very continuous, optically, and that they\r\nrarely contain entire felspar-crystals imbedded in them, merely the\r\nends of a group of these crystals as a rule penetrating into them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: This classification was given in my Presidential Address\r\nto the Geological Society, 1892, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlviii. p. 129. See Report of Geological Survey for 1896.]\r\n\r\nTransitional forms occur between many of the following types by the\r\nincrease or diminution in the relative proportions of the constituents.\r\nThus it is not easy to draw a line between 2_b_ and 2_c_; the latter\r\nagain shades into 2_d_ and 2_e_ by the decrease of the felspar.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts has further observed that the rocks containing no olivine\r\noffer greater difficulties in classification than those in which that\r\nmineral is present. \"The very distinction,\" he remarks, \"between\r\ndolerites and basalts is less marked, the types are much less sharply\r\ndistinguished, and decomposition and masking of the structure are\r\nmore common. While using the term Dolerite for such rocks as have a\r\nsub-ophitic structure, I have extended it to those rocks in which\r\nevidence exists that a great part of the crystallization took place\r\nunder intratelluric conditions. Although not quite holocrystalline,\r\nthe crystals of felspar, augite and magnetite are large and the\r\nstructure coarse-grained, while the groundmass is confined to\r\ncomparatively small interstitial patches. In these rocks there is\r\nusually no one dominant porphyritic ingredient.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                     I.

This is the quarry near Blackburn, to the east of\r\nBathgate, where I originally observed it.[445] The rock occurs there\r\non the line of the basalt-flows from the Bathgate Hills, and I mapped\r\nit as one of them before the microscope revealed the remarkable\r\ncomposition of the mass. I still believe it to be a lava like the\r\n\"leckstone\" described on p. 443, though the other known examples of\r\nthis rock in the basin of the Firth of Forth are intrusive sheets.\r\nThe rock locally known as \"leckstone\" or \"lakestone\" has long been\r\nquarried for the purpose of constructing the soles of bakers' ovens, as\r\nit stands a considerable temperature without cracking. Its microscopic\r\nstructure is now well known. As exposed in Blackburn quarry, an\r\ninteresting difference is observable between the lower and upper\r\nparts of the sheet. The lower portion is a picrite, with abundant\r\nserpentinized olivine, large crystals of augite, and a considerable\r\namount of ores. The upper portion, on the other hand, has plagioclase\r\nas its most abundant definite mineral, with a minor quantity of minute\r\nprisms of augite and of iron-ores, and scattered crystals of olivine.\r\nHere, within the compass of a few yards and in one continuous mass of\r\nrock, we have a transition from a variety of olivine-basalt into a\r\npicrite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxix. (1879) p. 506.]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the puy lavas belong to the olivine-bearing\r\nseries. A few of them are dolerites, but most are true basalts of the\r\nDalmeny type, of which typical examples may be seen at the Kirkton\r\nquarries, Bathgate, and in the coast section between Pettycur and\r\nKinghorn. Occasionally they present transitions towards picrite, as in\r\nthe sheet overlying the lowest limestone at Kirkton, and in the lowest\r\nlava of King Alexander's Crag, Burntisland. These puy lavas exhibit\r\nconsiderable variety of structure as seen in the field. Some are\r\nsolid, compact, black rocks, not infrequently columnar and weathering\r\ninto spheroidal exfoliating forms. Others are somewhat granular in\r\ntexture, acquiring green and brown tints by weathering, often showing\r\namygdaloidal kernels, and even passing into well-marked amygdaloids.\r\nMany of them exhibit a slaggy structure at their upper and under\r\nsurfaces (Figs. 153, 170, 171). These external differences are an\r\nindex to the corresponding variations in composition and microscopic\r\nstructure enumerated in the foregoing tabular arrangement.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the basic rocks which occur intrusively in connection\r\nwith the puys, especially where they form a considerable mass, have\r\nassumed a much more coarsely crystalline texture than those of\r\nsimilar composition which have been poured out at the surface. They\r\nare generally dolerites rather than basalts. But with this obvious\r\ndistinction, the two groups have so much in common, that the geologist\r\nwho passes from the study of the subterranean phenomena of the Plateaux\r\nto that of the corresponding phenomena of the Puys is at once impressed\r\nwith the close relationship between the material which, in the case\r\nof the puys, has consolidated above ground, and that which has been\r\ninjected below. There is no such contrast between them, for example, as\r\nthat between the basic and intermediate lavas of the plateaux and the\r\nmore acid intrusions associated with them.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest number of the basic sills, bosses and dykes\r\nassociated with the puys are somewhat coarsely crystalline dolerites\r\nwithout olivine. They include, however, olivine-dolerites and basalts,\r\nand even some extremely basic compounds. Of these last, a typical\r\nexample is supplied by the now well-known picrite of Inchcolm, in\r\nthe Firth of Forth, which occurs as an intrusive sheet among the\r\nLower Carboniferous Sandstones.[446] In recent years one or two other\r\npicrite-sills have been observed in the same district. An interesting\r\nexample has been described from a railway cutting between Edinburgh\r\nand Cramond where the rock invades and alters shales. More detailed\r\nreference to it will be made in the account of the sills connected\r\nwith the puys. Another instance of the occurrence of this rock is in\r\na railway cutting immediately to the west of Burntisland where it has\r\nbeen intruded among the Calciferous Sandstones below the Burdiehouse\r\nLimestone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxix. (1879) p. 506.\r\nTeall, _British Petrography_, p. 94.]\r\n\r\nRocks approaching limburgite occur among the sills and bosses which\r\npierce the Carboniferous Limestone series of Fife between Cowdenbeath\r\nand Inverkeithing. One of these is found at Pitandrew, near Fordel\r\nCastle. Dr. Hatch observed that it consists of \"numerous porphyritic\r\ncrystals of olivine, with a few grains of augite and an occasional\r\nsmall lath-shaped crystal of felspar imbedded in a groundmass which is\r\ncomposed principally of idiomorphic augite microlites, small crystals\r\nof a brown mica, granules of magnetite and prisms of apatite. In\r\naddition, there is a considerable amount of interstitial matter, which\r\nis partly colourless glass, and partly shows a slight reaction between\r\ncrossed nicols.\" Another example of the same type of rock occurs as\r\na plug or boss in the tuff-vent of the Hill of Beath, and a further\r\ndisplay of the limburgite type is to be seen in Dunearn Hill near\r\nBurntisland.\r\n\r\nAlthough olivine-basalts of the Dalmeny type are most frequently met\r\nwith as interstratified lavas, they also occur as bosses and sills. The\r\ntypical example from Dalmeny is itself intrusive. Other illustrations\r\nare to be found in the Castle Rock of Edinburgh and in the sheets near\r\nCrossgates and Blairadam in Fife. The presence or absence of olivine,\r\nhowever, may sometimes be a mere accident of cooling or otherwise.\r\nI have shown that in the same mass of rock at Blackburn a gradation\r\ncan be traced from a rock largely composed of altered olivine into\r\none consisting mainly of felspar with but little olivine, and another\r\nexample occurs in the picrite-sill between Edinburgh and Cramond. Dr.\r\nStecher has ascertained that the marginal portions of the sills in\r\nthe basin of the Firth of Forth, which cooled first and rapidly, and\r\nmay be taken, therefore, to indicate the mineral composition of the\r\nrock at the time of extrusion, are often rich in olivine, while that\r\nmineral may be hardly or not at all discernible in the main body of the\r\nrock.[447]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: Dr. Stecher, _Tschermak's Mineralog. Mittheil._ vol. ix.\r\n(1887) p. 193. _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xv. (1888) p. 162.]\r\n\r\nOf the ordinary and characteristic dolerites without olivine which\r\nconstitute most of the intrusive masses, the various types enumerated\r\nin the tabular arrangement are abundantly developed in Central\r\nScotland. Thus the normal ophitic type is displayed by the uppermost\r\nsill of the Burntisland series, and by the rock which forms the plug\r\nof the Binns Hill neck in Linlithgowshire. The Ratho type is well\r\nseen in the large sill at Ratho, likewise in the extensive intrusive\r\nsheets in the west of Linlithgowshire as at Muckraw and Carribber. The\r\nBurntisland sill type is shown by the lower sills of Burntisland and\r\nby some others in the same region, especially by that of Colinswell,\r\nand by another on the shore east from the Poorhouse, near Kinghorn. The\r\ngreat boss among the Bathgate Hills likewise displays it. The Bowden\r\nHill type occurs in well-marked development at Bowden Hill, three miles\r\nsouth-west of Linlithgow, and in the massive sill at St. Margaret's,\r\nwest from North Queensferry.\r\n\r\nThe non-olivine-bearing basalts are found in various bosses and sheets\r\nin the basin of the Firth of Forth. Thus the Binny Craig type occurs\r\nin the prominent and picturesque sill from which it is named, likewise\r\namong the intrusive sheets near Kirkcaldy, in Fife. Sometimes the same\r\nmass of rock displays more than one type of structure, as in the case\r\nof the great Galabraes neck among the Bathgate Hills wherein both the\r\nTholeiite and Burntisland sill types may be recognized.\r\n\r\nSome of the sills in West Lothian, as I pointed out many years ago,\r\ncontain bitumen and give off a bituminous odour when freshly broken.\r\nThey have been injected into bituminous shales or coal-seams.[448]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _Geol. Survey Memoir on Geology of Edinburgh_ (Sheet 32,\r\nScotland), p. 46.]\r\n\r\n2. Andesites.--Rocks referable to this series appear to have been of\r\nrare occurrence among the puy-eruptions. Examples of them containing\r\nas much as 60 per cent of silica occur among the lavas of the Limerick\r\nbasin. Some of the necks and what may be sills in the same district\r\nlikewise consist of them.\r\n\r\n3. Trachytes and Quartz-bearing Rocks.--Acid rocks, as I have already\r\nsaid, are extremely rare among the puy-eruptions. The only important\r\nexamples known to me are those around the Limerick basin, where they\r\nrise apparently in old vents and form conspicuous rounded or conical\r\nhills. These rocks have been examined microscopically by Mr. W. W.\r\nWatts. One of the most interesting varieties, which occurs at the\r\nStanding Stone near Oola, was found by him to show quartz enclosing\r\nophitically the felspars which, with well-terminated prisms, project\r\ninto it. Further west, near Knockaunavoher, another boss occurs with\r\nconspicuous quartz. These rocks have much in common with trachytes but\r\nhave a wholly crystalline structure. They will be described in the\r\naccount of the Limerick basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Tuffs\r\n\r\nThe fragmental rocks connected with the puy-eruptions form a\r\nwell-marked group, easily distinguishable, for the most part, from the\r\ntuffs of the plateaux. They vary from exceedingly fine compacted dust\r\nor volcanic mud, through various stages of increasing coarseness of\r\ntexture, to basalt-conglomerates and tumultuous agglomerates.\r\n\r\nThe fragmentary material found in the necks of the puys is generally\r\nan agglomerate of a dull dirty-green colour. The matrix ranges from\r\na fine compact volcanic mud to a thoroughly granular detritus, and\r\nsometimes shows a spheroidal concentric structure in weathering. In\r\nthis matrix the lapilli are distributed with great irregularity and in\r\nconstantly varying proportions. They consist in large measure of a pale\r\nyellowish-green, sometimes pale grey, very basic, finely vesicular,\r\ndevitrified glass, which is generally much decomposed and cuts easily\r\nwith the knife. This highly basic substance is a kind of palagonite.\r\nSo minute are its vesicles that under the microscope a thin slice may\r\npresent a delicate lace-like network of connected walls, the palagonite\r\noccupying much less space than the vesicles. The material has been a\r\nfinely frothed-up pumice.\r\n\r\nBesides this generally distributed basic pumice, the stones in the\r\nagglomerate of the necks likewise include fragments of older volcanic\r\ngrits or tuffs, blocks of basalt or diabase, as well as pieces of the\r\nCarboniferous strata of the district, especially shale, sandstone and\r\nlimestone. Not infrequently also, they comprise angular blocks of\r\nfossil wood.\r\n\r\nThe materials which fill the necks are generally much coarser than\r\nthose that form intercalated beds. But while in numerous cases huge\r\nblocks of basalt and large masses of sandstone, shale, limestone,\r\nironstone or other strata may be seen wrapped up in a matrix of\r\ncoarse basalt-tuff, in not a few instances the material in the\r\nnecks may be observed to consist of a tuff quite as fine as that of\r\nthe interstratified bands. Such necks appear to mark the sites of\r\ntuff-cones where only fine ashes and lapilli were ejected, and where,\r\nafter sometimes a brief and feeble period of activity, the orifice\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\nThe bedded tuffs interstratified with the ordinary Carboniferous\r\nstrata do not essentially differ in composition from the material of\r\nthe necks. They are basalt- (diabase-) tuffs and basalt- (diabase-)\r\nconglomerates, usually dull green in colour and granular in texture,\r\nthe lapilli consisting in great measure of various more or less\r\ndecayed basalts, but containing the same highly vesicular basic glass\r\nor pumice above referred to. They are mainly to be distinguished\r\nby their conspicuous stratification, and especially by their rapid\r\nalternations of coarser and finer material, by the intercalation of\r\nshales, limestones, sandstones or ironstones in them, and by the\r\ninsensible gradations by which they pass both vertically and laterally\r\ninto ordinary sediments. Occasional large blocks or bombs, indicating\r\nsome paroxysm of explosion, may be observed even among the finer tuffs,\r\nshales and other strata, which round the sides of these masses have had\r\ntheir layers bent down by the fall of heavy blocks.[449] Many of the\r\nbedded tuffs contain fossils, such as crinoids, corals, brachiopods,\r\nfish-teeth or macerated fragments of land-plants. Coal-seams also are\r\noccasionally interstratified among them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: _Ante_, p. 36, and Figs. 15 and 151. See also _Geol.\r\nMag._ i. (1864), p. 22; _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxix. (1879) p.\r\n515.]\r\n\r\nOf the finer kinds, the best example is furnished by a remarkable\r\ngroup of \"green and red marls\" which lie above a seam of coal (Houston\r\nCoal) in the Calciferous Sandstones of West Lothian.[450] These\r\nstrata, which differ much from any of the rocks with which they are\r\nassociated, are exceedingly fine in grain, dull sage-green and brownish\r\nor chocolate-red in colour, not well laminated like the shales, but\r\nbreaking under the influence of weathering into angular fragments,\r\nsometimes with a conchoidal fracture. They look like indurated mud. Mr.\r\nH. M. Cadell, who has recently re-examined them in connection with a\r\nrevision of the Geological Survey Map (Sheet 32) has found them passing\r\ninto ordinary granular tuff.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: Memoir on Sheet 32 _Geol. Surv. Scotland_ (1861), p.\r\n42. The stratigraphical position of these \"Houston Marls,\" as they are\r\nlocally called, is indicated in Fig. 155.]\r\n\r\nPalagonitic-tuff is of frequent occurrence. It is met with in the\r\nFirth of Forth district,[451] and Mr. Watts has detected fragments of\r\npalagonite among the tuffs of the Limerick basin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: _Trans. Roy. Soc.

Vents: Relation of the Necks to the Rocks through which they\r\n     rise--Evidence of the probable Subærial Character of some of\r\n     the Cones or Puys of Tuff--Entombment of the Volcanic Cones and\r\n     their Relation to the Superficial Ejections. 2. Bedded Tuffs and\r\n     Lavas--Effects of Subsequent Dislocations. 3. Sills, Bosses and\r\n     Dykes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe puy-type of volcanic hill differs widely in one respect from\r\nthose which we have hitherto been considering. In the earlier epochs\r\nof volcanism within the British area, it is the masses of material\r\ndischarged from the vent, rather than the vents themselves which arrest\r\nattention. Indeed, so copiously have these masses been erupted that the\r\nvents are often buried, or their positions have been rendered doubtful,\r\nby the uprise in and around them of sills and bosses of molten rock.\r\nBut among the Carboniferous puys the vent is often the only record\r\nthat remains of the volcanic activity. In some cases we know that it\r\nnever ejected any igneous material to the surface. In others, though\r\nit may be filled with volcanic agglomerate or tuff, there is no record\r\nof any shower of such detritus having been discharged from it. In yet\r\na third class of examples, we see that lava rose in the vent, but no\r\nevidence remains as to whether or not it ever flowed out above ground.\r\nOther cases occur where beds of lava or of tuff, or of both together,\r\nhave been intercalated in a group of strata, but with no trace now\r\nvisible of the vent from which they came. The most complete chronicle,\r\npreserving at once a record of the outflow of lava, of the showering\r\nforth of ashes and bombs, and of the necks that mark the vents of\r\neruption, is only to be found in some of the districts.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore, in the present instance, reverse the order of\r\narrangement followed in the previous chapters, and treat first of the\r\nvents, then of the materials emitted from them, and lastly of the sills\r\nand dykes.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. VENTS\r\n\r\nA large number of vents rise through the Carboniferous rocks of\r\nScotland. Some of these are not associated with any interbedded\r\nvolcanic material, so that their geological age cannot be more\r\nprecisely defined than by saying that they must be later than the\r\nparticular formations which they pierce. Some of them, as I shall\r\nendeavour to show, are in all probability of Permian age. But many,\r\nfrom their position with reference to the nearest intercalated lavas\r\nand tuffs, are to be regarded as almost certainly belonging to the\r\nCarboniferous period. Those which are immediately surrounded by sheets\r\nof lava and tuff, similar in character to the materials in the vents\r\nthemselves, may without hesitation be connected with these sheets as\r\nmarking the orifices of discharge.\r\n\r\nThe vents of the puys are in general much less than those of the\r\nplateaux. Their smallest examples measure only a few yards in diameter,\r\ntheir largest seldom much exceed half a mile.[452]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: The following measurements of necks belonging to the\r\npuy-eruptions in different parts of Scotland are taken from the 6-inch\r\nfield-maps of the Geological Survey:--Saline Hill, Fife, 6000 × 4000\r\nfeet; Binn of Burntisland, 3500 × 1500; Hill of Beath, Fife, 2900 ×\r\n1550; Binns Hill, Linlithgowshire, 4800 × 2200; Tor Hill, Ecclesmachan,\r\nLinlithgowshire, 1900 × 1000 (Fig. 155); Great Moor, near Maiden Pap,\r\nRoxburghshire, 2600 × 2400; Tinnis Hill, Liddesdale, 1500 × 1000; Roan\r\nFell, Liddesdale, 300 × 200; Hadsgarth Burn, Liddesdale, 250 × 200;\r\nDalbate Burn, 250 × 120. In some cases, especially in those of the\r\nlarger necks, it is probable that the tuff belongs to more than one\r\nfunnel. Thus the Binn of Burntisland almost certainly includes two\r\nnecks, a smaller one to the west and a much larger one to the east.\r\nSaline Hill may also conceal more than one vent. But in the continuous\r\nmass of tuff at the surface it is at present impossible to determine\r\nprecisely the number and boundaries of the several orifices.]\r\n\r\nThe dislocations of the Carboniferous system are probably on the whole\r\nlater than its volcanic phenomena. It is at least certain that the\r\nlavas and tuffs of the puys have been extensively faulted, like the\r\nsurrounding sedimentary strata, and the vents seldom show any apparent\r\nrelation to faults. It may sometimes be observed, however, that the\r\nvents are arranged in lines suggestive of fissures underneath. A\r\nremarkable instance of the linear distribution is furnished by the\r\nchain of necks which extends from the Vale of the Tweed at Melrose\r\nsouth-westwards across the watershed and down Liddesdale. The most\r\nnotable part of this line lies among the uplands to the east of the\r\nOld Mosspaul Inn at the head of the Ewes Water. A string of masses\r\nof agglomerate has there solidified in a fissure among the Silurian\r\ngreywackes and shales, running in a north-easterly direction for\r\nseveral miles. The largest connected mass of agglomerate is 4700 feet\r\nlong, and from 350 to 600 feet broad (see No. 1 in Fig. 22). That\r\nthis curious vent, or connected line of vents along a great fissure,\r\nbelongs to the puy-eruptions of Liddesdale is shown by the abundant\r\nfragments of yellow sandstone and cement-stone which occur in the\r\nagglomerate.[453]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: These facts were ascertained by Mr. Peach in mapping the\r\nground for the Geological Survey. See Sheet 17, Scotland.]\r\n\r\nMost frequently the vents are distributed irregularly in groups. As\r\nexamples of this arrangement I may cite those of the west of Fife, of\r\nWest Lothian and of the north of Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nA convenient classification of the vents may be made by dividing them\r\ninto four groups according to the nature of the material that now\r\nfills them: 1st, Necks of non-volcanic debris; 2nd, Necks of tuff and\r\nagglomerate; 3rd, Necks of similar materials, but with a central plug\r\nof basalt; 4th, Bosses of basalt or other lava, without agglomerate or\r\ntuff.\r\n\r\n1. _Necks of Non-volcanic Debris._--In a few instances the orifices\r\nof eruption have been filled up entirely with non-volcanic debris.\r\nThey have served as funnels for the discharge of explosive vapours\r\nonly, without the expulsion of any solid volcanic materials. At\r\nleast no trace of fragmentary lavas is met with in them, nor are\r\nany beds of tuff or lava intercalated among the surrounding strata.\r\nSome interesting examples of this kind were laid bare in the open\r\nironstone-workings near Carluke in Lanarkshire. They were circular in\r\nground-plan, descended vertically into the strata, and were somewhat\r\nwider at the top of the quarry than at the bottom. They were filled\r\nwith angular pieces of Carboniferous sandstone, shale, limestone,\r\nironstone and other rocks, these materials being rudely arranged with\r\na dip towards the centre of the neck, where the blocks were largest\r\nin size. Though no fragments of igneous rocks were observed among the\r\ndebris, a few string-like veins of \"white trap,\" or altered basalt,\r\nwere seen to traverse the agglomerate here and there. The necks and\r\nthe strata surrounding them were highly impregnated with pyrites and\r\nsulphate of lime.[454]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: Prof. Jas. Geikie, _Mem. Geol. Surv. Scotland_,\r\nExplanation of Sheet 23, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--Section of volcanic vent at East Grange,\r\nPerthshire coal-field, constructed by Mr. B. N. Peach from the rocks\r\nexposed in a railway-cutting, and from plans of ironstone- and\r\ncoal-pits.\r\n\r\n1. Three feet coal; 2. Ontake coal; 3. Upper and Lower Black-band\r\nIronstones; 4. Index Limestone; 5. Gas Coal and Janet Peat Coal; 6.\r\nCalmy Limestone; 7. Neck.]\r\n\r\nA vent of the same nature, but on a much larger scale, has been mapped\r\nby Mr. Peach in the south of Perthshire, near East Grange, where\r\nit rises through the higher coal-bearing part of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series (Fig. 143). It has been encountered in the mining\r\nof coal and ironstone, and its cross-section has been ascertained in\r\nthe underground workings which have been carried up to its margin. It\r\nmeasures 1500 feet in diameter from east to west and 2000 feet from\r\nnorth to south. It does not appear ever to have emitted any ashes\r\nor lava. Mr. Peach found it filled with dark sandy crumbling clays,\r\nfull of fragments of sandstone, shale and coal. These sediments are\r\narranged in layers that dip in the same general direction as the strata\r\nsurrounding the vent. They contain abundant calcareous nodules of all\r\nsizes from that of a hazel-nut up to concretions 18 feet in diameter.\r\nThe clays likewise include many of the common shells and crinoids of\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone sea, and the same fossils are enclosed in\r\nthe nodules. A remarkable feature in this vent is the occurrence of\r\nabundant vertical rents, which have been filled partly with the same\r\nmaterial that forms the nodules, and partly with sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the neck took place after the deposition of the Index\r\nLimestone, and probably about the time of the accumulation of the next\r\nlimestone, which lies immediately to the west somewhat higher in the\r\nseries. It would appear that the eruption which produced this funnel\r\ngave forth only gaseous explosions, and occurred on the sea-floor;\r\nthat the low crater-walls were washed down to such an extent that the\r\nsea entered and carried some of its characteristic organisms into the\r\nlagoon or _maar_ within; further, that as the silt gathered inside,\r\nsuccessive subsidences occurred, whereby the sediment was rent by\r\ncracks into which sand and calcareous mud were washed from above.[455]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: The vent is shown in Sheet 39, _Geol. Surv. Scotland_.]\r\n\r\nMany necks occur wherein non-volcanic materials, though not forming\r\nthe whole of the agglomerate, make up by far the larger part, with\r\nonly a slight admixture of volcanic tuff between them. Among the\r\nBurntisland necks of Fife, for instance, abundant fragments of the\r\nwell-marked cyprid limestone and shale may be observed, while at Niddry\r\nin Linlithgowshire blocks several yards in length, and consisting of\r\ndifferent layers of shale and cement-stone still adhering to each\r\nother, may be seen imbedded at all angles in the tuff.\r\n\r\nWhere only the debris of non-volcanic rocks occupies a vent, we may\r\ninfer that the volcanic action was limited to the explosion of steam,\r\nwhereby the rocks were dislocated, and an orifice communicating with\r\nthe surface was drilled through them, and that while no true volcanic\r\nrock in such a case appeared, the pipe was filled up to perhaps not\r\nfar from the surface by the falling back of the shattered detritus. A\r\nlittle greater intensity or farther prolongation of the volcanic action\r\nwould bring the column of lava up the funnel, and allow its upper part\r\nto be blown out as dust and lapilli; while still more vigorous activity\r\nwould be marked by the rise of the lava into rents of the cone or\r\nits actual outflow at the surface. Every gradation in this scale of\r\nprogress may be detected among the Carboniferous volcanoes of the basin\r\nof the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\n2. _Necks of Tuff and Agglomerate._--The majority of the necks\r\nconnected with the puys consist of tuff or agglomerate. Externally they\r\ngenerally appear as smooth rounded grassy hills that rise disconnected\r\nfrom other eminences. In some districts their materials consist of\r\na greenish granular often stratified tuff, enclosing rounded balls\r\nof various basic lavas and pieces of sandstone, shale, limestone or\r\nother strata through which they have been drilled. This is their usual\r\ncharacter in the Forth region. But in some cases, the tuff becomes a\r\ncoarse agglomerate, made up partly of large blocks of basalt and other\r\nvolcanic rocks and partly of the sedimentary strata around them, of\r\nwhich large masses, many cubic yards in bulk, may be seen. Among the\r\nenclosed fragments it is not unusual to find pieces of older stratified\r\ntuff. These resemble in general petrographical character parts of the\r\ntuff among which they are imbedded. Sometimes they have been\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--View of the Binn of Burntisland--a volcanic\r\nneck of agglomerate. (This illustration and Figs. 145, 152, 153,\r\n164, 166 and 168 are from photographs taken by Mr. Robert Lunn\r\nfor the Geological Survey.)] derived from previous tuffs which,\r\ninterstratified among the sedimentary strata, had been broken up by\r\nthe opening of a new vent. But probably in most cases they should be\r\nregarded as portions of the volcanic debris which, having solidified\r\ninside the crater, was blown out in fragments by subsequent explosions.\r\nIn a modern volcano a considerable amount of stratified tuff may be\r\nformed inside the crater. The ashes and stones thrown out during a\r\nperiod of activity fall not only on the outer slopes of the cone,\r\nbut on the steep inner declivities of the crater, where they arrange\r\nthemselves in beds that dip at high angles towards the crater\r\nbottom. This feature is well seen in some of the extinct cones in\r\nthe Neapolitan district. In some of the Scottish puys the tuff is\r\nstratified and has tumbled down into a highly inclined or vertical\r\nposition (Fig. 145).\r\n\r\nAs a good illustration of the variety and relative proportions of the\r\nejected blocks in the green tuff of the puy-vents, I may cite the\r\nfollowing table of percentages which I took many years ago in the tuff\r\nwhich rises through the Cement-stone group on the beach at the Heads of\r\nAyr.\r\n\r\n  Diabase and basalt                          57 per cent.\r\n  Older tuff                                   3    \"\r\n  Andesite (probably from Old Red Sandstone\r\n    volcanic series of the neighbourhood)     14    \"\r\n  Limestone (cement-stone, etc.)              20    \"\r\n  Shale                                        3    \"\r\n  Sandstone                                    2    \"\r\n  Fossil wood                                  1    \"\r\n                                            ----\r\n                                             100\r\n\r\nWhile many examples might be cited where no molten rock of any kind has\r\nrisen in the vents, or where at least all the visible materials are of\r\na fragmentary character, yet small veins and dykes of basalt have not\r\ninfrequently been injected into the tuff or agglomerate. These seldom\r\nrun far, and usually present a more or less tortuous course. Thus, on\r\nthe south front of the Binn of Burntisland (Figs. 166, 168) a number of\r\nbasalt-dykes, which vary in breadth from five or six feet to scarcely\r\nso many inches, bifurcate and rapidly disappear in the tuff, one of\r\nthem ascending tortuously to near the top of the cliff. They at once\r\nrecall the appearance of the well-known dykes in the great crater wall\r\nof Somma.\r\n\r\nThough not by any means the largest or most perfect of the vents in the\r\nbasin of the Firth of Forth, the Binn of Burntisland, of which a view\r\nis given in Fig. 144, may be cited in illustration of their general\r\ncharacters. It presents in detail some of the most strikingly volcanic\r\naspects of scenery anywhere to be seen in that region. Consisting of a\r\ndull green granular volcanic tuff, it rises abruptly out of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous formations to a height of 631 feet above the sea. The\r\nsouthern edge of this neck has been so extensively denuded, that it\r\npresents steep craggy slopes and rugged precipices, which descend from\r\nthe very summit of the cone to the plain below--a vertical distance of\r\nnearly 500 feet. Here and there the action of atmospheric waste has\r\nhollowed out huge crater-like chasms in the crumbling tuff. Standing\r\nin one of these, the geologist can realize what must have been the\r\naspect of the interior of these ancient Carboniferous volcanic cones.\r\nThe scene at once reminds him of the crater-walls of a modern or not\r\nlong extinct volcano. The dull-green rudely stratified tuff rises\r\naround in verdureless crumbling sheets of naked rock, roughened by the\r\ninnumerable blocks of lava, which form so conspicuous an element in\r\nthe composition of the mass. The ribs or veins of columnar basalt run\r\nup the declivities as black shattered walls. The frosts and rains of\r\nmany centuries have restored to the tuff its original loose gravelly\r\ncharacter. It disintegrates rapidly, and rolls down the slopes in long\r\ngrey lines of volcanic sand, precisely as it no doubt did at the time\r\nof its ejection, when it fell on the outer and inner declivities of\r\nthe original cone. Some of these features may be partly realized from\r\nFig. 145, which represents a portion of the south front of the hill.\r\nSections of this neck are given in Figs. 149 and 159.\r\n\r\n(3) _Necks of Tuff or Agglomerate with a Central Plug of Basalt or\r\nother Lava._--It has often happened that, after the explosions in a\r\nvent have begun to decrease in vigour, or have at last ceased, lava\r\nhas risen in the chimney and finally sealed it up. In such cases the\r\nmain mass of the rock may consist of tuff or agglomerate, which the\r\nenfeebled volcanic activity has been unable to expel from the orifice,\r\nwhile a plug of basalt, dolerite, or even more basic material, of much\r\nsmaller dimensions, may have risen up the pipe in the centre or towards\r\none side. Binns Hill, West Lothian, the Beath and Saline Hills of Fife,\r\nand Tinnis Hill in Liddesdale are good examples of this structure. (See\r\nFigs. 26, 148, 149 and 174).\r\n\r\n(4) _Necks of Basalt, Dolerite, etc._--In other cases no fragmental\r\nmaterial is present in the vent, or possibly traces of it may be seen\r\nhere and there adhering to the walls of the funnel, the prevailing rock\r\nbeing some form of lava. Necks of this kind are much less frequent\r\nin the puy- than in the plateau-type. But examples may be found in\r\nseveral districts. The most striking with which I am acquainted are\r\nthose which form so picturesque a group of isolated cones around the\r\nvolcanic basin of Limerick, to be afterwards described (Figs. 195,\r\n196). The vents there have been filled by the uprise of much more acid\r\nrocks than the lavas of the basin, for, as I have already stated, they\r\ninclude even quartziferous trachytes. In the basin of the Firth of\r\nForth some prominent bosses of basalt probably mark the sites of former\r\nvents, such as Dunearn Hill in Fife, the Castle Rock of Edinburgh, and\r\nGalabraes Hill near Bathgate. Some striking vents which occur in the\r\nJedburgh district, in the debateable land between the plateau series\r\non the east and the puy-series on the west, show the nearly complete\r\nusurpation of the funnel by basalt, but with portions of the tuff still\r\nremaining visible.\r\n\r\n_Relation of the Necks to the Rocks through which they rise._--A\r\nremarkable feature among the Carboniferous and Permian vents of central\r\nScotland is presented by the effect which has been produced on the\r\nstrata immediately surrounding them. In the interior of the country\r\nthis effect is often\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--View of part of the cliffs of vertical\r\nagglomerate, Binn of Burntisland.] concealed by herbage, but where\r\nthe rocks have been laid bare by the sea it may be most instructively\r\nstudied. In such shore-sections, a singular change of dip is often\r\nobservable among the strata round the edge of a vent. No matter what\r\nmay be the normal inclination at the locality, the beds are bent\r\nsharply down towards the wall of the neck, and are frequently placed\r\non end. This structure (shown in Figs. 24, 143, 147, 148 and 149)\r\nis precisely the reverse of what might have been anticipated, and\r\ncan hardly be due to upward volcanic explosions. It is frequently\r\nassociated with considerable metamorphism in the disturbed strata.\r\nShales are converted into porcellanite or various jaspery rocks,\r\naccording to their composition. Sandstones pass into quartzite, with\r\nits characteristic lustrous fracture. It is common to find vents\r\nsurrounded with a ring of this contact-metamorphism, which, from the\r\nhardness and frequently vertical or highly inclined bedding of its\r\nstrata, stands up prominently on the beach (as in Figs. 126 and 210),\r\nand serves to mark the position of the necks from a distance.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find an altogether satisfactory explanation of\r\nthis inward dip of the strata around vents. Taking it in connection\r\nwith the metamorphism, I am inclined to believe that it arose after\r\nthe close of the long-continued volcanic action which had hardened\r\nthe rocks around the volcanic pipe, and as the result of some kind of\r\nsubsidence within the vent. The outpouring of so much tuff and lava\r\nas escaped from many of the volcanoes would doubtless often be apt to\r\nproduce cavities underneath them, and on the decay of volcanic energy\r\nthere might be a tendency in the solid or cavernous column filling up\r\nthe funnel, to settle down by mere gravitation. So firmly, however, did\r\nmuch of it cohere to the sides of the pipe, that if it sank at all, it\r\ncould hardly fail to drag down a portion of these sides. So general\r\nis this evidence of downward movement in all the volcanic districts\r\nof Scotland where the necks have been adequately exposed, that the\r\nstructure may be regarded as normal to these volcanic vents. It has\r\nbeen observed among the shore-sections of the volcanoes of the Auckland\r\ndistrict, New Zealand. Mr. C. Heaphy, in an interesting paper upon\r\nthat district, gives a drawing of a crater and lava-stream abutting on\r\nthe edge of a cliff where the strata bend down towards the point of\r\neruption, as in the numerous cases in Scotland.[456]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ 1860, vol. xvi. p. 245.]\r\n\r\n_Evidence for the probable subærial Character of some of the Cones or\r\nPuys of Tuff._--From the stratigraphical data furnished by the basin\r\nof the Firth of Forth, it is certain that this region, during a great\r\npart of the Carboniferous period, existed as a wide shallow lagoon,\r\nsometimes overspread with sea-water deep enough to allow of the growth\r\nof corals, crinoids, and brachiopods; at other times, shoaled to such\r\nan extent with sand and mud as to be covered with wide jungles of a\r\nlepidodendroid and calamitoid vegetation. As volcanic action went on\r\ninterruptedly during a vast section of that period, the vents, though\r\ngenerally submarine, may occasionally have been subærial. Indeed, we\r\nmay suppose that the same vent might begin as a subaqueous orifice\r\nand continue to eject volcanic materials, until, as these rose above\r\nthe level of the water, the vent became subærial. An instance of a\r\nsubmarine vent has been cited from the Perthshire coal-field (p. 426).\r\n\r\nAmong the evidence which may be collected to show that some\r\nCarboniferous volcanoes probably rose as insular cones of tuff above\r\nthe surrounding waters, the structure of the tuff in many necks may be\r\ncited, for it suggests subærial rather than subaqueous stratification.\r\nThe way in which the stones, large and small, are grouped together\r\nin lenticular seams may be paralleled on the slopes of many a modern\r\nvolcano. Another indication of this mode of origin is supplied by\r\nthe traces of wood to be met with in some of the tuff-necks. The\r\nvents of Fife and Linlithgowshire contain these traces sometimes in\r\ngreat abundance. The specimens are always angular fragments, and\r\nare frequently encrusted with calcite.[457] Sometimes they present\r\nthe glossy fracture and clear ligneous structure shown by sticks of\r\nwell-made wood charcoal. In a neck at St. Magdalen's, near Linlithgow,\r\nthe wood fragments occur as numerous black chips. So far as can be\r\nascertained from the slices already prepared for the microscope, the\r\nwood is always coniferous. These woody fragments seldom occur in the\r\ninterstratified tuffs or in the associated strata where _Stigmaria_,\r\n_Lepidodendron_, etc., are common. They are specially characteristic of\r\nthe necks and adjacent tuffs. The parent trees may have grown on the\r\nvolcanic cones, which as dry insular spots would support a different\r\nvegetation from the club-mosses and reeds of the surrounding swamps. As\r\nthe fragments occur in the tuffs which, on the grounds already stated,\r\nmay be held to have been deposited within the crater, they seem to\r\npoint to intervals of volcanic quiescence, when the dormant or extinct\r\ncraters were filled with a terrestrial flora, as Vesuvius was between\r\nthe years 1500 and 1631, when no eruptions took place. Some of the\r\ncones, such as Saline Hill and the Binn of Burntisland, may have risen\r\nseveral hundred feet above the water. Clothed with dark pine woods,\r\nthey would form a notable feature in the otherwise monotonous scenery\r\nof central Scotland during the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: The largest I have observed is a portion of a stem about\r\ntwo feet long and six inches broad, in the (Permian?) neck below St.\r\nMonan's church.]\r\n\r\n_Entombment of the Volcanic Cones and their relation to the bedded\r\nLavas and Tuffs._--From the facts above detailed, it is evident that\r\nin most cases the necks represent, as it were, the mere denuded stumps\r\nof the volcanoes. As the puys took their rise in areas which, on the\r\nwhole, were undergoing a movement of subsidence, they were eventually\r\nsubmerged and buried under sedimentary accumulations. Their loose\r\nashes would be apt to be washed down and strewn over the sea-bottom,\r\nso that only the lower and inner part of a cone might remain. We can\r\nhardly hope to discover any of the actual craters among these volcanic\r\nrelics. The cones having been submerged and buried under many hundred\r\nfeet of sediment, their present position at the surface is due to\r\nsubsequent elevation and prolonged denudation. It is obvious that there\r\nmust still be many buried cones which the progress of denudation has\r\nnot yet reached. Some of these have been revealed in the course of\r\nmining operations. Valuable seams of coal, ironstone and oil-shale\r\nin the Scottish Carboniferous Limestone and Calciferous Sandstone\r\nseries are extensively worked, and in the underground operations many\r\nillustrations of former volcanic action have been met with. The most\r\nremarkable instances of the discovery of buried volcanoes have occurred\r\nin the Dalry coal-field in the north of Ayrshire. In one pit-shaft\r\nabout a mile and a half to the south-west of the village of Dalry, a\r\nthickness of 115 fathoms of tuff was passed through, and in another\r\npit 90 fathoms of similar tuff were sunk into before the position of\r\nthe black-band ironstone of that mineral field was reached by driving\r\nlevels through the tuff into the sedimentary strata outside of it.\r\nOnly a short distance from these thick piles of tuff, their place is\r\nentirely taken up by the ordinary sedimentary strata of the district.\r\nThe working-plans of the mines show the tuff to occur in irregular\r\npatches and strips, between which the ironstone is workable. From these\r\ndata we perceive that the shafts have in some cases been sunk directly\r\nupon the tops of puys of tuff, which were, in one case, nearly 700\r\nfeet, and in another instance, 540 high[458] (Fig. 146).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: Explanation of Sheet 22, _Geol. Surv. of Scotland_, p.\r\n16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 146.--Diagram of buried volcanic cone near Dalry, Ayrshire.\r\n     Constructed from information obtained in mining operations.\r\n\r\n  1.

A number of examples of this structure may\r\nbe observed in the basin of the Firth of Forth, where the degradation\r\nof the surface has not yet proceeded so far as to isolate the column\r\nof agglomerate or tuff from the sheets of tuff that were strewn around\r\nthe old volcano. In such cases, the actual limits of the vent are still\r\nmore or less concealed, or at least no sharp line can be drawn between\r\nthe vent and its ejections. As an illustration of this connection of a\r\nvolcanic pipe with the materials ejected from it over the surrounding\r\ncountry I would cite Saline Hill in the west of Fife. That eminence\r\nrises to a height of 1178 feet above the sea, out of a band of tuff\r\nwhich can be traced across the country for fully three miles. Numerous\r\nsections in the water-courses show that this tuff is regularly\r\ninterbedded in the Carboniferous Limestone series, so that the relative\r\ngeological date of its eruption can be precisely fixed. On the south of\r\nSaline Hill, coal and ironstone, worked under the tuff, prove that this\r\nportion of the mass belongs to the general sheet of loose ashes and\r\ndust, extending outwards from the original cone over the floor of the\r\nsheet of water in which the Carboniferous Limestone series of strata\r\nwas being deposited. But the central portion of the hill is occupied\r\nby one or more volcanic pipes. A section across the eminence from\r\nnorth-west to south-east would probably show the structure represented\r\nin Fig. 148. Immediately to the east of the Saline Hill lies another\r\neminence, known as the Knock Hill, which marks the site of another\r\neruptive vent. A coal-seam (the Little Parrot or Gas Coal) is worked\r\nalong its southern base, and is found to plunge down steeply towards\r\nthe volcanic rocks. This seam, however, is not the same as that worked\r\nunder the Saline Hill, but lies some 600 feet below it. Probably the\r\nwhole of the Knock Hill occupies the place of a former vent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--Section across the Saline Hills, Fife.\r\n\r\n  The thick parallel black lines mark the position of seams of coal\r\n     and ironstone, some of which are worked under Saline Hill. T,\r\n     Tuff of the necks; _t_, Tuff at a little distance from the cone,\r\n     interstratified with the ordinary sedimentary beds; B, Basalt.\r\n     The larger eminence is Saline Hill, the lower is Knock Hill.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA further stage of decay and denudation brings before us the entire\r\nseverance of the volcanic column from the materials that were ejected\r\nfrom it. An excellent example of this isolation of the neck in the\r\nmidst of surrounding masses of tuff and lava which proceeded from\r\nit is presented by the Binn of Burntisland, to which I have already\r\nalluded. A section across that eminence gives the geological structure\r\nrepresented in Fig. 149. The dip of the rocks away from the volcanic\r\npipe at this locality has been produced long after the volcanic\r\nphenomena had ceased. The arch here shown is really the prolongation\r\nand final disappearance of the great anticlinal fold of which the\r\nPentland Hills form the axis on the opposite side of the Firth. But\r\nif we restore the rocks to a horizontal, or approximately horizontal\r\nposition, we find the Binn of Burntisland rising among them in one or\r\nmore necks, which doubtless mark centres of volcanic activity in that\r\ndistrict. A series of smaller neck-like eminences runs for two miles\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nStriking as the forms of many of the necks are, and much as their\r\npresent conical forms resemble those of active and extinct volcanoes,\r\nthe evidence of extensive denudation proves that these contours are\r\nnot the original outlines of the Carboniferous vents, but are in every\r\ncase the result of prolonged waste. What we now see is a section of the\r\nvolcanic chimney, and the conical form is due to the way in which the\r\nmaterials filling the chimney have yielded to the forces of denudation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.--Section across the Binn of Burntisland, in an\r\nEast and West direction.\r\n\r\n1, Sandstones; 2, Limestone (Burdiehouse); 3, Shales, etc.; _b_, _b_,\r\nInterstratified basalts; _t_ _t_, Bedded tuff, etc.; T, Tuff of the\r\ngreat neck of Burntisland; B, Basalt veins.]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. BEDDED TUFFS AND LAVAS\r\n\r\nDuring at least the earlier part of the period of the puys, in some\r\ndistricts or from certain vents, such as those of East Fife, Western\r\nMidlothian, Eastern Linlithgowshire, Northern Ayrshire, Heads of Ayr\r\nand Lower Eskdale, only fine tuff seems to have been thrown out, which\r\nwe now find intercalated among the surrounding strata. These eruptions,\r\nneither so vigorous nor so long-continued as those of the plateaux,\r\nnever gave forth such thick and widespread sheets of fragmentary\r\nmaterials as those associated with the plateaux in East Lothian and the\r\nnorth-east of Ayrshire. A single discharge of ashes seems in many cases\r\nto have been the sole achievement of one of those little volcanoes;\r\nat least only one thin band of tuff may be discoverable to mark its\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe tuff of these solitary bands is seldom coarse in texture. It\r\nusually consists of the ordinary dull green paste, with dust and\r\nlapilli of basic pumice. The local variations in the tuffs of the\r\npuys generally arise mainly from differences in the composition,\r\nsize and numbers of the included ejected blocks. Generally the most\r\nabundant stones are pieces of different diabases, or basalts; then come\r\nfragments from the surrounding Carboniferous strata, from older tuffs\r\nand rarely from rocks of much deeper-seated origin.\r\n\r\nNow and then the eruptions of tuff have consisted of extremely fine\r\nvolcanic dust, which, mingling with water, took the form of a compact\r\nmudstone, as in the case of the Houston Marls (p. 423), which remind\r\none of a volcanic mud. But in most localities the discharge of\r\ntuff, though for a time it may have completely obscured the ordinary\r\ncontemporaneous sedimentation, was intermittent, so that in the\r\nintervals between successive showers of detritus, the deposition of\r\nnon-volcanic sediment went on as usual. Hence it is that bands of tuff,\r\nwhether they lie among lavas or among sedimentary formations, are apt\r\nto contain interstratifications of sandstone, shale, limestone or other\r\ndetrital deposit, and to pass insensibly into these. The extremely\r\ngentle gradation from volcanic into non-volcanic sediment, and the\r\noccasional reappearance of thin partings of tuff bring vividly before\r\nthe mind the slow dying out of volcanic energy among the Carboniferous\r\nlagoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 150.--Section in old quarry, west of Wester Ochiltree,\r\n     Linlithgowshire. Calciferous Sandstone series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe comparatively quiet character of the volcanic explosions, and the\r\ncontemporaneous undisturbed deposition of sediment during the earlier\r\npart of the puy period, are exemplified in many sections throughout the\r\nareas above enumerated, as will be more fully illustrated in subsequent\r\npages. Two typical examples may suffice for this general statement of\r\nthe characters of the discharges of tuff in the puy-eruptions. In the\r\nLinlithgowshire quarry represented in Fig. 150, where about ten feet of\r\nstrata have been exposed, a black shale (1) of the usual carbonaceous\r\ncharacter, so common in the Oil-shale series of this region, may be\r\nseen at the bottom of the section. It is covered by a bed of nodular\r\nbluish-grey tuff (2) containing black shale fragments. A second black\r\nshale (3) is succeeded by a second thin band of fine pale yellowish\r\ntuff (4). Black shale (5) again supervenes, containing rounded\r\nfragments of tuff, perhaps ejected lapilli, and passing up into a layer\r\nof tuff (6). It is evident that we have here a continuous deposit of\r\nblack shale which was three times interrupted by showers of volcanic\r\ndust and stones. At the close of the third interruption, the deposition\r\nof the shale was renewed and continued, with sufficient slowness to\r\npermit of the segregation of thin seams and nodules of clay ironstone\r\nround the decomposing organic remains of the muddy bottom (7). A fourth\r\nvolcanic interlude now took place, and the floor of the water was once\r\nmore covered with tuff (8). But the old conditions of deposit were\r\nimmediately afterwards resumed (9); the muddy bottom was abundantly\r\npeopled with ostracod crustaceans, while many fishes, whose coprolites\r\nhave been left in the mud, haunted the locality. At last, however, a\r\nmuch more serious volcanic explosion took place. A coarse agglomeratic\r\ntuff (10), with blocks sometimes nearly three feet in diameter, was\r\nthen thrown out, and overspread the lagoon.[459]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: See _Geol. Surv. Memoir of Edinburgh_, p. 45. These\r\ntuffs are further described on pp. 465 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe second illustration may be taken from the admirable coast-section\r\nbetween Burntisland and Kinghorn, where the number of intercalations\r\nof tuff is very great. Besides thicker well-marked bands, successive\r\ninnumerable thin layers occur there among the associated zones of\r\nsedimentary strata which separate the sheets of basalt. The character\r\nof these tuff-seams may be inferred from the following details of less\r\nthan two feet of rock at Pettycur Point:--\r\n\r\n  Tuff                                                 1·5 inch.\r\n  Limestone                                            0·2    \"\r\n  Tuff                                                 0·5    \"\r\n  Shale                                                0·2    \"\r\n  Tuff                                                 0·1    \"\r\n  Shale and tuff                                       1·0    \"\r\n  Shale                                                0·2    \"\r\n  Limestone                                            0·5    \"\r\n  Shale full of volcanic dust                          3·5    \"\r\n  Shaly limestone                                      1·5    \"\r\n  Laminated tufaceous limestone                        2·0    \"\r\n  Limestone in thin bands, with thin laminæ of tuff    0·8    \"\r\n  Granular tuff                                        0·6    \"\r\n  Argillaceous limestone, with diffused tuff           0·9    \"\r\n  Fine granular tuff                                   0·7    \"\r\n  Argillaceous limestone, with diffused tuff           1·5    \"\r\n  Laminated limestone                                  0·1    \"\r\n  Limestone, with parting of granular tuff in middle   0·9    \"\r\n  Tufaceous shale                                      2·0    \"\r\n  Limestone                                            0·4    \"\r\n  Shaly tuff                                           1·25   \"\r\n  Laminated limestone                                  0·1    \"\r\n  Tuff                                                 1·2    \"\r\n                                                      -----\r\n                                                      21·65 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Ejected volcanic block in Carboniferous\r\nstrata, Burntisland.\r\n\r\n  1.

The stone\r\n     is a pale diabase weighing about six or eight pounds.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch a section as this brings vividly before the mind a long-continued\r\nintermittent feeble volcanic action during pauses between successive\r\noutbursts of lava. In such intervals of quiescence, the ordinary\r\nsediment of the lagoons accumulated, and was mixed up with the debris\r\nsupplied by occasional showers of volcanic dust. In this Fife volcanic\r\nseries, thin layers of sandstone, streaked with remains of the\r\nCarboniferous vegetation; beds of shale full of cyprid-cases, ganoid\r\nscales, and fragmentary ferns; thin beds of limestone, and bands of\r\nfire-clay supporting seams of coal, are interleaved with strata of tuff\r\nand sheets of basalt. Now and then a sharp discharge of larger stones\r\nis seen to have taken place, as in the case of the block many years ago\r\ndescribed by me as having fallen and crushed down a still soft bed of\r\ncoal (Fig. 151).[460]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: _Geol. Mag._ vol. i. p. 22. This Fife coast-section is\r\ngiven in full at p. 470.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--View of volcanic agglomerate becoming finer\r\nabove. East end of Kingswood Craig, two miles east from Burntisland.]\r\n\r\nThe Fife coast-section from which these details are taken supplies\r\nalmost endless instances of the varying characters of the pyroclastic\r\nmaterials of the puy-eruptions. The very same cliff, bank or reef will\r\nshow at one point an accumulation of excessively coarse volcanic debris\r\nand at another thin laminæ of the finest dust and lapilli. These rapid\r\ngradations are illustrated in Fig. 152, which is taken from the east\r\nend of the Kingswood Craig. The lower part of the declivity is a coarse\r\nagglomerate which passes upward into finer tuff.\r\n\r\nBesides the thin partings and thicker layers of tuff which,\r\nintercalated among the sedimentary strata of the Carboniferous system,\r\nmark a comparatively feeble and intermittent volcanic activity, we meet\r\nin some localities with examples where the puys have piled up much\r\nthicker accumulations of fragmentary material without any intercalated\r\nstreams of lava, or interstratified sandstone, shale or limestone. Thus\r\nthe widespread Houston marls above described reach a thickness of some\r\n200 feet. The vents of the Saline Hills in Fife covered the sea-floor\r\nwith volcanic ashes to a depth of several hundred feet. In the north of\r\nAyrshire the first eruptions of the puys have formed a continuous band\r\nof fine tuff traceable for some 15 miles, and in places at least 200\r\nfeet thick.\r\n\r\nWhere volcanic energy reached its highest intensity during the time\r\nof the puys, not only tuffs but sheets of lava were emitted, which,\r\ngathering round the vents, formed cones or long, connected banks and\r\nridges. Of these there are four conspicuous examples in Scotland--the\r\nhills of the Burntisland district, the Bathgate Hills, the ground\r\nbetween Dalry and Galston in north Ayrshire, and a broken tract in\r\nLiddesdale. Nowhere in the volcanic history of this country have even\r\nthe minutest details of that history been more admirably preserved than\r\namong the materials erupted from puys in these respective districts.\r\n\r\nLava-cones, answering to solitary tuff-cones among the fragmental\r\neruptions, do not appear to have existed, or, like some of those in\r\nthe great lava-fields of Northern Iceland and Western America, must\r\nhave been mere small heaps of slag and cinders at the top of the\r\nlava-column, which were washed down and effaced during the subsidence\r\nand entombment of the volcanic materials. The lavas never occur without\r\ntraces of fragmentary discharges. Two successive streams of basalt may\r\nindeed be found at a given locality without any visible intercalation\r\nof tuff, but proofs of the eruption of fragmental material will\r\ngenerally be observed to occur somewhere in the neighbourhood,\r\nassociated with one or both of them, or with other lavas above or below\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhere the phenomena of the puys have been most typically developed,\r\nlavas and tuffs succeed each other in rapid succession, with numerous\r\nor occasional interstratifications of ordinary sediment. Perhaps the\r\nmost complete and interesting example of this association is to be\r\nfound on the coast between Burntisland and Kirkcaldy, where, out of a\r\ntotal thickness of rock which may be computed to be between 1500 and\r\n2000 feet, it will probably be a fair estimate to say that the igneous\r\nmaterials constitute four-fifths, or from\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Alternations of basalt and tuff with shale,\r\netc., Kingswood Craig, Burntisland.] 1200 to 1600 feet. The lavas\r\nare varieties of basalt ranging in character from a black compact\r\ncolumnar to a dirty green earthy cellular or slaggy rock. Each separate\r\nflow may be on the average about 20 or 30 feet in thickness. Columnar\r\nand amorphous sheets succeed each other without any interposition\r\nof fragmentary material (Fig. 171). But along the junctions of the\r\nseparate flows layers of red clay, like the bole between the basalts\r\nof the Giant's Causeway, may frequently be noticed. The characteristic\r\nslaggy aspect of the upper parts of these ancient _coulées_ is\r\nsometimes remarkably striking. The full details of this most\r\ninteresting section will be given in later pages (p. 470). But some of\r\nits more characteristic external features may be understood from the\r\nviews which are presented in Figs. 152, 153, 170, 171.\r\n\r\nThe general bedded character of the volcanic series is well shown in\r\nFig. 153, which represents the alternations of lavas and tuffs in\r\nthe Kingswood Craig two miles to the east of Burntisland. The harder\r\nbasalts will be seen to project as bold crags while the tuffs and\r\nother stratified deposits between them give rise to grassy slopes and\r\nhollows. A nearer view of the alternation of lavas and tuffs with\r\nnon-volcanic sedimentary deposits is supplied in Fig. 170, which is\r\ntaken from a part of the Fife coast a little further to the east than\r\nthe last illustration. Here one of the limestones of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series is overlain with shale and tuff, which, being easily\r\ndisintegrated, have been cut away by the waves, leaving the lava above\r\nto overhang and fall off in blocks. The columnar structure of some of\r\nthe basalts of this coast is well brought out in Fig. 171, which shows\r\nfurther how the columns sometimes merge into an amorphous part of the\r\nsame sheet.\r\n\r\nThese Fife basalts illustrate admirably the peculiarities of the sheets\r\nof lava which are intercalated among the Carboniferous strata. They\r\nshow how easy it generally is to discriminate between such sheets and\r\nintrusive sills. The true lavas are never so largely crystalline, nor\r\nspread out in such thick sheets as the sills; they are frequently\r\nslaggy and amygdaloidal, especially towards the top and bottom, the\r\ncentral portion being generally more fine-grained and sometimes\r\nporphyritic. Where most highly cellular they often decompose into a\r\ndull, earthy, dirty-green rock. Where they form a thick mass they are\r\nusually composed of different beds of varying texture. Except the\r\ndifferences between the more compact centre and the slaggy layer above\r\nand below, the bedded lavas do not present any marked variation in\r\ncomposition or structure within the same sheet. A striking exception to\r\nthis rule, however, is furnished by the Bathgate \"leckstone\" already\r\ndescribed.[461] This mass forms a continuation of the great basaltic\r\nridge of the Bathgate Hills, and though its exact relations to the\r\nsurrounding strata are concealed, it appears to be an interbedded and\r\nnot an intrusive sheet. The remarkable separation of its constituent\r\nminerals into an upper, lighter felspathic layer, and a lower, heavier\r\nlayer, rich in olivine, augite and iron-ores, is a structure which\r\nmight be more naturally expected to occur in a sill. An instance\r\nof its development in an undoubted sill will be described further\r\non. Nevertheless, if we follow the trend of the volcanic band of the\r\nBathgate Hills southward for only two miles beyond the picrite quarry,\r\nwe find in the Skolie Burn a rock in many respects similar, and\r\nquarried for the same purpose of building oven-soles. This \"leckstone\"\r\nis there seen to be surmounted by a group of calcareous shales and thin\r\nlimestones. The section laid bare in the stream is represented in Fig.\r\n154. Immediately above the diabase, which is highly cellular, lies a\r\ngreen felspathic sandstone or shale containing detached fragments of\r\nthe amygdaloid together with _Lingulæ_ and other shells. There seems no\r\nreason to doubt that this is a true interstratified lava.[462]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxix. (1879) p. 504.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: _Trans. Roy. Soc.

Yellow calcareous shelly sandstone; 4. Dark shale with\r\n     _Spiriferæ_, etc.; 5. Bed of blue crinoidal limestone; 6. Clays\r\n     and thin coal; 7. Black and blue calcareous shales and thin\r\n     limestones.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhere the puys attained their greatest development in Scotland, they\r\nrose in the shallow lagoons, and here and there from deeper parts of\r\nthe sea-bottom, until by their successive discharges of lavas and tuffs\r\nthey gradually built up piles of material, which, in the Linlithgow and\r\nBathgate district, may have been nearly 2000 feet in thickness. It must\r\nbe remembered, however, that the eruptions took place in a subsiding\r\narea, and that even the thickest volcanic ejections, if the downward\r\nmovement kept pace with the volcanic activity, need not have grown into\r\na lofty volcanic hill. Indeed, largely as the lavas and tuffs bulk in\r\nthe geology of some parts of Central Scotland, their eruption does not\r\nseem to have seriously interfered with the broader physical changes\r\nthat were in progress over the whole region. Thus the subsidence which\r\nled to the spread of a marine and limestone-making fauna over much of\r\nCentral Scotland included also the volcanic districts. The limestones,\r\nformed of crinoids, corals and other marine organisms, extended over\r\nthe submerged lavas and tuffs, and were even interstratified with them.\r\n\r\nWhile the volcanic materials are found to replace locally the ordinary\r\nCarboniferous sedimentary strata, it is interesting in this regard to\r\nnote that, during pauses in the volcanic activity, while the subsidence\r\ndoubtless was still going on, some groups of sandstones, shales or\r\nlimestones extended themselves across the volcanic ridges so as to\r\ninterpose, on more than one platform, a mass of ordinary sediment\r\nbetween the lavas or tuffs already erupted and those of succeeding\r\ndischarges, and thus to furnish valuable geological chronometers by\r\nwhich to define the stratigraphical horizons of the successive phases\r\nof volcanic energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Section across the volcanic ridge of the\r\nLinlithgow and Bathgate Hills, showing the intercalation of limestones\r\nthat mark important stratigraphical horizons.\r\n\r\n  1.

Their\r\nmaterials were supplied from many separate vents along their surface,\r\nbut probably never attained to anything approaching the elevation\r\nwhich they would have reached had they been poured out upon a stable\r\nplatform. This feature in the history of the volcanic ridges is\r\nadmirably shown by the fact just referred to, that recognizable\r\nstratigraphical horizons can sometimes be traced right through the\r\nheart of the thickest volcanic accumulations. One of the largest areas\r\nof basalts and tuffs connected with the puys is that of the Linlithgow\r\nand Bathgate Hills, where, as already remarked, a depth of some 2000\r\nfeet of igneous rocks has been piled up. Yet several well-known seams\r\nof stone can be traced through it, such as the Hurlet Limestone and the\r\nIndex Limestone (Fig. 155). Only at the north end, where the volcanic\r\nmass is thickest and the surface-exposures of rock are not continuous,\r\nhas it been impossible to subdivide the mass by mapping intercalations\r\nof sedimentary strata across it. It would thus seem that, even where\r\nthe amplest accumulations gathered round the puys, they formed low flat\r\ndomes, rather than prominent hills, which, as subsidence went on and\r\nthe tuff-cones were washed down, gradually sank under water, and were\r\nburied under the accumulating silt of the sea-floor.\r\n\r\nAs a detailed illustration of the manner in which the growth of\r\norganically-formed limestones and the deposit of ordinary sediment took\r\nplace concurrently with the occasional outflow of lava-streams over the\r\nsea-bottom, I may cite the section presented in another Linlithgowshire\r\nquarry (Fig. 156). At the bottom of the group of strata there exposed,\r\na pale amygdaloidal, somewhat altered basalt (A) marks the upper\r\nsurface of one of the submarine lavas of the period. Directly over it\r\ncomes a bed of limestone (B) 15 feet thick, the lower layers of which\r\nare made up of a dense growth of the thin-stemmed coral _Lithostrotion\r\nirregulare_. The next stratum is a band of dark shale (C) about two\r\nfeet thick, followed by about the same thickness of an impure limestone\r\nwith shale seams (D). The conditions for coral and crinoid growth\r\nwere evidently not favourable, for this argillaceous limestone was\r\neventually arrested first by the deposit of a dark mud, now to be seen\r\nin the form of three or four inches of a black pyritous shale (E), and\r\nnext by the inroad of a large quantity of dark sandy mud and drift\r\nvegetation, which has been preserved as a sandy shale (F), containing\r\n_Calamites_, _Producti_, ganoid scales and other traces of the life of\r\nthe time. Finally, a great sheet of lava, represented by the uppermost\r\namygdaloid (G), overspread the area, and sealed up these records of\r\nPalæozoic history.[463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: _Geol. Surv. Mem._ \"Geology of Edinburgh,\" p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Section in Wardlaw Quarry, Linlithgowshire.]\r\n\r\nAmong the phenomena associated with the Carboniferous volcanoes mention\r\nmay, in conclusion, be made of the evidence for the former existence\r\nof thermal springs and saline sublimations or incrustations. Among the\r\nplateau-tuffs of North Berwick, as has been already pointed out (p.\r\n390), a fœtid limestone has been quarried, which bears indications\r\nof having been deposited by springs, probably in connection with the\r\nvolcanic action of the district. The lower limestones of Bathgate\r\nfurnish abundant laminæ of silica interleaved with calcareous matter,\r\nthe whole probably due to the action of siliceous and calcareous\r\nsprings connected with the active puys of that district. Some\r\nportions of the limestone are full of cellular spaces, lined with\r\nchalcedony.[464] A saline water has been met with among the volcanic\r\nrocks to the west of Linlithgow, in a bore which was sunk to a depth of\r\n348 feet in these rocks without reaching their bottom. The water that\r\nrose from the bore-hole was found to contain as much as 135 grains of\r\nchloride of sodium in the gallon. It is not improbable that this salt\r\nwas originally produced by incrustations on the Carboniferous lavas\r\nimmediately after their eruption, as has happened so often in recent\r\ntimes at Vesuvius, and that it was then buried under succeeding showers\r\nof tuff and streams of lava.[465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: _Ibid._ p. 49, _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. ix. p. 367. Besides\r\nchloride of sodium the water contained also chlorides of calcium,\r\nmagnesium and potassium, carbonates of lime and magnesia, sulphate of\r\nlime, and other ingredients in minute proportions.]\r\n\r\n_Subsequent Dislocation of Bedded Lavas and Tuffs._--As the\r\ninterstratified volcanic materials were laid down in sheets at the\r\nsurface, they necessarily behave like the ordinary sedimentary strata,\r\nand have undergone with them the various curvatures and fractures\r\nwhich have occurred since Carboniferous times. Notwithstanding their\r\nvolcanic nature, they can be traced and mapped precisely as if they\r\nhad been limestones or sandstones. This perfect conformability with\r\nthe associated stratified rocks is strikingly seen in the case of the\r\nsheets of lava which lie imbedded in the heart of the great volcanic\r\nridge of Linlithgowshire. The overlying strata having been removed from\r\ntheir surface for some distance, and the ground having been broken by\r\nfaults, these volcanic rocks might at first be taken for irregular\r\nintrusive bosses, but their true character is that shown in Fig. 157,\r\nwhere by a succession of faults, with a throw in the same direction,\r\nthe upper basalts of Bonnytoun Hill are gradually brought down to the\r\nlevel of the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--Section from Linlithgow Loch to the Firth of\r\nForth.]\r\n\r\n\r\niii. SILLS, BOSSES AND DYKES\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristic features of Central Scotland is the great\r\nnumber, and often the large size and extraordinary persistence, of\r\nthe masses of eruptive, more or less basic material, which have been\r\ninjected among the Carboniferous strata. The precise geological age\r\nof these intrusions cannot, of course, be more exactly defined than\r\nby stating that they are younger than the rocks which they traverse,\r\nthough in many cases their association with the necks, lavas and\r\ntuffs is such as to show that they must be regarded as part of the\r\nCarboniferous volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\nSills.--With regard to the sills I have been led, for the following\r\nreasons, to connect the great majority of them with the puys, though\r\nsome are certainly of far later date, while others should possibly be\r\nassigned to the plateaux.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the sills obviously connected with the plateaux\r\nare in great measure intermediate, or even somewhat acid rocks, while\r\nthose of the puy series are much more basic. It is hardly possible,\r\nhowever, in all cases to decide to which series a particular sill\r\nshould be assigned. This difficulty is particularly manifest in the\r\nwestern part of Midlothian, where the plateau of that district exhibits\r\nsuch frequent interruption, and where it often consists only of a\r\nsingle basaltic sheet. To the west of it lie the abundant puys with\r\ntheir lavas and tuffs, and between the two volcanic areas numerous\r\nsills of dolerite and diabase make their appearance. In the difficulty\r\nof deciding to which series these sills should be referred, it will be\r\nconvenient to consider them with those of the puys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--Section across the Campsie Fells illustrating\r\nthe contrast between the sills below and above the plateau-lavas.\r\n\r\n1. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 2. \"Ballagan Beds\"; 3. Tuffs; 4. Lavas of\r\nthe Campsie district of the Clyde plateau; 5 5. Necks belonging to the\r\nplateau volcanic series; 6. Trachytic sills belonging to the plateau;\r\n7. Carboniferous Limestone series; 8. Dolerite sills cutting the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series. _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable illustration of the contrast in petrographical character\r\nbetween the typical sills of the plateaux and those of the puys is\r\nfurnished by the chain of the Campsie Fells, where, on the north\r\nside, among the Calciferous Sandstones which emerge from under the\r\nandesitic lavas of the Clyde plateau, many intrusive sheets and bosses\r\nof trachytic material may be seen, while on the southern side come the\r\ngreat basic sills which, from Milngavie by Kilsyth to Stirling, run\r\nin the Carboniferous Limestone series (Fig. 158). A similar contrast\r\nmay be observed in Renfrewshire between the trachytic sills below the\r\nplateau-lavas south of Greenock and the basic sills above these lavas\r\nin the Carboniferous Limestone series around Johnstone and Paisley.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the more basic sills, as a rule, appear on\r\nplatforms higher in stratigraphical position than the plateaux, and\r\nwherever this is their position there cannot be any hesitation in\r\ndeciding against their association with the older phase of volcanic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the basic sills often occur in obvious connection\r\nwith the vents or bedded lavas and tuffs of the puy series. A\r\nconspicuous example of this dependence is supplied by the intrusive\r\nsheets of Burntisland, underlying the basalts and tuffs of that\r\ndistrict in the immediate neighbourhood of some of the vents from which\r\nthese bedded rocks were erupted (Fig. 159).\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, even where no visible vents appear now at the\r\nsurface near the sills, the latter generally occupy horizons within\r\nthe stratigraphical range indicated by the interbedded volcanic rocks.\r\nIt must be remembered that all the Carboniferous vents were deeply\r\nburied under sedimentary deposits, and that large as is the number of\r\nthem which has been exposed by denudation, it is probably much smaller\r\nthan the number still concealed from our view. The sills are to be\r\nregarded as deep-seated parts of the volcanic protrusions, and they\r\nmore especially appear at the surface where the strata between which\r\nthey were injected crop out from under some of the higher members of\r\nthe Carboniferous system. Thus the remarkable group of sills between\r\nKilsyth and Stirling (Fig. 158) may quite possibly be connected with\r\na group of vents lying not far to the eastward, but now buried under\r\nthe higher parts of the Carboniferous Limestone, Millstone Grit and\r\nCoal-measures. Again, the great series of sills that gives rise to\r\nsuch a conspicuous range of hills in the north and middle of Fife\r\nmay have depended for its origin upon the efforts of a line of vents\r\nrunning east and west through the centre of the county, but now buried\r\nunder the Coal-measures. Some vents, indeed, have been laid bare in\r\nthat district, such as the conspicuous groups of the Saline Hills\r\nand the Hill of Beath, but many more may be concealed under higher\r\nCarboniferous strata further east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Section showing the position of the basic\r\nsills in relation to the volcanic series at Burntisland, Fife.\r\n\r\n  1.

Three sills.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, the materials of which the sills consist link them\r\nin petrographical character with those that proceeded from the puys.\r\nThe rocks of the intrusive sheets in West Lothian, Midlothian and Fife\r\nare very much what an examination of the bedded lavas of the puys in\r\nthe same region would lead us to expect. There is, of course, the\r\nmarked textural difference between masses of molten rock which have\r\ncooled very slowly within the crust of the earth and those which have\r\nsolidified with rapidity at the surface, the sills being for the most\r\npart much more coarsely crystalline than the lavas, and more uniform in\r\ntexture throughout, though generally finer at the margins than at the\r\ncentre. There is likewise the further contrast arising from differences\r\nin the composition of the volcanic magma at widely-separated periods\r\nof its extravasation. At the time when the streams of basalt flowed\r\nout from the puys its constitution was comparatively basic, in some\r\nlocalities even extremely basic. Any sills dating from that time may\r\nbe expected to show an equal proportion of bases. But those which were\r\ninjected at a long subsequent stage in the volcanic period may well\r\nhave been considerably more acid.\r\n\r\nIn actual fact the petrographical range of the sills reasonably\r\nreferable to the puy-eruptions varies from picrite or limburgite to\r\ndolerite without olivine. The great majority of these sheets in the\r\nbasin of the Firth of Forth, where they are chiefly displayed, are\r\ndolerites (diabases), sometimes with, but more frequently without,\r\nolivine. They include all the more coarsely crystalline rocks of the\r\nregion, though occasionally they are ordinary close-grained basalts.\r\nTheir texture may be observed to bear some relation to their mass,\r\nso far at least as that, where they occur in beds only two or three\r\nfeet or yards in thickness, they are almost invariably closer-grained.\r\nA cellular or amygdaloidal texture is seldom to be observed among\r\nthem, and never where they are largely crystalline. This texture is\r\nmost often to be found in thin sills which have been injected among\r\ncarbonaceous shales or coals. These intrusive sheets are generally\r\nfinely cellular, and more or less decayed (\"white trap\").\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--Sills between shales and sandstones, Hound\r\nPoint, Linlithgowshire.]\r\n\r\nDifferences of texture may often be observed within short distances\r\nin the same sill, and likewise considerable varieties in colour and\r\ncomposition. The most finely crystalline portions are, as usual, those\r\nalong the junction with the stratified rocks, the most crystalline\r\noccurring in the central parts of the mass. A diminution in the size\r\nof the crystalline constituents may be traced not only at the base,\r\nbut also at the top of a sheet, or at any intermediate portion which\r\nhas come in contact with a large mass of the surrounding rock. A good\r\nillustration is supplied by the intrusive sheet at Hound Point (Fig.\r\n160), to the east of South Queensferry, where some layers of shale\r\nhave been involved in the igneous rock, which becomes remarkably\r\nclose-grained along the junction.[466] This change in texture and\r\nabsence of cellular structure form a well-marked distinction between\r\nthese sheets and those which have flowed out at the surface as true\r\nlava-streams.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: See Hay Cunningham's \"Essay,\" p. 66, and plate ix.; and\r\n_Geol. Survey Memoir_ on \"Geology of Edinburgh,\" p. 114.]\r\n\r\nSome of the larger doleritic sills display a somewhat coarsely\r\ncrystalline texture in their central portions, and occasionally\r\npresent a notable micropegmatitic aggregate, which plays the part of\r\ninterstitial substance enclosing the other minerals. Mr. Teall has\r\nreferred to the frequent occurrence of this structure in the coarser\r\nparts of the Whin Sill of the north of England.[467] It occurs also in\r\na marked degree in the Ratho sill and in some portions of the great\r\ndoleritic sill of which the crags of Stirling form a part.[468]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: _British Petrography_, p. 208.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: Mr. H. W. Monckton. _Quart. Journal Geol. Soc._ vol. li.\r\n(1895), p. 482.]\r\n\r\nBut beside the differences in texture, mainly due to varying rates of\r\ncooling, the sills sometimes exhibit striking varieties of composition\r\nin the same mass of rock. These variations are more especially\r\nnoticeable among the larger sills, and particularly where the material\r\nis most markedly basic. The special type of differentiation, so\r\nnoticeable in the Bathgate diabase and picrite mass already alluded\r\nto, is likewise well exhibited in an intrusive sheet or group of\r\nsheets, recently exposed at Barnton, in the cutting of a railway from\r\nEdinburgh to Cramond[469] (Fig. 161). The intrusive nature of the\r\nseveral bands of igneous rock which occur here is made quite evident\r\nby the alteration they have produced upon the shales with which they\r\nhave come in contact. It is the uppermost and most extensive of these\r\nsills which specially deserves notice, for the differentiation of its\r\nconstituents. It stretches along the cutting for several hundred yards\r\nat an angle of dip of about 15°. At the western or upper part of the\r\nmass its actual contact with the superincumbent sedimentary strata is\r\nnot visible, but as the igneous rock is there a good deal finer in\r\ngrain than elsewhere, its upper surface cannot be many feet distant.\r\nThe upper visible portion is a light well-crystallized dolerite with\r\na rudely bedded structure, the planes dipping westwards at 15°. About\r\n20 or 30 feet below the upper visible termination of the mass, the\r\ndark ferro-magnesian minerals begin rapidly to increase in relative\r\nproportion to the pale felspar, and the rock consequently becomes\r\ndark-greenish brown. The change is particularly noticeable in certain\r\nbands which run parallel with the general dip. There is no definite\r\nline between the pale and dark body of the rock, the two graduating\r\ninto each other and the darker part becoming deeper in colour, heavier\r\nand more decomposing, until it becomes a true typical picrite. Even\r\nin this ultra-basic portion the same rude bedding or banding may be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: This rock has been described by Mr. J. Henderson and\r\nMr. Goodchild, _Trans. Geol. Soc. Edin._ vi. (1893) pp. 297, 301, and\r\nby Mr. H. W. Monckton, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ l. (1894) p. 39. Mr.\r\nGoodchild recognized the occurrence of picrite, and Mr. Monckton has\r\ndescribed the succession of rocks, and given a diagram of them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--Section of Sill, Cramomd Railway, Barnton,\r\nnear Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  1. Baked shale; 2. Sill of very felspathic dolerite about, nine\r\n     feet thick; 3. Baked shale, eight inches; 4. Dolerite showing\r\n     chilled fine-grained edge and adhering firmly to the shale\r\n     below; it rapidly passes up into (5) Picrite with white\r\n     felspathic veins (6); 7. Junction of picrite and dolerite with a\r\n     similar vein along the line of contact; 8. Large globular body\r\n     of dolerite enclosing a mass of picrite.\r\n]\r\n\r\nVeins in which felspar predominates over the darker minerals traverse\r\nthe rock, sometimes parallel with the bedding, sometimes across it.\r\nThey vary from less than an inch to a foot in width, sometimes dividing\r\nand enclosing parts of the surrounding mass. But that they are on the\r\nwhole contemporaneous with the sill itself, and not long subsequent\r\ninjections, is shown by the way in which the dark ferro-magnesian\r\nminerals project from the picrite into the veins and lock the two\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut besides these injections, which doubtless represent the last\r\nand more acid portions of the magma injected into the basic parts\r\nbefore the final consolidation of the whole, there are to be observed\r\nirregular concretionary patches, of similar character to the veins,\r\ndistributed through the picrite. On the other hand, towards its base\r\nthe sill becomes a coarse dolerite round which the picrite is wrapped,\r\nand which encloses a detached portion of that rock.\r\n\r\nIt is deserving of note that while the ultra-basic portion descends\r\nalmost to the very bottom of the sill, the lowest five feet show the\r\nsame change as occurs at the top of the mass. There the felspar\r\nrapidly begins to predominate over the darker minerals, and the\r\ndolerite into which the rock passes shows a fine-grained margin\r\nadhering firmly to the shales on which it rests. This lower doleritic\r\nband, showing as it does the effect of chilling upon its under surface,\r\nmay be due to more rapid cooling and crystallization, while in the\r\noverlying parts the mass remained sufficiently mobile to allow of a\r\nseparation of the heavier minerals from the felspars, which appear in\r\npredominant quantity towards the top. It must be frankly admitted,\r\nhowever, that we are still very ignorant of the causes which led to\r\nthis separation of ingredients in a few sills, while they were entirely\r\nabsent or non-efficient in most of them.\r\n\r\nThe intrusive character of the Carboniferous sills of Central Scotland\r\nand their contact-metamorphism have been fully described, and some\r\nof them have become, as it were, \"household words\" in geology.[470]\r\nExposed in so many fine natural sections in the vicinity of Edinburgh,\r\nthey early attracted the notice of geologists, and furnished a\r\nbattle-ground on which many a conflict took place between the Plutonist\r\nand Neptunist champions at the beginning of the present century.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: See, for instance, Maclaren's _Geology of Fife and\r\nthe Lothians_, 1839; Hay Cunningham's _Essay_, previously cited;\r\n_Geological Survey Memoir on the Geology of Edinburgh_ (Sheet 32),\r\n1861; Mr. Allport, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxx. (1874) p. 553;\r\nTeall, _British Petrography_, p. 187; E. Stecher, _Contacterscheinungen\r\nan schottischen Olivindiabasen_, Tschermak's _Mineralog. Mittheil._\r\nvol. ix. (1887) p. 145; _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xv. (1888) p. 160.]\r\n\r\nAs the sills frequently lie in even sheets perfectly parallel with\r\nthe bedding of the strata between which they have been injected, care\r\nis required in some cases to establish that they are of intrusive\r\norigin. One of the most obvious tests for this purpose is furnished by\r\nthe alteration they produce among the strata through which they have\r\nmade their way, whether these lie above or below them. The strata are\r\nsometimes crumpled up in such a manner as to indicate considerable\r\npressure. They are occasionally broken into fragments, though this\r\nmay have been due rather to the effects of gaseous explosions than to\r\nthe actual protrusion of melted rock. But the most frequent change\r\nsuperinduced upon them is an induration which varies greatly in\r\namount even along the edge of the same intrusive sheet. Sandstones\r\nare hardened into quartzite, breaking with a smooth clear glistening\r\nfracture. Coals are converted into a soft sooty substance, sometimes\r\ninto anthracite. Limestones acquire a crystalline saccharoid structure.\r\nShales pass generally into a kind of porcellanite, but occasionally\r\nexhibit other types of contact-metamorphism. Thus below the thick\r\npicrite sill at Barnton, near Edinburgh, the shales have assumed a\r\nfinely concretionary structure by the appearance in them of spherical\r\npea-like aggregates.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of intrusion is to be found in the manner in which sills\r\ncatch up and completely enclose portions of the overlying strata. The\r\nwell-known examples on Salisbury Crags (Fig. 162) are paralleled by\r\nscores of other instances in different parts of the same region.\r\n\r\nMoreover, sills do not always remain on the same horizon; that is,\r\nbetween the same strata. They may be observed to steal across or break\r\nthrough the beds, so as to lie successively between different layers.\r\nNo more instructive example of this relation on a small scale could\r\nbe cited than that of the intrusive sheet which has been laid open\r\nin the Dodhead Limestone Quarry, near Burntisland. As shown in the\r\naccompanying figure (Fig. 163), this rock breaks through the limestone\r\nand then spreads out among the overlying shales, across which it passes\r\nobliquely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Intrusive dolerite sheet enclosing and sending\r\nthreads into portions of shale, Salisbury Crags, Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nAmong the larger sills this transgressive character is seen to be\r\nsometimes manifested on a great scale. Thus, along the important belt\r\nof intrusive rocks that runs from Kilsyth to Stirling, the Hurlet\r\nLimestone lies in one place below, in another above, the invading\r\nmass, but in the intervening ground has been engulphed in it. Similar\r\nevidence of the widely separate horizons occupied by different parts of\r\nthe same sill is supplied at Kilsyth, where the intrusive sheet lies\r\nabout 70 or 80 fathoms below the Index Limestone, while at Croy, in the\r\nsame neighbourhood, it actually passes above that seam.[471]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: Explanation of Sheet 31, _Geological Survey of\r\nScotland_, §§ 43 and 83.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Intrusive sheet invading limestone and shale,\r\nDodhead Quarry, near Burntisland.]\r\n\r\nOther interesting evidence of the intrusive nature of the Carboniferous\r\ndolerite sills of Central Scotland is supplied by the internal\r\nmodifications which the eruptive rock has undergone by contact with\r\nthe strata between which it has been thrust. These alterations, though\r\npartly visible to the naked eye, are best studied in thin slices with\r\nthe aid of the microscope. Tracing the variations of an intrusive\r\ndolerite outwards in the direction of the rocks which it has invaded,\r\nwe perceive change first in the augite. The large crystals and kernels\r\nof that mineral grow smaller until they pass into a granulated form\r\nlike that characteristic of basalts. The large plates and amorphous\r\npatches of titaniferous iron or magnetite give place to minute\r\nparticles, which tend to group themselves into long club-shaped bodies.\r\nThe labradorite continues but little affected, except that its prisms,\r\nthough as defined, may not be quite so large. The interstitial glassy\r\ngroundmass remains in much the same condition and relative amount as in\r\nthe centre of the rock.\r\n\r\nAlong the line of contact, while the dolerite becomes exceedingly\r\nclose-grained, its felspar crystals are still quite distinct even up\r\nto the very edge. But they become fewer in relative number, and still\r\nsmaller in size, though an occasional prism two or three millimetres\r\nin length may occur. They retain also their sharpness of outline, and\r\ntheir comparative freedom from enclosures of any kind. They tend to\r\nrange themselves parallel with the surface of the contact-rock. The\r\naugite exists as a finely granular pale green substance, which might\r\nat first be taken for a glass, but it gives the characteristic action\r\nof augite with polarized light. It is intimately mixed through the\r\nclear glass of the groundmass, which it far exceeds in quantity. The\r\niron oxides now appear as a fine granular dust, which is frequently\r\naggregated into elongated club-shaped objects, as if round some inner\r\npellucid or translucent microlite. In patches throughout the field,\r\nhowever, the oxides take the form of a geometrically perfect network of\r\ninterlacing rods. This beautiful structure, described and figured by\r\nZirkel and others,[472] is never to be seen in any of the dolerites,\r\nexcept close to the line of contact with the surrounding rocks. It\r\noccurs also in some of the dykes. I have not succeeded in detecting any\r\nmicrolites in the sandstones at the edge of a dolerite sheet, though I\r\nhave had many slices prepared for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: _Mikroskopische Beschaffenheit der Mineralien und\r\nGesteine_, p. 273; Vogelsang's _Krystalliten_.]\r\n\r\nWhere one of the dolerite sills has invaded sandstone, there is usually\r\na tolerably sharp line of demarcation between the two rocks, though it\r\nis seldom easy to procure a hand-specimen showing the actual contact,\r\nfor the stone is apt to break along the junction-line. Where, however,\r\nthe rock traversed by the igneous mass is argillaceous shale, we may\r\nfind a thorough welding of the two substances into each other. In such\r\ncases the dolerite at the actual contact becomes a dark opaque rock,\r\nwhich in thin slices under the microscope is found to be formed of a\r\nmottled or curdled segregation of exceedingly minute black grains and\r\nhairs in a clear glassy matrix, in which the augite and felspar are not\r\nindividualized. But even in this tachylyte-like rock perfectly formed\r\nand very sharply defined crystals of triclinic felspar may be observed\r\nranging themselves as usual parallel to the bounding surfaces of the\r\nrock. These characters are well seen in the contact of the intrusive\r\nsheet of dolerite with shale and sandstone at Hound Point (Fig. 160).\r\n\r\nAnother instructive example is furnished by the small threads which\r\nproceed from the dolerite of Salisbury Crags, and traverse enclosed\r\nfragments of shale (Fig. 162). Some of these miniature dykes are\r\nnot more than one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and may therefore\r\neasily be included, together with part of the surrounding rock, in\r\nthe field of the microscope. The dolerite in these ramifications\r\nassumes an exceedingly fine texture. The felspar is the only mineral\r\ndistinctly formed into definite crystals. It occurs in prisms of an\r\nearly consolidation, sometimes one-fifth of an inch long, and therefore\r\nreadily recognizable by the naked eye. These prisms are perfectly\r\nshaped, contain abundant twin lamellæ, and show enclosures of the iron\r\nof the base. They had been already completely formed at the time of\r\ninjection; for occasionally they may be observed projecting beyond\r\nthe wall of the vein into the adjacent shale or sandstone, and they\r\nhave ranged themselves parallel to the sides of the vein.[473] The\r\nblack ground, from which these large well-defined crystals stand out\r\nprominently, consists of a devitrified glass, rendered dark by the\r\nmultitude of its enclosed black opaque microlites. These are very\r\nminute grains and rudely feathered rods, with a tendency to group\r\nthemselves here and there into forms like portions of the rhombohedral\r\nskeletons of titaniferous iron. So thoroughly fused and liquid has\r\nthe dolerite been at the time of its injection, that little threads\r\nof it, less than 1/100 of an inch in diameter, consisting of the same\r\ndark base, with well-defined felspars, may be seen isolated within the\r\nsurrounding sedimentary rock. Minute grains and rounded portions of the\r\nlatter may also be noticed in the marginal parts of the dolerite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: The infusibility of the felspar was well shown in some\r\nexperiments on the rocks of the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, made at\r\nmy request by Dr. R. S. Marsden, who subjected some of these rocks to\r\nfusion at the laboratory of the University of Edinburgh. Microscopic\r\nsections were prepared of the products obtained. The basalt of Lion's\r\nHaunch is peculiarly instructive. Its large labradorite crystals have\r\nresisted the intense white heat which, continued for four hours, has\r\nreduced the rest of the minerals to a perfect glass. We can thus\r\nwell understand how large definite crystals of felspar should have\r\nsurvived or appeared in dykes and veins while the rock was still\r\nthoroughly liquid. The glass obtained from the Lion's Haunch rock is of\r\na honey-yellow, and contains translucent tufted microlites. The iron\r\nforms beautiful dendritic films in the cracks. Altogether, the glass\r\npresents a strong resemblance to the palagonitic substance so abundant\r\namong the lapilli in the tuffs of the vents.]\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that specimens taken from the edge of an intrusive\r\nsheet, where the rock has rapidly chilled and solidified, represent to\r\nus an earlier stage in the history of the whole mass than specimens\r\ntaken from its central portions. In fact, a series of samples collected\r\nat short intervals from the outer contact to the inner mass shows, as\r\nit were, the successive stages in the consolidation of the molten rock.\r\n\r\nFrom the observations just described, it appears that the triclinic\r\nfelspars began to assume the shape of large definite crystals before\r\nany of the other minerals. These felspars already existed when the\r\nmolten mass forced its way among the shales, for they can be seen\r\nlying with their long axes parallel to the surface of shale, precisely\r\nas, in the well-known flow-structures, they behave round a large\r\ncrystal embedded in the heart of a rock. A few feet from where the\r\nconsolidation was not so rapid, the iron oxides have grouped themselves\r\ninto incipient crystalline forms and skeleton crystals; the felspar\r\ncrystals abundantly occur, and the augite has been left in the finely\r\ngranular condition. Still further towards the interior of the mass, the\r\nnormal character of the dolerite is gradually assumed.[474]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: For a further and more detailed investigation of the\r\ncontact phenomena of the Carboniferous doleritic sills of the basin of\r\nthe Firth of Forth, see the papers by Dr. Stecher, quoted on p. 451.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Spheroidal weathering of dolerite sill,\r\nquarry east of North Queensferry, Fife.]\r\n\r\nWhere a sill has been injected among carbonaceous shales and coals it\r\nhas undergone great alteration along the contact, and if the sheet is\r\nonly a few inches or feet thick, the change extends throughout its\r\nwhole mass. Black basalts and dolerites, in such circumstances, pass\r\ninto a substance like a white or pale yellow clay, which at first might\r\nbe mistaken for some band of fire-clay intercalated among the other\r\nsediments. But evidence of actual intrusion may usually be found, as\r\nwhere the igneous rock has caught up or broken through the adjacent\r\nstrata, besides altering them. Such \"white traps,\" as they have been\r\ncalled, have long been familiar in the coal-fields of Scotland and\r\nCentral England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Two thin sills of \"White Trap\" injected into\r\nblack carbonaceous shale overlying the Hurlet Limestone, Hillhouse\r\nQuarry, Linlithgow.\r\n\r\n  1. Hurlet Limestone; 2. Black shales; 3 3. Two sills of \"White\r\n     Trap\"; 4. Columnar Basalts.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs a good illustration of the behaviour of such thin sills among\r\ncarbonaceous shales I give here a section (Fig. 165) exposed in the\r\nold limestone quarry of Hillhouse, south of Linlithgow. At the bottom\r\nlies the Hurlet Limestone which has once been extensively mined at this\r\nlocality. Above it comes a group of black shales which in turn are\r\nsurmounted by a sheet of beautifully columnar basalt. The shales seem\r\nat first sight to include two layers of pale fire-clay, each only a few\r\ninches in thickness. Closer inspection, however, will show that these\r\ntwo thin intercalations are really sills which, though on the whole\r\nparallel with the bedding of the shale, may be seen to cut across it,\r\nand even at one place to send a finger into it. The upper example may\r\nalso be observed to diminish rapidly in thickness in one direction.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the sills vary within tolerably wide limits. Although\r\nhere and there the injected material dwindles down to an inch or less\r\nin thickness, running away even into threads, it more usually forms\r\nsheets of considerable depth. The rock of Salisbury Crags, for example,\r\nis fully 150 feet thick at its maximum. That of Corstorphine Hill is\r\nprobably about 350 feet. The great sheet which runs among the lower\r\nlimestones from Kilsyth by Denny to Stirling has been bored through to\r\na depth of 276 feet, but as the bore started on the rock, and not in\r\noverlying strata, some addition may need to be made to that thickness.\r\n\r\nThe spheroidal weathering so characteristic of basic eruptive rocks\r\nis nowhere more characteristically displayed than among the great\r\ndoleritic sills of the basin of the Firth of Forth. As an illustration\r\nof this structure an example is taken here from the large sheet at\r\nNorth Queensferry (Fig. 164).\r\n\r\nWhile one is struck with the great size and extent of some of the sills\r\nconnected with the puys, as compared with the small and local sheets\r\nunderneath the plateaux, there is a further fact regarding them that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--Dyke cutting the agglomerate of a neck. Binn\r\nof Burntisland.] deserves remark--their capricious distribution.\r\nTheir occurrence seems to have little or no relation to the measure\r\nof volcanic energy as manifested in superficial eruptions. Thus in\r\nthe north of Ayrshire, where a long band of lavas and tuffs, pointing\r\nto vigorous activity, lies at the top of the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries, and where the strata underneath it are abundantly exposed\r\nat the surface, the sills occur as thin and inconstant bands in the\r\ncentral and eastern parts of the district only. The bedded lavas and\r\ntuffs at the head of the Slitrig Water have no visible accompaniment of\r\nsills. On the other hand, in the Edinburgh and Burntisland districts,\r\nthe sills bear a large proportion to the amount of bedded lavas and\r\ntuffs, while in the Bathgate and Linlithgow district, where the\r\nsuperficial eruptions were especially vigorous and prolonged, the sills\r\nare of trifling extent.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from these facts that the extent to which the crust of\r\nthe earth round a volcanic orifice is injected with molten rock, in the\r\nform of intrusive sheets between the strata, does not depend upon the\r\nenergy of the volcano as gauged by its superficial outpourings, but on\r\nother considerations not quite apparent. Possibly, the more effectively\r\nvolcanic energy succeeded in expelling materials from the vent, the\r\nless opportunity was afforded for subterranean injections. And if the\r\nprotrusion of the sills took place after the vents were solidly sealed\r\nup with agglomerate or lava, it would doubtless often be easier for\r\nthe impelled magma to open a way for itself laterally between the\r\nbedding-planes of the strata than vertically through the thick solid\r\ncrust. The size and extent of the sills may thus be a record of the\r\nintensity of this latest phase of the volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--Boss of diabase cutting the Burdiehouse\r\nLimestone and sending sills and veins into the overlying shales.\r\nRailway cutting, West Quarry, East Calder, Midlothian.\r\n\r\n1. Burdiehouse Limestone; 2. Shales; 3. Diabase.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBosses.--The rounded, oval or irregularly shaped masses of igneous rock\r\nincluded under this head are found in some cases to be only denuded\r\ndomes of sills, as, for example, in the apparently isolated patches\r\nin the oil-shale district of Linlithgowshire, which have been found\r\nto unite under ground. (Compare Fig. 157). In other instances, bosses\r\npossibly, or almost certainly, mark the position of volcanic funnels,\r\nas at the Castle Rock of Edinburgh, Dunearn Hill, Burntisland, and\r\nGalabraes, near Bathgate. But many examples occur which can only be\r\nregarded as the exposed ends of irregular bodies of molten material\r\nwhich has been protruded upwards into the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--Side of columnar basalt-dyke in the same\r\nagglomerate as in Fig. 166.] Carboniferous formations. The area\r\nbetween Edinburgh and Linlithgow and the hills of the north of Fife\r\nfurnish many examples.\r\n\r\nThe connection between bosses and intrusive sheets is instructively\r\nexhibited in a railway cutting to the west of Edinburgh, where the\r\nsection shown in Fig. 167 may be seen. In the space of a few yards\r\nno fewer than four distinct bands of diabase traverse the shale,\r\nthickening rapidly in one direction and uniting with a large boss of\r\nmore coarsely crystalline material. Such connections must exist in\r\nall sills, for the material injected as a sheet between stratified\r\nformations cannot but be united to some column, dyke or irregular\r\nprotrusion which descends to the parent magma in the interior. But it\r\nis very rarely that the geologist is permitted to see them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Dyke rising through the Hurlet Limestone and\r\nits overlying shales. Silvermine Quarry, Linlithgowshire.]\r\n\r\nDykes take a comparatively unimportant place in the eruptive phenomena\r\nof the puys. They occur in some numbers, but on a small scale, among\r\nthe tuff vents, and there they can without much hesitation be set down\r\nas part of the phenomena of eruption through these pipes. The Binn\r\nof Burntisland, which has been so often referred to in this Chapter,\r\nmay again be cited as a typical vent for the display of this series\r\nof dykes (Figs. 149 and 159). Two additional illustrations from this\r\nlocality are here given. In Fig. 166 a dyke of compact black basalt is\r\nseen on the right hand running up the steep slopes of the agglomerate.\r\nSome of these dykes are distinctly columnar, the columns diverging from\r\nthe walls on each side. Where the encasing agglomerate has been removed\r\nby the weather, the side of the dyke presents a reticulated network of\r\nprism-ends. A narrow basalt-dyke of this character near the top of the\r\nBinn vent is represented in Fig. 168.\r\n\r\nBut dykes also occur apart from vents and without any apparent relation\r\nto these. They are sometimes associated with sills and bosses in such a\r\nmanner as to suggest that the whole of these forms of injected material\r\nbelong to one connected series of intrusions. Among the Bathgate Hills,\r\nfor example, from which I have already cited instances of sills and\r\na boss, the section represented in Fig. 169 occurs. Yet in this same\r\ndistrict there is a group of large east and west dykes which cut all\r\nthe other rocks including the bedded lavas and tuffs, and must be of\r\nlater date than the highest part of the Coal-measures (Fig. 155).\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain the age of the dykes which rise through\r\nthe Carboniferous formations at a distance from any interbedded sheets\r\nof lava and tuff, or from any recognizable vent. The south-east and\r\nnorth-west dykes, increasing in number as they go westward, and\r\nattaining a prodigious development in the great volcanic area of Antrim\r\nand the Inner Hebrides, are probably of Tertiary date.[475] Others may\r\npossibly be Permian, while a certain number may reasonably be looked\r\nupon as Carboniferous. In petrographical characters the latter resemble\r\nthe dolerites and basalts (diabases) of the finer-grained sills.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: These are fully described in Chapters xxxiv. and xxxv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PUYS OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n  The Basin of the Firth of Forth--North Ayrshire--Liddesdale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough many of the geological details of each of the Scottish districts\r\nof Puys have been given in the foregoing pages, it will be of advantage\r\nto describe in connected sequence the structure and geological history\r\nof a few typical areas. By far the fullest and most varied record of\r\nthis phase of volcanic activity has been preserved in the basin of\r\nthe Firth of Forth; but the north of Ayrshire and the district of\r\nLiddesdale furnish also many interesting characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BASIN OF THE FIRTH OF FORTH\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the remarkable peculiarity in the\r\ndevelopment of the lower part of the Carboniferous system in this\r\ndistrict.[476] Elsewhere throughout Scotland the Cement-stone group\r\nand the plateau lavas are immediately overlain by the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series. But in the basin of the Firth of Forth a varied\r\nsuccession of strata, more than 3000 feet in thickness, intervenes\r\nbetween the Cement-stones and the Hurlet Limestone. The lower portion\r\nof this thick mass of sediment may represent a part of the Cement-stone\r\ngroup of other districts, but even if some deduction is made on this\r\naccount there remain many hundred feet of stratified deposits, for\r\nwhich there does not appear to be any stratigraphical equivalent\r\nelsewhere in Scotland. The distinguishing features of this series of\r\nstrata are the thick zones of white sandstone, with occasional bands\r\nof fine conglomerate, the abundant seams of dark shale, often highly\r\ncarbonaceous (oil-shales), the cyprid limestones and the seams of coal.\r\nSuch an association of deposits may indicate a more humid climate and\r\nmore varied conditions of denudation and deposition than are presented\r\nby the typical Cement-stones. The muddy floor of the shallow water\r\nmust, in many places, have supported a luxuriant growth of vegetation,\r\nwhich is preserved in occasional seams and streaks of coal. Numerous\r\nepiphytic ferns grew on the subærial stems and branches of the\r\nlycopodiaceous trees. Large coniferae clothed the higher grounds, from\r\nwhich the streams brought down copious supplies of sediment, and whence\r\na flood now and then transported huge prostrate trunks of pine. In\r\nthe lagoons animal life abounded. Cyprids swarmed to such a degree as\r\nto form by their accumulated remains bands of limestone, which in the\r\nwell-known Burdiehouse seam sometimes attain a thickness of 70 feet.\r\nFishes of many genera haunted the waters, for their scales, bones and\r\ncoprolites are found in profusion among the shales and limestones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: See Maclaren's \"Geology of Fife and the Lothians,\" the\r\n_Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Scotland_, on Sheets 31 and 32,\r\nand my Memoir, already cited, _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxix.\r\n(1879) p. 437.]\r\n\r\nWhen the puys began their activity, this district was gradually\r\ndotted over with little volcanic cones. At the same time it was\r\naffected by the general movement of slow subsidence which embraced all\r\nCentral Scotland. Cone after cone, more or less effaced by the waters\r\nwhich closed over it, was carried down and buried under the growing\r\naccumulation of sediment. New vents, however, continued to be opened\r\nelsewhere, throwing out for a time their showers of dust and stones,\r\nand then lapsing into quiescence as they sank into the lagoon. Two\r\ngroups of volcanoes emitted streams of lava and built up two long\r\nvolcanic ridges--those of Fife and West Lothian.\r\n\r\nThe occasional presence of the sea over the area is well shown by\r\nthe occurrence of thin bands of limestone or shale, containing such\r\nfossils as species of _Orthoceras_, _Bellerophon_ and _Discina_, which\r\nsuffice to prove the strata to be stratigraphical equivalents of the\r\nLower Limestone shale, and part of the Carboniferous Limestone of\r\nEngland (Fig. 170). Yet the general estuarine or freshwater character\r\nof the accumulations seems satisfactorily established, not only by the\r\nabsence of undoubtedly marine forms from most of the strata, but by\r\nthe abundance of cyprids and small ganoids, the profusion of vegetable\r\nremains, and the occasional seams of coal.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Forth basin within which the puys are displayed\r\nextends from near Leven in Fife, on the north, to Crosswood Burn near\r\nthe borders of Lanarkshire, on the south, a distance of about 36\r\nmiles, and from near Culross in Fife and the line of the Almond River\r\nbetween Stirlingshire and Linlithgowshire, on the west, to the island\r\nof Inchkeith on the east, a distance of about 16 miles (Map IV.). But\r\nthese limits do not precisely mark the original boundaries of the\r\neruptions. To the north and south, indeed, we can trace the gradual\r\ndying out of the volcanic intercalations, until we reach ground over\r\nwhich no trace of either lavas or tuffs can be detected. To the east,\r\nthe waters of the Firth conceal the geology of a considerable area,\r\nthe island of Inchkeith with its bedded lavas and tuffs showing that\r\nthese rocks extend some way farther eastwards than the position of\r\nthat island. But in Midlothian there is no evidence that any of the\r\npuy-eruptions took place to the east of the line of the Pentland Hills.\r\nOn the west side, the volcanic rocks dip under the Millstone Grit and\r\nCoal-measures, so that we do not know how far they extend in that\r\ndirection. But as the Carboniferous Limestone series, when it rises\r\nagain to the surface on the west side of the Stirlingshire coal-field,\r\nis destitute of included lavas and tuffs, the westward limit of the\r\neruptions cannot lie much beyond the line of the River\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Junction of amygdaloidal basalt with shales\r\nand limestone, Shore, half a mile east from Kinghorn, Fife. (From a\r\nphotograph by Mr. R. Lunn.)] Almond. We shall probably be within the\r\nmark if we set down the original area over which puys broke out and\r\nspread abroad their lavas and tuffs as covering about 300 square miles\r\nof the lagoons and jungles of Central Scotland.\r\n\r\nI have already shown that the range in geological time of the\r\npuy-eruptions in this district extends from a low horizon among the\r\nCalciferous Sandstones through the Carboniferous Limestone series, up\r\nto nearly the level of the Calmy Limestone, which lies not far from the\r\ntop of that series. The vertical thickness of strata between these two\r\nstratigraphical limits, when there are no intercalated volcanic rocks,\r\nis probably more than 4000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe vents from which the volcanic materials were ejected, so far as\r\nthey are now to be observed at the surface, may be divided into two\r\ngroups, one lying to the north, the other to the south of the Firth of\r\nForth. The northern or Fife group may be followed over an area 15 miles\r\nlong, and about three miles broad. Some fifteen separate vents may be\r\nrecognized in it, distributed chiefly at the two ends of the belt, a\r\ncluster of about six rising around Burntisland, while another of nearly\r\nas many appears at Saline. The characters of some of these necks have\r\nbeen already given in the foregoing pages.\r\n\r\nThe southern or West Lothian group includes about a dozen vents which\r\nare scattered over an area of some 60 square miles, extending from\r\nthe coast-line between Borrowstounness and Queensferry southwards to\r\nBathgate and Uphall. In this group Binns Hill, a mile long by almost\r\nhalf a mile broad, and rising to a height of nearly 300 feet above the\r\nsea, forms the most prominent individual. But the vents are generally\r\nsmaller in the southern than in the northern group.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the vents have been left filled with volcanic\r\nmaterial has been described in previous pages. Most of them are\r\noccupied by tuff or agglomerate. In many cases the neck consists\r\nentirely of pyroclastic detritus, as in most of the vents of eastern\r\nLinlithgowshire and many of those in Fife. Not infrequently a column of\r\nbasalt has risen in the funnel and solidified there, as exemplified by\r\nBinns Hill and Saline Hill, or the basalt has filled rents in the tuff\r\nand now appears in dykes like those on the Binn of Burntisland (Figs.\r\n148, 149, 159, 166, 168).\r\n\r\nBut it is possible that in some cases vents may be represented by\r\nbosses of basalt or dolerite, unaccompanied by any agglomerate or\r\ntuff. Perhaps the best example of this suggested origin is supplied\r\nby Galabraes Hill, which rises through the Hurlet limestone and the\r\nvolcanic series of the Bathgate Hills, about a mile north-east from the\r\ntown of Bathgate. This eminence rises to a height of 940 feet above\r\nthe sea, and consists of a rudely elliptical boss of basalt, measuring\r\n3500 feet in its greater and 3000 feet in its minor axis. It disrupts\r\nthe sedimentary and volcanic series, which can be traced up to it\r\non all sides. Some of the smaller circular or elliptical bosses in\r\neastern Linlithgowshire and western Fife may perhaps belong to the same\r\ncategory. But undoubtedly most of the intrusive basalts and dolerites\r\nof this volcanic region are sills.\r\n\r\nOver the greater part of the district, only fine tuffs were ejected.\r\nThese occur as interstratifications among the ordinary sediments,\r\nand vary from mere thin partings, marking the feeblest and briefest\r\nexplosions, up to continuous accumulations several hundred feet thick.\r\nAs an example of the least vigorous emission of tuff I may refer to\r\nthe sections already given on pp. 437, 438. The thicker bands are well\r\nillustrated by that which lies some way above the Houston Coal, between\r\nDrumcross and West Broadlaw in Linlithgowshire, and by the great mass\r\nof tuff which occurs immediately below the Calmy Limestone on the River\r\nAvon near Linlithgow Bridge, and which may be 300 feet thick.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking characteristic of the tuffs that they may be met with\r\nin their solitary beds intercalated in the midst of ordinary sediments\r\nat a distance from any other trace of volcanic activity, their parent\r\nvents not being visible. I may cite in illustration an interesting case\r\nin the Swear Burn, near the southern end of the volcanic district.\r\nA band of tuff about ten feet thick lies there intercalated in a\r\ngroup of dark shales and thin coals. Below it there is a seam of\r\ncoal four inches thick, and among the blue shales overlying it is\r\nanother coal ten inches thick. The tuff is pale green, almost white\r\nin colour, fine in texture, like a volcanic mud, while some of its\r\ncomponent beds, one foot in thickness, are made up of fine laminæ and\r\nare even false-bedded. We might infer that the volcanic vent lay at\r\nsome distance, so that only the finest dust fell over the swamps in\r\nwhich the coal-vegetation was accumulating, but for the presence of\r\noccasional blocks of basalt one foot in diameter scattered through the\r\ntuff. When the eruptions ceased, the deposition of ordinary mud and\r\nthe accumulation of plant-remains went on as before, and animal life\r\ncrowded in again over the spot, for between the partings of the coal\r\nabove the tuff, abundant fragments of eurypterids and scorpions may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive volcanic discharges of fragmentary material\r\nwas that which produced the \"Houston marls\" already referred to.\r\nThese strata appear to mark a peculiar phase in the volcanic history\r\nof the Lower Carboniferous rocks of the Firth of Forth, when\r\nexceedingly fine ash, or perhaps even volcanic mud, was erupted in\r\nconsiderable quantity. The \"marls\" attain in some places a thickness\r\nof nearly 200 feet, and can be traced through most of the eastern\r\npart of Linlithgowshire, over an area of perhaps more than 50 square\r\nmiles. This volcanic platform, which has been followed in mining for\r\noil-shale, is one of the most extensive among the puy-eruptions.\r\nThe material, which probably came from one or more vents among the\r\nBathgate Hills, is not always of equal fineness, but passes into and\r\neven alternates with ordinary granular tuff. Thus in the Niddry Burn,\r\nabove Ecclesmachan, the dull sage-green and brownish red Houston marls\r\ncontain a few inconstant layers of green tuff, in which may be noticed\r\npieces of black shale and lapilli of the usual basic pumice. Not far\r\nto the west, beyond Wester Ochiltree, and thus probably nearer to the\r\nactive vents that ejected the dust and ashes, the Houston marls are\r\nreplaced by or include a bedded granular tuff or basalt-agglomerate,\r\nwhich lies above the 2-feet coal of the district. The matrix of this\r\nrock is in part a dull green granular mudstone, wrapping round the\r\nlapilli and ejected stones, which, when they fall out under the action\r\nof the weather, leave casts of their forms behind them. The enclosed\r\nfragments vary in size up to blocks three feet in diameter, and consist\r\nin great measure of a compact volcanic grit, composed of a fine mud\r\nmixed with minute fragments of black shale, grains of sand and flakes\r\nof mica. There are likewise blocks of cement-stone and shale. Thin\r\ncourses of black shale interlaminated with the tuff show its bedding.\r\n\r\nThe thickest and most continuous accumulations of tuff occur round some\r\nof the larger tuff cones, particularly round the Saline Hills, and in\r\nthe Burntisland district. In the first-named area the copious eruptions\r\nof fragmentary material brought the volcanic history there to an end;\r\nbut around Burntisland they were only the prelude to a prolonged and\r\nvaried series of discharges.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that in the area of the puys of the\r\nForth-basin, while the majority of the vents were tuff-cones, and\r\nemitted only fragmentary discharges, there were two well-marked tracts\r\nwhere lavas were poured out extensively and during a long geological\r\ninterval. One of those lies in the southern, the other in the northern\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe southern or Linlithgowshire lava-ridge forms now what are known as\r\nthe Bathgate and Linlithgow Hills. The lavas extend for about 14 miles\r\nfrom north to south, dying out in both directions, while their present\r\nvisible breadth is about three miles at its widest part. The highest\r\nsummit reaches a height of about 1000 feet above the sea. The structure\r\nof this long ridge reveals an interesting record of volcanic eruptions.\r\nIt consists mainly of sheets of basalt, sometimes separated by layers\r\nof tuff (Fig. 155). But on one or two horizons the volcanic rocks\r\ncease, and ordinary sedimentary deposits take their place. As has been\r\nalready stated, the Main or Hurlet Limestone can be traced through the\r\nheart of the volcanic masses. This seam attains there an exceptional\r\nthickness of as much as 70 to 80 feet, and is nowhere more abundantly\r\nfossiliferous. During its deposition there seems to have been a\r\nsubsidence of the area, together with a cessation of volcanic activity\r\nfor a time. The crinoids, corals, brachiopods, bryozoa, lamellibranchs,\r\ngasteropods, cephalopods and fishes, which swarmed in the clear water,\r\nbuilt up a thick calcareous layer above the lavas and tuffs of the\r\nsea-bottom.\r\n\r\nAmong the sandstones and shales that cover the limestone, bands\r\nof tuff make their appearance, indicating the renewal of volcanic\r\nactivity. These are immediately surmounted by another thick pile of\r\nbasalt-sheets. Subsequently, during pauses in the eruptions, while the\r\ngeneral subsidence continued, renewed deposits of sediment spread over\r\nthe submerged volcanic bank. One of the longest periods of quiescence\r\nwas that during which the coals and even the Index Limestone of\r\nBathgate crept northwards over the sunken lavas and tuffs. But the\r\nwhole of the ridge does not seem to have disappeared at that time under\r\nwater, at least these intercalated strata have not been traced across\r\nthe thick pile of volcanic material near Linlithgow. During the final\r\nperiod of eruption, the outpouring of lava and discharge of ashes,\r\nneither in united thickness nor in horizontal extent, equalled those\r\nwhich had preceded them. When the volcanoes ceased their activity, the\r\narea continued to sink, and over the submerged lavas marine organisms\r\ncrowded the sea-floor, so as to build up the Calmy Limestone. After\r\nthat time volcanic action seems to have become extinct in this region,\r\nfor no trace of any intercalated lava or tuff has been detected either\r\nin the overlying Millstone Grit or in the Coal-measures. The total\r\nthickness of rock in the Linlithgowshire volcanic ridge is about 2200\r\nfeet. It will probably not be an exaggeration to place the proportion\r\nof lava and tuff in that depth of material at nearly 2000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe northern or Fifeshire district over which lavas were abundantly\r\nerupted stretches along the coast from Aberdour to Kirkcaldy and inland\r\nto near Lochgelly, as well as seawards to Inchkeith. It may comprise\r\nan area of about 30 square miles. In many respects this is the most\r\nimportant locality in Britain for the study of Carboniferous volcanic\r\nhistory. The sea has cut an admirable coast-section in which the\r\nstructures of the rocks are laid bare. The bottom and top of the whole\r\nvolcanic series can be seen. The vents and their relation to the lavas\r\nand tuffs that were emitted from them may easily be made out; while\r\nthe interstratification of well-known seams of rock in the Scottish\r\nCarboniferous system permits the sequence and chronology of the whole\r\nvolcanic series to be traced with great clearness.\r\n\r\nMost of these features have already been described in foregoing pages,\r\nfor the district is a typical one for the study of Carboniferous\r\nvolcanic phenomena. Thus the group of vents about Burntisland has been\r\nillustrated by the Binn of Burntisland rising among the bedded lavas\r\nand tuffs. The characters of the Carboniferous basalt-sheets have been\r\nenumerated, together with their intercalated layers of tuff and bole,\r\nand their fine partings of ashy material that was thrown out over the\r\nlagoons during the intervals between two outbursts of lava. But it may\r\nbe of service if I insert here a detailed section of the whole volcanic\r\nseries as it is displayed along the coast-section between Burntisland\r\nand Kinghorn. The lowest intercalated lavas of that section lie a\r\nlittle above the horizon of the Burdiehouse Limestone, and are thus\r\nprobably rather earlier than those of Linlithgowshire. The highest\r\nreach up to the base of the Hurlet Limestone. The volcanic energy\r\nmanifestly died out here long before it ceased on the south side of\r\nthe Firth. Yet so vigorous was its activity while it continued, that\r\nit piled up one of the thickest masses of volcanic material anywhere\r\nto be seen among the puy-eruptions of the British Isles. The following\r\ntabular statement of the alternations of material in this great mass\r\nin descending order, was drawn up by me on the ground many years ago,\r\nbefore the construction of fortifications and other changes partly\r\nconcealed the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--Columnar basalt, Pettycur, Kinghorn, Fife.\r\n(From a photograph taken for the Geological Survey by Mr. R.

Reddish and white sandstones.\r\n\r\n  74. Shale with hard ribs of limestone and ironstone nodules.\r\n      Fossils abundant.\r\n\r\n  73. Limestone, crinoidal, 8 or 9 feet.\r\n\r\n  72. Blue shale, becoming calcareous towards the top, where shells\r\n      are plentiful.\r\n\r\n  71. Reddish false-bedded sandstones, with bands of reddish and blue\r\n      shale.\r\n\r\n  70. Basalt in two sills separated by 2 or 3 feet of sandstone and\r\n      shale.\r\n\r\n  69. Dark fissile sandy shale, passing up into white shaly\r\n      sandstone, and including a thin parting of impure coal.\r\n\r\n  68. Limestone (Hurlet or Main Seam) in a number of bands having a\r\n      united thickness of 25 feet. Abundant fossils.\r\n\r\n  67. Black shale becoming calcareous at top, and then enclosing\r\n      abundant _Productus_, etc., 8 or 10 feet.\r\n\r\n  66. Red and green tufaceous marl and tuff. About 30 feet.\r\n\r\n  65. Basalt, the lower part strongly amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n  64. Tufaceous red marl and tuff; comparatively coarse below,\r\n      becoming finer above, 3 or 4 feet.\r\n\r\n  63. Basalt, earthy and amygdaloidal, with an irregular bottom\r\n      involving masses of the shales below.\r\n\r\n  62. Dark calcareous shale and dull green tufaceous marly shale, 2\r\n      or 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  61. Crinoidal limestone in several bands with a united thickness of\r\n      10 feet.\r\n\r\n  60. Shale, 1 foot.\r\n\r\n  59. Fine green sandy tuffs in a number of bands of varying\r\n      coarseness, about 6 feet.\r\n\r\n  58. Dark shale with abundance of _Aviculopecten_ immediately under\r\n      the tuffs above, 1½ feet.\r\n\r\n  57. Soft, light, marly shale with fragmentary plants, 1½ feet.\r\n\r\n  56. Dark fissile shale, full of fish-scales, plants, etc., 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  55. Basalt, rudely columnar, dark fine-grained in centre, becoming\r\n      highly amygdaloidal and scoriaceous at bottom and top.\r\n\r\n  54. Basalt, like the sheet above, vesicular at top and bottom, with\r\n      a parting of red clay on top.\r\n\r\n  53. Fissile rippled sandy shale, with plants, having a red and\r\n      green marly parting at the top, 12 or 14 feet.\r\n\r\n  52. Basalts; a group of beds, probably in part sills, involving\r\n      three bands of sandstone or quartzite.\r\n\r\n  51. Quartzite--a hard white altered sandstone, 2 to 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  50. Basalt, light green, earthy, amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n  49. Sandstones and shales with plants, 25 feet.\r\n\r\n  48. Basalt, with a highly amygdaloidal central band. There may be\r\n      several sheets here.\r\n\r\n  47. Green tufaceous shale and marl, 1 foot.\r\n\r\n  46. Basalt, dark, firm and amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n  45. Sandstones and shales with plants.\r\n\r\n  44. Basalt forming west side of Kinghorn Bay, and including more\r\n      than one sheet. The rock is very black, compact, irregularly\r\n      columnar, with the usual amygdaloidal earthy band at the base,\r\n      and forms the crag called the Carlinehead Rocks. An irregular\r\n      and inconstant band of dull green tufaceous shale, sometimes 2\r\n      feet thick, serves to separate two of the basalt-sheets. Below\r\n      it lies a remarkable scoriaceous almost brecciated basalt, which\r\n      has been broken up on cooling in such a manner that at first it\r\n      might be mistaken for a volcanic conglomerate.\r\n\r\n  43. Basalt, a compact black solid rock, with a vesicular and\r\n      amygdaloidal bottom, about 40 feet. This sheet runs out into the\r\n      promontory of Kinghorn Ness.\r\n\r\n  42. Basalt, firm, compact and highly amygdaloidal throughout, 15\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n  41. Basalt, earthy, amygdaloidal and scoriaceous in the upper part,\r\n      compact below.\r\n\r\n  40. Red tufaceous marl, clay or bole, a few inches thick.\r\n\r\n  39. Basalt: one of the most compact sheets of the whole series,\r\n      about 40 feet. The top is formed of a thick zone of scoriaceous\r\n      and brecciated material, the bottom is singularly uneven owing\r\n      to the very irregular surface of the underlying bed.\r\n\r\n  38. Basalt more or less scoriaceous throughout, especially at the\r\n      bottom, the vesicles being drawn out round the slag-like blocks.\r\n\r\n  37. Green tufaceous shales with bands of fine green tuff, 7 to 8\r\n      feet. The lower bands consist of a gravelly tuff passing up into\r\n      a fine volcanic mudstone, with scattered lapilli of basalt an\r\n      inch or more in diameter.\r\n\r\n  36. Basalt, with an upper, earthy and highly amygdaloidal portion,\r\n      30 feet.\r\n\r\n  35. Tufaceous sandstone and shale, 6 to 8 feet.\r\n\r\n  34. Basalt, in a thick bed, having an earthy, slaggy top and a\r\n      scoriaceous bottom.\r\n\r\n  33. Basalt, very slaggy below with a compact centre.\r\n\r\n  32. Basalt, like that below it.\r\n\r\n  31. Basalt, firm, compact, black rock, with a rough, green earthy\r\n      band, from 6 inches to a foot, at the bottom, and becoming again\r\n      very slaggy at the top.\r\n\r\n  30. Green shale like that below the underlying limestone, a few\r\n      inches in thickness.\r\n\r\n  29. Coarse, green, sandy tufaceous limestone, averaging 1 foot in\r\n      thickness.\r\n\r\n  28. Black shale with plants, 12 or 14 feet, becoming green and\r\n      tufaceous at the top.\r\n\r\n  27. Basalt--the most striking of the whole section--a fine compact\r\n      black olivine-bearing rock, beautifully columnar, 30 feet. The\r\n      columns reach to within a foot of the bottom of the bed and\r\n      cease about 10 feet from the top, the upper portion of the bed\r\n      being massive, with vesicles which are drawn out parallel to the\r\n      bedding of the series. The lowest part of the bed is a broken\r\n      brecciated band, 3 or 4 inches thick. (See Fig. 171.)\r\n\r\n  26. Black shale with fragmentary plants, 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  25. Basalt, with plentiful olivine, 12 to 16 feet. The base is not\r\n      highly scoriaceous, but finely vesicular. Towards the top it\r\n      becomes green, earthy and roughly brecciated. It partly cuts out\r\n      the tuff underneath.\r\n\r\n  24. Tuff, green, fine-grained and well-stratified, consisting\r\n      chiefly of fine volcanic dust, but becoming coarser towards the\r\n      top, where it contains lapilli and occasional bombs of highly\r\n      vesicular lavas.\r\n\r\n  23. Black carbonaceous shale, 3 feet; approaching to the character\r\n      of an impure coal in the lower part, and becoming more\r\n      argillaceous above with some thin nodular calcareous bands.\r\n\r\n  22. Green tuff, 12 feet, well stratified and fine-grained, with\r\n      minute lapilli of highly vesicular basic lavas; becomes shaly at\r\n      the bottom.\r\n\r\n  21. Basalt, compact, amygdaloidal, with highly vesicular upper\r\n      surface, 20 feet.\r\n\r\n  20. Basalt, hard, black and full of olivine; an irregular bed 3 to\r\n      6 feet thick.\r\n\r\n  19. Basalt, dull brownish-green to black, full of kernels and\r\n      strings of calcite, and showing harder and softer bands parallel\r\n      with upper and under surfaces, which give it a stratified\r\n      appearance.\r\n\r\n  18. Basalt, some parts irregularly compact, others earthy and\r\n      scoriaceous. The distinguishing feature of this bed is the\r\n      abundance of its enclosed fragments of shale, ironstone and\r\n      limestone, which here and there form half of its bulk. The\r\n      roughly scoriaceous upper portion is especially full of these\r\n      fragments. In the ironstone balls coprolites may be detected,\r\n      and occasional pieces of plant-stems are embedded in the basalt.\r\n      This lava has evidently broken up and involved some of the\r\n      underlying strata over which it flowed. This rock overhangs\r\n      Pettycur Harbour.\r\n\r\n  17. Shales and limestone bands more or less tufaceous, 8 to 10\r\n      feet, with plants, cyprids, etc. The intercalation of fine\r\n      partings of tuff in this band has been already cited on p. 438,\r\n      as an illustration of the feeble intermittent character of many\r\n      of the volcanic explosions between successive outflowings of\r\n      lava.\r\n\r\n      Owing to a change in the direction of strike the rocks now wheel\r\n      round and for a time run nearly parallel with the coast-line,\r\n      while they are partly concealed by blown sand and herbage. The\r\n      shales and limestones just mentioned are not constant, and are\r\n      soon lost, but about a quarter of a mile westward a band of\r\n      tuff begins on the same horizon or near it, and increases in\r\n      thickness towards the west, where it is associated with other\r\n      sediments. The shore ceases to furnish a continuous section,\r\n      so that recourse must be had to the craggy slopes immediately\r\n      to the north, where the rocks can be examined on a cliff face\r\n      (Fig. 153). There the tuff just referred to, together with some\r\n      overlying bands of sandstone, is seen to pass under the group\r\n      of basalts last enumerated. It is a green, stratified rock,\r\n      perhaps 60 feet thick at its maximum, but dying out rapidly\r\n      to north-west and south-east. It encloses balls of basalt and\r\n      subangular and rounded fragments of sandstone, limestone and\r\n      shale. A mass of coarse volcanic agglomerate which is connected\r\n      with it and cuts across the ends of some of the basalts below,\r\n      probably marks the position of the vent from which the tuff was\r\n      ejected (Fig. 152).\r\n\r\n  16. Black and grey shales forming a thin band at the summit of King\r\n      Alexander's Crag.\r\n\r\n  15. Basalt, dark compact rock, with an upper and lower highly\r\n      scoriaceous and amygdaloidal band, 15 feet.\r\n\r\n  14. Black shales, tufaceous green shales, sandstone, and 6 inches\r\n      of coal, forming a group of strata about 12 feet thick between\r\n      two basalts; plants and cyprids abundant. (The coal seam is\r\n      shown in Fig. 151.)\r\n\r\n  13. Basalt, dull, earthy and highly amygdaloidal, with abundant\r\n      calcite in kernels and veins; about 15 feet, but varying in\r\n      thickness.\r\n\r\n  12. Basalt, forming a well-marked bed from 12 to 25 feet thick. It\r\n      is a compact black olivine-bearing rock, sparingly amygdaloidal,\r\n      but showing the usual dull green, earthy scoriform base. The\r\n      upper surface is singularly irregular, having, in flowing,\r\n      broken up into large clinker-like blocks, which are involved\r\n      in the immediately overlying basalt. The bottom also is very\r\n      uneven, for the basalt has in some places cut out the underlying\r\n      shales, so as to rest directly upon the basalt below.\r\n\r\n  11. Black shale, varying up to 6 inches, but sometimes entirely\r\n      removed by the overlying lava-stream.\r\n\r\n  10. Basalt, containing large irregularly spheroidal masses of hard\r\n      black finely vesicular material enclosed in more earthy and\r\n      coarsely vesicular rock. The vesicles are sometimes elongated\r\n      parallel to the bedding, but have often been drawn out round a\r\n      spheroid; some of them measure nearly a foot in length by 2 or\r\n      3 inches in breadth. The upper surface is uneven and coarsely\r\n      amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n  9. Basalt, hard black, with abundant olivine, and a columnar\r\n     structure.\r\n\r\n  8. Green shale, 6 inches to 1 foot, much baked and involved in the\r\n     overlying basalt.\r\n\r\n  7. Basalt, dull-green, earthy, amygdaloidal, varying from 10 to 40\r\n     feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n  6. Blue shale, disappearing where the basalt above it unites with\r\n     that below.\r\n\r\n  5. Basalt with olivine, forming a thick irregular bed, which in\r\n     some places is black and compact, in others green, earthy and\r\n     amygdaloidal. The upper part is particularly cellular.\r\n\r\n  4. Sandstones forming a thick group of beds which have long been\r\n     quarried for building-stone at the Grange and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  3. Black shales.\r\n\r\n  2. Limestone (Burdiehouse).\r\n\r\n  1. Sandstones, shales and thin limestones forming the strata at\r\n     Burntisland through which the sills of that district have been\r\n     injected (Fig. 159).\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of sills are abundantly developed among the Carboniferous\r\nrocks of the basin of the Firth of Forth, and some of the more\r\nremarkable examples in this district have been already cited. Taking\r\nnow a general survey of this part of the volcanic history, I may\r\nobserve that if the sills are for a moment considered simply as they\r\nappear at the surface, and apart from the geological horizons on\r\nwhich they lie, they form a wide ring surrounding the Falkirk and\r\nStirlingshire coal-field.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the Abbey Craig, near Stirling, we may trace this ring as\r\na continuous belt of high ground from Stirling to the River Carron.\r\nThence it splits up into minor masses in different portions of the\r\nCarboniferous system, and doubtless belonging to different periods\r\nof volcanic disturbance, but yet sweeping as a whole across the\r\nnorth-eastern part of the Clyde coal-field, and then circling round\r\ninto Stirlingshire and Linlithgowshire. There are no visible masses\r\nto fill up the portion of the ring back to Abbey Craig. But through\r\nLinlithgowshire and the west of Edinburghshire a number of intrusive\r\nsheets form an eastward prolongation of the ring. Large as some of\r\nthese sheets are at the surface, for they sometimes exceed two or three\r\nsquare miles in area, a much larger portion of their mass is generally\r\nconcealed below ground. Mining operations, for example, have proved\r\nthat in the south-east of Linlithgowshire areas of intrusive rock\r\nwhich appear as detached bosses or bands at the surface are connected\r\nunderneath as portions of one continuous sill, which must be several\r\nsquare miles in extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Section across the Fife band of Sills.\r\n\r\n1. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 2. Calciferous Sandstones; 3. Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series; 4. Millstone Grit; 5. Coal-measures; 6. Dolerite\r\nSills. _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nBut it is in Fife that the sills reach their greatest development among\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks of Scotland (Fig. 172). A nearly continuous\r\nbelt of them runs from the Cult Hill near Saline on the west, to near\r\nSt. Andrews on the east, a distance of about 35 miles. This remarkable\r\nband is connected with a less extensive one, which extends from\r\nTorryburn on the west, to near Kirkcaldy on the east. In two districts\r\nof the Fife region of sills, a connection seems to be traceable between\r\nthe intrusive sheets and volcanic vents, at least groups of necks are\r\nfound in the midst of the sills. One of these districts is that of\r\nthe Saline Hills already described, the other is that of Burntisland.\r\nIn the latter case the evidence is especially striking, for the vents\r\nare connected above with bedded lavas and tuffs, while below lie three\r\nwell-marked sills (Fig. 159).\r\n\r\nIt is certainly worthy of remark that sills are generally absent from\r\nthose areas where no traces of contemporaneous volcanic activity are to\r\nbe found. No contrast in this respect can be stronger than that between\r\nthe ground to the east and west of the old axis of the Pentland Hills.\r\nIn the western district, where the puys are so well displayed, sills\r\nabound, but in the eastern tract both disappear.\r\n\r\nAnother question of importance in dealing with the history of these\r\nsills is their stratigraphical position. By far the larger proportion\r\nof them lies in the Carboniferous Limestone series. Thus the great\r\nsill between Stirling and Kilsyth keeps among the lower parts of that\r\nseries. On the same general horizon are the vast sheets of dolerite\r\nwhich stretch through Fife in the chain of the Cult, Cleish, and Lomond\r\nHills on the one side, and in the eminences from Torryburn to Kinghorn\r\non the other, though the intrusive material sometimes descends almost\r\nto the Old Red Sandstone. In Linlithgowshire and Edinburghshire, as\r\nwell as in the south of Fife, the sills traverse the Calciferous\r\nSandstone groups.\r\n\r\nIf the horizons of the sills furnished any reliable clue to their\r\nage, it might be inferred that the rocks were all intruded during\r\nthe Carboniferous period, and as most of them lie beneath the upper\r\nstratigraphical limit of the puy-eruptions, the further deduction\r\nmight be drawn that they are connected with these eruptions. I have\r\nlittle doubt that in a general sense both conclusions are well-founded.\r\nBut that there are exceptions to the generalization must be frankly\r\nconceded. On close examination it will be observed that the same\r\nintrusive mass sometimes extends from the lower into the upper parts\r\nof the Carboniferous groups. Thus, in the west of Linlithgowshire, a\r\nlarge protrusion which lies upon the Upper Limestones, crosses most of\r\nthe Millstone Grit, and reaches up almost as high as the Coal-measures.\r\nAgain, in Fife, to the east of Loch Leven, a spur of the great Lomond\r\nsill, crossing the Carboniferous limestone, advances southward into\r\nthe coal-field of Kinglassie, In Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire\r\nnumerous large dolerite sheets have invaded the Millstone Grit and\r\nCoal-measures, including even the upper red sandstones, which form the\r\ntop of the Carboniferous system in this region. It is thus obvious that\r\nif the puy-eruptions in the basin of the Forth ceased towards the close\r\nof the deposition of the Carboniferous Limestone series, there must\r\nhave been a subsequent injection of basic lava on a gigantic scale in\r\ncentral Scotland. I shall recur to this subject in Chapter xxxi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--Section across the Upper Volcanic Band of\r\nnorth Ayrshire. Length about four miles.\r\n\r\n  1.

NORTH OF AYRSHIRE\r\n\r\nIn this part of the country another group of puys and their associated\r\ntuffs and lavas may be traced from near Dairy on the west, to near\r\nGalston on the east (Map IV.). The length of the tract is about sixteen\r\nmiles, while its breadth varies from about a furlong to nearly a mile\r\nand a half. I have had occasion to allude to this marked band of\r\nvolcanic materials which here intervenes between the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone and the Coal-measures, and from its position appears to\r\nmark the latest Carboniferous volcanoes. Its component rocks reach a\r\nthickness of sometimes 600 feet, and as they dip southwards under the\r\nCoal-measures, they may extend for some distance in that direction.\r\nThey have been met with in borings sunk through the northern part of\r\nthe Irvine coal-field. Even what of them can be seen at the surface,\r\nin spite of the effects of faults and denudation, shows that they\r\nform one of the most persistent platforms of volcanic rock among the\r\npuy-eruptions of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhere best developed this volcanic band has a zone of tuff at the\r\nbottom, a central and much thicker zone of bedded basalts, and an\r\nupper group of tuffs, on which the Coal-measures rest conformably. A\r\nfew vents, probably connected with it, are to be seen at the surface\r\nbetween Fenwick and Ardrossan. But others have been buried under the\r\nCarboniferous sedimentary rocks, and, as already described, have been\r\ndiscovered in the underground workings for coal and ironstone (p.\r\n434). These mining operations have, indeed, revealed the presence of\r\nfar more volcanic material below ground than would be surmized from\r\nwhat can be seen at the surface. Here and there, thin layers of tuff\r\nappear in brook-sections, indicating what might be conjectured to have\r\nbeen trifling discharges of volcanic material. But the prosecution of\r\nthe ironstone-mining has proved that, at the time when the seam of\r\nBlack-band Ironstone of that district was accumulated, the floor of\r\nthe shallow sea or lagoon where this deposition took place was dotted\r\nover with cones of tuff, in the hollows between which the ferruginous\r\nand other sediments gathered into layers. That seam is in one place\r\nthick and of good quality; yet only a short distance off it is found\r\nto be so mixed with fine tuff as to be worthless, and even to die out\r\naltogether.[478]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: See Explanation of Sheet 22, _Geol. Surv. of Scotland_,\r\npars. 29, 33, 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. LIDDESDALE\r\n\r\nA remarkable development of puys lies in that little-visited tract\r\nof country which stretches from the valleys of the Teviot and Rule\r\nWater south-westwards across the high moorland watershed, and down\r\nLiddesdale. Through this district a zone of bedded olivine-basalts and\r\nassociated tuffs runs in a broken band which, owing to numerous faults\r\nand extensive denudation, covers now only a few scattered patches of\r\nthe site over which it once spread. The geological horizon of this\r\nzone lies in the Calciferous Sandstones, many hundred feet above the\r\nposition of the top of the plateau-lavas (Map IV.).\r\n\r\nSo great an amount of material has been here removed by denudation that\r\nnot only has the volcanic zone been bared away, but the vents which\r\nsupplied its materials have been revealed in the most remarkable manner\r\nover an area some twenty miles long and eight miles broad. Upwards of\r\nforty necks of agglomerate may be seen in this district, rising through\r\nthe Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, and lowest Carboniferous rocks. It\r\nfills the geologist with wonder to meet with those stumps of old\r\nvolcanoes far to the west among the Silurian lowlands, sometimes fully\r\nten miles away from the nearest relic of the bedded lavas connected\r\nwith them.[479] That these vents, though they rose through ground which\r\nat the time of their activity was covered with the volcanic series\r\nof the plateaux, do not belong to that series, but are of younger\r\ndate, has been proved in several cases by Mr. Peach. He has found\r\nthat among the blocks composing their agglomerates, pieces of the\r\nsandstones, fossiliferous limestones and shales of the Cement-stone\r\ngroup, overlying the plateau-lavas, are to be recognized. These vents\r\nwere therefore drilled through some part at least of the Calciferous\r\nSandstones, which are thus shown to have extended across the tract\r\ndotted with vents. After the volcanic activity ceased, fragments of\r\nthese strata tumbled down from the sides into the funnels. Denudation\r\nhas since stripped off the Calciferous Sandstones, but the pieces\r\ndetached from them, and sealed up at a lower level in the agglomerates,\r\nstill remain. Mr. Peach's observations indicate to how considerable\r\nan extent sagging of the walls of these orifices took place, with the\r\nprecipitation not merely of blocks, but of enormous masses of rock,\r\ninto the volcanic chimneys. In one instance, between Tudhope Hill and\r\nAnton Heights, a long neck, or perhaps group of necks, which crosses\r\nthe watershed, shows a mass of the red sandstone many acres in extent,\r\nand large enough to be inserted on the one-inch map, which has fallen\r\ninto the vent (Fig. 175).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: They have been recognized and mapped by Mr. B. N.\r\nPeach for the Geological Survey. See Sheets 11 and 17, _Geol. Surv.\r\nScotland_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--Section showing the connection of the two\r\nvolcanic bands in Liddesdale.\r\n\r\n  1. Upper Silurian strata; 2. Upper Old Red Sandstone; 3.

Agglomerate of the neck\r\nwith andesite intrusion (4).]\r\n\r\nThe materials ejected from the Liddesdale vents include both basaltic\r\nlavas and tuffs. The former are sometimes highly vesicular, especially\r\nalong the upper parts of the flows. They are thickest towards the\r\nnorth, and in Windburgh Hill attain a depth of at least 300 or 400\r\nfeet. In that part of the district they form the lower and main part of\r\nthe volcanic series, being there covered by a group of tuffs. But a few\r\nmiles southwards, not far to the west of Kershopefoot, they die out.\r\nThe tuffs then form the whole of the volcanic band which, intercalated\r\nin a well-marked group of limestones, can be followed across the moors\r\nfor some six miles into the valley of the Esk, where an interesting\r\nsection of them and of the associated limestone and shales is exposed\r\n(Fig. 174). At Kershopefoot, a higher band of basic lava overlies the\r\nKershopefoot limestone, and can be traced in scattered patches both on\r\nthe Scottish and English side of the Border.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
