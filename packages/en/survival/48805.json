I. PHILADELPHIA, _Eleventh Month, 1820_. _No. 11._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen casting around for topics, to which the attention of my readers\r\nmay be solicited, they sometimes start up in almost every quarter;\r\nand the principal difficulty arises in the task of selection. It is,\r\nhowever, altogether probable, that like the young lady, who after\r\ndisregarding the pretensions of men of sense and merit, at length\r\ngives her hand to some empty-pated coxcomb, my final determination\r\nmay not always furnish the most conclusive evidence of wisdom or\r\ncorrect taste. Notwithstanding this may be the case, it is possible\r\nthat here and there, at distant intervals, something may be found\r\nfrom which improvement may be derived by those who are in pursuit of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, the attention of my little circle is\r\nrespectfully invited to a few of the occurrences of the passing\r\nyear. We are now approaching the confines of winter, that season\r\nwhich has been called with great propriety its old age. Previously\r\nto its commencement, and during the continuance of what in this\r\ncountry is called Indian Summer, the face of nature is expressive\r\nof pleasing melancholy; the sun divested of his ordinary radiance,\r\ncourts our gaze--the prevailing stillness is only invaded by the\r\nfalling leaf--and every phasis in which we behold her, is serene\r\nand tranquil. At such a period we are led into a train of sober\r\nand rational reflection; and for a moment, feel wisely disposed\r\nto appropriate to our advantage, the truths which it reveals. In\r\ncontemplating the progress of decay, and witnessing the beauties\r\nwith which we are surrounded, successfully fading before our eyes,\r\nwe are forcibly reminded of the solemn fact, that human life, with\r\nall its sublunary enjoyments, is also rapidly hastening to the tomb.\r\nWe in some degree become familiar with the image of dissolution; and\r\nthe departure of those of our friends and acquaintances, who have\r\nduring the past months joined \"the immense majority of the dead,\" is\r\nby the power of association brought to our remembrance. Most of them\r\nentered on the present year full of life and hope, and had every\r\nprospect of outliving many who are now their survivors; but alas!\r\nhow vague and uncertain are all human calculations. The past summer\r\nand autumn, have in many parts of our otherwise highly favoured\r\ncountry, been accompanied with FEVER in its various appalling forms;\r\nand numerous have been the victims to this minister of death. Our\r\nown metropolis was for some time the seat of painful apprehension,\r\nand no one could doubt the presence of a most malignant visiter,\r\nwhose footsteps were, however, mercifully arrested by an overruling\r\nhand. NEW-ORLEANS and SAVANNAH have experienced more weighty and\r\ntremendous affliction from this source; and the sufferings of their\r\ninhabitants claim our deep and sincere sympathy. Many of the laws\r\nof nature are still concealed from our observation; but it is our\r\nduty to collect authentic facts, to reason from what we know, so\r\nthat in some instances we may ascend from effects to their causes.\r\n_It is certainly the part of wisdom, in relation to_ YELLOW FEVER,\r\n_to guard with vigilance every supposed avenue of approach, whether\r\ndomestic or foreign_. The season has been remarkable in many\r\nrespects. The earth has been unusually fruitful of her productions:\r\nthe crops of bread-stuffs, and vegetables of every description,\r\nhave been almost unprecedented.--Apples were never known to be so\r\nabundant and cheap. It may not moreover be altogether unworthy of\r\nremark, that myriads of musquitoes have for many weeks past been our\r\nunwelcome guests. Whether there be any necessary connexion between\r\nthese circumstances or not, and in what manner it exists, is the\r\nproper business of philosophy to inquire, and if possible determine.\r\n\r\nAmong the events which have recently passed in review before us of\r\nPennsylvania, although we disclaim the character of politicians, the\r\nrecent general election could not have been entirely a matter of\r\nindifference. But whether the election of a GOVERNOR, conducted as\r\nit is here with an inordinate excitement of all the angry passions,\r\nbe promotive of the great moral interests of society, is at least\r\nquestionable. Peaceable citizens very naturally keep aloof from\r\nsuch a conflict; and from this circumstance alone, the commonwealth\r\nsustains great loss. Whether the immense patronage and influence\r\nof that important office could not be so lessened, by a partial\r\ndistribution among other public functionaries, without impairing\r\nits essential dignity and usefulness; and in this way the constant\r\nrecurrence of such disreputable spectacles be obviated as that we\r\nhave recently witnessed, is certainly a question of great moment to\r\nthe tranquillity and character of the state.\r\n\r\nBelonging as we do to the great family of man, we cannot glance\r\nacross the Atlantic at the important transactions of that region,\r\nwithout feeling an interest of no ordinary kind. Reference is here\r\nparticularly made to the bloodless revolutions of Spain, Naples,\r\nand Portugal. We are hostile to the spirit of revolution, as such,\r\nbut the character of these is well fitted to excite our \"special\r\nwonder.\" And it is anxiously to be desired, that the welfare of the\r\npeople of those countries may have been substantially promoted by\r\nthem; for it ought to be remembered, that governments are instituted\r\nfor the good of the whole, and not exclusively for the benefit of\r\npriests and kings. As Christians and patriots, we may on this\r\nsubject be permitted to entertain such wishes as these.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Great Britain, few of us can advert to what is there\r\ntranspiring at present, in relation to royalty, without blushing for\r\nthe land of our fathers;--the land of NEWTON and LOCKE, of MILTON,\r\nof YOUNG, and of COWPER. The drama referred to, disgraceful as it\r\nis, is nevertheless fruitful of salutary lessons. Of these it may be\r\nobserved, this is not the least striking and important, that however\r\nelevated station may be, it is still accessible to the consequences\r\nof guilt; and its occupant may be made to tremble at their approach.\r\nWe may also derive from its incidents, an argument in favour of\r\nour own form of government, comparatively simple and unimposing\r\nas it is in its structure; but not less efficient with respect\r\nto the legitimate objects of government, without which, properly\r\nadministered, the fabric of society would crumble into ruins, and\r\nlawless violence usurp the seat of order and justice. ☞\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning during the present autumn, I made an early excursion\r\nthrough the fields. The sky was unclouded, and the eastern horizon\r\nwas in a glow with those saffron hues that usher in the day. The\r\nstream before me, unruffled by a breath of air, gave back the shape\r\nand colour of the landscape as distinctly as in a mirror. A few\r\nchirping insects, and now and then a warble, sometimes half heard\r\nfrom a distant grove, and sometimes bursting full upon the ear,\r\nwere all that broke the silence.\r\n\r\nCaptivated and riveted by the scene, I sat down under a favourite\r\nbeech-tree, to enjoy it at my leisure. In such situations, the mind\r\nnaturally falls into that train of musing which is most habitual;\r\nand I was soon lost in meditations upon the inexhaustible beauty\r\nand magnificence of Nature, and those lessons of deep philosophy\r\nwhich are to be learned in its school. From one thought I passed to\r\nanother, till insensibly I fell into the following revery.\r\n\r\nMethought that beside me was a hill, whose rocky sides seemed\r\nalmost inaccessible. The ascent was somewhat easier near the top,\r\nwhich glowed as if it were on fire. Before the hill was a fertile\r\nand beautiful plain, which was terminated by a barren heath, and\r\nthat, by the waters of a vast lake. A path, the beginning of which\r\nI could not discover, seemed to wind round the foot of the hill,\r\ntill it came to where there was somewhat of an opening in rocks, and\r\ndivided. One part took the direction of the plain, and was soon lost\r\nin innumerable avenues. The other ascended the hill, in nearly a\r\nstraight direction to the summit.\r\n\r\nWhere the path divided, there were stationed two beings of a\r\ncelestial appearance. One of them, who guarded the ascent to the\r\nhill, was a youth of severe but manly beauty.\r\n\r\nA female stood at the entrance to the plain. She was elegantly\r\nthough loosely dressed; her head was crowned with a chaplet of\r\nflowers, and her whole contour was that of perfect beauty--yet there\r\nwas a certain boldness and forwardness in her mien, that however\r\nit might captivate some, rather checked the advances of those whose\r\nself-command was not disarmed by her beauty.\r\n\r\nI perceived a crowd of persons advancing along the great road,\r\ntowards these beings; and when they came to where it forked, they\r\nseemed urged forward by an irresistible impulse, yet doubtful which\r\npath to pursue. Many attempted to ascend the hill, allured no doubt\r\nby the splendour of its summit. Yet I observed that the greater part\r\nof these, after toiling a little way up the ascent, turned back,\r\nafter many a wistful look at the valley which lay behind them. The\r\ngreater part of the travellers, however, chose the direction of the\r\nvalley. Some were allured by the sight of verdant banks and shady\r\ngroves, and by the strains of exquisite melody ever and anon wafted\r\nto their ears.\r\n\r\nMany were enticed by the Portress of the Plain, who assured them\r\nthat there was a much easier and pleasanter way to the summit of the\r\nhill through her dominions. When they had once entered, it seemed\r\nlike a region of enchantment. The main path, as I have mentioned,\r\nspeedily lost itself in innumerable branches.--Many of these seemed\r\nto wind along the foot of the hill, so that the travellers easily\r\npersuaded themselves that they would soon find the road which the\r\nGenius had promised, and pitied the ascetic toil of those who were\r\nscaling the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe inducements to repose, and the pleasures by the wayside, were,\r\nhowever, innumerable. Here a flower of uncommon beauty solicited\r\ntheir admiration, while umbrageous retreats and cooling fountains,\r\npresented themselves at every turn. Beings of celestial beauty were\r\nloitering in the shade--willing to be caressed, and ever ready\r\nto beguile the way with music and song. At one time they would\r\ninvite the pilgrims to taste the golden fruits, which hung from the\r\nbranches; or to listen to the melody of some songster of the grove.\r\nAt another they would join in the wanton dance, \"to the warbling of\r\nthe lascivious lute,\" and lull their senses into oblivion with music\r\nlike that of Circe. Every sense was gratified; the sky was serene\r\nand brilliant, the landscape in its summer beauty, and the breeze\r\nwas loaded with fragrance and melody.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the paths lost their former direction, and all tended\r\ntowards the end of the plain. I could see that the sirens, who so\r\nfatally beguiled the way, kept aloof from this part of the valley,\r\nand lingered among the cool and shady retreats at the entrance.\r\nYet the travellers seemed, as before, urged on by an irresistible\r\nimpulse; although, as they advanced, the way became less pleasant,\r\nthe groves and the flowers less frequent and luxuriant, and the\r\nmelody of the birds less enchanting. The sun now shone with\r\nintolerable ardour, and the plain ended in a burning sandy desert,\r\ntrackless and unwatered. The few sirens who still accompanied them,\r\nand who were before so irresistibly charming, lost by degrees their\r\nyouth and beauty. A few withered hags were all that now remained.\r\nThe lute and the myrtle wreath were exchanged for a whip of snakes\r\nand a dagger. With these they chased the band of miserable bloated\r\nwretches, urging them farther and farther from the last vestige of\r\ndelight. I could see a number of winged boys, flying about, and\r\narmed with a bow and a quiver of arrows. They discharged their\r\nweapons at random, among the deluded travellers on the plain.--Their\r\nshafts most frequently fell blunted to the ground. But whomsoever\r\nthey pierced, seemed roused as from a dream. The flowers, for them,\r\nlost their fragrancy, the song of the grove its music, and the banks\r\ntheir verdure. The sun burnt with tenfold rage, and they gazed on\r\nthemselves and their companions with horror. Many of them turned\r\nand fled, and though they were pursued by the taunts and hisses of\r\nthose around them, seldom stopped until they had gained the foot\r\nof the mountain. But the greater number tore the darts wildly from\r\ntheir bosoms, and pressed on more desperately than before. The\r\nwound, for a time, would appear to be healed. But whenever they\r\nwere struck with the lashes of their pursuers, it opened again--a\r\nrankling and incurable sore. At every step their torment increased.\r\nFrantic and blaspheming, they hurried on towards the end of the\r\ndesert, where a grove of blasted cedars seemed to promise shade,\r\nand the sound of waters, refreshment. But scarcely had they gained\r\nthe bank, when the billows rolled over them, and closed for ever.\r\nThe howling of the winds, the dashing of the waves, and the shrieks\r\nof the dying, sent horror to my soul.--I turned with pain from the\r\nprospect to observe those who were ascending the mountain. They\r\nseemed at first to advance with difficulty, for the ascent of the\r\nhill was steep and rocky. There was but one path to its summit, and\r\nthis kept nearly a direct course, and seldom bent itself to the\r\ninequalities of the way. The travellers often stumbled over the\r\nstones that obstructed the passage, or tore themselves with the\r\nbriars that trailed along the way. Sometimes they would unexpectedly\r\nfind themselves at the foot of a rock that hid the prospect before\r\nthem, and seemed to bar up the passage.--But an attentive observer\r\nmight discover along its side a steep and hazardous, yet accessible\r\npath. Here all their vigour and caution was requisite; and when they\r\nhad gained the top, it was often only to discover new difficulties.\r\nSuch were the obstacles, that many became disheartened, and sighed\r\nafter and sought the voluptuous delights of the plain. The air on\r\nthe mountain was cool and damp, and often overcast with clouds. Yet\r\nthe thunder seldom rolled but at a distance, and the lightnings\r\nplayed innoxiously away. The ground was stony and barren, and seemed\r\nlike a rude and desolate rock. Yet clusters of wild thyme, and\r\nchamomile, and rosemary, grew among the crevices of the stones; and\r\nshed around their sweet, though wholesome and refreshing perfumes.\r\nI observed several beings of a mild and majestic appearance, who\r\nwent about removing and lessening the obstructions of the way. They\r\nraised and strengthened those who had fallen, and encouraged the\r\nlaggard and the slothful. They cheered their labours with the tale\r\nof mighty men of old, or bade them mark the beauties before them,\r\nand the dazzling brilliancy of the summit. Whether it was from the\r\ninvigorating effects of the climate, or the zeal and confidence with\r\nwhich such discourse inspired them, the travellers seemed to gather\r\nfresh strength as they proceeded. Their countenances beamed with\r\ncheerfulness and hope, and they bounded over the obstacles in the\r\npath with alacrity and vigour. A transient gloom would sometimes\r\ncloud their features, and they would sometimes complain of the\r\nasperities of the way. But a glance at the radiance above, or a\r\nsmile from the good Genii who accompanied them, would always restore\r\ntheir wonted cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the summit, the road became more smooth and\r\npleasant; the rude unsightly rock was exchanged for groves and\r\nfields of verdure. The air was purer, and more transparent. The\r\nlandscape around was Nature in her sweetest robe: arrayed not in\r\nthe unripened beauties of spring, or the gorgeous magnificence of\r\nsummer, it breathed the tempered lustre, the full maturity, the\r\nmild undazzling serenity of autumn. The thrush, the robin, and the\r\nturtle-dove, were heard from the recesses of the grove; and the\r\nsky-lark sent down his melody from on high. Violets, jessamines,\r\nand honey-suckles, were scattered along the green, and wasted their\r\nsweets abroad. The radiance from the summit diffused a genial warmth\r\naround, and the travellers seemed already to enjoy the fruition\r\nof their labours,--But as if conscious that greater felicity\r\nwas in view, they still pressed forward till I could scarcely\r\ndistinguish them through the splendour that enveloped the top of the\r\nmountain.--As I was attentively gazing on their progress, methought\r\nI could discover a magnificent temple amidst the blaze of glory. The\r\ndome, the walls, and the pillars, shone like diamond through the\r\nmountain crystal. In the midst of the hall I could faintly trace an\r\naltar smoking with incense. The porticos and the area of the temple\r\nwere crowded with beings of celestial beauty. Their robes were purer\r\nthan the driven snow, and their locks were interwoven with gold and\r\namaranth. Some were watching the rolling incense from the altar, and\r\nsome were hymning the praises of their heavenly guide, or chanting\r\nthe deeds of heroes. Others welcomed the travellers as they arrived,\r\nand led them rejoicing to the midst of the temple.\r\n\r\nMy sight, dazzled and overpowered, could behold them no longer.--The\r\nshout of welcome, the song of triumph, and the holy anthem, mellowed\r\nand softened by the distance, died sweetly away on my ear. \"Happy\r\nregions!\" exclaimed I, \"this is indeed the abode of felicity. A\r\nthousand deaths, ten thousand years of anxiety and pain, would\r\ncheaply buy an admission to your delights.\" The violence of my\r\nemotion broke my slumbers; and I awoke, like Mirza, to behold, not\r\nindeed the camels of the long valley of Bagdat, but the awakening\r\nlife and activity of the country,--the sober herd marching forth to\r\ntheir frugal pasture, the rattling swain, and the busy sounds of\r\nlabour from the opposite hamlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMEN,\r\n\r\nAND THE HONOUR PAID TO AGRICULTURE IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nFrom Navarette, Le Comte, Du Halde, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Husbandmen in China, as to rank, are preferred to Merchants\r\nand Mechanics. They are endowed with large privileges, their\r\nprofession being considered as the most necessary one in a state.\r\nNavarette observes, that the Chinese say, that the Emperor ought\r\nto take them under his particular care, and to allow them as\r\nlarge privileges as may be; because all the empire subsists by\r\ntheir labour and industry. Nay, it could not subsist without the\r\nstrongest inclination and application of the country-people that\r\nway! China being so vastly populous, that if every inch of arable\r\nland was sowed, as in fact it generally is, yet the produce would\r\nbe scarce sufficient to support the multitudes of inhabitants; and\r\nthe empire is too extensive to have its wants that way supplied from\r\nforeign parts, even if it kept up a correspondence with them. For\r\nthese reasons it has always been one of the chiefest cares of the\r\ngovernment to promote Agriculture, by honouring husbandmen and their\r\nprofession. With this view a festival is instituted in honour of\r\nagriculture; and the Emperor himself, once a year, turns ploughman,\r\nin imitation, as it is said, of the early monarchs, whose history\r\nseems to be calculated for the same end.\r\n\r\nThe common opinion, according to the Missioners, is, that husbandry\r\nwas first taught by _Shin-nong_, who is at this day reverenced\r\nas the inventor of so useful an art; which has still gained\r\nfarther credit from what is related in the books of their ancient\r\nphilosophers. The Emperor _Yau_, who began to reign four hundred and\r\neighty years after the monarch, it seems, set aside his own children\r\nin favour of a young husbandman, whom he chose for his successor.\r\nThis choice of an emperor out of the country, has inspired the\r\nChinese with a great esteem for agriculture. _Yu_, who succeeded\r\n_Shun_, came to the throne after the same manner. It is said, he\r\nfound out the way, by means of canals, to drain off the water into\r\nthe sea, which at the beginning of the empire overflowed several\r\nlow countries, and afterwards made use of them to render the soil\r\nfruitful. It is added that he wrote several books concerning the\r\nmanner of cultivating land, and watering it, which induced _Shun_\r\nto appoint him his successor, and has contributed much to raise the\r\ncredit of agriculture, as they see it has been thought worthy the\r\ncare and application of a great Prince.\r\n\r\nSeveral other emperors have expressed their zeal for this art. _Kang\r\nVang_, third monarch of the _Chew_ family, caused land-marks to be\r\nfixed, to prevent disputes among the husbandmen. _King-Ving_, the\r\ntwenty-fourth of the same race, in whose reign _Confusius_ was born,\r\nfive hundred and thirty-one years before Christ, renewed the laws\r\nthat had been made for promoting agriculture. In a word, the Emperor\r\n_Ven-ti_, who reigned three hundred and fifty-two years after,\r\nraised its esteem to a great pitch: for this Prince perceiving,\r\nthat his country was ruined by the wars, to engage his subjects to\r\ncultivate the land, set them an example himself, by ploughing the\r\nfields belonging to his palace: which obliged all the ministers and\r\ngentlemen of his court to do the same.\r\n\r\nIt is thought, that this was the original of a great festival that\r\nis solemnized every year in all the great cities of China, when\r\nthe sun enters the fifteenth degree of aquarius; which the Chinese\r\nlook upon as the beginning of the spring. On this day the Governor\r\ncomes out of his palace, carried in his chair, preceded by banners,\r\nlighted torches, and divers instruments; he is attended with several\r\nlitters, painted, and adorned with a variety of silk tapestry;\r\nexhibiting various figures, and the portraits of illustrious\r\npersons who had practised husbandry, with histories relating to\r\nthe same subject! He is crowned with flowers; and marches in this\r\nequipage towards the eastern gate of the city, as it were to meet\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nAmong the figures, there is a cow of earthenware, so monstrously\r\nlarge that forty men can hardly carry it.--Behind the cow, whose\r\nhorns are gilt, is a young child with one foot naked and the other\r\nshod: him they call the _genius of labour and diligence_; who\r\nstrikes the earthen cow incessantly with a rod, as though it were to\r\nmake it advance. All the husbandmen follow with their instruments;\r\nafter whom proceed companies of Masquers and Comedians, acting\r\nplays. In this manner they march to the Governor's palace, where\r\nthey strip the cow of her ornaments; and drawing out of her belly a\r\nprodigious number of small cows made of clay, and distribute them\r\namong the multitude, as well as the fragments of the cow, which they\r\nbreak into pieces.--Afterwards the Governor makes a short discourse,\r\nrecommending the care of husbandry as one of the things most\r\nconducive to the good of a state.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Emperors and Mandarins to the cultivation\r\nof the land is so great, that when deputies arrive at court from\r\nthe Vice-Roys, the Chinese monarch never forgets to demand in\r\nwhat condition the fields appeared to them; and the falling of\r\na seasonable shower furnishes a proper occasion for visiting a\r\nMandarin, to compliment him thereupon.--Every year, in spring,\r\nwhich falls in February, the Emperor (according to the ancient\r\ncustom) goes himself, in a solemn manner, to plough a few ridges\r\nof land, in order to animate the husbandmen by his own example;\r\nand the Mandarins of every city perform the ceremony, which is as\r\nfollows--The tribunal of Mathematics having, pursuant to orders,\r\nfixed on the twenty-fourth of the second moon, as the proper day\r\nfor the ceremony of tillage, that of the Rites gave notice to the\r\npresent Emperor _Yong-Ching_, by a memorial which set forth the\r\nfollowing particulars to be observed by him, preparatory to this\r\nfestival.--1st. That he should appoint 12 illustrious persons to\r\nattend and plough after him, viz. three princes, and nine presidents\r\nof the sovereign courts; or the assistants of the latter, in case\r\nthey were too old, or infirm.--2nd. That as this ceremony does not\r\nsolely consist in the Emperor's ploughing the earth, in order to\r\nstir up emulation by his own example; but also includes a sacrifice,\r\nwhich he, as Chief Pontiff, offers to _Shang-ti_, to procure plenty\r\nfrom him in favour of the people; therefore by way of preparation,\r\nhe ought to fast and observe continence the three preceding days;\r\nthe Princes and Mandarins, who accompany his Majesty, ought to\r\nprepare themselves in the same manner.--3rd. That on the eve of the\r\nceremony, his Majesty is to send several Lords of the first quality\r\nto the Hall of his ancestors, to prostrate themselves before their\r\nTablet, and give them notice, as though they were yet living, that\r\nthe next day he will offer the great sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBesides these directions to the Emperor, the tribunal likewise\r\nprescribes the preparations to be made by the different tribunals;\r\none is obliged to prepare the sacrifice; another to compose the\r\nformula; another to carry and set up the tents, under which his\r\nMajesty is to dine, in case he so orders it; a fourth is to assemble\r\nforty or fifty husbandmen, venerable for their age, who are to be\r\npresent when the Emperor ploughs the ground, with forty of the\r\nyounger sort to make ready the ploughs, yoke the oxen, and prepare\r\nthe grain that is to be sown; consisting of five sorts, supposed to\r\ncomprehend all the rest, as wheat, rice, beans, and two kinds of\r\nmillet.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the moon, the Emperor went with his\r\nwhole court, in his habit of ceremony, to the place appointed, to\r\noffer to _Shang-ti_ the spring sacrifice; by which he is implored to\r\nincrease and preserve the fruits of the earth. The place is a little\r\nhillock made of earth, a few furlongs south from the city; on the\r\nside of this elevation, which ought to be fifty feet four inches\r\nhigh, is the spot which is to be ploughed by the Imperial hands.\r\n\r\nAfter the Emperor had offered sacrifices, he descended with the\r\nthree Princes and nine Presidents, who were to plough with him.\r\nSeveral great Lords carried the valuable chests, which contained\r\nthe grains that were to be sown. All the court attended with\r\nprofound silence; then the Emperor took the plough and tilled the\r\nground several times backwards and forwards; when he quitted it a\r\nprince of the blood held it and ploughed; as did all the rest in\r\ntheir turns. After having ploughed in several places, the Emperor\r\nsowed the different grain; and the day following, the Husbandmen by\r\nprofession, (forty-four of them old and forty-two of them young)\r\nfinished the remainder of the field that was left untilled. The\r\nceremony concluded with the appointed reward, which the Emperor\r\nbestowed upon each of them; consisting of four pieces of dyed cotton\r\nto make cloths.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of _Pe-King_ goes often to visit this field, which is\r\ncultivated with great care; and examines all the ridges thoroughly,\r\nto see if he can meet with any uncommon ears, such as they reckon\r\ngood omens; on which occasion he gives notice, that he found a\r\nstalk, for instance, that bore thirteen ears. In the autumn the same\r\ngovernor gets in the grain in yellow sacks; which are stowed in a\r\ngranary built for that purpose, called the _Imperial Magazine_. This\r\ngrain is kept for the most solemn ceremonies; for when the Emperor\r\nsacrifices to _Tyen_, or _Shang-ti_, he offers it as the fruit of\r\nhis own hands; and on certain days in the year, he presents it to\r\nhis ancestors, as if they were still living.\r\n\r\nAmong several good regulations made by the same Emperor, he has\r\nshown an uncommon regard for the Husbandmen. To encourage them in\r\ntheir labour, he has ordered the governors of all the cities to send\r\nhim notice every year, of the person of this profession, in their\r\nrespective districts, who is most remarkable for his application to\r\nagriculture; for unblemished reputation; for preserving union in\r\nhis own family, and peace with his neighbours; for his frugality\r\nand aversion to extravagance. Upon the report of the governor,\r\nthe Emperor will advance this wise and diligent Husbandman to the\r\ndegree of a Mandarin of the eighth order, and send him patents of an\r\nordinary Mandarin; which distinction will entitle him to wear the\r\nhabit of a Mandarin, to visit the governor of the city, to sit in\r\nhis presence, and drink tea with him. He will be respected all the\r\nrest of his days.--After his death he will have funeral obsequies\r\nsuitable to his degree; and his title of honour shall be written in\r\nthe hall of his ancestors. What emulation must such a reward excite\r\namong the Husbandmen!\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find that they are continually busied about their\r\nlands if they have any time to spare, they go immediately to the\r\nmountains to cut wood; to the garden to look to their herbs, or\r\nto cut canes, &c. so that they are never idle. The land in China\r\nnever lies fallow. Generally the same ground produces three crops\r\nin a year; first rice; and before it is reaped they sow fitches;\r\nand when they are in, wheat, beans, or some other grain: thus it\r\ngoes continually round. They very seldom employ their land for\r\nunprofitable uses, such as flower gardens, or fine walks; believing\r\nuseful things more for the public good, and their own.\r\n\r\nThe attention of husbandmen is chiefly employed in the cultivation\r\nof rice. They manure their land extremely well; gathering for that\r\npurpose, with extraordinary care, all sorts of ordure, both of men\r\nand animals, or truck for it wood, herbs, or linseed oil. This kind\r\nof manure, which elsewhere would burn up the plants, is very proper\r\nfor the lands of China; where they have an art of tempering it with\r\nwater before they use it. They gather the dung in pails, which they\r\ncommonly carry covered on their shoulders; and this contributes very\r\nmuch to the cleanness of their cities, whose filth is thus taken\r\naway every day.\r\n\r\nIn the province of _Che-Kyang_, and other places, where they sow\r\nrice, they use balls of hog's, or even human hair; which, according\r\nto them, gives strength to the land, and makes that grain grow\r\nbetter. For this reason, Barbers save the hair which they cut off\r\nthe heads, and sell for about a halfpenny a pound to such people,\r\nwho carry it away in bags; and you may often see barks loaded with\r\nit. When the plant begins to ear, if the land be watered with spring\r\nwater, they mix quicklime with it; saying that it kills worms and\r\ninsects, destroys weeds, and gives a warmth to the ground, which\r\ncontributes much to fertility. By this means the rice fields are so\r\nclean, that Navarette, sometimes, walked through them, looking for\r\nsome small herb; and could never find any; so that he concludes, the\r\nrice which is surprisingly tall and fine, draws all the nourishment\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nThe husbandmen sow their grain at first without any order; but when\r\nit has shot about a foot, or a foot and a half high, they pluck it\r\nup by the roots; and making it into a sort of small sheaves, plant\r\nit by a line, and checkerwise; to the end, that ears, resting upon\r\neach other, may stand more firmly, and resist the winds.--But,\r\nbefore the rice is transplanted, they level the land, and make it\r\nvery smooth, after the following manner. Having ploughed the ground\r\nthree or four times successively, always to the ancles in water,\r\nthey break the clods with the head of their mattocks; then, by the\r\nhelp of a wooden machine (on which a man stands upright, and guides\r\nthe buffalo that draws it) they smooth the earth, that the water may\r\nbe every where of an equal height; insomuch that the plains seem\r\nmore like vast gardens than open fields.\r\n\r\nThe mountains in China are all cultivated; but one sees neither\r\nhedges nor ditches, nor scarce any tree; so fearful they are of\r\nloosing an inch of ground. It is very agreeable to behold, in some\r\nplaces, plains three or four leagues in length, surrounded with\r\nhills and mountains, cut from bottom to top, into terraces three\r\nor four feet high, and rising one above another, sometimes to the\r\nnumber of twenty or thirty. These mountains are not generally rocky,\r\nas those in Europe, the soil being light and porous, and so easy to\r\nbe cut in several provinces, that one may dig three or four hundred\r\nfeet without meeting with the rock. When the mountains are rocky,\r\nthe Chinese loosen the stones, and make little walls of them to\r\nsupport the terraces; they then level the good soil and sow it with\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThey are still more industrious.--Though in some provinces, there be\r\nbarren and uncultivated mountains, yet the valleys and fields which\r\nseparate them in a vast number of places, are very fruitful and well\r\ncultivated. The husbandman first levels all the unequal places that\r\nare capable of culture. He then divides that part of the land, which\r\nis on the same level, into plots; and that along the edges of the\r\nvalleys, which is unequal, into stories, in form of an amphitheatre:\r\nand as the rice will not thrive without water, they make reservoirs,\r\nat proper distances, and different heights, to catch the rain and\r\nthe water which descends from the mountains, in order to distribute\r\nit equally among their rice plots; either by letting it run down\r\nfrom the reservoir to the plots below, or causing it to ascend from\r\nthe lower reservoir to the highest stories.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose they make use of certain hydraulic engines, which\r\nare very simple, both as to their make and the manner of playing\r\nthem. It is composed of a chain made of wood, resembling a chaplet\r\nor pair of beads, strung as it were with a great number of flat\r\nboards, six or seven inches square, and placed parallel at equal\r\ndistances. This chain passes through a square tube or gutter: at\r\nthe lower end whereof is a smooth cylinder or barrel, whose axis is\r\nfixed in the two sides: and to the upper end is fastened a sort of\r\ndrum, set round with little boards to answer those of the chain,\r\nwhich passes round both it and the cylinder; so that when the drum\r\nis turned, the chain turns also; and, consequently, the lower end of\r\nthe gutter or tube being put into the water, and the drum-end set\r\nto the height where the water is to be conveyed, the boards filling\r\nexactly the cavity of the tube, must carry up a continual stream\r\nso long as the machine is in motion; which is performed in three\r\nways:--1st. With the hand, by means of one or two handles applied\r\nto the ends of the axis of the drum.--2nd. With the feet, by means\r\nof certain large wooden pegs, about half a foot long, set round the\r\naxle-tree of the drum for that purpose.--These pegs have long heads,\r\nrounded on the outside, for applying the soles of the naked feet; so\r\nthat one or more men, may with the greatest ease put the engine in\r\nmotion, either standing or sitting; their hands being employed all\r\nthe while, the one holding an umbrella, and the other a fan.--3rd.\r\nBy the assistance of a buffalo, or some other animal made fast to\r\na great wheel, about four yards in diameter, placed horizontally.\r\nRound its circumference are fixed a great number of pegs or teeth;\r\nwhich tallying exactly with those in the axle-tree of the drum, turn\r\nthe machine with a great deal of ease.\r\n\r\nWhen a canal is to be cleansed, which often happens,--it is divided,\r\nat convenient distances, by dikes; and every neighbouring village,\r\nbeing allotted its share, the peasants immediately appear with\r\ntheir chain-engines; whereby the water is conveyed from one to the\r\nother. This labour, though painful, is soon ended, by means of the\r\nmultitudes of hands. In some parts, as the province of _Fo-Kyen_,\r\nthe mountains, though not very high, are contiguous, and with\r\nscarce any valleys between; yet they are all cultivated by the art\r\nwhich the husbandmen have to convey the water from one to the other\r\nthrough pipes made of bamboo.\r\n\r\nTo this surprizing industry of the husbandmen, is owing that\r\ngreat plenty of grain and herbs, that reigns in China above all\r\nother regions. Notwithstanding which, the land hardly suffices to\r\nsupport its inhabitants; and one may venture to say, that to live\r\ncomfortably they have need of a country as large again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON SALT AS A MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of agriculture has been, and no doubt will continue to\r\nbe, proportionate to the advancement of the science of chymistry;\r\nand the absolute necessity of calling in the aid of this science\r\nto that of agriculture, will be perfectly evident, when we\r\nreflect, that whenever any substance is applied to the soil, it\r\nbecomes very frequently changed into new matter by combination or\r\ndecomposition.--When a handful of salt is thrown upon some soils,\r\nits nature is in a very short time changed, and it becomes a new\r\nsubstance, which may be useful or injurious to vegetation, according\r\nto the change which it has undergone. Hence originates the great\r\ndiversity of opinion, relative to the use of salt as a manure, a\r\nsubject which the science of chymistry would set at rest, after a\r\nfew simple experiments, but which the practice of agriculture would\r\nnever determine without the knowledge of the effect of the soil,\r\non the salt. There are also other considerations which materially\r\naffect the value in which this article is held as a manure. The\r\nfarmers in Cornwall, in England, use the salt in which fish has\r\nbeen cured, by which the salt has already been partially changed,\r\nby combining it with the ammonia of the fish, which is one of the\r\nmost powerful fertilizers known to chymical science. The practice\r\nalso of using sea sand, in the same shire, is attended with effects\r\nwhich are as much owing to the use of the sand as the salt.--The\r\nastonishing effect produced by the urine of cattle, in Flanders,\r\nis no evidence in favour of salt, [as the urine contains twelve or\r\nthirteen fertilizing saline substances, besides salt] but it is a\r\nvery powerful one in favour of compound saline manures. Salt is used\r\nin one of the preparations for the Patent Plaster, or Fertilizing\r\nCompost, but it is in that case combined with quicklime, and its\r\neventual product is the muriate of lime and soda, both of which,\r\nwhen combined with other substances, are powerful fertilizers.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a provision of nature, that the muriate of soda,\r\nor common salt, should be a neutral substance with respect to\r\nfertilizing the soil. For if it possessed any degree of fertilizing\r\npowers, its effect would be seen on our sea-coasts; and its utility,\r\nby this time, would have been decisively proved by experiment as\r\nwell as accident. That salt is partially beneficial to some soils,\r\nis beyond a doubt; but whether the benefit is equivalent to the\r\nexpense of using it, is a question which can only be determined by\r\nthe nature of the soil.--Wherever lime is used as a manure, salt\r\nmay be beneficially applied, or when combined with any fertilizing\r\nsubstance which has a tendency to decompose it, but in this case\r\nthe fertilizing power is owing to the new product, and not to the\r\nmuriate of soda.\r\n\r\n[_Morn. Chron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUST TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer in the Long Island Star, highly recommends the cultivation\r\nof the Locust Tree, as a profitable business. He says the price of\r\nthis timber is about seventy-five cents per cubic foot--that 200\r\ntrees will grow on an acre of land--or 20,000 trees to a hundred\r\nacres, which may average 20 feet per tree, which would give the\r\nenormous sum of $300,000. But suppose they amount to only $100,000,\r\nas the nett profits from 100 acres, in what way can the landholder\r\nexpect so great a profit in 30 years, with the same probability of\r\nsuccess, as from this? He mentions, that the timber, the seeds of\r\nwhich were planted by one man in England, was sold for 60,000_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThe locust becomes valuable in 15 years after planting, and in 25\r\nor 30 years of full growth. It is easily raised by planting 15 or\r\n20 trees to the acre; and as soon as the roots have spread, running\r\na plough through the ground, and when it cuts the roots, new shoots\r\nwill spring up.\r\n\r\nThis tree also invites the grass to grow under it, and the shade\r\ndoes not materially injure it; and while grass in the field is burnt\r\nup by the scorching rays of the sun, the locust grove will yield a\r\nrich and luxuriant pasture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Baldwin's London Magazine.\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF RICHARD L. EDGEWORTH, Esq.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Memoirs of the late R. L. Edgeworth, Esq. begun by himself, and\r\n  finished by his Daughter, Maria Edgeworth. 2 vols. London, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume contains such part of the memoirs of Mr Edgeworth\r\nas was written by himself, and is of a very different complexion\r\nfrom the second from the pen of his daughter. We see in every page\r\nof the former, evidence of that abundance of animal spirits, and\r\nhealthy activity of body and mind, which often changed their channel\r\nof direction in the course of his life, without ever relaxing their\r\ninnate spring, or losing any of their pristine force of impulse.\r\nIt is indeed Mr. Edgeworth's boast, corroborated by his daughter's\r\ntestimony, that he was unchanged by age, or events.--He seems to\r\nhave had a ready and quick feeling for every thing that happened,\r\njust as the bulrush has a rapid sympathy with the breeze that passes\r\nover it, and raises its head exactly into its old position the\r\ninstant it is gone by. Mr. Edgeworth began to marry at twenty, and\r\ncontinued the practice till late in life. In fact, matrimony and\r\nmechanics seem to have monopolized his fidelity: with dancing he\r\nwas desperately enamoured at first, but his taste soon tired of it,\r\nthough he is careful to assure us his legs never did. Gambling and\r\ndissipated companions possessed him for a time, but neither sullied\r\nhis mind, nor permanently influenced his habits. Telegraphs and\r\none-wheeled chaises, however, kept stronger hold of him: he was the\r\nfirst to send poetry across the channel by a chain of signals; and\r\nhe contrived for himself a carriage in which his \"_legs were warned\r\nto lift themselves up_,\" to escape being broken by posts, and in\r\nwhich he sat \"_pretty safe_ from wet,\" his feet being \"secured by\r\nleathers which folded up like the sides of bellows.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his exploits in this commodious vehicle, he records in a tone\r\nof exultation with which we entirely sympathize:--\r\n\r\n\"On my road to Birmingham, I passed through Long-Compton, in\r\nWarwickshire, on a Sunday. The people were returning from church,\r\nand numbers stopped to gaze at me. There is or was a shallow ford\r\nnear the town, over which there was a very narrow bridge for\r\nhorse and foot passengers, but not sufficiently wide for wagons or\r\nchaises. Towards this bridge I drove. The people, not perceiving\r\nthe structure of my one-wheeled vehicle, called to me with great\r\neagerness to warn me, that the bridge was too narrow for carriages.\r\nI had an excellent horse, which went so fast as to give but little\r\ntime for examination. The louder they called, the faster I drove,\r\nand when I had passed the bridge, they shouted after me with\r\nsurprise. I got on to Shipton upon Stour; but, before I had dined\r\nthere, I found that my fame had overtaken me. My carriage was put\r\ninto a coach-house, so that those who came from Long-Compton, not\r\nseeing it, did not recognize me; I therefore had an opportunity of\r\nhearing all the exaggerations and strange conjectures, which were\r\nmade by those who related my passage over the narrow bridge. There\r\nwere posts on the bridge, to prevent, as I suppose, more than one\r\nhorseman from passing at once. Some of the spectators asserted, that\r\nmy carriage had gone over these posts; others said that it had not\r\n_wheels_, which was indeed literally true; but they meant to say\r\nthat it was without any wheel. Some were sure that no carriage ever\r\nwent so fast; and all agreed, that at the end of the bridge, where\r\nthe floods had laid the road for some way under water, my carriage\r\nswam on the surface of the water.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edgeworth was also, about the commencement of his career in\r\nmechanics, lucky enough to contrive a wheel which \"should carry on a\r\nman _as fast as he could possibly walk_,\" that is to say, provided\r\nhe \"_plied his legs with energy_.\" On the first experiment being\r\nmade, it answered its purpose so well as to give the lad within\r\nscarcely time \"_to jump from his rolling prison before it reached\r\nthe chalk-pit_; but the wheel went on with such velocity as to\r\noutstrip its pursuers, and rolling over the edge of the precipice\r\nit was dashed to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nTo recompense himself for this misfortune, he invented \"_a sailing\r\ncarriage_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The carriage was light, steady, and ran with amazing velocity.\r\nOne day when I was preparing for a sail in it, with my friend and\r\nschoolfellow, Mr. William Foster, my wheel-boat escaped from its\r\nmoorings, just as we were going to step on board. With the utmost\r\ndifficulty I overtook it, and as I saw three or four stage coaches\r\non the road, and feared that this sailing chariot might frighten\r\ntheir horses, I, at the hazard of my life, got into my carriage\r\nwhile it was under full sail, and then, at a favourable part of\r\nthe road, I used the means I had of guiding it easily out of the\r\nway. But the sense of the mischief which must have ensued, if I had\r\nnot succeeded in getting into the machine at the proper place, and\r\nstopping it at the right moment was so strong, as to deter me from\r\ntrying any more experiments on this carriage in such a dangerous\r\nplace. Such should never be attempted except on a large common,\r\n_at a distance from a high road_. It may not however be amiss to\r\nsuggest, that upon a large extent of iron rail-way, in an open\r\ncountry, carriages properly constructed, might make profitable\r\nvoyages from time to time with sails instead of horses; for though\r\na constant or regular intercourse could not be thus carried on, yet\r\ngoods of a certain sort, that are saleable at any time, might be\r\nstored till wind and weather were favourable.\"\r\n\r\nOne more of Mr. Edgeworth's ingenious inventions is all we can allow\r\nto this subject:--he offered for a wager to produce a _wooden horse\r\nthat should carry him safely over the highest wall in the country_!\r\n\r\n\"It struck me, that, if a machine were made with eight legs, four\r\nonly of which should stand upon the ground at one time; if the\r\nremaining four were raised up into the body of the machine, and if\r\nthis body were divided into two parts, sliding, or rather rolling on\r\ncylinders, one of the parts, and the legs belonging to it, might in\r\ntwo efforts be projected over the wall by a person in the machine;\r\nand the legs belonging to this part might be let down to the\r\nground, and then the other half of the machine might have its legs\r\ndrawn up, and be projected over the wall, and so on alternately.\r\nThis idea by degrees developed itself in my mind, so as to make me\r\nperceive, that as one half of the machine was always a road for the\r\nother half, and that such a machine never rolled upon the ground,\r\na carriage might be made, which should carry a road for itself. It\r\nis already certain, that a carriage moving on an iron rail-way may\r\nbe drawn with a fourth part of the force requisite to draw it on a\r\ncommon road. After having made a number of models of my machine,\r\nthat should carry and lay down its own road. _I took out a patent\r\nto secure to myself the principle_; but the term of my patent has\r\nbeen long since expired, without my having been able to unite to my\r\nsatisfaction in this machine strength with sufficient lightness,\r\nand with regular motion, so as to obtain the advantages I proposed.\r\nAs an _encouragement to perseverance_, I assure my readers, that I\r\nnever lost sight of this scheme during _forty years_; that I have\r\nmade considerably above _one hundred_ working models upon this\r\nprinciple, in a great variety of forms; and that, _although I have\r\nnot yet been able to accomplish my project, I am still satisfied\r\nthat it is feasible_.\"\r\n\r\nJustice, however, will not permit us to go to other matters\r\ncontained in these most entertaining biographical notices, without\r\ncautioning the reader not to take the standard of the utility and\r\nintelligence of Mr. Edgeworth's mechanical pursuits, from these\r\nspecimens of his achievements in this line. He effected much of a\r\nmore useful nature, and appears to have had very considerable talent\r\nin his way--but so in fact had _King Corny_.\r\n\r\nMr. Edgeworth's first marriage was the only unsuitable one of\r\nthe several it was his fortune to make; and not finding his wife\r\ncheerful at home, he says, led him to seek cheerful company abroad.\r\nIn fact, before the death of his father, we find him quite involved\r\nin the vortex of dissipation and fashion. His picture of the\r\n_beau monde_ of those times is not without its charm. \"Among the\r\nladies who visited the Mrs. Blakes, was a Miss Dalton, the famous\r\n\"Fanny, blooming fair,\" whom Lord Chesterfield has celebrated.\r\nHe was ingenious enough to detect the legerdemain tricks of the\r\n\"celebrated Comus.\" Miss D. told him that her relation, the famous\r\nSir Francis Blake Delaval, had also discovered these secrets, and\r\nbelieved himself to be the only man in England who possessed them.\r\nThis brought about an acquaintance, or rather intimacy, between Mr.\r\nEdgeworth and Sir Francis, from the description of the incidents of\r\nwhich we derive much amusement. They arranged together the house in\r\nDowning street, where Sir Francis lived, for the representation of\r\nconjuring tricks.\r\n\r\n\"The ingenuity of some of the contrivances, that were employed in\r\nour deceptions, attracted the notice not only of those who sought\r\nmere amusement, but of men of letters and science, who came to our\r\nexhibitions. This circumstance was highly grateful to Sir Francis,\r\nand advantageous to me. I, by these means, became acquainted with\r\nmany men of eminence, to whom I could not at any period of my life\r\nhave otherwise obtained familiar access. Among the number were\r\nDr. Knight, of the British Museum: Dr. Watson; Mr. Wilson; Mr.\r\nEspinasse, the electrician; Foote, the author and actor, a man, who,\r\nbeside his well known humour, possessed a considerable fund of\r\nreal feeling; Macklin, and all the famous actors of the day. They\r\nresorted to a constant table, which was open to men of genius and\r\nmerit in every department of literature and science.--I cannot say\r\nthat his guests were always \"unelbowed by a player;\" but I can truly\r\nassert, that none but those who were an honour to the stage, and who\r\nwere admitted into the best company at other houses, were received\r\nat Sir Francis Delaval's.\r\n\r\nThey got up the tragedy of the Fair Penitent here, to allow the\r\nlate Duke of York, who afterwards died suddenly at Rome, to play\r\nLothario; and \"he was as warm, as hasty, and as much in love, as the\r\nfair Calista could possibly wish.\" A pleasant supper-party, he says,\r\nthey had at the King's Arms, Covent Garden, after the performance.\r\n\r\n\"Macklin called for a nightcap, and threw off his wig. This, it was\r\nwhispered to me, was a signal of his intention to be entertaining.\r\nPlays, play-wrights, enunciation, action, every thing belonging to\r\neloquence of every species, was discussed. Angelo, the graceful\r\nfencing-master, and Bensley, the actor, were of the party.--Angelo\r\nwas consulted by Bensley, on what he ought to do with his hands\r\nwhile he was speaking. Angelo told him, that it was impossible to\r\nprescribe what he should always do with them; but that it was easy\r\nto tell him what should _not_ be done--\"he should not put them into\r\nhis breeches' pockets\"--a custom to which poor Bensley was much\r\naddicted. Pronunciation was discussed; the faults in our language\r\nin this particular were copiously enumerated. \"For instance,\" said\r\nMacklin, \"_Pare_ me a _pair_ of _pears_.\" You may take three words\r\nout of this sentence, of the same sound, but of different meanings,\r\nand I defy any man to pronounce them in such a manner as to\r\ndiscriminate the sounds, or to mark to any ear by his pronunciation\r\nthe difference between the verb _to pare_, the noun of number, _a\r\npair_, and the fruit, _pear_. The pompous Bensley undertook that\r\nPowel, who was remarkable for a good ear, should do this. Bensley,\r\nwho mouthed prodigiously whilst he spoke, was put behind a curtain,\r\nthat the motion of his lips might not assist Powel in judging what\r\nmeaning he intended to express by each of the words as he pronounced\r\nthem. One of the company was placed behind the curtain, and to\r\nhim Bensley was previously to communicate, whether he proposed to\r\npronounce the word denoting the action, the noun of number, or the\r\nfruit. Bensley failed so often, and so ridiculously, that he became\r\nquite angry, and charged Powel with wilful misapprehension. To\r\ndefend himself, Powel proposed that Holland should try his skill;\r\nbut Holland had no better success. During these trials, I concerted\r\nby signs with Sir Francis, a method of pointing out my meaning, and\r\nI offered to try my skill. The audience with difficulty restrained\r\ntheir contempt: but I took my place behind the curtain, and they\r\nwere soon compelled to acknowledge, that I had a more distinct\r\npronunciation, or that Sir Francis had more acute hearing, than\r\nthe rest of the company. Out of twenty experiments, I never failed\r\nmore than two or three times, and in these I failed on purpose,\r\nto prevent suspicion. I had made my confederate understand, that\r\nwhen I turned my right foot outward, as it appeared from beneath\r\nthe curtain, I meant to say _pare_, to cut; when I turned inward,\r\n_pair_, a couple; and when it was straight forward, _pear_, the\r\nfruit. We kept our own counsel, and won unmerited applause. Amidst\r\nsuch trifling as this, much sound criticism was mixed, which\r\nimproved my literary taste, and a number of entertaining anecdotes\r\nwere related, which informed my inexperienced mind with knowledge of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the many excellent anecdotes which Mr. Edgeworth\r\nintroduces relative to the extraordinary man of the town with\r\nwhom he was now passing his time, we shall give as a sample.\r\nSir Francis had contrived to represent the borough of Andover,\r\nin several Parliaments, by practising a series of tricks on his\r\nconstituents:--but at length, he sustained a reverse of fortune, and\r\nhis electioneering success terminated.\r\n\r\nHis attorney's bill was yet to be discharged. It had been running\r\non for many years; and though large sums had been paid on account,\r\na prodigious balance still remained to be adjusted. The affair came\r\nbefore the King's Bench. Among a variety of exorbitant and monstrous\r\ncharges, there appeared the following article.\r\n\r\n\"To being thrown out of the window at the George Inn, Andover--to my\r\nleg being thereby broken--to surgeon's bill, and loss of time and\r\nbusiness--all in the service of Sir F. B. Delaval.--Five hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"When this curious _item_ came to be explained, it appeared, that\r\nthe attorney had, by way of promoting Sir Francis' interest in the\r\nborough, sent cards of invitation to the officers of a regiment in\r\nthe town, in the name of the mayor and corporation, inviting them\r\nto dine and drink his Majesty's health on his birthday. He, at the\r\nsame time, wrote a similar invitation to the mayor and corporation,\r\nin the name of the officers of the regiment. The two companies met,\r\ncomplimented each other, eat a good dinner, drank a hearty bottle\r\nof wine to his Majesty's health, and prepared to break up.--The\r\ncommanding officer of the regiment, being the politest man in\r\ncompany, made a handsome speech to Mr. Mayor, thanking him for his\r\nhospitable invitation and entertainment. \"No, Colonel,\" replied the\r\nmayor, \"it is to you that thanks are due by me and by my brother\r\naldermen for your generous treat to us.\" The colonel replied with\r\nas much warmth as good breeding would allow: the mayor retorted\r\nwith downright anger, swearing that he would not be choused by the\r\nbravest colonel in his Majesty's service.--\"Mr. Mayor,\" said the\r\ncolonel, \"there is no necessity for displaying any vulgar passion on\r\nthis occasion. Permit me to show you, that I have here your obliging\r\ncard of invitation.\"--\"Nay, Mr. Colonel, here is no opportunity for\r\nbantering, there is your card.\"\r\n\r\nUpon examining the cards, it was observed, that notwithstanding an\r\nattempt to disguise it, both cards were written in the same hand by\r\nsome person, who had designed to make fools of them all. Every eye\r\nof the corporation turned spontaneously upon the attorney, who, of\r\ncourse, attended all public meetings. His impudence suddenly gave\r\nway, he faltered and betrayed himself so fully by his confusion,\r\nthat the colonel, in a fit of summary justice, threw him out of\r\nthe window. For this Sir Francis Delaval was charged five hundred\r\npounds.--Whether he paid the money of not, I forget.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROMPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_It will do for the present._\r\n\r\nThis common saying does as much mischief in society, as _rum_ or a\r\n_pestilence_. If I hear a man, whether a farmer, a mechanic, or any\r\nother person, often repeat that saying, and appear to act from the\r\nopinion, that _it will do for the present_, I rely on it he is a\r\nsloven, a drone, or something worse. I never knew such a man thrive.\r\n\r\nA young man setting out in life, is in haste to be married. He\r\nwants a house to live in, but is not fully able to build one. Yet\r\nhis pride requires a large showy house. At last, between poverty\r\nand pride, he determines to build a large house, but not to finish\r\nit till he is _more able_. He sets up a large two story house,\r\nwith four rooms in a story--he covers it and paints it: this is\r\na showy house--his pride exults to see passengers stare at his\r\nelegant house: but though _pride_ governs the _outside_, _poverty_\r\nreigns _within_--he can finish but two rooms, half finish one or\r\ntwo more--and lay a loose floor above, to spread his corn upon:\r\nthis elegant mansion house then is a granary--a corn house: the\r\nman and a litter of children below--and rats and mice above: but\r\nthe man says, _it will do for the present_. True, but the man has\r\nbut twenty or thirty acres of land, or an indifferent trade--his\r\nfamily grows faster than his income--he is not able to finish his\r\nhouse--the covering soon decays and admits water--the house falls to\r\npieces--the man is forced _poor_ into the wilderness, or he and his\r\nchildren loiter about, dependant on the neighbours for subsistence\r\nby day labour.\r\n\r\nI know one of these _do-for-the-present-farmers_, who never\r\neffectually repairs his fences; but when a breach is made, he fills\r\nit with a bush that a sheep may remove: if a rail is broke, and\r\nanother is not at hand, he takes the next billet of wood, inserts\r\none end into the post, and ties up the other with elm or hickory\r\nbark--he says, _this will do for the present_. His cattle learn to\r\nbe unruly--to remedy the evil, fetters, shackles, clogs, yokes, and\r\nwhat he calls _pokes_, are invented--and his cattle and horses are\r\ndoomed to hobble about their pasture with a hundred weight of wood\r\nor iron machines upon their feet and necks. The man himself, in\r\ntwo years, spends time enough in patching up his fences and making\r\nfetters, to make a good effectual fence round his whole farm, which\r\nwould want very little repair in twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn family affairs, these _do-for-the-present folks_ double their\r\nnecessary labour. They labour hard to put things _out of order_,\r\nand then it requires nearly the same work to put them into order\r\nagain. A man uses an axe, a hoe, a spade, and throws it down where\r\nhe uses it; instead of putting it in its proper place, under cover.\r\nExposed to the weather, tools do not last more than half so long,\r\nas when kept housed; but this is not all: a sloven leaves the tool\r\nwhere he last used it--or throws it down any where at random: in a\r\nfew days he wants it again--he has forgot where he left it--he goes\r\nto look for it--he spends perhaps half an hour in search of it, or\r\nwalks a distance to get it: this time is lost, for it breaks in upon\r\nsome other business--the loss of this small portion of time appears\r\ntrifling; but slovens and sluts incur such losses every day; and\r\nthe loss of these little scraps of time determine a man's fortune.\r\nLet the Prompter make a little calculation: a farmer, whose family\r\nexpends one hundred pounds a year, if he can clear ten pounds a year\r\nis a thriving man. In order to get his one hundred and ten pounds,\r\nsuppose he labours ten hours a day: in this case, if he loses an\r\n_hour_ every day, in repairing the carelessness of the day before\r\n(and every sloven and slut loses more time than this, every day,\r\nfor want of care and order) he loses a _tenth_ part of his time--a\r\n_tenth_ part of his income--this is _eleven pounds_. Such a man\r\ncannot thrive--he must grow poorer, for want of _care_, of _order_,\r\nof _method_.\r\n\r\nSo it is with a woman. A neat woman who does business thoroughly,\r\nkeeps things _in order_, with about _half the labour_ that a slut\r\nemploys who keeps things for ever _out of order_. If a pail or\r\nkettle be used, it is directly made clean, fit for other uses, and\r\nput in its place. When it is wanted, it is ready. But a slut uses\r\nan article and leaves it _any where_, dirty, unfit for use another\r\ntime: by and by it is wanted, and cannot be found--\"Moll, where\r\ndid you leave the kettle?\" \"I han't had the kettle, Nab had it\r\nlast\"--\"Nab, did you have the kettle?\" \"Yes, but it is dirty.\" So\r\nthe kettle is found, but it is a half hour's work to fit it for the\r\npurpose required; in the mean time, the necessary business must lie\r\nby. Yet this woman says, when she does any thing, _it will do for\r\nthe present_.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that I went to church, on a late cold Sunday,\r\nwhen a neighbouring clergyman officiated. He had spoken to his\r\n_fifteenthly_, when the clock struck _one_. Every man was shivering\r\nwith the cold, and shuffling his feet--the parson took the hint, and\r\nbroke off with \"_this will do for the present_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAPLES OF MISSOURI.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Lead._--MISSOURI is famed throughout Europe and America, for the\r\nextent and value of her lead mines. She would be able to furnish\r\nall the U. States, the West Indies, Mexico, and South America, with\r\nthat article. In the meantime, the U. States are purchasing lead\r\nfrom England! About $500,000 per annum is usually paid by Americans\r\nto Englishmen for lead; last year, however, it was about $300,000.\r\nThe difference of the policy pursued by the two nations, is the\r\ncause of this state of things. In England, foreign lead pays a duty\r\nof 26_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ sterling on every quantity of 100_l._ worth\r\nimported; and the lead mines are private property. In America,\r\nforeign lead pays but little duty, and the mines are monopolized by\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n2. _Iron._--Missouri has a great interest in the production of\r\ndomestic iron. She possesses immense beds of ore, exceedingly\r\nrich, and well situated to be worked, and conveniently transported\r\nto all parts of the valley of the Mississippi. The waters of the\r\nMerrimac, and of the Gasconade are the chief seats of this ore,\r\nalthough it is found in many other parts of the territory, and in\r\nsuch amazing quantities, that it may be considered to be for ever\r\ninexhaustible. Missouri could furnish not only herself and immediate\r\nneighbours, but the whole valley of the Mississippi with iron and\r\nits manufactures, yet she is purchasing these articles from England,\r\nSweden and Russia!\r\n\r\n3. _Salt._---The state of Missouri abounds with salt springs. In\r\nmany places they are almost as common as fresh water springs. They\r\nare found in every section of the country, but especially in the\r\nBoon's-lick district, and on the waters of Salt River, a branch\r\nof the Mississippi. Missouri would be able to furnish an empire\r\nwith salt, but heretofore she has purchased that article from\r\nthe Illinois and Kenawha, from Liverpool, St. Ubes, and Turk's\r\nIsland!--The government monopoly was one cause of this. Since the\r\npurchase of Louisiana the government had reserved the salt springs;\r\nbut in the bill for admitting Missouri into the Union, 12 springs,\r\nto be chosen by the Legislature, with four sections of land around\r\neach, are to be given to the state; and the remainder will probably\r\nbe sold out, and become private property. These springs will be a\r\nsource of wealth to the people, and of revenue to the state. With\r\na judicious system of management, the whole expenses of the state\r\ngovernment may possibly be defrayed from the rents and profits\r\naccruing from 12 selected springs.\r\n\r\n4. _Hemp._--The soil and the climate of Missouri, announce it to be\r\nthe true country for the production of hemp. Experience establishes\r\nthe fact. Many farmers have raised it, as well under the Spanish\r\nas under the American government. The quantity obtained from an\r\nacre is prodigious, and by experiments made at New Orleans, under\r\nthe auspices of the Governor General, the Baron de Carondelet, it\r\nwas proved to be equal (the account says superior) in strength and\r\nfineness of fibre, to the boasted hemp of Russia. Persons who have\r\nlooked to the resources of Missouri have always considered hemp as\r\none of its staples, and the encouragement of its growth one of the\r\nfirst objects of our farmers and statesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH NATURAL TO MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn your paper some time past I saw an account of \"a wild woman found\r\nin the interior of Java.\" History furnishes many instances of these\r\n\"unfortunate commoners of nature,\" who have been exposed by design\r\nor accident. Comparatively few, we fear, have been brought to the\r\ndomestic hearth; fewer still have been completely civilized. A book\r\nof travels, now almost obsolete, states instances of this kind. A\r\nrace of marauding Tartars, subjects of Russia, frequently attacked\r\nPolish villages, and carried off whole families: in conveying their\r\ncaptives home they had to pass the wild and intricate forest of\r\nMinsk, in Russian Lithuania, and there these unfortunate mothers\r\nlost, and were separated from, their children. In after days, when\r\nthis stupendous region was traversed for other purposes than the\r\nnefarious one above mentioned, several human males were found, in\r\nalmost as barbarous a state as the native burghers of the forest,\r\nto whose ferocious instinct many of these innocents had doubtless\r\nfallen a prey.\r\n\r\nPeter, the Wild Boy, excited much interest in his day. George the\r\n2d, of England, found him whilst hunting in the woods near Hamelin,\r\nin the electorate of Hanover. Peter, when found, ran on all fours,\r\nlike the quadrupeds amongst whom he had been raised. We might ask,\r\nwhy did the brutes of prey in this as well as other instances,\r\ndeviate from the voracious instinct planted in their nature? To\r\naccident we cannot refer it; and, after wearying our minds with\r\nconjecture, we can only end the difficulty by attributing it to that\r\nprovidential care which preserved Daniel in the lion's den. Peter\r\nnever could be taught to articulate more than two words--his own\r\nname and George; but he learned, with facility and correctness, the\r\nnotes of several tunes.\r\n\r\nLord Monboddo, of eccentric memory, mentions in his narrative\r\nrespecting Peter, that two children had been found in the same wild\r\nstate--one in the island of Diego Garcia, and one in the Pyrenees.\r\nHe also states that two wild children were found in the Dismal Swamp\r\nof Virginia.[2] This immense morass is yet, in its inmost recesses,\r\nthe refuge of wild animals of prey, particularly bears, panthers,\r\nand wild cats. During a fire in these swamps, 10 or 12 years ago,\r\nnumbers were hunted down, who had fled before the rapid flames.\r\nA resident in that neighbourhood informed me that he had seen 17\r\nof these animals, some half-burned, hung upon a single tree. In\r\nrespect to the children noticed by Lord Monboddo, I cannot, in any\r\nhistory of either Virginia or North Carolina, find the least hint\r\nof such a circumstance having occurred; nor does the writer specify\r\nthe period when they were found. Is it not probable that these\r\noutcasts from society (admitting the noble author to be rightly\r\ninformed) were the offspring of aboriginal females, compelled to\r\nseek shelter in these swamps from the invading colonist, or from\r\nsome hostile tribe?--Amongst the innumerable tribes of Indians in\r\nVirginia and North Carolina, the _Tuskaroras_ were perhaps most\r\npowerful, and most immediately in the vicinity of this large tract.\r\nThese aborigines were not all dispersed or destroyed until 1803,\r\nsome of them living peaceably on the reserved lands. The main body\r\nof this tribe of Indians had migrated to New York state, and joined\r\nthe Senecas, (one of the Six Nations,) many years preceding. Is it\r\nnot probable, I again ask, that the young savages of lord Monboddo\r\ndid, in fact, inherit the name from their birth? I would ask, as a\r\nmatter of curiosity, of yourselves, Messrs. Editors, or any of your\r\ncorrespondents, answers to the following questions: When were these\r\nchildren found? Of what age when discovered? By whom found? What\r\nbecame of them? Could they be taught the use of speech?\r\n\r\n  [2] This great swamp, containing nearly 150,000 acres, lies more in\r\n  North Carolina than Virginia. It is a marshy region, covered with\r\n  a thick growth of cypress or juniper, many of which trees are of a\r\n  prodigious growth. These trees are occasionally intermingled with\r\n  oak, poplar, and maple. The annual fall of leaves, and the decay\r\n  of trees, raise the surface above the original soil some feet,\r\n  this part being completely saturated with water. The improvements\r\n  in agriculture have done much to drain this vast surface, and many\r\n  parts are sufficiently dry for the shingle-cutters and stave-makers\r\n  to pursue their avocations in spots of this dreary region.\r\n\r\nLord Monboddo maintains that speech is not natural to man, and\r\nthat the want of it is no proof that the Ourang-Outang is not of\r\nthe same species, as that animal only wants the _artificial_ use\r\nof it. King John, of England,[3] held the same hypothesis upwards\r\nof five centuries before. Tradition (for such records are beneath\r\nthe dignity of history) asserts, that this monarch imprisoned two\r\nchildren (a male and female) in separate cells.[4] When, at a\r\ncertain age, they were brought before him, each of these little\r\nvictims repeated a sarcasm on his folly in thus confining them. He\r\nconsidered his hypothesis as confirmed, but punished the keepers.\r\nThe legend is here torn, and we do not learn (supposing it true)\r\nwhat became of the children, or what further progress they made in\r\nlanguage. That man has the power, as well as the organs of speech,\r\nit appears an absurdity to deny; for, what country has ever been\r\ndiscovered where the natives had not the means of communicating\r\nverbally with each other? In the earliest records of the world\r\nwe find no sanction for such an opinion; for the Antediluvians\r\nwere certainly not defective in the power or use of speech to\r\nconvey their ideas. If we deny this we virtually acknowledge our\r\nbelief that the Mosaic account of the creation is \"a cunningly\r\ndevised fable.\" After the Flood we cannot doubt that Noah and his\r\ndescendants still spoke the language of Adam. \"All the nations\r\nspoke one language.\" Lord Kames contends that, after the building\r\nof Babel, \"men again degenerated into a savage state,\" which he\r\nattributes to the confusion of tongues, and the dispersion of the\r\ntribes. We are no where told that they lost or forgot the use of\r\nspeech, which lord Monboddo considers incidental to the savage state.\r\n\r\n  [3] The Prince John of Ivanhoe, whom Hume characterises as replete\r\n  \"with cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity, licentiousness,\r\n  ingratitude, treachery, tyranny, and cruelty.\" What a tissue of\r\n  crimes! And this was a King!\r\n\r\n  [4] In Newark Castle, where John died in 1216.\r\n\r\nLord Kames appears to take it for granted that _all_ the men then\r\nin existence were engaged in this stupendous and impious attempt\r\nto scale Heaven, and \"make themselves a name.\"--This idea is not\r\nconveyed by the sacred historian; it therefore appears probable\r\nthat the tribes which continued together still spoke the _original\r\nlanguage_, and remained in one place, and as one people. I fear\r\nI have trespassed on your limits, but the subject arose from the\r\npreceding remarks. I conclude with reiterating my request respecting\r\nthe children found in the Dismal Swamp.\r\n\r\n[_Nat. Int._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL STONE FLOORS _and coverings for houses as made in some\r\nparts of Russia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe floors and coverings of houses in some parts of South Russia\r\nare made in the following manner:--For a floor let the ground be\r\nmade even, and some stones of any shape be put on, and with a heavy\r\nwooden rammer force or break the stones into the ground, continuing\r\nto beat the floor until it becomes quite even, and incapable of\r\nreceiving any further impression. Then run lime, immediately after\r\nit has been slacked, through a fine sieve as expeditiously as\r\npossible, because exposure to the air weakens the lime. Mix two\r\nparts of coarse sand or washed gravel, for there must be no earth in\r\nit, with one part of lime powder, and wet them with bullock's blood;\r\nso little moist however, as merely to prevent the lime blowing away\r\nin powder--in short, the less moist the better: spread it on the\r\nfloor, and without a moment's loss of time, let several men be ready\r\nwith large beetles to beat the mixture, which will become more and\r\nmore moist by the excessive beating requisite. Then put on it some\r\nof the dry sand and lime mixed, and beat it till like a stone. If\r\nrequired to be very fine, take for the next layer finely sifted\r\nlime, with about a tenth part of rye flour, and a little ox blood;\r\nbeat it with a trowel. The next day again smooth it with a trowel,\r\nand so continue to do daily till it be entirely dry. When it is\r\nquite dry and hard, rub it over with fresh ox blood, taking off all\r\nwhich it will not imbibe. No wet will penetrate this composition,\r\nwhich, however, after some time is often painted with oil colours.\r\nThe whole floor appears as a single stone, and nothing will affect\r\nit.--The drier it is used the better, provided that with much\r\nbeating it becomes like a very stiff mortar, and evidently forms a\r\ncompact body.\r\n\r\nOn flat tops of houses, the beetles or rammers' ends must be\r\nsmaller, to prevent the rebounding of the boards and timber, which\r\nwould crack the cement; but, when the thickness of a foot is laid\r\non, it will beat more firmly. A thick coating of ox blood, flour\r\nand lime, being beat in large, strong wooden troughs, or mortar,\r\ntill it can be spread with a trowel, may be used without beating\r\nit again on the floor or house-top: but it must be very stiff, and\r\nused most expeditiously. Even frost will not affect it. With this\r\ncomposition, artificial stone may be made, rammed very hard into\r\nstrong wooden frames of the required shape, particularly to turn\r\narches for buildings of rammed earth. It is well known that earth\r\nwhich is not too argillaceous, with only the moisture it has when\r\nfresh dug, on being rammed between frames of wood till the rammer\r\nwill no longer impress it, makes eternal walls; but a mass as hard\r\nas stone may be made with a little lime added to sand, horse-dung,\r\nor ox blood. The more the lime is beaten, the moister it becomes,\r\nand it must contain so much moisture as to become by beating a solid\r\nmass, adhering in all its parts, and not remain crumbling, that will\r\nproperly set as a mortar. If there be too little moisture at first,\r\nit will remain a powder; if there be too much it will become a soft\r\nmortar. Lime is of no use mixed with clay or vegetable earths,\r\nwhich, if well beaten, are stronger without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A LATE ENGLISH PAPER.\r\n\r\nATTACK BY BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome days ago the following singular narrative appeared in the\r\nBerlin Gazette: it was furnished to that paper by M. Eulert, a\r\nmerchant of that city, who was himself the party principally\r\nconcerned:--\r\n\r\n\"I was travelling,\" says M. Eulert, \"on the 20th of July, at 7\r\no'clock in the morning, in my carriage, accompanied by my wife, on\r\nmy way from Wirtemberg to Berlin, between Kroppstadt and the town\r\nof Schmogelsdorf, which is contiguous to the high road; I observed\r\none of my horses rub himself with uneasiness against the other.\r\nI remarked to my wife that the animal no doubt was stung by a\r\nhorse-fly. Whilst we were talking upon the subject, we were suddenly\r\nsurrounded by a swarm of bees, so thick, that our carriage horses,\r\ncoachman, my wife, and myself, were completely covered. The furious\r\ninsects attached themselves immediately to the nose, mouth, eyes and\r\nears of each horse; the two animals seemed to be deprived of every\r\nsense, and as if overcome with stupor, they lay down, and stretched\r\nthemselves out an unresisting prey to the bees.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we perceived this cloud of insects to lessen around us,\r\nmy wife threw over her hat the hood of her night cloak, got out of\r\nthe carriage, went back a little way on the road, and instinctively\r\nfled into the ditch, where she lay down with her face to the earth.\r\nI exerted myself in the meantime in endeavouring to get over this\r\ndisaster; I went also out of the carriage, and covering my face and\r\nneck with my handkerchief, I re-ascended the carriage, and with all\r\nmy strength cried out for help.--Three peasants, a short distance\r\noff, had all the while calmly observed my situation; but neither\r\nby the offer of reward, nor by the most urgent entreaty, could I\r\nprevail upon them to render us any assistance; they turned their\r\nbacks upon us, and pursued their way to the village. In this unhappy\r\nplight I walked on for half an hour, when I met the road-keeper,\r\nnamed Daniel Arndt, and a carrier, named David Henry, accompanied\r\nby some labourers, and driving a cart with three horses.--Still\r\ntormented by the bees, and pursued by them with inconceivable\r\nbitterness, I breathed at last, and was relieved by this rencontre,\r\nas these good people had lighted tobacco pipes, and the smoke\r\ndispersed my disagreeable guests.\r\n\r\n\"The carrier being informed of the danger, in order not to expose\r\nhimself to it, would not stir one pace further; and as the bees\r\nbegan to surround us on all sides, he unharnessed his team, left\r\nhis cart laden with goods on the road, and took a by-way in order\r\nto place his horses under shelter in the village. Soon after the\r\nother people accompanied me to where my horses were, and they\r\nbrought with them an abundance of hay and straw. There we found my\r\nunfortunate coachman stretched in the ditch, his head and hands\r\nall covered with bees, so that the road-keeper was obliged to use\r\na brush to get them off his face; his hair was matted with blood,\r\nand as the insects could not be extricated, they were crushed to\r\ndeath.--Whilst this operation was going on, we set fire to the\r\nstraw, and succeeded in driving away the bees.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the carrier had placed his horses in safety, he came\r\nback to us having fortified himself in every way against the bees,\r\nand showed himself anxious to give all the assistance in his power\r\nto my horses.--But one of them was so severely injured, that he died\r\nthe same day. The other was conducted to Schmogelsdorf; but though\r\nthe veterinary surgeon exhausted all his skill, the animal perished\r\nin twenty-four hours after.\r\n\r\n\"My coachman had brought his misfortune on himself, because, in\r\nendeavouring to succour the horses, he had lost his hat. The bees\r\nfastened on his naked head, and deprived him of his senses, and\r\nfor forty-eight hours he remained in a state of suffering that\r\nthreatened to terminate in his death. We were supplied with horses,\r\nand had him conveyed to Treuenbrietzen, where he recovered. He had\r\nat first cried out so vehemently for assistance, that the bees got\r\ninto his mouth and throat. I myself passed twenty-four hours in\r\nextreme pain at the same place, and was compelled to apply several\r\npoultices, to my head, neck, and ears, to appease the inflammation.\r\n\r\n\"My wife, who, as if by inspiration, threw herself down into the\r\nditch, came out again perfectly safe--and in a few days after, the\r\ncoachman and I were at length entirely recovered.\r\n\r\n\"I attribute this accident to two causes. In the first place, I now\r\nbelieve it was not a horse fly that stung the horse, as I at first\r\nsupposed, but rather the queen bee, which must have been killed when\r\nthe animal rubbed against his companion. I conjecture this to have\r\nbeen the case, from the natural history of these insects; it is very\r\ncommon to see a swarm of bees, when deprived of their leading queen,\r\nunite with other swarms, and fall with a species of madness, upon\r\nthe first objects they encounter.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, I attribute the circumstance to the fact, that,\r\ncontrary to express prohibition of the magistrates, the Commune of\r\nSchmogelsdorf, besides its proper number of 900 hives, takes in\r\nan equal number from the neighbouring communes to tend during the\r\ntime of swarming, because the flowers, fields and gardens which it\r\ncontains, present a singularly rich pasture for such insects. Hence\r\nit happens, that in a small space nearly two thousand hives are\r\ncrowded together, so that in the season of swarming it is dangerous\r\nto pass that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY Of THE SPITZBERGEN WHALE.\r\n\r\nExtracted from Scoresby's valuable work, \"Arctic Voyages,\" &c. just\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\nErroneous opinions have been entertained respecting the Whale (the\r\nBalæna Mysticetus) having been of a much larger size in former\r\ntimes than now: from a comparison of the preceding accounts of all\r\ncredible witnesses, the author says--\r\n\r\n\"Hence I conceive we may satisfactorily conclude, that whales\r\nof as large size are found now, as at any former period since\r\nthe Spitzbergen fishery was discovered; and I may also remark,\r\nthat where any respectable authority affords actual measurements\r\nexceeding 70 feet, it will always be found that the specimen\r\nreferred to, was not one of the Mysticetus kind, but of the B.\r\nPhysalis, or the B. Musculus, animals which considerably exceed\r\nin length any of the common whales that I have either heard of,\r\nor met with. When fully grown, therefore, the length of the whale\r\nmay be stated as varying from 50 to 65, and rarely, if ever,\r\nreaching 70 feet; and its greatest circumference from 30 to 40\r\nfeet. It is thickest a little behind the fins, or in the middle,\r\nbetween the anterior and posterior extremes of the animal; from\r\nwhence it gradually tapers in a conical form, towards the tail, and\r\nslightly towards the head. Its form is cylindrical from the neck,\r\nto within ten feet of the tail, beyond which it becomes somewhat\r\nquadrangular, the greatest ridge being upward, or on the back, and\r\nrunning backward nearly across the middle of the tail. The head has\r\nsomewhat of a triangular shape. The under-part, the arched outline\r\nof which is given by the jaw-bones, is flat, and measures 16 to 20\r\nfeet in length, and 10 to 12 in breadth. The lips, extending 15 to\r\n20 feet in length, and 5 or 6 in height, and forming the cavity\r\nof the mouth, are attached to the under-jaw, and rise from the\r\njaw-bones, at an angle of about 80 degrees, having the appearance,\r\nwhen viewed in front, of the letter U. The upper jaw, including the\r\n'crown-bone,' or skull, is bent down at the extremity, so as to\r\nshut the front and upper parts of the cavity of the mouth, and is\r\noverlapped by the lips in a squamous manner at the sides. When the\r\nmouth is open, it presents a cavity as large as a room, and capable\r\nof containing a merchant-ship's jolly-boat, full of men, being 6 or\r\n8 feet wide, 10 or 12 feet high (in front), and 15 or 16 feet long.\r\nThe fins, two in number, are placed between one-third and two-fifths\r\nof the length of the animal, from the snout, and about two feet\r\nbehind the angle of the mouth. They are 7 to 9 feet in length, and\r\n4 or 5 in breadth. The part by which they are attached to the body,\r\nis somewhat elliptical, and about 2 feet in diameter; the side which\r\nstrikes the water is nearly flat. The articulation being perfectly\r\nspherical, the fins are capable of motion in any direction; but,\r\nfrom the tension of the flesh and skin below, they cannot be raised\r\nabove the horizontal position. Hence the account given by some\r\nnaturalists, that the whale supports its young by its fins, on its\r\nback, must be erroneous. The fins, after death, are always hard and\r\nstiff; but, in the living animal, it is presumed, from the nature\r\nof the internal structure, that they are capable of considerable\r\nflexion. The whale has no dorsal fin. The tail, comprising, in a\r\nsingle surface, 80 or 100 square feet, is a formidable instrument of\r\nmotion and defence. Its length is only 5 or 6 feet; but its width is\r\n18 to 24 or 26 feet. Its position is horizontal. In its form it is\r\nflat and semi-lunar; indented in the middle; the two lobes somewhat\r\npointed, and turned a little backward. Its motions are rapid and\r\nuniversal; its strength immense. The eyes are situated in the sides\r\nof the head, about a foot obliquely above and behind the angle of\r\nthe mouth. They are remarkably small in proportion to the bulk of\r\nthe animal's body, being little larger than those of an ox. The\r\nwhale has no external ear; not can any orifice for the admission of\r\nsound be discovered until the skin is removed.\r\n\r\nOn the most elevated part of the head, about 16 feet from the\r\nanterior extremity of the jaw, are situated the blow-holes, or\r\nspiracles; consisting of two longitudinal apertures 6 or eight\r\ninches in length. These are the proper nostrils of the whale. A\r\nmoist vapour, mixed with mucus, is discharged from them, when the\r\nanimal breathes; but no water accompanies it, unless an expiration\r\nof the breath be made under the surface.\r\n\r\nThe mouth, in place of teeth, contains two extensive rows of \"fins,\"\r\nor whalebone, which are suspended from the sides of the crown-bone.\r\nThese series of fins are generally curved longitudinally, although\r\nthey are sometimes straight, and give an arched form to the roof of\r\nthe mouth.--They are covered immediately by the lips attached to the\r\nlower jaw, and enclose the tongue between their lower extremities.\r\nEach series or \"side of bone,\" as the whalefishers term it, consists\r\nof upwards of 300 laminæ; the longest are near the middle, from\r\nwhence they gradually diminish away to nothing at each extremity.\r\nFifteen feet is the greatest length of the whalebone; but 10 or\r\n11 feet is the average size, and 13 feet is a magnitude seldom\r\nmet with. The greatest breadth, which is at the gum, is 10 or 12\r\ninches. The laminæ, composing the two series of bone, are ranged\r\nside by side, two thirds of an inch apart, (thickness of the blade\r\nincluded,) and resemble a frame of saws, in a saw-mill. The interior\r\nedges are covered with a fringe of hair, and the exterior edge of\r\nevery blade, excepting a few at each extremity of the series, is\r\ncurved and flattened down, so as to present a smooth surface to\r\nthe lips. In some whales, a curious hollow on one side, and ridge\r\non the other, occurs in many of the central blades of whalebone,\r\nat regular intervals of 6 or 7 inches.--May not this irregularity,\r\nlike the rings in the horns of the ox, which they resemble, afford\r\nan intimation of the age of the whale? If so, twice the number of\r\nrunning feet in the longest laminæ of whalebone in the head of a\r\nwhale not full grown, would represent its age in years. In the\r\nyoungest whales, called _suckers_, the whalebone is only a few\r\ninches long; when the length reaches 6 feet or upwards, the whale is\r\nsaid to be _size_. The colour of the whalebone is brownish-black,\r\nor bluish-black. In some animals, it is striped longitudinally\r\nwith white. When newly cleaned, the surface exhibits a fine play\r\nof colour. A large whale sometimes affords a ton and a half of\r\nwhalebone. If the \"sample blade,\" that is, the largest lamina in\r\nthe series, weigh 7 pounds, the whole produce may be estimated\r\nat a ton; and so on in proportion. The whalebone is inserted into\r\nthe crown-bone, in a sort of rabbet. All the blades in the same\r\nseries are connected together by the gum, in which the thick ends\r\nare inserted. This substance, (the gum,) is white, fibrous, tender,\r\nand tasteless. It cuts like cheese. It has the appearance of the\r\ninterior or kernel of the cocoa-nut.\r\n\r\nThe tongue occupies a large proportion of the cavity of the mouth,\r\nand the arch formed by the whalebone. It is incapable of protrusion,\r\nbeing fixed from root to tip, to the fat extending between the\r\njaw-bones.--A slight beard, consisting of a short scattered white\r\nhair, surmounts the anterior extremity of both jaws. The throat is\r\nremarkably strait.\r\n\r\nTwo paps in the female, afford the means of rearing its young. The\r\nmilk of the whale resembles that of quadrupeds in its appearance. It\r\nis said to be rich and well-flavoured.\r\n\r\nImmediately beneath the skin lies the _blubber_ or fat, encompassing\r\nthe whole body of the animal, together with the fins and tail. Its\r\ncolour is yellowish-white, yellow, or red. In the very young animal\r\nit is always yellowish-white. In some old animals, it resembles\r\nin colour the substance of the salmon. It swims in water. Its\r\nthickness all round the body, is 8 or 10 to 20 inches, varying in\r\ndifferent parts as well as in different individuals. The lips are\r\ncomposed almost entirely of blubber, and yield from one to two\r\ntons of pure oil each. The tongue is chiefly composed of a soft\r\nkind of fat, that affords less oil than any other blubber; in the\r\ncentre of the tongue, and towards the root, this fat is intermixed\r\nwith fibres of a muscular substance. The under jaw, excepting the\r\ntwo jaw-bones, consists almost wholly of fat; and the crown-bone\r\npossesses a considerable coating of it. The fins are principally\r\nblubber, tendons, and bones; and the tail possesses a thin stratum\r\nof blubber. The oil appears to be retained in the blubber in minute\r\ncells, connected together by a strong reticulated combination of\r\ntendinous fibres. The blubber, in its fresh state, is without any\r\nunpleasant smell; and it is not until after the termination of the\r\nvoyage, when the cargo is unstowed, that a Greenland ship becomes\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nFour tons of blubber by measure, generally afford three tons of oil;\r\nbut the blubber of a sucker contains a very small proportion. Whales\r\nhave been caught that afforded nearly thirty tons of pure oil;\r\nand whales yielding twenty tons of oil, are by no means uncommon.\r\nThe quantity of oil yielded by a whale, generally bears a certain\r\nproportion to the length of its longest blade of whalebone.\r\n\r\nA stout whale of sixty feet in length, is of the enormous weight of\r\nseventy tons; the blubber weighs about thirty tons, the bones of\r\nthe head, whalebone, fins and tail, eight or ten; carcase thirty or\r\nthirty-two.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the young whale is of a red colour; and when cleared of\r\nfat, broiled, and seasoned with pepper and salt, does not eat unlike\r\ncoarse beef; that of the old whale approaches to black, and is\r\nexceedingly coarse.--An immense bed of muscles surrounding the body,\r\nis appropriated chiefly to the movements of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe number of ribs, according to Sir Charles Giesecké, is thirteen\r\non each side. The bones of the fins are analogous, both in\r\nproportion and number, to those of the fingers of the human hand.\r\nFrom this peculiarity of structure, the fins have been denominated\r\nby Dr. Flemming, \"swimming paws.\" The posterior extremity of the\r\nwhale, however, is a real tail; the termination of the spine or\r\ncoccygis, running through the middle of it almost to the edge.\r\n\r\nThe whale seems dull of hearing. A noise in the air, such as that\r\nproduced by a person shouting, is not noticed by it, though at the\r\ndistance only of a ship's length; but a very slight splashing in\r\nthe water, in calm weather, excites its attention, and alarms it.\r\nIts sense of seeing is acute. Whales are observed to discover one\r\nanother, in clear water, when under the surface, at an amazing\r\ndistance. When at the surface, however, they do not see far. They\r\nhave no voice; but in breathing or _blowing_, they make a very loud\r\nnoise. The vapour they discharge, is ejected to the height of some\r\nyards, and appears at a distance, like a puff of smoke. When the\r\nanimals are wounded, it is often stained with blood; and, on the\r\napproach of death, jets of blood are sometimes discharged alone.\r\nThey blow strongest, densest, and loudest, when, \"running,\" when in\r\na state of alarm, or when they first appear at the surface, after\r\nbeing a long time down. They respire or blow about four or five\r\ntimes a-minute.\r\n\r\nThe usual rate at which whales swim, even when they are on their\r\npassage from one situation to another, seldom exceeds four miles an\r\nhour; and though when urged by the sight of any enemy, or alarmed\r\nby the stroke of a harpoon, their extreme velocity may be at the\r\nrate of eight or nine miles an hour: yet we find this speed never\r\ncontinues longer than for a few minutes, before it relaxes almost to\r\none-half. Hence, for the space of a few minutes, they are capable\r\nof darting through the water, with the velocity almost of the\r\nfastest ship under sail, and of ascending with such rapidity as to\r\nleap entirely out of the water. This feat they sometimes perform\r\nas an amusement apparently, to the high admiration of the distant\r\nspectator; but to the no small terror of the unexperienced fishers\r\nwho, even under such circumstances, are often ordered, by the\r\nfoolhardy harpooner, to \"pull away\" to the attack. Sometimes the\r\nwhales throw themselves into a perpendicular posture, with their\r\nheads downward, and, rearing their tails on high in the air, beat\r\nthe water with awful violence.--In both these cases, the sea is\r\nthrown into foam, and the air filled with vapours; the noise, in\r\ncalm weather, is heard to a great distance; and the concentric waves\r\nproduced by the concussions on the water, are communicated abroad\r\nto a considerable extent. Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous\r\ntail in the air, which, cracking like a whip, resounds to the\r\ndistance of two or three miles.\r\n\r\nWhen it retires from the surface, it first lifts its head, then\r\nplunging it under water, elevates its back like the segment of a\r\nsphere, deliberately rounds it away towards the extremity, throws\r\nits tail out of the water, and then disappears.\r\n\r\nIn their usual conduct, whales remain at the surface to breathe,\r\nabout two minutes, seldom longer; during which time, they \"blow\"\r\neight or nine times, and then descend for an interval usually of\r\nfive or ten minutes; but sometimes, when feeding, fifteen or twenty.\r\nThe depth to which they commonly descend, is not known, though from\r\nthe \"eddy\" occasionally observed on the water, it is evidently, at\r\ntimes, only trifling. But, when struck, the quantity of line they\r\nsometimes take out of the boats, in a perpendicular descent, affords\r\na good measure of the depth. By this rule, they have been known to\r\ndescend to the depth of an English mile; and with such velocity,\r\nthat instances have occurred, in which whales have been drawn up by\r\nthe line attached, from a depth of 700 or 800 fathoms, and have been\r\nfound to have broken their jaw-bones, and sometimes crown-bone, by\r\nthe blow struck against the bottom. Some persons are of opinion,\r\nthat whales can remain under a field of ice, or at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, in shallow water, when undisturbed, for many hours at a\r\ntime.--Whales are seldom found sleeping: yet, in calm weather, among\r\nice, instances occasionally occur.\r\n\r\nThe food of the whale consists of various species of actiniæ,\r\ncliones, sepiæ, medusæ, cancri, and helices; or at least some of\r\nthese genera are always to be seen whenever any tribe of whales\r\nis found stationary and feeding. In the dead animals, however, in\r\nthe very few instances in which I have been enabled to open their\r\nstomachs, squillæ or shrimps were the only substances discovered.\r\nIn the mouth of a whale just killed, I once found a quantity of the\r\nsame kind of insect.\r\n\r\nWhen the whale feeds, it swims with considerable velocity below the\r\nsurface of the sea, with its jaws widely extended. A stream of water\r\nconsequently enters its capacious mouth, and along with it, large\r\nquantities of water insects; the water escapes again at the sides;\r\nbut the food is entangled and sifted as it were, by the whalebone,\r\nwhich, from its compact arrangement, and the thick internal covering\r\nof hair, does not allow a particle the size of the smallest grain to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH BANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, June 19, 1820, at 8 o'clock, died, at his house,\r\nSpring Grove, near Hounslow, the venerable President of the Royal\r\nSociety, the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, G. C. B. &c. &c. &c. The\r\nloss to science by the demise of this excellent man and liberal\r\npatron will be long and severely felt. It will be recollected, that\r\nwhen it was determined to send Captain Cook on his first voyage\r\nround the globe, Sir Joseph Banks, then a young man, whose ardent\r\nmind glowed with a love of science and of ingenious enterprise,\r\ndetermined to accompany him. His liberal spirit and generous\r\ncuriosity were regarded with admiration, and every convenience from\r\nthe government was readily supplied to render the circumstances of\r\nthe voyage as comfortable as possible. Far, however, from soliciting\r\nany accommodation that might occasion expense to government, Mr.\r\nBanks was ready to contribute largely out of his own private fortune\r\ntowards the general purposes of the expedition. He engaged as his\r\ndirector in natural history during the voyage, and as the companion\r\nof his researches, Dr. Solander, of the British museum, a Swede\r\nby birth, and one of the most eminent pupils of Linnæus, whose\r\nscientific merits had been his chief recommendation to patronage in\r\nEngland. He also took with him two draughtsmen, one to delineate\r\nviews and figures, the other to paint subjects of natural history.\r\nA secretary and four servants formed the rest of his suite. He took\r\ncare to provide likewise the necessary instruments for his intended\r\nobservations, with convenience for preserving such specimens as he\r\nmight collect of natural or artificial objects, and with stores\r\nto be distributed in the remote isles he was going to visit, for\r\nthe improvement of the condition of savage life. In the course of\r\nthe voyage dangers were encountered of no ordinary magnitude. On\r\nthe coast of Terra del Fuego in an excursion to view the natural\r\nproductions of the country, Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander had\r\nnearly perished in a storm of snow. After passing a night on land,\r\namid the storm, they at last, and with much difficulty, made their\r\nway back to the beach, and were received on board the ship; but\r\nthree of the persons who accompanied them were lost. Shortly after\r\nhis return from this voyage, Sir Joseph, in company with his friend\r\nDr. Solander, visited Iceland. A rich harvest of new knowledge\r\nand of specimens compensated for the toils and expense of this\r\nscientific adventure. They afterwards visited the Western Islands of\r\nScotland: and among other things worthy of notice, they discovered\r\nthe columna stratification of the rocks surrounding the caves of\r\nStaffa; a phenomenon till then unobserved by naturalists, but was\r\nno sooner made known in a description by Sir J. Banks, than it\r\nbecame famous among men of science throughout Europe. In 1777, when\r\nSir John Pringle retired from the presidency of the Royal Society,\r\nSir Joseph Banks was elected to fill the vacant chair; and never\r\nperhaps has it been filled with more honour to the individual, or\r\nmore advantage to the interests of science. His time, his wealth,\r\n(which was a princely fortune,) his influence, his talents, an\r\nincomparable library of science and art; knowledge and judgment\r\nto advise; affability to conciliate and encourage; generosity to\r\nassist; all in short of which he possessed, and it was all something\r\neither of goodness or greatness, he made the patrimony of the\r\nstudious and learned, not of his own country alone, but of the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS FACTS IN NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examination of flowers by the microscope opens a new field\r\nof wonder to the inquiring naturalist; by which we are enabled\r\nto perceive that the minutest works of Nature are adorned with\r\nthe most consummate elegance and beauty. As one proof, from\r\ninnumerable others that might be selected, I beg to subjoin Sir\r\nJohn Hill's interesting account of what appeared on examining\r\na carnation;--first published in the Inspector, No. 109. \"The\r\nprincipal flower in this _bouquet_, was a _carnation_; the fragrance\r\nof this led me to enjoy it frequently and nearly: the sense of\r\nsmelling was not the only one affected on these occasions; while\r\nthat was satiated with the powerful sweet, the ear was constantly\r\nattacked by an extremely soft but agreeable murmuring sound. It\r\nwas easy to know that some animal, within the covert, must be the\r\nmusician, and that the little noise must come from some little body\r\nsuited to produce it. I instantly distended the lower part of the\r\nflower, and, placing it in a full light, could discover troops of\r\nlittle insects frisking and capering with wild jollity among the\r\nnarrow pedestals that supported its leaves, and the little threads\r\nthat occupied its centre! I was not cruel enough to pull out any one\r\nof them for examination: but adapting a microscope to take in at one\r\nview, the whole base of the flower, I gave myself an opportunity of\r\ncontemplating what they were about, and this for many days together\r\nwithout giving them the least disturbance.--Thus could I discover\r\ntheir economy, their passions and their enjoyments. The microscope,\r\non this occasion, had given what nature seemed to have denied to\r\nthe objects of contemplation. The base of the flower extended\r\nitself under its influence to a vast plain; the slender stems of\r\nthe leaves became trunks of so many stately cedars; the threads in\r\nthe middle seemed columns of massy structure, supporting at the\r\ntop their several ornaments; and the narrow spaces between were\r\nenlarged into walls, paterres, and terraces. On the polished bottom\r\nof these, brighter than Parian marble, walked in pairs, alone, or in\r\nlarger companies, the winged inhabitants: these from little dusky\r\nflies (for such only the naked eye would have shown them,) were\r\nraised to glorious glittering animals, stained with living purple,\r\nand with a glossy gold that would have made all the labours of the\r\nloom contemptible in the comparison. I could, at leisure as they\r\nwalked together, admire their elegant limbs, their velvet shoulders,\r\nand their silken wings; their backs vieing with the empyrean\r\nin its blue; and their eyes, each formed of a thousand others,\r\nout-glittering the little planes on a brilliant; above description,\r\nand too great almost for admiration. Here were the perfumed groves,\r\nthe more than myrtle shades, of the poet's fancy, realized; here\r\nthe little animals spent their days in joyful dalliance; or in the\r\ntriumph of their little hearts, skipped after one another from stem\r\nto stem among the painted trees; or winged their short flight to\r\nthe close shadow of some broader leaf, to revel undisturbed in the\r\nheights of all felicity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong a number of instances of the celebrated Dr. Moncey's absence\r\nof mind, is one which he frequently mentioned, and laughed at\r\nheartily, when in good humour, at the same time observing that\r\nhis brother was as bad as himself. The doctor being once on a\r\nvisit to his brother, in Norfolk, in the beginning of winter, and\r\nintending to set off for London the next day, his brother proposed\r\nto go and shoot wild ducks early in the morning, that he might\r\ncarry two or three couple fresh killed to London with him. The\r\nservant was ordered to clean the long fowling piece, get plenty\r\nof powder and shot, and to goose-grease their boots. Every thing\r\nbeing in readiness according to their desire, about an hour before\r\nday-light the doctor and his brother set off for the place where\r\nthe ducks resort, in order to be there by the break of day, when\r\nthey generally take wing to go to feed. They had walked nearly three\r\nmiles, and it having rained in the night, the clay mud wall was very\r\ndirty and greasy, when they heard the cry of the ducks. They were\r\nnow obliged to get over the wall and the gate, across a sluice into\r\nthe marsh where the ducks were. The rain had raised the water about\r\na foot. It was then proposed that one should go over, and the other\r\nremain behind. Says the doctor, \"George, do you go over, for I have\r\nforgotten my boots.\" \"So have I doctor,\" says his brother; \"but we\r\nwont lose our sport, as we have come so far.\" So both waded through,\r\nand got over the gate into the marsh, and advancing along the fleet,\r\nthey at length perceived the ducks. \"You are near enough, George,\"\r\nsaid the doctor.--\"Aye,\" replied George, \"I think we are not above\r\na hundred yards off.\" \"Why then fire,\" says the doctor.--\"Do you\r\nfire,\" returned George. \"Why I hav'nt got the gun; do you fire.\"\r\n\"I fire! why I have not got the gun,\" said his brother, \"I thought\r\nyou had it. What a fine opportunity is lost. Here are not less than\r\nthirty ducks within shot, and neither of us have got the gun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE-PRESERVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following simple method of rescuing drowning persons from a\r\nwatery grave, is contained in a long article on that subject, in a\r\nlate Liverpool paper, and is deserving of attention. The writer says:\r\n\r\nIf any one estimate inventions in the inverse ratio of their\r\nsimplicity, they will smile to hear that the life-preserver which\r\nI have so highly extolled, is no more than a _hat_ and _pocket\r\nhanderchief_;[5] so that every man has, at all times, about his\r\nperson an apparatus which may be the means of saving the life of his\r\nfellow creature.\r\n\r\n  [5] A large silk handkerchief is the best for the occasion.\r\n\r\nWith these simple means any man who can swim may safely venture into\r\nthe water, with the certainty of rescuing a drowning person. All the\r\npreparation, which need not occupy ten seconds, is this: Spread the\r\nhandkerchief out on the ground, and place the hat upon it in the\r\ncentre, with the crown upwards, in the ordinary position of wearing;\r\nthen gather up the four corners of the handerchief over the crown\r\nof the hat, giving it a few twists for the greater convenience of\r\ngrasping with the hand. The hat must then be inverted, (the crown\r\ndownwards.) In this position, it is confidently asserted, any person\r\nmay safely enter the water, as the cavity of the hat contains, a\r\nmuch greater quantity of air than is requisite to sustain any man. I\r\nfound that the hat with which I tried the experiment, would almost\r\nsupport me and another person clinging to me, neither of us making\r\nthe least effort to float by any motion of the hands and feet. The\r\nmode I should adopt, however, in using the life-preserver, would be\r\nto give up the handkerchief to the person whose life was in danger,\r\nand immediately to disengage myself from him. He would soon discover\r\nthat he was buoyed up, and would recover his presence of mind; but,\r\nwhether he did or not, it would be of little consequence, as long\r\nas he retained his grasp of the handkerchief. Whilst he was thus\r\nsupported, nothing could be more easy than to push him to the shore\r\nwith one hand, swimming with the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN O'GROAT'S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place so denominated is still a land-mark, although the house\r\nhas long fallen to decay; so totally so that not a vestige remains;\r\nbut the scite is an object of curiosity to travellers, for the\r\nsingularity of the building, which tradition has preserved the form\r\nof, and the motive for its erection. In the reign of James the VIth\r\nof Scotland, (James the Ist of England,) two brothers, named Malcomb\r\nGavin, and John O'Groat, arrived in Caithness from Holland, and it\r\nis said brought letters from the King. They purchased or possessed\r\nthemselves of the lands of Warse and Duningsbay, lying near the\r\nPortland Hills. They increased in course of time to eight families:\r\nhere they lived peaceably and comfortably for many years, and held\r\nan annual feast to commemorate the landing of their ancestors. Could\r\nit be supposed that any petty distinctions should have a tendency\r\nto interrupt the family harmony? but so it was. Each head of the\r\nfamilies contended for the seniority and chieftainship of the\r\nclan. The ingenuity of one (a John O'Groat) settled the dispute\r\nfor precedency, which arose upon the importance of sitting at the\r\nhead of the table, and the right of entering first in at the door!\r\nJohn occupied a ferry, and his daily intercourse with strangers had\r\nenlarged his ideas: he expostulated with his clan on the folly of\r\ntheir pretensions, and represented, that quarrels amongst themselves\r\nwould render them obnoxious to the people where they had settled.\r\nJohn's reasoning prevailed, and they agreed to be guided by him: in\r\ndue time he fulfilled his plan to reconcile their discordant ideas.\r\nHe built a very large room in an octagon form, with eight doors\r\nand eight windows in it; in this room he placed a massy oak table\r\nwith eight sides. At the next anniversary meeting, he requested\r\neach head of the families to enter at the door most convenient to\r\ntheir dwelling at the same moment; he then took the unoccupied seat.\r\nThe scite, as has been observed, is still celebrated, and will be\r\nso, whilst good intentions, and a plain useful understanding, are\r\nconsidered estimable qualities. Fully to appreciate this, we should\r\nrecollect the deadly feuds which frequently arose in Scotland in\r\nformer days, even on less grounds than precedency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTFORD FAIR.\r\n\r\nFrom the Connecticut Mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n     To the Executive Committee of the Hartford County Agricultural\r\n     Society. The Committee appointed to examine Domestic\r\n     Manufactures, and award premiums to those who in their opinion\r\n     are entitled to them, respectfully report:\r\n\r\nThat notwithstanding the unpleasant weather, the articles they\r\nwere called to inspect were greater in number, and in general much\r\nsuperior in quality to those exhibited last year.\r\n\r\nThere were some woollen cloths of a finer texture and finish, than\r\nthat which obtained the premium, but a part of them were not of\r\nthe requisite width, and others were dyed in the piece, while your\r\ncommittee felt it their duty to give the preference to cloth dyed in\r\nthe wool. A piece inferior to the premium cloth sold for $2.50 per\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nIt was with much satisfaction that our committee remarked the\r\nimprovement in the manufacture of Carpeting; last year but one piece\r\noffered for their inspection was filled with wool, while this year\r\nmost of those exhibited were of that description. They were also\r\ngratified to learn that the premium carpets were all spun and dyed\r\nin the family.\r\n\r\nThe committee are of opinion that scarcely any thing submitted to\r\ntheir examination denotes so rapid an improvement in taste and\r\ndomestic industry, as the hearth rugs--those which were this year\r\nexhibited displayed an elegance both in their design and execution,\r\nwhich in articles of that kind is rarely met with.\r\n\r\nMany of the flannels were of a quality much superior to those\r\nexhibited last year. A large part of them sold at from eighty cents\r\nto one dollar; and the premium flannel brought $1.25 by the piece.\r\n\r\nThe premium blankets excited universal attention, and were equally\r\nadmired for their beauty and for their more substantial qualities.\r\nWe have never seen any superior to them imported from England; they\r\nmeasured nearly twelve quarters, and sold for $14.25.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of hosiery was much greater than at our former\r\nexhibition--many pairs of stockings sold at from 80 cents to $1.50.\r\n\r\nPremiums were awarded to two very fine elegant finished grass\r\nbonnets, made by the Miss Woodhouses of Weathersfield, and which\r\nare rarely surpassed in beauty by the most costly Leghorns. One\r\nvery little inferior was also exhibited, made by Miss Hanmer of\r\nthe same place. They were made of the Poa Pratensis or spear grass,\r\nand those which received the premiums sold one for 27 dollars, the\r\nother 30 dollars. Another of a quality almost equal to those just\r\nmentioned was made by a young lady of Windsor, of the sweet-scented\r\nvernal grass, and one of split straw by Miss Capen of Hartford, was\r\nremarkable for its extraordinary delicacy of texture.\r\n\r\nThe linen diapers were equal to any of English fabric, and the linen\r\nshirting which obtained the premium sold for 4_s._ 6_d._ per yard.\r\nThe committee would suggest to such as may hereafter be candidates\r\nfor the premium on linen goods, the necessity of bleaching them,\r\nsince after that process, their comparative merits can be more\r\nfairly ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe butter and cheese were excellent--the former sold for 16 cents,\r\nand a large quantity of the latter for 10 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nMany articles were also exhibited for which no premiums were\r\noffered, yet which attracted the particular attention of the\r\ncommittee and the numerous spectators. Among these were some highly\r\nfinished treble-gilt buttons, from the manufactory of Mr. Moses\r\nCook. The carpeting ingeniously manufactured from bul-rushes and\r\nwoollen yarn; white silk hose, white linen hose, white and coloured\r\ncounterpanes; a vandyke remarkable for its softness and beauty, made\r\nfrom the silk that covers the seed of the milk-weed; an excellent\r\nimitation of the Scotch plaid; and some elegant paper-hangings from\r\nthe manufactory of Mr. George Putnam. While the committee could\r\nnot but regret that the state of our funds precluded the offering\r\npremiums for such meritorious articles, yet they were highly\r\ngratified to perceive that it is not the hope of gain alone which\r\nproduces such a splendid collection of domestic manufactures, but\r\nthat there exists among all classes of the community a patriotic\r\nwish to give interest to our exhibition.\r\n\r\nYour committee cannot close their report, without congratulating\r\nyou, gentlemen, and the public at large, on the brilliant prospects\r\nof our infant society.\r\n\r\nThe general superiority of the articles we this year inspected, to\r\nthose offered at our former exhibition, together with that lively\r\ninterest they excited in the candidates for premiums, and the\r\nthousands of spectators who assembled to witness the productions\r\nof their industry, clearly evince that domestic manufactures are\r\nrapidly gaining that importance in public estimation which they so\r\nrichly deserve.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n  GEO. COWLES, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatherine Shaw, daughter of John Shaw, of Bargarron, having acquired\r\na remarkable degree of dexterity in spinning fine flax, conceived\r\nthe idea of manufacturing it into thread. Her first attempts were\r\nnecessarily on a small scale; she executed every part herself,\r\nand bleached her materials on a large slate, placed in a window.\r\nSucceeding, in her first essays, she engaged her family in the\r\nprocess, and Lady Blentyre carried a parcel of the thread to Bath,\r\nwhere she advantageously disposed of it to the lace manufacturers\r\nthere. This was the first thread that crossed the Tweed.\r\nSubsequently a connection of the family went to Holland, and brought\r\nfrom thence the secret of the twisting and twining machines in use\r\nthere, then carefully kept from public observation; also the art of\r\nnumbering the threads, and packing them for distant sale. The young\r\nwomen of the neighbourhood engaged in it also, and it became an\r\nobject of profit and interest to the place. What, it will be asked,\r\nbecame of the ingenious young woman who turned her talents to so\r\ngreat private advantage, and eventually to such public utility.[6]\r\nSurely she lived honoured, and died beloved. No! she was one of the\r\nlast victims to the imputed crime of witchcraft in the south of\r\nScotland! Amongst many others, she was accused of having evil agency\r\nwith spirits, and is described, in the records of those unhappy\r\ntimes, as \"young, handsome, and well-informed.\" Can it be possible\r\nthat the superior activity of her mind, and the industrious efforts\r\nof her hands, could have involved her in the disgraceful and frantic\r\nmeasures, which terminated in herself and five others being _burned\r\nfor witches_ in 1626? This unfortunate female was urged by her\r\nfriends to put in a plea to delay her execution--she replied, with\r\nthe dignity of a Roman matron. \"No; my honour is already destroyed,\r\nand my life is not worth defending!\"\r\n\r\n  [6] A Mr. Pollock, of Paisley, (where this unfortunate suffered\r\n  death,) availed himself of the information of assistants in the\r\n  business, and established a thread manufactory at that place, which\r\n  is yet carried on to great extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scissors._--A very valuable improvement has been made on Scissors.\r\nIt is especially so to those employed for delicate operations in\r\nsurgery. The objection to the common scissors is, that, in the\r\nact of cutting, they, to a very considerable extent, compress\r\nand bruise the parts. This is owing to the edges being set very\r\nstrong, and to the particular angle at which they are set, and is\r\nsufficient to account for wounds made by scissors refusing to unite\r\nby what surgeons call the first intention. To remedy this defect,\r\nit was lately suggested to Mr. Stodart, by Dr. Wollastan, to give\r\nto scissors the same kind of cutting edge that a knife has. This\r\nhas been done, and the success has fully justified the experiment.\r\nThe operation of hair lip has been repeatedly performed with the\r\nknife-edged scissors, both on the infant and on the adult, with\r\ncomplete success. The operation is in this way performed with\r\nfacility to the operator, and in less time than with the knife, and\r\nconsequently a less degree of pain to the patient. This improvement\r\nneed not be confined to the science of surgery. A variety of\r\ndelicate fancy work is performed by scissors, all of which will\r\nbe much better done by giving them knife-edges. There is a little\r\nart in setting the edges, readily acquired by practice; this must\r\nbe done with a view to the kind of work for which the scissors are\r\nintended. This improvement may easily be applied to common scissors,\r\nby grinding down the outer sides of the blades.\r\n\r\n[_Lon. pap._\r\n\r\n_Public Spirit._--It has been my practice for several weeks past,\r\nto walk upon one of our turnpike roads, and, for about two weeks,\r\nI noticed a very large stone, lying in what is called the \"summer\r\nroad,\" which I wished to remove, but my strength was not sufficient\r\nto do it. It remained there as permanent, to the great annoyance\r\nof all who passed that way in carriages. But one day as I was\r\npassing it, I saw a stout negro fellow, whose cart was _beyond_\r\nit as to the course which he was going, tugging at it, and he\r\nfinally succeeded in putting it out of the way, saying to himself\r\nloud enough to be heard by me, as he laid it down, \"now you can't\r\nupset any body!\" Pleased with the incident, I asked the man if he\r\noften travelled that road. \"No, sir,\" said he. \"Why, then, did you\r\ntake so much trouble to remove that large stone?\" \"Because, sir,\"\r\nreturned he, \"it might have upset some one in the night!\" I then\r\nleft him, reflecting that if all our politicians had a full portion\r\nof the same public spirit, and all our self-righteous persons as\r\nmuch of a desire to do good to their fellow men as this poor negro\r\nexhibited--we should have a very different time of it!\r\n\r\n[_Niles's Reg._\r\n\r\n_Winter Butter._--An idea prevails very extensively, that _good\r\nbutter_ cannot be made in the winter. This is a great mistake. Where\r\nthe process is well understood, as fine butter is made in the depths\r\nof winter, as at any season of the year. By pursuing the following\r\ncourse, the matter will be accomplished:--\r\n\r\nLet the cows be kept under cover in a warm stable, well fed with\r\nthe best hay and provender, and milked regularly morning and\r\nevening.--Place the milk in pans, in as cold a place as may be found\r\nabout the dairy house--the sooner it freezes the better. As soon as\r\nit is frozen thoroughly, take the cream from the top--the frost will\r\nforce the cream to the surface--and churn it with no other warmth\r\nthan the air of the kitchen at the distance of eight or ten feet\r\nfrom the fire-place. It requires more time to fetch the butter than\r\nin summer; but when brought it will be of the finest flavour and\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n_The Diamond._--Dr. Brewster has discovered a curious phenomenon,\r\nwhich appears to elucidate the nature of this substance. Sir Isaac\r\nNewton observed, from a comparison of the refractive powers of\r\nvarious bodies, that amber and the diamond had a refractive power\r\nthree times greater, in respect of their densities, than several\r\nother substances, and he conjectured that the diamond was \"probably\r\nan unctuous substance coagulated.\" Subsequent discoveries of the\r\nproperties of sulphur and phosphorous have corroborated this\r\nopinion. Dr. Brewster has observed, both in flat diamonds and those\r\nof a perfect crystalline form (as well as in amber,) the existence\r\nof globules, or small portions of air, the expansive force of which\r\nhas communicated a polarizing structure to the parts in immediate\r\ncontact with it. This structure is displayed by four sectors of\r\npolarizing light encircling the globule of air, and can be produced\r\nartificially in glass and gelatinous masses. It must have been\r\nproduced by the expansive force of the included air, when the\r\nsubstance was so soft as to be susceptible of comparison from so\r\nsmall a force. Hence we are led to the conclusion that the diamond\r\noriginates, like amber, from the consolidation of perhaps vegetable\r\nmatter, gradually acquiring a crystalline form, by the influence of\r\ntime, and the slow action of corpsular forces.\r\n\r\n_White Hills._--The White Hills in New Hampshire, are the highest in\r\nthe United States, being between 7 and 8000 feet above the level of\r\nthe ocean. The ascent is both difficult and dangerous, as the sides\r\nof the mountains consist of naked, rugged, and precipitous rocks\r\nover which the traveller is obliged to climb his slow and toilsome\r\nway. The last of July and the first of August is the only time at\r\nwhich they can be ascended at all, as they are the rest of the year\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\n_Sizing._--A French chemist has recently discovered, that from\r\nthe starch of potatoes quite fresh, and washed but once, a fine\r\n_size_, by mixing with chalk, might be made. The stucco plasterers\r\nof this country have been benefited by the discovery, and they find\r\nthat this kind of size is particularly useful for ceilings and for\r\nwhite-washing, being more durable in tenacity and whiteness, and not\r\nputrifying like animal size or exhaling any unwholesome odour.\r\n\r\n_Arabian Horses._--Three fine Arabian horses have arrived at Boston\r\nfrom Tripoli. They are owned by R. B. Jones, Esq. late American\r\nConsul at that place, and a Mr. Morgan.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting Wheat._--In the month of August, 1795, a gentleman of\r\nHerefordshire, in England, set a single grain of wheat. As soon as\r\nit had properly taken root, he dug it up, divided it into several\r\nparts, and transplanted them. In August 1796, it was reaped, when it\r\nproduced 137 ears; the average of which was 80 grains in the ear;\r\nthe total produce 10,960 grains of wheat, besides the straw, most of\r\nwhich was seven feet high.\r\n\r\n_Fall of a Glacier._--On the 27th of December, at six o'clock in the\r\nmorning, an enormous portion of the glacier of Weisshorn, in the\r\nvalley of St. Nicholas, or Vispach, fell from its exalted situation\r\ninto the valley, causing dreadful devastation amongst the cultivated\r\ngrounds and habitations. At the moment when the ice and snow struck\r\nthe masses lying beneath, the minister of the place, and many other\r\npersons, observed a strong light, which immediately disappeared,\r\nand gave place to utter darkness. This phenomenon, from the\r\nbrightness of the light, and the number of persons who saw it, can\r\nscarcely be considered as illusory. It was probably an electrical\r\nor phosphorescent effect. The mass of ice and snow covered a space\r\nof 2400 feet in length, 1000 feet wide, and at a mean 150 feet in\r\nheight, and the displacement of the air by it was such as to cause\r\na hurricane, which destroyed houses, mills, and buildings, even to\r\nthe distance of a quarter of a league from the place of the fall.\r\nExtreme fears are entertained for the remains of the village of\r\nRonds, which stands opposite the glacier, for the upper part of the\r\nglacier, left unsupported by the part which has given way, threatens\r\nto fall and complete the distress which has been brought upon the\r\ninhabitants of the valley.\r\n\r\n_Evolution of Heat by freezing._--M. de la Becha has devised\r\nan ingenious way of shewing the heat evolved by water during\r\ncongelation. He places a glass vessel, containing in its lower part\r\nwater, and upon that olive oil, in a temperature below the freezing\r\npoint of water. In this temperature olive oil alone would freeze\r\nand thicken, but, being placed over water, it is retained in the\r\nfluid state, in consequence of the heat evolved by the water during\r\nits conversion into ice; and it is not until the whole of the water\r\nis perfectly frozen that the oil itself will freeze.--_Bibliotheque\r\nUniverselle_, xiii. 76.\r\n\r\n_Printing in Otaheite._--M. Turgenieff, Counsellor of State, has\r\nmade a report to the Bible Society of Petersburg, in which it is\r\nstated that the English missionaries, have established a press at\r\nOtaheite, at which 3000 bibles have been printed. They were all sold\r\nin the space of three days, for three gallons of cocoa-nut oil each.\r\nThe books of Moses, translated into the Otaheitean language, have\r\nbeen printed at the same press; also a catechism for the use of the\r\ninhabitants. These have been distributed gratuitously.\r\n\r\n_Animal Magnetism._--The Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin have\r\nproposed animal magnetism as a prize subject, essays on which are\r\nto be rewarded in August 1820. It is desired that the phenomena,\r\nknown by the name of animal magnetism, be described so as to admit\r\nof a positive judgment respecting their nature: and it is observed\r\nthat, though there are many difficulties attached to the subject,\r\nstill it appears that the number of facts ascertained is such as to\r\nadmit the hope that, in the present state of the physical sciences,\r\nsome light may be thrown on animal magnetism, when the probability\r\nof these facts has been estimated, and when their analogy with the\r\nbetter understood phenomena of natural sleep, dreams, somnambulism\r\nnot magnetic, and many nervous affections, has been established.\r\n\r\n_Milk._--Professor Schubler has published in the Dictionary of\r\nMedical Sciences, a paper entitled, \"Researches on Milk and its\r\nconstituent Principles.\" The results of his analysis differ greatly\r\nfrom those lately published by Berzelius; and hence, in the\r\nauthor's opinion, prove the great influence of food and climate on\r\nthe lacteal secretion. 1000 parts of new milk contain 110 of fresh\r\ncheese, 50 of fresh _serai_, 24 of butter, 77 of coarse sugar of\r\nmilk, and 739 water; or, in a dry state, 42.6 cheese, 7.87 _serai_,\r\n24.0 butter, 77.0 sugar of milk, and 848.53 water. 1000 parts of\r\nskimmed milk contain 43.64 dry cheese, 8.06 dry _serai_, 78.94\r\nsugar of milk, and 869.34 water. 1000 parts of cream contain 240\r\nbutter, 33 cheese, 6 _serai_, and 721 whey. Lastly, 721 parts of\r\nwhey contain 60 coarse sugar of milk.--These observations were made\r\nat Howfyl, which is some distance from the mountains, and where the\r\ncows are kept constantly in the stable, so that the milk must be\r\nnearly the same as in other flat countries.\r\n\r\n_Respiration and Circulation of the Blood._--Dr. Carson has lately\r\nmade some important experiments on the elasticity of the lungs in\r\ndifferent animals, and he has found by the application of a simple\r\napparatus that in oxen, and animals of their size, it is more than\r\nequal in power to the weight of a column of water a foot and a\r\nhalf high. In calves, sheep, and large dogs, it is balanced by a\r\ncolumn of water varying in height from one foot to a foot and a\r\nhalf; and in rabbits and cats by a column of water varying from six\r\nto ten inches. To this elasticity of the lungs alternating with\r\nthe irritability of the diaphragm, Dr. C. ascribes respiration, or\r\nthe faculty of breathing; the capacity of the chest being by their\r\nmeans successively enlarged and diminished, and thus air alternately\r\nexpelled and inhaled. He thinks also with great probability that\r\nthe movements of the heart and the circulation of the blood are\r\npowerfully influenced by the same resilisency.\r\n\r\n_Beccaria._--This philosopher of humanity having, in one of\r\nthe editions of his admirable work on crimes and punishments,\r\nin that part which relates to fraudulent bankruptcy, qualified\r\nsome sentiments which he had originally expressed, but which, on\r\nreflection, appeared to himself too severe, he adds in a note, \"I\r\nam ashamed of what I formerly wrote on this subject. I have been\r\naccused of irreligion, without deserving it; I have been accused of\r\ndisaffection to the government, and deserved it as little; I was\r\nguilty of a real attack upon the rights of humanity, and _I have\r\nbeen reproached by nobody_.\"\r\n\r\n_Generosity._--It is an error to imagine that men in the lowest rank\r\nof life are unsusceptible of heroic and generous sentiments. All\r\nwho are susceptible of enthusiasm are capable of being actuated by\r\nthem. It is the minions of fortune, those who have been pampered\r\nfrom their infancy, by the hands of luxury, and early accustomed\r\nto every kind of profusion, whose minds sink into torpor for\r\nwant of exertion; it is such as those that are more likely to be\r\nunsusceptible of generous sentiments.\r\n\r\n_Academy of Natural Sciences._--The Academy of Natural Sciences in\r\nthis city has received from the president, Mr. William Maclure, now\r\nin France, a donation of books, amounting in value to about $4000,\r\nand have received advice of another valuable shipment from the same\r\nmunificent hand.\r\n\r\n_Method of preserving Vessels._--An American ship now at Cowes,\r\nbuilt with spruce and white oak, sixteen years ago, has all\r\nher original timbers and planks in the most perfect state of\r\npreservation and soundness, owing to her having been, while on the\r\nstocks, filled up between the timbers with salt; and whenever she\r\nhas been opened for examination filled up again.\r\n\r\n_General Post-Office._--The number of post-offices in the United\r\nStates is four thousand eight hundred and thirty, and the length\r\nof post-roads is 71,522 miles. The amount of postage for the\r\nyear 1819, was $1,204,680; the cost of transportation of the mail\r\n$717,843; and the compensation to postmasters $375,964.\r\n\r\n_Bibliomania._--At no time during the highest age of Bibliomanianism\r\ndid books of rarity bear higher prices than at the concluding sale\r\nof Mr. Bindley's library. The competition for old poetical tracts\r\nand ballads was unexampled.\r\n\r\n                                         _L._ _s._ _d._\r\n  No. 1125 Collection of Poetical Ballads\r\n  from 1540 to 1670.                        192  0  0\r\n       1126 Do. from 1670 to 1680,          133 15  0\r\n       1127 Do. from 1679 to 1685,          174  6  0\r\n       1128 Do. 5 vols.                     231  0  0\r\n       1130 Do.                              43  1  0\r\n\r\nThe three first collections of ballads, and of halfpenny and penny\r\nsongs, were bought by the Marquis of Buckingham. The five volumes of\r\nthe same kind by Mr. Heber.\r\n\r\n[_Lon. pap._\r\n\r\n_Precious Stones._--A diamond said to be worth 20,000_l._ and one\r\nof the largest in the world, was among the spoils of the Peishwa,\r\nand is now in the East India Company's treasury, to be sold for the\r\nbenefit of the captors. It was brought to England by the ship York.\r\nA block of amethyst, or rather a mass of amethysts, has been sent\r\nfrom Brazil to Calcutta. This extraordinary specimen is four feet\r\nin circumference, and weighs 98 pounds. It is in its rough state,\r\nand consists of more than 50 irregular columns, smooth, transparent,\r\npurple and white, shooting up like crystals from a common matrix.\r\n\r\n_Nautical Improvement._--We congratulate the public on the\r\napplication of a simple mechanical apparatus to impel boats, instead\r\nof oars. It consists of the machinery of steam-vessels, but the\r\nmoving power is the hand applied to a windlass. Boats were first\r\nused on this principle with success on Whit-Monday, between London\r\nand Greenwich. The labour is much less than that of oars, and the\r\nimpulse of the boat through the water much increased in swiftness.\r\n\r\n_Philosophic Girl._--The Italian journals mention that a young lady,\r\nonly 13 years of age, named Maria Catherina Gherardi, a native of\r\nScrola, has maintained in public a series of philosophic theses, in\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\n_Ingenious Automaton._--A German journal asserts, that an artist\r\nat Cemberg, in Prussia, has constructed a watch which imitates the\r\nhuman voice, and answers questions in German and Polish; besides\r\nexecuting musical airs.\r\n\r\n_To destroy Caterpillars._--A gardener at Glasgow practices a mode\r\nof destroying caterpillars, which he discovered by accident. A piece\r\nof woollen rag had been blown by the wind into a currant bush, and\r\nwhen taken out was found covered with these leaf-devouring insects.\r\nHe immediately placed pieces of woollen cloth in every bush in his\r\ngarden, and found next day that the caterpillars had universally\r\ntaken to them for shelter. In this way he destroys many thousands\r\nevery morning.\r\n\r\n_Vegetation in cold Climates._--The following is a calendar of a\r\nSiberian Lapland year:\r\n\r\n  Snow melts              June 22d.\r\n  Snow gone               July 1st.\r\n  Fields quite green       do. 6th.\r\n  Plants at full growth    do. 17th.\r\n  Plants in flower         do. 25th.\r\n  Fruits ripe             Aug. 2d.\r\n  Plants shed their seed   do. 10th.\r\n  Snow                     do. 18th.\r\n  From August 18th to June 22d.\r\n  snow and ice.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that from their first emerging from the ground\r\nto the ripening of their seeds, the plants take but a month; and\r\nspring, summer, and autumn are crowded into the short space of 56\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER'S CREED.\r\n\r\n_By Sir John Sinclair, President of the Board of Agriculture._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let this be held the Farmer's creed.\r\n    For stock, seek out the choicest breed,\r\n    In peace and plenty let them feed.\r\n    Your land sow with the best of seed,\r\n    Let it nor dung, nor dressing need,\r\n    Enclose and drain it with all speed,\r\n    And you will soon be rich indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other paths to the temple of fame, than those which lead\r\nthrough blood and slaughter. This truth cannot too frequently be\r\ninculcated on the minds of the rising generation. Our own country\r\nkeeps pace with the nations of the old world, in applauding deeds\r\nof arms; apparently forgetful of the fact, that there are other\r\nincentives to ambition, of a much more useful and honourable\r\ncharacter. He who augments the stock of public happiness, by\r\nimproving the condition of his fellow creatures, or enriches the\r\nnation by developing her resources, is entitled to her thanks,\r\nand will probably receive them: At all events he will reap with\r\ncertainty the high reward of self-approbation. The following stanzas\r\nto the memory of the late Duke of Bridgewater, were written by one\r\nwho enjoys the rare distinction of being at once a painter and a\r\npoet, of no ordinary pretensions. What ample scope is furnished\r\nto Pennsylvania, and what cogent inducements may be found in the\r\nexample of some of her neighbours, for adopting zealously, without\r\nfurther delay, a great and efficient plan of INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT.\r\nShould she evince the public spirit of Bridgewater, a Brindley will\r\nno doubt be found, to aid her in the important object of uniting\r\nthe waters of the Ohio and the Delaware. This would add one more to\r\nthe catalogue of those pacific but glorious triumphs, which have\r\nrendered her name celebrated throughout the civilized world. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER.\r\n\r\nFrom Shee's \"Rhymes on Art.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shall EGERTON[7] depart without a tear?\r\n    And press in silent state a plumeless bier?\r\n    No, though his tomb no martial glories grace,\r\n    No trophies won in wild Ambition's race;\r\n    Though no vain pen on History's pompous page\r\n    Paint the deep statesman to th' astonish'd age;\r\n    Lay open all the labyrinth of his breast--\r\n    What plans he form'd--what factions he suppress'd;\r\n    What flames of war broke forth as he desir'd--\r\n    Cool'd as he calm'd, or kindled as he fir'd;\r\n    Yet life's mild Arts their spotless ensigns wave,\r\n    And grateful swains strow garlands on his grave.\r\n    Though crown'd with all in rank, or wealth that charms,\r\n    And lulls th' enfeebled soul in Pleasure's arms,\r\n    Behold him, yet in man's meridian hour,\r\n    Fly the false glare of pomp, and pride, and pow'r;\r\n    Decline the Court's intrigues, the Senate's, strife,\r\n    To serve his country in secluded life;\r\n    To ope new arteries of public health,\r\n    Promote her pride and circulate her wealth;\r\n    Call forth a BRINDLEY'S genius, and command,\r\n    To pierce opposing mountains with his wand,\r\n    Through wondering vales, in liquid course to lead\r\n    Commercial keels, and navigate the mead;\r\n    Bid in bright tracks obedient currents glide,\r\n    And, like a river-god, direct the tide.\r\n\r\n  [7] The late Duke of Bridgewater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITTEN.\r\n\r\nBy Joanna Baillie.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wanton drole, whose harmless play\r\n    Beguiles the rustic's closing day,\r\n    When drawn the evening fire about,\r\n    Sit aged Crone and thoughtless Lout,\r\n    And child upon his three-foot stool,\r\n    Waiting till his supper cool;\r\n    And Maid whose cheek outblooms the rose,\r\n    As bright the blazing faggot glows,\r\n    Who, bending to the friendly light,\r\n    Plies her task with busy sleight;\r\n    Come, show thy tricks and sportive graces,\r\n    Thus circled round with merry faces.\r\n      Backward coil'd and couching low,\r\n    With glaring eyeballs watch thy foe,\r\n    The housewife's spindle whirling round,\r\n    Or thread, or straw, that on the ground\r\n    Its shadow throws, by urchin sly\r\n    Held out to lure thy roving eye;\r\n    Then, onward stealing fiercely spring\r\n    Upon the futile, faithless thing.\r\n    Now, wheeling round with bootless skill,\r\n    Thy bo-peep tail provokes thee still,\r\n    As oft beyond thy curving side\r\n    Its getty tip is seen to glide;\r\n    Till from thy centre starting far\r\n    Thou sidelong rear'st with rump in air,\r\n    Erected stiff, and gait awry,\r\n    Like Madam in her tantrums high:\r\n    Though ne'er a Madam of them all,\r\n    Whose silken kirtle sweeps the hall,\r\n    More varied trick and whim displays,\r\n    To catch the admiring stranger's gaze.\r\n      Doth power in measured verses dwell,\r\n    All thy vagaries wild to tell?\r\n    Ah no! the start, the jet, the bound,\r\n    The giddy scamper round and round,\r\n    With leap, and jerk, and high curvet,\r\n    And many a whirling somerset,\r\n    (Permitted by the modern Muse\r\n    Expression technical to use,)\r\n    These mock the deftest rhymester's skill,\r\n    But poor in art, though rich in will.\r\n      The featest tumbler, stage-bedight,\r\n    To thee is but a clumsy wight,\r\n    Who every limb and sinew strains\r\n    To do what costs thee little pains,\r\n    For which, I trow, the gaping crowd\r\n    Requites him oft with plaudits loud;\r\n    But, stopped the while thy wanton play,\r\n    Applauses, too, thy feats repay;\r\n    For then beneath some urchin's hand,\r\n    With modest pride thou tak'st thy stand,\r\n    While many a stroke of fondness glides\r\n    Along thy back and tabby sides.\r\n    Dilated swells thy glossy fur,\r\n    And loudly sings thy busy pur;\r\n    As timing well the equal sound,\r\n    Thy clutching feet bepat the ground,\r\n    And all their harmless claws disclose,\r\n    Like prickles of an early rose;\r\n    While softly from thy whiskered cheek\r\n    Thy half-closed eyes peer mild and meek.\r\n      But, not alone by cottage fire\r\n    Do rustics rude thy feats admire;\r\n    The learned sage, whose thoughts explore\r\n    The widest range of human lore,\r\n    Or, with unfettered fancy, fly\r\n    Through airy heights of poesy,\r\n    Pausing, smiles with altered air\r\n    To see thee climb his elbow chair,\r\n    Or, struggling on the mat below,\r\n    Hold warfare with his slipper'd toe.\r\n    The widow'd dame, or lonely maid,\r\n    Who in the still but cheerless shade\r\n    Of home unsocial, spends her age,\r\n    And rarely turns a lettered page;\r\n    Upon her hearth for thee lets fall\r\n    The rounded cork, or paper ball,\r\n    Nor chides thee on thy wicked watch\r\n    The ends of ravelled skein to catch,\r\n    Buts lets thee have thy wayward will,\r\n    Perplexing oft her sober skill.\r\n    Even he, whose mind of gloomy bent,\r\n    In lonely tower or prison pent,\r\n    Reviews the wit of former days,\r\n    And loaths the world and all its ways;\r\n    What time the lamps unsteady gleam\r\n    Doth rouse him from his moody dream,\r\n    Feels as thou gambol'st round his seat,\r\n    His heart with pride less fiercely beat,\r\n    And smiles, a link in thee to find\r\n    That joins him to his living kind.\r\n      Whence hast thou then, thou witless puss,\r\n    The magic power to charm us thus?\r\n    Is it, that in thy glaring eye,\r\n    And rapid movements, we descry,\r\n    While we at ease, secure from ill,\r\n    The chimney corner snugly fill,\r\n    A lion, darting on his prey,\r\n    A tiger, at his ruthless play?\r\n    Or, is it that in thee we trace,\r\n    With all thy varied wanton grace,\r\n    An emblem view'd with kindred eye,\r\n    Of tricksey, restless infancy?\r\n    Ah! many a lightly-sportive child,\r\n    Who hath, like thee our wits beguil'd,\r\n    To dull and sober manhood grown,\r\n    With strange recoil our hearts disown.\r\n    Even so, poor Kit! must thou endure,\r\n    When thou becom'st a cat demure,\r\n    Full many a cuff, and angry word,\r\n    Chid roughly from the tempting board,\r\n    And yet for that, thou hast, I ween,\r\n    So oft our favoured playmate been,\r\n    Soft be the change which thou shalt prove,\r\n    When time hath spoil'd thee of our love;\r\n    Still be thou deemed by housewife fat,\r\n    A comely, careful, mousing cat;\r\n    Whose dish is for the public good,\r\n    Replenish'd oft with sav'ry food.\r\n      Nor when thy span of life is past,\r\n    Be thou to pond or dunghill cast,\r\n    But gently borne on good man's spade,\r\n    Beneath the decent sod be laid,\r\n    And children show with glist'ning eyes,\r\n    The place where poor old Pussy lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUTUMNAL TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O Father, dear Father! lament now with me,\r\n      This morning I've been at our wood,\r\n    And the fine flowing leaves of your favourite tree,\r\n      Around on the grass are all strew'd;\r\n    And sure 'tis a pity! for lovely and green,\r\n      All summer they yielded a shade,\r\n    Dear Father, to you, who against it would lean,\r\n      While sister and I round it play'd.\r\n\r\n    Of late they began to change colour indeed,\r\n      Like the corn when 'tis ripe in the field;\r\n    And the dark glossy green became yellow and red,\r\n      As if they ripe berries would yield.\r\n    I thought this was pretty, and ne'er heard you say\r\n      That the leaves would soon fall from the tree;\r\n    And I never was happier than t'other fine day,\r\n      When you looked there at sister and me.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Why, my boy, I am grieved at the tale you have told,\r\n      But the leaves every year drop around--\r\n    They are green in their youth, and turn red when they're old,\r\n      Then the wind blows them down to the ground.\r\n    But take comfort, my boy--when the winter is fled,\r\n      The leaves will appear on the tree,\r\n    And again form a bower thy father to shade,\r\n      And the gambols of sister and thee.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Why, that's good--but, my father, I've sad news to tell;\r\n      Old William, who liv'd at Hillside,\r\n    And lately came hither so wan and so pale,\r\n      Old William this morning hath died.\"\r\n    \"Old William hath died! Ah! indeed, I am sad;\r\n      But age, when it ripens, must fall,\r\n    Though green was his summer, his autumn must fade;\r\n      Such, my boy, is the end of us all.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Then he fell like the leaves of your favourite tree,\r\n      But when the long winter is o'er,\r\n    Old William again on the hills shall we see\r\n      A feeding his flock as before?\"\r\n    \"Ah, no! my sweet boy!--the dead wander no more\r\n      In the bounds of this wind-wasted scene;\r\n    But to regions immortal all good spirits soar,\r\n      More lovely, more lasting, and green.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK NOTE EXCHANGE,\r\n\r\nAT PHILADELPHIA--_Oct. 28, 1820_.\r\n\r\n                         Per cent Disc't.\r\n\r\n  VERMONT--generally,                          3\r\n  MAINE,--generally,                           4\r\n  NEW HAMPSHIRE--generally,                    2\r\n  CONNECTICUT--generally,                    2-3\r\n  NEW YORK,--City Bank,                     par.\r\n      Country generally,                     1-5\r\n      J.
