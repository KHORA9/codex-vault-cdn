Wickson\r\n\r\nProfessor of Horticulture, University of California; Editor of Pacific\r\nRural Press; Author of \"California Fruits and How to Grow Them\" and\r\n\"California Vegetables in Garden and Field,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeword\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brochure is not a systematic treatise in catechetical form intended\r\nto cover what the writer holds to be most important to know about\r\nCalifornia agricultural practices. It is simply a classified arrangement\r\nof a thousand or more questions which have been actually asked, and to\r\nwhich answers have been undertaken through the columns of the Pacific\r\nRural Press, a weekly journal of agriculture published in San Francisco.\r\nWhatever value is claimed for the work is based upon the assumption that\r\ninformation, which about seven hundred people have actually asked for,\r\nwould be also interesting and helpful to thousands of other people. If\r\nyou do not find in this compilation what you desire to know, submit your\r\nquestion to the Pacific Rural Press, San Francisco, in the columns of\r\nwhich answers to agricultural questions are weekly set forth at the rate\r\nof five hundred or more each year.\r\n\r\nThis publication is therefore intended to answer a thousand questions\r\nfor you and to encourage you to ask a thousand more.\r\n\r\nE.

Fruit Growing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepth of Soil for Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould four feet of good loose soil be enough for lemons?\r\n\r\nFour feet of good soil, providing the underlying strata are not charged\r\nwith alkali, would give you a good growth of lemon trees if moisture was\r\nregularly present in about the right quantity, neither too much nor too\r\nlittle, and the temperature conditions were favorable to the success of\r\nthis tree, which will not stand as much frost as the orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperatures for Citrus Fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the lowest temperature at which grapefruit and lemons will\r\nsucceed?\r\n\r\nThe grapefruit tree is about as hardy as the orange; the lemon is much\r\nmore tender. The fruit of citrus trees will be injured by temperature at\r\nthe ordinary freezing point if continued for some little time, and the\r\ntree itself is likely to be injured by a temperature of 25 or 27° if\r\ncontinued for a few hours. The matter of duration of a low temperature\r\nis perhaps quite as important as the degree which is actually reached by\r\nthe thermometer. The condition of the tree as to being dormant or active\r\nalso affects injury by freezing temperatures. Under certain conditions\r\nan orange tree may survive a temperature of 15° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoots for Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to bud from certain trees that nurseries probably do not carry,\r\nas they came from a seedling. Is there more than one variety of\r\nmyrobalan used, and if so, is one as good as another? If I take sprouts\r\nthat come up where the roots have been cut, will they make good trees? I\r\nhave tried a few, now three years old, and the trees are doing nicely so\r\nfar, but the roots sprout up where cut. I am informed that if I can\r\nraise them from slips they will not sprout up from the root. Will\r\napricots and peaches grafted or budded on myrobalan produce fruit as\r\nlarge as they will if grafted on their own stock?\r\n\r\nExperience seems to be clear that from sprouts you will get sprouts. We\r\nprefer rooted cuttings to sprouts, but even these are abandoned for\r\nseedling roots of the common deciduous fruits and of citrus fruits also.\r\nThe apricot does well enough on the myrobalan if the soil needs that\r\nroot; they are usually larger on the peach root or on apricot seedlings.\r\nThe peach is no longer worked on the myrobalan in this State. One\r\nseedling of the cherry plum is about as good a myrobalan as another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Will the Sucker Be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a Japanese plum tree which bears choice plums. Three years ago a\r\nstrong young shoot came up from the root of it, which I dug out and\r\nplanted. Will it make a bearing tree in time and be of like quality with\r\nthe parent?\r\n\r\nIt will certainly bear something when it gets ready. Whether it will be\r\nlike the parent tree depends upon the wood from which the sucker broke\r\nout. If the young tree was budded very low, or if it was planted low, or\r\nif the ground has been shifted so as to bring the wood above the bud in\r\na place to root a sucker, the fruit will be that of the parent tree. If\r\nthe shoot came from the root below the bud, you will get a duplication\r\nof whatever stock the plum was budded on in the nursery. It might be a\r\npeach or an almond or a cherry plum. Of course you can study the foliage\r\nand wood growth of the sucker, and thus get an idea of what you may\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTree Planting on Coast Sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to plant fruit trees on a sandy mesa well protected from winds\r\nabout a mile from the coast. The soil is a light sandy loam. I intend to\r\ndig the holes for the trees this fall, each hole the shape of an\r\ninverted cone, about 4 feet deep and 5 feet across, and put a half-load\r\nof rotten stable manure in each hole this fall. The winter's rains would\r\nwash a large amount of plant food from this manure into the ground. In\r\nMarch I propose to plant the trees, shoveling the surrounding soil on\r\ntop of the manure and giving a copious watering to ensure the compact\r\nsettling of the soil about and below the roots. The roots would be about\r\na foot above the manure.\r\n\r\nOn such a light sandy soil you can use stable manure more safely than\r\nyou could elsewhere, providing you have water handy to use if you should\r\nhappen to get too much coarse matter under the tree, which would cause\r\ndrying out of the soil. If you do get plenty of water to guard against\r\nthis danger, you are likely to use too much and cause the trees to grow\r\ntoo fast. Be very sure the manure is well rotted and use one load to ten\r\nholes instead of two. Whether you kill the trees or cause them to grow\r\naright depends upon how you use water after planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wrong Idea of Inter-Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat forage plant can I grow in a newly planted orchard? The soil is on\r\na gently inclined hillside - red, decomposed rock, very deep, mellow,\r\nfluffy, and light, and deep down is clayish in character. It cannot be\r\nirrigated, therefore I wish to put out a drought-resisting plant which\r\ncould be harvested, say, in June or July, or even later. I find the\r\nfollowing plants, but I cannot decide which one is the best: Yellow soja\r\nbean, speltz, Egyptian corn, Jerusalem corn, yellow Milo maize, or one\r\nof the millets. What do you think?\r\n\r\nDo not think for a moment about planting any such plant between orchard\r\ntrees which are to subsist on rainfall without irrigation. Your trees\r\nwill have difficulty enough in making satisfactory growth on rainfall,\r\nand would be prevented from doing so if they had to divide the soil\r\nmoisture with crops planted between them. The light, deep soils which\r\nyou mention, resulting from decomposed rock, are not retentive enough,\r\nand, even with the large rainfall of your region, may require irrigation\r\nto carry trees through the latter summer and early fall growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Slopes for Fruit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to plant some apples and berries. One man says plant them on the\r\neast or south slope of the hill and they will be ripe early. Another man\r\nsays not to do that, for when the sun hits the trees or vines in the\r\nmorning before the frost is off, it will kill all the blossoms, and as\r\nthey would be on the warm side of the hill they would blossom earlier\r\nand there will be more frosts to injure them. I am told to plant them on\r\nthe north or west side of the hill, where it is cold, and they will\r\nblossom later and will therefore have less frosts to bother them, and\r\nthe frost will be almost off before the sun hits them in the morning.\r\n\r\nFruit is grown on all slopes in our foothills, depending on local\r\nconditions. On the whole, we should choose the east and north slopes\r\nrather than the east and south, because there is less danger of injury\r\nfrom too great heat. In some cases what is said to you about the less\r\ndanger of injury from frosts on the north and west slopes would be true.\r\nAll these things depend upon local conditions, because there is so much\r\ndifference in heat and frost and similar slopes at different elevations\r\nand exposures. There can never be a general rule for it in a State so\r\nendowed with varying conditions as California is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees Over Underflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have planted fruit trees near the creek, where they do not have to be\r\nirrigated as the ground there holds sufficient moisture for them, but a\r\nneighbor tells me that on account of the moisture being so near the\r\nsurface the trees will not bear fruit well, although they will grow and\r\nhave all the appearances of health.\r\n\r\nShallow soil above standing water is not good for fruit trees. A shallow\r\nsoil over moving water or underflow, such as you might expect from a\r\ncreek bank, is better. The effect of water near the surface depends also\r\nupon the character of the soil, being far more dangerous in the case of\r\na heavy clay soil than in the case of a light loam, through which water\r\nmoves more readily and does not rise so far or so rapidly by capillary\r\naction. If the trees are thrifty they will bear when they attain a\r\nsufficient age and stop the riotous growth which is characteristic of\r\nyoung trees with abundant moisture. If trees have too much water for\r\ntheir health, it will be manifested by the rotting of their roots, the\r\ndying of their branches, the cropping out of mushroom fungi at the base\r\nand other manifestations of distress. So long as the tree is growing\r\nwell, maintains good foliage to the tip of the branches and is otherwise\r\napparently strong, it may be expected to bear fruit in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"June Drop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending four peaches which are falling off the trees. Can you tell\r\nme how to prevent falling of the fruit next year and what causes it?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell from the peaches which you send what caused\r\ntheir falling. Where fruit passes the pollination stage successfully, as\r\nthese fruits have, the dropping is generally attributed to some\r\nconditions affecting the growth of the tree, which never have been fully\r\ndetermined. It is of such frequent occurrence that it is called the June\r\ndrop, and it usually takes place in May in California. As the cause is\r\nnot understood no rational preventive has been reached. A general\r\ntreatment which consists in keeping the trees in good growing condition\r\nlate enough during the previous season, that is, by seeing to it that\r\nthey do not suffer from lack of moisture which causes them to close\r\ntheir growing season too soon before preparation for the following\r\nyear's crop is made, is probably the best way to strengthen the tree for\r\nits burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees Over a Gravel Streak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an apricot orchard seven years old. Most of the land is a fairly\r\nheavy clay with a strip of gravel in the middle running nearly north and\r\nsouth. The trees on the clay bear good crops, but those on the gravel\r\nare usually much lighter in bearing and this year had a very light crop.\r\nCan you tell me of anything I can do to make them bear? The trees are\r\nlarge and healthy looking, and grow big crops of brush.\r\n\r\nWe should try some water in July on the gravel streak, hoping to\r\ncontinue activity in the tree later to induce formation of strong fruit\r\nfor the following year. On the clay loam the soil does this by its\r\nsuperior retentiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit and Overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 16 acres of rich bottom-land that overflows and is under water\r\nfrom 24 to 48 hours. I would like to set the ground to fruit trees,\r\neither prunes, pears, apricots, or peaches. Would it be safe to set them\r\non such land?\r\n\r\nFruit trees will endure overflowing, providing the water does not\r\nexclude the air too long and providing the soil is free enough so that\r\nthe soil does not remain full of water after the surface flow\r\ndisappears. If the soil does not naturally drain itself and the water is\r\nforced to escape by surface evaporation, probably the situation is not\r\nsatisfactory for any kind of fruit trees. Overflow is more likely to be\r\ndangerous to fruit trees during the growing season than during the\r\ndormant season, and yet on well-drained soil even a small overflow may\r\nnot be injurious on a free soil, if not continued too long. Prunes on\r\nplum root, and pears will endure wet soil better than apricots or\r\npeaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Trees and Sunburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long is it wise to leave protection around young fruit trees set out\r\nin March in this hot valley? The trees are doing well, but we could not\r\ntell when to take away protection.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to maintain the protection from sunburn all through the\r\nautumn, for the autumn sun is often very hot, and as the sap flow\r\nlessens, the danger of burning is apparently greater. The bark also must\r\nbe protected against the spring sunshine, even before the leaves appear.\r\nSo long as the sun has a chance at the bark, you must protect it from\r\nsunburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReplanting in Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it considered a good plan to set the tree at once in the place where\r\none has died, or is it better to wait a year before replacing?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to wait a year in making a replanting. Get out all\r\nthe old roots you can by digging a large hole, fill in with fresh soil,\r\nand your tree will accept the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhole Roots or Piece Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor commercial apple orchards which is preferable, trees grafted on\r\npiece roots or on whole roots? On behalf of the piece-root trees it is\r\nclaimed they sprout up less around the tree. On the other hand, it is\r\nclaimed they never make a vigorous tree. What is the truth?\r\n\r\nValue depends rather upon what sort of a growth the tree makes afterward\r\nthan upon what it starts upon. Theoretically perhaps a whole-root tree\r\nmay be demonstrated to be better; practically, we cannot see that it\r\nbecomes so necessarily, because we have trees planted at a time when the\r\nroot graft on a piece was the general rule in propagation. After all, is\r\nit not more important to have soil conditions and culture of such\r\ncharacter that a great root can grow in the orchard than to have a whole\r\nnursery concentrated in the root of the yearling tree? As for the claim\r\nthat a root graft on a piece-root never makes a vigorous tree, we know\r\nthat is nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting Deciduous Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to gain time, I have thought of planting apples and pears this\r\nfall, in the belief I would be just that much nearer a crop, than though\r\nI waited until next spring. The land is sandy loam; no irrigation. Would\r\nyou advise fall or spring planting? If fall, would it be best to plow\r\nthe land now, turning in the stubble from hay crop, or wait until time\r\nto plant before plowing?\r\n\r\nYou will not be any nearer a crop, for next summer's growth will be the\r\nfirst in either case. On land not liable to be too wet in winter, it is,\r\nhowever, best to plant early, say during the month of December, if the\r\nground is in good condition and sufficiently moist. If the year's\r\nrainfall has been scant, wait until the land is well wet down, for it is\r\nnever desirable to plant when the soil is not in the right condition, no\r\nmatter what the calendar may say. On a sandy loam early planting is\r\nnearly always safe and desirable. On lands which are too wet and liable\r\nto be rendered very cold by the heavy January rains, planting had better\r\nbe deferred until February, or as soon as the ground gets in good\r\ncondition after these heavy rains. Whenever you plant, it will be\r\ndesirable to plow the land either in advance of the rains, if it is\r\nworkable, or as soon as rain enough comes to make it break up well. It\r\nis very seldom desirable to postpone plowing until the actual time of\r\nplanting comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better to bud in old bark of an old tree or in younger wood bark?\r\nHow do you separate old bark without breaking it in lifting the bark?\r\n\r\nBuds may be placed in old bark of fruit trees to a certain extent. The\r\norange and the olive work better that way than do the deciduous trees,\r\nalthough buds in old bark of the peach have done well. They should,\r\nhowever, be inserted early in the season while the sap flow is active\r\nand the old bark capable of lifting; if the bark sticks, do not try\r\nbudding. In spite of these facts, nearly all budding of deciduous trees\r\nis done in bark of the current year's growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting Fruit Trees from Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I start, and when, the following seeds: Peach, plums,\r\napricots, walnuts, olives and cherries? In the East we used to plant\r\nthem in the fall, so as to have them freeze; as it does not freeze\r\nenough here, what do I have to do?\r\n\r\nDo just the same. In California, heat and moisture cause the parting of\r\nthe seed-cover, more slowly perhaps, but just as surely as the frost at\r\nthe East. Early planting of all fruit pits and nuts is desirable for two\r\nreasons. First, it prevents too great drying and hardening and other\r\nchanges in the seed, because the soil moisture prevents it; second, it\r\ngives plenty of time for the opening and germination first mentioned.\r\nBut early planting must be in ground which is loamy and light rather\r\nthan heavy, because if the soil is so heavy as to become water-logged\r\nthe kernel is more apt to decay than to grow. Where there is danger of\r\nthis, the seed can be kept in boxes of sand, continually moist, but not\r\nwet, by use of water, and planted out, as sprouting seeds, after the\r\ncoldest rains are over, say in February. Cherry and plum seeds should be\r\nkept moist after taking from the fruit; very little is usually had from\r\ndry seeds. The other fruits will stand considerable drying. Very few\r\nolives are from the seed, because of reversion to wild types - also\r\nbecause it is so much easier to get just the variety you want by growing\r\ntrees from cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMailing Scions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best way to send scions by mail?\r\n\r\nWax the ends of mature cuttings, remove the leaves and enclose in a\r\ntight tin canister with no wet packing material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNursery Stock in Young Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will it do to raise, for two or three years, a lot of orange\r\nseedlings between the rows of young three-year-old orange trees? I see\r\nthat a nurseryman near me has done this, and his trees are more\r\nflourishing than mine.\r\n\r\nIt can be done all right, as your own observation affirms. The superior\r\nappearance of the trees may be due to the additional water, and\r\nfertilizer probably, used to push the seedlings; possibly also to extra\r\ncultivation given them. It all depends upon what policy is observed in\r\ngrowing the seedlings; if something more than usual is done for their\r\nsakes, the trees may get their share and manifest it. If not, the trees\r\nwill be robbed by the seedlings, and there is likely to be loss by both.\r\nThere is no advantage in the mere fact that both are grown; there may be\r\nin the way they are grown. Whether there is money value in the operation\r\nor not depends upon how many undertake it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSquare or Triangular Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion on triangular planting as compared with square\r\nplanting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting in squares is the prevailing method. The triangular plan is not\r\na good one when one contemplates removing trees planted as fillers. The\r\norchard should either be planned in the square or quincunx form. In the\r\nlatter case individual trees can be easily removed; in the other case\r\nrows can be removed - leaving the rows which you wish to keep\r\nequidistant from each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKilling Stumps by Medication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill boring into green stumps and inserting a handful of saltpeter kill\r\nthe roots and cause the stump to readily burn up a few months later?\r\n\r\nWe have tried all kinds of prescriptions and have never killed a stump\r\nwhich had a mind to live. Many trees can be killed by cutting to stumps\r\nwhen in full growth, whether they are bored or not. Others will sprout\r\nin spite of all medicinal insertions we know of when these are placed in\r\nthe inner wood of the stump. We believe a stump can be killed by\r\nsufficient contact with the inner bark layer of arsenic, bluestone,\r\ngasoline, and many other things, but it is not easy to arrange for such\r\nsufficient contact, and it would probably cost more than it would to\r\nblow or pull out the stump. One reader, however, assures us that he has\r\nkilled large eucalyptus stumps by boring three holes in the stump with\r\nan inch auger, near the outer rim of the stump, placing therein a\r\ntablespoonful of potassium cyanide and saltpeter mixture (half and\r\nhalf), and plugging tightly. Another says: Give the stumps a liberal\r\napplication of salt, say a half-inch all over the top, and let the fog\r\nand rain dissolve and soak down, and you will not have much trouble with\r\nsuckers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting Fruit Trees on Clearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish to plant orchard trees on land cleared this winter: manzanita\r\nand chaparral, but also some oaks and large pines and groves of small\r\npines. We have been told that trees planted under such conditions, the\r\nground containing the many small roots that we cannot get out, would not\r\ndo well. Are the bad effects of the small roots liable to be serious;\r\nalso, would lime or any other common fertilizer counteract the bad\r\neffects?\r\n\r\nProceed with the planting, as you are ready for it, and take the chances\r\nof root injury. It may be slight; possibly even absent. Carefully throw\r\nout all root pieces, as you dig the hole, and exclude them from the\r\nearth which you use in filling around the roots, and in the places where\r\nlarge trees stood, fill the holes with soil from a distance. Much\r\ndepends upon how clean the clearing was. No considerable antiseptic\r\neffect could be expected from lime and the soil ought to be strong\r\nenough to grow good young trees without enrichment. The pear, fig and\r\nCalifornia black walnut are some of the most resistant among\r\nfruit-bearing trees, and these may usually be planted with safety. The\r\ncherry is the most resistant of the stone fruits. The \"toadstool\"\r\ndisease occasionally affects young apple trees recently set out, but it\r\nis not usually serious on established trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDipping Roots of Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn planting an almond orchard would it be of any benefit to dip the\r\nyoung trees in a solution of bluestone and lime dissolved?\r\n\r\nWe doubt if it would serve any good purpose. If done at all the dip\r\nshould be carefully prepared in accordance with the formula for bordeaux\r\nmixture, for excess of bluestone will kill roots. Healthy trees do not\r\nneed such treatment, and we doubt if unhealthy ones can be rendered safe\r\nor desirable by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing for Fruit Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat effect will a crop of wheat have on new cleared land, to be planted\r\nin fruit trees later on?\r\n\r\nOne crop of wheat or barley will make no particular difference with the\r\ncleared land which you expect to plant to fruit later. It would be\r\nbetter to grow a cultivated crop like corn, potatoes, beets, squashes,\r\netc., because this crop would require summer cultivation which would\r\nkill out many weeds or sprouts and leave your land in better shape for\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepth in Planting Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been advised to plant the bud scar above ground in a wet country.\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nOn ordinary good loam, plant the tree so that it will stand about the\r\nsame as it did in the nursery: a little lower, perhaps, but not much.\r\nThe bud scar should be a little above the surface. It is somewhat less\r\nlikely to give trouble by decay in the upset tissue. If the soil is\r\nheavy and wet, plant higher, perhaps, than the nursery soil-mark, but\r\nnot much. In light, sandy soil, plant lower - even from four to six\r\ninches lower - than in the nursery sometimes. In this case the budscar\r\nis below the surface, but that does not matter in a light, dry soil\r\nwhich does not retain moisture near the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Trees in a Wet Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne part of my orchard is low and wet, much scale and old trees loose.\r\nWill much spraying be a cure and can I use posts to hold the old trees\r\nfirm, or would you take out and put in Bartlett pears!\r\n\r\nSpraying would kill the scale but no spraying will make a tree\r\nsatisfactory in inhospitable soil. As pears will endure wet places\r\nbetter than apples, it would seem to be wise to make the substitution,\r\nproviding the situation is not too bad for any fruit tree. In that case\r\nyou can use it for a summer vegetable patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Back at Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have planted a lot of one-year-old cherry trees and would like to know\r\nif I should cut them down the same as the apple tree? I have also\r\nplanted a lot of walnut trees. Shall I cut them off?\r\n\r\nYes for the cherries and no for the walnuts - although we have to admit\r\nthat some planters hold for cutting back the walnuts also. If you do cut\r\nback the walnuts, let them have about twice the height of stem you give\r\nthe cherries and cover the exposed pith with wax or paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBranching Young Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the practice in this locality to wrap all young trees to a point\r\n24 inches above the bud, for the purpose of protection against rabbits,\r\nto protect the bark from the sun and to prevent growth of sprouts. These\r\nwrappings are kept on indefinitely, the rule being that no sprouting is\r\nto be permitted below the 24-inch murk. Is there any virtue in this, and\r\nwhy is it done?\r\n\r\nThe wrapping is desirable both to protect them from rabbits and from\r\nsunburn, and either this or whitewash or some other form of protection\r\nshould certainly be employed against the latter trouble. It is not\r\ndesirable to have all the branches emerge at the same point, either 24\r\nfrom the ground or at some lower level, as is preferable in interior\r\nsituations, but branches should be distributed up and down and around\r\nthe trunk so as to give a strong, well-balanced, low-headed tree. So far\r\nas wrapping interferes with the growth of shoots in this manner it is\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal Tar and Asphaltum on Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of coal tar or asphaltum applied to the bark of\r\ntrees?\r\n\r\nThe application of coal tar to prevent the root borers of the prune\r\nwhich operate near the surface of the ground was found to be not\r\ninjurious to the trees, although there was great apprehension that there\r\nwould be. The application of asphaltum, what is known as \"grade D,\" has\r\nbeen also used to some extent in the Santa Clara valley without injury.\r\nOf course, in the use of any black material, you increase the danger of\r\nsunburn, if applied to bark which is reached by the sun's rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitewashing Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the proper time to whitewash walnut trees to prevent sun scald?\r\nHow high up is it advisable to apply the wash?\r\n\r\nWhitewash after heavy rains are over and before the sun gets very hot;\r\nnear the coast see that it is on early in April; in the interior it\r\nshould be in place in March. Do not wait until all the rains are over,\r\nbecause there is a great chance of bark-burning between rains in the\r\nspring. Whitewash the trunk and the larger limbs - wherever the sun can\r\nreach the bark; being careful to keep the surface white where the 2\r\no'clock sun hits it. Be particular to whitewash, or otherwise protect by\r\n\"protectors\" or burlap wrappings, all young trees; the young tree is\r\nmore apt to be hurt than an old one, but bark seems never to get too old\r\nto burn if the sun is hot enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShaping a Young Tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn shortening back long, slim limbs the side shoots come out, and one\r\nsoon has a lot of ugly, crooked limbs to look at. There are a number of\r\norchards here being spoiled in that way. How is this avoided?\r\n\r\nYou cannot secure a low-heading, well-shaped tree without cutting back\r\nthe branches. Afterward you can improve the form by selecting shoots\r\nwhich are going in directions which you prefer, or you can cut back the\r\nshoots afterward to a bud which will start in the direction which you\r\ndesire. In this way the progressive shaping of the tree must be pursued.\r\nIf you only have a few trees and can afford the time, you can, of\r\ncourse, bend and tie the branches as they grow, so that they will take\r\ndirections which seem to you better, but this is not practicable in\r\norcharding on a commercial scale. There is no disadvantage in crooked\r\nbranches in a fruit tree, but they should crook in desirable directions,\r\nand that is where the art in pruning comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to prune the French prune and most other trees? In\r\nSanta Clara volley they prune as soon as leaves are off; in the\r\nmountains they prune later, say in February and March, and finish after\r\nbloom is started and of course when sap is up. Which is right?\r\n\r\nYou can prune French prunes and other deciduous trees at any time during\r\nthe winter that is most convenient to you. It does not make any\r\nparticular difference to the tree, nor does it injure the tree at all if\r\nyou should continue pruning after the bloom has started. In fact, it is\r\nbetter to make large cuts late in the winter, because they heal over\r\nmore readily at the beginning of the growing period than at the\r\nbeginning of the resting season. It is believed that early pruning may\r\ncause the tree or vine to start growth somewhat sooner and this may be\r\nundesirable in very frosty places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I make grafting wax for grafting fruit trees?\r\n\r\nThere are many \"favorite prescriptions\" for grafting wax. One which is\r\nnow being largely used in fruit tree grafting is as follows: Resin, 5\r\nlbs.; beeswax, 1 lb.; linseed oil, 1 pint; flour, 1 pint. The flour is\r\nadded slowly and stirred in after the other ingredients have been boiled\r\ntogether and the liquid becomes somewhat cooler. Some substitute\r\nlampblack for flour. This wax is warmed and applied as a liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlowing in Young Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow near can I plow to two-year-old orange trees safely?\r\n\r\nYou can plow young orange orchards as close to the trees as you can\r\napproach without injuring the bark, regulating depth so as not to\r\ndestroy main roots. Destruction of root fibers which have approached too\r\nnear the surface is not material. It is very desirable that the soil\r\naround and near the tree be as carefully worked as possible without\r\ninjury to the bark of the tree. How far that can be done by horse work\r\nand how much must be done by hand must be decided by the individual\r\njudgment of the grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrops Between Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be best to grow between fruit trees, while the trees are\r\ngrowing, and what to alternate each season, so as not to use up the soil\r\nwithout putting back into it?\r\n\r\nWhere one is bringing along a young orchard, without irrigation, it is\r\ndoubtful whether it is not better policy to give the trees all the\r\nadvantage of clean cultivation and ample moisture than to undertake\r\nintercropping. If you live on the place and wish to grow vegetables\r\nbetween the rows, the thorough cultivation to bring the vegetables along\r\nsatisfactorily would help to preserve moisture enough both for the\r\nvegetables and for the trees, but this is very different from growing a\r\nfield crop by ordinary methods of cultivation. Select a crop which will\r\nrequire summer cultivation, like corn, potatoes, squashes, and beans,\r\nand never a hay or grain crop which takes up moisture without working\r\nthe soil for the greater moisture conversation which hoed crops require.\r\nIn choice of hoed crops be governed by what you can use to advantage,\r\neither for house or the feeding of animals, or what you can grow that is\r\nsalable with least loss of moisture in the soil. The choice is governed\r\nentirely by local conditions, except that leguminous plants - peas,\r\nbeans, vetches, clovers, etc. - do take nitrogen from the atmosphere and\r\ncan thus be grown with least injury and sometimes with a positive\r\nbenefit to the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegular Bearing of Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can trees be induced to bear regularly instead of bearing\r\nexcessively on alternate years?\r\n\r\nThe most rational view is that in order to bear regularly the tree must\r\nbe prevented from overbearing by thinning of the fruit; also that the\r\nmoisture and plant-food supply must be regularly maintained, so that the\r\ntree may work along regularly and not stop bearing one year in order to\r\naccumulate vigor for a following year's crop. There is some reason to\r\nbelieve that some trees which seem to overbear every year can be\r\nprolonged in their profitable life and made to produce a moderate amount\r\nof fruit of large size and higher value by sharp thinning to prevent\r\noverbearing at any time. This is found clearly practicable in the cases\r\nof the apricot, peach, pear, apple, table grape, shipping plum, etc.,\r\nbecause the added value of larger fruits is greater than the cost of\r\nremoving the surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScions from Young Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have bought some one-year-old apple trees that are certified pedigree\r\ntrees. Would it be practical to take the tops of these trees and graft\r\non one-year seedlings and get the same results as from the trees I\r\nbought? Will they bear just as good, or is it necessary to take the\r\nscions from old bearing trees?\r\n\r\nThey will bear exactly the same fruit as the young trees will, but you\r\ncannot tell how good that will be until you get the fruit. The advantage\r\nof scions from bearing trees is that you know exactly what you will get,\r\nfor, presumably, you have seen and approved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate Pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill I do injury to my peach trees if I delay pruning until the last of\r\nFebruary, or until the sap begins to run and the buds to swell?\r\n\r\nIt will not do any particular harm to let your peach pruning go until\r\nthe buds swell or even after the leaves appear. Late pruning is not\r\ninjurious, but rather more inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvoiding Crotches in Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I avoid bad crotches in fruit trees?\r\n\r\nCrotches, which means branches of equal or nearly equal size, emerging\r\nfrom a point at a very acute angle, should be prevented by cutting out\r\none or both of them. The branching of a lateral at a larger angle does\r\nnot form a crotch and it usually buttresses itself well on the larger\r\nbranch. That is a desirable form of branching. Short distances between\r\nsuch branchings is desirable, because it makes a stronger and more\r\npermanently upright limb, capable of sustaining much weight of foliage\r\nand fruit. Build up the young tree by shortening in as it grows, so as\r\nto get such a strong framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrotch-Splitting of Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a young fig tree that is splitting at the crotches. I fear that\r\nwhen the foliage appears, with the force of the winds the limbs will\r\nsplit down entirely.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have been forcing the trees too much with water and thus\r\nsecured too much foliage and weak wood. Whenever a tree is doing that,\r\nthe limbs ought to be supported with bale rope tied to opposite limbs\r\nthrough the head, or otherwise held up, to prevent splitting. If\r\nsplitting has actually occurred, the weaker limb should be cut away and\r\nthe other staked if necessary until it gets strength and stiffens. If\r\nthe limbs are rather large they can be drawn up and a 3/16 inch carriage\r\nbolt put through to hold both in place; but this is a poor way to make a\r\nstrong tree. We should cut out all splits and do the best we could to\r\nmake a tree out of what is left. Then do not make them grow so fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrengthening Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read that some trees are propped by natural braces; that is, by\r\ninter-twining two opposite branches while the tree is young, so that in\r\ntime they grow together. What is your idea regarding the practicability\r\nof such an idea in a large commercial orchard?\r\n\r\nTwining branches for the purpose indicated is frequently commended, but\r\nit seems best for the use of ingenious people with plenty of time and\r\nnot many trees. To prune trees to carry their fruit so far as one can\r\nforesee, and to use props or other supports when a tree manifests need\r\nof a particular help which was not foreseen is the most rational way to\r\nhandle the proposition on a large commercial scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime for Pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper time for pruning pear and apricot trees?\r\n\r\nOrdinary deciduous fruit trees can be successfully pruned from the time\r\nthe leaves begin to turn yellow and fall, until the new foliage is\r\nappearing in the late winter or spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper time for planting grape vines?\r\n\r\nGrape vines are most successfully planted after the heavy rains and low\r\ntemperatures are over and before the growth starts: This will usually be\r\nwhenever the soil is in good condition, during the months of February\r\nand March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCovering Tree Wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best stuff to use on wounds and large cuts on my fruit\r\ntrees? I have used grafting wax, but it is expensive and not altogether\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAmputation wounds on trees can be more successfully treated with lead\r\nand oil paint than with grafting wax. Mixed paint containing benzine\r\nwould not be so good as pure lead and oil mixed for the purpose and then\r\ncarefully applied as to amount so as not to run. \"Asphaltum Grade D\" may\r\nalso be used in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCovering Sunburned Bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould asphaltum do to use an sunburned bark?\r\n\r\nOwing to the attraction of the heat by the black color, asphaltum would\r\nincrease the injury by absorption of more heat. Some white coating is\r\naltogether best for sunburn injuries, because it will reflect and not\r\nabsorb heat, and a durable whitewash applied as may be needed to keep\r\nthe white covering intact is undoubtedly the best treatment. Where the\r\nbark has been actually removed, white paint would be superior to\r\nwhitewash to keep the wood from checking while the wound was being\r\ncovered laterally by the growth of new bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToo Much Pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame peach trees entering the third year were pruned early in the winter\r\nvery severely. The pruner merely left the trunk and the three or four\r\nmain laterals, the latter about one foot in length. A large proportion\r\nof these trees have not sprouted as yet, though alder and better pruned\r\ntrees are all sprouted in the same vicinity. The bark is green and has\r\nconsiderable sap. Will the trees commence to grow?\r\n\r\nThe trees will sprout later, after they have developed latent buds into\r\nactive form. The pruning probably removed all the buds of recent growth.\r\nAfter starting they will make irregular growth, starting too many shoots\r\nin the wrong places, etc., and considerable effort will be necessary to\r\nget well-shaped trees by selection of shoots in the right places and\r\nthinning out those which are not desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Broken Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the root of an orange or other fruit tree is exposed or brakes by\r\nthe cultivator, what is the best way to treat that root?\r\n\r\nWhere a root is actually broken it is best to cut it off cleanly above\r\nthe break. This will induce quick healing over and the sending out of\r\nother roots. Where there is only a bruise on one side, all the frayed\r\nedges of the wound should be cleanly cut back to sound bark, which will\r\nhave a tendency to promote healing and prevent decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning in Frosty Places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a frosty section. Pruners are at work continuously\r\nfrom the time the apricots are harvested until spring arrives. From what\r\nis said in \"California Fruits?\" I judge late winter pruning would be\r\nbest far apricots and peaches. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nIn frosty places it is often desirable to prune rather late, because the\r\nlate-pruned tree usually starts later than the early pruned, and thus\r\nmay not bloom until after frost is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLow Growth on Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the little twigs an the lower parts of young fruit trees be\r\nremoved or shortened?\r\n\r\nAn important function which these small shoots and the foliage which\r\nthey will carry perform is in the thickening of the larger branches to\r\nwhich they are attached and overcoming the tendency of the tree to\r\nbecome too tall and spindling. This can be done at any time, even to the\r\npinching of young, soft shoots as they appear. It must be said, however,\r\nthat in ordinary commercial fruit growing little attention is paid to\r\nthese fine points, which are the great enjoyment of the European\r\nfruit-gardeners and are of questionable value in our standard\r\norcharding. It is, however, a great mistake to clear away all low twigs,\r\nfor such twigs bring the first fruit on young trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Tap-Roots Essential?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better to plant a nut or seed or to plant a grafted root; also is\r\nit better to allow the tap-root to remain or not in event of planting a\r\ngrafted root?\r\n\r\nIt does not matter at all whether the tree has its original tap-root or\r\nnot. All tap-roots are more or less destroyed in transplanting and the\r\nfact that not one per cent of the walnut trees now bearing crops in\r\nCalifornia consist of trees grown from the nut itself planted in place,\r\nis sufficient demonstration to us that it is perfectly practicable to\r\nproceed with transplanting the trees. It is more important that the tree\r\nshould have the right sort of soil and the right degree of moisture to\r\ngrow in than that it should retain the root from which the seedling\r\nstarted. The removal of the tap-root does not prevent the tree from\r\nsending out one or several deep running roots which will penetrate as\r\ndeeply as the soil and moisture conditions favor. This is true not only\r\nof the walnut but of other fruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransplanting Old Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I transplant fruit trees 2 to 3 inches through the butt, about one\r\nfoot from the ground? Varieties are oranges, lemons, pears, apples and\r\nEnglish walnuts nearly 4 inches through the butt. I wish to move them\r\nnearly a mile. What is the best way and what the best month to do the\r\nwork, or are trees too large to do well if moved?\r\n\r\nThe orange and lemon will do better in transplanting than the others.\r\nTake up the trees when the soil becomes warmed by the sun after the\r\ncoldest weather is over. This may be in February. Cut back the branches\r\nseverely and take up the trees with a good ball of earth, using suitable\r\nlifting tackle to handle it without breaking. Settle the earth around\r\nthe ball in the new place with water, and keep the soil amply moist but\r\nnot wet. Whitewash all bark exposed to the sun by cutting back. You can\r\nhandle the walnut the same way, but it would, however, probably get such\r\na setback that it might be better to buy a new tree two or three years\r\nold and plant that. The apples and pears we would not try to transplant,\r\nbut would rather have good new yearlings than try to coax them along.\r\nTransplanting deciduous trees should be done earlier in the winter than\r\nevergreens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDwarfing a Fruit Tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am told that by pruning the roots of a young tree after the root\r\nsystem is well started (say three years old) that as a result this will\r\nproduce a tree that is semi-dwarfed or practically a dwarfed fruit tree.\r\n\r\nYes; cutting back the roots in the winter and cutting back the new\r\ngrowth in the summer will have a dwarfing effect. The best way to get a\r\ndwarfed garden tree is to use a dwarfing root. You can get trees on such\r\nroots at the nurseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeedling Fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been growing seedlings from the pits of some extra fine peaches\r\nand plums with a view to planting them. A man near San Jose advised me\r\nthat I would get good results, but since then I have met others who say\r\nthat the fruit trees that spring from planted seeds yield only poor\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nIt is the tendency of nearly all improved fruit to revert to wild types,\r\nmore or less, when grown from the seed. The chances are, then, that\r\nnine-tenths or more of the seedlings which you grew for fruiting might\r\nbe worthless. A few might be as good as the fruit from which you took\r\nthe pits; possibly one might he better. For these reasons the growing of\r\nfruit trees from pits and seeds is only used for the purpose of getting\r\na root from which a chosen variety may be gotten by budding and\r\ngrafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did a little grafting last spring, and as it was my first attempt,\r\nabout ten per cent of the scions failed to grow. Now shall I saw the\r\nstub off lower down and try again, or bud into one of the sprouts that\r\nhave grown around the cut end? The trees are pear and cherry.\r\n\r\nYou did very well as a beginner not to lose more than one-tenth. Saw off\r\nbelow and graft again. You might have budded into one of those shoots\r\nlast July, and if you fail again, bud into the new shoots next summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFilling Holes in Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a number of trees that, on account of poor pruning and improper\r\ncare, are decaying in the center. Many of them are hollow for a foot or\r\nmore down the trunk.\r\n\r\nExcavate all the decayed wood with a chisel or gouge or whatever cutting\r\ntool may work well and fill the cavity with Portland cement in such a\r\nway as to exclude moisture. This will prolong the life and\r\nproductiveness of the trees for many years if other conditions are\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeferring Bloom of Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave any experiments ever been carried on definitely to decide what\r\ncauses early blossoming of fruit trees? For instance, have adjacent\r\ntrees of the same variety been treated definitely by putting a heavy\r\nmulch around one to hold the cold temperature late in the spring,\r\nleaving the other tree unmulched so the roots could warm up?\r\n\r\nIt has been definitely determined by the experiments of Professor\r\nWhidden of the Missouri Experiment Station that the swelling of the buds\r\nand starting of the foliage of fruit trees is due to the action of heat\r\nupon the aerial parts of the trees; that is, growth is not caused by\r\nincreasing the temperature of the ground and cannot be retarded by\r\ncooling the ground. Experiments with the use of snow and ice under trees\r\nby which the ground has been kept at a low temperature have not\r\nprevented the activity of the tree. The only way known to retard\r\nactivity is to spray the tree with whitewash so that the white color may\r\nreflect the heat and prevent the absorption of it by the bark, which is\r\nusually of a dark color and therefore suited to heat absorption.\r\nRetarding of growth is possible in this way for a period of six to ten\r\ndays, which, of course, in some cases might be of value, but the\r\nlengthened dormancy is probably too small to constitute it of general\r\nvalue. In whitewashing, to determine what advantage there is in it in\r\nretarding growth, the tree should be thoroughly sprayed with whitewash\r\nso as to cover all the wood some time before the buds swell. In fact, it\r\nis to prevent the early swelling of the buds that the whitewashing is\r\nresorted to. It is better to make the application, therefore, a little\r\ntoo early than too late. A specific date cannot be given for it that\r\nwould be right in all localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepairing Rabbit Injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour book says in Pruning young trees for the first time, about four\r\nmain branches should be left and these cut back to 10 or 12 inches. Now,\r\nwhere the rabbits have pruned back to 4 or 5 inches the very ones I\r\nwanted, what should be done? Some say, cut these back to the stem,\r\nallowing new shoots to start from the base of branches so removed.\r\n\r\nCut back to a bud near the stem, or if you do not see any, cut back near\r\nto the stem, but not near enough to remove the bark at the base of the\r\nshoot, for there are the latent buds which should give you the growth.\r\nThis should be watched, and the best shoot selected from each point to\r\nmake a strong branch, pinching back or removing the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Bark Wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is best to do with an apricot or prune tree when it has been hit\r\nwith an implement and the bark knocked off?\r\n\r\nCut around the bark wound with a sharp knife so as to remove all frayed\r\nedges. Cover the exposed wood with oil and lead paint to prevent\r\ncracking, and the wound will soon be covered with new bark from the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBridging Gopher Girdles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I make the bridge-graft or root-graft over the trunks of trees\r\ngirdled by gophers? Has this method proved successful in saving trees\r\nthree or four inches in diameter, and how is it done?\r\n\r\nThe bridging over of injury by mice by grafting has been known to be\r\nsuccessful for decades in countries where this trouble is encountered.\r\nUndoubtedly the same plan would work in the case of all bark injuries\r\nwhich can be bridged. The plan is to take good well-matured shoots which\r\nare a little longer than the injury which has to be spanned, making a\r\nsloping cut on both ends, also a cut into the healthy bark above and\r\nbelow the injury, and slip the cut ends of the cutting into the cuts in\r\nthe bark so that the ends go under the bark above and below, and the cut\r\nends are closely connected with the growing layer of the stock. If the\r\ncutting is made a little longer than the distance to be spanned, the\r\ntendency of the cutting by straightening is to hold itself in place.\r\nWhen in place, the connections should he covered with wax to prevent\r\ndrying out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil-Binding Plant for Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best to plant in an orchard on ground of a light sandy\r\nsediment which, after plowing, will move with the strong winds? I would\r\nlike to plant something that will benefit the ground. The winds are the\r\nstrongest from December to April. This is in the irrigated district and\r\nI need something that will make a sod during that period.\r\n\r\nWe would, in all the valleys, advise a fall irrigation (if the rains are\r\nlate) and the sowing of burr clover, which when started in September\r\nwill have the ground well covered by December, if you keep the moisture\r\nright to push it. Disking or plowing this under in March (or April,\r\naccording to locality) will hold the sand and afterward enrich it. You\r\ncan do this every year, but probably you will not need to seed it more\r\nthan once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBananas in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why bananas would not grow and bear in the vicinity\r\nof Merced if they had plenty of water? Or would the cool nights at\r\ncertain seasons keep them from bearing? Would they do better in the\r\nImperial valley?\r\n\r\nBananas would suffer too severely from frost to be profitable at any\r\npoint in the interior valleys of California. A plant would be killed to\r\nthe ground at least every year unless under glass or other protection.\r\nThere are a few places practically frostless where bananas can be grown\r\nin this State, but there is no promise in commercial production because\r\nthey can be so cheaply imported from the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarobs in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the carob tree (St. John's Bread) do well in the Sacramento valley,\r\nand is it a desirable tree for lining a driveway?\r\n\r\nCarobs have been grown in California for thirty years or more and they\r\nwill make a handsome driveway and give a lot of pods for the kids and\r\nthe pigs - for they are \"the husks which the swine did eat,\" and both\r\nlike them. They ought to be much more widely planted in California\r\nbecause they grow well and are good to look upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpineless Cactus Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have about two acres of high land in Fresno county that can't be\r\nirrigated. It is red adobe soil and there is hardpan in it. Which kind\r\nof fruit trees will grow and pay best? How near may the hardpan be to\r\nthe surface before I have to blast it?\r\n\r\nIt is a hard fruit proposition. Try spineless cactus, the fruits of\r\nwhich are delicious. Blasting would help if there is a moist substratum\r\nbelow the hardpan and might enable you to grow many fruits. If your land\r\nis hard and dry all the way down, blasting would not help you unless you\r\ncan get irrigation. Presumably your rainfall is too small for fruit\r\nunless you strike underflow below the hardpan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCleaning Fruit Trays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you advise for killing and removing the whitish mold that forms\r\non trays used for drying prunes? Would sunning the trays be effective,\r\nor washing in hot water, or is there some suitable fungicide?\r\n\r\nGood hot sun and dry wind will kill the mold. The spores of such a\r\ncommon mold are waiting everywhere, so that your fruit would mold anyway\r\nif conditions were right. Still, scalding the trays for cleanliness and\r\na short trip through the sulphur box for fungus-killing is commended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKilling Moss on Old Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some Bartlett pear trees that are covered with moss and mold, and\r\nthe bark is rough and checked. I have used potash (98%), 1 pound to 6\r\ngallons spray. It kills the long moss, but the green mold it does not\r\nseem to affect. The trees have been sprayed about one week. Some trees\r\nhave been sprayed with a 1 pound to 10 gallons solution by mistake.\r\nShall I spray these again with full strength, and when?\r\n\r\nYou have done enough for the moss at present. Even the weaker solution\r\nought to be strong enough to clean the bark. Wait and see how the bark\r\nlooks when the potash gets through biting; it will keep at it for some\r\ntime, taking a fresh hold probably with each new moisture supply from\r\nshower or damp air. The spray should have been shot onto the bark with\r\nconsiderable force - not simply sprinkled on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShy-Bearing Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some apple trees 10 and 12 years old that do not bear\r\nsatisfactorily, but persist in making 5 to 6 feet of new wood each year.\r\nIf not cut back this winter, will they be more likely to make fruit\r\nbuds?\r\n\r\nYes, probably. Certainly you should try it. You should also cultivate\r\nless and slow down the growth. If they then take to bearing, you can\r\nresume moderate pruning and better cultivation. This is on the\r\nassumption that your trees are in too rich or too moist a place. But you\r\nshould satisfy yourself by inquiry and observation as to whether the\r\nsame varieties do bear well in your vicinity when conditions are such\r\nthat slower growth is made. If the variety is naturally shy in bearing,\r\nor if it requires cross-pollination, the proposed repressive treatment\r\nmight not avail anything. In that case you can graft over the tree to\r\nsome variety which does bear well or graft part of the trees to another\r\nvariety for cross-pollination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Apples on Quince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow large a tree will the Yellow Bellefleur apple make if grafted or\r\nbudded on quince root at the age of 15 years? I have been trying to get\r\nsome information about dwarf fruit trees, but it is difficult to get.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the information is hard to get. The Yellow Bellefleur will not\r\ngrow upon the quince at all, or at least not for long. In growing dwarf\r\napples the Paradise stock is used, while the quince is used for dwarfing\r\nthe pear, and many varieties of pears will accept the quince root which\r\nthe apple rejects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStock for Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you recommend French seedling stock as greatly to be preferred to\r\nthat grown in this country?\r\n\r\nFrench seedling stock is generally used because it is graded and\r\nfurnished in uniform sizes; also, because it can usually be purchased\r\nfor less than seedlings can be grown under our labor conditions. Locally\r\ngrown apple seedlings are apt to be irregular in size and, as already\r\nstated, cost more than the properly graded imported stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApples and Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have recently come across a proposition to sow apple orchards in the\r\ninterior of southern California with alfalfa. The apples are said to be\r\nsuperior and the crop heavier, to say nothing of a half or two-thirds of\r\nan alfalfa crop in addition to the crop of apples. What do you know\r\nabout it? Is alfalfa being used by others in this way?\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly rational to grow alfalfa in fruit orchards if the water\r\nsupply is ample for both the trees and the intercrop and the owner will\r\nnot yield to the temptation to waterlog his trees for the sake of\r\ngetting more alfalfa. It is even more desirable in the interior than\r\nnear the coast, probably. In Arizona some growers have for a number of\r\nyears practiced growing alfalfa in orchards, cutting the alfalfa without\r\nremoving it, counting that clippings are worth more to them through\r\ntheir decay and the increase of the humus content of the soil. Even\r\nwhere this is not done, the alfalfa will add to the humus of the soil by\r\nits own wastes both from root and stem. The presence of an alfalfa cover\r\nreduces the danger of leaf and bark burning either by reflected or\r\nradiated heat from a smooth ground surface, and some trees are very much\r\nbenefited by this protection in regions of high temperature. This might\r\nbe expected to be the case with the apple, which is somewhat subject to\r\nleaf burning in our interior valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn grafting over apple and pear trees to some other variety, is it\r\nadvisable to cut off and graft the entire tree the first year where the\r\ntrees are from 7 to 15 years old, or would it be better to cut off only\r\na part of the top the first year and the rest the following year?\r\n\r\nIn the coast region it is a good practice to graft over the whole tree\r\nat one time, cutting, however, above the forks and not into the main\r\nstem below the forking. This gives many scions which seem able to take\r\ncare of the sap successfully. In the interior valleys, it is rather\r\nbetter practice to leave a branch or two, cutting them out at the\r\nfollowing winter's pruning, for probably the first year's grafts will\r\ngive you branches enough. This has the effect of preventing the drowning\r\nout of the scions from too strong sap-flow. Cutting back and regrafting\r\nof old trees should be done rather early, before the most active\r\nsap-flow begins. The later in the season the grafting is done, and the\r\nwarmer the locality, the more desirable it seems to be to leave a branch\r\nor two when grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Budding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to bud apples?\r\n\r\nApples are budded in July and August and remain dormant until the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMildew on Apple Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do young apple plants in the seed bed became mildewed? They are in a\r\nlath house.\r\n\r\nBecause too much moisture was associated with too much shade. More\r\nsunshine would have prevented mildew, and if they had enjoyed it the\r\nseedlings could have made better use of the water probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung apple trees set two years ago were cut back to 14 to 18 inches and\r\ncared for as to low branching, proper spacing, etc., but the desired\r\nbranches were allowed to make full growth to the present time. They have\r\nmode great growth and if allowed to continue will make too tall trees.\r\n\r\nWe understand that your trees have made two summers' growth since\r\npruning. We should cut back to a good lateral wherever you can find one\r\nrunning at the right direction at about three to four feet from the last\r\ncut, and shorten the lateral more or less according to the best judgment\r\nwe could form on sight of the tree. In this way you can take out the\r\nbranches which are running too high and make the framework for a lower\r\ngrowth. Do not remove the small twigs and spurs unless you have too many\r\nsuch shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Back Apples and Pears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"California Fruits\" says the \"apple does not relish cutting back, nor is\r\nit desirable to shorten in the branches.\" But when a three-year-old tree\r\ngets above 12 feet high, as many of mine are doing, what are you going\r\nto do? I cut these back same last year, but up they go again with more\r\nbranches than ever. The pears are getting too tall, also. Should not\r\nboth apple and pear trees be kept down to about ten feet?\r\n\r\nThe quotation you make refers to old bearing trees, and indicates that\r\ntheir pruning is not like that of the peach, which is continually\r\nshortened in to keep plenty of new wood low down. Of course, in securing\r\nlow and satisfactory branching on young apples, pears, etc., there must\r\nbe cutting back, and this must be continued while you are forming the\r\ntree. If you mean that these trees are to be permanently kept at ten\r\nfeet high, you should have planted trees worked on dwarfing stocks. Such\r\na height does not allow a standard tree freedom enough for thrift; as\r\nthey become older they will require from twice to thrice the altitude\r\nyou assign to them, probably. Pears can be more successfully kept down\r\nthan apples, but not to ten feet except as dwarfs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Old Apple Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow would you prune apple trees eight or nine years old that have not\r\nbeen cut back? There are a great many that have run up 20 feet high with\r\ntwelve or fifteen main limbs and very few being more than two or three\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nRemove cross branches which are interfering with others and thin out\r\nbranches which seem to be crowding each other at their attachments to\r\nthe trunk, by removing some of them at the starting point. Having\r\nremoved these carefully so as not to knock off spurs from other\r\nbranches, study the tree as it is thus somewhat opened up and see where\r\nremaining branches can be shortened to overcome the tendency to run too\r\nhigh. Do not shear off branches leaving a lot of stubs in the upper part\r\nof the tree, but always cut back a main branch to a lateral and shorten\r\nthe lateral higher up if desirable. This will keep away from having a\r\nlot of brush in the top of the tree. Study each tree by itself for\r\nsymmetry and balance of branches and proceed by judgment rather than by\r\nrules anyone can give you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop-Grafting Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I graft over a few Ben Davis apple trees 25 years old or\r\nthereabouts, but thrifty and vigorous?\r\n\r\nIt is certainly possible, by the old top-grafting method which has been\r\nused everywhere with apples for centuries. Graft during the winter. Work\r\non the limbs above the head so as to preserve the advantage of the old\r\nforking, using a cleft graft and waxing well. It is usually best to\r\ngraft over a part of the limbs and the balance a year later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the Apples Be the Same Kind?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a mixed orchard, mostly Gravensteins, and I want to graft all the\r\nother trees into a Gravenstein top if I can do so and at the same time\r\nget the early Gravenstein bloom and the fruit would be as satisfactory\r\nas though on other roots.\r\n\r\nThe new tree grown from the grafts will behave just like the tree from\r\nwhich the scions were taken if similarly thrifty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaces for Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat quality is it in the soil in the vicinity of Watsonville that makes\r\nthat country peculiarly adapted to the culture of apples? Are there not\r\nother portions of the State where apples could be produced on a\r\ncommercial basis?\r\n\r\nIt is not alone quality in the soil, but character of the climate that\r\nunderlie success in the Watsonville district. Apples can be and are\r\ngrown on a commercial scale through the coast district of Sonoma,\r\nMendocino, and Humboldt counties; also in suitable situations in the\r\ncoast counties south of Santa Cruz county. Along the coast, as far as\r\ndeep retentive soil and the cool air of the ocean extend, one may expect\r\nto get apples similar to those produced in the Watsonville district. In\r\nthe interior valleys, on suitable soils with adequate moisture, early\r\napples are profitably grown, while in the higher foothill and mountain\r\nvalleys in all parts of the State, where moisture is sufficient, late\r\nkeeping apples of high quality are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer-pruning Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill summer pruning cause apple trees to bear fruit instead of growing\r\nso much new wood?\r\n\r\nOver-growth can be repressed by summer pruning, and if done just at the\r\nright time bearing is increased and late new growth is avoided, but it\r\nis not easy to determine exactly the right time, and it has to be fixed\r\naccording to local conditions of length of growing season and growth\r\ncondition of the tree itself also. It is better for some varieties than\r\nothers, and, in fact, has to be done wisely. A summer slashing of apple\r\ntrees, simply because some one says so, is not only expensive, but may\r\ndo more harm than good. Therefore, those inclined to it, should try a\r\nfew trees at first and note results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Apple Seedlings in Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to plant apple trees for home use. I have an idea to plant apple\r\nseeds instead of trees: planting three or four seeds for each hill,\r\nright in the place where I would grow the trees, and select the best one\r\nto graft on. I will take seed of Bellefleurs, which are vigorous\r\ngrowers. What do you think? Will the seed germinate readily and when is\r\nthe right time to plant?\r\n\r\nSelect plump, well ripened seed, keep them in damp sand until the ground\r\nbegins to get warm in January or February, according to location. But\r\nsuch an undertaking will cost you vastly more in time, in labor, and\r\nwaste of land than it would to buy well-grown nursery trees budded with\r\nthe variety which you desire. Such trees would give you practically a\r\nuniform lot of trees in your orchard while planting seedlings and\r\ngrafting afterward would give you very irregular and for the most part\r\nunsatisfactory results - providing you get any seeds to grow at all in\r\nthe open ground, which is doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResistant Apple Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few apple trees which are almost dead from ravages of the woolly\r\naphis. I am going to dig them out and plant in their places other apple\r\ntrees on woolly aphis-proof root. Will it be necessary to use measures\r\nto exterminate the woolly aphis in the old roots or their places in the\r\nground before planting new trees in the places of the removed trees?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to undertake to kill aphis in the ground when you\r\nare planting apple trees on resistant roots. It will give your trees a\r\nbetter start to dig large holes, throw out the old soil, and fill in\r\nwith some new soil from another part of the land to be planted, but it\r\nhas been demonstrated that these roots are resistant, no matter if\r\nplanted in the midst of infestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApples and Cherries for a Hot Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of apple do you think would do best in a dry, hot climate?\r\nWhat do you think of the Early Richmond cherry in such a place?\r\n\r\nApples most likely to succeed in a dry situation are those which ripen\r\ntheir fruit very early. The Red Astrachan is on the whole the most\r\nsatisfactory, but there are many places which are altogether too dry and\r\nhot for any kind of apple. Whether cherries would succeed or not you can\r\nonly tell by trying. Possibly the trees would not live through the\r\nsummer if your soil becomes very dry. The most hardy cherries are the\r\nsour or pie cherries and the Early Richmond is one of this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie-back of Apple Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat causes the death of the top shoots in apple trees?\r\n\r\nNew wood is sometimes diseased by mildew, but die-back is usually due to\r\ntwo different causes: One, the accumulation of water in the soil during\r\nthe excessive rains of mid-winter; second, the occurrence of low\r\ntemperatures, including frosts, after the sap has risen. Which of these\r\ncauses operate in a certain case depends, of course, upon whether the\r\nsoil was heavy and inclined to retain standing water too long, or\r\nwhether there were such frosts at about the time when the leaves should\r\nstart. Sometimes, of course, both of these conditions worked in the same\r\nplace; sometimes one and sometimes the other, but certainly both of them\r\nare capable of causing the trouble. There seems to be no specific\r\ndisease; it is rather a matter of unfavorable conditions for growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage of Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe desire to store two or three thousand boxes of apples for three or\r\nfour months and propose to do it in this way: Make an excavation in dry\r\nearth, putting at the bottom of the excavation straw. Upon this straw\r\nplace the apples, then dry straw over the apples, and upon the top of\r\nthis two or three feet of dry earth. Will it be a good plan to pour on\r\nwater from time to time over the top of this to keep the apples and all\r\nwet, or should the apples be kept dry?\r\n\r\nPutting down loose apples in a straw-lined pit would be very expensive.\r\nIt would invite decay by bruising the fruit, and the result would\r\nprobably be a worthless mixture of rotten fruit and straw. The fruit\r\nshould be stored in boxes or shallow trays to reduce pressure and\r\npromote ventilation, and not in bins or large piles. Apples will keep\r\nfor a long time in good condition if the boxes are put in piles in the\r\nshade, covered with straw, which should be slightly moistened from time\r\nto time; but in that case there would not be such an accumulation of\r\nmoisture and there would be ventilation at all times. Apples should be\r\nkept dry, but they will shrivel and become unmarketable unless the air\r\nin which they are stored is kept reasonably moist. This is generally\r\naccomplished by making apple houses with double walls and roof to\r\nexclude heat and with an earth or concrete floor which can be sprinkled\r\nfrom time to time with a hose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Root-grafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an old apple orchard and would like to have two or three of the\r\nbest varieties positively identified, so that I can order these kinds\r\nfrom the nursery for next year's planting.\r\n\r\nOld California apple orchards have many varieties no longer propagated\r\nlargely. If you greatly desire to have a few trees of exactly the\r\nvarieties which you are now growing, you run some risk of mistake in\r\nordering by name, but if you make some root-grafts by taking a piece of\r\nthe smaller roots of the tree, which you can dig out, say about the size\r\nof a pencil, and graft scions upon them, you can secure root-grafts for\r\nplanting in nursery this year and in that way be sure to have trees of\r\nexactly the same kind. Root-grafts can be made in the winter, placed in\r\nsand which is kept moist and not wet, planted out as soon as the ground\r\nwarms up, and you will get immediate and very satisfactory growth in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Old Apple Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an old orchard containing some apple trees about 40 years\r\nold - trees well shaped but with plenty of main branches and limbs all\r\nvery long. The trees bear profusely in alternate years but the fruit is\r\nsmall. In pruning would you advise cutting out some main limbs where\r\nthere are over three or four and thus making a big wood reduction (where\r\nsunburn protection can still be guarded) or would you only shorten in\r\nthe branches and thin the fruit severely?\r\n\r\nDo not remove main branches unless they are clearly too numerous or have\r\nbeen allowed to grow to interference with each other or have become\r\nweakened or feeble in some way. In such cases the space is worth more\r\nthan the branch. If the tree has a fair framework do not disturb it in\r\norder to get down to an arbitrary limit of three or four main branches;\r\nsometimes the tree can carry more. If the tree is too thick, thin it out\r\nby removing side branches of more or less size - saving the best,\r\njudging by both vigor and position. Work through the whole top in this\r\nway until you reach the best judgment you can form of enough space and\r\nlight for good interior foliage and fruit. Apple branches should seldom\r\nbe shortened, and when this seems desirable, cut to a side branch and\r\nnot to a stub which will make a lot of weak shoots or brush in the top\r\nof the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Apple Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference of opinion here regarding the pruning of\r\nthree-year or older apple trees. Many people cut back three, four and\r\nfive-year-old trees half the season's growth; others only cut back six\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nApple trees are cut back during their early life to cause branching and\r\nto secure short distances between the larger laterals on the main\r\nbranches. This secures a lower, stronger tree. Cutting back twice or\r\nthree times should secure a good framework of this kind, and then the\r\napple should not be regularly and systematically cut back as the peach\r\nand apricot are. It is not possible to prescribe definite inches,\r\nbecause cutting back is a matter of judgment and depends upon how thick\r\nthe growth is, what its position and relation to other shoots, etc. The\r\nchief point in cutting back is to know where you wish the next laterals\r\nto come on the shortened shoot, and if you do not wish more laterals at\r\nonce; do not cut back at all. Treatment, of laterals which come of\r\nthemselves is another matter. Do not clip the ends of shoots unless\r\nlaterals are desired. If you keep clipping the ends of apple twigs, you\r\nwill get no fruit from some varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Almond on Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had good success with the peach trees which I grafted to almond last\r\nspring, getting about 95 per cent of a stand, and many of the grafts now\r\nare one and one-half inches diameter. In each of the trees I left about\r\na quarter of the branches, to keep up the growing process of the tree.\r\nThe universal practice around here in grafting is to cut the whole top\r\noff the tree at the time of grafting, but the increased growth and vigor\r\nof the grafts I have has proved to me and other growers around, that\r\nmuch better results are obtained by leaving part of the top on the tree\r\nat the time of grafting.\r\n\r\nYou did exceedingly well with your grafting. It seems a more rational\r\nway to proceed than by a total amputation, and yet ample success is\r\noften attained by grafting for a whole new top at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the main branches be shortened in a three-year-old almond tree?\r\nOf course, I intend to thin out the branches. Some growers here advise\r\nme to shorten the main branches; others say do not shorten them, as it\r\ntends to give the trees a brushy top.\r\n\r\nAlthough some growers are contending for regular shortening - in of the\r\nalmond as is practiced on the peach, it is not usual to cut back almond\r\ntrees after they have reached three years of age and have assumed good\r\nform. Of course, if cutting back is done, the shoots coming from near\r\nthe amputation must be thinned out to prevent the brushiness your\r\nadviser properly objected to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding and Grafting Almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better to bud or graft bitter almond seedlings of one year's\r\ngrowth, and, as they must be transplanted, would it be proper to do the\r\nwork this season or defer it for another year's growth?\r\n\r\nYour almond seedlings should have been budded in July or August after\r\nstarting from the nut, which would have fitted them for planting in\r\norchard the following winter as dormant buds, as they cannot stay where\r\nthey are another season. Now you can transplant to nursery rows in\r\nanother place: cut back and graft as the buds are swelling, allowing a\r\ngood single shoot to grow from below on those which do not start the\r\ngrafts into which you can bud in June, and cut back the stock to force\r\ngrowth as soon as the buds have taken. In this way you will get the\r\nwhole stock into trees for planting out next winter. Some will be large\r\nand some small, but all will come through if planted in good soil and\r\ncared for properly. Of course, you can plant out the seedlings and graft\r\nand bud in the orchard, but it will be a lot of trouble and you will get\r\nvery irregular results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Back Almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some nice thrifty two-year-old almond trees which I did not \"top\"\r\nthis spring. The limbs are from about four to seven or eight feet long.\r\nWould it not be best to \"top\" them yet?\r\n\r\nCut them back to a shoot of this year's growth, removing about a third\r\nof last year's growth, perhaps. This will give you lower and better\r\nbranching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am contemplating the planting of about five to eight acres of almonds:\r\nwhat variety is best to plant?\r\n\r\nBefore planting so many almonds, you should determine how satisfactory\r\nthe almond is in bearing in your location. Unless you can find\r\nsatisfactory demonstration of this fact, it is hazardous to plant such\r\nan acreage. On the other hand, if you find that almonds are bearing\r\nsatisfactorily, the kinds which are perhaps most satisfactory to plant\r\nare Nonpareil, Texas Prolific, Ne Plus Ultra and Drake's Seedling. The\r\nTexas Prolific and Drake's Seedling are abundant bearers and profitable\r\nbecause of the size of the crop, although the price is lower than the\r\nsoft-shelled varieties, Nonpareil and Ne Plus Ultra. These two varieties\r\nare such energetic pollinizers that they not only bear well themselves,\r\nbut force the bearing of the larger varieties mentioned. Every third row\r\nin your plantation should be either Texas Prolific or Drakes' Seedlings,\r\nwhich would give you two-thirds of the larger varieties and one-third of\r\nthe smaller. There are, of course, other soft-shelled almonds which are\r\nworth planting and are being considerably planted in localities where\r\nthey do well. This you can ascertain by inquiry among local growers and\r\nnurserymen. The planting of a good proportion of active pollinizers is\r\nthe most important point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond Pollination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy almond trees look healthy but the fruit seems to be diseased. Is it\r\nnecessary to have male and female trees, and how can one distinguish\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe almond is monoecious and has perfect blossoms, therefore, there is\r\nno such thing as male and female trees in the case of the almond, but\r\nmost of the best soft-shelled almonds are self-sterile and need\r\ncross-pollination from another variety. This is discussed elsewhere in\r\nanswer to another question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoots for the Almond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best root to have the almond grafted on, peach or bitter\r\nalmond? The soil is sandy.\r\n\r\nThe bitter almond and the hard-shelled sweet almond are both used and we\r\nare not aware that any particular advantage has been demonstrated for\r\neither of them. The almond does well on peach roots also, but the almond\r\nis a better root where the soil conditions suit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLongevity of Almond and Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is difference in life of peach and almond in California?\r\n\r\nThe almond is the longer-lived, but we have seen both assuming the\r\naspect of forest trees in abandoned pioneer places. Both are apt to live\r\nlonger than their planters, if soil and moisture conditions favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been told that almond trees raised from seed, no matter what kind\r\nof seed planted, will produce bitter almonds. Is this a fact?\r\n\r\nIt is not a fact. The majority will probably be hard-shell, sweet and\r\nbitter, but others will be soft-shell, medium-shell, paper-shell, and\r\neverything else you ever heard of in the almond line. The almond has the\r\nsportiest kind of seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Plant Almonds in Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 30 acres which I intend to plant to almonds and peaches, and I\r\nthought of planting the sprouted nuts and pits where I wanted my trees,\r\nand budding the same there in orchard form. As one or two years' use of\r\nthe land is not considered, what is your advice? My idea is to plant in\r\norchard at start so as not to disturb roots, as when grown in nursery\r\nand transplanted in orchard. Would it not progress as rapidly? Would you\r\nadvise budding peaches on almond roots; if not, why? My idea is that it\r\nwould give a longer-lived tree.\r\n\r\nWe would do nothing of the kind. If we decided it better to grow trees\r\nthan to buy them, we would grow and bud the seedlings in nursery and not\r\nin the field. Field budding is open to all kinds of injuries and growth\r\nfrom it, when saved from cultivation and all kinds of intruders, is\r\nirregular and uncertain. As for starting the roots from the nut in\r\nplate, it is largely a fanciful consideration. We count it no gain for\r\nthe walnut which makes a tap root, and still less gainful for the almond\r\nand peach, which, usually make spreading roots. To cut off a tap root\r\ndoes not prevent the tree from rooting deeply if the soil is favorable.\r\nAs to use of the land, you lose time by growing the seedlings in place.\r\nThe peach does well on the almond root if soil conditions favor the\r\nalmond. Perhaps it gives longer life to the peach, but the profitable\r\nlife of the peach tree in a proper soil does not depend on the root; it\r\ndepends upon the treatment of the top in pruning for renewal of\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond and Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith water-table at 18 feet, which root is best for almond trees? The\r\nexperience around here is that the peach root starts best. Which root is\r\nmost durable? What is the life of the peach root and of the almond?\r\n\r\nIt is not merely a question of depth to water, but of character of the\r\nsoil above the water. Neither of the roots will stand heavy soil which\r\nholds water too long, and both enjoy a free loam which drains readily\r\ndown to the water-table or bottom water. If the soil is rather sandy,\r\nletting the water down very quickly, the almond is better in getting to\r\nit than the peach. If it is finer and still well drained the peach will\r\ndo well, and the almond enjoys that also. The almond probably can be\r\ncounted on to stand coarser soil and greater drouth than the peach and\r\nunder such conditions will outlive the peach, probably, but both of them\r\nwill live twenty to thirty years or more if pruned in the head to get\r\nenough new wood and the trunk is kept from sunburn. Aside from this\r\nchoose the almond root for the almond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination of Almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have Drake's Seedling almonds. Some people have told me that I must\r\nplant some hardshell variety between them, otherwise they will not bear.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to plant hardshell almonds near Drake's Seedling\r\ntrees in order to have them bear. Some varieties of almonds will set few\r\nnuts unless they are cross-pollinated, but these are the paper-shell\r\nvarieties, as a rule - the Nonpareil, IXL and Ne Plus Ultra - and for\r\nthese the Drake's Seedling or Texas Prolific is planted as a pollenizer.\r\nThe highest-priced nut of all is the Nonpareil, and it is also a good\r\nbearer when in a good location and planted with Drake's or Texas\r\nProlific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStick-tight Almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have leased seven acres of bearing almond trees which have the\r\nappearance of being reasonably well cared for. I notice a few trees that\r\nstill have almonds on (\"stick-tights\"). What is the cause and remedy?\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of stick-tights is generally due to lack of moisture and\r\nthrifty growth, although some trees may be weak from some other cause\r\nand therefore deficient in sap-flow, which manifests itself in that way.\r\nSingle nuts may also fall into that condition of malnutrition. We know\r\nno remedy except to keep the trees in good thrift by cultivation or by\r\nthe use of irrigation if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShy-bearing Apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do my apricot trees not bring fruit? They seem healthy and are\r\nvigorous-looking trees. Five large trees have not borne 100 pounds of\r\nfruit in three years. The trees are not over six years old.\r\n\r\nYou may have a shy-bearing kind of apricot, of which there are many, or\r\nthe trees may have grown too fast to hold the fruit, or the frost or\r\nnorth wind may have blasted the bloom. Stop winter pruning, and summer\r\nprune to prevent excessive growth; reduce irrigation; try to convince\r\nthe apricot that it is not a \"green bay tree\" and see what will happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pruning apricots, if there should be a hollow center of a big branch\r\nin center of a seven-year-old tree, should it be cut out with summer\r\npruning? Should heavy growing apricots be summer pruned? Would it be all\r\nright to thin out a dense growth of wood in the prune trees in\r\nSeptember?\r\n\r\nIt is always desirable to cut below a hollow in a limb if possible.\r\nWhere, however, this would necessitate cutting below the desirable\r\nlaterals, the cavity may be filled with cement and thus rendered\r\nserviceable for some years. Summer pruning of the apricot is desirable\r\nif the growth is heavy and the tree has reached a bearing age. Thinning\r\nout of prune trees can be undertaken in the autumn, providing the tree\r\nhas practically finished its growth, as indicated by the change in the\r\ncolor and pose of the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApricot Propagation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Royal apricots be grafted into seedling apricots? Do the scions do\r\nwell? What is the best time to graft them?\r\n\r\nThe apricot is grafted readily by the ordinary cleft grafting,\r\namputating above the forks if the tree is low-headed enough to allow you\r\nto work into the limbs instead of the trunk. Grafts will take all right\r\nin the trunk by bark grafting, but working in smaller limbs makes a\r\nstronger tree. This is for old trees and the grafting is done during the\r\nwinter. Younger seedlings can be cleft or whip grafted in the stems, but\r\nit is better to bud into the young seedlings with plump buds of the\r\ncurrent year's growth, in June, and by shortening in the seedling above\r\nthe buds as soon as they have taken, get a growth on the bud in the\r\nlatter half of the same growing season. In nursery practice, trees are\r\nusually made by budding in July or August into seedlings which are then\r\ngrowing from the seed planted the previous winter. Little seedlings from\r\nunder old trees may be carefully transplanted to nursery rows in the\r\nspring and budded the same summer. Cultivated well and irrigated if\r\nnecessary, they will not suffer from this transplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewing Old Apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShall I prune back heavily a 15 to 20-year-old apricot tree which did\r\nnot mature its fruit this season, I think on account of neglect? It was\r\nvery poorly cultivated and not irrigated, consequently looks very sick.\r\n\r\nCut back all the main branches to six or eight feet from the ground,\r\nleaving on whatever small growth there may be below that height. Paint\r\nthe stubs and thin out the shoots next summer to get the right number of\r\nnew branches properly distributed. Whether you will get a good renewal\r\nof the head depends upon whether the sickness is in the root or not. Cut\r\nback just before the buds swell toward the end of the dormant season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Pruning of Apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it feasible to prune five-year-old apricot trees in August? They seem\r\nin good growth and have been irrigated three times this season, though\r\nthey have never been pruned very closely.\r\n\r\nSummer pruning would be perfectly proper and advisable. Summer pruning\r\nimmediately after the fruit is picked, has become much more general, and\r\nwinter pruning has proportionately decreased. Young trees are winter\r\npruned to promote low branching and short, stout limbs; bearing trees\r\nare summer pruned to promote fruit bearing and check wood growth - the\r\nexcess of bearing shoots being removed by thinning during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWild Cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do the Mahaleb and Mazzard cherries grow naturally? How large are\r\nthe trees, and what kind of fruit do they bear?\r\n\r\nThe Mazzards, of which there are many, and some of them wild in the\r\nEastern States, are counted inferior seedlings of the species avium, and\r\nare tall, large trees, the fruit being small and rather acrid and colors\r\nvarious. The Mahaleb is a European type with a smaller tree, fruit\r\ninferior to the Mazzards, and used as a root under soil and climatic\r\nconditions under which the Mazzard is not hardy and vigorous. Neither of\r\nthe kinds are worth considering for their fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some cherry trees that have not been pruned. They are beautiful\r\ntrees, but it a requires a 24-foot ladder to get near the top limbs. The\r\nside limbs reach from tree to tree. They had a splendid crop this year.\r\nPeople here tell me never to prune cherry trees. One man who claims\r\nconsiderable experience with fruit says prune them as soon as the crop\r\nis off.\r\n\r\nYour cherry trees should have been pruned for the first two or three\r\nyears quite severely, in order to secure better branching and strength\r\nin the main branches. If this is done, and the trees come into full\r\nbearing, very little pruning has to be done afterward, except removing\r\ndiseased, interfering or surplus branches, if there are too many. It is\r\nperfectly safe to cut back the trees which you now have as you have been\r\nadvised to do, after the leaves have fallen or after they have begun to\r\nturn yellow. The trees can be safely topped and thinned, for the cherry\r\naccepts pruning very readily. Even considerable amounts of the tops have\r\nbeen cut off at fruit-picking time from trees which have been running\r\ntoo high, so that the fruit could be secured, and this has not injured\r\nthe trees, according to our own experience and observation. Cherries can\r\nbe summer-pruned to check excessive growth and to promote fruit-bearing,\r\nbut as your trees have already begun to bear well, this treatment does\r\nnot seem to be necessary. You should do fall and winter pruning for the\r\nshape of the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining Cherry Grafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have grafted a lot of seedling cherries, leaving two or three buds on\r\neach piece of grafted wood. In planting these out, shall I put the union\r\nunder ground (they are grafted at the crown of the root) and shall I\r\nloosen the cloth a little later when they start to grow? How can I get\r\nthe head for the tree? Should I let only one shoot form, and when it is\r\nas high as I want it, cut it off as I would a tree gotten from a\r\nnursery?\r\n\r\nIf you have used waxed cloth in your grafting, it will be necessary to\r\nloosen it after the tree gets a good start. Common unwaxed cloth could\r\nbe trusted to decay soon enough, probably, but it should be looked at to\r\nsee that it is not binding. The union should not be placed much below\r\nthe ground surface, although it can be safely covered, and the future\r\nstem may look the better for it. One shoot could be allowed to grow from\r\neach graft, choosing the best ones and pinching the others so that they\r\nwill stop extension and hold leaves during the first season. These can\r\nbe cleanly removed at the first winter pruning at the time you head back\r\nthe main shoot to the proper height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestoring Cherry Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have about two acres of cherry trees in Sonoma county said to be about\r\n20 years old. They are in a very neglected condition and I am desirous\r\nof putting them in good shape for next year's crop. They are in a very\r\nlight sandy loam sail which is easily worked.\r\n\r\nCherry trees under good growing conditions and proper care are very long\r\nlived in California and bear abundant crops when thirty and more years\r\nof age. In the San Jose district and elsewhere there are orchards\r\nconsiderably older than the limit stated and are still very profitable.\r\nIf your trees have been so neglected that the branches have died back,\r\nthe trees should be pruned, of course, cutting out all dead wood and\r\nshortening weak or dying branches to a point where a good strong shoot\r\ncan be found. Then a good application of farmyard manure plowed in\r\nduring the rainy season, followed by summer cultivation for moisture\r\nretention. Although the cherry is very hardy, it is quite likely to\r\nsuffer on light soils which become too dry. On such soils as yours there\r\nis little if any danger of too much water in the winter, unless the land\r\nlies low, but the injury to the tree comes from the lack of moisture\r\nduring the summer time, and this, with your abundant rainfall, you can\r\nprobably assure by thorough summer cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewing Cherry Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have cherry trees set out diamond shape about 16 feet apart. We\r\ncannot take out every other tree and have any order, so we ask you if it\r\nwould be possible to cut the trees back and keep them pruned down to a\r\nsmaller size. The trees are about 20 years old and are dying back quite\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nIf the trees are dying for lack of summer moisture it is idle to do much\r\nfor them until you can give them irrigation right after the fruit\r\nripens. The cherry tree takes kindly to cutting back and will give good\r\nnew fruit-bearing shoots if the roots are in good condition. It is\r\ndesirable to remove surplus branches entirely rather than to cut back\r\neverything to a definite height, the branches to be removed being those\r\nwhich show disposition to die back and those which are running out too\r\nfar so as to reduce the space between the trees or to interfere with\r\nbranches from other trees. Branches which are failing above can in some\r\ncases be cut back to a strong thrifty lateral branch below.\r\nShortening-in branches high up is less desirable because it forces out\r\ntoo much new growth in the top of the tree and carries the fruit so high\r\nthat picking would be expensive. All cuts of any size should be painted\r\nto prevent the wood from checking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Cherries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have cherry trees in their third season which have been given the\r\nusual winter pruning. The trees are putting forth a great many more\r\nbranches than are required, and naturally many of the branches are\r\ngrowing across the tree. In cutting these extra branches, I am informed\r\nthat there is a way to trim them so that they will eventually form fruit\r\nspurs. I had an idea that in order to do this it would be well to cut\r\nabout one inch from the main branch. Some one has told me that this\r\nwould merely cause the little branch to sprout again.\r\n\r\nCherry shoots which are not required or desired for branch-forming can\r\nbe transferred into fruit spurs, if the tree is of bearing age, by\r\nshortening them in. Do not, however, cut at an arbitrary distance of one\r\ninch from the starting point, but rather save one or two buds at\r\nwhatever distance from the starting point these may be growing. If the\r\ntree is too young to bear, only growth shoots may appear from these\r\nbuds, but they are likely to be short and will support fruit spurs\r\nlater. This practice should not be carried to excess or you will have\r\ntoo many small shoots which will not get light enough to bear good\r\nfruit, even if fruit spurs should appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination of Black Tartarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many old Tartarian cherry trees around our district that have\r\nonly borne a few cherries in years. There are Bing, Royal Ann and Early\r\nPurple Guignes here with these, but they seldom, if ever, bloom with the\r\nTartarian at the proper time to pollinate. What varieties would cause\r\nthe trees to bear?\r\n\r\nSterility of the Black Tartarian is rather unusual. In the coast\r\nregions, Bing, Black Tartarian and Early Purple Guigne are all\r\nconsidered pollinizers for the Royal Ann. Inversely all these should be\r\npollinizers for the Black Tartarian, if that variety requires such\r\nassistance, which we have all along supposed that it did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Fig Suckers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few young fig trees are not growing from the tops, but are sending out\r\nsuckers, in some cases above and others below the point of grafting. Had\r\nI better let these suckers grow and see what comes from them or plant\r\nnew trees?\r\n\r\nGraft near the ground all those which are sending suckers from below the\r\ngraft. Suckers from above grafting point can be trained into trees by\r\nselecting the best, tying to stakes to straighten up and removing all\r\nother suckers but the one selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Gopher-proof Fig Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary that figs should be grafted in some other roots to keep\r\nthe gophers from destroying the trees? What root should I order?\r\n\r\nFigs are not grown on any other than fig roots and are generally\r\npropagated by rooted cuttings for the purpose of avoiding the expense of\r\ngrafting. The fruit must then be protected by killing the gophers rather\r\nthan by an effort to get the tree upon a gopher-proof root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination of Bartletts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould Clapp's Favorite be a good pollinizer for the Bartlett as well as\r\nthe White Doyenne?\r\n\r\nThe white Doyenne and the Clapp's Favorite usually begin to bloom three\r\nor four days later than the Bartlett, but the Bartlett period extends\r\nabout ten days into the blooming period of the others. Therefore, your\r\nquestion is to be answered in the affirmative; that is, if the Bartlett\r\nneeds pollination, it will be likley to get it from either of these\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComice Pears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you plant Comice pears instead of Bartletts, and why? What is\r\ntheir behavior as to bearing? Do they require any different treatment\r\nthan Bartletts? What roots? Do they need other varieties for\r\npollinizing?\r\n\r\nDo not plant Cornice instead of Bartletts except for those who have\r\ntested out the Cornice to their production and selling. Though\r\nsatisfactory in some places, it makes no such wide record of success as\r\nthe Bartlett and should be planted only on the basis of experience with\r\nit. Its propagation and culture are the same as other pears. It takes to\r\nthe quince all right if you want dwarf trees. We have no record of its\r\npollination needs, but as the Bartlett in California defies its Eastern\r\nreputation for self-sterility, it is likely that Cornice may also take\r\ncare of itself, for it is not handicapped by such Eastern condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Pears on Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw, the other day, some Bartlett pear grafts in Salway peach trees,\r\nand the party informed me that he had seen three-year-old grafts that\r\nhad pears last season. I would like your opinion, as I always thought\r\nthat such a union was not possible.\r\n\r\nOur opinion is like yours, and seeing some pear grafts set in peach\r\nbranches would not convince us that they would grow or bear fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPigs in the Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an orchard of Bartlett pears about fifteen years old, located on\r\nsediment land. I desire to set this to alfalfa, and to feed the alfalfa\r\nby letting hogs eat it off, thereby leaving the droppings on the land.\r\nWhat I wish to know is this: Will this crop be beneficial or injurious\r\nto the trees?\r\n\r\nAlfalfa can be successfully grown in an orchard, providing you have\r\nirrigation water so that the alfalfa shall not rob the trees of\r\nmoisture; otherwise it is a very dangerous practice. The practice of\r\nrunning animals of any kind in an orchard is to be condemned. Pigs are\r\nparticularly liable to injure trees by gnawing the bark, and we have\r\nseen fig trees barked clean as high as a pig could reach by standing on\r\nhis hind legs. Of course, if you try an experiment for your own\r\nsatisfaction, you will have to watch the pigs very carefully. It is true\r\nthat growing pasture crops in an orchard and grazing, it off is\r\ninjurious to trees, because the land lacks proper aeration, and good\r\norchard cultivation is even more necessary in this State than in humid\r\nclimates. Therefore, unless you are sure of a good water supply for\r\nirrigation, it would be altogether safer to give the whole land to the\r\ntrees and keep them cultivated well, or else dig out the trees and use\r\nthe land for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDwarf Pears Not Commercially Grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you kindly give the experience of pear growers in California who\r\nhave grown the dwarfs? If you can give me the data or refer me to\r\npersons who can give data showing that the growing of dwarf pears can be\r\nmade a commercial success the information will be of great value.\r\n\r\nThere is no commercial growing of dwarf pears in this State, except some\r\ntrees owned by the A. Block Company, Santa Clara. The late Mr. Block had\r\nan old orchard of dwarf trees, planted perhaps forty or fifty years ago,\r\nwhich he converted into an approach to a standard orchard by removing\r\nalternate rows, and the trees being otherwise treated like standards\r\nhave been satisfactorily producing pears for many years. How far these\r\ntrees are still on the dwarf roots and how far they have supplied\r\nthemselves with roots from the variety growth above, we do not know.\r\nThere is no disposition whatever to plant dwarf trees in this State\r\nexcept among a few amateurs who are making home fruit gardens. In view\r\nof the successful growth of standard trees in this State, there seem to\r\nbe no adequate reasons for recourse to dwarf trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYield in Drying Pears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the loss of weight in drying Bartlett pears?\r\n\r\nThey run from 7 to 8 lbs. of fresh pears to 1 lb. hard dried. There is\r\nquite wide variation according to condition of the fruit. Probably about\r\n7 1/2 to 1 would be as near a realizable ratio as you could get by\r\narbitrary estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPear Problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly let me know the advisability of grafting Bartlett pears onto\r\napple trees. In replanting pears in young orchard, how would it do to\r\ntake rooted pear suckers, graft the Bartlett on them, and save the cost\r\nof nursery stock? Last year my five-year-old Bartlett orchard was full\r\nof blossoms, but, though many pears became as large as white beans, the\r\nmajority of them dropped.\r\n\r\nThe pear and apple do not make a good union. The grafts may grow for a\r\nwhile, but finally fail. Do not use suckers as stocks. You can dig up\r\nsome year roots and use them as starters by making root-grafts with\r\nBartlett scions and do better than with suckers, but a good pear\r\nseedling is the proper thing either for budding or root grafting. Unless\r\nyou have some experience in such work, it will be cheaper in the end to\r\nbuy good nursery trees. The nonbearing of your young trees is probably\r\ndue to their youth and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBees and Pear Blight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I planted alfalfa between my pear trees and the trees\r\nbore a very heavy crop that year. Then blight made its appearance, and\r\nit was claimed that the bees carried the blight. I therefore plowed\r\nunder the alfalfa and destroyed what few beehives I had. If the theory\r\nthat the bees carry the blight from tree to tree is not correct, I will\r\nexperiment with alfalfa again this year.\r\n\r\nIt is true that bees carry pear blight. It is also true that you are not\r\nlikely to get many pears without bees to pollinate the blossoms. You\r\ncannot escape the carriage of the pear blight by removing tame bees,\r\nbecause wild bees are abundant in all parts of the State. The way to\r\novercome the blight is to pursue it by amputation of diseased branches\r\ncontinually, so that there may be no contamination for the bees to\r\ncarry. You are certainly warranted in continuing your alfalfa growing\r\nwithout regard to this question, using water enough to keep the alfalfa\r\ngrowing well without saturating the soil to the injury of the trees or\r\ninducing too much summer growth on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForage Under Sprayed Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it safe to use arsenical sprays in a pear orchard in which alfalfa is\r\nraised between the trees and afterward cut and fed to cattle?\r\n\r\nIt was fully demonstrated by experiment about 25 years ago that herbage\r\nunder trees sprayed with paris green at the rate of 1 pound to 160\r\ngallons of water was not injurious to animals pasturing upon it. We are\r\nnot aware that such an experiment has been made with the more recently\r\nused arsenates - which can be used with a much higher amount of arsenic\r\nto the gallon because they do not injure the foliage - to determine\r\nwhether the herbage below would be poisonous or not. Presumably not,\r\nbecause modern spraying does not admit as much loss from run-off as was\r\nthe case with old Spraying methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPears on Quince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw some time ago a report of some French experiments in grafting the\r\npear onto quince root. The report said the fruit produced was much\r\nlarger than on any other root.\r\n\r\nMost of our common pears will take readily when grafted on the quince,\r\nbut the quince transforms them into dwarfed trees. Such trees do\r\nproduce, with proper care, very fine fruit. The remark about their being\r\nbetter than on standard trees refers, however, to other climates than\r\nours, for California grows just as large pears on standard trees as can\r\npossibly be grown, while where conditions are harder the higher culture\r\nof the dwarf tree and the protection which it requires from climatic\r\nhardships, gives the dwarf tree the advantage. You can get pears on\r\nquince roots from most of our California nurseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination of Pears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary in growing the Comice pear successfully, to put some\r\nother pear near for the purpose of pollination in order to make it\r\nsuccessful? Will the ordinary Bartlett pear do for pollination?\r\n\r\nThe Comice pear blooms with the Bartlett, and would therefore presumably\r\nbe of pollinizing benefit to the Bartlett if the latter should require\r\nsuch treatment. Common experience in California, however, is that the\r\nBartlett is self-fertile and not self-sterile as it is commonly reported\r\nin Eastern publications. California practice is, then, to plant\r\nBartletts solidly without reference to preparation for pollination.\r\nTaking the matter the other way around, the Bartlett will do for\r\npollination of the Comice probably, if that should be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLye-Peeling Peaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give the formula for peeling peaches by dipping them in caustic\r\nsoda or lye.\r\n\r\nLye for peeling peaches is used at the rate of half to one pound to the\r\ngallon of water, according to the strength of the lye, which you can\r\ndetermine by the quickness with which it acts. The lye water is kept\r\nboiling, and the fruit is dipped in wire baskets, only being allowed to\r\nremain in the lye a few seconds, and is then plunged at once into fresh\r\nwater. You must be careful to keep the lye boiling hot, also either to\r\nuse running water for rinsing or change it very frequently, for you have\r\nto rely on fresh water to remove the lye, or the fruit is likely to be\r\nstained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAged Peach Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat should be done with peach trees 35 years old which are becoming\r\nunthrifty,  bearing only at the ends of the limbs, etc.?\r\n\r\nOld peach trees become bark-bound and need to be cut back to just above\r\nthe crotch for the forcing out of new branches, this being facilitated,\r\nof course, by application of manure, good cultivation of the soil, use\r\nof water during the dry season, etc. The peach is, under most\r\nconditions, not a long-lived tree, and if your trees are 35 years of\r\nage, it is probable that best results could be obtained by grubbing them\r\nout and replanting with young trees on new soil if possible. The\r\nprofitable life of the Eastern peach tree is put down at five or six\r\nyears. In California the profitable life of the peach sometimes reaches\r\ntwenty or more years, if growing under exceptionally good conditions;\r\nbut 35 years would seem to be at least on the borders of decrepitude.\r\nGrowing at the tips shows that you have not pruned annually to induce\r\nthe growth of new wood lower down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewing Peach Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best way to renew an old peach orchard? The trees are about\r\n18 years old, Muirs and Fosters, and are yielding good crops, but some\r\nof the trees show decline. Is it best to replace the old ones with new\r\ntrees or to plant a new orchard in between the old trees and cut out old\r\nones when new trees are three or four years old?\r\n\r\nIf the trees have sound bodies and are not badly injured by sunburn\r\nborers, do none of the things you mention, but would cut back for a new\r\nhead. Cutting back should be done during the latter half of the dormant\r\nperiod and thinning of shoots to proper balance a new head should be\r\ncarefully done the following winter. It is a hard job to get young trees\r\nto start among old trees and you are apt to get a mixed lot of trees\r\nwhich you will not be proud of. Cut back as suggested or rip out, plow\r\ndeeply and start anew, placing the rows midway between the old rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill He Have Peaches?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a young orchard between five and six years old, mostly of the\r\nLovell variety. I didn't have much of a crop this year. Should I have a\r\ngood crop next year?\r\n\r\nYou ought to be able to tell now how full a set of fruit buds you have.\r\nIf you do not know what the fruit buds are, ask some neighbor who knows\r\npeaches to point them out. If you have a good show of fruit buds, the\r\nquestion in California is not whether they will winter-kill or not, but\r\nwhether the leaves held late enough the preceding summer and therefore\r\nthe tree had strength enough to make good strong fruit buds. The late\r\naction of the leaves shows that the trees had enough autumn moisture.\r\nYou will soon learn to recognize the condition also from the plumpness\r\nof the wood which carries the fruit buds. If all has gone well so far,\r\nthe next point is to spray with the bordeaux mixture in November or\r\nDecember so that the new wood shall not be attacked by the peach blight\r\nor shothole fungus. This disease comes on early in the winter, sets the\r\nthe new bark to gumming and endangers the crop. Then if you have San\r\nJose scale, or if your trees showed much curl-leaf last spring, you\r\nought to spray before the blossom buds show color with the lime-sulphur\r\nwash. Supposing that you have good buds now and are willing to protect\r\nthem as suggested, your trees may be expected to come through with a\r\ngood crop if seasonal moisture conditions are right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeach Fillers in Apple Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard some talk against planting peach fillers in an apple\r\norchard. What is your opinion on the subject?\r\n\r\nThere is no objection providing the peach is profitable in the locality;\r\nand that point you must look into. The peach trees will not injure the\r\napples unless they are allowed to stand too long. In that case they\r\nwould interfere with the development of the apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Peach on Almond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I expect to get good results by grafting some kind of peach to\r\n19-year-old almond tree? If so, what kind of peach will be best? When\r\nshall I do grafting?\r\n\r\nPeaches take to the almond all right. Cut off and graft in the branches\r\nabove the main forking of the tree; leaving at least one large branch to\r\nbe grafted later or to be cut out entirely if you have peach growth\r\nenough to fill the top sufficiently. Graft in any kind of peach you find\r\nto be worth growing. Graft toward the latter part of the dormant season,\r\nsay when the buds are swelling for a new start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeaches on Apricot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a three-year-old peach orchard grafted or budded on apricot\r\nroots, and interspersed through the orchard are young apricot trees,\r\nfrom half-inch to inch and a half in diameter, which sprang from the\r\nroot, the peach bud or graft having died. I budded these over to peaches\r\nin summer, but the buds all died for some cause. What is now the best\r\ncourse to transform them into peach trees? If a graft, what form of\r\ngraft, and approximately when should it be made?\r\n\r\nYou can graft peach scions into the apricot sprouts by taking the peach\r\nscions of the varieties you desire while the tree is perfectly dormant,\r\nkeeping them in a cool place and putting in the grafts just as the buds\r\nare beginning to swell on the apricot stock. The scions can be buried in\r\nthe earth in the shade of a fence or building, selecting a place,\r\nhowever, which is moist enough and yet where the water does not gather.\r\nThe ordinary form of top grafting in stems an inch or more in diameter\r\nwill work well. The half-inch stems can be whip-grafted successfully.\r\nYou will have to wax well and see that the wax coating is kept sound\r\nuntil the growth starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReplanting After Root-knots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn digging out some old peach trees, I find now and then a tree affected\r\nwith root knot. I am burning the root, of course, but as these trees are\r\nscattered in the orchard, I wish to plant young trees in same locations,\r\nthus preserving the rows. Can new stock be safely put in the earth from\r\nwhich the old tree is removed? If treatment of the soil is essential,\r\nwhat is recommended?\r\n\r\nDig a good large hole, removing the earth, and fill with new earth from\r\nbetween the rows, and in this way healthy growth ought to be obtained,\r\nalthough there is always a disposition in some trees to put on knots.\r\nThey should be looked at from time to time and all those affecting the\r\nlarger stem should be removed and the wound painted with bordeaux\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuds in Bearing Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn budding over some old peach trees, should I cut away the branch above\r\nthe bud when the latter seems to have taken?\r\n\r\nThe sap flow to the upper part of the branch should be checked by part\r\ngirdling or by part breaking or bending the top above the bud, after the\r\nbud is seen to have set or taken. Do not remove the whole top until the\r\ngrowth on the bud has started out well or else you will \"drown it\" with\r\nexcessive sap flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollen Must Be of the Same Kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo peaches, nectarines and apricots set fruit with the pollen of one\r\nanother, and are the various peaches, nectarines and apricots\r\nself-sterile, or will most kinds set fruit with their own pollen?\r\n\r\nWe do not count upon pollination between different kinds of fruit. Most\r\nfruits are self-fertile, else we could not attain the practical results\r\nwe do, because it is only in the planting of almonds, cherries, pears\r\nand apples that any regard is paid to the association of varieties for\r\nthat cross-fertilization. Some fruits are more apt to be self-fertile in\r\nthis State than in other States where the growing conditions are not so\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeach Budding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is easier with the peach, grafting or budding?\r\n\r\nThe peach is rather a difficult tree to graft, and budding, on the other\r\nhand, is quite easy. You can bud into new shoots of this season's growth\r\nin July, and, if necessary, you can improve the slipping of the bark by\r\nirrigation a few days before budding. Buds can also be successfully\r\nplaced in June in the old bark of the peach, providing it is not too\r\nold. For this select well-matured buds from the larger shoots and use\r\nrather a larger shield than in working into new shoots. When the buds\r\nare seen to have taken, the top growth beyond it can be reduced\r\ngradually and some new growth forced on the buds the same season, if the\r\nsap flow continues as it might be expected to do on young trees well\r\ncared for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting on the Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill pears do to graft on the peach, or will plums do well on the peach?\r\nHow soon ought they to bear when grafted on the peach which is past\r\nthree years old?\r\n\r\nPears cannot be grafted on peaches. Plums generally do well on the\r\npeach, and if the grafts are taken from bearing trees, should come into\r\nfruit the second season. The peach is more difficult to graft than other\r\nfruit trees, because of the drying back of the bark. Be extra careful in\r\nthe waxing and be sure that the waxing remains good until the growth\r\nstarts out well the following summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Trees Failing to Start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome peach and almond trees set out last spring lived, but made no\r\ngrowth. Should they be replaced with new stock? If not, what may be\r\nexpected of them?\r\n\r\nIf your inactive trees have good plump dormant buds (though they may not\r\nbe large buds), they may make good growth the coming summer, if the land\r\nis good and the moisture right for free growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeach Planting in Alfalfa Sod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it advisable to plant canning peaches in April, and will I gain time\r\nin growth and development? I want to set out eight acres in Tuscans or\r\nPhillips on deep rich soil near Yuba City. I have a pumping plant and\r\ncan irrigate. The land has been in alfalfa for several years. I have in\r\nmind setting out trees without disturbing the alfalfa - until next\r\nplowing season. Do you think it advisable to use commercial fertilizer\r\non ten-year-old Muirs?\r\n\r\nPlanting the best canning peaches on good peach soil near Yuba City\r\nseems to be about the safest line of fruit investment which can be\r\nundertaken. We doubt that you can get much growth from trees planted in\r\nan old stand of alfalfa without some effort to kill out the plant which\r\nnow occupies the ground. Still, by deep digging, throwing out all the\r\nalfalfa roots and thorough hoeing during the growing season and keeping\r\nthe alfalfa mowers from sawing off the tops of them, the trees may make\r\na good start. As the alfalfa will have to be irrigated, April may not be\r\ntoo late to start the trees, providing you can find nursery stock which\r\nis still quite dormant. Probably ten-year-old peach trees will be very\r\nmuch improved by commercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrune on Almond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat root is considered best for prune trees? The ranch lies above the\r\ncreek. A friend is very partial to the almond root instead of the\r\nmyrobalan, but I understand that the prune tree sometimes outgrows the\r\nalmond root.\r\n\r\nIf you have a deep rather light soil which drains well and which there\r\nis, therefore, no danger of water standing during the rainy season, the\r\nalmond root is perfectly satisfactory for the prune. It is a\r\nstrong-growing root and keeps pace with the top growth well. The prune,\r\nin fact, is more apt to overgrow the myrobalan than the almond, and the\r\nmyrobalan will not do well on light soils likely to dry out as the\r\nalmond will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-grafting Silver Prunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have five acres of Silver prunes which produce very little fruit. The\r\ntrees are strong and healthy. French prune trees adjoining bear\r\nregularly and heavily. Can I graft French prunes on the Silver trees?\r\nWill Silver prune trees take other grafts, such as apricots or apples?\r\n\r\nThe Silver prune is often unsatisfactory for reason of shy bearing. It\r\nis perfectly feasible to graft over the tree to the French prune and\r\nthis has been done for years by different growers. Apricots will usually\r\ntake on the plum stock, but are apt to over-grow it or else be dwarfed\r\nthemselves, but the apricot is often worked upon a plum stock. Apples\r\nhave no grafting affinity whatever for the plum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench or Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prune-growing district around Salem, Oregon, Italian prunes are\r\ngrown exclusively for drying purposes. French prunes were considered\r\nworthless. Here in Sutter county, California, a great many French prunes\r\nare grown and we are advised to plant them, but would rather plant the\r\nItalian prune. Which would you advise us to set out in this part of the\r\nState?\r\n\r\nThe Italian or Fellenberg prune was grown to some extent in California\r\n40 years and abandoned; it was not so sure in bearing as the French, and\r\nit was not the type of prune which we had ambition to excel with. The\r\nprune which we grow as the French is the true prune or plum of Agen. We\r\nshould plant it and let the Oregon people have the Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyrobalan Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending two small plums which I am told are Myrobalan plum. I\r\ndesire to grow seedlings on which later to bud and graft French prunes.\r\nIf these are Myrobalan plums, will trees from them be as good as trees\r\nfrom pits that were imported?\r\n\r\nThe fruits are Myrobalan plums, and their seedlings would be suitable\r\nfor the French prune, providing the trees which bear them are strong,\r\nthrifty growing trees. There is great variation in the colors of the\r\nMyrobalan seedlings, from light yellow to dark red, and it is the\r\nsatisfactory growth of the tree rather than the character of the fruit\r\nwhich one has to bear in mind when growing seedlings from selected trees\r\ninstead of depending so largely on imported seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrying Plums and Prunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have plum trees of various kinds that are loaded with fruit. I do not\r\nknow if any are of the variety used for drying as prunes: I know nothing\r\nof the process of making or drying prunes. One man suggests that I dip\r\nthem for four or live minutes in a 3 or 4 per cent solution of lye and\r\nthen place them in the sun.\r\n\r\nDipping your plums is right providing they are very sweet, as they will\r\ndry like prunes without removing the pit. If they are plums that are\r\ncommercially used for shipping, without enough sugar to dry as prunes,\r\nthe pit must be removed. Drying in this way, you do not need to use lye,\r\nwhich is simply for the purpose of cracking the skin so that the\r\nmoisture can be more readily evaporated. There is no danger in using the\r\nnecessary amount of lye. Less is used than in making hominy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Prune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the commercial value of the Sugar prune? Is there any other\r\nearly ripening variety better than the Sugar?\r\n\r\nIt is selling very well as a cured prune, and growers in the northern\r\nbay counties especially have done so well that they are extending their\r\nplantings. It is coarser in flesh than the French and generally flatter\r\nin flavor when cooked and thus falls below the ideal of a cured prune,\r\nbut it has compensating characters, such as early ripening, with which\r\nno other prune compares. The Sugar is also valuable as a shipping plum\r\nto Eastern markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlossing Dried Prunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you give the method for giving the gloss to dried French prunes?\r\n\r\nThere are various methods. One pound of glycerine to 20 gallons of\r\nwater; a quick dip in the mixture very hot gives a good finish. Where a\r\nclear bloom rather than a shine, is desired, five pounds of common salt\r\nto 100 gallons of water, also dipped hot, gives a good effect. Some use\r\na thin syrup made by boiling small prunes in water (by stove or steam)\r\nand thinning with water to produce the result desired. Steam cooking\r\navoids bad flavor by burning. The salt dip is probably the most widely\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice of Prunes on a Size Basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain the grading in price of prunes. For instance, if the base price\r\nis, say, five and three-fourths cents, what size does this refer to, and\r\nhow is the price for other sizes calculated? Also, what is the meaning\r\nof the phrase \"four-size basis\"?\r\n\r\nPrunes, after being sold to the packer, are graded into different sizes,\r\naccording to the number required to make a pound, and paid for on that\r\nbasis. The four regular sizes are 60-70s, 70-80s, 80-90s, and 90-100s,\r\nwhich means that from 60 to 70 prunes are required to make a pound, and\r\nso on. The basis price is for prunes that weigh 80 to the pound. When\r\nthe basis price is 5 3/4 cents, 80-90s are worth 1/4 cent less than this\r\namount, or 5 1/2 cents. The next smaller size, 90-100s, are worth 1/2\r\ncent less, or 5 cents, while prunes under this size are little but skin\r\nand pit and bring much less to the grower. For each next larger size\r\nthere is a difference of 1/2 cent in favor of the grower, so that on the\r\n5 3/4-cent basis 70-80s are worth 6 cents, and 60-70s 6 1/2 cents. This\r\nadvance continues for the larger sizes, 30-40s, 40-50s, etc., but these\r\nquite often command a premium besides, which is fixed according to the\r\nsupplies available and the demand for the various sizes. The sizes for\r\nwhich no premium or penalty is generally fixed are those from 60 to 100,\r\nfour sizes, so that this basis of making contracts and sales is called\r\nthe \"four-size basis.\" The advantage that results in having this method\r\nof selling prunes can be seen by the fact that on a 5 3/4-cent basis the\r\nsmallest of the four sizes will bring but 5 cents a pound, while 30-40s\r\nwould bring, without any premium, 8 1/2 cents, and with 1 cent premium,\r\n9 1/2 cents. This size has this season brought as high as 10 and 11\r\ncents a pound. It may be noted here that no prunes are actually sold at\r\njust the basis price, as they are worth either less or more than this as\r\nthey are smaller or larger than 80 to the pound. No matter what the\r\nbasis price is, there is a difference of one-half cent between each size\r\nand the sizes nearest to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollinizing Plums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many rows of Robe de Sergeant prune trees should be alternated with\r\nthe French prune (the common dried prune of commerce) to insure perfect\r\nfertilization of the blossoms?\r\n\r\nThe French prune is self-fertile; that is, it does not require the\r\npresence of other plum species for pollination of the blossoms. It is\r\nthe Robe de Sergeant prune which is defective in pollination and which\r\nis presumably assisted by proximity to the French prune. If you wish to\r\ngrow Robe de Sergeant prunes your question of interplanting would be\r\npertinent, but if you desire only to grow French prunes you need not\r\nplant the Robe de Sergeant at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCultivating Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow deep should an olive orchard be plowed? I was told that by plowing\r\ndeep I would injure my trees, in cutting up small rootlets and fibres\r\nwhich the olive extends through the surface soil. Is this so or not?\r\n\r\nPlowing olives is like plowing other trees, the purpose being to get a\r\nworkable soil deep enough to stand five or six inches of summer\r\ncultivation, usually. If you have old trees which have never been deeply\r\nplowed, you would destroy a lot of roots by deep plowing, and you should\r\nnot start in and rip up all the land at once. You can gradually deepen\r\nthe plowing, sacrificing fewer roots at a time, without injuring the\r\ntrees if they are otherwise well circumstanced. Small rootlets and\r\nfibres in the surface soil do not count; they are quickly replaced, and\r\nif you do not destroy them, the whole surface soil, if moist enough,\r\nwill be filled with a network of roots which will subsequently make\r\ndecent working of the soil impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving Old Olive Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould there be anything gained by transplanting old olive trees 6 to 8\r\ninches in diameter over nursery stock? They would have to be shipped\r\nfrom Santa Clara to Butte county and grafted. Would they come into\r\nbearing any sooner and be as good trees? Could the large limbs be used\r\nto advantage? Would the fact that they are covered with smut cause any\r\ntrouble?\r\n\r\nOld olive trees can be successfully moved a long distance by cutting\r\nback, taking up a ball of earth, and possibly a short distance with bare\r\nroots if everything is favorable. But do not for a moment think them\r\nworth such an outlay for labor, freight and hauling which such a\r\nmovement as you mention involves. The trees on arrival would probably\r\nonly be firewood, and if they lived, the time required in getting a good\r\ngrowth and grafting, etc., would perhaps be as great as in bringing a\r\nyoung tree of the right kind to bearing, and the latter would be a\r\nbetter tree in every way. Large limbs can be split and used as cuttings,\r\nbut the tree would be growth on one side and decay on the other. Use the\r\nsmaller limbs for hard-wood cuttings and the balance for firewood. The\r\nsmut shows that the trees are covered with scale insects and might\r\nindicate that it is better to burn up the whole outfit unless you learn\r\nto fight them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarkening Pickled Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything that will make olives keep their black color when put\r\ninto lye? When I put my first picking of ripe olives in lye, a large\r\npart of them turn green, the black leaving the fruit. My formula is one\r\npound of lye to five gallons of water. Have you any better formula?\r\n\r\nBy exposing the olives to the light and air, either during the salting\r\nor immediately after, ripe olives may be given a uniformly black color.\r\nAlso, fruit which is less ripe and which shows red and green patches\r\nafter processing with lye, becomes an almost uniform dark brown color.\r\nTo do this, the olives are removed from the brine and exposed to light\r\nand air freely for one or two days. Your lye was stronger than\r\nnecessary. With ripe olives it is desirable to use salt and lye together\r\nto prevent softening, and the common prescription is two ounces of\r\npotash lye and four ounces of salt to the gallon of water after the\r\nbitterness is largely removed by using one or two treatments with two\r\nounces of lye to the gallon without the salt. It is necessary to draw\r\noff the solution, rinse well, and put on fresh solution several times\r\nduring the process to get the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeedling Olives Must Be Grafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill olive trees grown from the olive seed be the right thing to plant?\r\nWill they be true to the parent tree or will they have to be grafted?\r\n\r\nOlives which a seedling olive tree will bear will be, as a rule, very\r\ninferior and generally of the type of the wild olive. All such trees\r\nmust be grafted in order to produce any particular variety which you\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlives, Oranges and Peppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been told that olive trees easily become infested with a fungus\r\ndisease which they then impart to the orange tree. The same objection is\r\nraised to the planting of pepper trees. May this be true in some parts\r\nof the State and not in others?\r\n\r\nThe fungus of which you have heard is the \"black smut.\" It is a result,\r\nnot a cause. It grows on the honey dew exuded from scale insects and if\r\nyour trees have no scale they have no fungus. The olive trees and pepper\r\ntrees may communicate this trouble to citrus trees, or vice versa -\r\nwhichever gets it first gives it away to the other. If you will work\r\nhard enough to kill the scale wherever it appears you can have all these\r\ntrees, but, of course, it costs a lot to fight scale on big pepper\r\ntrees, and it is, therefore, wisest usually to choose an ornamental tree\r\nnot likely to accept the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Olive Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have planted olive seeds which are just sprouting now. Can these be\r\nbudded next June or July in the nursery row, or can they be\r\nbench-grafted the following winter?\r\n\r\nYour seedlings may make growth enough to spur-bud this summer. The\r\nordinary plate-bud does not take freely with the olive. Some of them may\r\ndo this; other seedlings may be slow and have to be budded in the second\r\nsummer. Watch the size and the sap flow so that the bark will lift well\r\n- which may not be at just the time that deciduous trees are budded. It\r\nmay be both earlier or later in the season. Graft evergreens like the\r\nolive in the nursery row; not by bench grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Old Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seedling olive trees, set out in 1904, which I wish to change\r\nover to the Ascolano variety. Which is the best way to do it, by budding\r\nor grafting, and what is the proper time?\r\n\r\nTwig-budding brings the sap of the stock to bear upon a young lateral or\r\ntip bud, which is much easier to start than dormant buds used either as\r\nbuds or grafts. A short twig about an inch and a half in length is taken\r\nwith some of the bark of the small branch from which it starts, and both\r\ntwig and bark at its base are put in a bark slit like an ordinary shield\r\nbud and tied closely with a waxed band, although if the sap is moving\r\nfreely it would probably do with a string or raffia tie. Put in such\r\nbuds as growth is starting in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlives from Small Cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the rooting of small soft-wood olive cuttings is it necessary to\r\ncover same with glass - say perhaps prepare a cold-frame and put stable\r\nmanure in the bottom with about eight inches of sand on top?\r\n\r\nIt ceases to be a cold-frame when you cover in manure for bottom heat;\r\nit becomes a hotbed. Varieties of olives differ greatly in the readiness\r\nwith which they start from small cuttings. Some start freely and grow\r\nwell in boxes of sand under partial shade - like a lath house or cover.\r\nSome need bottom heat in such a hotbed as you describe with a cloth\r\nover; some start well in a cold-frame with a lath cover. To get the best\r\nresults with all kinds, it is safer to use some more heat than comes\r\nfrom exposure to ordinary temperatures - either by concentration, as in\r\na covered frame, or by a mild bottom heat. If you have glass frames or\r\ngreenhouse, they are, of course, desirable, but much can be done without\r\nthat expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlives from Large Cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am about to take olive cuttings from one-half to one inch thick and 54\r\nto 20 inches long, and wish to root them in nursery rows. Please advise\r\nme if it is necessary to plant under half shade? Also, can same be\r\nplanted out right away, or should they be buried in trenches for a while\r\nbefore setting out? Would it be best to strip all leaves or branches\r\noff, or leave one on? How many buds should be left above ground?\r\n\r\nPlant in open ground in the coast district generally; in the interior a\r\nlath (or litter shade not too dense) is desirable in places where high\r\ndry heat is expected and where sprinkling under the cover may be\r\ndesirable. Plant out when the soil is right as to warmth and moisture,\r\nwhich is usually a little later than this in the central and northern\r\nparts of the State. Remove all leaves and twigs and plant about\r\nthree-quarters of the length in the soil, which should be a well-drained\r\nsandy loam. The cuttings can be taken directly from the trees and need\r\nnot be bedded. If the cuttings come some distance and get end-dried,\r\nmake a fresh cut at planting. If shriveled at all, soak a few hours in\r\nwater before planting out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimming Up Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs are shooting out too low on my olive trees. Would it be right to\r\ntrim them up while dormant this winter, or should I let them grow\r\nanother year before doing so? I think I want the first limbs to start at\r\n18 to 20 inches above the ground.\r\n\r\nTake off the lower shoots whenever your knife is sharp. Do not let them\r\ngrow another year. Theoretically, the best time to remove them is toward\r\nthe end of the dormant season, but if they are not large as compared\r\nwith the whole growth of the tree, go to it any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCanning Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the recipe for preserving olives by heat, and how long do they\r\nhave to remain in the heated state?\r\n\r\nCanning olives is a process, not a recipe, and it has to be operated\r\nwith judgment. It resembles, of course, the common process of canning\r\nother fruits and vegetables. It has been demonstrated that heating up to\r\n175° Fahrenheit is effective to keep olives in sealed containers for\r\nover two years. The heating was done in the jars in the usual canning\r\nway for several minutes after 175° was reached, to be sure the contents\r\nwere heated through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewing Olive Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have olive trees on first-class land; no pest of any kind is apparent.\r\nThe trees look healthy in every way, and average about 12 inches at the\r\nbutt and 30 feet high. They have borne fruit, but for the last three\r\nyears have not borne. I am advised to cut back to stumps, 5 or 6 feet\r\nhigh, and start new tops.\r\n\r\nUnsatisfactory olive trees may be cut back, but not to such an extent as\r\nyou mention. Thin out the branches if too thick and cut back or remove\r\nthose which interfere, but to cut back to a stump would force out a very\r\nthick mass of brush which you would have to afterward go into and thin\r\nout desperately. The branches which you decide to retain may be cut back\r\nto twelve or fifteen feet from the ground. This would have the effect of\r\ngiving you plenty of new thrifty wood, which is desirable for the\r\nfruiting of the olive, but we cannot guarantee that this treatment will\r\nmake the trees satisfactory bearers. Are you sure they are receiving\r\nwater enough? If not, give them more next summer. Also give the land a\r\ngood coat of stable manure and plow under when the land is right for the\r\nplow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Olives from Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are seedlings grown from olive seeds?\r\n\r\nGrowing olives from seeds is promoted by assisting nature to break the\r\nhard shell. This can be done by pinching carefully with ordinary wire\r\npliers until the shell cracks without injury to the kernel, or the shell\r\nmay be cut into with a file, making a very small aperture to admit\r\nmoisture. The French have specially contrived pliers with a stop which\r\nadmits cracking and prevents crushing. Olive seeds in their natural\r\ncondition germinate slowly and irregularly. They must be kept moist and\r\nplanted about an inch deep in sandy loam, covering with chaff or litter\r\nto prevent drying of the surface. Before experimenting with olive pits,\r\ncrack a few to see if they have good plump kernels. Seedling olives must\r\nbe grafted, of course, to be sure of getting the variety you want. For\r\nthis reason growth from cuttings is almost universal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeglected Olive Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a lot of olive trees which have grown up around the old stumps.\r\nThey are large trees and some of them have six or eight trunks. Should I\r\ncut away all but one trunk or let them alone? There are some of the\r\ntrees with small olives; others none.\r\n\r\nIf the olive trees which were originally planted were trained at first\r\nand still have a good trunk and tree form, the suckers which have\r\nintruded from below should be removed. If, however, the trees have been\r\nallowed to grow many branches from below, so that there is really no\r\nsingle tree remaining, make a selection of four or five of the best\r\nshoots and grow the trees in large bush form, shortening in the higher\r\ngrowth so as to bring the fruit within easier reach and reduce the cost\r\nof picking. You can also develop a single shoot into a tree as you\r\nsuggest. Of course, you must determine whether the trees as they now\r\nstand are of a variety which is worth growing. If they are all bearing\r\nvery small fruit, it would be a question whether they were worth keeping\r\nat all, because grafting on the kind of growth which you describe would\r\nbe unlikely to yield satisfactory tree forms, though you might get a\r\ngood deal of fruit from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlives from Cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two choice olive trees on my place. I am anxious to get trees\r\nfrom these old ones and do not know how to go about it. Can I grow the\r\nyoung trees by using cuttings or slips from these old trees ? If so,\r\nwhen is the proper time to select the cuttings, and how should they be\r\nplanted?\r\n\r\nTake cuttings of old wood, one-half or three-quarters of an inch in\r\ndiameter, about ten inches long, and plant them about three-quarters of\r\ntheir length in a sandy loam soil in a row so water can be run alongside\r\nas may be necessary to keep the soil moist but not too wet. Such dormant\r\ncuttings can be put in when the soil begins to warm up with the spring\r\nsunshine. They can be put in the places where you desire them to grow in\r\none or two years. Olives, like other evergreen trees, should be\r\ntransplanted in the spring when there is heat enough to induce them to\r\ntake hold at once in their new places, and not during the winter when\r\ndormant deciduous trees are best transplanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater and Frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have in mind two pieces of land well adapted to citrus culture. Both\r\nhave the same elevation, soil, climate and water conditions, except that\r\none piece is a mile of the Kaweah river, while the other is four or five\r\nmiles distant. In case of a frost, all conditions being about the same,\r\nwhich piece would you consider to be liable to suffer the more? In the\r\nheavy frost of last December, while neither sustained any great damage,\r\nthat portion of the ground nearer the river seemed to sustain the less.\r\nIs this correct in theory? The Kaweah river at this point is a\r\ngood-sized stream of rapidly flowing water.\r\n\r\nThe land near the river, conditions of elevation being similar, would be\r\nless liable to frost. There are a good many instances where the presence\r\nof a considerable body of water prevents the lowering of the temperature\r\nof the air immediately adjacent. It is so at various points along the\r\nSacramento river, and it is recognized as a general principle that\r\nbodies of water exert a warming influence upon their immediate\r\nenvironment even in regions with a hard winter. How much it may count\r\nfor must be determined by taking other conditions into the account also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThinning Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it advisable to thin fruit on young citrus trees? Our trees have been\r\nbearing about three years, but they are still small trees. The oranges\r\nand grape fruit ripen well and are large and of excellent quality, but\r\nthe trees seem overloaded.\r\n\r\nThe size of oranges on over-burdened trees can be increased by thinning,\r\njust as other fruits are enlarged, but it is not systematically\r\nundertaken as with peaches and apricots, because it is not so necessary\r\nand because it is easy to get oranges on young trees too large and to be\r\ndiscounted for over-sized coarse fruit. Removing part of the fruit from\r\nyoung trees is often done - for the good of the tree, not for the good\r\nof the fruit. It should be done after the natural drop takes place,\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWind-blown Orange Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you do for citrus trees five years old that have been badly\r\nblown out of shape?\r\n\r\nSuch trees must be trued up by pruning into the wind; that is, cutting\r\nto outside buds on the windward side and to inside buds on the lee side;\r\nalso reducing the weight by pruning away branches which have been blown\r\ntoo far to the leeward. Sometimes trees can be straightened by moving\r\npart of the soil and pulling into the wind and bracing there by a good\r\nprop on the leeward side, but that, of course, is not practicable if the\r\ntrees have attained too much size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Balled Citrus Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some orange and lemon trees which were sent me with their roots\r\nballed up with dirt and sacks. As we are still having frosts I have not\r\nwanted to set them out. Would it not be better to let them stay as they\r\nare and keep the sacks wet (they have a sack box over them) than to put\r\nthem out while the frosts last?\r\n\r\nYour citrus trees will not be injured for a time unless mold should set\r\nin from the wet sacks. Get them into the ground as soon as the soil\r\ncomes into good condition, and cover the top for a time after they are\r\nplanted to protect them against frosts. This would be better than to\r\nhold them too long in the balls, but do not plant in cold, wet soil;\r\nhold them longer as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Navel Not Thornless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lately purchased some Washington navel orange trees, and upon\r\narrival I find they have thorns upon them. I thought the Washington\r\nnavels were thornless.\r\n\r\nThe navel orange tree is not thornless. It is described as a medium\r\nthorny variety, so that the finding of thorns upon the trees would not\r\nbe in itself sufficient indication that they were not of the right\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver-size Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some orange trees in a disintegrated granite with a good many\r\nsmall pieces of rock still remaining in the soil. What I wish to know is\r\nwhether it is probably something in the soil that makes them grow too\r\nlarge, or is it probably the method of treatment? What treatment should\r\nbe adopted to guard against this excessive growth?\r\n\r\nYoung trees have a natural disposition to produce outside sizes of\r\nfruit, and this is sometimes aggravated by excessive use of fertilizers,\r\nsometimes by over-irrigation. We would cease to fertilize for a time and\r\nto regulate irrigation so that the trees will have enough to be thrifty\r\nwithout undertaking excessive growth. Such soil as you describe is\r\nsometimes very rich at the beginning in available plant food, and\r\nfertilization should be delayed until this excess has been appropriated\r\nby the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding or Grafting in Orange Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land now ready to be planted to oranges, but it is impossible for\r\nme to buy the necessary budded stock now or even later this year. Would\r\nyou advise me to plant the \"sour stock\" as it comes from the nursery and\r\nhave it budded or crown-budded later? Are there any real objections to\r\nthis method, and, if so, what are they?\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly feasible to plant sour-stock seedlings and to graft them\r\nafterward to whatever variety of oranges you desire to grow, but it is\r\nundoubtedly better to pay a pretty good price for budded trees of the\r\nkind you desire rather than incur the delay and the irregular growth of\r\nyoung trees budded or grafted in the field. There is also danger of an\r\nirregular stand from accidental injuries to new growth started in the\r\nfield without the protection which it finds in the nursery row.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow late in the fall can budding of orange trees be done - plants that\r\nare two years old - and what advantage, if any, is late budding? What\r\nshall I do with some old trees that were budded about two months ago and\r\nare still green but not sprouted yet? The budding was done on young\r\nshoots.\r\n\r\nLate budding of the orange can be done as late as the bark will slip\r\nwell; usually, however, not quite so late as this. Such buds are\r\npreferred because in the experience of most people they make stronger\r\ngrowth than those put in in the spring. Such buds are not expected to\r\ngrow until the lowest temperatures of the winter are over. The buds\r\nwhich you speak of as green but still dormant are doing just what they\r\nought to do. They will start when they get ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder-pruning of Orange Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Washington Navels have a very heavy crop on the lower limbs, as is\r\nusual. These branches are so low down that many of the oranges lie on\r\nthe ground, and it takes a good deal of time to prop them up so that\r\nthey will not touch the ground. What would be the result of pruning off\r\nthese low branches, after the fruit is off? Will the same amount of\r\nfruit be produced by the fruit growing on the limbs higher up?\r\n\r\nCertainly, raise the branches of the orange trees by removing the lowest\r\nbranches or parts of branches which reach to the ground. A little later\r\nothers will sag down and this under-pruning will have to be continuous.\r\nIt would be better to do this than to undertake any radical removal of\r\nthe lower branches. The progressive removal as becomes necessary will\r\nnot appreciably reduce the fruiting and will be in many ways desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping Citrus Trees Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy tangerines last fall shot up like lemon trees - a dozen to twenty\r\nshoots two or three feet high. The trees are eight years old and are\r\nloaded with bloom and some of the shoots have buds and bloom clear to\r\nthe top. Some shoots have no bloom. What should I do with these shoots?\r\nCut them back like lemons or let them remain?\r\n\r\nYou must shorten the shoots if you desire to have a low tree. This will\r\ncause their branching and it will be necessary, therefore, to remove\r\nsome of the shoots entirely, either now or later, in order that the tree\r\nwill not become too compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDying Back of Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a few orange and lemon trees that are starting to die. One tree\r\nhas died on the top. What kind of spray shall I use?\r\n\r\nThe dying back of a tree at the top indicates that the trouble is in the\r\nroots, and it is usually due to standing water in the soil, resulting\r\neither from excessive application of water or because the soil is too\r\nretentive to distribute an amount of water which might not be excessive\r\non a lighter soil which would allow of its freer movement. Dig down near\r\nthe tree and see if you have not a muddy subsoil. The same trouble would\r\nresult if the subsoil is too dry, and that also you can ascertain by\r\ndigging. If you find moisture ample, and yet not excessive, the injury\r\nto the root might be due to the presence of alkali, or to excessive use\r\nof fertilizers. The cause of the trouble has to be determined by local\r\nexamination and cannot be prescribed on the basis of a description of\r\nthe plant. It cannot be cured by spraying unless specific parasite is\r\nfound which can be killed by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Trees Dropping Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a few citrus fruit trees about three years old. They have made a\r\ngood growth and are between seven and eight feet high with a good shaped\r\ntop or head. I did not expect any fruit last year and did not have any.\r\nThis spring they blossomed irregularly at blooming time, but quite an\r\namount of fruit set and grew as large as marbles, some of it the size of\r\na walnut, but lately it has about all fallen off the trees.\r\n\r\nThere is always more or less dropping from fruit trees. Some years large\r\nnumbers of oranges drop. There may be many causes, and the trouble has\r\nthus far not been found preventable. When the foliage is good and the\r\ngrowth satisfactory, the young tree is certainly not in need of\r\nanything. It is rather more likely that fruit is dropped by the young\r\ntrees owing to their excessive vegetative vigor, for it is a general\r\nfact that fruit trees which are growing very fast are less certain in\r\nfruit-setting. It is, of course, possible that you have been forcing\r\nsuch action by too free use of water. You will do well to let your trees\r\ngo along so long as they appear thrifty and satisfactory, and expect\r\nbetter fruiting when they become older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrange Training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not a single leader in an orange tree more desirable than the\r\nmuch-forked tree so commonly seen! Can a single-leader tree be made from\r\nthe nursery trees which have already formed their heads, by cutting off\r\nthe heads below so that only a straight stick without any branches is\r\nleft?\r\n\r\nAn orange tree with a central leader would not be at all satisfactory if\r\nit were carried very high. Of course, a central stem can be to advantage\r\ntaken higher than it is often done, but we would not think of growing an\r\norange tree with a central stem to the apex. The laterals would droop,\r\ncrowd down upon each other badly, open the center to sunburn, and\r\nencourage also a growth of central suckers and occasion an amount of\r\npruning altogether beyond what is necessary with a properly branched\r\ntree without a central stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCuring Citron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to know a way to cure citrons at home. I have a fine tree that\r\nhas borne very fine-looking fruit for the past two years.\r\n\r\nAn outline for the preparation of candied citron is as follows: The\r\nfruit, before assuming a yellow color, and also when bright yellow, is\r\npicked and placed in barrels filled with brine, and left for at least a\r\nmonth. The brine is renewed several times, and the fruit allowed to\r\nremain in it until required for use, often for a period of four or five\r\nmonths. When the citrons are to be candied they are taken from the\r\nbarrels and boiled in fresh water to soften them. They are then cut into\r\nhalves, the seed and pulp are removed, and the fruit is again immersed\r\nin cold water, soon becoming of a greenish color. After this it is\r\nplaced in large earthen jars, covered with hot syrup, and allowed to\r\nstand about three weeks. During this time the strength of the syrup is\r\ngradually increased. The fruit is then put into boilers with\r\ncrystallized sugar dissolved in a small quantity of water, and cooked;\r\nthen allowed to cool, and boiled again until it will take up no more\r\nsugar. It is then dried and packed in wooden boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrops Between Orange Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat crop can I plant between rows of young orange trees to utilize the\r\nground as well as pay a little something?\r\n\r\nIt depends not alone upon what will grow, but upon what can be\r\nprofitably sold or used on the place, and unless sure of that, it is\r\nusually better not to undertake planting between young trees but rather\r\nto cultivate well, irrigate intelligently, and trust for the reward in a\r\nbetter growth and later productiveness of the trees. It is clear,\r\nCalifornia experience that planting between trees except to things which\r\nare demonstrated to be profitable should not be undertaken, and where\r\none does not need immediate returns is, as a rule, undesirable. The\r\ngrowth of a strip of alfalfa, if one is careful not to submerge the\r\ntrees by over-irrigation, would be the best thing one could undertake\r\nfor the purpose of improving the soil by increasing the humus content,\r\nreducing the amount of reflected heat from a clean surface, and is\r\notherwise desirable wherever moisture is available for it. You could\r\nalso grow cow peas for the good of the land if not for other profit. You\r\ncan, of course, grow small fruits and vegetables for home use if you\r\nwill cultivate well. Common field crops, with scant cultivation, will\r\ngenerally cause you to lose more from the bad condition in which they\r\nleave the soil than you can gain from the use or sale of the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNavels and Valencias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNavel trees are being budded to Valencias in southern California,\r\nbecause of the higher price received for the late-ripening Valencias.\r\nAre the orchards in central and northern California being planted in\r\nNavels, and is there any difference in soil or climate requirements of\r\nNavels and Valencias?\r\n\r\nThere is no particular difference in the soil requirements of Valencia\r\nand Navel oranges. They are both budded on the same root. The\r\ndesirability of Navel oranges in the upper citrus districts arises from\r\nthe fact that the policy of those districts at the present time is to\r\nproduce an early orange. This they could not accomplish by growing the\r\nValencia. The great advantage of the Valencia in southern California, on\r\nthe other hand, lies in the very fact that it is late and that it can be\r\nmarketed in midsummer and early autumn when there are no Navels\r\navailable from anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrange Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about planting the seed from St. Michael's oranges or of grapefruit\r\nfor a seed-bed to be budded to Valencias?\r\n\r\nGood plump St. Michael's seeds would be all right if you desire to use\r\nsweet seedling stock. Grapefruit seedlings are good and quite widely\r\nused, though the general preference is for sour-stock seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcres of Oranges to a Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn your opinion, is it possible for one man, of average strength, to\r\ntake perfect care of a twenty-acre citrus orchard? Are the services of a\r\nman who takes the entire responsibility of an orchard (citrus) worth\r\nmore than those of a common ranch hand?\r\n\r\nIt depends upon the man, upon the age of the trees, upon the kind of\r\nsoil he has to handle, upon the irrigation arrangements and upon what\r\nyou mean by \"perfect care.\" If you contract the picking and hauling of\r\nfruit, the fumigation and allow extra help when conditions require that\r\nsomething must be done quickly, whatever it may be, a man with good legs\r\nand arms, and a good head full of special knowledge to make them go, can\r\nhandle twenty acres and if he does it right you ought to pay him twice\r\nas much as an ordinary ranch hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoots for Orange Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the conditions most favorable to orange trees budded upon sour\r\nstock; also upon sweet stock and trifoliata?\r\n\r\nThe sour stock is believed to be more hardy against trying conditions of\r\nsoil moisture - both excess and deficiency, and diseases incident\r\nthereto. The sweet stock is a free growing and satisfactory stock and\r\nmost of the older orchards are upon this root, but it is held to be less\r\nresistant of soil troubles than the sour stock, and therefore\r\npropagators are now largely using the latter. The trifoliata has been\r\npromoted as more likely to induce dormancy of the top growth during cold\r\nweather, because of its own deciduous habit. It has also been advocated\r\nas likely to induce earlier maturity in the fruit and thus minister to\r\nearly marketing. The objection urged against it has been a claimed\r\ndwarfing of the tree worked upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitrus Budding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to bud some Maltese blood orange trees to pomelos and lemons.\r\nWill they make good stock for them, and, if so, is it necessary to cut\r\nbelow the original bud?\r\n\r\nIt is possible to bud as you propose, and it is not necessary to go back\r\nto the old stock. Work in above the forks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Citrus Fruits on Lemon Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be any advantage to bud the Washington Navel on grapefruit and\r\nlemon roots?\r\n\r\nThe grapefruit or pomelo is a good root for the orange, and some\r\npropagators prefer it. The lemon root is not used at present, because of\r\nits effect in causing a coarse growth of tree and fruit and because it\r\nis more subject to disease than the orange root. In fact, we grow nearly\r\nall lemons on orange roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at budding, I cut 20 buds and immediately inserted in\r\nstock of Mexican sour orange \"Amataca.\" I left bands on them for ten\r\ndays at which time about half seemed to have \"stuck,\" but after a few\r\ndays the bark curled away and the buds dried up and died. I then tried\r\nagain, but left the bands on for thirteen days and lightly tied strings\r\naround below the bud to prevent the bark from curling, and also put\r\ngrafting wax in the cut and over the bud. These appeared fresh and green\r\nat time of taking off the bands, but three weeks later I found them\r\nrotted. The grafting wax used was made of beeswax, resin, olive oil and\r\na small amount of lard to soften it. Do you think that the action of the\r\nlard on the buds would cause them to rot?\r\n\r\nConsider first whether the buds which you use are sufficiently\r\ndeveloped; that is, a sufficient amount of hardness and maturity\r\nattained by the twig from which you took these buds. Second, use a waxed\r\nband, drawing it quite tightly around the bark, above and below the bud,\r\ncovering the bud itself without too much pressure for several days, then\r\nloosening the band somewhat, but carefully replacing over all but the\r\nbud point. It is necessary to exclude the air sufficiently, but not\r\nwholly. The use of a soft fat like olive oil or lard is not desirable.\r\nIf you use oil at all for the purpose of softening, linseed oil, as used\r\nby painters, is safer because of its disposition to dry without so much\r\npenetration. Having used olive oil and lard together you had too much\r\nsoft fatty material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudding Orange Seedlings in the Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the objections or advantages of planting sour stock seedlings\r\nwhere one wishes the trees and one or two years later bud into the\r\nbranches instead of budding the young stock low on the trunk?\r\n\r\nPlanting the seedling and at some future time cutting back the branches\r\nand grafting in the head above the forks is an expensive operation and\r\nloses time in getting fruit. You will get very irregular trees and be\r\ndisappointed in the amount of re-working you will have to do. Suckers\r\nmust be always watched for; that has to be done anyway, but a sucker\r\nfrom a wild stock is worse in effects if you happen to overlook it.\r\nAvoid all such trouble by planting good clean trees budded in nursery\r\nrows. You may have to do rebudding later, if you want to change\r\nvarieties, and that is trouble enough. Do not rush at the beginning into\r\nall the difficulties there are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrapefruit and Nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeaches, pears and plums predominate in this section, but would not\r\ngrapefruit, almonds and English walnuts be just as profitable? What is\r\nyour idea about English walnuts on black walnut root?\r\n\r\nYou can expect grapefruit to succeed under conditions which favor the\r\norange. Therefore, if oranges are doing well in your district,\r\ngrapefruit might also be expected to succeed on the same soils and with\r\nthe same treatment. Planting of almonds should proceed upon a\r\ndemonstration that the immediate location is suited to almonds, because\r\nthey are very early to start and very subject to spring frost and should\r\nnot be planted unless you can find bearing trees which have demonstrated\r\ntheir acceptance of the situation by regular and profitable crops.\r\nEnglish walnuts are less subject to frosts because they start much later\r\nin the season. They need, however, deep, rich land which will be sure\r\nnot to dry out during the summer. English walnuts are a perfect success\r\nupon the California black walnut root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil and Situation for Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it absolutely essential that orange trees be planted on a southern\r\nslope, or will they thrive as well on any slope? What is the minimum\r\ndepth of soil required for orange trees? How can I tell whether the soil\r\nis good for oranges?\r\n\r\nOrange trees are grown successfully on all slopes, although in\r\nparticular localities certain exposures may be decidedly best, as must\r\nbe learned by local observation. How shallow a soil will suit orange\r\ntrees depends upon how water and fertilizer are applied; on a shallow\r\nsoil more fertilizer and more frequent use of water in smaller\r\nquantities. Any soil which has grown good grain crops may be used for\r\norange growing if the moisture supply is never too scant and any excess\r\nis currently disposed of by good drainage. There can be no arbitrary\r\nrule either for exposure, depth or texture of soils, because oranges are\r\nbeing successfully grown on medium loam to heavy clay loam, providing\r\nthe moisture supply is kept right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransplanting Orange Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you transplant trees two years old with safety to another location\r\nin same grove, same soil; etc.?\r\n\r\nYes; and you can move them a greater distance, if you like. Take up the\r\ntrees with a good ball of earth, transplanting in the spring when the\r\nground has become well warmed, just about at the time when new growth\r\nbegins to appear on the tree. The top of the tree should he cut back\r\nsomewhat and the leaves should be removed if they show a disposition to\r\nwilt. You should also whitewash or otherwise protect the bark from\r\nsunburn if the foliage should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting Young Citrus Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to have young orange trees covered or leave them\r\nuncovered during the winter months?\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to cover with burlaps or bale with cornstalks, straw or\r\nsome other coarse litter, all young trees which are being planted in\r\nuntried places; and even where old trees are safe, young trees which go\r\ninto the frost period with new growth of immature wood should be thus\r\nprotected. Do not use too much stuff nor bundle too tightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Orange on the Osage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan the Navel orange be grafted on the osage orange? I understand it is\r\ndone in Florida, and would like to know if it has been tried in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIt cannot. It has not been done in Florida nor anywhere else. The osage\r\norange is not an orange at all. The tree is not a member of the citrus\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Pollenizer for Navels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI read that the flowers of the Navel orange are entirely lacking in\r\npollen, or only poorly supplied. If this is true, what variety of orange\r\nwould you plant in a Navel grove - to supply pollen at the proper time?\r\n\r\nWe would not plant any other orange near the Navel for the sake of\r\nsupplying it with pollen. Pollen is only needed to make seeds, and by\r\nthe same process to make the fruit set, and Navels do not make seeds,\r\nexcept rarely, nor do they seem to need pollen to make the fruit set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater and Frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom how many acres could I keep off a freeze of oranges with 1000\r\ngallons per minute? The water is at 65 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water will prevent frost over as large an area as you can\r\ncover with the water, so as to thoroughly wet the surface, but the\r\npresence of water will only be effective through about four degrees of\r\ntemperature and only for a short time. If, then, the temperature should\r\nfall below 27 degrees and should remain at that point for an hour or\r\ntwo, it is doubtful if the water would save your fruit. Water is only of\r\nlimited value in the prevention of frost, and of no value at all when\r\nthe temperature falls too low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to Do with Frosted Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best plan of treatment for frosted orange trees? The crop\r\nwill be a total loss. It does not show any tendency to fall off the\r\ntrees, however. Should it be picked off, thrown on the ground and plowed\r\nunder? Should this be done right away or later?\r\n\r\nUnsound fruit should be removed as soon as its injury can be\r\nconveniently detected and worked into the soil by cultivation; never,\r\nhowever, being allowed to collect in masses, which is productive of\r\ndecay and which may be injurious to roots. If trees are injured\r\nsufficiently to lose most of their leaves, the fruit should also be\r\nremoved if it shows a disposition to hang on. This will be a\r\ncontribution to the strength of the tree and its ability to clothe\r\nitself with new foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Frosted Citrus Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I prune two-year-old orange orchard, also nursery stock buds\r\nthat are badly injured by frost; how much to prune and at what time?\r\n\r\nAs soon as you can see how far injury has gone down the branch or stem,\r\ncut below it, so that a new shoot may push out from sound wood, and heal\r\nthe cut as soon as possible. This applies to growths of all ages. In the\r\ncase of buds, if you can only save a single node you may get a bud\r\nstarted there and make a tree of that. In the case of trees, large or\r\nsmall, it is always desirable to cut above the forkings of the main\r\nbranches, if possible, and when this much of the tree remains sound, a\r\nnew tree can be formed very quickly. If the main stem is injured, bark\r\ncracked, etc., cut below the ground and put scions in the bark without\r\nsplitting the root crown; wax well or otherwise cover exposed wood to\r\nprevent checking. If this is successfully done, root-rot may be\r\nprevented and the wound covered with new bark while the strong new stems\r\nare developing above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it best to prune out orange trees by removing occasional branches so\r\nas to permit free air passage through the trees? Some are advocating\r\ndoing so; but as I remember, the trees in southern California are\r\nallowed to grow quite dense, so that we could see into the foliage but\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of judgment, with a present tendency toward a more open\r\ntree than was formerly prescribed. Trees should be more thrifty and\r\nshould bear more fruit deeper in the foliage-wall if more air and light\r\nare admitted. But this can be had without opening the tree so that free\r\nsight of its interior is possible. We believe thinning of the growth to\r\nadmit more light and air is good, but we should not intentionally cut\r\nenough to make holes in the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you advise planting of pecans in commercial orchards here? Walnuts\r\nin their proper location constitute some of California's best\r\nimprovements. After visiting some bearing paper-shell pecans here in\r\nFresno county, I believe a pecan orchard of choice variety would be more\r\ndesirable than a walnut orchard.\r\n\r\nPecans do well on moist rich land in the interior valleys where there\r\nare sharper temperature changes than in the coast valleys, except\r\nperhaps near the upper coast. Such planting as you propose seems\r\npromising on lands having moisture enough to carry the nuts to full\r\nripening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Filberts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give information about growing filberts.\r\n\r\nFilberts have been largely a disappointment in California and no product\r\nof any amount has ever been made. Good nuts have been produced in the\r\nfoothills of the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Range. Theoretically, the\r\nplaces where the wild hazel grows would best suit the filbert, and so\r\nfar this seems to be justified by the little that has actually been\r\ndone, but there is very little to say about it beyond that. It requires\r\nmuch more experience to lift the nut out of the experimental state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Bearing of Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease inform me if young walnut trees grafted on black walnut stock\r\nwill produce fruit within 18 months after being planted.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the French varieties of English walnuts have produced\r\nfruit the second summer of their growth. This does not mean, however,\r\nthat you can count upon a crop the second year. These are usually grafts\r\nin nursery rows, and one would have to wait longer, as a rule, for trees\r\nplanted out in orchards with a chance to make a freer wood growth. This\r\nis rather fortunate, because it is better to have a larger tree than to\r\nhave the growth diverted into bearing a small amount of fruit while the\r\ntree is very young. We do not know any advantage in getting nuts the\r\nsecond year except it be to see if you really have secured the variety\r\nyou desire to produce later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Walnut Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to transplant seedlings of the black walnut?\r\n\r\nTransplant during the dormant season (as shown by absence of leaves)\r\nwhen the soil is in good condition. Handle them just as you would an\r\napple tree, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Start English Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn starting English walnuts, shall we get nursery stock grafted on\r\nCalifornia black, or shall we start our black walnut seedlings in\r\nnursery plats, or plant the nuts where the tree is wanted, and graft\r\nthem at two or three years? What is the advantage, if any, of the long\r\nstock from grafting high, over the grafted root?\r\n\r\nIf we had the money to invest and were sure of the soil conditions,\r\netc., we should buy grafted trees of the variety we desired, just as we\r\nwould of any other kind of fruit. If we were shy of money and long on\r\ntime, we would start seedlings in nursery, plant out seedlings, and\r\ngraft later, because it is easier to graft when the seedling is two or\r\nthree years in place. We count the planting of nuts in place troublesome\r\nand of no compensating advantage. The chief advantage known to us of\r\ngrafting high and getting a black walnut trunk is the hardier bark of\r\nthe black walnut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am planning to plant walnuts on rather heavy soil. I have been told to\r\nput the nut six inches below the surface, but think that too deep, as\r\nsoil is rather heavy.\r\n\r\nIn a heavy soil we should not plant these nuts more than three inches\r\nbelow the surface, but should cover the surface with a mulch of rotten\r\nstraw to prevent drying out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Grafted Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould English walnut trees be pruned? I have along the roadside English\r\nwalnuts grafted on the California black, and they have grown to very\r\nlarge size and the fruit seems to be mostly on the outside of the trees.\r\n\r\nEnglish walnuts are not usually pruned much, though it is often\r\ndesirable, and of course trees can be improved by removing undesirable\r\nbranches and especially where too many branches have started from\r\ngrafts, it is desirable that some be removed. They should be cleanly\r\nsawed off and the wound covered with wax or thick paint to prevent the\r\nwood from decaying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the best time to remove large limbs from walnut trees?\r\n\r\nThis work with walnuts or other deciduous fruit trees should be done\r\nlate in the winter, about the time the buds are swelling; never mind the\r\nbleeding, it does no harm, and the healing-growth over the wound is more\r\nrapid while the sap is pushing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn cleft grafting walnuts is it necessary to use scions with only a leaf\r\nbud, or with staminate or pistillate buds?  Is cutting the pith of the\r\nscion or stock fatal to the tree?\r\n\r\nIn grafting walnuts it is usual to take shoots bearing wood buds, and\r\nnot the spurs which carry the fruit blossoms, although a part of the\r\ngraft containing also a wood bud can be used, retaining the latter.\r\nCutting into the pith of the scion or of the stock is not fatal, but it\r\nis avoided because it makes a split or wound which is very hard to heal.\r\nFor this reason it is better to cut at one side of the pith in the\r\nstock, and to cut the scion so that the slope is chiefly in the wood at\r\none side of the pith and not cutting a double wedge in a way to bring\r\nthe pith in the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Nuts on Oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 10 to 15 acres of black oak trees which I wish to graft over to\r\nchestnuts. Can grafting be done successfully?\r\n\r\nSome success has been secured in grafting the chestnut on the chestnut\r\noak, but not, so far as we have heard, on the black oak. But grafts on\r\nthe chestnut oak are not permanently thrifty and productive, though they\r\nhave been reported as growing for some time. The same is true of English\r\nwalnut grafts on some of the native oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Walnut Seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be proper to graft one-year California black walnut seedlings\r\nthat must also be transplanted?\r\n\r\nAs the seedlings must be moved, plant in orchard and graft as two or\r\nthree-year-olds, according to the size which they attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning the Walnut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper time for pruning the walnut?  Is it bad for the tree\r\nto prune during the active season? I have recently acquired a\r\nlong-neglected grove in which many large limbs will have to be removed\r\nin order to allow proper methods of cultivation to be practiced, and I\r\nam in doubt as to the wisdom of doing this during the rise of sap.\r\n\r\nThe best time to remove large limbs to secure rapid growth of bark from\r\nthe sides of the cut, is just at the time the sap is rising. There will\r\nbe some outflow of sap, but of no particular loss to the tree. As soon\r\nas the large wounds have dried sufficiently, the exposed surface should\r\nbe painted to prevent cracking of the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern or California Black Walnuts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am told that the Eastern black walnut is a more suitable root for the\r\nlow lands in California than the California black. Is this true?\r\n\r\nThere has been no demonstration that the Eastern black walnut is more\r\nsuitable to low moist lands than the California black walnut. Our\r\ngrandest California black walnut trees are situated on low moist lands.\r\nWalnut Grove is on the edge of the Sacramento river with immense trees\r\ngrowing almost on the water's edge. Walnut Creek in Contra Costa county\r\nis also named from large walnut trees on the creek bank land. We have\r\nvery few Eastern black walnut trees in California and although they do\r\nshow appreciation of moist land, they are not in any respect better than\r\nthe Californian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRipening of Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI send you two walnuts. I am in doubt if they will mature.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are well grown, the kernel fully formed in every respect.\r\nWhether they will attain perfect maturity must be determined by an\r\nobservation of the fact and cannot be theoretically predicated. Where\r\ntrees are in such an ever-growing climate as you seem to have, they must\r\napparently take a suggestion that the time has arrived for maturity from\r\nthe drying of the soil. The roots should know that it is time for them\r\nto stop working so that the foliage may yellow and the nuts mature. It\r\nis possible that stopping cultivation a little earlier in the season may\r\nbe necessary to accomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Below Dead Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some seedling English walnut trees which are two years old, but\r\nthey are not coming out in bud this year. They are about three feet\r\nhigh, and from the top down to about 10 inches of the ground the limbs\r\nare dark brown, and below that they are a nice green. I cut the top off\r\nof one of them to see what is the matter that they do not leaf out, and\r\nI found that there is a round hole right down through the center of the\r\ntree down to the green part. The hole is about three-sixteenths of an\r\ninch in diameter. The pith of the limbs has been eaten away by some kind\r\nof a worm from the inside. Would it be better to cut the tree down to\r\nthe green part, or let them alone?\r\n\r\nIt is the work of a borer. Cut down to live wood and paint over the\r\nwound or wax it. Protect the pith until the bark grows over it or you\r\nwill have decay inside. If buds do not start on the trunk, take a sucker\r\nfrom below to make a tree of. You could put a bud in the trunk, but it\r\nis not very easy to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts in Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the walnut trees be injured in any way by irrigating them at the\r\nsame time and manner as the alfalfa - that is, by flooding the land\r\nbetween the checks? Will the walnuts make as good a growth when planted\r\nin the alfalfa, and the ground cultivated two or three feet around the\r\ntree, as though the alfalfa was entirely removed? Is it advisable to\r\nplant the trees on the checks rather than between the checks?\r\n\r\nWalnut trees will do well, providing you do not irrigate the alfalfa\r\nsufficiently to waterlog the trees; providing also that you do use water\r\nenough so that the trees will not be robbed of moisture by the alfalfa.\r\nThis method of growing trees will be, of course, safer and probably more\r\nsatisfactory if your soil is deep and loamy, as it should be to get the\r\nbest results with both alfalfa and walnuts. It would be better to have\r\nthe trees stand so that the water does not come into direct contact with\r\nthe bark, although walnut trees are irrigated by surrounding them with\r\ncheck levees. Planting walnut trees in an old stand of alfalfa is harder\r\non the tree than to start alfalfa after the trees have taken hold,\r\nbecause the alfalfa roots like to hang on to their advantage. In\r\nplanting in an old field, we should plow strips, say, five feet wide and\r\nkeep it cultivated rather than to try to start the trees in pot-holes,\r\nalthough with extra care they might go that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts in the Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill walnuts grow well in the foothill country; elevation about 600\r\nfeet, soil rich, does not crack in summer and seems to have small stones\r\nin it?\r\n\r\nWalnuts will do well providing the soil or subsoil is retentive enough.\r\nIf you have water available for irrigation in case the trees should need\r\nit, they would do well, but if the soil is gravelly way down and likely\r\nto dry out deeply and you have no water available an opposite result\r\nmight be expected. It is a fact that on some of the uplands of the coast\r\nmountains there is a lack of moisture late in the season which\r\ninterferes with the success of some fruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Increase Bearing of Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a walnut orchard which does not bear enough nuts. The trees are\r\nall fine, even trees, 10 and 12 years old, and we are told that the crop\r\nwas light this year because the trees were growing so vigorously and put\r\nmost of their energy into the new wood. Is there any special fertilizer\r\nwhich will make the trees bear more and not prompt such heavy growth?\r\n\r\nIf your adviser is right that the trees are not bearing because of\r\nexcessive growth, it would be better not to apply any fertilizer during\r\nthe coming year, but allow the trees to assume more steady habit and\r\npossibly even to encourage them to do so by using less cultivation and\r\nwater. If you wish to experiment with some of the trees, give them an\r\napplication of five pounds of superphosphate and two pounds of potash to\r\neach tree, properly distributed over the land which it occupies. You\r\ncertainly should not use any form of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperature and Moisture for the English Walnut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat amount of freezing and drouth can English walnuts stand? Under what\r\nconditions is irrigation necessary?\r\n\r\nThe walnut tree will endure hard freezing, providing it comes when the\r\ntree is dormant, because they are successfully grown in some parts of\r\nthe Eastern States, though not to a large extent; but the walnut tree is\r\nsubject to injury from lighter frosts, providing they follow\r\ntemperatures which have induced activity in the tree. On the Pacific\r\nCoast the walnut is successfully grown as far north as the State of\r\nWashington, but even in California there are elevations where frosts are\r\nlikely to occur when the tree is active, and these may be destructive to\r\nits profit, although they may not injure the tree. You are not safe in\r\nplanting walnuts to any extent except in places where you can find trees\r\nbearing satisfactorily. Planting elsewhere is, of course, an\r\nenterprising experimental thing to do, but very risky as a line of\r\ninvestment. Irrigation is required if the annual rainfall, coupled with\r\nthe retentiveness of the soil and good cultivation, do not give moisture\r\nenough to carry the tree well into the autumn, maintaining activity in\r\nthe leaves some little time after the fruit is gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts from Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a reliable nursery company selling seedling Franquette walnut\r\ntrees on a positive guarantee that they will come true to type. Are\r\norchards of this kind satisfactory?\r\n\r\nWalnuts do come truer to the seed than almonds and other fruits and the\r\nFranquette has a good reputation for remembering its ancestry. Until\r\nrecently practically all the commercial walnut product of California was\r\ngrown on seedling trees. But these facts hardly justify one in trusting\r\nto seedlings in plantings now made. The way to get a walnut of the\r\nhighest type is to take a bud or graft from a tree which is bearing that\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh-grafted Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the advantage of a high-grafted walnut? I am about ready to\r\nplant 10 acres to nuts and do not know whether to purchase Franquette\r\ngrafted high on California Black or not.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of grafting English walnut high on California Black walnut\r\nconsists in securing a main trunk for the tree, which is less liable to\r\nsunburn and probably hardier otherwise than is the stem of the English\r\nwalnut, and the present disposition toward higher grafting or budding\r\nseems therefore justified and desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting and Budding the Mulberry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the most approved manner of grafting mulberry trees? Am told\r\nthat they are very difficult to successfully graft.\r\n\r\nMost propagators find the mulberry difficult by ordinary top and cleft\r\ngrafting methods. A flute or ring graft or bud does well on small\r\nseedlings - that is, removing a ring or cylinder of the bark from the\r\nstock and putting in its place a cylinder from the variety desired, cut\r\nto fit accurately. For large trees this would have to be done on young\r\nshoots forced out by cutting back the main branches, but when this is\r\ndone ordinary shield budding in these new shoots would give good\r\nresults. Cut back the trees now and bud in the new shoots in July or\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHardiness of Hybrid Berries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much cold will Phenomenal, Himalaya and Mammoth blackberries stand\r\nin winter? Is it safe to plant where the temperature goes below 32\r\ndegrees?\r\n\r\nThese berries are hardy to zero at least, for they are grown in northern\r\nparts of this coast where they get such a touch once in a while. They\r\nhave also endured low temperatures in the central continental plateau\r\nStates and eastward. Whether they can endure the lowest temperatures of\r\nthe winter-killing regions of the northern border cannot be determined\r\nin California, for we do not have the conditions for such tests. The\r\nberries are very hardy while dormant, and probably their value in colder\r\nregions would depend rather more upon their disposition to remain\r\ndormant than upon what they can endure when in that condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Himalayas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShall the old wood be cut away in pruning Himalayas?\r\n\r\nAll the old wood which has borne fruit should be cut out in the fall and\r\nnew shoots reduced to three or four from each root, and these three or\r\nfour shoots should be shortened to a length of ten or twelve feet and be\r\ntrained to a trellis or fence, or some other suitable support. Vines\r\nwhich are allowed to grow riotously as they will, are apt to be\r\ndeficient in fruit bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrawberries with Perfect Flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas Longworth Prolific an imperfect bloom? I have Longworths in bearing\r\nwhich apparently are perfect. Is there another strain of Longworth that\r\nare not self-fertilizing?\r\n\r\nThe Longworth Prolific strawberry has both staminate and pistillate\r\nelements. Possibly some other variety, because of its resemblance to\r\nLongworth and the popularity of it, may have been wrongly given its\r\nname. Most of the varieties which are largely grown in California are\r\nperfect in blossom, though some of the newer varieties need association\r\nwith pollinizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Loganberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the new shoots of Loganberry vines, which come out in the spring,\r\nbe left or cut away? If cut, will more shoots put out in the fall and be\r\nsufficient for the next year's crop?\r\n\r\nThe Loganberry shoots which are growing should be carefully trained and\r\npreserved for next year's fruiting. The old canes should be cut away at\r\nthe base after the fruit is gathered. The plant bears each year upon the\r\nwood which grew the previous summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrawberry Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould I plant strawberries in the spring or fall?\r\n\r\nWhether it is wise to plant strawberry plants in the fall depends on\r\nseveral things, such as getting the ground in the very best of\r\ncondition, abundance of water at all times, splendidly rooted plants,\r\nand cool weather (which is very rare at the time plants are to be\r\nplanted, August and September). Plants may be taken with balls of earth\r\naround the roots, and water poured in the hole that receives the plant.\r\nAfter planting, each plant should be shaded from the sun; after this the\r\nditches must be kept full of water so the moisture will rise to the\r\nsurface; this must be done till the plant starts growth. This method can\r\nonly be used in small plantings, as it is too expensive for large\r\nplantings, as is also the potted plant method where each plant is grown\r\nin a small pot and transplanted by dumping out the earth as a ball with\r\nthe plant and putting directly in the ground. From potted plants, set\r\nout in the fall, one may count on a fine crop of berries the following\r\nspring. Strawberry plants are never dormant till midwinter, and there is\r\nno plant more difficult to transplant when roots are disturbed in the\r\nhot season, which usually prevails in the interior valleys of\r\nCalifornia. To have a long-lived strawberry field and to get best\r\nresults, planting must be done in the spring, as soon as the soil can be\r\nput in best condition to receive plants. From this a fall crop can be\r\nexpected - Answer by Tribble Bros., Elk Grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackberries for Drying Only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat variety of blackberries or raspberries are the best for drying\r\npurposes? Are berries successfully dried in evaporators? This is a\r\nnatural berry country. Wild blackberries are a wonder here.\r\nTransportation facilities do not allow raising for the city market. In\r\nyour opinion, would the planting of ten acres in berries for drying be a\r\nsuccess?\r\n\r\nThe blackberries chiefly grown in California are the Lawton, Crandall\r\nand the Mammoth. The raspberry chiefly grown is the Cuthbert. There are\r\nvery few of these berries dried. It would be better to dry them in an\r\nevaporator than in the sun, but little of it is done in this State. It\r\nis doubtful whether it would pay to plant blackberries for drying only,\r\nbecause there is such a large product flow in various places where the\r\nberries are either sold fresh or sold to the cannery, and drying is only\r\ndone for the purpose of saving the crop if the prices for the other uses\r\nare not satisfactory. To grow especially for drying would give you only\r\none chance of selling to advantage, and that the poorest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting Bush Fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to set out blackberries and Loganberries?\r\n\r\nAny time after the soil is thoroughly wet down and you can get good,\r\nmature and dormant plants for transplanting. This may be as early as\r\nNovember and may continue until February or later in some places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Strawberry Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a patch of strawberries planted this spring, is it advisable to cut\r\noff runners or root some of them?\r\n\r\nIn planting strawberries in matted rows, it is usual to allow a few\r\nrunners to take root and thus fill the row. It is the judgment of plant\r\ngrowers that plants for sale should not be produced in this way, but\r\nshould be grown from plants specially kept for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrawberries in Succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any reason, in strawberry culture, when the vines are removed\r\nat the end of the fourth year, why the ground may not be thoroughly\r\nplowed and again planted to strawberries?\r\n\r\nIt is theoretically possible to grow strawberries continuously on the\r\nsame land by proper fertilization and irrigation. Practically, the\r\nobjection is that certain diseases and injurious insects may multiply in\r\nthe land, and this is the chief reason why new plantations are put on\r\nnew land and the old land used for a time for beans or some root crop,\r\nso that the soil may be cleaned and refreshed by rotation and by the\r\npossibility of deeper tillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations on Gooseberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it that gooseberries are not grown more in California? Is there\r\nany reason, climatic or other, why the gooseberry should not be as\r\nsuccessfully grown in California as elsewhere?\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons. First, the gooseberry does not like interior\r\nvalleys, although with proper protection from mildew or by growing\r\nresistant varieties, good fruit can be had in coast or mountain valleys.\r\nSecond, practically no one cares for a ripe gooseberry in a country\r\nwhere so many other fruits are grown, and the demand is for green\r\ngooseberries for pies and sauce, and that is very easily oversupplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Farming with Grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard that they are planting Muscat grapes on the dry farming\r\nplan. Will it be successful?\r\n\r\nGrapes have been grown in California on the dry farming plan ever since\r\nAmericans came 60 years ago. Grapes can be successfully grown by\r\nthorough cultivation for moisture retention, providing the rainfall is\r\nsufficient to carry the plant when it is conserved by the most thorough\r\nand frequent cultivation. Unless this rainfall is adequate, no amount of\r\ncultivation will make grape vines succeed, because even the best\r\ncultivation produces no moisture, but only conserves a part of that\r\nwhich falls from the clouds. Whether grapes will do depends, first, upon\r\nwhat the rainfall is; second, upon whether the soil is retentive; third,\r\nupon whether you cultivate in such a way as to enable the soil to\r\nexercise its maximum retentiveness. These are matters which cannot be\r\ndetermined theoretically - they require actual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Back Frosted Vine Canes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVines have been badly injured by the late frosts, especially the young\r\nvines which were out the most. Is there anything to be done with the\r\ninjured shoots now on the vines so as to help the prospects of a crop?\r\n\r\nIf shoots are only lightly frosted they should be cut off at once as low\r\nas you can detect injury. This may save the lower parts of the shoot,\r\nfrom which a later growth can be made. Frosted parts ferment and carry\r\ndestruction downward, and therefore should be disposed of as soon as\r\npossible. Where vines have run out considerably and badly frosted, the\r\nbest practice usually is to strip off the frozen shoots so as to get rid\r\nof the dormant buds at the base, which often give sterile shoots. A new\r\nbreak of canes from other buds is generally more productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDipping Thompson Seedless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the process of dipping and bleaching Thompson seedless grapes?\r\n\r\nOne recipe for dipped raisins is as follows: One quart olive oil;\r\n3/4-pound Greenbank soda and 3 quarts water are made into an emulsion,\r\nand then reduced with 10 gallons water in the dipping tank, adding more\r\nsoda to get lye-strength enough to cut the skins, and more soda has to\r\nbe added from time to time to keep up the strength. The grapes are\r\ndipped in this solution and sulphured to the proper color. This is the\r\ngeneral outline of the process. The ability to use it well can only be\r\nattained by experience and close observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zante Currant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the currant that grows in the United States in any way related to the\r\ncurrant that grows in Greece? If so, could it be cured like the currant\r\nthat comes from Greece?\r\n\r\nThe dried currants of commerce are made in Greece and in California (to\r\na slight extent) from the grape known as the grape of Corinth. They are\r\nnot made from the bush currant which is generally grown in the United\r\nStates, and the two plants are not in any way related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Vines for an Arbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I prune grape vines, viz: Tokay, Black Cornichon, Muscat,\r\nThompson Seedless, Rose of Peru, planted for a grape arbor?\r\n\r\nYou can grow all the vines you mention with high stumps reaching part\r\nway or to the top of the arbor as you desire side or top shade or both.\r\nYou can also grow them with permanent side branches on the side slats of\r\nthe arbor if you desire. Each winter pruning would consist in cutting\r\nback all the previous summer's growth to a few buds from which new canes\r\nwill grow for shade or fruiting, or you can work on the renewal system,\r\nkeeping some of these canes long for quick foliage and more fruit\r\nperhaps and cutting some of them short to grow new wood for the\r\nfollowing year's service, as they often do in growing Eastern grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning Old Vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some Muscat grape vines 30 years old. Can I chop off most of the\r\nold wood with a hatchet and thereby bring them back to proper bearing?\r\n\r\nNot with a hatchet. If the vines are worth keeping at all, they are\r\nworth careful cutting with a saw and a painting of all cuts in large old\r\nwood. If the vines have been neglected, you can saw away surplus prongs\r\nor spurs, reserving four or five of the best placed and most vigorous,\r\nand cut back the canes of last summer's growth to one, two or three\r\nbuds, according to the strength of the canes - the thicker the canes,\r\nthe more buds to be kept. It is not desirable to cut away an old vine to\r\nget a new start from the ground, unless you wish to graft. Shape the top\r\nof the vine as well as you can by saving the best of the old growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopping Grape Vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs topping grape vines desirable?\r\n\r\nTopping of vines is in all cases more or less weakening. The more\r\nfoliage that is removed, the more weakening it is. Vines, therefore,\r\nwhich are making a weak growth from any cause whatever can only be\r\ninjured by topping. If the vines are exceptionally vigorous, the\r\nweakening due to topping may be an advantage by making them more\r\nfruitful. The topping, however, must be done with discretion. Early\r\ntopping in May is much more effective and less weakening than later\r\ntopping in June. Very early topping before blossoming helps the setting\r\nof the blossoms. Topping in general increases the size of the berries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBleeding Vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill pruning grape vines when they bleed injure them?\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated not to be of any measurable injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVines and Scant Moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be well to sucker vines and take also some bearing canes off,\r\nor in a dry year will they mature properly as in other years if the\r\nground is in good condition?\r\n\r\nVines usually bear drouth-stress better than bearing fruit trees. On\r\nsoils of good depth and retentiveness, they are likely to give good\r\ncrops in a dry year with thorough cultivation; still, lightening the\r\nburden of the vines is rational. Suckering and cutting away second-crop\r\nefforts should be done. Whether you need to reduce the first crop can be\r\ntold better by the looks of the vines later in the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSulphuring for Mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two years I have not sulphured my vineyard and had no mildew. My\r\nvines seem as healthy and thrifty as any of the neighbors' that were\r\nduly sulphured. Have I lost anything by not sulphuring?\r\n\r\nCertainly not. In sections where mildew is practically sure to come,\r\nsulphur should be used regularly as a preventive without waiting for the\r\nappearance of the disease. There are, however, many locations,\r\nespecially in the interior valley, where the occurrence of mildew is\r\nrare in sufficient volume to do appreciable harm, and then sulphuring\r\nshould depend upon the weather, which favors mildew or otherwise. But be\r\nalways on the watch and have everything ready to sulphur immediately;\r\nalso learn to recognize the conditions under which appearances of mildew\r\nbecome a menace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Sugar in Canned Grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I prevent the formation of grape sugar in canned grapes?\r\n\r\nTake care that the syrup is of the same density as the juice of the\r\ngrape when the fruit and the juice are placed together in the can. The\r\ndensity of the syrup and the juice are, of course, to be obtained by the\r\nuse of the spindle, the same arrangement employed for determining when\r\nthe percentage of sugar in the grape juice is right for raisin-making or\r\nfor wine-making. Whatever the density of the juice, make the syrup the\r\nsame by the use of the right amount of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II. Vegetable Growing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia Grown Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich are the best garden seeds to use, those raised in Ohio and the\r\nEast or those raised in Washington and Oregon or those raised in this\r\nState?\r\n\r\nIt has been definitely shown by experience and experiment that is does\r\nnot matter much where the seed comes from, providing it is well grown\r\nand good of its kind. There is no such advantage in changing seed from\r\none locality to another as is commonly supposed. Besides, it is now very\r\ndifficult to tell positively where seed is grown, because California\r\nwholesale seeds are retailed in all the States you mention, and the\r\ncontents of many small packets of seeds distributed in California went\r\nfirst of all from California to the Eastern retailers, who advertise and\r\nsell them everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloth for Hotbeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould cloth do to cover a hotbox to raise lettuce, radishes, etc., for\r\nwinter use where we get a very heavy rainfall?\r\n\r\nYes, if you make the cloth waterproof for its own preservation from\r\nmildew and other agencies of decay. The following recipe for\r\nwaterproofing cloth is taken from our book on \"California Vegetables\":\r\nSoften 4 1/2 ounces of glue in 8 3/4 pints of water, cold at first; then\r\ndissolve in, say, a washboiler full (6 gallons) of warm water, with 2\r\n1/2 ounces of hard soap; put in the cloth and boil for an hour, wring\r\nand dry; then prepare a bath of a pound of alum and a pound of salt,\r\nsoak the prepared cloth in it for a couple of hours, rinse with clear\r\nwater and dry. One gallon of the glue solution will soak about ten yards\r\nof cloth. This cloth has been used in southern California for several\r\nyears without mildewing, and it will hold water by the pailful. Where\r\nthe rain is heavy and frequent, the cloth should be well supported by\r\nslats and given slope to shed water quickly. Of course, this is only a\r\nmakeshift. Glass would be more satisfactory and durable in a region of\r\nmuch cloudiness and scant sunshine; the greater illumination through\r\nglass will make for the greater health and growth of the plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil for Vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my soil bakes and hardens quickly after irrigation, but I have\r\nan acre or so of sandy soil. Would this be best for garden truck and\r\nberries?\r\n\r\nSandy, loamy soil is better than the heavy soil for vegetables and\r\nberries, if moisture is kept right, because it can be more easily\r\ncultivated and takes water without losing the friable condition which is\r\nso desirable. A heavier soil can, however, be improved by the free use\r\nof stable manure or by the addition of sand, or by the use of one or\r\nmore applications of lime at the rate of 500 pounds to the acre, as may\r\nbe required - all these operations making the soil more loamy and more\r\neasily handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetables in a Cold, Dark Draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat vegetables will thrive in localities where the sun shines only part\r\nof the day? I have a space in my garden that gets the sun only between\r\nthe hours of 11 and 5, thereabouts; I would like to utilise those places\r\nfor vegetables if any particular kind will grow under such conditions.\r\nThe soil apparently is good, of a sandy nature, with some loam. The\r\nplace is high and subject to much wind.\r\n\r\nYou can only definitely determine by actual trial what vegetables will\r\nbe satisfactory under the shade conditions which you describe. You may\r\nget good results from lettuces, radishes, beets, peas, top onions, and\r\nmany other things which do well at rather a low temperature, while\r\ntomatoes, peppers, eggplant, etc., would probably be worthless. Your\r\nsoil is probably satisfactory and you can easily keep the moisture right\r\nby being careful not to use as much water as you would in open sunshine.\r\nThe behavior of the plants will be directly dependent upon the\r\ntemperature and the sunshine which they receive under the conditions\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJesusalem Artichokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time for planting Jerusalem artichokes?\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichoke tubers are planted in the spring after the ground\r\nhas become warm and the heavy frosts are over. The planting may be done\r\nin rows far enough apart for cultivation, the tubers being set about a\r\nfoot apart in the row. This tuber grows like a potato, but is more\r\ndelicate than the potato. It is inclined to decay when out of the\r\nground, but will not start growth as early as the potato, and therefore\r\nit is not desirable to start it early in the winter if the winters are\r\ncold and the ground apt to be very wet. Do not cut the tubers for seed\r\nas you would potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobe Artichokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land that will grow magnificent artichokes. Two plants last year\r\n(variety unknown) produced heavy crops of buds, but the scales opened\r\ntoo wide and allowed the center to become fibrous and were unsalable. Is\r\nthis due to climate, lack of sufficient water, or to not having the\r\nright variety?\r\n\r\nMany artichokes which are planted should really be put in the ornamental\r\nclass - they are either a reversion from a wilder type in plants grown\r\nfrom the seed or they never have been good. In order to determine which\r\nvarieties you had better grow on a large scale, it is desirable to get a\r\nfew plants of the different varieties as offered by seedmen. In this way\r\nyou would find out just what are considered best in different parts of\r\nthe State, and propagate largely the ones which are best worth to you.\r\nBy subdivision of the roots you get exactly the same type in any\r\nquantity you desire - ruling out undesirable variations likely to appear\r\nin seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtichoke Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Globe artichoke a profitable crop to raise commercially? Near\r\nPescadero a company has been formed to raise it for Eastern shipment. Is\r\nit a very profitable crop to raise? Are certain varieties worthless?\r\n\r\nConsiderable quantities of Globe artichokes are grown in southern and\r\ncentral California for Eastern shipment. There is a limit to the amount\r\nwhich can be profitably shipped, because people generally, at the East,\r\ndo not know the Globe artichoke and how to eat it, but more of them are\r\nlearning the desirability of it every year. There are species which are\r\nonly ornamental, as a bad weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsparagus Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the average commercial yield of asparagus to the acre in\r\nCalifornia? Also, how long it takes asparagus to come into full bearing,\r\nand what yield could be expected after two years' growth? Is asparagus\r\nresistant to moderate quantities of alkali in the soil?\r\n\r\nThe yield of asparagus is from one to four tons of marketable shoots per\r\nacre, according to age and thrift of plants, etc., the largest yields\r\nbeing on the peat lands of the river islands. On suitable lands one\r\nought to get at least two tons per acre. Roots may yield a few days'\r\ncuttings during their second year in permanent place; the third year\r\nthey will stand much more cutting, and for several years after that will\r\nbe in full yielding. Asparagus enjoys a little salt in the land, but one\r\nwould not select what is ordinarily called \"alkali land\" for growing it\r\n- not only because of the alkali but because of the soil character which\r\nit induces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBean Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a small field of beans, and would like to know which is the best\r\nand most profitable way to crop them.\r\n\r\nCultivate the beans so that the plants may have plenty of moisture to\r\nfill the pods, then let them dry and die. Gather the dry plants before\r\nthe pods open much, and let them dry on a clean, smooth piece of ground\r\nor on the barn floor. When they are well dried, thresh with a flail,\r\nrake off the straw, sweep up the beans and clean by winnowing in the\r\nwind or with a fanning mill with suitable screens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHoeing Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould beans be hoed while the dew is on the vine?\r\n\r\nBeans had better be hoed with the dew on them than not hoed at all. The\r\nonly objection to hoeing with the dew on is that the hoer will get his\r\nfeet wet, the vines will become untidy from adhering dust, with a\r\npossible chance of the leaves becoming less effective and the\r\npollination of the blossom rendered less liable to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeans as Nitrogen Gatherers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI grow string beans in my rotation to restore nitrogen, but I see it\r\nstated that not all beans are valuable for this purpose. Are the common\r\nbush varieties nitrogen gatherers?\r\n\r\nProbably they are all doing it in various degrees. Pull up or dig up a\r\nfew plants when growing actively, not too early nor too late in the\r\nseason, and look for nodules on the roots. Number and size considered\r\ntogether will measure their activity in this line in your soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBean Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to plant beans of different varieties. The land is rich, black\r\nloam with a little sand. When is the best time to plant? If planted\r\nearly, what shall we do to keep the weevils out of them?\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to plant beans as early as you can without encountering\r\ndanger of frost killing. No particular date can be mentioned for\r\nplanting because the dates will vary in different locations according to\r\nthe beginning of the frost-free period. The best way to escape weevil is\r\nto sell most of the beans as soon as harvested, treating those which you\r\nretain for seed, or for your own use, with bisulphide of carbon vapor or\r\nby gently heating to a temperature not above 130 degrees, which, of\r\ncourse, must be done carefully with an accurate thermometer so as not to\r\ninjure germinating power. Unless you know that beans do well in your\r\nlocality, it would be wise to plant a small area at first, because beans\r\nare somewhat particular in their choice of location in California, and\r\none should have practical demonstration of bearing before risking much\r\nupon the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yard-Long Bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to ask about the very long bean which I think was introduced from\r\nChina into California. I remember seeing one vine when I was living in\r\nCalifornia which I think must have been 20 or 30 feet long and had\r\nhundreds of pods and each of these pods were from 2 to 3 feet long. Are\r\nthese beans generally considered eatable? Would they be at all suitable\r\nto get as a field bean which the hogs eat?\r\n\r\nYou probably refer to the \"yard-long\" pole bean. It is a world variety\r\nand may have come to California from China as you suggest, but it has\r\nalso been well known for generations in Europe and was brought thence to\r\nthe Eastern States at some early date. It is generally accounted as an\r\nunimportant species and certainly has not risen to commercial account in\r\nCalifornia. The beans are edible and the whole plant available for stock\r\nfeeding, but there is no doubt but that the growth of some of the\r\ncowpeas would be preferable as a summer field crop for hog pasture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the Beans are Waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell me why pink beans which were planted early in Merced\r\ncounty, irrigated four times, hoed four times and cultivated, have no\r\nbeans on them? The vines look finely.\r\n\r\nProbably because you had too much hot, dry wind at the blooming. This is\r\none of the most frequent troubles with beans in the hot valley, but the\r\npink bean resists it better than other varieties. As the heat moderates\r\nyou are likely to get blossoms which will come through and form pods,\r\nand then the crop will depend upon how long frost is postponed. You have\r\nalso treated the plants a little too well with water and cultivation.\r\nYou had better let them feel the pinch of poverty a little now; they\r\nwill be more likely to go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackeye Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to prepare land for Black-eye beans? How much seed\r\nis required per acre, and what is the estimated cost of growing them?\r\nThe soil is a well-drained clay loam.\r\n\r\nThe cost of growing is not particularly different from other beans, and\r\nwill vary, of course, according to the capacity and efficiency of the\r\nplows, harrows, teams, tractors, men, etc. Every man has to figure that\r\naccording to his conditions and methods of turning and fining the land.\r\nSow 40 pounds per acre in drills 3 feet apart, and cultivate as long as\r\nyou can without injuring the vines too much. Sowing must of course be\r\ndone late, after the ground is warm and danger of frost is past, though\r\nthe plowing and harrowing should be done earlier than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackeye Beans are Cow Peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sent for some Blackeye cow peas; they look like Blackeye beans. Am\r\nsending you a sample of what I got. What are they?\r\n\r\nYes, they are in the cow pea group, but there are other cow peas which\r\nwould not be recognized as having any relation to them. All cow peas\r\nare, however, beans, and they have not much use for frost. They are not\r\nhardy like the true pea group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Horse Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the soil need to be inoculated for horse beans? I intend to plant\r\nfive acres about January 1, on the valley border in Placer county and\r\nthey get heavy frost in the morning. Does frost hurt them? How shall I\r\nplant them?\r\n\r\nCalifornia experience is that horse beans grow readily without\r\ninoculation of the seed. Quite a good growth of the plant is being\r\nsecured in many parts of the State, particularly in the coast region\r\nwhere the plant seems to thrive best. It is one of the hardiest of the\r\nbean family and will endure light frost. How hardy it will prove in your\r\nplace could be told only by a local experiment. Whether it can be\r\nplanted after frost danger is over, as corn is, and make satisfactory\r\ngrowth and product in the dry heat of the interior summer must also be\r\ndetermined by experience.\r\n\r\nThe horse bean is a tall growing, upright plant which is successfully\r\ngrown in rows far enough apart for cultivation, say about 2 1/2 feet,\r\nthe seed dropped thinly so that the plants will stand from 6 inches to 1\r\nfoot apart in the row.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Castor Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive information on the castor oil bean; the kind of bean best to plant,\r\nwhen to plant and harvest, the best soil, and where one can market them.\r\n\r\nCastor bean growing has been undertaken from time to time since 1860 in\r\nvarious parts of California. There is no difficulty about getting a\r\nsatisfactory growth of the plant in parts of the State where moisture\r\nenough can be depended upon. Although the growing of beans is easy\r\nenough, the harvesting is a difficult proposition, because in California\r\nthe clusters ripen from time to time, have to be gathered by hand, to be\r\nput in the sun to dry, and finally threshed when they are popping\r\nproperly. The low price, in connection with the amount of hand work\r\nwhich has to be done upon the crop, has removed all the attractions for\r\nCalifornia growers. There is also, some years, an excess of production\r\nin the central West, which causes prices to fall and makes it still more\r\nimpracticable to make money from the crop with the ordinary rates of\r\nlabor. The oil cannot be economically extracted except by the aid of the\r\nmost effective machinery and a well equipped establishment. Oil-making\r\nin the rude way in which it is conducted in India would certainly not be\r\nprofitable here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegume Seed Inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any virtue in inoculating plants with the bacteria that some\r\nseed firms offer? I refer to such plants as peas and beans.\r\n\r\nIf the land is yielding good crops of these plants and the roots are\r\nnoduled, it does not need addition of germs. If the growth is scant even\r\nwhen there is enough moisture present and the roots are free from\r\nnodules, the presumption is that germs should be added. Speaking\r\ngenerally, added germs are not needed in California because our great\r\nlegume crops are made without inoculation. Presumably, burr clover and\r\nour host of native legumes have already charged the soil with them. If,\r\nhowever, such plants do not do well, try inoculation by all means, to\r\nsee if absence of germs is the reason for such failure or whether you\r\nmust look for some other reason. If the results are satisfactory, you\r\nmay have made a great gain by introduction of desirable soil organisms\r\nwhich you can extend as you like by the distribution of the germ-laden\r\nsoil from the areas which have been given that character by inoculation\r\nof the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeans on Irrigated Mesas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould white and pink beans do well on the red orange land at Palermo\r\nwith plenty of water? I have in mind hill land, the hills being very red\r\nand running into a dark soil in the lower part. How many beans could I\r\nget per acre?\r\n\r\nProbably nothing would be better for the land or for the future needs of\r\nthe trees than to grow beans. An average crop of beans, for the whole\r\nState and all kinds of beans, is about one ton to the acre. What you\r\nwill get by irrigation on hot uplands we do not know. Beans do not like\r\ndry heat, even if the soil moisture is adequate. They do not fructify\r\nwell even when they grow well. The pink bean does best under such\r\nconditions. All beans, except horse beans, must be brought up after\r\nfrost dangers are all over, and this brings them into high heat almost\r\nfrom the start in such a place as you mention. You should find out\r\nlocally how beans perform under such conditions as you have, before\r\nundertaking much investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeases for Sugar Beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land in Yolo county that has made an average yield yearly of from\r\n12 to 18 sacks of wheat and barley. A beet sugar company proposes\r\nrenting this land and plant it to sugar beets and I would prefer not to\r\nconsider any agreement of less than five years' duration. The particular\r\npoint that I would like to have you advise me on is the effect sugar\r\nbeet has upon the soil.\r\n\r\nYou certainly have good soil, and it is not strange that a sugar company\r\nshould desire to rent it for its purposes. There is, however, a great\r\nquestion as to whether it would be desirable to run to beets continually\r\nfor five years. Beets make a strong draft on some components of the\r\nsoil, and it is a common experience that they should not be grown year\r\nafter year for a long period, but should take their place in a rotation,\r\nin the course of which one or two crops of beets should be followed by a\r\ncrop of grain, and that if possible by a leguminous plant like alfalfa\r\nor an annual legume like burr clover used for pasturage, and then to\r\nbeets again. Beets improve soil for grain, because of the deep running\r\nof the root, and because beet culture is not profitable without deep\r\nplowing and continuous summer cultivation. This deepens and cleans the\r\nland to the manifest advantage of the grain crop, but still the beet\r\nreduces the plant food in the soil and some change of crop should be\r\nmade with reference to its restoration. We would much prefer to lease it\r\nfor two years than for five years of beet growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopping Mangel Wurzels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes it harm the mangel wurzels if their tops ore cut off once a month?\r\n\r\nRemoving leaves will decrease the size and harden the tissues of the\r\nbeet root. If you wish to grow the plant for the top, the root will\r\ncontinue to put out leaves for you for a time; if you grow it for the\r\nsize and quality of the root, you need all the leaf-action you can get,\r\ntherefore do not reduce the foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlooming Brussels Sprouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Brussels sprouts male and female? Some of my plants are flowering\r\nand show no signs of sprouts, while those that are not, show some small\r\neyes at stem that look like young sprouts.\r\n\r\nBrussels sprouts ought to form the sprouts without flowering, just as a\r\ncabbage heads without flowering. Those plants which show flowers have\r\nbeen stopped by drought or otherwise, and have taken on prematurely the\r\nsecond stage of growth which is productive of seed and is undesirable\r\nfrom the point of view of growing heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlanching Celery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI desire to know the different methods by which the celery is bleached,\r\nand particularly whether boards or other material other than earth is\r\nused for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is some blanching of celery with boards, cloth wrappings,\r\nboot-legs, old tiles, sewer pipes, etc., in market gardens in different\r\nparts of the State, but the great commercial product of celery for\r\nexport is blanched wholly by piling the light, dry earth against the\r\ngrowing plant. As we do not have rains during the growing season and as\r\nthe soil on which celery is chiefly grown is particularly coarse in its\r\ntexture, there is no rusting or staining from this method of blanching.\r\nIt shakes out clean and bright. Conditions which make earth-blanching\r\nundesirable in the humid region do not exist here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorn in the Sacramento Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it practical to raise corn in the Sacramento volley? Are the soil and\r\nclimatic conditions suitable?\r\n\r\nThe success of corn on plains and uplands in the Sacramento valley has\r\nnot yet been fully demonstrated, although good corn is grown on river\r\nbottom lands, and it is possible that much more may be done with this\r\ngrain in the future than in the past. Corn does not enjoy the dry heat\r\nof the plains, and even when irrigated seems to be dissatisfied with it.\r\nHow far we shall succeed in getting varieties which will endure dry heat\r\nand still be large and productive will ere long be determined by the\r\nexperiments which are in progress. The old Sacramento valley farmer has\r\nbeen justified to some degree in his conclusion that his is not a corn\r\ncountry. Still it may appear so later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant Corn in Warm Ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also put in a lot of corn and none of it came up. The ground was damp\r\nand rather cold, as well as being alkali.\r\n\r\nCorn should never be planted in cold, wet ground - in fact, very few\r\nseeds should be. Besides, corn has no use for alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Corn in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been informed that sweet corn cannot be raised in this part of\r\nthe country, an account of worms eating the kernels before the ear has\r\nmatured. Is there any method of overcoming this difficulty?\r\n\r\nYou have been correctly informed concerning the difficulty in growing\r\nsweet corn. Although many experiments have been made, no method of\r\novercoming this pest has yet been demonstrated. For this reason canning\r\nof corn is not undertaken in this State, and for the same reason most of\r\nthe green corn ears sold in our markets have the tops of the ears\r\namputated. It is sometimes possible to escape the worm by planting\r\nrather late, so that the ears shall develop after the moth, which is\r\nparent of the worm, has deposited its eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForcing Cucumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive information on growing hot-house cucumbers, and also if you think\r\nit would pay me to go into the business in southern California.\r\n\r\nForcing of cucumbers has been undertaken for a number of years in\r\nCalifornia and formerly was considered unprofitable because cucumbers\r\ngrown in the open air in frostless places came in before the forced\r\nproduct could be sold out at sufficiently high prices to make the\r\nventure profitable. Recently, however, owing to our increased population\r\nin cities and larger demand of products out of season, forcing becomes\r\nmore promising and is worthy of attention. Forcing of cucumbers in\r\nCalifornia can be done at very much less expense, of course, than\r\nelsewhere, because of the abundance of winter sunshine and the fact that\r\nsufficiently high temperatures can be secured in glass houses with\r\nexceedingly little if any artificial heat: The chances of growing\r\ncucumbers out of season for shipment eastward and northward can be\r\ndiscussed with the officers of the California Vegetable Growers' Union,\r\nwhich has offices and warehouse in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCucumber Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a piece of red so-called orange land which has produced excellent\r\nwheat. Will you give information about its adaptability to cucumbers?\r\nAre there pickle factories in the State which would demand them in\r\nquantities, and is there much other demand for them? About when should\r\nthey be planted, and how much water would they need?\r\n\r\nThe cucumber needs a retentive soil which does not crack and bake, and\r\nsuch a soil is made by abundance of organic matter. Your orange soil,\r\nunless heavily treated with stable manure and given plenty of time for\r\ndisintegration, would probably give you distressful cucumber plants, if\r\nit has come right out of wheat-growing. Besides, cucumbers do not like\r\ndry heat, even if the soil be kept moist by irrigation. Oranges will do\r\nwell under conditions not favorable to cucumbers. Cucumber plants must\r\ncome up after danger of frost is over. The amount of water they require\r\ndepends upon how moist the soil is naturally, and as the crop is chiefly\r\ngrown on moist river lands and around the bay, it is chiefly made\r\nwithout irrigation. Such lands have a cucumber capacity equal to the\r\nconsumption of the United States, probably, and the pickle factories can\r\nusually get all they can use at a minimum transportation cost.\r\nLarge-scale plantings should only be made by men who know the crop and\r\nhave definite information or contract for what they can get for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGinger in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have ginger roots in a growing condition with sprouts and bulbs\r\ngrowing an them, but we do not understand how to raise the plants.\r\n\r\nGrowing ginger in California in a commercial way has not been worked\r\nout, although roots have been introduced from time to time. Plant your\r\nroots in the garden, just as you would callas, where you can give them\r\ngood cultivation and water, as seems to be necessary, and note their\r\nbehavior under these favorable conditions before you undertake any large\r\ninvestment in a crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicorice Growing in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have for some time been seeking far some information as to the method\r\nof preparation for market and sale of licorice roots. I have a lot of\r\nthem and have never been able to find a market, and do not know how they\r\nare prepared for market.\r\n\r\nLicorice was first planted in California about 1880 by the late Isaac\r\nLea, of Florin, Sacramento county. Mr. Lea grew a considerable amount of\r\nlicorice roots and gave much effort to finding a market for it. He found\r\nthat the local consumption of licorice root was too small to warrant\r\ngrowing it as a crop; that the high price of labor in digging the roots,\r\nand the high cost of transportation of the roots to Eastern markets\r\nwould make it impossible for him to undertake competition in the Eastern\r\nmarkets with the Sicilian producers, unless, perhaps, he could build an\r\nextracting factory and market licorice extract, the black solid which is\r\nsold by the druggist, and which the Sicilians produce in large\r\nquantities. The preparation of licorice root is simply digging and\r\ndrying, but the preparation of the extract requires steam extractors and\r\ncondensers. California could produce licorice, for we have a good\r\nclimate for it. If it is grown on light, sandy loams, it could be pulled\r\nfrom the ground by the yard at rather small expense, and yet, one should\r\nnot undertake the production unless he wished to put in much time and\r\nmoney in working up economical production and marketing in competition\r\nwith the foreign product, produced by cheap labor and with the advantage\r\nof processes well known and established by long usage. Experiments\r\nshould be circumspectly undertaken, for licorice is one of the worst\r\nweeds in the world, and extremely difficult of eradication probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Lentils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive information regarding the planting and raising of lentils. Can they\r\nbe grown in the Sacramento valley in the vicinity of Colusa, and at a\r\nprofit?\r\n\r\nLentils are as easily grown in California as common peas, and will do\r\nwell as a field crop if started during the rainy season, as they are\r\nhardy enough to survive our ordinary valley frosts. With respect to\r\nlentils, it may be said that excellent as these legumes are for many\r\npurposes, they do not seem to be well known to American consumers, and\r\ntherefore the amount to be grown is limited, until you know who will buy\r\nlarger quantities of them at a good price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCanada Peas for Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to raise Canada peas for the seed. In what month of the year is\r\nthe best time to plant them; also how many pounds to the acre to be\r\nsowed broadcast on rolling land in Napa?\r\n\r\nBroadcast from 80 to 100 pounds of seed per acre as soon as you can get\r\nthe ground into good condition. What you get will depend much upon how\r\nlate spring rains hold this year. We should only try a small area this\r\nyear to see what happens, for you probably should have started earlier\r\nin the season. On uplands it will always be a question whether your soil\r\nwill hold moisture enough to mature a good seed crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Niles Peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I plant and handle a crop of Niles peas?\r\n\r\nNiles peas are hardy and will make a good crop on any good soil, if\r\nplanted early in the season so as to make the main part of their growth\r\nbefore the heat of the summer comes on. Under garden conditions they\r\ncan, of course, be grown all summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransplanting Lettuce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lettuce plants that have been transplanted to head. Occasionally\r\nI find a head that has withered away and upon examining it find it\r\nrotted away at the stem. Can you suggest a remedy for it?\r\n\r\nYour lettuce plants are destroyed by the \"damping, off\" fungus. It would\r\nbe preventable by reducing the amount of moisture until the transplanted\r\nplant had opportunity to re-establish itself in the soil and thus come\r\ninto condition to take water. The chance of it could also be reduced by\r\nusing a certain amount of sand in connection with the soil, unless it is\r\nalready very sandy, and by a shallow covering of sand on the surface\r\naround the plants after they are reset, in order to prevent too great\r\naccumulation of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Winter Melons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive particulars regarding harvesting, storaging, and shipment of winter\r\nmelons. How do you harvest and pack them for distant market?\r\n\r\nThere is no particular system in the handling of winter melons. They are\r\ngathered into piles on ground where water will not gather and covered\r\nwith the trash of the vines on which they grow. They will keep for\r\nmonths in this way, as our autumn temperatures do not freeze them. Other\r\ngrowers collect them in open sheds shaded from sun and rain, and still\r\nothers put them into barns or shallow cellars under buildings, etc. The\r\nmelons are very durable and seem disposed to keep in any old way. The\r\nmelons are shipped in large packing cases with slat sides, or in the\r\nsmaller slat crates that are used for summer cantaloupes. No packing is\r\nused, generally. If it seemed necessary, a little clean straw would be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRipe Melons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I tell when a watermelon is fully ripe? What is the method used\r\nby growers in picking for commercial shipping?\r\n\r\nGently press the sides of a melon and if it crackles a little bit, all\r\nright; if it makes no sound then go to another. Commercial pickers look\r\nat the little spiral between the melon and the nearest leaf. If it is\r\nwithered they pick the melon, if fresh, pass it until next picking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Onion Seed and Sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you give localities of the leading production of onion seed or dry\r\nsets in your State?\r\n\r\nOnion seed is grown in several parts of the State, largely in the Santa\r\nClara valley adjacent to the city of San Jose. Onion sets are largely\r\nproduced in Orange county, near Los Angeles, for eastern shipment, for\r\nwhich purpose they are grown under contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRipening Onions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am raising some onions from bottom sets and as they are growing nicely\r\nand are beginning to swell at the bulb some advise me to cut the tops\r\noff and some advise me to bend them over or tramp them down.\r\n\r\nDo not cut off the tops of the onions. If they seem to be overgrowing\r\nand not disposed to ripen the bulb, the top can be broken down, thus\r\npartly arresting the vegetative energy of the plant and causing\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnions from Sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill onion sets planted in July grow and mature in the fall months?\r\n\r\nGood onion sets grown during the winter and spring should be mature by\r\nJuly and if planted after drying would proceed to make a full growth of\r\nlarge onions if growing conditions should be right for them; that is,\r\nthe soil moist and the temperature not too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Crops of Onion Seed?\r\n\r\nDoes the growing of onion seed exhaust adobe land, and if so, how many\r\nyears' cropping before it requires rest or fertilizing?\r\n\r\nThe growth of any seed crop, including cereal grains, of course, makes a\r\nsupreme draft upon soil fertility. How long a certain soil can stand it,\r\ndepends upon the amount of fertility it has when the draft begins. The\r\nbest rough way to tell how it is going, is to watch the growth and crop,\r\nwhen moisture conditions are known to be favorable. If you get a good\r\ngrowth of the plant it is still good to make the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnions from Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill onions from seed mature the same season if they are irrigated? Some\r\ntell us they will not, so we would be very much pleased to hear from\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nOnions grown from the seed do fully develop during the growing season\r\nfollowing the planting of the seed. In fact, nearly all California\r\nonions are grown in that way. Our growing season is so long that we do\r\nnot need to use onion sets to any extent, as they do in short-summer\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Farming with Chili Peppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I set chili pepper plants down six or eight inches lower than the\r\nsurface of the ground and fill in as the plants grow larger, will this\r\nhelp in case I could not get water enough? My soil is a deep sandy loam.\r\nWe have had between five and six inches of rain. Do you think water\r\nevery fifteen days would be enough?\r\n\r\nOn such light soil as you mention, the plants can be planted deeply and\r\na certain amount of soil brought up to the plants by cultivation without\r\ninjury. As this plant has a long growing season and matures its crop\r\nrather late, you will undoubtedly need irrigation. Probably irrigation\r\ntwice a month will be sufficient in connection with good cultivation,\r\nbut you will have to watch the plants and apply the water as it seems to\r\nbe needed, rather than by a specific scheme of days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvesting Peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like information regarding the curing of peanuts. Should they be\r\nbleached, and, if so, how is it done? Does bleaching affect the keeping\r\nqualities?\r\n\r\nIt is not usual to bleach peanuts. They should be grown in such light\r\nsoil that they will not be stained, and the common method of curing is\r\nto dig or plow up, throw the vines, with nuts attached, into windrows\r\nand allow them to lie a week or ten days for drying. Then the nuts are\r\npicked into sacks and cleaned before shipment in revolving drums,\r\nfollowed by a grain fan which throws out the light nuts and other\r\nrubbish. Bleaching would not destroy the keeping quality probably, but\r\nit would destroy the flavor and the germinating power. The latter would\r\nnot matter, except with such nuts as you wish to keep for seed, because\r\nthe roasting destroys the germinating power also, but sulphuring, which\r\nwould reduce the flavor, would give the product a bad name. Possibly\r\nsome growers do bleaching, but, if so, they have to be pretty careful\r\nabout it. The cost of the operation would also be a bar to profit, for\r\npeanuts are grown on a narrow margin owing to competition with\r\nimportations grown with cheap labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdobe and Peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs adobe land good for the peanut? Is it harder to start than in other\r\nsoils or not?\r\n\r\nIt is not good at all. Peanuts require the finest, mellowest loam with\r\nsand enough to prevent crust, and moisture even and continuous. The\r\nsurface must be kept loose so that the plant can bury its own bloom stem\r\nand the under soil light and clean so that it will readily shake from\r\nthe nuts and not stain them. Adobe is the worst soil you could find for\r\npeanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be the most profitable potato to plant in the Salinas valley,\r\nand how small can a potato be cut up for planting? How many eyes should\r\neach piece contain in order to make a good growth and be profitable?\r\n\r\nProbably the best potato for your district would be the Burbank, which\r\nis largely grown near Salinas and brings the highest price. It is\r\ncustomary to cut a medium-sized potato in two pieces and a large one in\r\nfour pieces. One can be very economical of seed by smaller cutting, but\r\nit would require the most favorable conditions to bring a vigorous\r\ngrowth. Probably pieces weighing not less than two ounces would be best\r\nunder ordinary conditions. Potatoes which are rather small may be used\r\nfor seed if well matured and have good eyes. It is dangerous, however,\r\nto use the small stuff - too small for sale. Unless the soil and\r\nmoisture conditions are extra favorable, the growth will be weak and\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many sacks of potatoes are to be planted to an acre, and how many\r\neyes are to be left in a seed? If, for instance, we plant seed with\r\nthree eyes, how many potatoes should we get from that vine?\r\n\r\nPotatoes are planted all the way from five to fifteen sacks to the acre,\r\nprobably about ten sacks being the average. There is no particular\r\nnumber of eyes specified in preparing the seed, according to common\r\npractice. Good medium-sized potatoes are generally cut in two pieces\r\ncrosswise, and large potatoes in four pieces, cutting both ways. There\r\nis no definite relation between the number of eyes planted and the\r\nnumber of potatoes coming from them. This has been the subject of\r\ninnumerable experiments, and the conclusion is that the crop is more\r\ndependent upon good soil and favorable growing conditions than upon any\r\nway of preparing the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthern Potatoes for Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you regard northern-grown seed potatoes sufficiently better to make\r\nit worth while paying freight on them from the State of Washington?\r\n\r\nExperience seems to indicate the superiority of northern-grown seed\r\npotatoes, not only in this State, but on the Atlantic Coast, and they\r\nare largely depended upon. Systematic demonstration by comparative tests\r\nhas been made by the Vermont station and preference for northern-grown\r\nseed seems, to be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have ten acres of land in Placer county which I propose to put into\r\npotatoes next spring. It has been recommended to me to put potatoes in\r\nas early as January. It seems to me that January is rather early;\r\nhowever, it is said that this land is in the orange belt and practically\r\nfree from frost.\r\n\r\nWhether you can plant potatoes to advantage in January or not depends\r\nupon the temperatures which you are likely to meet after that date, also\r\nwhether the ground is warm enough in January, because there is no\r\nadvantage in planting in cold ground nor in soil that is too wet at the\r\ntime. The earliest potatoes, of course, come from planting much earlier\r\nthan January; usually as soon as the ground is moistened enough in the\r\nautumn. The potato will stand some frost, but autumn planting is not\r\nfeasible in places which are under hard freezing or receive too much\r\ncold rain water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotatoes Should be Planted Early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have Early Rose potatoes planted about May first. The tops look fine,\r\nbut there are few potatoes and small, and, though not developed, have\r\ncommenced growing a second time, sprouts starting from the new potatoes.\r\nWhen should I plant and what care should they have?\r\n\r\nYour potatoes act peculiarly because of intermittent moisture - the\r\nplant being arrested by drought and then starting again, which is very\r\nundesirable. To avoid this, potatoes should be planted earlier so as to\r\nget a large part of their growth during the rainy season. If planted\r\nlate the ground should be well wet down by irrigation, and then plowed\r\nand cultivated, and irrigation should be used while the plant is growing\r\nwell. If this is done, potatoes can be successfully grown by irrigation,\r\nbut if the land is allowed to become dry the plant is arrested in its\r\ngrowth for a time and a second and undesirable growth is started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find in potato writings of forty years ago that the seed from the\r\npotato balls which form on the tops of the plants is recommended for\r\ngrowing the best potatoes. In later books I find no mention of them and\r\nall are advised how to cut the tubers to get seed potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the potato plant which is found in the \"balls\" which develop\r\non the tops of the plant is only valuable for the origination of new\r\nvarieties, with the chance, of course, that most of them will be\r\ninferior to the tubers produced by the plant which bears the seed.\r\nTherefore, these seeds are of no commercial importance. There has also\r\nsometimes developed upon the top of the plant what is called an aerial\r\ntuber, which is even of less value than the seed ball, because it does\r\nnot contain seed nor is it good as a tuber.\r\n\r\nForty years ago there was a great demand for newer and better kinds of\r\npotatoes which has, since that time, been largely supplied, and\r\ncommercial potato-growing consists in multiplying the standard varieties\r\nwhich best suit the soil and the market. This is done by planting the\r\ntuber itself, which is really a root-cutting and therefore reproduces\r\nits own kind. Those who are originating new kinds of potatoes still use\r\nseed from the balls, either taking their chances by natural variation\r\nor, by hybridizing the blossoms, increasing the chances for variation\r\nfrom which desirable varieties are taken by selection, to be afterward\r\nmultiplied by growth from the tubers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed-Ends of Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it bad practice to plant the seed-ends of potatoes?\r\n\r\nThe seed-end of the potato is the least valuable part of it, but it is\r\nbetter probably to plant than to reject it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon and Potato Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any foundation to the oft-repeated story about potatoes in the\r\nlight of the moon running to tops and the dark of the moon to spuds?\r\n\r\nIf we paid any attention to the moon in planting, we should plant in the\r\ndark of the moon so as to give the plant opportunity to make use of\r\nwhatever additional light the full moon afforded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting Whole Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne man states the only way to cut seed is to take a potato and cut the\r\nends off and not divide the potato any more; or, in other words, a whole\r\npotato for each seed.\r\n\r\nGood results are obtained by planting whole potatoes, but in that case\r\nthere is no advantage in removing the ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Cut Seed Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it pay in returns to use large potatoes for seed in preference to\r\nculls?\r\n\r\nLarge potatoes are better than culls, but medium-sized potatoes are\r\nbetter than either. Many experiments have been made to determine this.\r\nAt the Arkansas station whole tubers two to three inches in diameter\r\nyielded 18 per cent more than small whole tubers three-quarters to one\r\nand one-quarter inches in diameter, and large cut tubers yielded 15.8\r\nper cent more than small cut tubers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Potatoes to Single Eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome say only one eye to a piece; others say several eyes - which is\r\nbetter?\r\n\r\nIn one experiment potatoes cut to single eyes with each piece weighing\r\none-sixteenth of an ounce yielded 44 bushels to the acre, while single\r\neyes on two-ounce pieces yielded 177 bushels to the acre. Experiments in\r\nIndiana showed that the yield usually increased with the weight of the\r\nset and that the exact number of eyes per cutting is relatively\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Scab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan potatoes be treated in any way before planting to prevent the new\r\nones from being what is called \"scabby\"?\r\n\r\nThere are two successful treatments for scab in potatoes. One is dipping\r\nin a solution of corrosive sublimate. Dissolve one ounce in eight\r\ngallons of water and soak the seed potatoes in this solution for one and\r\none-half hours before cutting. This treatment kills the scab spores\r\nwhich may be upon the exterior of the potatoes. More recently, however,\r\nto avoid danger in handling such a rank poison as corrosive sublimate,\r\nformaldehyde has been used, and one pint of commercial formaldehyde, as\r\nit is bought in the stores, is diluted with thirty gallons of water, and\r\npotatoes are soaked in this for two hours. Thirty gallons of this dip\r\nought to treat about fifty bushels of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble-Cropping with Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am told that here two crops of potatoes can be raised by planting the\r\nsecond crop in August. I have five acres which will be ready to dig in\r\nJuly. Can I dig these Potatoes and use them for seed at once for another\r\ncrop, or won't they grow? I have a crop of barley, and as it is heading\r\nout now, I want to put potatoes on the ground after I take the barley\r\noff. I have plenty of water to irrigate.\r\n\r\nIf your potatoes ripen in July and you allow those which you desire for\r\nseed to lie upon the ground and become somewhat greenish, they are\r\nlikely to sprout well for a second crop. They should not, however, be\r\nplanted immediately. Whether you get a second crop successfully or not\r\ndepends upon how early the frosts come in your district. Whether you get\r\npotatoes after barley or not depends also upon how much moisture there\r\nremains in the soil. By irrigating thoroughly after harvesting the grain\r\nand then plowing deeply for potatoes, you would do vastly better than to\r\nplant in dry ground and irrigate afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Plant Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been puzzled to understand Potato growing in California. Do you\r\nhave more than one cropping season, and if so, about what dates are they\r\ndue?\r\n\r\nEvery month in the year potatoes are being put into the ground and being\r\ntaken out of the ground somewhere in California. We have, then,\r\npractically a continuous planting and harvesting season. There is,\r\nhowever, a division possible to make in this way: Plantings undertaken\r\nin September and October are for winter supplies of new potatoes, which\r\nbegin about the holidays and continue during the winter. There is also\r\nin southern California a planting beginning in January, which might be\r\ncalled the earliest planting for the main crop, and other plantings for\r\nthe main crop in the central and northern parts of the State begin in\r\nFebruary and continue until May, according to the character of the land;\r\nthat is, whether it is upland, on which the planting is earlier, or\r\nwhether it is lowland along the rivers where excessive moisture may\r\nrender the land unsuitable until April or May. The harvesting of the\r\nmain crop then begins in May and continues during the whole of the\r\nsummer, according to the character of the land cropped over, lapping the\r\nplanting time for early potatoes first mentioned. It is also true by use\r\nof properly matured seed one can secure, in some places, two crops a\r\nyear, if there is sufficient inducement therefor. Thus it comes about\r\nthat we are continually planting and digging potatoes according to local\r\nconditions and the possibility of selling advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvise me how to keep my potatoes. What is the best way? Would a dark\r\nroom be suitable? Some people are digging holes in the ground to put\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, if properly matured and free from disease, will keep for a\r\nconsiderable time in dark rooms kept as cool as possible. They must be\r\nkept away from the reach of the moth, which is parent to the worm\r\nproducing long black strings inside of the potato. If they are\r\nthoroughly covered with boards or sacking or straw, so as to keep the\r\nmoth from reaching the potato, they may be held for a long time in the\r\nopen air, and covering with earth, as your neighbors are doing, will be\r\nall right until the rains come and cause decay by making the soil too\r\nwet. The main point is to keep the tubers as cool as possible and out of\r\nreach of the potato moth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the yield per acre of potatoes on the best land around Stockton,\r\nCal., where work is done properly; also what is the yield for potatoes\r\nalong the coast?\r\n\r\nThe average yield of potatoes in California, taking the whole acreage\r\nand product as reported by the last United States census, is 147 bushels\r\nto the acre. In Stockton district, on good new reclaimed land the yield\r\nhas been reported all the way from 300 to 800 bushels per acre - the\r\ncrop declining rapidly when continued on the same land. One year's crop\r\nin the Stockton district was estimated at 45,000 acres averaging 125\r\nsacks per acre. The coast yield would be more like the general average\r\nfor the State as first given.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Potatoes for Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I plant American Wonder potatoes for the first crop, and let enough\r\nof them mature to use for seed for the second crop, to be planted the\r\nfirst or middle of July?\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use potatoes grown the same year as seed for the later\r\ncrop, providing you let the potatoes mature first by the complete dying\r\ndown of the vines, and second by digging the potatoes allow them to lie\r\nin the open air, with some protection against sun-burning, until the\r\npotatoes become somewhat greenish. If this is the case the eyes will\r\ndevelop and seed will grow, while without such treatment you might be\r\ndisappointed in their behavior. Of course, the question still remains\r\nwhether it would be desirable to do this or to plant some later variety\r\nearlier in the season when the growing conditions would be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what locality are the best early potatoes grown in California? Can\r\nthey be raised on wheat lands without irrigation as an early crop?\r\n\r\nEarly potatoes are grown in regions of light frosts in all parts of the\r\nState - around the bay of San Francisco, on the mesas in southern\r\nCalifornia, and to some extent at slight elevations in the central part\r\nof the State. The potato endures some frost, but one has, for an early\r\ncrop, to guard against the locations subject to hard freezing. Most of\r\nour potatoes are grown without irrigation because, on uplands, winter\r\ntemperatures favor their growing during the rainy season. The\r\nmiddle-season and late potatoes are grown on moist lowlands where\r\nirrigation is not necessary. In proper situations, much of the land\r\nwhich is used for potatoes has at some time produced wheat or barley,\r\ncorn or sorghum, and other field crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotatoes After Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been a successful potato grower in Ohio. I have the best alfalfa\r\nsoil and it is now in its fourth year of productiveness in that crop. I\r\nwould like to grow potatoes in a small way.\r\n\r\nProceed just as you would at the East in getting potatoes upon a red\r\nclover sod. Turn under the alfalfa deeply now if the soil will work\r\nwell, and roll your sandy soil. You must use a sharp plow to cut and\r\ncover well. If there is moisture enough the alfalfa, plowed under in the\r\nfall, ought to be decayed by February, when you could plant potatoes\r\nsafely, probably, unless your situation is very frosty. If you plant\r\nearly you ought to get the crop through without irrigation if you\r\ncultivate well and keep the land flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlat or Hill Culture for Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better to hill potatoes or not?\r\n\r\nDuring the dry time of the year potatoes should be grown with flat\r\ncultivation, except as it may be necessary to furrow out between the\r\nrows for the application of irrigation water. Potatoes grown during the\r\nrainy season in places where there is liable to be too much water, can\r\noften be hilled to advantage, but dry-season cultivation of practically\r\neverything should be as flat as possible to retain moisture near the\r\nsurface for the development of shallow-rooting plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBad Conditions for Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur potatoes were planted early and were frosted several times while\r\nyoung. As we come to harvest them we find them with very large green\r\ntops but the potatoes are about the size of a hen's egg and from that\r\nthey run down to the size of a pea. The larger ones are beginning to\r\nsend out roots, four or five to a potato. The potatoes have not been\r\nirrigated lately and the ground they are in is dry.\r\n\r\nThe ugly behavior of your potatoes is doubtless due to irregularities in\r\ntemperature and moisture which have forced the plants into abnormal or\r\nundesirable activity. Potatoes should have regular conditions of\r\nmoisture so that they shall proceed from start to finish and not stop\r\nand start again, for this will usually make the crop unsatisfactory and\r\nworthless. Excessive moisture is not desirable, but the requisite amount\r\nin continuous supply is indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotatoes on Heavy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill potatoes grow well in adobe land, or partly adobe, that has not\r\nbeen used for seven years except for pasturing?\r\n\r\nAlthough potatoes enjoy best of all a light loam in which they can\r\nreadily expand, it is possible to get very good results on heavy land\r\nwhich has been used for pasturage for some years, providing the land is\r\nbroken up early and deeply and harrowed well in advance of planting and\r\nthorough cultivation maintained while the crop is growing. The content\r\nof grass roots and manure which the land has received during its period\r\nof grazing tends to make the soil lighter and will also feed the plant\r\nwell. For this reason better potatoes are had on heavy land after\r\npasturage than could be had on the same land if continually used for\r\ngrain or for some other crop which tended to reduce the amount of humus\r\nand to make the land more rebellious in cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage of Seed Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need potatoes for late planting and have found a good lot which is\r\nbeing held in cold storage at temperatures from 34 to 36 degrees F. They\r\nhave not been there long, however. Would that hurt them for seed, and\r\nalso how long could they be safely left there now before planting?\r\n\r\nSeed potatoes would not be injured in storage, providing the temperature\r\nis not allowed to go below the freezing point. They should not, however,\r\nbe allowed to remain longer in storage, but should be exposed to the sun\r\nfor the development of the eyes, even to the sprouting point being\r\ndesirable before planting. The greening of the potato by the sun is no\r\ndisadvantage. We would not think of planting potatoes directly from\r\nstorage, because, owing to the lack of development in the eyes, decay\r\nmight get the start of germination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotatoes and Frosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I keep frost off of potato tops by building smudge fires! I would\r\nlike to plant about February 1, but we usually have a few light frosts\r\nhere during March. If I were to turn water in the field when too cold,\r\nwould that keep the frost off, and if so, would I have to turn water\r\ndown each row, or would one furrow full of water to about every fourth\r\nor sixth row be enough?\r\n\r\nYou can prevent frost by smudging for potatoes just as you can for other\r\nvegetables. The potato, however, needs little protection of this kind\r\nand will endure a light frost which would be destructive to tomatoes,\r\nmelons, and other more tender growths. Unless you have a very frosty\r\nsituation, you can certainly grow potatoes without frost protection, and\r\nthey should be planted earlier than February first if the ground is in\r\ngood condition. The great secret of success in growing potatoes in\r\nsouthern California is to get a good early start before the heat and\r\ndrought come on. Water will protect from frost if the temperature only\r\ngoes to about 28 degrees and does not stay there too long. The more\r\nwater there is exposed the longer may be the protection, but probably\r\nnot against a lower temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Sweet Potato Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I make a hot-bed to raise sweet potato plants? I don't mean to\r\nput glass over bed, but want full description of an up-to-date outfit\r\nfor raising them.\r\n\r\nManure hot-beds have been largely abandoned for growing sweet potato\r\nslips, though, of course, you can grow them that way on a small scale or\r\nfor experiment. In the large sweet potato districts, elaborate\r\narrangements for bottom heat by circulation of hot water or steam are in\r\nuse. In a smaller way hot air works well. The Arizona Experiment Station\r\ntells how a very good sweet potato hot-bed at little cost is constructed\r\nas follows: A frame of rough boards seven feet wide, twenty feet long\r\nand fourteen inches deep is laid down over two flues made by digging two\r\ntrenches one foot deep and about two feet wide, lengthwise of the bed.\r\nThese trenches are covered with plank or iron roofing, and are equipped\r\nwith a fire pit at one end and short smokestack at the other.\r\n\r\nFour inches of soil is filled into this bed and sweet potatoes placed\r\nupon it in a layer which is then covered with two or three inches more\r\nof soil. Large potatoes may be split and laid flat side down. The whole\r\nbed is then covered with muslin, operating on a roller by which to cover\r\nand uncover the bed. Thus prepared, the bed may easily be kept at a\r\ntemperature of 60 to 70 degrees F. by smouldering wood fires in the fire\r\nboxes. The potatoes, kept moist at this temperature, sprout promptly and\r\nwill be ready to transplant in about six weeks. A bed of the size\r\nmentioned will receive five to seven bushels of seed roots, which will\r\nmake slips enough to plant an acre or more of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Sweet Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease inform me how to keep sweet potatoes for seed; also how many\r\npounds it takes for one acre, and what distance apart to plant, and the\r\ntime to plant.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes may be kept from sprouting by storage in a cool, dry\r\nplace. Sweet potatoes are not grown by direct cutting of the tuber as\r\nthe ordinary potato is, but the tubers are put in January or later in a\r\nhot bed and the sprouts are taken off for planting when the ground\r\nbecomes warm and all danger of frost is over in the locality. The number\r\nof sprouts required for an acre is from five to ten thousand, and a\r\nbushel of small sweet potatoes will produce about two thousand sprouts\r\nif properly handled in the hot bed, which consists in removing the\r\nsprouts when they have attained a height of five or six inches, and in\r\nthis way the potatoes will be yielding sprouts in succession for some\r\ntime. The sprouts are planted in rows far enough apart for horse\r\ncultivation. They are usually hilled up pretty well after starting to\r\ngrow well. They cannot be planted until the danger of frost is over, for\r\nthey are much more tender than Irish potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Potato Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn planting sweet potatoes, do we have to make hotbeds just like those\r\nfor tomatoes, or if just a plain seed-bed will do? Is it necessary to\r\nirrigate them or not?\r\n\r\nYou can bed your sweet potatoes in a warm place on the sunny side of a\r\nbuilding or board fence, and get sprouts all right. You will, however,\r\nget them sooner and in greater numbers by using a slow hotbed in which\r\nthe manure supply is not too large. The fact that sweet potato growers\r\ndo use some artificial heat, either from manure or by piping bottom-heat\r\nin their propagating houses, is a demonstration that such recourse is\r\ndesirable to get best results. The necessity of irrigation depends upon\r\nthe soil and its natural moisture supply. On a fine retentive loam, the\r\ncrop is chiefly made without irrigation, if the plants are all ready to\r\nput out in the field as soon as it is safe. If you are late in the\r\nplanting, or if the soil is dry or likely to dry before the tubers are\r\ngrown to good size, irrigation, some time ahead of the need of the\r\nplant, is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of soil and climate does it take to grow sweet potatoes, and\r\ncan I grow them in any part of Contra Costa county, and about what time\r\nis the best to plant them?\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes do best in a light warm loam which drains well and does\r\nnot bake or crust by rain or irrigation. Sprout the tubers in a hot-bed\r\nor cold-frame in February and break off the shoots and plant as soon as\r\nyou are out of danger by frost. Sweet potatoes are more tender than\r\ncommon potatoes. There are places in Contra Costa county where they do\r\nwell, though some parts of the county do not have enough summer heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Potatoes Between Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am expecting to grow a fall crop of about twenty acres of sweet\r\npotatoes. The land is a heavy, sandy loam in the interior, which has\r\nbeen set out this spring to almonds, apricots and prunes. I wish to grow\r\nsweet potatoes between trees. Would an irrigation every forty days be\r\noften enough? Also, if either sweet or Irish potatoes grown between rows\r\nare harmful to either of the varieties of fruit mentioned?\r\n\r\nWe see no reason why you should not get your crop, providing you do not\r\nhave to run the plants into the frosty period, and sweet potatoes will\r\nnot, of course, stand frost as well as the common potato. The moisture\r\nwhich you propose to give ought to be enough for a retentive soil in\r\nconnection with good cultivation until the vines cover the ground.\r\nGrowing any crop between orchard trees is apt to be an injury to the\r\ntrees, because of the spaces which are not and cannot be adequately\r\ncultivated, so that the ground around the trees is apt to become\r\ncompacted either by the run of water or the lack of cultivation, or\r\nboth. Our observation has been that Irish potatoes are no more injurious\r\nthan other crops. Any crop will injure young trees if it takes moisture\r\nthey ought to have or interferes with good cultivation of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiant Japanese Radish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing sakurajima (giant Japanese radish) Eastern publications\r\nadvise planting late, about August 1, and not earlier than July 1. What\r\ncan you tell me about the plant here?\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic winter radishes can be successfully planted in California in\r\nJuly or August if the soil is thoroughly saturated by irrigation before\r\ndigging and planting. It is, however, not so necessary to begin early in\r\nCalifornia as at the East, because our winter temperatures favor the\r\ngrowth of the plant, while at the East they have to make an early start\r\nin order to get something well grown before the ground freezes. For the\r\ngrowth of winter radishes, then, in California you can wait until the\r\nground is wet thoroughly by the rain, which may be expected during\r\nSeptember, and afterward you can make later plantings for succession at\r\nany time you desire during the rainy season. This applies to all kinds\r\nof radishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRhubarb Rotting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have planted rhubarb roots in the San Joaquin valley and find the root\r\ncrowns rot below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned summer rhubarb usually goes off that way in very hot\r\nlocalities. If there is too much alkali or hardpan, or if planted too\r\nlate, the same results will be had with any sort of rhubarb. Where it is\r\nvery hot, plants, irrigated in the morning near the plants, scald at the\r\ncrown and die in a few days. If irrigated in the afternoon and the\r\nground worked before it gets hot the next day fine results are obtained.\r\nThe winter rhubarb varieties do well in hot districts if the roots are\r\nplanted from September 15 to May 1, while in cooler sections, April,\r\nMay, June and July are the best months and will insure a crop the\r\nfollowing winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSquashes Dislike Hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat caused these squashes, of which I send you samples, to be so hard\r\nand woody? They were grown without irrigation.\r\n\r\nYour squashes were grown without irrigation under conditions which were\r\ntoo dry for them and became inferior in quality. Possibly the variety\r\nitself is not of good quality or the specimen from which the seed was\r\ntaken may have been inferior. A squash, in order to be tender and\r\nacceptable, needs rich feeding and plenty of drink. Otherwise, it is apt\r\nto resent ill treatment by very undesirable growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvesting Sunflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the method used in saving or threshing the seed from the Giant\r\nRussian sunflower?\r\n\r\nCut off the seed heads of your sunflowers when the seed seems to be well\r\nmatured but before any of it falls away from the head. Throw these heads\r\non a smooth piece of ground or a tight floor and when they become\r\nthoroughly dry thresh out the seed with a flail, removing the coarse\r\nstuff with a rake and afterwards cleaning the seed by shoveling it into\r\nthe wind so that the light stuff may be blown away. A more perfect\r\ncleaning afterwards could be secured with a grain fanning mill or a\r\nsimple sieve of the right mesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Tomatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much water does it take (in gallons or cubic feet) to properly\r\nirrigate an acre of land for tomatoes? The soil is adobe, and the\r\ncustomary way of planting tomatoes is 6 feet apart each way, plowing a\r\ntrench of one furrow with the slope of the land for irrigating, that is,\r\na trench between every row and a cross trench as a feeder. The land is\r\nlow and in the driest part of the year the surface water is from 2 to 3\r\nfeet beneath the top of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to state a specific quantity of water for any crop,\r\nbecause the amount depends to such a large extent upon the retentiveness\r\nof the soil, the rate of evaporation and the kind of cultivation. The\r\nbest source of information is the behavior of the plant itself, bearing\r\nin mind that tomato plants require constant but not excessive moisture\r\nsupply, and that if moisture is applied in excess it will promote an\r\nexcessive growth of the plant, which will cause it to drop its blossoms\r\nand therefore be unsatisfactory and unproductive. In such land as you\r\ndescribe no irrigation whatever would be desirable except in years of\r\nshort rainfall, and such land, if properly cultivated, would always\r\nfurnish moisture enough by capillary action to support the growth of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLess Water and More Heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat chemicals should I put into the soil to insure a good crop of\r\nvegetables, such as tomatoes, string beans, or other over-ground\r\nproducers? Last year my tomatoes and string beans grew plentifully, but\r\nnever produced any tomatoes or beans, yet turnips and parsnips were all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nVegetables which behave like your tomatoes and string beans, making too\r\nmuch growth and not enough fruit, do not need fertilization. The land is\r\nperhaps too rich already, or you may have used too much water. Use less\r\nwater so that the plants will make a more moderate growth, and they will\r\nbe fruitful if the season is warm enough in the later part of summer.\r\nThis, of course, would be one of the drawbacks to growing tomatoes and\r\nbeans in San Francisco. Turnips and parsnips do well with less heat. You\r\nmay have to modify the San Francisco summer climate by wind screens or\r\nglass covers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuous Cropping With the Same Plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would happen on the crops of cucumbers, tomatoes and eggplants,\r\netc., planted on the same place continuously?\r\n\r\nThere would be in time a decadence of crop from soil exhaustion, but\r\nthat you could prevent by fertilization. The greatest danger from\r\ncontinuously growing these vegetables on the same land is the\r\nmultiplication of bacteria which injuriously affect them, in the soil.\r\nThe plants which you mention are all subject to \"wilt\" diseases from\r\nthis cause, therefore, they should have new ground. If you have to use\r\nthe same garden ground continuously, the plants which you mention should\r\nbe rotated with root crops or with other kinds of vegetables, so as to\r\nfrequently change plants and soil within the general area which has to\r\nbe used for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBig Worms on Tomatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a nice patch of tomatoes in my garden, and only recently I notice\r\nlarge green worms on them with one large brown horn on their head. They\r\nstrip the leaves off. They look to me like a tobacco worm.\r\n\r\nThey are tobacco worms; that is, they are the larvae of hawk moths, some\r\nof which take tobacco, tomatoes, grapevines and many other plants,\r\nincluding some of the native weeds of your valley. Pick them off and\r\ncrush them, or give them a little snip with the scissors if you do not\r\nlike to handle them. They are so large and easily found that such\r\ntreatment is easily applied, as in \"worming tobacco.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of Tomato Bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tomato plants which are very strong and healthy and full of\r\nblossoms, but there is something cutting the blossoms off and just about\r\nto ruin my plants.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with your tomato plants is that life is too easy for them,\r\nthat they have so much moisture and plant food that they can grow\r\ncomfortably and rapidly without thought of the future. So, because they\r\ndo not have to think of making fruit, the blossoms drop off. This is a\r\nvery common occurrence with tomatoes, especially in home gardens where\r\nthe owners have not the experience or the information on the subject\r\nthat they might have, and give the tomatoes too much water. Many other\r\nplants act the same way and will not set fruit while they can grow\r\neasily, and only begin to produce when they have made a great growth or\r\nwhen moisture begins to get a little short. If you irrigate the\r\ntomatoes, stop, and put no more water on until the plant begins to set\r\nfruit as if it meant business, or gives some sign that water would be\r\nappreciated. If the ground is naturally moist you will have to wait\r\nuntil the plants make more growth and the weather gets drier and hotter,\r\nand the plants will then set fruit. Some growers have found that by\r\ntrimming up the vine and staking it, the fruit sets much more readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III. Grains and Forage Crops\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWants Us to Do the Whole Thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you help, me to determine a good product to plant somewhere in\r\nCalifornia; also what particular section would be most suitable for the\r\nraising of that which you would advise? I wish a crop of permanent\r\nnature (as orchard trees). I also desire advice on some product which\r\nwould give a quick return while I am waiting on the more permanent one\r\nto mature and bear. I have not procured land yet, and am thinking\r\nseriously of trying to get government land, therefore, you are free to\r\ngive me the best location for the raising of that which you would,\r\nsuggest. I want a money-making product and one which is not already\r\noverdone.\r\n\r\nThe choice of crops depends quite as much upon the market demand and\r\nopportunity as it does upon the suitability of the soil and local\r\nclimate. Choice of crops indeed involves almost the whole business of\r\nfarming, and although we can sometimes give a man useful suggestions as\r\nto the growth of plants and the protection of plants from enemies, we\r\ncannot undertake to plan his farming business for him. He must form his\r\nown opinions as to what will be most marketable, and therefore\r\nprofitable, if he succeeds in getting a good article for sale. A wise\r\nman at the East once said: \"You can advise a man to do almost anything.\r\nYou can even select a wife for him, but never commit the indiscretion of\r\nadvising him what to grow to make money. That is a matter he has to\r\ndetermine for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPasturing Young Grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be advisable to herd milch cows for a few hours each day on a\r\nfield of black oats which is to be grown for hay? The oats are now about\r\nfour inches high and rank, as the land was pastured last year. The land\r\nis sandy, rolling soil and will soon be dry enough so that the cows\r\nwould not injure the plants. The idea is that the leaves which are green\r\nnow will all dry up and are really not the growth which is cut for hay;\r\ntherefore, I should think it would do no harm to feed it down a bit.\r\n\r\nOver-rank grain with abundant moisture will make a more stocky growth\r\nand stand against lodging if pastured or mowed. The leaves which you\r\nspeak of as being lost in the later growth of the plant serve an\r\nimportant purpose in making that growth, and removing them is a\r\nrepressive process which is not desirable when rain is short. We should\r\nallow the plants to push along into as good a growth of hay as a dry\r\nyear's moisture will give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Plowing for Grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have land that we could very easily plow now with our traction engine\r\nand improved plows, but the people here claim that it does not pay to\r\ndry-plow, that is, before the land has had a good rain on it and the\r\nvegetation has started. I believe in dry plowing. Two of our oldest\r\nfarmers in Merced county dry-plowed, that is, they commenced plowing as\r\nsoon as harvesting was over.\r\n\r\nIf the rainfall is small and likely to come in light showers, dry\r\nplowing, if it turns up the land in large clods, might yield poorer\r\nresults than land which is plowed after rain, because there would be so\r\nmuch moisture lost by drying out from the coarse surface when it came in\r\namounts not adequate for deep penetration. Plowing after the rain for\r\nthe purpose of killing out the foul stuff which starts is, however,\r\nquite another consideration. It is a fact that dry plowing and sowing is\r\nnot now desirable in some places where it was formerly accepted, because\r\nthe land has become so foul as to give a rank growth of weeds which\r\nchoke out the grain at its beginning. Such land can be cleaned by one or\r\ntwo shallow plowings and cultivations after there is moisture enough to\r\nstart the weeds to growing. These are local questions which you will\r\nhave to settle by observation. In a general way, it is true that opening\r\nthe surface of the ground before the rains, reduces the run-off and loss\r\nof moisture, but whether there would be any loss of moisture by run-off\r\nor not depends upon the slope of the land and also upon the way in which\r\nthe rain comes, and the total amount of moisture which is available for\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-varieties of California Barley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell where I can buy seed of varieties of California six-rowed\r\nbarley, described as \"pallidum\" and \"coerulescens,\" and what the seed\r\nwill cost?\r\n\r\nNo one knows where the six-rowed barley, known as \"common\" barley in\r\nthis State, came from, nor when it came. It has been here since the\r\nearly days and it has naturally shown a disposition to vary, so that it\r\nis quite possible to select a number of types from any large field, of\r\nit. These variations have been studied to some extent by Eastern\r\nstudents who are endeavoring to develop American types of barley for\r\nbrewing purposes as likely to be better than the brewing varieties which\r\nare famous in Europe. In Europe brewing barleys are chiefly two-rowed.\r\nUnder California conditions the plant is able to develop just as good\r\nbrewing grains on a six-rowed basis, and this seems to be a commendable\r\ntrait in the way of multiplying the product. The names \"pallidum\" and\r\n\"coerulescens\" indicate two of these varieties recognized by Eastern\r\nstudents. It is not possible at this time to get even a pound of\r\nselected grain true to this type, and no one knows when it will be\r\nworked out to available quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChevalier Barley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas Chevalier barley more value to feed hens for egg production than\r\ncommon feed barley or wheat?\r\n\r\nChevalier barley is no better for chicken feed than any other barley\r\nwhich is equally large and plump. Brewers like Chevalier because of its\r\nfullness of starch to support the malting process; also, because it is\r\nbright, that is, white, and not stained or tinged with bluish or reddish\r\ncolors. Color points do not count for chicken feed, but good plump\r\nkernels do. Besides this, however, darker kernel (not chaff) usually\r\nindicates more protein, and therefore a darker kernel of either wheat or\r\nbarley might be more valuable for feeding. A hard, horny kernel is\r\nricher than a softer, more starchy one, either in wheat or barley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley on Moist Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you do with land subject to overflow by the Sacramento when\r\nthat river rises 20 feet, and which you wanted to plant to barley this\r\nseason? Would you take a chance on the river rising that high this year,\r\nor wait until after that danger was over, and take a chance on not\r\ngetting enough rain to make the grain come up; also, if the river did\r\ncome up for 48 hours after the grain was in, but did not wash, would the\r\ngrain be lost? Should the grain be planted deeper than on ordinary land,\r\nand, if so, should a drill be used? How much seed should be sown per\r\nacre on good river-bottom soil?\r\n\r\nGet the barley in and watch for the overflow rather than to fear it. An\r\noverflow for 48 hours would give you the greatest crop you ever saw,\r\nunless it should be in a settling basin and the water forced to escape\r\nby evaporation. From your description we judge that this is not so and\r\nthat the land clears itself quickly from an overflow. Depth of sowing\r\ndepends upon the character and condition of the soil - the lighter and\r\ndrier the deeper. By all means use a drill if the soil is dry on the\r\nsurface. Short rainfall makes the advantage of drill seeding most\r\nconspicuous. On the University Farm 22 trials gave an average gain of\r\nover 10 per cent in yield. The difference would be much greater in a dry\r\nyear; it might be 25 per cent greater, possibly, and save high-priced\r\nseed at the same time, as about 90 pounds of seed per acre will do,\r\ninstead of 120 pounds broadcast, in accordance with the approved heavy\r\nseeding practice on the river lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley and Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some alfalfa which is a poor stand. Can I disc it up heavily and\r\nseed in some barley for winter pasture?\r\n\r\nYou can get barley into your alfalfa as you propose, but you should not\r\nseed until fall. The more barley you get into your alfalfa, however, the\r\nless alfalfa you will have afterward. If you want to improve your\r\nafalfa, keep everything else out of the field and help the plants by\r\nregular irrigations during the balance of the growing season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeets and Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best for dairy cows, plain red mangels or a cross between\r\nthese and sugar beets? Can you suggest a more profitable variety of\r\npotato than the Oregon Burbank?\r\n\r\nIf you can get a cross which gives you more tonnage than a mangel and a\r\nhigher nutritive content you would have something better to grow. The\r\nfirst point you have to determine by growing the two side by side and\r\nweighing the product; the nutritive value of each will have to be\r\ndetermined by chemical analysis. Until these determinations are actually\r\nmade a comparison of desirability is nothing but conjecture. There are\r\nseveral other potatoes which are sometimes more profitable here and\r\nthere for early crop when grown in an early locality. If you are not in\r\nan early locality you are obliged to produce for the main crop, and\r\nnothing, to our knowledge, sells as well as the Burbank, if you get a\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeets for Stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill sugar beets grow on black alkali land? How many pounds of seed per\r\nacre should be used and when is it time for sowing in the San Joaquin\r\nvalley? Which kind would be best for cows?\r\n\r\nBeets will do more on alkali than some other plants, but too much alkali\r\nwill knock them out. You must try and see whether you have too much\r\nalkali or not. You can sow at various times during the rainy season, for\r\nthe beets will stand some frost. Sow 8 pounds per acre in drills 2 1/2\r\nto 3 feet apart, so as to use a horse cultivator. For stock you had\r\nbetter grow large stock beets like marigolds or tankards - not sugar\r\nbeets. It costs too much to get sugar beets out of the ground, because\r\nit is their habit to grow small and bury themselves for the sake of the\r\nsugar maker, while stock beets grow largely above ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Start of Stock Beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I make Mangel Wurzels grow in hot weather? The land is level and\r\ncan be irrigated by flooding or ditching between the rows. How often\r\nshould the water be applied, and which method used? The land is in fine\r\nshape; a sandy loam bordering on to heavier land.\r\n\r\nWet the land thoroughly; plow and harrow and drill in the seed in rows\r\nabout 2 1/2 feet apart. This ought to give moisture enough to start the\r\nseed. Cultivate as soon as you can see the rows well. Irrigate in a\r\nfurrow between the rows about once a month; cultivate after each\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorn Growing for Silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith fair cultivation, will an acre produce about 10 tons of ensilage\r\nwithout fertilization - it being bottom land? How should it be planted?\r\n- the rows closer together than 3 feet, or should it be planted the\r\nusual width between rows, and thick in the rows? If fertilizers were to\r\nbe used, what kind would you recommend? Would you recommend deep plowing\r\nfollowed by a packer and harrow so as to preserve the moisture?\r\n\r\nYou ought to be able to get 10 tons of silage per acre from corn grown\r\non good corn land. It can be best grown in rows sufficiently distant for\r\ncultivation, closer in the row than would be desirable for corn, and yet\r\nnot too crowded, because corn for silage should develop good ears and\r\nshould be cut for silage about the time when the glazing begins to\r\nappear. If your land needs fertilization, stable manure or a \"complete\r\nfertilizer\" of the dealers would be the proper thing to use. It would be\r\nvery desirable to plow corn land deeply the preceding fall, followed by\r\na packer or harrow to settle down the land below, but do not work down\r\nfine. Keep the surface stirred from time to time during the winter and\r\nput in the crop with the usual cultivation in the spring as soon as the\r\nfrost danger is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigation for Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat amount of water is necessary per acre for the best possible yield\r\nof corn under acreage conditions and proper cultivation in the San\r\nJoaquin or Sacramento valleys?\r\n\r\nNo one can answer such a question with anything more than a guess. It\r\ndepends upon how much rain has fallen the previous winter, how retentive\r\nthe soil is naturally, and what has been done to help the soil to hold\r\nit. Nearly all the corn that is grown is carried without any irrigation\r\nat all on moist lowlands, which may be too wet for winter crops. If you\r\ndemand a guess, make it six acre-inches, with a good surface pulverizing\r\nafter each run of water in furrows between the rows. This water would be\r\nbest used in two or three applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Seed Corn for California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised as to Eastern-grown seed corn, comparing it\r\nwith California-grown seed. Some claim that the former does not yield\r\nwell the first season.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a complete refutation of the impression that Eastern seed\r\ncorn does not yield well the first season in California. It is a\r\nsomewhat prevalent impression. All that we can announce now is that we\r\nhave grown collections of Eastern seed corn and have found the product\r\nquite as good as could have been expected, and did not encounter,\r\napparently, the trouble of which you write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed of Corn Suckering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo insure the best crop of corn possible, does it pay to sucker it or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nThe removal of suckers is a matter of local conditions largely in\r\nCalifornia, and growers are getting out of the habit of suckering. In\r\nsome places suckering is needed, and in others it apparently does not\r\npay to do so, although with very rare exceptions a larger yield can be\r\nsecured by suckering than without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCow Peas Not Preparatory for Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat time of the year can cow peas be planted, and can the entire crop\r\nbe plowed under in time for planting field corn?\r\n\r\nCowpeas are very subject to frost. They are really beans, and therefore\r\ncan be grown in the winter time only in a few practically frostless\r\nplaces. Wherever frosts are likely to occur they must be planted, like\r\nbeans and corn, when the frost danger is over. Field peas, Canadian peas\r\nand vetches are hardy against frost and therefore safer for winter\r\ngrowth, and treated as you propose they may be preparatory for\r\ncorn-growing providing you plow them under soon enough to get a month or\r\nmore for decay before planting the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOats and Rust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any variety of oats that is rust-proof, or any method of\r\ntreating oats that will render them rust resistant? We are situated on a\r\nmountain, only about 12 miles from the coast, and have considerable\r\nfoggy weather, which most of the farmers here say is the cause of the\r\nrust.\r\n\r\nThere is no way of treating oats which will prevent smut, if the variety\r\nis liable to it. There is a great difference in the resistance of\r\ndifferent varieties. A few dark-colored oats are practically rust-proof,\r\nand you can get seed of them from the seedsmen in San Francisco and Los\r\nAngeles. Such varieties are chiefly grown on the southern coast. Foggy\r\nweather has much to do with the rust, because it causes atmospheric\r\nmoisture which is favorable to the growth of the fungus, which is\r\nusually checked by dry heat, and yet there are atmospheric conditions\r\noccasionally which favor the rust even in the driest parts of the State.\r\nThe fog favors rust, but does not cause it. The cause is a fungus, long\r\nago thoroughly understood and named puccinia graminis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer Hay Sowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I sow oats or barley in July upon irrigated mesa land, with the\r\nobject of making hay in the fall? Which of the two would do the better\r\nin summer time? I have plenty of water.\r\n\r\nWe have never seen this done to advantage. If you desire to try it,\r\nirrigate thoroughly and plow and sow afterward. Use barley rather than\r\noats and irrigate when the plant shades the land well, if you get growth\r\nenough to warrant it. It will be easier to get the crop than to figure a\r\nprofit in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoose Hay by Measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many cubic feet should be allowed for a ton of alfalfa hay loaded on\r\na wagon from the shock? I must sell more or less in that way, as no\r\nscales are near enough to be used.\r\n\r\nIt is a proposition, as to the weight of loose hay, which could of\r\ncourse keep changing the higher you built the load on the wagon. It is\r\neasier to give figures on weight from a stack in which there has been\r\nsomething like uniform pressure for a time. In the case from a 30-day\r\nstack it is common to allow an eight-foot cube to a ton, etc. Perhaps\r\nyou can guess from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Cut Oat Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the best red oat hay should it be cut when in the \"milk,\"\r\n\"dough\" or nearly ripe!\r\n\r\nIt should be cut in the \"soft dough\" or, as some express it, \"between\r\nthe milk and the dough.\" This is probably as near an approach in words\r\nas can be made to that condition which loses neither by immaturity or by\r\nover-maturity from the point of view of hay which is to get as much as\r\ncan be in the head without losing nutritiveness in the straw. Of course\r\nthere are other conditions intruding sometimes, like the outbreak of\r\nrust or the premature ripening through drought. In such cases care must\r\nbe taken not to let the plant stand too long for the sake of reaching an\r\nideal condition in the head - which for lack of favorable growing\r\nconditions the plant may not be able to reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRye for Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the best time to cut rye for hay, and how should it best be\r\nhandled? Would it be well to cut it up and blow it into the barn, and\r\nwould it do all right for silage?\r\n\r\nRye makes poor hay on account of its woody stems and must be cut earlier\r\nthan other grains. After that it is handled as is other hay. Cutting it\r\nup would probably be more of a help than to other grain hay. It could be\r\nput into the silo, but would of course have to be cut pretty green and\r\nwould have to run through a cutter and blower. Putting it in whole would\r\nbe out of the question. In the silo, the fermentation would largely\r\novercome the woodiness of the stems. It would also as a silage balance\r\nup nicely with alfalfa, and the best way to do would be to mix it with\r\nalfalfa when putting it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRye in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich kind of rye is the hardiest, the best yielding, and the best hay\r\nvarieties in your State?\r\n\r\nRye is the least grown of all the cereals in California, and no\r\nattention has been paid to selection of varieties. That which is\r\nproduced is \"just rye,\" of some common variety which came to the State\r\nyears ago and still remains. No rye is grown for hay, as the toughness\r\nof the stem renders it undesirable for that purpose. There is a certain\r\namount of rye grown for winter feeding. This is grown in the foothills\r\nprincipally and it serves an excellent purpose, but it is fed off before\r\napproaching maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Old Seven-Headed Wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are sending you some heads of grain which was grown in this county.\r\nThe land was planted with an imported Australian wheat, which we believe\r\nthe smaller heads to be, but the wheat is about evenly mired with grain\r\nlike the large heads, which we think to be a species of barley.\r\n\r\nThe grain is an old, coarse, bearded wheat which is continually\r\nappearing in fields of ordinary grain and naturally excites interest\r\namong all to whom the variety is a novelty. It is the old seven-headed\r\nEgyptian wheat, which has never proved of any cultural value, because\r\nits manifolding of the head is of no advantage. It is better to have a\r\nstraight well-filled head than to have a branching head of this kind.\r\nThis matter has been fully demonstrated by experience during the last\r\nthirty or forty years, not only in this State, but in other States, for\r\nthe variety has a way of getting around the world, and seed has\r\nsometimes been sold at exorbitant prices to people who have been\r\npersuaded that it is of particular value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeltz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard of a Russian grain called \"Speltz\" or \"Emmer.\" Can I raise\r\nit successfully and, if so, what is the very best time of year to sow\r\nsome for the best crop obtainable? Can it be sown in the fall, say\r\nNovember? Would springtime be a better time to sow it on soil that is\r\nvery soft in winter?\r\n\r\nIf your land yields good crops of wheat or barley or oats, you have\r\nlittle to expect from speltz or emmer. This is a grain generally\r\nconsidered inferior to those just mentioned and advocated for conditions\r\nunder which the better known grains do not do well. It is hardy against\r\ndrought and frost, particularly the latter, and is, therefore, chiefly\r\ngrown in the extreme north of Europe. It may be sown in the fall or in\r\nthe spring in places where rains are late and carry the plant to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItalian Rye Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of grass is enclosed? Also the best method to eradicate it?\r\n\r\nThe grass is the Italian rye grass, or as it is sometimes called, the\r\nItalian variety of the perennial rye grass. It is proving a very\r\nsatisfactory grass in California for moderate drought resistance and for\r\nwinter growing, and a great deal of it is being sown for these purposes.\r\nYou can readily kill it out by cultivation, but most people are more\r\noccupied with its propagation than with its destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFall Feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I irrigate and plant a forage crop n July to feed dairy cows this\r\nfall and winter? Would you recommend cow peas or some kind of sugar\r\ncorn? If cow peas, how many pounds to the acre?\r\n\r\nIf you wet down the land thoroughly and then plow and harrow and plant\r\neither cow peas or Indian corn, you ought to get a good green crop\r\nbefore frost. Drill in or drop the seed in rows about three feet apart\r\nand keep cultivating and irrigating as long as you can get through\r\nwithout injuring the crop too much. Use about 40 pounds of cow peas to\r\nthe acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHurry-up Pasture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I plant this fall which would produce pasturage for a small\r\namount of stock this winter, and until I can get the land under\r\nirrigation and seeded to alfalfa?\r\n\r\nFor quick fall and winter growth nothing is better probably than oats\r\nand vetches sown together as soon as you get rain enough to plow, but it\r\nwould be a question whether it is worth while to work for that, because\r\nyou ought to get your land ready for February sowing of alfalfa and that\r\nwill keep the land busy after the rain gets it into working condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am informed that Johnson grass makes fine hay. I have not sown the\r\nseed yet, but would like to know if the hay is good and if it will grow\r\non dry land. I have the seed on hand, but do not want to sow it if it is\r\nnot good.\r\n\r\nJohnson grass is poor, coarse stuff. The plant is most valuable for\r\ngrazing when young. Johnson grass will not grow on really dry land, but\r\nit will take the best moist land it can find and hold on to it. It is\r\nsensitive to frost and is not a winter grower except in the absence of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving Heavy Land for Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy land is very heavy, red loam, and crusts over very hard in dry\r\nseasons. I would like to know if it would be best to use barnyard\r\ncompost over the surface as a mulch, or would it be best to use plain\r\nstraw for that purpose?\r\n\r\nA very heavy soil can be brought into better surface condition for\r\nalfalfa by plowing in stable manure as soon as possible after the fall\r\nrains, in order that the manure may have opportunity to become\r\ndisintegrated and mixed with the soil by the time for alfalfa sowing,\r\nwhich is from February to April - whenever the heavy frosts of the\r\nlocality are over. For a small piece, you might get a better stand by\r\nusing a light mulch of disintegrated coarse manure or even straw,\r\nscattering it after the sowing, but for a large acreage this would\r\ninvolve too much labor. It is not desirable to work in much manure or\r\nother coarse stuff at the time of sowing the seed, but you can make a\r\nlight surface application after the plant has made a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCultivating Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the best time to cultivate alfalfa, and how often during the\r\nseason is it advantageous to do so? Which is the best implement to use?\r\n\r\nCultivated alfalfa is a term applied to alfalfa sown in rows and allowed\r\nto grow in narrow bands with cultivated land between, and the irrigation\r\nis then done in a furrow in the narrow cultivated strip. This will give\r\nthriftier growth and perhaps more hay to the acre than flooded,\r\nbroad-casted alfalfa, but it will cost so much more that the acre profit\r\nwould probably be less. This is an intensive culture of alfalfa, which\r\nis still to be tested out in California, if any one should be inclined\r\nto do it. Some one-cow suburbanite would be in condition to try the\r\nscheme first. Probably you refer to disking, and for that an ordinary\r\ndisk is used with the disks set pretty straight to reduce the side\r\ncutting, and this is done at different times of the year by different\r\ngrowers. By doing it when the ground gets dry in the early spring much\r\nof the foul stuff is cut out before the alfalfa starts strongly. But\r\ndisking seems to be good whenever in the year the soil is dry enough to\r\ntake it well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuburban Alfalfa Patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can we rid the alfalfa of weeds? As we are obliged to hire help, and\r\ndo not succeed in getting the hay cared for until we have mostly stalks\r\nwithout leaves, I have put the cow on it to pasture it off.\r\n\r\nThe cow knows how to handle it, but you will not get as much alfalfa as\r\nif you cut and carried it to her. If you cut sooner you will get rid of\r\nmany plants which are propagated by the seeds which they produce, and\r\nyou will also get better hay, more leaves and fewer stalks. Cut it about\r\nthe time it begins to bloom, not waiting for the full bloom to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Bermuda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land which was seeded to alfalfa some 15 years ago and has been\r\npastured continuously until it was almost all Bermuda. I had it\r\nthoroughly plowed, disk harrowed and sowed to oats; disk harrowed in,\r\nand drag harrowed. After cutting for hay this year I intend putting it\r\nin Egyptian corn in rows, so it can be cultivated to get rid of Bermuda.\r\nI have also been advised to plow the land immediately after harvesting\r\ncorn and let it lie until next January and then plow and sow to barley\r\nand alfalfa as I wish to grow alfalfa. Kindly let me know if method is\r\nright. The land is sandy loam and under irrigation.\r\n\r\nWhether you will fully succeed against Bermuda grass or not is doubtful.\r\nIt is probable, however, that you can reduce the Bermuda so that other\r\ncultivated crops can be continuously grown. Common experience is that\r\nBermuda will hold on unless you have hard freezing of the ground to a\r\nconsiderable depth, as they have in the northern States. The best use\r\nthat you can make of land infested with Bermuda is to get as good a\r\nstand as you can of alfalfa and let the alfalfa fight for itself. The\r\ncombination of alfalfa and Bermuda grass makes very good hay or\r\npasturage. We should, however, sow the alfalfa alone and not handicap it\r\nby sowing with barley. The Bermuda will smile at that advice. Egyptian\r\ncorn can be planted in rows, 2 1/2 to 3 feet between the rows to admit\r\nof easy cultivation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBermuda Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the value of Bermuda grass as a forage crop for cattle, more\r\nparticularly dairy cows?\r\n\r\nBermuda grass is generally condemned because of getting in places where\r\nit is not desirable and of being almost impossible of eradication\r\ntherefrom. Still, Bermuda grass will make good pasturage on land which\r\nis too alkaline to make other crops, and therefore is highly esteemed by\r\nsome owners of waste lands in the San Joaquin valley. It is good\r\npasturage and is most easily propagated by cutting the roots up into\r\nshort pieces by use of the hay-cutter, nearly all the pieces retaining\r\nan eye which will make a new plant. It is easy to get in and hard to get\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalt Grass and Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some land in Sutter county and it has some of this salt grass in\r\nspots. I am about to take a twenty-acre piece and put in alfalfa, but\r\nsome old-timers tell me that the salt grass on it is bad stuff to\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nYour trouble will probably be not so much the salt grass, but the alkali\r\nin the soil which the salt grass can tolerate and which other plants\r\ncannot stand. You cannot then substitute alfalfa for salt grass without\r\ngetting the alkali out of the soil, and you cannot do this without\r\nhaving sufficient drainage so that the rainfall may wash the alkali out\r\nfrom the soil and carry it away in the drainage water. You probably\r\ncannot get a satisfactory growth of alfalfa on the spots where the salt\r\ngrass has established itself, although the land round about may be very\r\nsatisfactory to alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiant Spurry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like information about spurry. How much frost will it stand?\r\nWhat is time for sowing? Its value as crop to plow under?\r\n\r\nFrom a California point of view, spurry is a winter-growing weed which\r\nhas been approved by orchardists in Sonoma county because it yields a\r\nconsiderable amount of vegetation for turning under with the spring\r\nplowing of the orchard. For this purpose it should be sown at the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season. Its value as a crop to turn under depends\r\nupon the amount of growth you can get. It is not a legume and,\r\ntherefore, does not have the value of the nitrogen-gathering plant.\r\nStill, it yields humus and, therefore, is valuable for winter growing as\r\nordinary weeds, grasses, grains, etc., are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLight Soil and Scant Moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvise me as to plowing under a crop of last year's weeds where I intend\r\nto plant beans, corn, etc. The soil is \"slickens,\" on the Yuba river,\r\nand the weeds grew up last year in a crop of volunteer barley, which was\r\nhogged off. I expect to plow five inches deep, and calculate that the\r\nbarley straw and weeds will contribute to the supply of humus, which is\r\nalways deficient in most of our soils. I expect to try to grow beans\r\nwithout irrigation, and wonder if the trash would hold the soil too open\r\nso as to dry them out.\r\n\r\nConsidering the character of the soil which you describe and the shallow\r\nplowing you intend we should certainly burn off all the trash upon the\r\nland. With deep plowing early in the season this coarse stuff could be\r\ncovered in to advantage, but it would be dangerous to do it in the\r\nspring. Clean land and thorough cultivation to save moisture enough for\r\nsummer's growth is the only rational spring treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClovers and Drought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have sandy loam with some alkali. In wet years it is regarded as too\r\ndamp in some places. Can you give me any information on the following\r\npoints? I have practically no water for irrigation and I feel sure that\r\nalfalfa would not grow without it. Do you think that clover would make\r\none or more cuttings without water?\r\n\r\nRed and white clover are less tolerant of drought than alfalfa, which,\r\nbeing a deep-rooting plant, is especially commended in dry-farming\r\nundertakings. Red clover will grow better on low wet lands than will\r\nalfalfa, but the land must not dry out or the red clover will die during\r\nthe dry season. None of the plants will stand much alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClover for Wet Lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of alfalfa will do best on sub-irrigated land which is very\r\nwet? I have sown it in alfalfa and it grows finely for two or three\r\nyears, but then the roots rot and die.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make any kind of alfalfa grow well on very wet land,\r\nthat is, where the water comes too near the surface. Alfalfa has a\r\ndeep-running tap root which is very subject to standing water. You can\r\nget very good results from the Eastern red clover on such land, because\r\nthe red clover has a fibrous root which is content to live in a shallow\r\nlayer of soil above water. But red clover will not stand drought as well\r\nas alfalfa, because it is shallower rooting. It is necessary, therefore,\r\nthat water should be permanently near the surface or surface irrigation\r\nbe frequently applied, in order to secure satisfactory growth of red\r\nclover in the drier sections of California. It is also necessary that\r\nneither land nor water carry alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrosted Grain for Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe freeze struck us pretty severely. I had 125 acres of summer-fallowed\r\nwheat which I had estimated to make 20 sacks to the acre of grain. It\r\nwas breast high in places already, and was just heading out. The frost\r\npinched the stalks of this grain in several places and the heads are now\r\nturning white. It is ruined for grain. There is lots of fodder in it,\r\nand it should be made into hay. If so, should it not be cut and cured at\r\nonce? What is the relative worth of such hay as compared with more\r\nmatured hay? Would the fact that it is frozen make it injurious to feed?\r\n\r\nIf the whole plant seems to be getting white, the sooner it is cut the\r\nbetter. If the head is affected and the leaf growth continued, cutting\r\nmight be deferred for the purpose of getting more of it. Hay made from\r\nsuch material will not be in any way dangerous, although it would be\r\ninferior as containing less nutritive and more non-nutritive matter.\r\nSuch hay would seem to be most serviceable as roughage for cows or\r\nsteers in connection with alfalfa hay or some other feed which would\r\nsupply this deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForage Plants in the Foothills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have 3,000 acres of foothill land and hope to be able to irrigate\r\nsome land this spring and wish to know the best forage crops, for sheep\r\nand hogs, especially. Kafir corn, stock peas, rape, sugar-beets and\r\nartichokes are the varieties about which we desire information.\r\n\r\nWhere you have irrigation water available in the foothills you can get a\r\nvery satisfactory growth of red clover. We have seen it doing very well\r\non sloping land in your county where water was allowed to spill over\r\nfrom a ditch on the ridge to moisten the slope below. Winter rye and\r\nother hardy stock feeds could also be grown in the winter time on the\r\nprotected slopes with the rainfall. Some such plants are not good summer\r\ngrowers, owing to the drought. Rape is a good winter grower by rainfall,\r\nbut not so satisfactory as vetches and kale. Sugar beets are not so good\r\nfor stock purposes as stock beets, which give you much more growth for\r\nthe same labor and are more easily gathered because they grow a good\r\npart out of the ground. They will stand considerable freezing and may be\r\nsown at different times throughout the year, whenever the land is moist,\r\neither by irrigation or rainfall. Artichokes are of doubtful value. We\r\nhave never found anyone who continued to grow them long. Of course, on\r\ngood, deep land, with irrigation, nothing can be better than alfalfa as\r\nsupplementary to hill range during the summer season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Forage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what time of the year should I plant kale, Swiss chard, etc., so as\r\nto have them ready for use during the months from February to June?\r\n\r\nYou should plant Swiss chard, kale, etc., as soon as the ground is\r\nsufficiently moist from the rain in the fall. In fact, it would be\r\ndesirable for you to plant the seed earlier in boxes and thus secure\r\nplants for planting out when the ground is sufficiently moist. These\r\nplants are quite hardy against frost, and in order to have them\r\navailable by February, a start in the autumn is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Summer Hay Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I put on the land after the oat crop is taken off to furnish\r\nhay for horses during the coming winter? I had thought millet would be\r\ngood. I have water for irrigation.\r\n\r\nYou could get most out of the land you mention during the hot season by\r\ngrowing Kafir corn or milo, cutting for hay before the plant gets too\r\nfar advanced. If your land can be flooded and takes water well, so that\r\nyou can wet it deeply before plowing, the sorghum seed can be broadcast\r\nand the crop cut with the mower while the stalks are not more than half\r\nan inch in diameter. This makes a good coarse hay. If you have not water\r\nenough or the land does not lie right for flooding, you can grow the\r\nsorghum in drills and irrigate by the furrow method, being careful,\r\nhowever, not to let the crop go too far if you desire to feed it as hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeosinte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about \"Teosinte,\" its food value, method of culture, and\r\nadaptability to our climate, character of soil required?\r\n\r\nTeosinte is a corn-like plant of much lower growth than Indian corn. It\r\nmay be of value as a forage plant on low, moist, interior lands in the\r\nsummer season. It is very sensitive to frost and is, therefore, not a\r\nwinter grower. It abhors drought and, therefore, is not a plant for\r\nplains or hillsides. It was grown to some extent in California 25 years\r\nago and abandoned as worthless so far as tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBermuda Objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBermuda grass as pasture for summer to supplement burr clover and\r\nalfilaria in winter on the cheap hill pasture lands along the coast or\r\nthe foothill ranges of the Sierras. Stock like it and do well on it, and\r\nI have noticed it growing in places where it had no water but the little\r\nrains of winter in southern California. So the question occurred to me,\r\nwhy should it not be a profitable pasture for the dry summers on the\r\ncoast or foothill ranges of the State?\r\n\r\nBermuda grass will not make summer growth enough on dry pasture land to\r\nmake it worth having. It will not make much growth in the rainy season\r\nbecause of frost, and if it has possession of the ground it will not\r\nallow either burr clover or alfilaria to make such winter growth as they\r\nwill on clean land. Besides, this grass is generally counted a nuisance,\r\nbecause it will get into all the good cultivated land and it is almost\r\nimpossible of eradication. Bermuda grass is of some account on alkali\r\nland where it finds moisture enough for free growth. We would not plant\r\nit in any other situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRye Grasses Better than Brome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI see in an Eastern seed catalogue \"Bromus Inermis\" very highly spoken\r\nof as pasturage. Do you know anything of it, and do you think it would\r\nbe suitable for reclaimed tule land in the bay section?\r\n\r\nBoth English and Italian rye grasses have proved better than Bromus\r\nInermis on such land as you mention. The latter is commonly known as\r\nHungarian brome grass or awniess brome grass and it was introduced to\r\nthis State from Europe about 25 years ago and the seed distributed by\r\nthe University Experiment Station. Hungarian brome may be better on\r\nrather dry lands, although it will not live through the summer on very\r\ndry lands in this State, but we would rather trust the rye grasses or\r\nreclaimed lands, providing, of course, that they are sufficiently free\r\nfrom salt to carry tame grass at all. On the upper coast Hungarian brome\r\nhas been favorably reported as an early-winter growing grass with\r\ncomparatively low nutritive value, but is especially valuable because it\r\nwill grow in poor soil. It is especially suited to sandy pasture and\r\nmeadow lands and is quite resistant to drought. It is a perennial grass,\r\nreproducing by a stout rootstock, which makes it somewhat difficult to\r\neradicate when it is not desired. It is desirable to keep stock off the\r\nfields during the first year to get a good stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Medic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you kindly name the enclosed; also explain its value as forage!\r\n\r\nThe plant is black medic. It has been very widely distributed over the\r\nState during the last few years. It is sometimes called a new burr\r\nclover, which it somewhat resembles. It is not very freely eaten by\r\nstock and is apparently inferior to burr clover for forage purposes. It\r\nis a good plant to plow under for green manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson Clover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout crimson clover in California. Has it proved satisfactory? If so,\r\ncan you give me data how to plant, etc.!\r\n\r\nCrimson clover must be sown after frost, for it is tender. It will give\r\na great show in June and July on low moist land. It is not good against\r\neither frost or drought. It has been amply tried in California and\r\nproved on the whole of little account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia Winter Pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a great deal of pasture land on which the native grasses yield\r\nless feed each year. A great part of this land can be cleared of brush\r\nand stone, ready for the plow, but what can we sow to take the place of\r\nthe native pasture? The ground in many places is not level enough for\r\nalfalfa and in some places water is not available. Can we break up the\r\nland and sow pasture grasses as the farmers are exhorted to do at the\r\nEast? The annual rainfall is from 12 to 15 inches.\r\n\r\nThe perennial grasses which they rely upon for pasturage in the East and\r\nwhich will maintain themselves from year to year, will not live at all\r\non the dry lands of California, nor has investigation of the last\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years found anything better for these California\r\nuplands than the winter growth of plants which are native to them. Such\r\nlands should be better treated, first by not being overstocked; second,\r\nby taking off cattle at the time the native plant needs to make seed,\r\nbecause, as they are not perennial, they are dependent upon each year's\r\nseed. After the plants have seeded, the land can be pastured for dry\r\nfeed without losing the seed.\r\n\r\nOf course, if one has land capable of irrigation he can grow forage\r\nplants, even the grasses which grow in moist climates, like the rye\r\ngrasses, the brome grasses and the oat grasses, etc., which will do well\r\nif given a little moisture, but it will be a loss of money to break up\r\nthe dryer lands with the idea of establishing perennial grasses upon\r\nthem without irrigation. California pastures are naturally good. In\r\nearly days they were wonderful, but they are restricted to growth during\r\nthe rainy season, or for a little time after that, and are therefore\r\nsuited for winter and spring pasturage, while the summer feeding of\r\nstock, aside from dry feed, should be provided from other lands where\r\nwater can be used. The improvement of these wild pastures consists in a\r\nmore intelligent policy for their production and preservation rather\r\nthan an effort to improve them by the introduction of new plants.\r\nPastures may, however, be often improved by clearing off the brush and\r\nharrowing in seed of burr clover, alfilaria, etc., at the beginning of\r\nthe rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfilaria and Winter Pasturage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill alfilaria (Erodium cicutarium) grow well on the hills of Sonoma\r\ncounty partially covered with shrubs? I want something that will be food\r\nfor stock another year. I have heard of alfilaria and that it grows well\r\nwithout being irrigated.\r\n\r\nAlfilaria is a good winter-growing forage plant in places where it\r\naccepts the situation. It is an annual and therefore does not make\r\npermanent pasturage except where it may re-seed itself. On the coming of\r\nthe dry season it will speedily form seed and disappear. It is therefore\r\nof no summer use under the conditions which you describe, nor is it\r\npossible to secure any perennial grass which will be satisfactory on dry\r\nhillsides without irrigation. Improved winter pasturage can be secured\r\nby scattering seed of common rye at the beginning of the rainy season,\r\nor of burr clover, both of which are winter-growing plants. Pasturage is\r\nalso capable of improvement by being careful not to overstock the land,\r\nso that the native annuals may be able to produce seed and provide for\r\ntheir own succession. The secret of successful pasturage on dry uplands\r\nis to improve the winter growth. It is too much to expect much of them\r\nfor summer growth without irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasses for Bank-Holding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe desire a grass to be used on levees, to keep from washing. Bermuda or\r\nJohnson gross are dangerous to farming lands. What we desire is a grass\r\nthat will grow in good dirt with no water to support it during most of\r\nthe year, except the annual rainfall of Fresno county. Of course, this\r\ngrass will also have to endure a great deal of water during the flooded\r\nseason of the year. We have heard that the Italian rye grass would be\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\nThe rye grasses do not have running roots; therefore are not calculated\r\nto bind soil particles together as Bermuda grass does. If you want a\r\nbinding grass, you must take the chances of its spreading to adjacent\r\nlands. Of course, if you could get a sod of rye grass it would prevent\r\nsurface washing from overflow, etc., to a certain extent. We are not\r\nsure how far it would prevent bank cutting by the flowing water, for it\r\nmakes a bunchy and not a sod-like growth. It would not live through the\r\nsummer unless the levee soil keeps somewhat moist. The only way to\r\ndetermine whether you can get a permanent growth of it, will be by\r\nmaking a trial. Seed should be sown as soon as the ground becomes\r\nmoistened by rain. It is a very safe proposition, because if it is\r\nwilling to live through the summer, it is one of the best pasturage\r\ngrasses for places in California where it will consent to grow, and it\r\nis not liable to become an annoyance by taking possession of adjacent\r\nland, because it would be readily killed by cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sowed several acres of alfalfa seed with a disc this season and none\r\nof it has come up. I think the reason for it not coming up is that the\r\ndisc put it into the ground too deep. We sowed some by hand and it came\r\nup very well. Is there any probability that later in the season this\r\nseed will germinate, or has it rotted in the ground? Water stands within\r\nthree feet of the surface and has considerable alkali. What can I plant\r\non this land and get a crop? It is our intention to sow it to alfalfa\r\nnext fall. The land adjoining, although higher, has a good stand of\r\nalfalfa now.\r\n\r\nYou are right about covering the alfalfa seed too deeply. It is not\r\nlikely to appear. Your chance of getting a durable stand of alfalfa on\r\nsuch shallow soil over alkali water is not good, but you can hardly\r\ndetermine that without trying. Sometimes conditions are better than you\r\nthink; sometimes worse. The plant itself is the best judge. On your\r\nlower land you could probably get a better stand of rye grass than\r\nanything else - sowing at the beginning of the rainy season. Of course,\r\nhowever, even that will depend upon how much alkali you have to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa on Adobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs adobe land good for alfalfa? Is it harder to start than in other\r\nsoils or not? How much seed is required to sow an acre? Also state what\r\ntime alfalfa should be sowed.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will thrive on an adobe soil if the moisture is kept right -\r\nespecially guarding against too much water at a time. It is necessary to\r\nirrigate more frequently and apply only as much as can be absorbed by\r\nthe soil before the hot sun comes on the field, for that scalds the\r\nplant badly. It is harder to get a good stand because of the cracking\r\nand hardening of the surface. Sow about 20 pounds to the acre just as\r\nsoon as the soil comes into good condition - that is, moist and warm.\r\nFebruary and March are usually the best months, according to the season\r\nin the interior valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Soil Depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you consider soil which is from 4 to 6 feet deep to hardpan of\r\nsufficient depth for alfalfa? Is there hardpan in the region of Lathrop\r\nin San Joaquin county, and can it be dissolved by irrigation, or can any\r\ngood be accomplished by blowing holes at different places to allow the\r\nwater to pass to lower levels? Are other crops affected by hardpan being\r\nso close to the surface?\r\n\r\nYou can grow alfalfa successfully on land which is from four to six feet\r\ndeep if you irrigate rather more frequently and use less amounts of\r\nwater each time, so that the plant shall be adequately supplied and yet\r\nnot forced to carry its roots in standing water. The Eastern alfalfa\r\ngrower is fortunate when he gets half the depth you mention, although it\r\ndoes seem rather shallow in California. Shallow lands are distributed\r\nover the valley quite widely. A deepening of the available soil is\r\nusually accomplished by dynamiting, especially so if the hardpan is\r\nunderlaid by permanent strata. Alfalfa will penetrate some kinds and\r\nthicknesses of hardpan when it is kept moist, but not too wet, to\r\nencourage root growth.\r\n\r\nWinter-growing green crops are less affected by shallow soil because\r\nthey generally make their growth while the moisture is ample, if the\r\nseason is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCuring Alfalfa with Artificial Heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is current rumor that \"out in California they are hauling alfalfa\r\ngreen and curing it by artificial heat,\" thus reducing loss through bad\r\nweather and producing a superior hay for feeding or milling purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is true that alfalfa is being cut green and dried by artificial heat,\r\nbut this is only being done in preparation for grinding. No one thinks\r\nof doing it for the making of hay for storage or for feeding. This\r\nmethod is undertaken, not because the alfalfa hay does not dry quickly\r\nenough in the field, but because after drying in the field so many\r\nleaves are lost in hauling to the mill. We have no trouble sun-drying\r\nalfalfa for ordinary hay purposes; in fact, we have to be very careful\r\nthat it does not get too dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheap Preparation of Land for Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am about to put a piece of land into alfalfa, and want to use the most\r\neconomical system of preparing the land for irrigation. My neighbors\r\ntell me that it will be necessary for me to have the land leveled; at a\r\ncost of $6 to $10 per acre. Now I am informed that in Alberta, and some\r\nplaces in California, they do not go to the expense of leveling land,\r\nbut use a system of preparing land for irrigation at a cost of about 60\r\ncents per acre.\r\n\r\nNothing except a highly educated gale of wind, with discriminating\r\ncutting and filling ability of a very high order, could do it for that\r\nprice. The cheapest way to prepare land for irrigation is the contour\r\ncheck method, which is largely used, or the flooding in strips between\r\nlevees at right angles to the supply ditch; but neither of these could\r\nbe put in properly for that money, even if the land was naturally in\r\nsuch shape that a minimum amount of soil-shifting is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Alfalfa is Grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what counties is alfalfa most successfully grown? By this I mean\r\nwhere three crops of hay may be had each growing season. Also, will corn\r\ngrow good paying crops in same sections?\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is grown all through the valleys and foothills of interior\r\nCalifornia; also to a certain extent in coast valleys. On suitable\r\nlands, three crops can sometimes be secured without irrigation, while\r\ntwice or three times as many cuttings are secured on irrigated lands\r\nwhere the frost-free season is particularly long. According to the last\r\ncensus, we are growing alfalfa on 19,104 farms with a total acreage of\r\n484,098. The total value of the product is over $13,000,000. Corn is\r\nwidely grown, but is small as compared with alfalfa. It is grown in\r\nalfalfa districts and in coast valleys where there is not much done with\r\nalfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSowing Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper time to sow alfalfa? Some advocate fall and others\r\nspring sowing. What seasons are given for each sowing?\r\n\r\nWe shall undoubtedly soon get to sowing alfalfa all the year round\r\nexcept in the short season of sharp frosts and cold wet ground in\r\nNovember, December and January. If you can get a good start in September\r\nand October, all right; if not, wait until February and March, according\r\nto the season. Where it is never very cold or wet, sow whenever moisture\r\nis right. There never can be any rule about it, for localities will\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoxtail and Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill foxtail choke out and exterminate alfalfa? Some fields look as\r\nthough the foxtail had crowded the alfalfa out, but I hold that the\r\nalfalfa died from some other cause and the foxtail merely took its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFoxtail will not choke out alfalfa, providing, soil and moisture\r\nconditions are right for the latter, and a good stand of plant has been\r\nsecured. If anything is wrong with the alfalfa, the foxtail will be on\r\nthe alert to take advantage of it. You will always have foxtail with\r\nyou, and considerable quantities of it, perhaps, in the first cutting,\r\nbecause foxtail will grow at a lower temperature than alfalfa, and,\r\ntherefore, will keep very busy during the rainy season, while the\r\nalfalfa is more or less dormant, but as the heat increases, if the soil\r\nis good and moisture ample, the alfalfa will put the foxtail out of\r\nsight until the following winter invites it to make another aggressive\r\ngrowth. Therefore, we answer that alfalfa does not die from foxtail, but\r\nfrom some condition unfavorable to the alfalfa, which must be sought in\r\nthe soil, or in the moisture supply, or traced back to bad seed, and a\r\npoor stand at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich Alfalfa is Best?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have in Stanislaus county ten acres of Arabian alfalfa, which was sown\r\nthe first week in April this year. It was clipped in July and irrigated.\r\nIt is now about 14 inches high, but looks sickly, turns white at the\r\ntips, and some dies down. There are several places here with the Arabian\r\nalfalfa on them and with the same trouble, while the ordinary variety is\r\nlooking fine by the side of it.\r\n\r\nArabian alfalfa usually makes a good show at first and begins to run out\r\nafterward. It does not seem to be so long-lived and satisfactory as the\r\ncommon variety. With this prospect ahead of you, according to present\r\nexperience, it would seem to be desirable to plow the crop in and seed\r\nagain with the common variety, or with the Turkestan, which is proving\r\nthe most satisfactory of the recently introduced varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFall Sowing of Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have summer-fallowed land which we know will grow good alfalfa, and\r\nas we have just had four inches of rainfall upon it, we were wondering\r\nif we could not plow the twenty acres and get a stand upon it in time to\r\nstand the cold weather this winter. Do you think this is practicable?\r\n\r\nIf four inches of rain on summer fallow connects well with the lower\r\nmoisture which a good summer fallow ought to conserve in the soil, such\r\nsowing is rational; but if the summer fallowing was not done well, that\r\nis, if it was rough plowing without enough harrowing, as is too often\r\nthe case, the four inches of rain might not be safe because of the dry\r\nground beneath waiting to seize the moisture and so dry the surface that\r\nsprouting alfalfa plants would perish between dry soil below and dry\r\nwind above. Fall sowing will give enough growth to resist frost killing\r\nin many places in the valley if the moisture in the soil is enough to\r\ncarry the plant as well as start it, or if showers come frequently -\r\notherwise it is dangerous, not from frost but from drouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Hay and Soil Fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are feeding all our hay to dairy cows, returning the manure to the\r\nsoil. At present prices of hay, my neighbors who sell theirs, seem to be\r\nas well off, with considerable less work; but how about the future? Can\r\nthis soil be cropped indefinitely and the crops sold, without returning\r\nanything to the land?\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to think that you can sell alfalfa hay indefinitely\r\nwithout reducing the soil. It may gain in nitrogen by the wastes of the\r\nplant, but it will lose in other constituents unless reinforced by\r\nfertilization. No single act can make for the maintenance of the soil as\r\nthe growing and feeding of crops and return of manure does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry-Land Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am in a country of strictly dry farming. I have a wash or gulch on my\r\nplace and would like to know if  I could, with success, plant it to\r\nalfalfa without irrigation; soil is sandy loam, no evidences of springy\r\nmoisture at all. What kind should I try?\r\n\r\nAlfalfa will endure much drouth. What it will do in a particular place\r\ncan only be told by trying. Sow Turkestan alfalfa. If the rains come\r\nearly so as to wet the land down in September and October, sow the seed\r\nthen. The endurance of the plant will depend much upon its having a\r\nchance to root deeply before the drouth comes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInoculating Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it profitable to inoculate alfalfa seed before planting to increase\r\nits yield? Can it be done by leaching soil from old alfalfa ground,\r\nproviding it has been plowed up and allowed to stand for a year? Are\r\ncommercial inoculants a safe thing to inoculate with?\r\n\r\nApparently alfalfa does not need inoculation in this State. Probably not\r\none acre in ten thousand now profitably growing alfalfa has ever had\r\nartificial introduction of germs. You can make germ-tea, if you wish, of\r\nthe soil you describe; one year's exposure would not destroy the germs.\r\nIt is safe enough to use commercial cultures. You will have to decide\r\nfor yourself whether it is worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am making parallel ridges for alfalfa, sending a full head of water\r\ndown to the end of the field between each ridge. Should I calculate the\r\nlands to be mowed one at a time in even swaths? The mower being 5-foot\r\ncut, would you count on cutting a 4 1/2 or 5-foot swath? This soil is\r\nsandy, water percolating rapidly. The fall is 8 feet to the mile. How\r\nwide, then, would you advise making the ridges to suit the mower, and to\r\nflood economically, using from 2 to 4 cubic feet per second? The length\r\nof the lands is across 40 acres.\r\n\r\nGrowing alfalfa in long parallel checks, to be flooded between the\r\nlevees, is the way in which much alfalfa is being put in at the present\r\ntime where the land has such a slope as you indicate. It is calculated,\r\nhowever, to seed the levees as well as the check bottoms, and to run the\r\nmowers across the levees, thus leaving no waste land and mowing across\r\nthe whole field and not between the levees as you propose. For that\r\npurpose these levees are made low, not over a foot in height,\r\ncalculating that they will settle to about six or eight inches, which is\r\nsufficient to hold the water and direct its flow gently down the slope.\r\nThere is, however, a limit to the distance over which water can be\r\nevenly distributed in this way, the difference being dependent upon the\r\ncharacter of the soil, slope, etc. A length of nine hundred feet is\r\nsometimes found too great for an even distribution, and, for this\r\nreason, supply ditches at shorter intervals are introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnirrigated Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what part of the State does alfalfa grow best without irrigation?\r\n\r\nObviously the parts which have the greatest rainfall in connection with\r\nretentive soil and plenty of summer heat. Alfalfa grows best without\r\nirrigation on \"sub-irrigated\" land where the ground water is\r\nsufficiently deep to allow a deep rooting of the plant in free soil and\r\nyet not too far down to be readily reached by the deep-running roots.\r\nGood results can be obtained with anywhere from four to ten or twelve\r\nfeet of soil above water. On shallower soils the plant is apt to be\r\nshort-lived through root troubles. Unirrigated alfalfa is also reduced\r\nby the incursions of gophers which flooding at least once a year will\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long can alfalfa stand water without being drowned out? I have a\r\npiece of alfalfa on which the water will stand for considerable time in\r\nthe winter time.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa while dormant will endure submergence for several weeks. We do\r\nnot know exactly how long, but evidently for a considerable period,\r\nproviding temperatures are too low to invite growth. On the other hand,\r\ngrowing alfalfa is quickly and seriously injured by overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Nurse-Crop for Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it advisable to use oats with alfalfa seeds in seeding for alfalfa?\r\nSome growers of alfalfa here advise it strongly, others advise against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe general experience in California is decidedly against using oats,\r\nbarley, or any other nursecrop with alfalfa. Get the land in the best\r\npossible condition and let the alfalfa have the full benefit of it. The\r\nripening of the grain crop will do the young alfalfa plants more harm by\r\nrobbing them of moisture than any protection which the taller plant can\r\nafford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReseeding Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis spring I planted alfalfa and only got about half a stand on some of\r\nthe land. I want to reseed this fall and I thought of putting more seed\r\non the ground and then disc it in. Or would you advise replanting the\r\nland? What do you think of putting manure on young alfalfa? Do you think\r\nthere is any danger of burning it out?\r\n\r\nStir it up with a spring tooth harrow or disc it lightly to make a nice\r\nseed bed and then sow your seed as if you were planting alfalfa for the\r\nfirst time. This will give you a good seed bed and will not hurt the\r\nalfalfa already growing. Prepare the surface first and then sow, rather\r\nthan disking in the seed. The manure in moderate application would not\r\nburn out the young alfalfa if properly applied after the rains begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the Bloat Out of Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Italian rye grass and red top clover be a success under irrigation\r\nas cow pasture in this county, either separately or mixed with alfalfa?\r\nTo sow in bare spots in the alfalfa, would the rye grass prevent bloat?\r\n\r\nItalian rye grass and red clover will make good pasturage under\r\nirrigation and will make a fight with the alfalfa to the best of their\r\nability. The admixture of rye grass will reduce the danger from\r\nbloating. Red clover will not have that effect, because red clover is a\r\npretty good bloater on its own account. This seems to be the function of\r\nall the clovers according to the rankness of their growth at the time\r\nthat they are grazed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time to Cut Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best period to cut alfalfa hay for cow feed and the best\r\nmethod for curing?\r\n\r\nThe best time to cut alfalfa is just when new shoots are starting out at\r\nthe crown. This will give the greatest yield of hay during a season, and\r\nthe hay will be much more palatable than if the alfalfa is permitted to\r\nget well into the blossoming period. The leaves, which are the best part\r\nof the hay, also remain on better than if the stems are older. If a\r\nperson does not care to take the trouble to find out whether the new\r\nshoots are coming out or not, he can approximate the time to cut fairly\r\nwell by waiting until a blossom here and there appears, cutting\r\nimmediately. It would be difficult to tell on paper exactly when alfalfa\r\nwas properly cured, as that is a matter of individual judgment. It is\r\nusual to cut in the morning and rake into windrows in the afternoon.\r\nWith the usual weather in interior California that stage of the curing\r\nis completed by that time. The next day it can be gathered into cocks\r\nand gotten ready to move. That is about all the curing that is done. The\r\nsize of the windrows depends upon the amount of hay, as thick hay should\r\nbe put up in small windrows to give plenty of circulation of air. It is\r\nconsidered better also to build the cocks on raked land, otherwise the\r\nhay lying flat at the bottom will not cure properly and cannot be\r\ngathered up clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich Crop of Alfalfa for Seed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich cutting of alfalfa should be left for seed bearing?\r\n\r\nWhich cutting is best for seed depends, of course, on the way the plant\r\ngrows in your locality. Where it starts early and gives many cuttings in\r\na season with irrigation a later growth should be chosen for seed than\r\nwith a short season where fewer cuttings can be had. The second cutting\r\nis best in many places, but O. E. Lambert of Modesto after threshing\r\nabout 30 lots in one year tells us that some growers had left second,\r\nsome third and some fourth cuttings for seed. He found the second\r\ncutting very poor both in yield and grade, much of it not being well\r\nfilled and the seed blighted, as the growth of hay was too heavy. The\r\nseed on third cutting was good both in grade and yield. Much of the seed\r\non fourth cutting was not matured. For good results the stand should be\r\nthin. Our drier, heavier lands give the best results, sub-irrigated\r\nlands not seeding. All irrigation should stop with the previous cutting\r\nfor hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiloing First Crop Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow about putting first cutting of alfalfa and foxtail into the silo? Do\r\nyou think there is any danger of fire in a wooden silo, and do you add\r\nsalt and water when filling, and how long after it is cut would you\r\nadvise putting it into the silo?\r\n\r\nPut it through the silo cutter as soon as you can get it from the field.\r\nDo not let it cure at all, and be sure to cut and pack well. If at all\r\ndry, use water at the time of filling, and some salt then also, if you\r\ndesire. There is no danger of firing if you put it in with good\r\nmoisture, and by short cutting and hard packing you exclude the air. If\r\nyou do not do this you will get a silo full of manure, and possibly have\r\na fire while it is rotting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil for Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of soil is best for alfalfa on a dairy ranch?\r\n\r\nAn ideal soil for alfalfa is a deep well drained soil into which the\r\nroots can run deeply without danger of encountering standing water or\r\nalkali. Still we are finding that alfalfa is very successful on soils\r\nwhich are not strictly ideal, providing the moisture is supplied in such\r\na way that the soil shall not be waterlogged nor the water be allowed to\r\nremain upon the surface during the hot weather, because this kills the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Young Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have alfalfa that is doing very well for the first year. My soil is\r\nsandy loam with light traces of white alkali, although it does not seem\r\nto be detrimental to the growth thus far. I am in the dairy business and\r\nwill have by winter enough manure to top-dress the field. Would it be\r\ngood policy to use the manure, or would it be more satisfactory to\r\ntop-dress with gypsum? Would it injure alfalfa to pasture lightly after\r\nthe last cutting?\r\n\r\nPresumably your soil contains enough lime, and therefore the application\r\nof gypsum at this time of the year would not be necessary. It may be\r\ndesirable to top-dress with gypsum near the end of the rainy season to\r\nstimulate the growth of the plant. Gypsum, however, has no effect upon\r\nwhite alkali. So far as alkali goes, gypsum merely changes black alkali\r\ninto white, thus making it less corrosive.\r\n\r\nThere would be no objection to pasturing lightly this fall. Be careful,\r\nhowever, to keep off the stock while the land is wet and not to\r\noverstock so as to injure root crowns by tramping. The manure can be\r\nused as a top dressing during the rainy season, unless you think it\r\nbetter to save it for the growth of other crops. Alfalfa is so deep\r\nrooting where conditions are favorable that it does not require\r\nfertilization usually on land which has been used for a long time for\r\ngrain or other shallow-rooting plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Sowing with Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI intend sowing alfalfa this fall on land that has some very compact\r\nhard spots. I aim to doctor these spots with gypsum at the rate of about\r\n1000 pounds per acre and cultivate the gypsum in thoroughly two or three\r\nweeks before sowing the alfalfa seed. Would this be all right? Is there\r\ndanger of injury to seed by coming in contact with gypsum?\r\n\r\nGypsum will not hurt the alfalfa seed. It is not corrosive like an\r\nalkali. Whether it will have time enough to ameliorate the soil in the\r\nspots in the period you mention depends upon there being moisture enough\r\npresent at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Clover for Shallow Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of red clover on shallow soils in the Sacramento valley\r\nunder irrigation? How many crops, etc.?\r\n\r\nRed clover is fine under the conditions you describe. We could never\r\nunderstand why people do not grow more of it on shallow land over\r\nhardpan which is free from alkali and not irrigated too much at a time.\r\nIt is good on shallow land over water, where alfalfa roots decay, etc.\r\nThough we have no exact figures, we should expect to get about\r\ntwo-thirds as much weight from it as from an equally good stand of\r\nalfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClovers for High Ground-Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere, in California, is alfalfa being raised successfully above a\r\nwater-table of, say, 4 feet or less, and are any unusual means used to\r\naccomplish this?\r\n\r\nOver a high water-table, the alfalfa plant will be shorter lived\r\naccording to the shallowness of soil above water. One could get very\r\ngood results at from 4 to 6 feet, whereas at 2 or 3 feet the stand of\r\nalfalfa would soon become scant through decay of its fleshy root. Where\r\nthe water comes very near the surface, a more shallow and fibrous\r\nrooting plant, like the Eastern red clover, should be substituted for\r\nalfalfa in California. It is a very vigorous grower and will yield a\r\nnumber of crops in succession although the water might be very near the\r\nsurface, as in the case of the reclaimed islands in the Stockton and\r\nSacramento regions and in shallow irrigated soils over bedrock in the\r\nfoothills or over hardpan on the valley plains. In this statement,\r\nfreedom from alkali is presumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVetches in San joaquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Michigan I was familiar with the use of the sand vetch as a forage\r\nplant, for hay, for green manure, and as a nitrogen producer. In western\r\nMichigan, on the loose sandy soil, I sowed in September or October 20\r\npounds per acre for a seed crop and 40 pounds per acre for pasture, hay,\r\nor green manure. Can I expect good results in Fresno and Tulare counties\r\nwithout irrigation? Will fall seeding the same as wheat produce a seed\r\ncrop? Will sand vetch grow on soil having one-half of one per cent\r\nalkali?\r\n\r\nMost of the vetches grow well in the California valleys during the rainy\r\nseason; the common vetch, Vicia sativa, and the hairy vetch, Vicia\r\nhirsuta, are giving best results. The proper time to plant is at the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season. They will stand some alkali, especially\r\nduring the rainy season, when it is likely to be distributed by the\r\ndownward movement of water, but it is very easy to find land which has\r\ntoo much alkali for them. These plants seed well in some parts of the\r\nvalley, but a local trial must be made to give you definite information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Vetch for Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pounds of vetch seed should be sown to the acre? How many tons\r\nper acre in the crop? As I desire to change my crop, having to some\r\nextent exhausted the soil with oats, how advisable will it be to sow\r\nwheat with the vetch to give it something to climb on? If so, and wheat\r\nis not desirable under the circumstances, what? In using vetch for horse\r\nfodder, how much barley should be fed with it per day for a driving\r\nhorse? For a draught horse? Is vetch sown and harvested at about the\r\nsame time as other crops?\r\n\r\nExcept in very frosty places, vetch can be sown after the rain begins at\r\nabout 40 to 60 pounds of seed to the acre. The yield will depend upon\r\nthe land and on the moisture supply, and cannot be prophesied. One\r\ngrower reports three tons of hay per acre near Napa. If the land usually\r\nyields a good hay crop, it should yield a greater weight of vetch. In\r\nmowing for hay purposes it is desirable to raise the vetch off the\r\nground to facilitate the action of the mower. Oats would be better than\r\nwheat, because rather quicker in winter growth. If the vetch is to be\r\nfed green, rye is a good grain, but not good for hay purposes because of\r\nthe hardness of the stem. There is no particular difference in the\r\nplant-food requirements of the different grains, so that there is\r\nnothing gained in that way in the choice of wheat. In feeding a combined\r\nvetch and barley hay, the ration is balanced; the feeding of grain would\r\nnot be necessary, except in case of hard work under the same conditions\r\ngrain is usually fed to horses and in about the same amounts. Vetch\r\nrequires a longer season than ordinary oat or barley hay crop to make a\r\nlarger growth, consequently an early sowing is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCover Crop in Hop Yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you please give information concerning cow peas or the most\r\nsuitable crop to sow in a hop field for winter growth, to be plowed\r\nunder as a fertilizer in the spring? Also, would it injure the vines to\r\nbe cut down before they die, so as to sow the mulch crop soon as\r\npossible after the hops are gathered?\r\n\r\nCow peas would not do for the use which you propose, because they would\r\nbe speedily killed by frost on low lands, usually chosen for hops, and\r\nwould give you no growth during the frosty season. Probably there is\r\nnothing better than burr clover for such a winter growth. Hop vines\r\nshould be allowed to grow as long as they maintain the thrifty green\r\ncolor, because the growth of the leaves strengthens the root. But when\r\nthey begin to become weakened and yellow they can be removed without\r\ninjury. It is not necessary to wait for them to become fully dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Cowpeas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best variety of cow peas for a forage crap? I want a variety\r\nwhich with irrigation will come up after it has been cut, so as to keep\r\ngrowing and not be like some which I tried last year. They grew up like\r\nordinary garden peas and were just a waste of ground.\r\n\r\nPossibly you did not get cowpeas; they do not look like garden peas at\r\nall: they look more like running beans, which they are. The crop is not\r\ncounted satisfactory except on low, moist land, for on uplands, even\r\nwith irrigation, it does not seem to behave right. We do not know that a\r\nsecond growth can be expected, for in the Southern States it is grown as\r\na single crop, and resowing is done if a succession is desired, the\r\npoint being made at the South that the plant is adapted to this method\r\nof culture because it grows so rapidly that it can be twice sown and\r\nharvested during the frost-free period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCowpeas in the San Joaquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow late in the season will it be profitable to plant cowpeas? What is\r\nthe best manner of planting? Are there several varieties? If so, which\r\none is best adapted to plant after oats? The land can be irrigated until\r\nabout August 10. Will it be advisable to plow up a poor stand of alfalfa\r\nabout July 1 and plant to cow peas?\r\n\r\nYou can plant cowpeas all summer on land which is moist enough by\r\nnatural moisture or irrigation to promote growth. What you will get by\r\nlate planting depends upon moisture and absence of an early fall frost.\r\nIf your alfalfa stand is bad enough to need re-sowing anyway, you may\r\nget a good catch crop of cowpeas by doing as you propose. If, however,\r\nyou plow under much coarse stuff in putting in the peas the growth may\r\nbe irregular. It can, of course, be improved by free irrigation. On\r\nclear land moderately retentive much more is being done in summer growth\r\nof cowpeas without irrigation than expected. There are several good\r\nvarieties. One of these is the Whippoorwill. Cowpeas can be sown in\r\nfurrows three feet apart and cultivated, using about 40 pounds of seed\r\nto the acre, or they may be broadcasted, which takes about twice as much\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCowpeas and Canadian Peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould Canadian field peas and cow peas be valuable as a forage crop for\r\ncows and hogs; also as fertilizer? Please tell us also when to plant,\r\nhow to plant, etc.\r\n\r\nThese plants are of high forage value as cow feed; also as a soil\r\nrestorative when the whole crop is plowed under green or when the roots\r\nand manure from feeding add to the soil. But for either purpose the\r\nresult depends upon how much growth you can get, and that should be told\r\nby local trial before any great outlay is undertaken. Canadian peas are\r\nhardy against frost and can be broadcasted and covered with shallow\r\nplowing as soon as the land is moist enough from fall rains - except in\r\nvery frosty parts of the State. They can also be sown in drills to\r\nadvantage. Cow peas are beans, and cannot be planted until frost danger\r\nis over in the spring. They are only available for summer feeding, and\r\nwhether they will be worth while or not depends upon how much moisture\r\ncan be held in the soil for summer growth. They should be sown in drills\r\nand cultivation continued for moisture conservation until the plants\r\ncover the ground too much to get the cultivator through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCanadian or Niles Peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI send a sample of peas which I bought for Canada field peas, and they\r\nwere so labeled. I would like to know what they are.\r\n\r\nThe peas are, apparently, one kind of Canada peas. There is some\r\nvariation in Canada peas, but these are peas of that class. Some of the\r\nCanada pea are hardly distinguishable from the so-called Niles pea of\r\nCalifornia growth, and it does not matter much, anyway, for one is about\r\nas good as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunflowers and Soy Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like information concerning cultivation, method of feeding and\r\nfood value of soy beans. Also sunflowers.\r\n\r\nSoy beans are grown like other beans, in rows which, for convenience in\r\nfield culture, should be about 2 1/2 feet apart and cultivated up to\r\nblooming time at least. They should be sown after frost danger is over\r\nand the weather is settled warm, for they enjoy heat. For feeding they\r\ncan be made into hay before maturity, or the beans can be matured and\r\nprepared for feeding by grinding. As with other beans, small amounts\r\nshould be used in connection with other feeds. They are a rich food and\r\nsomewhat heavy on the digestion. The same is true of sunflowers, except\r\nthat the seed is richer in oil than in protein, as beans are. Sunflowers\r\nin field culture are planted and cultivated like beans. The seed is\r\nflailed out of the heads after they lie for a time to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJersey Kale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease inform me how to plant Jersey or cow kale.\r\n\r\nJersey kale can be planted by thin scattering of seeds in rows 2 1/2\r\nfeet apart so as to admit of cultivation, or the plants can be grown\r\njust as cabbage plants are and set out 2 1/2 or 3 feet apart, the\r\nsquares to admit of  cultivation both ways. The plant needs a good deal\r\nmore space than an ordinary cabbage, for it makes a tall free growth,\r\nand space must be had for the growth of the plant and for going into the\r\npatch for stripping off leaves and cultivation. The plant can be started\r\nin the rainy season whenever the land comes into good condition. It is a\r\nwinter grower in California valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRape and Milo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould rape be a good pasture crop sown broadcast? If so, at what time\r\nshould it be planted? Will Milo maize grow profitable in Sonoma county?\r\n\r\nRape can be sown as soon as the land gets moist enough from early rains\r\nto start the seed and hold the growth. It is a wintergrowing plant in\r\nthis State. We believe, however, you will get better results with common\r\nvetch, which is also a winter grower and more nutritious. If you desire\r\none of the cabbage family, kale will probably serve you better than\r\nrape. Milo is one of the sorghums and will only grow during the\r\nfrostless period, like Kafir, Egyptian corn and other sorghums. It will\r\ndo well with you, but probably make less growth than in the interior\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Clover Not an Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI send you a sample of alfalfa which grows very vigorous here on my\r\nplace spontaneously and would like you to give me all the information\r\nabout it you will, as a feed for cows and hogs. The stock seem to eat it\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe plant is not alfalfa at all. It is white sweet clover (melilotus\r\nalba), and it is usually considered a great pest in alfalfa fields,\r\nbecause although it grows vigorously as you describe, it is not\r\ngenerally accepted by stock, unless once in awhile some one considers it\r\na good thing, perhaps because he keeps stock hungry enough to enjoy it\r\nin spite of its rank taste and smell, but, usually when they can get\r\nalfalfa they will not pay much attention to this plant. It is good for\r\nbee pasturage, however, and is grown to some extent for that purpose.\r\nYou probably had the seed of it in your alfalfa seed. It is a biennial\r\nand not a perennial like alfalfa. It will disappear if you can keep it\r\nfrom going to seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet Clover as a Cover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow about melilotus as a cover crop? Last year in certain sections it\r\nproved very successful, while in others it did not give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMelilotus, by virtue of its hardiness in growing at low temperatures,\r\nits depth of root penetration, the availability of the seed, the\r\nsmallness of the seed so that the weight required for the acre is not\r\nlarge, is to be favored for a cover crop. The objections are two: The\r\nfact that it does not seem to grow well under some conditions; second,\r\nthat when a growth is made it is coarse and rangey, and the amount of\r\ngreen stuff to the acre is much less than its appearance would indicate.\r\nWe know of cases where what seemed to be a good stand of melilotus\r\nyielded only about ten tons of green stuff to the acre, and what\r\nappeared to be a less growth of vetches or peas yielded from fifteen to\r\ntwenty tons to the acre. And yet we believe that in some places it will\r\nbe found extremely desirable for a cover crop in harmony with what was\r\nreported some time ago as the result of experiments by the Arizona\r\nExperiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpineless Cactus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems to be two distinct kinds of cactus: One for forage, the\r\nother for fruit. It is claimed by some people that the spineless cactus\r\nis more valuable as a forage plant than alfalfa. What is your opinion?\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of smooth cacti. Some of them bear higher\r\nquality fruit than others, and some are freer growers and bear a greater\r\namount of leaf substance for forage purposes; therefore, varieties are\r\nbeing developed which are superior for fruit or for forage, as the case\r\nmay be. Spineless cactus is in no way comparable with alfalfa, either in\r\nnutritive content or in value of crop, providing you have land and water\r\nwhich will produce a good product of alfalfa. Cactus is for lands which\r\nare in an entirely different class and which are not capable of alfalfa\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably Not Broom-Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a side-hill ranch on which I would very much like to raise broom\r\ncorn. The soil produces good grapes, fruit, corn, oats, peas, etc., and\r\nI wish to know if there are possibilities of broom-straw.\r\n\r\nAll the broom-corn which has been successfully produced in California\r\nhas been produced on moist, riverside land. The plant is a sorghum -\r\nconsequently subject to frost injury, and can only be grown during the\r\nfrostless season as Indian corn is. This makes it impossible to get the\r\nadvantage of rainfall on winter upland and necessitates the use of\r\nlowlands, which carry moisture enough to secure a free growth of the\r\nbrush, for poor broom-corn is worthless practically, being too low\r\npriced to be profitable for brooms and too fibrous to be of value for\r\nfeeding purposes. Even in a place where the plant grows well its product\r\nis worthless unless properly treated, and that requires full knowledge\r\nand a good deal of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Outlook for Broom Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBroom corn is way up in price, but that is an indication that everyone\r\nwho has ever grown broom corn is likely to plant it this year. What is\r\nthe outlook in California?\r\n\r\nNothing but a local experiment will determine whether you can get a\r\nsatisfactory brush under the conditions prevailing in your vicinity.\r\nUndoubtedly, the high price of broom corn will stimulate production, but\r\nunder quite sharp limitations in California, because a good,\r\nsatisfactory brush cannot be grown on dry plains, although a good\r\nproduct is made in the river bottoms not far away. But there are so few\r\npeople in California who understand how to handle broom corn to produce\r\na good commercial article, and there are such rigid requirements in the\r\nsize, quality, etc., that those who break into the business without\r\nproper knowledge cannot command even profitable prices. Therefore, if\r\nyour enterprise is conducted with a full knowledge and with proper local\r\nconditions it would not encounter such a local disadvantage in the great\r\nincrease of the product as one might think at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmutty Sorghum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various plantings of Egyptian corn on the ranch have turned smutty,\r\nvery much after the manner of wheat and barley. Is there any unusual\r\nreason for this, or could irrigation have caused it, and what is the\r\nbest method of preventing it?\r\n\r\nSorghum is affected by a smut similar to that of other grains. It is due\r\nto the introduction of the germ of the disease which comes with the use\r\nof smutty seed. Possibly the growth of the smut may have been promoted\r\nby moisture arising from soil rendered very wet by irrigation, and for\r\nthis plant free irrigation should not be used, because it will do more\r\nwith less water than any other plant we are growing, and is likely to be\r\nmore thrifty in a drier atmosphere. Get seed for next year from an\r\nabsolutely clean field; get as much growth as you can without\r\nirrigation, and then use water in moderate quantities as may be\r\nnecessary, followed by a cultivation for the drying of the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate-sown Sorghum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow late can Egyptian corn be planted on good sediment soil capable of\r\ngrowing 40 to 50 socks of barley per acre in good years with ordinary\r\nrain? The field was cut this year for hay on account of rank growth of\r\nwild oats, after irrigating; land is still moist. Can I put in Egyptian\r\ncorn with on assurance of crop, or is it too late? How much seed should\r\nbe planted to the acre, also should seed be drilled in or broad-casted?\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in getting a start of Egyptian corn during the\r\ndry season providing the soil contains moisture enough to germinate the\r\nseed. Afterward the growth will be more or less according to the\r\nmoisture present and will be available for forage purposes. Whether a\r\nseed crop can be had by late sowing depends upon the frost occurrence in\r\nthe particular locality, for it only takes a light frost to destroy the\r\nplant. To get the best results, particularly with late sowing, the seeds\r\nshould be drilled in rows far enough apart for horse cultivation; about\r\nforty pounds of seed to the acre. What you get in this way will depend\r\nupon the amount of moisture in the soil and the duration of the\r\nfrost-freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKaffir and Egyptian Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Kaffir corn yield as well here as Egyptian corn? The fodder is good\r\nfeed and the heads stand erect and at a more even height from the\r\nground, which makes three advantages over Egyptian. Irrigation in either\r\ncase is the some.\r\n\r\nThe reasons you mention have no doubt had much to do with the present\r\npopularity of an upright plant like Kafir over a gooseneck like the old\r\ndhoura or Egyptian, which was the type first introduced in California.\r\nFor years there has been more gooseneck sorghum in the Sacramento valley\r\nthan in any other part of the State. It may have superior local\r\nadaptions or the people may be more conservative. The way to determine\r\nwhich is better is to try it out, and, unless the Egyptian does better\r\nin grain and forage than the upright growers, take to the grain which\r\nholds its head up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorghums for Seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich sorghum is the most profitable to plant for the seed only White\r\nEgyptian, Brawn Egyptian or Yellow Mila?\r\n\r\nWhich sorghum is best is apparently a local question and governed by\r\nlocal conditions to a certain extent. Egyptian corn (with the goose-neck\r\nstem) has held more popularity in your part of the Sacramento than\r\nelsewhere, while Kaffir corn (holding its head upright, as do many other\r\nsorghums) has been for years very popular in the San Joaquin. In the\r\nImperial valley Dwarf Milo is chiefly grown for a seed crop shattering\r\nand bird invasion are very important. G. W. Dairs of the San Joaquin\r\nvalley, says there is a very great difference in the different varieties\r\nregarding waste from the blackbird. The ordinary white Egyptian corn is\r\nvery easily shelled, and the birds waste many times more of the grain\r\nthan they eat, after it has become thoroughly ripe. The Milo maize, or\r\nred Egyptian corn, does not shell nearly so easily as the white corn,\r\nand the grain is considerably harder and less attractive to the\r\nblackbirds. In fact, blackbirds will not work in a field of this variety\r\nof corn if there is any white corn in the vicinity to be had. The dwarf\r\nMilo maize yields much more crop than the white Egyptian corn, or any\r\nother variety. Blackbirds do not damage the white Kaffir corn to the\r\nextent they do the ordinary white Egyptian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorghum Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to sow Egyptian corn; also how much per acre to\r\nsow?\r\n\r\nAll the sorghums, of which Egyptian corn is one, must be sown after\r\nfrost danger is over - the time widely known as suitable for Indian\r\ncorn, squashes and other tender plants. Sow thinly in shallow furrows or\r\n\"marks,\" 3 1/2 or 4 feet apart and cultivate as long as you can easily\r\nget through the rows with a horse. About 8 pounds of seed is used per\r\nacre. If grown for green fodder, sow more thickly and make the rows\r\ncloser, say 2 1/2 feet apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuckwheat Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three farmers in this locality desire to plant buckwheat. Not\r\nhaving done so heretofore they are in doubt as to the soil and other\r\nconditions that go to make a successful crop.\r\n\r\nThe growing of buckwheat in California is an exceedingly small affair.\r\nThe local market is very limited, as most California hot cakes are made\r\nof wheat flour. There is no chance for outward shipment, and the crop\r\nitself, being capable of growing only during the frostless season, has\r\nto be planted on moist lands where there is not only abundant summer\r\nmoisture but an air somewhat humid. Irrigated uplands, even in the\r\nfrostless season, are hardly suitable for the common buckwheat, although\r\nthey may give the growth of Japanese buckwheat for beekeepers who use\r\ndark honey for bee feeding. The Japanese buckwheat is well suited for\r\nthis because it keeps blooming and produces a scattered crop of seed,\r\nbut this characteristic makes it less suitable for a grain crop, and it\r\nhas therefore never become very popular in this State. We consider\r\nbuckwheat as not worthy of much consideration by California farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation in Russian Sunflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an acre of mammoth Russian sunflowers there seems to be three\r\nvarieties, some of the plants bear but one large flower; others bear a\r\nflower at the top with many other smaller ones circling it, while others\r\nhave long stalks just above the leaf stems from the ground level all the\r\nway up to the largest flower, which appears at the very top. Are all\r\nthese varieties true mammoth Russian sunflowers? What explanation is\r\nthere for these variations? Will the seed from the variety carrying but\r\none natural head produce seed that will reproduce true to the parent?\r\n\r\nYour sunflowers are probably only playing the pranks their grandfathers\r\nenjoyed. If seed is gathered indiscriminately from all the heads which\r\nappear in the crop, succeeding generations will keep reverting until\r\nthey return to the wild type, or something near it. If there is a clear\r\nidea of what is the best type (one great head or several heads, placed\r\nin a certain way) and seed is continually taken from such plants only\r\nfor planting, more and more plants will be of this kind until the type\r\nbecomes fixed and reversions will only rarely appear. No seed should be\r\nkept for planting without selecting it from what you consider the best\r\ntype of plant; no field should be grown for commercial seed without\r\nrogue-ing out the plants which show reversions or bad variations. If you\r\nfind sunflowers profitable as a crop in your locality, rigid selection\r\nof seed should be practiced by all growers, after careful comparison of\r\nviews and a decision as to the best characters to select for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSacaline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy attention has been brought to a plant called Sacaline by an Eastern\r\nplant dealer. He states that this plant will grow in any kind of soil\r\nand needs practically no water.\r\n\r\nThe plant Sacaline (Polygonum saghalience) was introduced to California\r\nas a dry-land forage plant about 1893, and has never demonstrated any\r\nparticular forage value. It is a browsing shrub, making woody stem, and\r\ncattle will eat it readily when not provided with better food. It has\r\npossible value on waste land, but probably is in no sense superior to\r\nthe native shrubs of California which serve that purpose. It is a\r\nhandsome ornamental plant for gardens or parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMossy Lawns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will destroy patches of moss which are spreading over our lawns and\r\napparently destroying the grass?\r\n\r\nMore sunlight would have a tendency to discourage the growth of moss on\r\na lawn. If this is not feasible, irrigation less frequently but a more\r\nthorough soaking each time will give the surface a better chance to dry\r\noff, and moss will not grow on a dry surface. The frequent spraying of a\r\nlawn with just enough water to keep the surface moist and not enough\r\nwater to penetrate deeply will tend to the growing of moss and to less\r\nvigor in the growth of the grass, A good soaking of the soil once a week\r\nis better than daily sprinkling, but, of course, very much more water\r\nmust be used when you only sprinkle at long intervals. The drying of the\r\nsurface may be assisted by sprinkling with air-slaked lime and this will\r\ndiscourage the growth of moss, but of course lime must not be used in\r\nexcess or it will also injure the grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScattering Grass Seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe live on the west side of Sonoma valley, and want to seed some of our\r\nfields with a good wild grass. We want to carry bags of it in our\r\npockets to scatter when we ride. Timothy we should like, but this is not\r\nits habitat, is it? Can you suggest a grass or grasses that would do\r\nwell here?\r\n\r\nThere are really wild grasses worthy of multiplication, but no one makes\r\na business of collecting the seed for sale, so that such seeds are not\r\navailable for such purpose as you describe. Of the introduced grasses,\r\nthose which are most likely to catch from early scattered seed are\r\nAustralian and Italian rye grasses, orchard grass, wild oat grass and\r\nred top. You can get seed of all these from dealers in any quantity\r\nwhich you desire at from 15 to 30 cents a pound, according to the\r\nvariety, and make a mixture of equal parts of each grass, which you can\r\ncarry and scatter as you propose. Some of them will catch somewhere,\r\nparticularly in spots where the shade modifies the summer heat and where\r\nseepage moisture reduces soil drought. You are right about timothy; it\r\nis good farther up the coast and in the mountain valleys, but not in\r\nyour district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry Forage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have light sandy loam on which I desire to grow forage for chickens.\r\nIt lies too high for irrigation.\r\n\r\nYou could probably grow alfalfa to advantage if the soil still deep and\r\nloose, getting less, of course, than by irrigation, but still an amount\r\nthat would be very helpful in your chicken business. Otherwise, as the\r\nland lies higher and perhaps out of sharp frosts, you could grow winter\r\ncrops of vetches and peas and thus improve the land while furnishing you\r\nadditional poultry pasture. The latter purpose could also be served by\r\ngrowing beets, cabbage or other hardy vegetables during the rainy\r\nseason. This is prescribed because of the apprehension that the soil may\r\nnot contain moisture enough for summer cropping without irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Grain Elevators in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs California wheat shipped in bulk or in bags at the present time?\r\n\r\nThere are no elevators in this State, owing to the fact that hitherto\r\ngrain cargoes have been acceptable to ship only as sacked grain, because\r\nof claimed danger of shifting cargo and disaster during the long voyage\r\naround the Horn. A novel by Frank Norris, entitled the \"Octopus,\"\r\ndescribes a man being killed by smothering in a grain elevator at Port\r\nCosta, but there never was an elevator at that point, and consequently\r\nthere never was a man killed by getting under the spout thereof.\r\nAnswering specifically your question, California grain is shipped in\r\nbags and not in bulk. It is handled in sacks from the separator to\r\nroadside or riverside storage, to the loading point into the ships and\r\nout of the ships on the other side - still in bags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Zealand Flax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive information about Phormiun tenax (New Zealand flax), which I see is\r\nimported to San Francisco in large quantities yearly for making cordage\r\nand binder twine, and is said also to be the best of bee pasture. Can I\r\nget the plants on the coast, and is California soil and climate adapted\r\nto the culture?\r\n\r\nNew Zealand flax grows admirably in the coast region of California. You\r\nwill find it in nearly all the public parks and in private gardens, for\r\nit is a very ornamental perennial. Plants can be had in any quantity\r\nfrom the California nurserymen and florists. It produces plenty of\r\nleaves, but we should doubt whether it is floriferous enough for bee\r\npasturage except where it occurs wild over a large acreage. You could\r\nget vastly more honey from other plants grown for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Home-made Beet Sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any simple process of making sugar from beets so that I could\r\nmake my own sugar at home from my own beets while sugar is so very\r\nexpensive to buy?\r\n\r\nThere is no simple way of making beet sugar. It can only be economically\r\ndone in factories costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't Get Crazy About Special Crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want information about flax as a crop. I have been having some land\r\ngraded for alfalfa and I have had to wait so long I am now doubting the\r\nadvisability of seeding it all under these conditions until fall, as hot\r\nweather will soon come. I want some good crop to plant in the checks and\r\ngive two good irrigations. What would you think about rye for straw for\r\nhorse collars? I do not wish to consider corn, as the stalks would be\r\ntroublesome. Potatoes would necessitate disarranging the land too much\r\nand would require more attention than I am in shape to give just flow.\r\nEverybody grows wheat, barley and oats. I want something that I can get\r\na special market for.\r\n\r\nTo succeed with flax, the seed ought to be sown in the fall, or early\r\nwinter, in California, and the plant will make satisfactory growth under\r\nabout the same conditions that suit barley or wheat. Spring sowing would\r\nnot give you anything worth while except on moist bottom land. Rye is\r\nalso a winter-growing grain. To grow rye straw for horse collars would\r\nbe unprofitable unless you could find some local saddler who could use a\r\nlittle, and it is probable you could not get a summer growth of rye\r\nwhich would give good straw, even if you had a market for it. You could\r\nget a growth of stock beets, field squashes, or pumpkins for stock\r\nfeeding. In fact, the latter would give you most satisfaction if you\r\nhave stock to which they can be fed to advantage. Sorghum is our chief\r\ndry-season crop, but that makes stalks like corn and would, therefore,\r\nbe open to the same objections. Has it never occurred to you that people\r\ngrow the common crops, not because they are stupid, but because those\r\nare the things for which there is a constant demand and the best chance\r\nfor profitable sale? Efforts to supply special markets are worth\r\nthinking of, but seldom worth making unless you know just who is going\r\nto buy the product and at what price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia Insect Powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part of the plant is used in making insect powder and how is it\r\nprepared? Is the plant a perennial? What soil suits it best?\r\n\r\nThe plant is Pyrethrum cinerariaefolium and has a white blossom\r\nresembling the common marguerite. The powder is made of the petals and\r\nthe seed capsules or heads are thoroughly dried in the sun and ground\r\nwith a run of stone such as was formerly used for making flour. The\r\npowder must be finely ground, and only good powder can be made in a mill\r\nsuitably equipped for that purpose. The plant is a perennial, beginning\r\nto bloom the second year from seed. It will grow in any good soil with\r\nordinary cultivation. Twenty-five years ago it was thought that a great\r\nCalifornia industry might be established on that basis, but there is at\r\nthe present time but one establishment, which grows about all the\r\nmaterial it can use on its own ranch in Merced county, on a fine, deep\r\nloam which the plant seems to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRotations for California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to work out a practical system of crop rotation suitable to the\r\nclimate and conditions obtaining in southern California. Would you\r\nrecommend different systems for grain lands and irrigated lands?\r\n\r\nGeneral schemes of rotation are hard to work out in California. They\r\nmust be locally revised according to the local temperature conditions\r\nand the local market also. We should endeavor to find out what has been\r\nsuccessfully grown on similar lands to those which you have in mind and\r\narrange the rotation on that basis, from what we knew of the relation of\r\nthe different plants to soil fertility, etc. You cannot make out a\r\nsatisfactory local scheme for the seven counties in southern California,\r\nbecause of the widely different behavior of the separate plants in the\r\ndifferent parts of the district. You can hardly work on the basis of\r\nsoil character: moisture supply and temperatures are more determinative.\r\nSurely you should make a scheme for irrigated land different from that\r\nfor dry land, and it could not only be a longer rotation, but many more\r\nplants would be available for its service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerseem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerseem has been introduced into this country from Egypt, and would like\r\nto know if it has been used in California, and if it has came up to\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nBerseem is an annual clover supposed to grow only during the summer\r\ntime. It has been tried widely in California, but practically abandoned\r\nbecause it will not grow during the rainy season. It is in no way\r\ncomparable to alfalfa, which is a deep rooted perennial plant, nor would\r\nit be comparable with burr clover as a winter grower on lands which have\r\na moderate amount of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeating and Fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease explain why dampness will cause anything like hay, Egyptian corn\r\nor other like products to heat.\r\n\r\nHeating is due to fermentation, which means the action upon the\r\nvegetable substance of germs which begin to grow and multiply after\r\ntheir kind whenever conditions favor them. The earlier stages of this\r\naction is called \"sweating,\" and it is beneficial as in the case of hay,\r\ntobacco, dried fruits, etc., as is commonly recognized - resulting in\r\nwhat is known as curing - and it is the art of the handler of such\r\nproducts not to allow the action to go beyond what may be called the\r\nnormal \"sweating.\" If not checked by proper handling, which involves\r\ndrying, cooling, etc., fermentation will continue, and other germs will\r\nfind conditions suitable for them to take up their work of destruction,\r\nand this new action produces higher temperature still, and if not\r\nchecked by cooling or drying or otherwise making the substance\r\ninhospitable to them, \"heating\" will result, and thence onward rapidly\r\nto decay, if they have everything their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoonshine Farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat influence, if any, has the moon on plant growth? Are there any\r\nreliable data of experiments available?\r\n\r\nVery prolonged investigation by the Weather Bureau determined that no\r\ndifference was found in planting in different phases of the moon. If we\r\npaid any attention to it, we should plant in the dark of the moon, so as\r\nto get the plants up so that they could use the little more light which\r\nthe moon gives. It is, however, more important to have the soil right\r\nthan the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV. Soils, Fertilizers and Irrigation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Intensive Cultivation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whom can I receive instruction or information regarding intensive\r\ncultivation?\r\n\r\nIntensive cultivation has, so far as we know, not been made the subject\r\nof any treatise or publication. Intensive cultivation means the use of a\r\nmaximum amount of labor, fertilizers and water for products of high\r\nmarket value. There is no better example of intensive cultivation in the\r\nworld than is afforded by the practice of the best market gardeners and\r\nproducers of small fruit. Next to them, on larger areas, would be the\r\npolicies and methods of the fruit growers of California. Intensive\r\nculture, then, is not a particular method or system, but consists in\r\ndoing the best thing for maximum production of any product which is\r\nvaluable enough to spend the large outlay which is required. Just how\r\nthis cultivation should be done depends upon the nature of the product\r\nand the conditions of soil and climate in whatever locality intensive\r\ncultivation may be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan a Man Farm?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it possible for a man with a few acres well cared for and carefully\r\ntilled to make a living and pay out on a purchase of land at $123 per\r\nacre? Could a good carpenter make wages and take care of a small tract\r\nfor a year or so until well under way?\r\n\r\nWe consider $125 per acre for good land with a good water right a fair\r\nprice. Financing a farming operation depends more upon the man than upon\r\nthe good land. There are men who would, by intensive cultivation of\r\nsalable stuff and right use of water, pay off the full value of the land\r\nfrom its produce in a couple of years. Others will never pay off. Of\r\ncourse, the nearer you can come to paying for the land at the beginning,\r\nand the more money you have for improvements, the more satisfactory your\r\nsituation should be in every respect. There is a good chance for\r\ncarpenter work in colony development, and considerable self-help could\r\nbe secured in that way. You do not say whether you know anything about\r\nfarming. Farming is a very complicated business and a basic knowledge\r\nderived from experience is a proper foundation to build upon in the\r\nlight of the fuller application of scientific principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil Depth for Citrus Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a top soil of rich loam containing small rocks and pebbles.\r\nUnderneath it is washed gravel, rocks, boulders, yellow sand, etc. What\r\nis the limit as to thinness before trees will not grow, or thrive?\r\n\r\nOrange trees are growing quite successfully on shallow soil overlying\r\nclay where the use of water and fertilizers was carefully adjusted so as\r\nto keep the trees supplied with just the right amount. Under such\r\nconditions a good growth may be expected so long as this treatment is\r\nmaintained. There should be, however, not less than three feet of good\r\nsoil to make the large expenditure necessary to establish an orange\r\norchard permanently productive, and all the depth you can get beyond\r\nthree feet is desirable. We question the desirability of planting orange\r\ntrees even on a good soil overlying gravel, rocks or sand. Roots will\r\npenetrate such material only a short distance usually. It is almost\r\nimpossible with such a leachy foundation to keep the surface soil\r\nproperly moistened and enriched; You are apt to lose both water and\r\nfertilizer into the too rapid drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoils and Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find this entire district underlaid with hardpan at various depths,\r\nfrom 1 to 6 feet down, and of various thicknesses. This hardpan is more\r\nor less porous and seeps up water to some extent, but is too hard for\r\nroots to penetrate. It is represented to me that if this hard pan is\r\ndown from 4 to 5 feet it does not interfere with the growth of the\r\norange tree or its producing. Is 4 or 5 feet of the loam enough?\r\n\r\nFour or five feet of good soil over a hardpan, which was somewhat\r\nporous, is likely to be satisfactory for orange planting. There has been\r\ntrouble from hardpan too near the surface and from the occurrence of a\r\nhardpan too rich in lime, which has resulted in yellow leaf and other\r\nmanifestations of unthrift in the tree. Discussion of this subject is\r\ngiven on page 434 of the fifth edition of our book on \"California\r\nFruits,\" where we especially commend a good depth of \"strong, free\r\nloam.\" This does not mean necessarily deep. The orange likes rather a\r\nheavier soil, while a deep sandy loam is preferred by some other fruits.\r\nIf you keep the moisture supply regular and right and feed the plant\r\nwith fertilizers, as may be required, the soil you mention is of\r\nsufficient depth - if it is otherwise satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOranges Over High Ground Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes California experience show that citrus trees can be grown upon land\r\nsuccessfully where the water-level is 6 feet from the surface; that is,\r\nwhere water is found at that level at all seasons and does not appear to\r\nrise higher during the rainy season?\r\n\r\nWe do not know of citrus trees in California with ground-water\r\npermanently at six feet below the surface. If the soil should be a free\r\nloam and the capillarity therefore somewhat reduced, orange trees would\r\nprobably be permanently productive. If the soil were very heavy,\r\ncapillary rise might be too energetic and saturate the soil for some\r\ndistance above the water-level. In a free soil without this danger the\r\nroots could approach the water as they find it desirable and be\r\npermanently supplied. Orange trees are largely dependent upon a shallow\r\nroot system, the chief roots generally occupying the first four feet\r\nbelow the surface. From this fact we conclude that deep rooting is not\r\nnecessary to the orange, although unquestionably deep rooting and deep\r\npenetration for water are desirable as allowing the tree to draw upon a\r\nmuch greater soil mass and therefore be less dependent upon frequent\r\nirrigations and fertilizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepth of Ground-Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there probable harm from water standing 12 feet from the surface in\r\nan orchard? Also probable age of trees before any effect of said water\r\nwould be felt by them? The soil is almost entirely chocolate dry bog. -\r\nW. E. Wahtoke.\r\n\r\nWater at twelve feet from the surface is desirable, and water at that\r\npoint will be indefinitely desirable for the growing of fruit trees. Of\r\ncourse, conditions would change rapidly as standing water might approach\r\nmore nearly to the surface, a condition which has to be carefully\r\nguarded against in irrigation. But it can come nearer than twelve feet\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Fallow and Summer Cropping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI own some hill land which has been run down by continuous hay cropping.\r\nI am told that a portion must be summer-fallowed each year, but I wish\r\nto grow some summer crop on this fallow ground that will both enrich the\r\nsoil and at the same time furnish good milk-producing feed for cows -\r\nthoroughly cultivating it between the rows. What crop would be best? I\r\nam told the common Kaffir or Egyptian corn are both soil enriching and\r\nmilk producing.\r\n\r\nIf you grow a summer crop on the summer-fallowed upland, you lose the\r\nchief advantage of summer fallowing, which is the storing of moisture\r\nfor the following year's crop. A cultivated crop would waste less\r\nmoisture than a broadcast crop, surely, but on uplands without\r\nirrigation it would take out all the moisture available and not act in\r\nthe line of a summer fallow.\r\n\r\nKaffir corn is not soil enriching. It has no such character. It probably\r\ndepletes the soil just as much as an ordinary corn or hay crop. It is a\r\ngood food to continue a milking period into the dry season, but you must\r\nbe careful not to allow your cattle to get too much green sorghum, for\r\nit sometimes produces fatal results. We do not know anything which you\r\ncan grow during the summer without irrigation which would contribute to\r\nthe fertility of your land. If you had water and could grow clover or\r\nsome legume during the summer season, the desired effect on the soil\r\nwould be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoils and Crop Changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeas and sweet peas do not grow well continuously in the same ground. I\r\nknow this practically in my experience, but in no book have I ever found\r\nwhy they do not grow.\r\n\r\nThere are two very good reasons why some classes of plants cannot be\r\nwell grown continuously in the same piece of ground. One is the\r\ndepletion of available plant food, the other the formation of injurious\r\ncompounds by the plants, or the gradual increase of fungoid, bacterial\r\nor animate pests in the soil, which finally become abundant enough to\r\nseriously hinder growth. Different plants take the plant foods, as\r\nnitrogen, lime, potash, phosphates, etc., in different proportion. More\r\nimportant, perhaps, is the fact that the root acids that extract these\r\nfoods are of different types and strength. Thus before many seasons it\r\nmay happen that most of the plant food of one or more kinds may be\r\nnearly exhausted as far as that kind of plant is concerned that has\r\ngrown there continually, while there would be plenty of easily available\r\nfood for plants with a different kind of root system and different root\r\nacids, etc. This is one reason why rotation of crops is so good; it\r\ngives a combination of root acids and root systems to the soil during a\r\nterm of years, and it also frees the soil from one certain kind of\r\norganism because it cannot survive the absence of the particular plants\r\non which it thrives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer-Fallow Before Fruit Planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently bought a ranch at Sheridan, Placer county, and was intending\r\nto put 10 acres to peaches and 50 acres to wheat or barley, but the\r\nresidents tell me that the land must be summer-fallowed before I can do\r\nanything. The soil is a red loam and has not been plowed for six years.\r\n\r\nYour local advisers are probably right as to the necessity for\r\nsummer-fallowing in order to conserve moisture from a previous year's\r\nrainfall and to get the land otherwise into good condition. There might\r\nbe such a generous rainfall that an excellent crop might come without\r\nsummer-fallowing, and the results will depend upon the rainfall. If it\r\nshould be small in amount, you might not recover your seed. By the same\r\nsign you might not get much growth on your fruit trees, but you could\r\nhelp them by constant cultivation and by using the water-wagon if the\r\nseason should be very dry. Therefore, you are likely to do better with\r\ntrees than with grain without summer-fallowing, although even for trees\r\nit is a decided advantage to have more moisture stored in the subsoil\r\nand the surface soil pulverized by more tillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefects in Soil Moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have apricot trees that appear to be almost dead; all but a very few\r\nsmall green leaves are gone, and they look bad, still I think they might\r\nbe saved if I only knew what to do.\r\n\r\nPresumably your apricot tree is suffering from too much standing water\r\nduring the dormant season, or from a lack of water during the dry\r\nseason. The remedy would be to correct moisture conditions, either by\r\nunderdrainage for winter excess or by irrigation for summer deficiency.\r\nWhen a tree gets into a position such as you describe, it should be cut\r\nback freely and irrigation supplied, if the soil is dry, in the house\r\nthat the roots may be able to restore themselves and promote a new\r\ngrowth in the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Plowing for Soil and Weed Growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any scientific reason to support the belief that it is\r\ninjurious to the soil to dry-plow it for seeding to grain this fall and\r\nwinter? Will dry-plowing now cause a worse growth of filth after the\r\nrains than the customary fallowing in the spring? Should the stubble be\r\nburned, or plowed under!\r\n\r\nThe points against dry-plowing to which you allude may arise from two\r\nclaims or beliefs: first, that turning up land to the sun has a tendency\r\nto \"burn out the humus\"; second, that dry-plowing may leave the land so\r\nrough and cloddy that a small rainfall is currently lost by evaporation\r\nand leaves less moisture available for a crop than if it is plowed in\r\nthe usual way after the rains. The first claim is probably largely\r\nfanciful, so far as an upturning in the reduced sunshine of the autumn\r\ngoes. Whatever there may be in it would occur in vastly increased degree\r\nin a properly worked summer-fallow, and even that is negligible, because\r\nof the greater advantage which the summer-fallow yields. There may be\r\ncases in which one will get less growth on dry-plowing than on winter\r\nplowing, if the land is rough and the rain scant, and yet dry-plowing\r\nbefore the rains is a foundation for moisture reception and retention -\r\nif the land is not only plowed, but is also harrowed or otherwise worked\r\ndown out of its large cloddy condition. When that is done, dry-plowing\r\nmay be a great help toward early sowing and large growth afterward. As\r\nfor weeds, dry-plowing may help their starting, but that is an advantage\r\nand not otherwise, because they can be destroyed by cultivation before\r\nsowing. If the land is full of weed seed, the best thing to do is to\r\nstart it and kill it. The trouble with dry-plowing probably arises, not\r\nfrom the plowing, but from lack of work enough between the plowing and\r\nthe sowing. Stubble should often be burned: it depends upon the soil and\r\nthe rainfall. On a heavy soil with a good rainfall, plowing-in stubble\r\nis an addition to the humus of the soil, because conditions favor its\r\nreduction to that form, and there is moisture enough to accomplish that\r\nand promote also a satisfactory growth of the new crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Dry-Plowed Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are plowing a piece of light sandy mesa land, dry, which has\r\nconsiderable tarweed and other weeds growing before plowing. Which would\r\nbe best, to leave the land as it is until the rains come and then\r\nharrow, or harrow now? Would the land left without harrowing gather any\r\nelements from the air before rain comes! The above land is for oat hay\r\nand beans next season.\r\n\r\nRoll down the 'tar-weed, if it is tall and likely to be troublesome, and\r\nplow in at once so that decay may begin as soon as the land gets\r\nmoisture from the rain. It would be well to allow the land to lie in\r\nthat shape, and disc in the seed without disturbing the weeds which have\r\nbeen plowed under. If all this is done early, with plenty of rain coming\r\nthere is likely to be water enough to settle the soil, decay the weeds,\r\nand grow the hay crop. Of course, such practice could not be commenced\r\nmuch later in the season. The land gains practically nothing from the\r\natmosphere by lying in its present condition. If there is any\r\nappreciable gain, it would be larger after breaking up as proposed. In\r\ndry farming, harrowing or disking should be done immediately after\r\nplowing, not to produce a fine surface as for a seed bed, but to settle\r\nthe soil enough to prevent too free movement of dry air. If your\r\nrainfall is ample, the land may be left looser for water-settling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Refractory Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to soil that dries out and crusts over so hard that it\r\nwon't permit vegetable growth? A liberal amount of stable manure has\r\nbeen applied, and the land deeply plowed, harrowed and cultivated, but\r\nas soon as water gets on it, it forms a deep crust on evaporation. Will\r\nguano help, or is sodium nitrate or potash the thing?\r\n\r\nNone of the things you mention are of any particular use for the\r\nspecific purpose you describe. Keep on working in stable manure or\r\nrotten straw, or any other coarse vegetable matter, when the soil is\r\nmoist enough for its decay. Plow under all the weeds you can grow, or\r\ngreen barley or rye, and later grow a crop of peas or vetches to plow in\r\ngreen. Keep at this till the pesky stuff gets mellow. If you think the\r\nsoil is alkaline, use gypsum freely; if not, dose it with lime to the\r\nlimit of your purse and patience, and put in all the tillage you can\r\nwhenever the soil breaks well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Manure, Water and Cultivation Required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a small place on a hillside, with brown soil about one to two\r\nfeet deep to hardpan and I am getting rather discouraged, as so many\r\nthings fail to come up and others grow so very slowly after they are up.\r\nA neighbor planted some dahlia roots the same time I did. Only one of\r\nmine came up and it is not in bloom yet, while several of his have been\r\nblooming for some weeks and are ten times as large in mass of foliage as\r\nmine with its lone stalk and one little bud on the top. Peas came up and\r\nkept dying at the bottom with blossoms at the top tilt they were four or\r\nfive feet high, but I never could get enough peas for a mess. Can you\r\nhelp me get this thing right?\r\n\r\nUse of stable manure and water freely. Your trouble probably lies either\r\nin the lack of plant food or of moisture in the soil. This, of course,\r\nis supposing that you cultivate well so that the moisture you use shall\r\nnot be evaporated and the ground hardened by the process. During the\r\nsummer a good surface application of stable manure to which water can be\r\napplied would be better than to work manure into the soil, which should\r\nbe done at the beginning of the rainy season. As your soil is so shallow\r\nit will be well for you to stand along the side of the plant much of the\r\ntime with a bucket of water in one hand and a shovel of manure in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting Trees in Alkali Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy land contains a considerable quantity of both the black and white\r\nalkalies, the upper two feet being a rather heavy, sticky clay, the next\r\nthree feet below being fine sand, containing more or less alkali, while\r\nimmediately underneath this sand is a dense black muck in which, summer\r\nand winter, is found the ground-water. Do you think the following method\r\nof setting trees would be advantageous. Excavate for each tree a hole\r\nthree feet in diameter and three feet deep. Fill in a layer of three or\r\nfour inches of coarse hay, forming a lining for the excavation. Then\r\nfill the hole with sandy loam in which the tree is to be set. The sandy\r\nloam would give the young tree a good start, while the lining of hay\r\nwould break up the capillary attraction between the filled-in sand and\r\nthe ground-water in the surrounding alkali-charged soil.\r\n\r\nThe fresh soil which you put in would before long be impregnated through\r\nthe surface evaporation of the rising moisture, which your straw lining\r\nwould not long exclude. The trees would not be permanently satisfactory\r\nunder such conditions as you describe, though they might grow well at\r\nfirst. It would be interesting, of course, to make a small-scale\r\nexperiment to demonstrate what would actually occur and it would,\r\nperhaps, give you a chance to sell out to a tenderfoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting in Mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does ground lose its vitality or its growing qualities when it is\r\nplowed or stirred when wet, and does this act in all kinds of soil in\r\nthe same way? We are planting a fig and olive orchard at the present\r\ntime, but some were planted when the ground was extremely wet. The holes\r\nwere dug before the rain and after a heavy rain they started to plant.\r\nAfter placing the trees in the holes they filled them half full with wet\r\ndirt, in fact so wet that it was actually slush. What would you advise\r\nunder the circumstances and what can be done to counteract this? We have\r\nnot finished filling in the holes since the planting was done, which was\r\nabout a week ago.\r\n\r\nThe soil loses its vitality after working when too wet, because it is\r\nthrown into bad mechanical (or physical) condition and therefore becomes\r\ndifficult of root extension and of movement of moisture and air. How\r\neasily soil may be thrown into bad mechanical condition depends upon its\r\ncharacter. A light sandy loam could be plowed and trees planted as you\r\ndescribe without serious injury perhaps, while such a treatment of a\r\nclay would bring a plant into the midst of a soil brick which would\r\ncause it to spindle and perhaps to fail outright. The best treatment\r\nwould consist in keeping the soil around the roots continually moist,\r\nyet not too wet. The upper part of the holes should be filled loosely\r\nand the ground kept from surface compacting. The maintenance of such a\r\ncondition during the coming summer will probably allow the trees to\r\novercome the mistake made at their planting, unless the soil should be a\r\ntough adobe or other soil which has a disposition to act like cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectro-Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly tell me of any one who is working upon the application of\r\nelectricity to stimulating agricultural growth-especially here on the\r\nCoast. A friend who has done some work in this line seeks to interest\r\nme. I have seen notices of this work, and have read of Professor\r\nArrhenius stimulating the mental activity of children, etc., but I\r\ndesire more definite information, if possible. Does the idea seem to you\r\nto be feasible?\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, there has been no local trial of the effect of\r\nelectric light in stimulating plant growth. Much has been done with it\r\nin Europe and in this country. There is much about it in European\r\nscientific literature. It is perfectly rational that increased growth\r\nshould be attained by continuous light in the same way, though in less\r\ndegree than occurs in the extreme north during the period of the\r\nmidnight sun. It is known that moonlight, to the extent of its\r\nillumination, increases plant growth, and it has been amply demonstrated\r\nthat light is light, just as heat is heat, irrespective of the source\r\nthereof. Of course, the commercial advantage must be sought in the\r\nrelative amount of increased growth and the selling value of whatever is\r\ngained in point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Hardpan and Low Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat detriment is hardpan if 14 inches below the surface and in some\r\nplaces 12 inches? I have been plowing so I could set peach trees, but I\r\nhave been told that they will not grow. I would like your opinion about\r\nit. I intended to blast holes for the trees, and the water is 30 feet\r\nfrom surface. The top soil is red sandy and clay mixed, but it works\r\nvery easily.\r\n\r\nYou cannot expect much from trees on such a shallow soil\r\nover hardpan without breaking it up, because the soil mass available to\r\nthe trees is small; also because the shallow surface layer over hardpan\r\nwill soon dry out in spite of the best cultivation, because there is no\r\nmoisture supply from below. If such a soil should be selected for fruit\r\ntrees at all, the breaking through the hardpan by dynamite or otherwise\r\nis desirable, and irrigation will be, probably, indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepth of Cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to know whether in cultivating an orchard a light-draft\r\nharrow could profitably be used, which cultivates three and a half\r\ninches deep? I have used another cultivator, and try to have it go at\r\nleast seven inches.\r\n\r\nA depth of 3 1-2 inches is not satisfactory in orchard cultivation,\r\nalthough there may be some condition under which greater depth would be\r\ndifficult to obtain because of root injury to trees, which have been\r\nencouraged to root near the surface. Both experience and actual\r\ndeterminations of moisture in this State show that cultivation to a\r\ndepth of 5 inches conserves twice as much moisture in the lower soil as\r\ncan be saved by a 3-inch depth of cultivation under similar soil\r\nconditions and water supply. It is all the better to go 7 inches if\r\nyoung trees have been treated that way from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Over Hardpan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land graded for alfalfa and some of the checks are low and water\r\nwill stand on the low checks in the winter. There is on an average from\r\ntwo to three feet of soil on top of hardpan and hardpan is about two\r\nfeet thick. Will water drain off the low checks if the hardpan is\r\ndynamited, and will this land grow alfalfa with profit?\r\n\r\nYes; much of the hardpan in your district is thin enough and underlaid\r\nby permeable strata so that drainage is readily secured by breaking up\r\nthe hardpan. Standing water on dormant alfalfa is not injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees Over High-Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich are the best fruit trees to plant on black adobe soil with water\r\ntable between 3 and 4 feet from surface? The soil is very rich and\r\nproductive. The land is leveled for alfalfa also; will the alfalfa\r\ndisturb the growth of trees?\r\n\r\nWe would not plant such land to fruit at all, except a family orchard.\r\nThe fruits most likely to succeed are pears and pecans. On such land\r\nalfalfa should not hurt trees unless it is allowed to actually strangle\r\nthem. The alfalfa may help the trees by pumping out some of the surplus\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoil Suitable for Fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending samples of soil in which there are apricots and prunes\r\ngrowing, and ask you to examine it with reference to its suitability for\r\nother fruits. Will lemons thrive in this soil?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have analysis of the soil. If you find by\r\nexperience that apricot and prune trees are doing well, it is a\r\ndemonstration of its suitability for the orange, so far as soil is\r\nconcerned. The same would also be a demonstration for soil suitability\r\nfor the lemon because the lemon is always grown on orange root. The\r\nthing to be determined is whether the temperature conditions suit the\r\nlemon and whether you have an irrigation supply available, because\r\ncitrus fruits, being evergreen, require about fifty per cent more\r\nmoisture than deciduous fruits, and they are not grown successfully\r\nanywhere in this State without irrigation, except, possibly, on land\r\nwith underflow. The matter to determine then is the surety of suitable\r\ntemperatures and water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Blowing Soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to dry-sow rye late this fall. I want some leguminous plant\r\nto seed with the rye for a wind-break crop, not to plow under. The land\r\nvaries from heavy loam to blow-sand. I have under consideration sweet\r\nclover, burr clover, vetches. I see occasional stray plants of sweet\r\nclover (the white-blossomed) growing in the alfalfa on both hard and\r\nsandy soil. I read in an Eastern bee journal that sweet clover can be\r\nsowed on hard uncultivated land with success. Could I grow it on the\r\nhard vacant spots that occur in the alfalfa fields?\r\n\r\nYou can sow these leguminous plants all along during the earlier part of\r\nthe rainy season (September to December) except that they will not make\r\na good start in cold ground which does not seem to bother rye much. But\r\non sand you are not likely to get cold, waterlogged soil, so you can put\r\nin there whenever you like - the earlier the better, however, if you\r\nhave moisture enough in the soil to sustain the growth as well as start\r\nit. We should sow rye and common vetch. Sweet clover will grow anywhere,\r\nfrom a river sandbar to an uncovered upland hardpan, but it will not do\r\nmuch if your vacant spots are caused by alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Than Dynamite Needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some peculiar land. People here call it cement. It does not take\r\nirrigation water readily, and water will pass over it for a long time\r\nand not wet down more than an inch or so. When really wet it can be\r\ndipped up with a spoon. Hardpan is down about 24 to 36 inches. I have\r\ntried blowing up between the vines with dynamite, and see little\r\ndifference. Can you suggest anything to loosen up the soil?\r\n\r\nYou could not reasonably expect dynamite to transform the character of\r\nthe surface soil except as its rebelliousness might in some cases be\r\nwholly due to lack of drainage - in that case blasting the hardpan might\r\nwork wonders. But you have another problem, viz: to change the physical\r\ncondition of the surface soil to prevent the particles from running\r\ntogether and cementing. This is to be accomplished by the introduction\r\nof coarse particles, preferably of a fibrous character. To do this the\r\nfree use of rotten straw or stable manure, deeply worked into the soil,\r\nand the growth of green crops for plowing under, is a practical\r\nsuggestion. Such treatment would render your soil mellow, and, in\r\nconnection with blasting of the hardpan to prevent accumulation of\r\nsurplus water over it, would accomplish the transformation which you\r\ndesire. The cost and profit of such a course you can figure out for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Dynamite Needed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an old prune orchard on river bottom lands; soil about 15 or 16\r\nfeet deep. Quite a number of trees have died, I presume from old age. I\r\ndesire to remove them and to replace them with prune trees. I have been\r\nadvised to use dynamite in preparing the soil for the planting of the\r\nnew trees.\r\n\r\nWhether you need dynamite or not depends upon the condition of the\r\nsub-soil. If you are on river flats with an alluvial soil, rather loose\r\nto a considerable depth, dynamiting is not necessary. If, by digging,\r\nyou encounter hardpan, or clay, dynamiting may be very profitable. This\r\nmatter must be looked into, because the failure of trees on river lands\r\nis more often due to their planting over gravel streaks, which too\r\nrapidly draw off water and cause the tree to fail for lack of moisture.\r\nIn such cases dynamite would only aggravate the trouble. Dynamiting\r\nshould be done in the fall and not in the spring. The land should have a\r\nchance to settle and readjust itself by the action of the winter rains;\r\notherwise, your trees may dry out too much next summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving Heavy Soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is adobe? What kind of plants will grow best in adobe? In this\r\nRedwood City I find clay-like soil which looks very dark and heavy. What\r\nkind of plants will grow best in this soil?\r\n\r\nThe term adobe does not mean any particular kind of soil. It is applied\r\nlocally to clay and clay-loam soils indiscriminately. It generally\r\nsignifies the heaviest, stickiest, crackingest soil in the vicinity.\r\nMost plants will grow well on heavy soils if they are kept from getting\r\ntoo dry and too full of water. This is done by using plenty of stable\r\nmanure and other coarse stuff to make the soil more friable, which\r\nfavors aeration, drainage, root extension and plant thrift. Friability\r\nis also promoted by the use of lime and by good tillage. The particular\r\nsoil to which you refer is a black clay loam which can be improved in\r\nall the ways stated. It is a good soil for most flowers and vegetables\r\nif handled as suggested. You can get hints of what does best by studying\r\nyour neighbors' earlier plantings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Reclaimed Swamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land, formerly a pond which dried up in the summer months. It has\r\nbeen thoroughly drained now for several years. The land surrounding it\r\nis good fertile soil and produces good crops. On this piece, however,\r\ncrops come up and look fairly well until about two inches high when they\r\nturn yellow and die. Mesquite grass and strawberries seem to be the only\r\ncrops that will live, and they do not do at all well. Sorrel grows\r\nabundantly in the natural state.\r\n\r\nApparently the reclaimed land which you speak of needs liming to\r\novercome the acidity in the soil. Common builders' lime applied at the\r\nrate of 1000 pounds to the acre at the beginning of the rainy season\r\nought to make the land much more productive and the soil, at the same\r\ntime, more friable. Deep plowing with aeration will also help the land,\r\nand this treatment can begin at once if the soil is workable. Other\r\nadditions of lime can be made later as they may be required to make the\r\nimprovement permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving Uncovered Subsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best treatment for spots that have been scraped in leveling\r\nfor irrigation?\r\n\r\nThe land can be improved by plowing deeply and turning in stable manure\r\nor green alfalfa or any other vegetable matter which may decay,\r\nrendering the soil rich in humus and more friable. Of course, it will\r\ntake some time to accomplish this improvement, and it is necessary that\r\nthere be moisture enough present to cause the material to decay in order\r\nthat the improvement may be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSand for Clay Soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill beach sand do adobe or clay soil any good? It gets hard at times\r\nand I thought that if I was to put beach sand in the ground the salt in\r\nthe sand would do the ground harm.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly desirable to mix sand with heavy soil for the purpose of\r\nmaking it lighter - that is, better drained and more friable and\r\ntherefore improving it for the growth of plants. Sometimes beach sand\r\ncontains a good deal of salt, which, however, is readily removed by\r\nfresh water, and sand hauled and exposed to the rains rapidly loses any\r\nexcess of salt it may contain. Probably with such an amount of sand as\r\nyou are likely to use to mix with your adobe, there is no danger at all\r\nfrom salt. Even if such sand should contain considerable salt, if\r\napplied at the beginning of the rainy season it would be so quickly\r\ndistributed as to not constitute a menace to the growth of plants. The\r\nworst adobe can be transformed into a most beautiful garden soil by the\r\napplication of sand and stable manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlowing from or Towards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the proper way to plow an orchard? First to plow to the trees\r\nand then to plow from them, or to plow from the trees and then to them,\r\nand your reasons? I have had many arguments with my neighbor farmers.\r\n\r\nThere is difference of opinion everywhere as to whether the first\r\nplowing should be toward or away from the trees. In places where the\r\nsoil is pretty heavy and the rainfall is apt to be quite large, plowing\r\ntoward the trees and opening a dead furrow near the center seems to\r\npromote rapid distribution of surplus water. If the rainfall is less and\r\narrangements for deep penetration are more necessary, the plowing can\r\nwell be away from the trees, so as to direct the water toward the row.\r\nIt is, of course, exceedingly important in this case, that the land\r\nshould be worked back before it has a chance to dry out by exposure and\r\nthis is one of the chief objections to the practice, because one is apt\r\nto let the land lie away from the trees, hoping for a late rain which\r\nmay not come. Whatever theoretical advantages there may be in either of\r\nthese methods, they can only be secured by the greatest care to avoid\r\nthe dangers which attend them. This uncertainty is the reason why people\r\nso generally disagree as to which is the best practice, and they are\r\nright in disagreeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Plowing and Sowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI dry-plowed my grain field to a depth averaging seven inches; it turned\r\nup very rough. I then disked and harrowed it, but it is still very\r\nrough. I intended to drill the seed, wait for sufficient rain, and\r\nharrow to a satisfactory condition, but have been advised to put no\r\nimplement on after the drill, as a harrow would spoil the work done by\r\nthe drill, and a slab or roller would cause the ground to bake. If I\r\nwait for rain to work the soil before drilling, it will bring the\r\nseeding too late.\r\n\r\nYou have probably done a pretty good job of dry work. If the land is\r\nstill too rough for the drill, we should broadcast and harrow again. It\r\nis not desirable to harrow after the drill, and to roll or rub is likely\r\nto smooth too much, because the land would bake or crust after the heavy\r\nrains. This would cause loss of moisture and it is therefore better to\r\nleave the surface a little rough. You can roll lightly after the grain\r\nis up, if the surface seems to need closing a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtesian Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a large tract of adobe soil, a black clay top soil. For about\r\nfive months in the year there is not sufficient water on the place. I\r\nhave sunk wells in different parts, but with very poor results, the\r\nfurther we went down the drier and harder the soil got. What little\r\nwater we did obtain was unfit for domestic use. Can you give me an idea\r\nas to what might be the result of an artesian well in such soil?\r\n\r\nArtesian water has nothing to do with the soils. It is a deeper\r\nproposition than that. Artesian water comes from gravel strata overlaid\r\nwith impervious layers of rock or clay in such a way that water in the\r\ngravel is under pressure because the gravel leads up and away to some\r\npoint where water is poured into it by rain falling or snow melting on\r\nmountain or high plateau. As the water cannot get out of this gravel\r\nuntil you punch a hole in its lid, its effort will be to shoot up to\r\nsomething less than the elevation at which it gained entrance to this\r\ngravel - as soon as your puncture gives it a chance. Geologists who know\r\nthe locality may be able to tell you that you have little or no chance,\r\nbut no one can tell you whether you have a good chance or not until he\r\nhas tested the matter by boring. The quality of the artesian water is\r\ndetermined by its distant source and the bad water you have found is\r\ntherefore no indication of the quality of what may be below it. No one\r\nshould enter an artesian undertaking, except to tap a stratum of known\r\ndepth, without a long purse. Probably one in a thousand of the bores\r\nmade into the crust of the earth yields as many gallons of artesian\r\nwater as gallons of various liquids used in boring it - and yet some of\r\nthem are good wells to pump from because they pierce other strata\r\ncarrying water, but not under pressure causing it to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am advised that in some cases alkali may be drained and that in others\r\nit is treated with gypsum.\r\n\r\nGypsum is not a cure for alkali, but simply a means of transforming\r\nblack alkali into white, which is less corrosive and therefore less\r\ndestructive to plants, but there may be easily too much white alkali\r\npresent - so much that the land would be made sterile by it. You cannot\r\nremove alkali by flooding unless two conditions can be assured: first,\r\nthat the water itself is free from alkali before application to the\r\nland; second, that you underdrain the land at a depth of from three to\r\nfour feet with tile, so that the fresh water on the surface can flow\r\nthrough the soil into the drains, carrying away from the land the\r\nalkali, which it dissolves in its course. To flood land even with fresh\r\nwater without making arrangements for carrying off the alkali water\r\nbelow, is to increase the alkali on the surface as the water evaporates,\r\nand such treatment does land injury rather than benefit. We cannot give\r\nyou any estimate as to the cost of washing out. It depends altogether\r\nupon local conditions: whether you use hand work or machinery for the\r\nditching, and what your water will cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlkali, Gypsum and Shade Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly advise how to apply gypsum, and how much, to heavy, sticky soil,\r\nthe worst sort of adobe and heavily saturated with alkali. We want to\r\nplant shade trees. Eucalyptus and peppers succeed fairly well after once\r\nstarted. Gypsum seems to help, but I don't know how much to use.\r\n\r\nThe amount of gypsum required to neutralize black alkali depends upon\r\nhow much black alkali there is to be neutralized, and no definite\r\namount, therefore, can be prescribed beforehand as sufficient without a\r\ndetermination of the amount of alkali. In some experiments gypsum to the\r\namount of thirty tons to the acre or more has been used just for the\r\npurpose of seeing how much the land would take, and a fine growth of\r\ngrain has been secured after using that much gypsum, but that, of\r\ncourse, would be out of the question because the outlay would be more\r\nthan the land or the crop would be worth.\r\n\r\nIn the planting of trees at some distance apart, the tree can be\r\nprotected from destruction and enabled to make a stand in the soil by\r\nusing gypsum on the spot rather than the treatment of the whole surface.\r\nIn this way five or ten pounds of gypsum could be used by mixing with\r\nthe soil to fill a good-sized hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution of Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am told by all the ranchers on the east and south sides of the valley\r\nthat their wells are excellent. But they all say that on the west side -\r\nthey are bringing up alkali. One also said that the water level was\r\nrising throughout all the valley. Is it safe to depend on this in part,\r\nor will the alkali spread over all the valley and the foothills?\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to find people who predict the rise of alkali almost\r\nanywhere except on their own premises. No one can exactly tell where\r\nalkali will go, because no one has complete knowledge of the water\r\nmovement in underlying strata. Wherever the ground water rises on lower\r\nlevels because of irrigation on higher levels there is danger of the\r\nrising of the alkali, for which the only cure is underdrainage with tile\r\nso that this rising water is carried to an outflow and not allowed to\r\napproach within three or four feet of the surface. If you have such an\r\noutflow and desire to undertake the expense of tiling, you can insure\r\nyourself against a serious rise of alkali indefinitely. We do not see,\r\nhowever, how alkali can rise to the higher lands of the valley. Its\r\nfirst effect would be to make lakes or ponds in the lowest parts of the\r\nvalley, and even then the surrounding mesa lands would not be injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants Will Tell About Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give information as to the application of gypsum to my soil which\r\nis somewhat alkaline. I do not care to have an analysis made of my soil,\r\nand believe that you can advise me without it.\r\n\r\nIf your soil is too alkaline for the growth of plants you can\r\ndemonstrate that fact by experiment, or if it is capable of being used\r\nby the application of gypsum, that also can be determined by experiment\r\nand noting the behavior of the same plants afterwards. It is rather a\r\nslow process but it is sure enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLitmus and Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any simple soil test for alkali that can be made without a\r\nchemical analysis?\r\n\r\nYou can ascertain the presence of alkali by using red litmus paper,\r\nwhich will be turned blue by the alkali in the soil, if the soil is\r\nmoist enough. This does not determine the amount of alkali, but the\r\nquickness of the turning to the blue color and the depth of the color\r\nare both attained when the alkali is very strong. When there is less\r\nalkali, the reaction is slower and weaker. This test, however, gives you\r\nonly a rough idea whether the soil is suitable for growing plants. You\r\ncan tell that better by the appearance of the plants which you find. Any\r\ndruggist can furnish the litmus paper, and give you a demonstration of\r\nhow it acts on contact with alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Gypsum for Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better, to kill the black alkali in the soil with gypsum, just to\r\nscatter it over an alkalied spot or to plow the soil first and then use\r\nthe gypsum? I am going to sow alfalfa.\r\n\r\nUse the gypsum after plowing, for it will wet down more quickly, and the\r\ngypsum has to be dissolved to act freely. The best way to cure your spot\r\nis to run an underdrain into it, if possible, so the rain-water can run\r\nthrough the soil freely and take the alkali with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlasting or Tiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn planting trees where hardpan is four feet from the surface is it\r\nnecessary to blast the hardpan, or is there no benefit derived by the\r\nblasting?\r\n\r\nIf there should be a good available soil under a shallow layer of\r\nhardpan, which you say is four feet from the surface, it might be of\r\nconsiderable advantage to bore into the hardpan and explode a dynamite\r\ncartridge in it. But if your good soil is really only four feet deep and\r\nhardpan continuous below, the blast might cause fissures which would\r\nprevent standing water in the upper stratum. If you are sure of four\r\nfeet of good soil above the hardpan you will have no difficulty in\r\ngrowing good trees, if you get the moisture just right and the hardpan\r\nslopes in such a way that surplus moisture will move away. If, however,\r\nyou have hardpan at different depths on the tract, so that it may really\r\nmake basins which will hold water, you are likely to have trouble from\r\naccumulations of water which will not only prevent the roots extending\r\nto the full depths of the soil, but will also cause some trees to die.\r\nSuch a danger could be removed by draining the soil to a depth of three\r\nand a half or four feet with tile, in order to prevent accumulations at\r\nany point. This would be expensive perhaps, but you would be sure that\r\nyou had rendered your four feet of soil safe and available. If you trust\r\nto blasting you will have to wait several years for the trees to tell\r\nyou whether you helped them or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Blasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land which is underlaid with hardpan two or three feet deep and\r\nthis in turn is underlaid with sand or sandpan. What I would like\r\nto know is whether blasting the holes before setting trees would allow\r\nmore moisture coming from this sandpan, or, rather, what effect it would\r\nhave as to moisture.\r\n\r\nWe do not know. It might make the soil better for the trees by allowing\r\nescape for surplus water through previous layers. It might allow the\r\ntree to root more deeply for moisture in those strata. It might allow\r\nwater to rise from such strata if they have water under pressure. It\r\nmight do other things good or bad, according to conditions prevailing\r\nunder the hardpan. If you are to irrigate the land the effects would\r\nprobably be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sub-soil Plow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am contemplating using a sub-soil plow for the purpose of breaking\r\nplow-sole on grain land. This is about 4 1/2 inches below the surface\r\nand is about 5 inches thick. This soil is comparatively loose and seems\r\nto be of good quality. Do you think that the sub-soil plow run low\r\nenough to break this plow-sole will benefit the land?\r\n\r\nThere can be no question about the benefit of breaking up this tight\r\nstratum, provided you use a long-tooth harrow or a subsoil packer\r\nafterward to reduce the land so that it will not be too open to loss of\r\nmoisture by too free circulation of air. The best way to treat such a\r\nsoil would be to use a tractor and plow to a full foot of depth, for\r\nthis, followed by good harrowing, would disintegrate the hard stuff and\r\ncommingle it with the loose surface soil and make it somewhat more\r\nretentive - doing this when the moisture is just right for\r\ndisintegration and mixing. If you are not ready to go to this expense, a\r\nsubsoiler, following the plow with another team, would put your land in\r\nbetter shape for dry farming or for irrigation than it is now. Starting\r\nlate, however, might give you less crop the first year on such deep\r\nworking than by shallow plowing if the year's rainfall should be scant.\r\nIt would, however, be a good start for summer-fallowing and a big crop\r\nthe next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSour Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is \"sour\" soil? Is that the name by which it is commonly known, and\r\nwhat is the treatment for it?\r\n\r\nSour soil is soil in which an acid is developed by plant decay and\r\nexclusion of air. The proper treatment is the application of lime, and\r\naeration by open tillage and underdrainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Plaster for Sour Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan house plaster be used in reclaiming sour ground and how much per\r\nacre? The ground produces some sour grass - not a great deal. The\r\nplaster is from an old building that is being torn down.\r\n\r\nHouse plaster is desirable as an application to land which is sour. It\r\nalso adds to the mellowness of land which is hard, because of the sand\r\ncontained in it. It has always been considered a good dressing for\r\ngarden land. So far as the correction of sourness goes, it is much less\r\nactive than fresh lime, but it acts in the same way to a limited extent.\r\nIt is certainly worth using, providing it does not cost too much for\r\ndelivery, and can be freely used if the land is heavy and needs\r\nfriability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Manure Ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving recently got a lot of manure plentifully supplied with redwood\r\nshavings that had been used with the bedding, and being afraid to use\r\nthe same in that shape, as it takes such a long time for the wood to\r\nrot, I reduced the pile to a heap of ashes. How can it be best applied\r\nto ornamental trees and shrubbery in a light gravelly soil?\r\n\r\nYou have done unwisely in burning the manure. We would have taken the\r\nrisk of a single use of shavings for the sake of the manurial matter\r\nassociated with them, and this risk of too much lightening of a gravelly\r\nsoil would be especially small in connection with deep rooting plants\r\nlike ornamental trees and shrubbery. You have left merely the skeleton\r\nof the manure, and much of that of doubtful solubility, if the\r\ntemperature ran very high by burning in a mass. You need not be fearful\r\nabout using these ashes. Scatter or spread them over the ground just as\r\nyou would have spread the manure, let the rains dissolve and carry down\r\nwhat they can and go on with your usual methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Best Fertilizer for Sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I best fertilize soil that is pure sand?\r\n\r\nThe best fertilizer for pure sand is well-rotted stable manure,  because\r\nit not only supplies all kinds of plant food, but increases the humus in\r\nthe soil, which is exceedingly important in making the sand more\r\nretentive of moisture as well as more productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizers in Tree Holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be harmful to add 2 or 3 pounds of steamed bone meal to the\r\nhole of a young tree just before planting?\r\n\r\nThere would be no injury, providing you mix it with a considerable\r\namount of soil by digging over the bottom of the hole, but our\r\nconviction is that on lands which are good enough for the commercial\r\nplanting of fruit trees, it is not necessary to stimulate a young tree\r\nin this way, but that it is better to postpone the use of fertilizers\r\nuntil the trees come into bearing and show the desirability of more\r\nliberal feeding. Of course, if young trees do not make satisfactory\r\ngrowth, they may be stimulated either with some kind of a fertilizer or\r\nwith a freer use of water, and it is generally the latter that they are\r\nchiefly in need of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWood Ashes and Tomatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any harm to vegetable growing to dig sufficient of wood ashes\r\nin for mellowing heavy soil? My tomato plants grew splendidly this year,\r\nbut the fruits were all rough and wrinkled. I gave them plenty of horse\r\nand poultry manure at planting and plenty of wood ashes and falling\r\nleaves of cypress later.\r\n\r\nWood ashes do not mellow a heavy soil. The effect of the potash is to\r\novercome the granular structure and increase compactness. Coal ashes,\r\nbecause they are coarser in particles and devoid of potash, do promote\r\nmellowness, and are valuable mechanically on a heavy soil although they\r\ndo not contain appreciable amounts of plant food. You are overfeeding\r\nyour tomato plants, probably. The chances are that you had poor seed.\r\nThere is no best tomato, because you ought to grow early and late kinds:\r\nthere is also some difference in the behavior of varieties in different\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas It the Potash or the Water?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year the lye from the prune dipper was turned on the ground near\r\ntwo almond trees which seemed to be dying, and to my surprise they have\r\ntaken a new lease of life. Hence my conclusion that potash was good for\r\nour soil.\r\n\r\nYour experience seems to justify the application of potash, surely, but\r\nthe question still remains, how much good the potash did the trees, and\r\nhow much they needed the extra water which the waste dips supplied. It\r\nwould be desirable for you to make another experiment with other trees,\r\napplying wood ashes, if you have them, or about four pounds per tree of\r\nthe potash which you use for dipping, scattering well and working it\r\ninto the soil after it is moistened by the rains, and not using any more\r\nwater than the trees ordinarily received from rainfall. After this trial\r\nyou will be in a position to know whether your trees need potash or\r\nirrigation - by comparing with other trees adjacent. Besides are you\r\nsure that your lye dip was caustic potash and not caustic soda? The\r\nlatter has no fertilizing value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrunings as Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs orchard and vineyard brush worth enough as a fertilizer to pay for\r\ncutting or breaking and putting back on the land?\r\n\r\nWe should say not. It takes too much labor to put it in any form to\r\npromote decay, and is even then too indestructible. It is also possible\r\nthat its decay may induce root rot of trees. We should burn the stuff\r\nand spread the ashes. Vineyard prunings are more promising because more\r\neasily and quickly reduced by decay. Vinecane-hashers have been proposed\r\nfrom time to time, but we do not know anyone who long used them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsum on Grain Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any profit in sowing gypsum on grain land, say on wheat or oat\r\ncrop? At what stage should it be applied and in what quantity?\r\n\r\nIt would have a tendency to make the surface more friable and therefore\r\nbetter for moisture retention, and it could be used at the rate of 1000\r\npounds to the acre, broadcasted before plowing for grain. As our soils\r\nare, however, usually well supplied with lime, there is a question\r\nwhether there would be any profit in the use of gypsum, for, aside from\r\nlime, it contains no plant food, although it does act rather\r\nenergetically upon other coil contents. Gypsum is a tonic and not a\r\nfertilizer from that point of view. The best way to satisfy yourself of\r\nits effect would be to try a small area, marked so as you could note its\r\nbehavior as compared with the rest of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsum and Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is gypsum composed of? Is it detrimental to land in future years?\r\nHave the lands of California any black alkali in them? I notice my\r\nneighbors who sow gypsum on their alfalfa get a very much better yield\r\nof hay than those who do not.\r\n\r\nGypsum is sulphate of lime. It is not detrimental to the land in after\r\nyears except that its action is to render immediately available other\r\nplant foods and this may render the land poorer - not by the addition of\r\nanything that is injurious but by the quicker using up of plant food\r\nwhich it already contains. Black alkali is very common in California in\r\nalkali lands. In lands which show their quality by good cropping, there\r\nis no reason to apprehend black alkali nor to use gypsum to prevent its\r\noccurrence. The use of gypsum does stimulate the growth of alfalfa and\r\nmakes its product greater just as you observe in the experience of your\r\nneighbors, but the more they use up the land now the less they will have\r\nlater, unless they resort to regular fertilization to restore what has\r\nbeen exhausted. But even that may be a good business proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Gypsum Does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI intend to fertilize alfalfa and should like to know about gypsum. I\r\nhave heard it stimulates the growth temporarily but in three or four\r\nyears hurts the land. I have heavy land.\r\n\r\nThe functions of gypsum are: (a) to supply lime when the soil lacks it;\r\n(b) to make a heavy soil more mellow, and (c) to act upon other soil\r\nsubstances to render them more available for plant food. These are some\r\nof the soil aspects of gypsum; it may have plant aspects also. It is too\r\nmuch to say that gypsum hurts the land; it does, however, help the plant\r\nto more quickly exhaust its fertility, and in this respect is not like\r\nthe direct plant foods which comprise the true fertilizers - one of\r\nwhich gypsum is not. It might be best for your pocketbook and for the\r\nmechanical condition of the soil to use it, but do not think that it is\r\nmaintaining the fertility of the land (a service which we expect from\r\nthe true fertilizers) except as it may supply a possible deficiency of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Gypsum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much per acre, how frequently and what seasons of the year are the\r\nbest time to apply gypsum?\r\n\r\nOf gypsum on alkali, we should begin at the rate of one ton to the acre\r\nand repeat the application as frequently as necessary to achieve the\r\ndesired result. If the alkali was quite strong we would use twice as\r\nmuch. Without reference to an alkaline condition in the soil, and to\r\ngive heavy soil a more friable character, which promotes cultivation,\r\naeration, etc., and, therefore, ministers to more successful production,\r\nhalf a ton to the acre can be used, applications to be repeated as\r\nconditions seem to warrant it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWood Ashes in the Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is available in my neighborhood a free supply of wood ashes. Can\r\nyou tell me how best to distribute the same in a garden (flowers and\r\ngarden truck), and what, if any, treatment is to be given the ashes for\r\nthe best results.\r\n\r\nWood ashes long exposed to rain lose most of their valuable contents,\r\nand leached ashes are only of small value. If they are fresh ashes or\r\nashes which have been kept dry, they are chiefly valuable for potash,\r\nwhich is good in its way, but not all that a plant needs. If, however,\r\nyour soil is shy of potash, the use of ashes will notably improve growth\r\nif not applied in excess in the caustic form in which it occurs in the\r\nashes. They require no treatment. Spread, say, a quarter of an inch\r\nthickness all over the ground and dig in deeply. It may also help you by\r\ndestruction of wire worms and other ground pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal Ashes in the Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of coal ashes on the red clay soil of Redlands or\r\nwood and coal ashes combined?\r\n\r\nCoal ashes are exceedingly desirable upon clay land because their\r\nmechanical mixture with the fine particles of the clay renders the soil\r\nmore friable, permeable and better adapted to the growth of most plants.\r\nCoal ashes, however, possess no fertilizing value - their action is\r\nmerely mechanical. The wood ashes which may be combined with them are\r\ndesirable as a source of potash which most plants require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiming a Chicken Yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a small family orchard of half an acre, fenced in as a chicken\r\nyard, the soil of which has become very foul. When would be the best\r\ntime to apply lime and how much?\r\n\r\nPut on 500 pounds of lime and plow under as soon as you can - that is,\r\nspread the lime just before the plowing, with a shower or two on the\r\nlime before plowing, if the weather runs that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGive directions for using chicken manure. For use of young trees, is\r\nthere any difference in treatment of deciduous and citrus trees? For use\r\nin the vegetable garden and the flower garden, what should be mixed with\r\nit and in what proportions? So many people say poultry manure is so\r\nstrong, I am afraid to use it.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that poultry manure, free from earth, contains even as high\r\nas four times as much plant food as ordinary stable manure. It is,\r\ntherefore, to be used with proportional care, so that the plants shall\r\nnot receive too much, and particularly so that there may not be too much\r\ncollected in one place. Probably the best way to guard against this is\r\nto thoroughly mix the manure with three or four times its bulk of\r\nordinary garden soil and then use this mixture at about the same rate\r\nyou would stable manure. If you do not desire to go to all this trouble,\r\nmake an even scattering of the manure and work it into the soil. There\r\nis no reason to fear the material; simply guard against the unwise use\r\nof it. It is good for all the plants which you mention; in fact, for any\r\nplant grown, provided it is sparingly and evenly distributed.\r\n\r\nIt should be pulverized so that there shall not be lumps and masses in\r\nthe same place for fear of root injury. Of course, the strength depends\r\nupon how much earth is gathered up with the manure. Sometimes there is\r\nso much waste material that it can be handled just as ordinary farm\r\nmanure is.\r\n\r\nWe should not use over 20 pounds of clean droppings to a young tree and\r\nshould mix it with the soil for a considerable distance around the tree.\r\nOld bearing trees might stand two or three tons to the acre if\r\ndistributed all over the ground. The material contains everything that\r\nis necessary for the growth of the tree and formation of the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAshes and Poultry Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that ashes mixed with chicken manure is not good. I use ashes\r\naltogether on the drop boards because I can keep the boards cleaner. The\r\nrefuse is then scattered around the fruit trees.\r\n\r\nWood ashes and lime should never be used as you propose, because they\r\nset free the nitrogen compounds which are the most valuable content of\r\npoultry manures. This action is conditioned largely upon the presence of\r\nmoisture, and if the droppings are kept dry and hurried into the soil\r\nthe loss is lessened. Coal ashes, on the other hand, are a thoroughly\r\ngood absorbent when the coal burns to a fine ash or is sifted. They do\r\nnot act as wood ashes do, because they do not contain soluble alkali.\r\nThey also have a good mellowing effect on heavy soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaustic Lime Not a Good Absorbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould air-slackened lime be suitable to sprinkle over the dropping\r\nboards in hen houses?\r\n\r\nGypsum is greatly superior to air-slacked lime for the hen houses, as it\r\nhas every beneficial effect of the latter, while the air-slacked lime\r\nwill set free much of the fertilizing value of the manure, which the\r\ngypsum will not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToo Much Chicken Manure for Young Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have peach trees and apple trees, 3 to 6 years old, that are very\r\nthrifty but grow only wood. The soil was poor when planting, and I have\r\nput on plenty of sweepings from the chicken-yards. I suppose that is the\r\ncause of the trouble.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly you have overmanured your soil with chicken manure, which is\r\na very strong fertilizer and should only be used in limited quantities.\r\nIn order to counteract any acidity or ill effects which have been\r\nproduced by its excessive application, it would be desirable for you to\r\napply about 500 to 1000 pounds per acre of common builders' lime at the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season, working it into the soil with the fall or\r\nearly winter plowing. Do not cut back the tree during the dormant\r\nseason, although, of course, you may have to remove surplus or\r\ninterfering branches for the sake of shaping the tree. Winter pruning\r\ninduces a greater wood growth during the following summer; therefore, it\r\nshould be avoided under such conditions as you describe. Having adopted\r\nsuch a policy, there is nothing for you to do but to wait for the trees\r\nto slow down and assume a normal bearing habit proper for their ages.\r\nSummer pruning is an offset for excessive wood growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuburban Wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe keep a cow and poultry and have a dry-earth toilet. We have been\r\nburying the manure in the little garden spot or along by the fences or\r\nspreading it out on the alfalfa before it is rotted, but do not get good\r\nresults. How shall we apply it to get the best results ? We have a town\r\nordinance against leaving it in piles to rot.\r\n\r\nYou can compost it in a tight bin made of planks, and using enough water\r\nto prevent too rapid fermentation and loss of valuable ingredients.\r\nDuring the dry season you can probably use enough dry earth or road dust\r\nto render the material inoffensive, and you can also distribute it then\r\nwithout undesirable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComposting Garden Wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou recommend making a compost of all scrapings, garbage, weeds, etc. Is\r\nthere any danger in having this in a pit near the house?\r\n\r\nIf you desire to put garden wastes, including manure, into a pit, the\r\nonly objection would be the heavy work of digging it out again. If you\r\nallow waste water from the house to run into the pit, there would\r\nprobably be not enough dry material to absorb it, and the pit would be\r\nnot only objectionable on account of odors, but possibly dangerous to\r\nhealth. The water would also prevent decomposition, because of exclusion\r\nof air. At the same time, enough moisture to promote slow decomposition\r\nis essential. It is usually more convenient to compost garden wastes on\r\nthe surface of the ground, enclosing them with a plank retainer, because\r\nmoisture can easily be applied with a hose, as desirable, the material\r\ncan be occasionally forked over to promote decay, and the heavy work of\r\ndigging material out of a pit is avoided. Such a collection is neither\r\noffensive nor dangerous if handled right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComposting Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the dry barnyard manure, when heaped up and dampened with water,\r\nmake a valuable fertilizer?\r\n\r\nFor garden use, dry manure in heaps should be dampened with water from\r\ntime to time so as to prevent too active fermentation. Of course, water\r\nshould not be supplied so freely as to cause a leaching of the pile. It\r\nis also desirable that the material should be forked over from time to\r\ntime to distribute moisture and promote decay. When this is done a\r\nthoroughly first-class fertilizer is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarnyard Manure and Alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spots my land is hard and has some black alkali. Will barnyard manure\r\nhelp the hard land if cultivated in?\r\n\r\nUse stable manure because that would not only furnish nitrogen, if your\r\nplants need any more, but it would add coarse material and ultimately\r\nhumus which would overcome the tendency of your soil to become compact\r\nand thus concentrate alkali near the surface by evaporation. Mellow the\r\nsoil, increase the humus, make water movement freer and good cultivation\r\neasier and alkali will become weaker by distribution through a greater\r\nmass of the soil and may be too weak at any point to be troublesome,\r\nunless you have too much to start with. Put on manure at the beginning\r\nof the rainy season and plow it under, with all the green stuff which\r\ngrows upon it, during the winter or early spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStable Manure and Bean Straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the approximate contents of common stable manure; also, how\r\nmuch of the above is contained in bean straw?\r\n\r\nThe composition of mixed stable manure is given as containing in one\r\nton: Nitrogen, 10 pounds; phosphoric acid, 5 pounds; potash, 10 pounds.\r\nThe constituents of bean straw in one ton, are given as: Nitrogen, 28\r\npounds; phosphoric acid, 6 pounds; potash, 38 pounds; Of course, a large\r\npart of the difference in composition is due to the excessive amount of\r\nmoisture which ordinary stable manure contains. Air dried stable manure,\r\nsuch as is found in a California corral, would have much higher\r\nfertilizing value than such moist manure as an Eastern chemist would be\r\nlikely to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoofing a Manure Pit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to roof a manure pit, if the pit is tight so that all\r\nrain on manure is caught in the liquid manure and nothing is lost?\r\n\r\nTo secure satisfactory composting of stable manures in a pit it is\r\nnecessary to be able to regulate the moisture of the mass. If it becomes\r\ntoo dry, too rapid fermentation takes place and the material is\r\ndestroyed by what is called fire-fanging. If too much liquid enters the\r\npit, so that the material is submerged, the air is excluded and\r\nfermentation stops. For these reasons it is necessary that a pit in the\r\nregion of large rainfall be covered, and water be used from a hose or\r\nother source of supply in just sufficient quantity to keep the material\r\nright for slow fermentation. How much water should be added to bring the\r\nmoisture to a right condition depends upon how much liquid waste runs\r\ninto the pit, and where water is used for cleaning a stable care has to\r\nbe taken that the pit is not submerged. Success with a pit is,\r\ntherefore, conditioned on the amount of moisture admitted, and this\r\ncannot be controlled unless the pit has a cover fit to shed rainfall. Of\r\ncourse, it may be adjustable so that some rainfall may be admitted as\r\nmay be desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValue of Animals in Manure.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of our fruit and dairy ranch we have the manure from\r\nsome forty head of horses and cattle, which is distributed over the\r\nplace. We cut our alfalfa and feed it and do very little pasturing. In\r\norder to give our dairy the proper credit, we would kindly ask what you\r\nconsider a fair price for the manure of a cow for one year. Also what\r\nwould the manure from a horse for one year be worth?\r\n\r\nA compilation of a considerable number of weighings, analyses and\r\nvaluations in Europe, cited by Prof. Roberts in his book on the\r\n\"Fertility of the Land,\" gives an average value of the voidings of a cow\r\nfor a year as $32.25 and of a horse at $24.06. This is based, of course,\r\nupon the collection and saving of all excrements which is never secured\r\nexcept in careful experimentation. The value of manure depends upon the\r\nquality of the feed. In two experiments, considered a safe substitute\r\nfor the straw, apart from the fact that the gave a value in manure of $1\r\nper ton of hay fed; cows fed on clover and bran gave value in manure of\r\n3.80 per ton of mixed feed. Your alfalfa feeding would approach the\r\nhigher value. You will have to make an estimate from the above data to\r\nserve your purpose and you can figure it either by the number of animals\r\nor by the tonnage of the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValue of Fresh and Dry Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the relative value of the weekly or semi-weekly corral scrapings\r\nwhich are tramped fine and air-dried; and of the fresh, wet manure from\r\nthe stable? I do not understand that the latter has appreciable water\r\nadded, and the amount of sand in the corral scrapings would be small.\r\n\r\nFresh, mixed animal manure is usually calculated to contain about 75 per\r\ncent of water. Manure which has been quickly dried, without fermentation\r\nand without leaching by rains, may be worth four or five times as much\r\nper ton. Nothing, however, short of analysis would determine the value\r\nof any particular lot, for that depends somewhat upon the way the\r\nanimals are fed, as well as upon the moisture content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShavings in Stable Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs barnyard fertilizer containing shavings instead of straw, desirable?\r\n\r\nBarnyard manure containing shavings is chiefly objectionable because of\r\nthe amount of inert material. The shavings are exceedingly slow to\r\ndecompose, and in light soil in considerable quantities would cause a\r\nserious loss of moisture. If applied, on the other hand, to a heavy soil\r\nand accompanied by sufficient irrigation water, the effect of making the\r\nsoil more friable might be very desirable. It depends then upon\r\ncircumstances whether shavings can be concited by Prof. Snyder in his\r\n\"Soils and Fertilizers,\" cows fed on hay straw is more valuable not only\r\nbecause more easily decomposed, but because its content of plant food is\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Grape Pomace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of grape pomace, would not the large value shown by analysis\r\nbe chiefly in the seeds? My observation is that these are exceedingly\r\nslow to became available in the soil. Would composting break down the\r\nshell of the seed?\r\n\r\nGrape pomace is slowly available because of the slow disintegration you\r\nmention. It could be hastened by drying and grinding, but we doubt if\r\nthis or other treatment would return its cost. Decay by moisture\r\npromoted by composting with manure, kept at a low temperature by\r\ncontinuous moisture would render it sooner available, but this would\r\ninvolve labor which, at our wage rates, would probably make the material\r\ncost more than it is worth. This is probably a cost in which time is\r\ncheaper than money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSheep and Goat Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can buy goat manure from an inclosure where this is deposited to an\r\namount of about five carloads. Will goat manure be of great value in\r\nfertilizing an orchard? If so, how much of it should be spread an an\r\nacre?\r\n\r\nAccumulations of sheep and goat manure in a dry situation, that is,\r\nwhere not leached out by heavy rainfall, have been found to run as high\r\nas $13 per ton in fertilizing constituents. The average would, however,\r\nbe not above $7.50, and would depend not only upon the unleached\r\ncondition of the material but upon the amount of sand mixed with it. If\r\nit is in a situation where sand blows very freely, it might not be worth\r\nover $4 or $5 per ton, possibly not that much. You have, therefore, to\r\ndeal with a condition largely unknown. So far as its fertilizing quality\r\ngoes, however, it is freely available and directly calculated to\r\nstimulate the growth of plants, and probably four or five tons could be\r\nused to the acre without injury if well distributed over the surface of\r\nthe land. Application can be made at any time of the year, for the\r\ndrying will not injure it. It will not, however, become available until\r\nthe soil is sufficiently moist to carry its contents to the roots of the\r\nplants. Under ordinary conditions in California, application should be\r\nmade just before the beginning of the rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHog Manure and Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the fertilizing value of hog manure, and also what is the best\r\nfertilizer to use for potatoes? Our potatoes are planted early in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nHog manure is rather a rank and strong fertilizer, usually very rich,\r\nalthough the quality of it depends upon how well the hogs have been fed\r\n- that from grain-fed hogs being notably better. The valuation of hog\r\nmanure ranges from $2.50 to $3.25 per ton, according to the feeding as\r\nnoted, while ordinary stable manure may be worth from $2 to $2.75 per\r\nton. It is not a good idea to apply these organic manures directly for\r\nthe growth of potatoes. It is better to apply them to the land for the\r\ngrowth of a grain or forage crop, plowing in the stubble and using the\r\nland for potatoes the following year. If you wish to fertilize directly\r\nfor potatoes, the use of a commercial fertilizer containing a good\r\namount of potash would be a better proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizer for Sweet Potatoes and Melons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have sandy soil that has been used for sweet potatoes until it is worn\r\nout for that crop, and would like your advice as to the best fertilizer\r\nto use. Also, what fertilizer would be best for melons on land that has\r\nbeen planted to melons for the past three years?\r\n\r\nThere is not much difference in the plant food required by the two crops\r\nyou mention, but both evidently need a freshened soil and an increase of\r\nhumus. We should apply a half ton to the acre of a complete fertilizer,\r\nof which any dealer can give you descriptions and prices. If you wish to\r\ndo a good job, start a growth of peas or vetches or burr clover, and sow\r\nthe fertilizer evenly with the seed. Plow the growth under in February\r\nand roll (as the soil is sandy) to close down and promote the decay of\r\nthe green stuff, which ought to be so well accomplished by the date that\r\nit is safe to plant sweet potatoes or melons that it will give no\r\ntrouble in summer cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Abuse of Grape Pomace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got in an argument with a neighbor of mine who stated that grape\r\npomace is not a fertilizer. Is it so? My neighbor says that two years\r\nago he had two apricot trees in his yard, and they were fine bearing and\r\nhealthy trees. After making his wine he put the pomace on the ground and\r\nthey died. Could that be the cause?\r\n\r\nYes, probably. He used too much fresh pomace and the resulting\r\nfermentation of its products may have killed the trees. But grape\r\npomace, after going through fermentation and in the process of decay,\r\nmakes humus in addition to giving potash and other desirable substances\r\nto the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManuring Vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes barnyard manure have any injurious effect on the vines if applied\r\non my vineyard? One of my neighbors claims barnyard manure burned his\r\nvines so he got no crop wherever he spread the manure, and nothing would\r\nnow induce him to use it again.\r\n\r\nBarnyard manure can be safely used in a vineyard at the beginning of the\r\nrainy season, working it in with the plowing, but not using too much.\r\nWine grapes are sometimes injuriously affected in flavor by the use of\r\nsuch fertilizer, but the growth of the vine itself can be stimulated by\r\nthe rational use of it. Your neighbor apparently either used too much or\r\nmade the application at the beginning of the dry season or made some\r\nother mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBones for Grape Vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to plant out some grape vines, and would like to know if it\r\nis a good plan to put old bones, broken up fine, into the holes when\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nYes, if you do not use too much and it is mixed with earth, a little\r\nbeyond the touch of the roots at planting. You do not need to finely\r\nbreak the bones. The roots will take care of that. But do not put in too\r\nmuch coarse stuff, for fear of causing too rapid drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviving Blighted Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a couple of apple trees here that were hurt by the pear blight\r\nthree years ago and were cut back since then; they come out each year,\r\nbut the leaves curl up, and they do not do anything. I would like to\r\nknow if putting any fertilizer around them would help them to put out\r\ntheir leaves, and if so what I should use?\r\n\r\nPut some stable manure on the top of the soil around your trees now so\r\nthat the rains may reach the contents of the soil, then later in the\r\nseason dig the manure into the soil. Apply water during the summer time\r\nand this will encourage the trees to grow, if there is any vigor\r\nremaining in them. This treatment, however, will not protect them from\r\nthe blight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Pear Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have pear trees 15 years old which have fruited heavily for years and\r\nhave never been fertilized. What is the best fertilizer for the soil\r\nwhich is heavy, and when is the best time to apply it? I intend planting\r\nrye to plow under in the spring, but thought possibly the fertilizer\r\nshould be applied first.\r\n\r\nIf you have stable manure available, nothing could be better for the\r\nfeeding of the trees and for its mellowing effect upon your heavy soil.\r\nApplication can be made at once, to be worked into the land when the rye\r\nis sown. It will help the trees and give you more rye which in the end\r\nwill help the trees. If you have no stable manure available, what is\r\ncalled by the dealers a \"complete fertilizer\" for orchard purposes is\r\nwhat you should use and apply it when you work the land for rye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best means of fertilizing an olive orchard? My orchard gives\r\nme a perfect quality of oil, but a poor quantity. My soil is dry\r\ncalcareous, red and gray, and is very thin in places, therefore, it\r\nlacks moisture.\r\n\r\nAn olive orchard can be fertilized with stable manure or with a\r\n\"complete fertilizer,\" or with the special brands of different\r\nmanufacturers of special fruit fertilizers. But you must be sure that\r\nyour trees do not need moisture more than they need fertilizers, for\r\nwithout adequate moisture fertilizers cannot do their best work. The\r\nincrease of the humus content of the soil, either secured by stable\r\nmanure or by the plowing under of winter-grown cover crops, is\r\ndesirable, as they not only give the trees more plant food, but make the\r\nsoil also more retentive of moisture. You will have to experiment along\r\nthis line to see just what is best for your trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsult the Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I send you a little soil out of my one-year-old pear orchard so that\r\nyou can advise me what I can do to improve its fertility. The trees are\r\nfairly thrifty, but as fruit growing is my pleasure I wish to make it a\r\nmodel orchard and add whatever it requires of nitrogen, humus, etc.,\r\nimmediately so as to increase the growth for this summer. Next winter I\r\nintend to put manure around them and cultivate about every other month.\r\n\r\nCareful experimenting with fertilizers will teach you more than analysis\r\nwould do, because the behavior of the tree under various conditions\r\ntells you more than a chemist possibly could. Besides, we are of the\r\nconviction that on good soils young fruit trees should not be pushed\r\nbeyond the growth which they would naturally make with a regular and\r\nadequate moisture supply. Be careful about using fertilizers on young\r\ntrees, either in the summer or in the winter. When they come to bearing\r\nage and yield large crops of fruit, that is another question. Any\r\nCalifornia soil which will not grow young fruit trees thriftily should\r\nnot be used for orchard purposes unless an amateur desires to grow trees\r\non a picturesque lot of rocks or sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of Fertilizing Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have 100 acres in olives about six miles northeast of Rialto in San\r\nBernardino county. In 1908 we got about five tons from the 100 acres. We\r\nbegan fertilizing and cultivating in 1909, and have put on the 100 acres\r\nabout the same amount of fertilizer each year. In 1909 we got 15 tons;\r\nin 1910, 116 tons, and 1911 is estimated at 325 to 350 tons.\r\n\r\nIt is important that your olive trees are responding to good treatment\r\nand fertilization. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be always the\r\ncase and a good many olive trees have been made into firewood because\r\nnothing seemed to bring them into satisfactory bearing. Good bearing\r\nolive trees are now among the very best of our horticultural properties,\r\nwhile non-bearing olive trees are worth about $7 a cord for fire wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNursery Fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have light sandy loam, well drained. It has been in blackberries, and\r\nI now have it planted to nursery fruit tree stock. I have given it this\r\nspring two applications of nitrate of soda, but no other fertilizer.\r\nWill the nitrate act alone, or must I apply also the phosphate and\r\npotash to get results?\r\n\r\nNitrate of soda will act alone and will stimulate growth, and there are\r\ncases in which there is enough phosphate and potash already in the soil\r\nto act with it. Usually, however, it is customary to use a complete\r\nfertilizer containing phosphate and potash as well as nitrogen, in order\r\nthat the plant may be more roundly supplied and promoted, and one would\r\nbe a little safer in using that sort of fertilizer than in relying upon\r\nthe nitrate of soda alone. You will, of course, be careful not to use\r\nthese fertilizers in too large amounts, for nitrate of soda is\r\nespecially dangerous if used in excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond Hulls and Sawdust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any fertilizing value in the hulls of almonds? Would pine\r\nsawdust from the lumber mills be a good substance to mix in and plow\r\nunder in a three-acre adobe patch in order to loosen and lighten the\r\nsoil for truck gardening?\r\n\r\nAlmond hulls have considerable fertilizing value, but they are slow to\r\ndecompose, and, therefore, may be a long time unused by the plant. They\r\nalso have a good feeding value for stock, and if you can expose them in\r\nthe corral so the stock can eat as they like, this is the best way to\r\nget them into fertilizing form. If they can be cheaply ground their\r\navailability as a fertilizer would, of course, be quickened. Redwood\r\nsawdust is better than pine sawdust, but any kind of sawdust can be made\r\nto serve a good purpose in mellowing heavy soils if not used to excess\r\nand if there is plenty of moisture to promote decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an orchard of prunes, apricots and cherries, which has been\r\nbearing since some 30 years ago, without fertilization, except possibly\r\nmuddy sediment from occasional irrigations of mountain streams. Various\r\npeople are advocating the use of nitrates and other fertilizers. Should\r\nI have samples of this earth analyzed in order to ascertain what the\r\nsoil most needs?\r\n\r\nTo find out whether your trees need fertilization, study the tree and\r\nthe product and do not depend upon chemical analysis of the soil. If\r\nyour trees are growing thriftily and have sufficiently goodsized leaves\r\nof good color, and if fruit of good size and quality is obtained, it is\r\nnot necesssary to think of fertilization. If the trees are not\r\nsatisfactory in all these respects, the first thing to do is to\r\ndetermine whether they have moisture enough during the later part of the\r\nsummer. This should be determined by digging or boring to a depth or\r\nthree or four feet in July or August. The subsoil should be reasonably\r\nmoist in order to sustain the tree during the late summer and early fall\r\nwhen strong fruit buds for the coming year will be finished. If you are\r\nsure the moisture supply is ample, then fertilization either with stable\r\nmanure or with commercial fertilizers containing especially nitrates and\r\nphosphates should be undertaken experimentally, in accordance with\r\nsuggestions for application made to you by dealers in these articles,\r\nwho are usually well informed by observation. When you have the tree to\r\nadvise you of the condition of the soil, you do not need a chemist,\r\nalthough if the tree manifests serious distress and is unable to make\r\nsatisfactory growth the suggestions of a chemist may be very helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the general and what do you consider the ideal, manuring, and\r\nwhen applied for orange trees from 15 to 12 years old under irrigation?\r\nI use about 2 cwt. each of superphosphate, nitrate of soda and sulphate\r\nof potash per acre, but am dissatisfied with my yields as compared with\r\nyours in California.\r\n\r\nThere is not only no standard for fertilizing orange trees, but there is\r\nno \"ideal\" which might be considered as a basis for a standard. All\r\ngrowers who are awake to the necessity of doing something for bearing\r\ntrees, try all things and hold fast to what (they think) is good.\r\nPractically none of them has any enduring conviction or demonstration as\r\nto what is good, but they keep on trying. There is, however, one clear\r\nand enduring conviction, and that is, that continuous fertilizing must\r\nbe done for profit, and our best growers are using the same materials\r\nyou mention in considerably larger amounts than you apply, and use also\r\nother forms of nitrogenous fertilizers. The amounts of superphosphate\r\nand nitrate which you use would be considered homeopathic treatment by\r\nour growers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCow Stable Drainage for Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been told that the drainings from a cow barn make an excellent\r\nfertilizer for orange and lemon trees, in fact, anywhere on plants where\r\nmanure is considered beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe drainage from a cow barn is excellent for fertilizing almost any\r\ncrop unless it is used in too large quantity. If it should be combined\r\nwith a considerable amount of water used for cleaning out the stable, it\r\nwould be excellent for the irrigation of all kinds of fruit trees. Care\r\nshould be taken, however, not to oversaturate the ground, which would be\r\nthe case if the washing of the stable was allowed to run continuously\r\nalongside a single row of trees. The water should be changed from row to\r\nrow in succession, cultivating the ground meantime to promote aeration\r\nand to prevent too great compacting of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed Farm Refuse as a Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould cleanings from sweet peas or all kinds of seeds grown on a seed\r\nfarm be of any value as a fertilizer on sandy loam soil for an orchard?\r\nThis has been in a pile for three years or more, and I can get it for\r\nthe hauling. There are a hundred loads or more of it and not very far to\r\nhaul.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth more on a heavy soil, because the danger of drying out\r\nwould be less and the surety of reduction to humus greater. To get the\r\nhighest value from such stuff it should be composted with water and\r\nturning in heaps, but that would occasion expense beyond value probably,\r\nunless it could be composted with manure for market garden purposes. The\r\nhauling might be good work for idle teams. Spread the stuff rather\r\nthinly to be covered in with fall plowing, so that its decay could be\r\npromoted during the rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlow Stuff as a Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can we use sawdust and shavings from our high school shop so as to\r\ncombine it with street sweepings, lawn cuttings, etc., and insure ready\r\ndecay without objectionable features?\r\n\r\nDo not mix sawdust and shavings with lawn clippings and street\r\nsweepings, because of the great difference in susceptibility to decay.\r\nThe lawn clippings and street sweepings, which would contain\r\nconsiderable horse manure, would be readily transformed into a good\r\nfertilizer by composting. Such treatment, however, would have no\r\nappreciable effect upon sawdust or shavings for a considerable period of\r\ntime, and they would still be too coarse in their character to be of any\r\nvalue unless you have to deal with heavy clay soil, and in that case the\r\nsawdust and fine shavings might be dug in at once and trusted to decay\r\nslowly in the soil, at the same time improving its friability by their\r\ncoarser particles. If, however, you are dealing with light sandy loam,\r\nsuch coarse material would cause too rapid drying out and injure the\r\nplant, which might be benefited by lawn clippings and street sweepings.\r\nThe best way to get rid of the sawdust and shavings is to set up an\r\naltar, such as we have in our own backyard - a piece of an old boiler\r\nabout two feet in diameter and two and a half feet high, in which we\r\ncurrently burn all rubbish which is not available for quick composting\r\ninto a fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLime on Sandy Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think 500 pounds of lime per acre would help a sandy soil which\r\nhas not been enriched by pasturing or legumes? Of course, we would not\r\napply the lime until next fall before plowing.\r\n\r\nLime is not usually called for in a sandy soil, which probably requires\r\ndirect fertilizing with stable or commercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLime on Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat effect does putting lime on land have in holding moisture? Also,\r\nwill it pay to put it on a large field of alfalfa? The land is adobe. I\r\ncan get slaked lime for the hauling, distance being about five miles.\r\n\r\nThe lime will make the land more friable and, therefore, less disposed\r\nto bake and lose moisture by evaporation. Alfalfa is hungry for lime and\r\nis generally advanced by the application of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan new cow manure be put on alfalfa? Is not the best way to use the\r\nabove as a fertilizer in form of liquid being run from barn via pipes to\r\na settling-tank and from there via irrigation ditches to the land to be\r\nirrigated? What is the best way to get rid of cow manure so as to keep a\r\nbarn sanitary and the place free from stench?\r\n\r\nCow manure can be used to advantage on alfalfa. Corrals can be cleaned\r\nup and the manure spread at the beginning of the rainy season. During\r\nthe winter the manure can be spread as it is produced and very good\r\nresults will be noticed in the growth during the following summer. It is\r\nperfectly rational for you to use the liquid fertilizer as you propose\r\nin connection with irrigation water, but this is not generally done\r\nbecause of the cost of the outfit and the labor of handling the material\r\nin that way. The best way to keep a barn sanitary is to keep it clean,\r\nremoving all the waste matter to a considerable distance daily, allowing\r\nnothing to accumulate, and have the stable drainage arranged so that the\r\nstable can be frequently flushed out into good drainage outlets,\r\ncarrying the water to grass or alfalfa land if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are going to plant about 20 acres to corn on a sidehill and intend to\r\nput some fertilizer on, but want to give it to the corn only. Would it\r\nbe a good plan, after we have marked out our rows, to scatter some\r\nfertilizer in these marks and put the corn right on top of it?\r\n\r\nWe take it you ask about the use of a readily soluble commercial\r\nfertilizer. If so, you can do as you propose, being careful not to use\r\ntoo much. The operation of planting will distribute the fertilizer\r\nthrough enough soil if the application is not too heavy. The effect will\r\ndepend something upon what showers you get after planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScrap Iron as a Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs cast or other iron in small pieces plowed into the land of any\r\nbenefit to trees as a fertilizer? If so, what would be the value as such\r\nper 100 pounds? Junk dealers sometimes offer 25 cents per 100 pounds. If\r\nit has any value as a fertilizer, I am satisfied it must be worth four\r\ntimes that price. We pay three cents a pound for sulphate of iron as a\r\nfertilizer. Of course, it is a salt and dissolves quickly, therefore, I\r\nbelieve cast iron, even if it works slowly, has some value, and at the\r\nsame time farmers can clean up and get rid of a lot of rubbish.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the California soils are sufficiently supplied with iron\r\nby nature. Iron scraps have a little and remote value because they are\r\nso slowly available by the process of rust disintegration. It might,\r\ntherefore, be worth while for farmers to bury such scrap iron as\r\naccumulates on the place below the reach of the cultivating tools. But\r\nit would not be profitable to buy iron scraps at junk dealers' price,\r\nnor would it be profitable to haul this material any long distance, even\r\nif it could be had for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKelp as a Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there ill effects from using sea kelp as a fertilizer for orange\r\ntrees?\r\n\r\nThere is no ill effect. Sea kelp has been dragged from the beaches at\r\nlow tide, partly dried and used, for centuries perhaps, as field\r\nfertilizer for all sorts of crops in Europe, and for decades, to some\r\nextent, on the New England coast. The dangerous substance in it would\r\nseem to indicate that that is not present in sufficient quantity to\r\ncause trouble. The great difficulty lies in securing and transporting\r\nthe substance, for less than its fertilizing equivalent can be obtained\r\nby purchase of other more concentrated manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying Thomas Phosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the best time to apply Thomas phosphate slag on orchard land?\r\n\r\nAs Thomas phosphate is slowly soluble, it can be applied at any time\r\nduring the rainy season without danger of loss, and for the same fact,\r\nit should be applied early during the rainy season in order to be\r\navailable to trees during the following summer's growth. It ought,\r\nperhaps, to be added that other forms of phosphate have largely\r\ndisplaced slag during the last few years in the United States, other\r\nforms being more available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSugar Factory Lime for Fertilizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the lime from a sugar factory a good fertilizer for either oranges or\r\nwalnuts; if so, about what amount to the acre would you recommend?\r\n\r\nIf your land needs lime or if it is heavy and needs to be more friable,\r\nor if you have reason to think that it may be soured by exclusion of air\r\nor by excessive use of fermenting manures, the refuse lime you speak of\r\nwill do as a corrective just as other lime does, though, perhaps, not so\r\nactively. Beyond that there is nothing of great value in it. You can use\r\ntwo or three applications of 500 pounds to the acre without overdoing it\r\n- if your land needs it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNitrate With Stable Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to plant about 2000 plants of rhubarb. I intend to put some\r\ncow and horse manure under the plants as a fertilizer, but I do not\r\nthink I will have enough for all the plants, so I bought some nitrate of\r\nlime, with the intention of mixing the cow and horse manure with the\r\nlime nitrate, which I thought would allow me to spread the manure much\r\nthinner and I could cover more surface. Now I am not sure but the\r\nnitrate of lime will burn the manure if mixed with it.\r\n\r\nYou can mix either nitrate of lime or nitrate of soda with the stable\r\nmanure as you propose; in fact, it is frequently done. These nitrates\r\nare neutral salts and do not act on manure as caustic lime or wood ashes\r\nwould do. They are quite content to keep along without kicking their\r\nneighbors. But, of course, the more nitrate you add the more careful you\r\nmust be about using too much of the mixture, and as for putting manure\r\nunder any plant, at spring planting particular, it is dangerous\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNitrate of Soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I apply nitrate of soda as fertilizer for roses and other\r\nflowers and lawns during the summer months?\r\n\r\nOne has to be very careful in the use of nitrate of soda not to use too\r\nmuch and not to apply it unevenly, so that too much is brought in\r\ncontact with the roots of particular plants. From one to two hundred\r\npounds an acre evenly distributed is the usual prescription for nitrate\r\nof soda, although in the case of bearing orange trees considerably\r\nlarger amounts have been successfully used. This would be at the rate of\r\nabout one ounce to one square yard of surface. It would be a safe\r\napplication to begin with and could be increased a little on the basis\r\nof observation of results. Of course, the application should be\r\naccompanied by copious irrigation in order to dissolve and distribute\r\nthe substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing Strawberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have half an acre of strawberries which will fruit their second season\r\nthis spring, and half an acre set last month. I had intended to use\r\nnitrate of soda on them, but was talking to a friend who told me it\r\nwould kill my soil. That the first year it would produce an enormous\r\ncrop and the next year I couldn't raise anything. Which would be better\r\nto use here, stable manure or commercial fertilizer?\r\n\r\nIt is true that nitrate of soda is a stimulant of plants, and by\r\nrendering soil fertility immediately available may seem to reduce the\r\nsupply later, and yet it is a most available forcing fertilizer if used\r\nwith great caution, not over 200 pounds to the acre evenly scattered\r\nover the whole surface or a less amount, of course, if confined to\r\nparticular areas. If used in excess it may actually kill the plants.\r\nStill nitrate of soda is being used actively and intelligently by nearly\r\nall growers of plants and must be counted on the whole a valuable\r\nagency. If you can get stable manure, nothing is better as a complete\r\nplant food. Application to strawberries must be made at the close of the\r\nseason, rubbish scraped away and manure applied and allowed to stand on\r\nthe surface during the early rains, being worked into the soil during\r\nthe rainy season. If the soil is light, sandy loam, too much coarse\r\nmaterial must be avoided. Therefore, well-rotted manure is important on\r\nsuch soils while on a heavy soil coarser material may be used to\r\nadvantage if applied early in the rainy season. If you have no\r\nwell-rotted manure, a complete commercial fertilizer will give best\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate Applications of Nitrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some prune trees which blossomed some time ago and the prunes are\r\nalready set, and of small size. Would you recommend me to use an\r\napplication of, say 100 pounds per acre of nitrate of soda, applied\r\nimmediately, or is it a little too late in the season to get the desired\r\nresult?\r\n\r\nIt would be perfectly safe to use 100 pounds of nitrate of soda to the\r\nacre well distributed now; in fact, you could safely use twice as much,\r\nbut we doubt if you would get any benefit from it unless you should\r\nirrigate, for there is no reason to expect showers that would have\r\npenetrating powers enough to carry the nitrate any appreciable distance\r\ninto the soil. Of course, the nitrate could be plowed or cultivated in\r\nto a considerable depth, but that would probably result in losing\r\nmoisture by deep opening or turning, which would do more harm than any\r\ngain which the nitrate produces, if it were to become available. Our\r\njudgment would be, then, that it is too late for any benefit to accrue\r\nunless the land can be irrigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharcoal is a Medicine, Not a Food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently a lumberyard burned, leaving quite a quantity of charcoal. I\r\nhave a lot 50 x 150 feet in rhubarb. Would the charcoal be of any\r\nservice on that lot as a fertilizer? I now have it well fertilized with\r\nhorse manure, but would like to use the charcoal if it would be of any\r\nmaterial assistance to the plants.\r\n\r\nCharcoal is of no value as a fertilizer. It is practically\r\nindestructible in the soil. In fact, they are digging up now charcoal in\r\nthe graves of ancient Egyptians, who departed this life five thousand\r\nyears ago. Charcoal has corrective influence in absorbing some\r\nsubstances which might make the soil sour or otherwise inhospitable to\r\nplants. It has been found desirable sometimes to mix a certain amount of\r\ncharcoal with soil used in potting plants for the purpose of preventing\r\nsuch trouble. The only way to make your charcoal of any value as a\r\nfertilizer would be to set it on fire again and maintain the burning\r\nuntil it was reduced to ashes, which are a source of potash and,\r\ntherefore, desirable, but it will probably cost more than the product of\r\npotash will be worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHumus Burning Out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know whether or not dry-plowing land, in preparation for\r\nsowing oats for hay, injures the soil? I have heard that dry plowing\r\ntends to wear out the soil, as the soil is exposed to the sun a long\r\ntime before harrowing. I have been dry-plowing my land to kill the,\r\nweeds, but had a light crop of hay this year.\r\n\r\nThere is believed to be what is called \"a burning out of humus,\" by long\r\nexposure of the soil to the intense heat of our interior districts. It\r\nis probable that the reduction of humus is due more to the lack of\r\neffort to maintain the supply than to the actual destruction of it by\r\nculture methods. Such a little time as might intervene between dry\r\nplowing and sowing could not be charged with any appreciable destruction\r\nof soil fertility. It is altogether more probable that your hay crop was\r\nless from loss of moisture than from loss of other plant food; and it is\r\ndesirable to harrow a dry plowing, not so much to save the soil from the\r\naction of the atmosphere, as to conserve the moisture, which, as you\r\nknow, will rise from below and will rapidly be evaporated from the\r\nundisturbed bases of your furrows. Therefore, we should harrow a dry\r\nplowing as soon as practicable, but with particular reference to the\r\nmoisture supply rather than to other forms of fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStraw for Humus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you consider straw good to plow under for humus, and which kind,\r\nwheat, oat, or barley straw, is best?\r\n\r\nStraw, by its decay in the soil, produces humus and, therefore acts in\r\nthe same way just as does the decay of other forms of vegetation. As,\r\nhowever, straw is less easily decomposed than fresh vegetation, it is\r\nless valuable and may be troublesome by acquiring a greater amount of\r\nmoisture by interfering with cultivation or by tending to dry out the\r\nsoil to the injury of other plants. If the soil is heavy and moisture\r\nabundant, straw may be desirable, while in the case of a light soil and\r\nscant moisture, may be injurious. There is no particular difference in\r\nthe straw of the different grains from this point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Best Legume for Cover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you advise to sow as a crop to plow under? When should it be\r\nsowed, and when plowed under?\r\n\r\nThe best crop for green-manuring in any locality is the one which will\r\nmake the best growth when surplus moisture is available for it, and when\r\nits growth can be undertaken with least interference with irrigation,\r\ncultivation and other orchard operation. Generally in California, such a\r\ncrop can be most conveniently grown during the rainy season, but in some\r\nparts of the State where irrigation water is available, a summer growth\r\ncan be procured with very satisfactory results; so that we are now\r\ngrowing in California both wintergrowing legumes, like field peas,\r\nvetches, burr clover, etc., which are hardy enough to grow in spite of\r\nthe light frosts which may prevail, and are also growing summer legumes\r\nwhich thrive under high temperature, like cowpeas and other members of\r\nthe bean family, and for which water can be spared without injury to the\r\nfruit trees which share the application of the land with them. The\r\nplants which are worth trying are burr clover, common or Oregon vetch,\r\nCanadian field pea, and the common California or Niles pea. Whichever\r\none of these makes the best winter growth so that it can be plowed under\r\nearly in the spring, say in February or March, while there is still\r\nplenty of moisture in the soil for its decay, without robbing the trees\r\nor rendering the soil difficult of summer cultivation, is the plant for\r\nyou to use largely. All these plants should be sown in California\r\nvalleys and foothills, as soon as there is moisture enough from rainfall\r\nto warrant you in believing they will catch and continue to grow. If the\r\nland is light they can be put in with a cultivator and plowed under\r\ndeeply in the spring, as stated. If the land is heavy, probably a\r\nshallow plowing would be better to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCowpeas for Cover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI planted cowpeas between peach trees which I have kept irrigated; when\r\nshould they be plowed under?\r\n\r\nCowpeas will be killed by frost in most places and should, therefore, be\r\nplowed in this fall whenever you have a large growth of green stuff and\r\nthe ground gets moist enough so that the trees will not be endangered by\r\ndrying out of the soil, which is likely to occur after plowing in coarse\r\nmaterial, unless the soil is kept moist by rain or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGarden Peas for Green Manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to plant the Yorkshire Hero pea in on orange grove\r\nas late as December 25 and get a crop from the peas? Would this pea add\r\nmuch to the fertility of the soil?\r\n\r\nYou can sow any garden peas as late as December 25, if the ground is in\r\ngood condition and the temperature not too low. They are grown as a\r\nwinter crop except when the ground freezes. You would not get as much\r\ngood for the grove by growing these peas for the market as you would by\r\nplowing the whole growth under green, but you certainly will get\r\nadvantage from the decomposition of the pea straw and of the root growth\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrass for Green Manuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to sow this fall some green grass to be plowed in next spring to\r\nimprove the soil of part of my land. I read for that purpose a bulletin\r\nI had from the government, but the conditions are so different here in\r\nCalifornia that I am very much puzzled which kind to select.\r\n\r\nThere is no grass which grows quickly enough to be worth seeding in the\r\nfall for spring plowing. It is a good deal better to use a grain, either\r\nbarley or rye, for the seed is cheap, the growth quick and you can get a\r\ngood deal of green stuff to plow under. Legumes are, of course, better\r\nbecause of their ability to absorb atmospheric nitrogen, but any plant\r\nwhich makes a large green growth is good, and it is better to have a\r\nheavy weight of wild vegetation than to have a light growth of an\r\nintroduced legume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManure with a Clover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an old apple orchard in which I intend to sow burr clover. In\r\norder to get the clover to grow I know that I shall have to use\r\nfertilizer of some kind and this is what I want your advice about.\r\n\r\nIf you can get it, use stable manure at the time of sowing the clover\r\nseed. Stable manure alone will restore the humus and overcome the\r\nrebellious behavior of the soil. Possibly you cannot secure sufficient\r\nquantities of it. In that case a little with the burr clover seed will\r\ngive the plant a good start, or use a complete fertilizer to secure the\r\ngrowth of a legume in the freest and quickest way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFenugreek as a Cover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFenugreek has been recommended to be as a nitrogen-gathering plant, but\r\nI cannot find information as to the amount of nitrogen it gathers in its\r\nroots and tops, nor the amount of crop per acre.\r\n\r\nFenugreek is a good nitrogen gatherer and is desirable for green\r\nmanuring wherever you can get a good growth of the plant. You can count\r\nit worth as much as peas, vetches, etc., if you can get as much growth\r\nof the plant. It is most largely used in the lemon district near Santa\r\nPaula. The best way to proceed would be to try a small area of all the\r\nnitrogen gathering plants of which you can get the seed easily, and\r\ndetermine by your own observation which makes the best growth under your\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement of Cementing Soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like some advice in handling the \"cementy\" gravel soil. Manure\r\nis beneficial in loosening up the soil, but there is not enough\r\navailable. Would the Canadian field pea make a satisfactory growth here\r\nif sown as soon as the rains begin? I would try to grow either peas or\r\nvetch and plow under in February or March and then set trees or vines on\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe way to mellow your soil is certainly to use stable manure or to plow\r\nunder green stuff, as you propose. This increases the humus which the\r\nsoil needs and imparts all the desirable characters and qualities which\r\nhumus carries. You ought to get a good growth of Canadian field peas or\r\ncommon California field peas or the common Oregon vetch by sowing in the\r\nfall, as soon as the ground can be moistened by rain or irrigation, and,\r\nif the season is favorable, secure enough growth for plowing under in\r\nFebruary to make it worth while. Be careful, however, not to defer\r\nplanting trees and vines too late in order to let the green stuff grow,\r\nbecause this would hazard the success of your planting by the reduction\r\nof the moisture supply during the following summer by the amount which\r\nmight be required to keep the covered-in stuff decaying, plus loss of\r\nmoisture from the fact that the covered stuff prevented you from getting\r\nthorough surface cultivation during the dry season. For these reasons\r\none is to be careful about planting on covered-in stuff which has not\r\nhad a chance to decay. This consideration, of course, becomes negligible\r\nif you have water for summer irrigation, but if you expect to get the\r\ngrowth of your trees and vines with the rainfall of the previous winter,\r\nbe careful not to waste it in either of the ways which have been\r\nindicated, and above all, do not plant trees and vines too late.\r\nTheoretically, your position is perfect. The application of it, however,\r\nrequires some care and judgment. Rather than plant too late, you had\r\nbetter grow the green stuff the winter after the trees have been\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeeds Organic Matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have what I believe to be decomposed sandstone. Many rocks are still\r\nprojecting out of land which I blast and break up. The soil works freely\r\nwhen moist or wet, but when dry it takes a pick-axe to dig it up; a plow\r\nwon't touch it. Among my young fruit trees I tried to grow peas, beans,\r\ncarrots and beets, and although I freely irrigated them during the\r\nsummer and fall, and although I planted at different times, my peas and\r\nbeans have been a total failure, and the beets, carrots and onions\r\nnearly so. For years the land has grown nothing but weeds.\r\n\r\nYour soil needs organic matter which would make it more easy of\r\ncultivation, more retentive of moisture, and in every way better suited\r\nto the growth of plants. Liberal applications of stable manure would\r\nproduce best effects. No commercial fertilizer would begin to be so\r\ndesirable. If you can dig into the soil large amounts of weeds or other\r\nvegetable waste material, you would be proceeding along the same line,\r\nbut stable manure is better on account of its greater fertilizing\r\ncontent. You ought to be thankful that the soil has spunk enough to grow\r\nweeds. The Immanent Creator is still doing the best he can to help you\r\nout; take a hand yourself on the same line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Legumes in a Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have land on which I wish to plant to fruits, and I wish to build up\r\nthe soil all I can, by planting cover crops and plowing under. What\r\nwould be the best to plant this fall, to be plowed under next spring,\r\nand to plant again next spring to plow under in the fall? I will not be\r\nable to plant any trees before next fall or the following spring.\r\n\r\nGet in vetches as soon as the ground is in shape in the fall. Plow them\r\nunder early in the spring and close the covering and compact the green\r\nstuff by running a straight disk over the ground after plowing. This\r\nwill help decay and save moisture. Follow with cow peas as soon as you\r\nare out of the frost, disking in the seed so as not to disturb the stuff\r\npreviously covered in. Do not wait to put under the winter growth until\r\nit is safe to put on the cowpeas, for, if you do, you will lose so much\r\nmoisture that the cowpeas will not amount to much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Orchard Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe average about 35 inches of rainfall. With this heavy rainfall, is\r\nthere any advantage to be gained by early plowing and clean cultivation\r\nright through the winter? Would such plowing and cultivation result in\r\nany serious loss of plant food? Would you advise an early or late\r\napplication of nitrogen, such as nitrate or guano? If there is any loss\r\nfrom an early application, can it be determined by any means?\r\n\r\nThe old policy of clean winter cultivation has been largely abandoned.\r\nNearly everyone is trying to grow something green during the rainy\r\nseason to plow under toward the end of it. Even those who do not sow\r\nlegumes for this purpose are plowing under as good a weed cover as they\r\ncan get. This improves the soil both in plant food and in friability,\r\nwhich promotes summer pulverization and saves moisture from summer\r\nevaporation. Much less early plowing is done than formerly unless it be\r\nshallow to get in the seed for the cover crop; the deeper plowing being\r\ndone to put it under. Guano can be applied earlier in the winter than\r\nnitrate, which can be turned in with the cover crop, while the former\r\nmay be sown with the seed to promote the winter growth. Whether you are\r\nlosing your nitrate or not the chemist might determine for you by\r\nbefore-and-after analyses. If you are a good observer you may detect\r\nloss by absence of the effects you desire to secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoaking Seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think it a good practice to soak seeds before planting?\r\n\r\nIt is more desirable with some seeds than others and when the ground is\r\nrather dry or the sowing time rather late, than when sowing in moister\r\nground or earlier in the rainy season, when heavy rains are to be\r\nexpected. Soaking is simply a way to be sure that the seed covering has\r\nample moisture for softening and the kernel has what it requires for\r\nawakening it germ and meeting its needs. The soil may not always have\r\nenough to spare for these purposes and germination may be delayed or\r\nstarted and arrested. Ordinarily seeds can be helped by soaking a few\r\nhours in water at ordinary temperatures. Some very hard seeds like those\r\nof acacia trees, etc., are helped by hot water - even near the boiling\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Palms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy palms are quite small, but they do not seem to grow; they seem to be\r\ndrying up.\r\n\r\nThe growth of palms is proportional to the amount of soil moisture\r\navailable, providing it is not in excess and not too alkaline. Some\r\npalms are quite drouth-resisting, but it is a mistake to think of a palm\r\nas a desert plant and try to make a desert for it. A young palm,\r\nespecially, needs regular and ample water supply until it gets well\r\nestablished. Your plants may be drying up, or they may have had too much\r\nfrost or too much alkali. If they are not too far gone, they will come\r\nout later if you give them regular moisture and cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater from Wells or Streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our neighbors insists that water from a well is, in the long run,\r\nvery hard on the land, and that irrigation water is much to be\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nThere is no characteristic and permanent difference between waters from\r\nwells and waters from streams so far as irrigation is concerned. The\r\ncharacter depends upon the sources from which both are derived. Some\r\nwells may carry too much mineral matter in the form of salt, alkali,\r\netc., and some stream waters sometimes carry considerable alkali. For\r\nthis reason some wells may be better than streams and some streams\r\nbetter than wells. There is no general rule in the matter. Your neighbor\r\nmay be right as applied to your location, and may know from his\r\nexperience that the well water carries too much undesirable material.\r\nThat could only be determined by analysis, and the analysis must be made\r\nwhen the water is rather low, because during the rainy season, or soon\r\nafter it, the water may have less mineral impurity than later in the\r\nseason when it may be more concentrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShall He Irrigate or Cultivate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur soil is of an excellent quality, and I feel if the moisture were\r\nproperly conserved by suitable methods it could be made to produce\r\nfruits or some other very much more profitable than from hay and grain\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nWhether you can grow deciduous fruits successfully without irrigation\r\ndepends not only upon how well you conserve the moisture by cultivation,\r\nbut also whether the total rainfall conveys water enough, even if as\r\nmuch as possible of it is conserved. Again, you might find that thorough\r\ncultivation will give you satisfactory young trees, but would not\r\nconserve moisture enough for the same trees when they come into bearing.\r\nThis proposition should be studied locally. If you can find trees in the\r\nvicinity which do give satisfactory fruit under the rainfall, you would\r\nhave a practical demonstration which would be more trustworthy than any\r\nforecast which could be prepared upon theoretical grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondensation for Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a circular funnel of waterproofed building paper, or some better\r\ncheap device, were fastened about the base of the tree in such a manner\r\nas to catch and concentrate most of the drippings from the leaves, and\r\nthat water made to run down through a tube leading a suitable depth into\r\nthe earth, it seems to me that the number of foggy nights that occur in\r\nmany localities during the season might thus supply ample water for a\r\ntree's needs.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that water would not be secured in sufficient\r\nquantities to serve any notable irrigation purposes, or if the fogs were\r\nso thick as to yield water enough, the sunshine would be too scant for\r\nthe success of the plant. Put your idea to the test and see how much\r\nwater you could get from a tree of definite leaf area, which could be\r\nreadily estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast May I irrigated my prune trees for the first time, again during the\r\nfirst two weeks of last December. If no rain should come within the next\r\ntwo weeks, would you advise me to irrigate then? Should I plow before\r\nirrigating, or should irrigation be done before the buds swell?\r\n\r\nUnless your ground is deeply wet down by the rains which are now coming,\r\nirrigate it once, and do not plow before irrigating. The point is to get\r\nas much water into the ground and as much grass growth on top as you can\r\nbefore the spring plowing. Never mind about the swelling of the buds.\r\nThe trees will not be affected injuriously by getting a good supply of\r\nwinter water into the soil. There might be some danger with trees which\r\nbloom late in the spring, like citrus trees or olives, because by that\r\ntime the ground has become warm and the roots very active. At the\r\nblooming time of deciduous trees less danger would threaten, because\r\nthere is less difference between the temperature of the ground and the\r\nwater which you were then applying from a running stream. If you\r\nirrigated in furrows and, therefore, did not collect the water in mass,\r\nits temperature would rise by contact with air, which would be another\r\nreason for not apprehending trouble from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Water for Oranges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much water would you consider absolutely necessary to carry to\r\nfull-bearing citrus trees an clay loam-that is, how many acres to a\r\nminer's inch, figuring nine gallons per minute to the inch?\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, depend upon the age of the trees, as old bearing\r\ntrees may require twice as much as young trees. We would estimate for\r\nbearing trees, on such retentive soil, 30-acre inches per year applied\r\nin the way best for the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDamping-off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy orange seed-bed stack has \"damp-off.\" Same say \"too much water;\" \"not\r\nenough water;\" \"put on lime;\" etc. I use a medium amount of water and\r\nmore of my stack is affected than that of any other grower. One man has\r\nkept his well soaked since planting, and only about six plants were\r\naffected. Another has used but little water, keeping them very dry; he\r\nhas lost none.\r\n\r\nDamping-off is due to a fungus which attacks the tender growth when\r\nthere is too much surface moisture. It may be produced by rather a small\r\namount of water, providing the soil is heavy and the water is not\r\nrapidly absorbed and distributed. On the other hand, a lighter soil\r\ntaking water more easily may grow plants without damping-off, even\r\nthough a great deal more water has been used than on the heavier soil.\r\nToo much shade, which prevents the sun from drying the surface soil, is\r\nalso likely to produce damping-off, therefore, one has to provide just\r\nthe right amount of shade and the right amount of ventilation through\r\ncirculation of the air, etc. The use of sand on the surface of a heavier\r\nsoil may save plants from damping-off, because the sand passes the water\r\nquickly and dries, while a heavier surface soil would remain soggy. Lime\r\nmay be of advantage if not used in too great quantities because it\r\ndisintegrates the surface of the soil and helps to produce a dryness\r\nwhich is desirable. Keeping the surface dry enough and yet providing the\r\nseedlings with moisture for a free and satisfactory growth is a matter\r\nwhich must be determined by experience and good judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigated or Non-Irrigated Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any difference between the same kind of fruit trees grown\r\nwithout irrigation and with it?\r\n\r\nIt does not make a particle of difference, if the trees are grown well\r\nand matured well. Overirrigated trees or trees growing on land naturally\r\nmoist may be equally bad. Excessively large trees and stunted trees are\r\nboth bad; with irrigation you may be more likely to get the first kind;\r\nwithout it you are more likely to get the latter. There is, however, a\r\ndifference between a stunted tree and a wellgrown small tree, and as a\r\nrule medium-sized trees are most desirable than overgrown trees. The\r\nmere fact of irrigation does not make either good trees or bad trees: it\r\nis the man at the ditch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToo Little Rather Than Too Much Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking through an orchard of 18-year-old prune trees on riverbottom\r\nland, I found a number of the trees had died. A well bored in the\r\norchard strikes water at about 15 feet. I find no apparent reason far\r\nthe death of these trees unless it is that the tap roots reach this body\r\nof water and are injuriously affected thereby.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that water at 15 feet depth could possibly kill a\r\nprune tree. It is more likely that owing to spotted condition of the\r\nsoil, gravel should occur in different places, and with gravel three or\r\nfour feet below the surface a tree might actually die although there was\r\nplenty of water at a depth of 15 feet. There is more danger that the\r\ntrees died from lack of water than from an oversupply of it, and it is\r\nquite likely also that you could pump and irrigate to advantage large\r\ntrees which did not seem to be up to the standard of the whole place, as\r\nmanifested by lack of bearing, smallness of leaves, which would be apt\r\nto turn yellow too early in the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly Too Much Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy trees are four years old and are as follows: Peach, fig, loquat,\r\napple, apricot and plum. Last year they had plenty of blossoms, but I\r\ngot no fruit. I always watered them twice a week in summer.\r\n\r\nYou are watering your trees too much; stimulating their growth too much,\r\nand this, while a tree is young, is apt to postpone its fruit bearing.\r\nGive the soil a good soaking about once a mouth, unless you are situated\r\nin a sandy or gravelly soil, in which more frequent applications may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToo Little Water After Dynamiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn planting almonds on a dry hard soil I dynamited the holes and ran\r\nabout 200 gallons of water into each hole before planting. About 95 per\r\ncent of the trees started growth, but seem now to be in a somewhat\r\ndormant state, the leaves of some being slightly wilted. All the trees\r\nwere watered since planting. I have been told I made a mistake by\r\nthrowing water in the dynamited holes. When the holes were watered the\r\nground was very dry and the water disappeared in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nYou have used too little water rather than too much. Dry soil of fine\r\ntexture can suck up an awful lot of moisture, which can be drawn off so\r\nfar, or so widely distributed, that there will not be enough for the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the roots. The dynamiting tended to deep drying\r\nand necessitated much more irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Young Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have just put out 50 acres to walnuts. The party who put them out\r\nwants me to have some boxes or troughs made 15 inches long with a 3-inch\r\nopening, and put in on the slant so as to have the water hit the roots.\r\n\r\nMany such arrangements of boxes, perforated cans, pieces of tile, etc.,\r\nhave been proposed during the last fifty years in California for\r\naccomplishing the purposes which are mentioned in your letter, and all\r\nsuch devices have been abandoned as undesirable. They may bring the\r\nwater to bear upon a lower level as intended, but the free access of air\r\nand the fact that, with their use, proper stirring of the soil is\r\nneglected renders them undesirable. The best way to water young trees\r\nsingly is to make a trench around tree, but not allowing the water to\r\ntouch the bark, applying the water and then thoroughly hoe when the\r\nsurface soil comes into proper condition. Young trees treated in this\r\nway, with the surface always in good condition, do not require much\r\nwater. The amount depends, of course, upon whether the soil is naturally\r\nporous or retentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderground Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow extensively used and with what results is the underground tile\r\nsystem for irrigation used, and what especial character of soil is it\r\nbest suited for?\r\n\r\nNot extensively at all; in fact, if there is an acre of it which has\r\nbeen for three years in continuous and successful operation, it has\r\nescaped us. After forty years of trial of different systems, none has\r\ndemonstrated value enough to warrant its use. Theoretically, they are\r\nexcellent; in practice they are defective. Surface application in\r\ndifferent ways, according to the nature of the soil, accompanied with\r\nthorough cultivation, is the only thing that at the present time\r\npromises satisfactory results, except that where the land suits it,\r\nirrigation by underflow from ditches on higher elevations is being\r\nsuccessfully used on small areas in the foothills. For gardens the most\r\npromising arrangement seems to be a laying of drain tiles rather near\r\nthe surface, which shall be taken up each year, cleaned of silt and\r\nplant roots, and relaid along the rows before planting; but this calls\r\nfor too much labor, except perhaps for amateur gardeners. The kind of\r\nsoil best suited to such a system is a medium loam which will distribute\r\nwater sufficiently to avoid saturation and air-exclusion. Both a heavy\r\nsoil which does this, and a coarse sandy loam which takes water down out\r\nof reach of shallow-rooting plants too rapidly and lacks capillarity to\r\ndraw it up again, are ill adapted to underground distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigation of Potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you kindly tell me when is the proper time to irrigate potatoes,\r\nbefore they bloom or after they bloom, and do they require much water?\r\n\r\nIt should seldom be necessary to irrigate potatoes after the bloom\r\nappears. Potatoes do not need much water, and there is danger of giving\r\nthem too much. It is absolutely essential to see that there is no check\r\nin the growth of the plant, for once the growth is at all checked by\r\ndrought, and irrigation is done, a new lot of potatoes start and new and\r\nold growth of tubers are worthless. Give what irrigation is needed and\r\nmake cultivation do the rest. The secret of success is keeping the soil\r\ncontinually at the right moisture, so that the first growth of the plant\r\nmay continue regularly until the tubers are brought to maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigated or Non-Irrigated Apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere soil and climatic conditions are favorable to the raising of\r\napples, what effect has irrigation an them?\r\n\r\nThe commercial product of California apples is chiefly made upon deep\r\nsoils in districts of ample rainfall so that the fruit can be perfected\r\nand the trees maintained in thrift by thorough cultivation and without\r\nirrigation. In the foothill and mountain regions, however, apple trees\r\nare irrigated and first-class fruit produced by the process. There is no\r\nparticular virtue in the absence of irrigation nor in the presence of\r\nit. All that the tree requires is that the moisture supply should be\r\nadequate and timely. There are undoubtedly many apple orchards grown\r\nwithout irrigation where a little water during the latter part of the\r\nsummer would be a great advantage for the perfection of winter\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Walnuts-Checks or Furrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best method to irrigate a tract of 25 acres of sandy\r\nsediment sail, nearly level, preparatory to planting walnuts?\r\n\r\nBy all means use the furrow system of irrigation unless your land should\r\nbe so light that the water would sink in the furrows and distribution\r\nwould be very unequal without covering the whole surface as is done by\r\nfilling checks. When the land cannot be covered well by the furrow\r\nsystem, checking is resorted to, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer and Fall Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it desirable to irrigate peach trees in the fall after the crop is\r\ngathered?\r\n\r\nThe popularity of autumn irrigation for peaches in the San Joaquin\r\nvalley is based upon the experience of the last few years where trees\r\nthat have been allowed to become dormant too early in the season and\r\nhave been weakened by a long period of soil-drought during the autumn,\r\nhave cast their blossoms or manifested other indications of weakness\r\nduring the following year. It is thoroughly rational to apply irrigation\r\nto hold the leaves and secure their service in the strengthening of\r\nbloom buds for the following year by irrigation. Such irrigation should\r\nbe applied immediately after the fruit is gathered or even before that,\r\nif the yellowing of the leaves indicates lack of strength in the tree\r\nand the frequency and amount of irrigation during the autumn depends\r\nupon whether the soil will hold moisture enough to carry the tree to its\r\nproper period of dormancy. This may be determined by the aspect of the\r\ntrees and by digging down two or three feet to see whether the soil\r\ncarries moisture which is likely to be sufficient until the coming of\r\nthe rains. Whether late irrigation will be necessary is also\r\ndeterminable by the character of the soil; on close retentive soil it\r\nmay not be necessary, while on loose, sandy or gravelly soil it may be\r\nessential to the life of the tree. One has to settle all these matters\r\nby judgment and not by recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizers in Irrigation Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you recommend putting fertilizers in irrigating water? I am about to\r\nwater the orchard and am thinking of putting some nitrate in the water.\r\n\r\nYou can distribute any soluble fertilizer by dissolving it in irrigation\r\nwater, but few have ever done it because of the difficulties of getting\r\nequal strength in running water. It is much easier to distribute on land\r\nbefore irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigating Alfalfa on Heavy Soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does alfalfa succeed on adobe and soils slightly modified from it?\r\nDoes irrigation work well an adobe planted to alfalfa?\r\n\r\nIf you get the irrigation adjusted so that the soil shall not be\r\nwater-logged and so that the water does not stand on the surface when\r\nthe sun is hot, you can get plenty of good alfalfa on a heavy soil.\r\nIrrigation on adobe soils must be done more frequently and a less amount\r\nat each application to guard against the dangers named above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Water for Crops?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame of my land is heavy but the most of it is light soil. I want\r\nalfalfa mostly, same potatoes and grain, and later oranges, olives and\r\nother fruit. How much water in inches or acre feet is required per acre\r\nper year far the irrigation of it?\r\n\r\nThe amount of water required to grow different crops depends upon the\r\ncrop itself, upon the time of the year in which it grows, the character\r\nof the soil, etc. There is no such thing as stating how much water would\r\nbe used for all crops on all soils, and at all times of the year. The\r\nrange would be from, say, ten acre inches for irrigation of deciduous\r\nfruits, which need moisture supplementary to rainfall; twice or thrice\r\nas much for citrus fruit trees; four or five times as much for alfalfa\r\nwhere a full number of cuttings are required. These are, of course, only\r\nrough estimates which would have to be modified according to local\r\nrainfall and soil character. Water should be applied frequently enough\r\nto keep the lower soil amply moist. A color of moisture is not enough\r\nand a muddy condition results from too much water. One has to learn to\r\njudge when there is moisture enough, and a good test of this to take up\r\na handful of soil, squeeze it and open the hand. If the ball retains its\r\nshape it is probably moist enough. If it has a tendency to crack upon\r\nopening the hand, it is too dry. This test, of course, is somewhat\r\naffected by the character of the soil, but one has to form the best\r\njudgment possible how far allowance has to be made for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSewage Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the usefulness or harmfulness of the outflow from septic tanks\r\nfor use an fruits and vegetables?\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to the suitability of the affluent from a septic\r\ntank for irrigation purposes. Waste waters are sometimes injurious when\r\nthey are loaded with antiseptics, but the septic tank will not work\r\nunless it has a chance for free fermentation in the absence of\r\nantiseptics, therefore, this objection against waste water does not hold\r\nwith the out-flow from septic tanks. It has the advantage over straight\r\nsewage irrigation because fermentation in the septic tank is believed to\r\nfree the water from many dangerous germs, though not all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreamery Wastes for Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the waste water from a creamery, pumped into a ditch and used for\r\nirrigating sandy loam orchard land, or nursery stack, in any way be\r\ninjurious to the land or the trees?\r\n\r\nIt will depend upon the amounts of salt and alkaline washing materials\r\nwhich it carries. This would be governed, of course, by the amount of\r\nfresh water used for dilution in the irrigation ditch. There are two\r\nways to determine the question. One would be to make an analysis of a\r\nsample of the water taken when it contains the largest amount of these\r\nmaterials after the dilution with ditch water. Another way would be to\r\nplant some corn, squashes, barley and other plants, so that they would\r\nbe freely irrigated by the water during one growing season. This would\r\nbe rather better than an analysis, because everybody could see whether\r\nthe plants grew well or not, and would be apt to be better convinced by\r\nwhat they see than by an opinion which a chemist might give on the basis\r\nof an analysis. The use of this water on a sandy loam would obviously be\r\nless injurious than upon a heavy retentive soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse Waste Water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it feasible to use wash water, etc., for watering fruit trees and\r\nvegetables?\r\n\r\nKitchen sink water is not desirable because of its great content of\r\ngrease, but wash-tub and bathtub water are good. Strong soapsuds should\r\nbe mixed with considerable rinsing water to escape excessive content of\r\nalkali. Run the water in hoe-ditches, along the rows of vegetables,\r\nhoeing thoroughly as soon as the land hoes well, changing the runs of\r\nwater so that the soil does not become compacted but is kept friable and\r\nlively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDraining a Wet Spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a spot of about an acre that in a wet winter becomes very miry\r\nand as a rule is wet up to July. Can I put in a ditch two and one-half\r\nfeet deep and fill in with small stones for a foot or a foot and a half,\r\nuntil I can afford to buy tiles?\r\n\r\nDrains made of small stones are often quickly filled with soil and stop\r\nrunning. However, it will work for a time, and such drains were formerly\r\nlargely employed in Eastern situations when cash was scant and stones\r\nabundant. Dig the ditch bottom to a depth of not less than 3 or 3 1/2\r\nfeet, then put in the stones deep enough not to be interfered with by\r\nplowing. If you have flat stones you can make quite a water-way with\r\nthem and fill in with small stones above it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart V. Live Stock and Dairy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Milk House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a legal milk house in California?\r\n\r\nThe State dairy law says little concerning the construction or equipment\r\nof the milk house. It says that the house, or room, shall be properly\r\nscreened to exclude flies and insects, and is to be used for the purpose\r\nof cooling, mixing, canning and keeping the milk. The milk room shall\r\nnot be used for any other purpose than milk handling and storing, and\r\nmust be 100 feet or more distant from hogpen, horse stable, cesspool or\r\nsimilar accumulation of filth, and must be over 50 feet from cow stalls\r\nor places where milking is done. In regard to the size of the milk room\r\nand equipment, nothing is said provided it is large enough for the milk\r\nto be handled conveniently. Concrete milk houses, however, had best have\r\nsmooth-finished floors and walls. The interior of the milk house is also\r\nto be whitewashed once in two years or oftener. If milk from the dairy\r\nis to go to a city, the requirements will be more severe than provided\r\nin the State law, and must conform to the ordinances of the city to\r\nwhich the milk is to be sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCure for a Self-Milker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do for a young cow that milks herself?\r\n\r\nFit a harness consisting of two light side slats and a girth and neck\r\nstrap in such a way that the cow cannot reach her udder. Unless she is\r\nparticularly valuable for milk, it will save you a lot of worry to fix\r\nher up for beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong Milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I overcome strong milk in a three-quarter Jersey cow? I had been\r\nfeeding alfalfa hay with two quarts alfalfa meal and one quart middlings\r\ntwice a day. Thinking the strong milk came from the feed I changed to\r\noat hay and alfalfa with a soft feed of bran and middlings.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in either ration that could cause strong milk, nor will\r\na change of feed likely benefit the trouble. If the cow is in good\r\nphysical condition the trouble probably comes from the entrance of\r\nbacteria during or after milking. Thoroughly clean up around the milking\r\nstable, followed by a disinfection of the premises. Have the flanks,\r\nudder and teats of the cow thoroughly cleaned before milking and scald\r\nall utensils used for the milk. Harmful bacteria may have gotten well\r\nestablished on the premises and the entrance of a few is enough to\r\nseriously affect the flavor of the milk. Once the trouble is checked it\r\ncan be kept down with the usual sanitary methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparator as Milk Purifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a neighbor who contends that a cream separator purifies the milk\r\nthat passes through it. I say that it does not purify the milk. I agree\r\nthat it does take out some of the heavy particles of dirt and filth, but\r\nthat it cannot take out what is already in solution with the milk.\r\n\r\nThe purification naturally cannot be very great, and if milk is produced\r\nin unsanitary fashion, running through the separator will do little, if\r\nany, good. Nevertheless, the separator does remove more than just the\r\nsolid particles of dirt. The purifying comes by leaving behind the\r\nseparator slime, so called, the slimy material left behind after a good\r\ndeal of milk has been run through. In fact, some creameries separate\r\nmilk, only to mix milk and cream again, largely for the purpose of\r\nremoving the impurities found in the slime. In this slime are not only\r\nthe impurities that fall into the milk, but also some of the fibrous\r\nmatter that is part of the milk, and this gathers, being pulled out by\r\ngravity as are the fat particles, it seems to gather with it a few more\r\nbacteria than remain in the milk itself. Material in real solution, as\r\nsugar is in solution in water, naturally is practically unaffected by\r\nseparation. You are, therefore, right to the extent that you cannot\r\nproduce unsanitary milk and clean it with the separator, but your\r\nneighbor is right to the extent that the separator does remove some\r\nimpurities and is used just for that purpose. There is also in the dairy\r\ntrade a centrifugal milk clarifier which is constructed in somewhat\r\nsimilar manner to a cream separator, but acts differently on the milk in\r\nnot interfering with cream rising by gravity when separated cream and\r\nmilk are mixed after cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nButter Going White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI bought some butter and during the warm weather it melted. About 40 or\r\n50 per cent was white, while the balance was yellow and went to the top.\r\nWhen the butter remelted, the yellow portion melted, leaving the white\r\nportion retaining its shape. The white portion did not taste like\r\nordinary butter. The butter made from our cows' cream melted at a higher\r\ntemperature, but did not have a white portion. Why did our butter not\r\nact like the creamery butter?\r\n\r\nSamples of butter have occasionally been sent to this office that have\r\nturned white on the outside, and since the white part has a very\r\ndisagreeable, tallowy flavor, people think that tallow or oleomargarine\r\nhas been mixed with it, but we have never been able to find any foreign\r\nsubstance in any of the samples. We have found that some of the best\r\nbrands of butter will turn white first on the outside and the white\r\ncolor will gradually go deeper if the butter is exposed to a current of\r\nair or if left in the sun a short time - F. W. Andreason, State Dairy\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is \"Butter-fat?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know what \"butter-fat\" means. I have asked farmers this\r\nquestion and no one seems to know. I suppose all parties dealing with\r\ncreameries understand what the standard of measure or weight of\r\nbutter-fat is, but it is my guess that there are thousands of farmers\r\nwhom, if they were asked this question, would not know. We, of course,\r\nknow that butter is sold by the pound and cream by the pint, quart or\r\ngallon, but what is butter-fat sold by?\r\n\r\nButter-fat is the yellow substance which forms the larger part of\r\nbutter. Besides, this fat butter is composed of 16 per cent or less of\r\nwater and small amounts of salt, and other substances of which milk is\r\ncomposed. From 80 to 85 per cent or so of ordinary butter is the fat\r\nitself. It is sold by weight. The cream from which butter is made is\r\ntaken to the creamery and weighed, not measured. A small sample is\r\ntested by the so-called Babcock test to determine the exact percentage\r\nof fat, and payment mode on this basis. For instance, if 1,00 pounds of\r\ncream is one-third butter-fat, the dairyman receives pay for 33 1/3\r\npounds of this substance. If it is only one-quarter fat, he receives pay\r\nfor 25 pounds. Ordinary cream varies within these limits, but may be\r\nmuch richer or thinner. Cream after the butterfat is removed is much\r\nlike skimmed milk, although it has less water in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Would Not Butter Come?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the trouble with cream that you churn on from Monday until\r\nSaturday, then have to give up in despair and turn it out to the hogs?\r\nWe warmed it, and we cooled it, and used a dairy thermometer, but\r\nnothing would do.\r\n\r\nIf the cream was in churnable condition otherwise, the probability is\r\nthat it was too cool when you started churning. It should be about 62°\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrying a Persistent Milker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cow is to come fresh about the middle of next mouth, and in the last\r\ntwo weeks her milk has changed in some way so that the cream makes very\r\nyellow butter and comes to butter nearly as quick as when the cow was\r\nfresh. Would it best for her to go entirely dry before coming fresh, or\r\nwill it be all right if she does not entirely dry up?\r\n\r\nIf your cow has been able to pick up any special amount of grass since\r\nthe rains came it might add to the color of the butter. A cow's milk\r\nalso gets richer toward the end of her lactation period, which may make\r\na richer cream and make the butter come quickly There does not seem to\r\nbe anything to worry about. The cow would probably do better if she\r\ncould become entirely dry before calving, but unless you can easily dry\r\nher up it would be dangerous to try to force her to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nButter-fat in Sweet and Sour Cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creamery wagon takes our cream every other day. Without ice it is\r\nalmost impossible to keep the cream sweet during the hot weather. By the\r\ntime the wagon gets here, several hours after the fourth milking, the\r\ncream is quite sour. Does sour cream test lower than sweet cream! Is any\r\nbutter-fat lost due to evaporation in dry weather?\r\n\r\nThe test of sour cream will be as accurate as of sweet cream, if\r\nproperly made, but it is rather more difficult to make; or rather, to\r\nget the material into condition to work well. There is no fat lost by\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCream That Won't Whip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I sell my cream from the separator they say they cannot whip it.\r\nCan you tell me if there is any way that I can make the cream whip?\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no good reason for blaming the separator for your\r\ndifficulty with the cream. Possibly the cream may be too thin, as thin\r\ncream is sometimes difficult to whip. There is also the possibility that\r\nthe fat globules in the cream may be rather small, but that will be the\r\nfault of the cows, not of the separator. Another reason why the cream\r\nmay not whip well may be that it is used too quickly. If the milk is all\r\nright, the cream not too thin and it is permitted to stand for 12 hours\r\nor so there should be no trouble with it. Occasionally when cream is\r\npasteurized it will not whip well. In these cases, or any other that may\r\ndevelop, the application of lime water to the cream at the rate of 1\r\ngallon to 60 will remove the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Certified Milk?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat process has milk to go through to be called \"certified,\" and what\r\ndemand is there for it?\r\n\r\nCertified milk is simply milk that is produced and marketed under\r\nprescribed sanitary conditions. The dairies are inspected periodically\r\nby representatives of some medical society or other organization to see\r\nthat all regulations are observed, who certify that this is done; hence\r\nthe name. Milk from other dairies is prohibited by law from being sold\r\nunder the name \"certified milk.\" Among the requirements in its\r\nproduction are that the cows must be free from tuberculosis and\r\notherwise perfectly healthy, the stable to have a concrete floor which\r\nis washed out after each milking, the milkers to have special clothes\r\nfor milking, etc. The milk is cooled and bottled immediately after\r\nmilking, and kept at a low temperature until it reaches the consumer, to\r\nprevent the entrance of dirt of any kind or the development of the few\r\nbacteria that must gain entrance before it is bottled. To produce such\r\nmilk requires much expensive apparatus and much more labor than to\r\nproduce ordinary milk, and as a result it sells for a much higher price,\r\nboth to distributor and consumer, so that the market for it is rather\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJersey Shorthorn Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I cross Registered Shorthorns with a Jersey bull, what dairying value\r\nwill the progeny have?\r\n\r\nThis makes an excellent cross. Even beef-strain Shorthorns have lots of\r\nmilking power if it is developed and the Jersey cross will bring it out\r\nin the progeny. The cows have excellent milking qualities and give very\r\nrich milk. They also have a big frame and fine constitution. About the\r\nfinest cows in Humboldt county were of this cross although Jersey bulls\r\nhave been used so long that the Shorthorn blood is almost eliminated.\r\nThe first \"improved\" cattle in California and the first cross made for\r\ndairy purposes was Jersey bulls upon grade Shorthorn cows. Later the\r\nHolstein Friesians became popular and they and their grades are now most\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Free Martin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a Jersey cow who has just had twin calves, a heifer and a bull.\r\nThe heifer was born about five minutes before the bull and seems to be\r\nthe stronger. My neighbors tell me to fatten both for the butcher, for\r\nthey say the heifer will be barren. The mother is a young cow, as this\r\nis her second calf. Kindly inform if this is one of nature's laws or if\r\nthere is a possibility of the heifer turning out all right?\r\n\r\nThe probability is that it will be better to veal the heifer than to\r\nraise her, as most heifer calves twinned with a bull are free martins,\r\nor animals of mixed sex and no good for breeding purposes or for\r\nprofitable milk production. If the bull is a good animal, he probably\r\nwill be all right, as this twinning does not seem to affect a bull calf,\r\nthough it does the heifer. It does not always happen that the heifer is\r\nworthless for breeding, but the probability is so great that you had\r\nbetter have her killed and be done with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a \"Grade\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the term \"grade\" mean an animal whose sire is a thoroughbred and\r\nwhose dam is a scrub, or just one who is selected from others because of\r\nher good points or those of her mother?\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, a grade animal is one having more or less pure-bred\r\nblood, but not enough, or otherwise too irregular, for registry under\r\nthe rules of the association of the breed to which it has affiliation.\r\nIt does not refer to selection without use of a pure-blood sire at some\r\npoint in the ancestry, but this is not a distinction of much moment, for\r\nit is hard to find animals which have not borrowed something from some\r\ncross with pure blood, though remote. The terms high and low grade are\r\nsometimes used to signify amount of pure blood recognizable by form and\r\nother characters or remembered by owners or their neighbors. Generally\r\nspeaking, a grade is anything not entitled to registry, though\r\nordinarily it refers to the offspring of a pure-bred sire and a cow of\r\nanother or of no breed. The offspring of a pure-bred cow and a scrub\r\nbull would also be a grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding a Young Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a beautiful colt 22 months old that will weigh 1200 or 1300\r\npounds; very compactly built, and has extra health, life and vigor. I\r\nwant this colt for a broodmare. Would you advise breeding at two or\r\nthree years old?\r\n\r\nAuthorities agree at placing the age from two to three years, according\r\nto the development of the animal and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To Breed in the Purple.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by breeding a sow in the purple? I have seen this\r\nstatement used many times by breeders who advertised \"sows safe in pig\r\nbred in the purple.\"\r\n\r\nTo be \"bred in the purple\" means to be of royal or princely parentage.\r\nIt originally was used in reference to the nobility of Europe, as purple\r\nwas the insignia of royal blood, due to the fact that purple was the\r\nrarest and most costly color and only the rich and noble could buy it.\r\nWhen used in referring to live stock, it signifies that the animal in\r\nquestion has a long line of blooded ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCows for Hill Country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat breed of dairy cows do you think would be preferable to keep for\r\nbutter, at an altitude of about 1800 feet, in Nevada county - Jerseys,\r\nGuernseys or Ayrshires? I do not mean to have them to rustle for their\r\nown living, but to feed them well, house and care for them in all\r\nweather, particularly in stormy weather.\r\n\r\nThe best breed for a man is the one he likes best, providing it has been\r\nbred for the purposes he desires to attain. All the breeds you mention\r\nare suited to the scheme you outline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoothill Dairying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any risk to run in taking cows to an altitude of 2000 from a\r\nmuch lower one?\r\n\r\nThere is no quarrel between a cow and a mountain. Ever since the\r\nsettlement of the State cows have been driven directly from the valley\r\nup to the mountain meadow pastures, both for butter and for beef-making,\r\nin the summer time. The foothill elevation you mention is only a\r\nstarting to elevations of 6000 feet and more to which cattle are driven\r\nevery season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBad-Tempered Jerseys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJersey bulls are apt to become vicious after a time; is it so to the\r\nsame extent with bulls of the other named breeds?\r\n\r\nThe Jersey bull is conceded to be crosser and more dangerous than other\r\nbulls, but no bull should ever be allowed to have a chance at a man.\r\nNever consider a bull gentle and you will be safe with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding in Line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it right and proper to breed a pedigreed registered bull to his\r\ndaughter, who is the offspring of a grade cow? If it is not right,\r\nexplain why. If it can be done, will the offspring be physically perfect\r\nand an improvement, or will it have poorer qualities than its sire and\r\nmother? If this inbreeding can be done successfully, how long can it be\r\ncarried on, or, in other words, how long could one bull be bred back\r\ninto his own offspring? Can a herd be perfected in this way?\r\n\r\nIt is right and proper to breed a registered sire to his daughter, who\r\nis the offspring of a grade cow. The first cross is all right and the\r\noffspring ought to be physically perfect. This is a first step in what\r\nwe call line breeding, but in line breeding proper, both animals must be\r\npure bloods and registered, having ancestors on both sides which have a\r\nlong line of good individuals with strong constitutions and true to\r\ntype. To do this, one must have a perfect ideal in mind. This line\r\nbreeding is what has developed the breeds today up to the high standard\r\nof perfection. Breeding sire to daughter, if followed along these lines,\r\nwill be all right; at least, it was so in the case of Amos Cruickshank,\r\nthe great shorthorn breeder. You cannot successfully breed back on the\r\ndaughter's offspring, but if you use a straight out-cross on the\r\ndaughter's offspring you can again use this sire on her produce with\r\nmarked success. In the case of a grade cow and registered sire, there\r\nare two things which will make you either lose or win with one cross,\r\nand that is regarding the breeding of your sire. If he is just an\r\nordinary-bred fellow it will be a hit-and-miss game, but if he is from a\r\nlong line of good ancestors on his dam's side, you can very materially\r\nimprove the, herd, because always keep in mind the female produce from\r\nthe sire's dam will grow with age toward the sire's dam. So if your\r\nfirst cross from your first sire is all right, use a straight out-cross\r\nbull, but be sure he is what he ought to be, and then you can use your\r\nold bull back on his heifers. Of course, a man practicing this breeding\r\nought to be a thorough stockman and a first-class judge of live stock. -\r\nW. M. Carruthers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitewashes for Stock Buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI desire whitewash recipes which have given durable results on\r\noutbuildings.\r\n\r\nIt is so desirable to make outbuildings neat and clean, and so important\r\nto keep trees from sunburning, etc., that a durable whitewash as cheaply\r\nand easily made as possible is very important. The following are\r\ncommended: No. 1 - To half a bucketful of unslaked lime add 2 handfuls\r\nof common salt, and soft soap at the rate of 1 pound to 15 gallons of\r\nthe wash. Slake slowly, stirring all the time. This quantity makes 2\r\nbucketfuls of very adhesive wash, which is not affected by rain. No. 2 -\r\nWhitewash requires some kind of grease in it to make it most durable.\r\nAny kind of grease, even though it be old and partly spoiled, will\r\nanswer all right, though tallow is best. The grease imparts to the\r\nwhitewash an oil property the same as in good paint. Tallow will stay\r\nright on the job for years, and the cheapest of it will do. In order to\r\nprepare this grease and get it properly incorporated into the white\r\nwash, it is necessary to put the grease in a vessel on the stove, and\r\nboil it into a part of the whitewash so as to emulsify it and get it\r\ninto such condition that it can be properly incorporated with the\r\nwhitewash mixture. No. 3 - For every barrel of fresh lime, add 16 pounds\r\nof tallow, 16 pounds of salt and 4 pounds of glue, dissolved. Mix all\r\ntogether and slack; keep covered, and let stand a few days before using.\r\nAdd water to bring the right consistency to spread readily. For nice\r\ninside work strain it. When less than a barrel of lime is used, the\r\nquality of the wash does not seem so good. It is better to apply hot,\r\nbut it does well cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Whitewash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the government recipe for whitewash?\r\n\r\n\"Take a half bushel of well-burned, unslaked lime, slake it with boiling\r\nwater, cover during the process to keep in steam, strain the liquid\r\nthrough a fine sieve or strainer, and add to it 7 pounds of salt,\r\npreviously dissolved in warm water; 3 pounds of ground rice boiled to a\r\nthin paste and stirred in while hot; half a pound of Spanish whiting and\r\n1 pound of glue, previously dissolved by soaking in cold water, and then\r\nhanging over in a small pot hung in a larger one filled with water. Add\r\n5 gallons of hot water to the mixture, stir well and let it stand for a\r\nfew days, covered from dirt. It should be applied hot, for which purpose\r\nit can be kept in a portable furnace. A pint of this mixture, if\r\nproperly applied, will cover a square yard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitewash for Spray Pump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you give a recipe for a durable whitewash which can be prepared\r\nsimply and in large quantities? The whitewash will be applied with a\r\nspray pump.\r\n\r\nTo 25 pounds of lime, whole, slacking with 6 gallons of water, add 6\r\npounds of common salt and 1 1/2 pounds of brown sugar. Stir and mix well\r\nand allow to cool. When cool stir in 1 ounce of ultramarine blue. Then\r\nadd 2 gallons of water, and sprinkle and stir in 2 pounds of Portland\r\ncement. If two coats are to be applied, add 1 more gallon of water.\r\nStrain for work on smooth surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nButtermilk Paint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is paint made with buttermilk for farm buildings?\r\n\r\nOne gallon buttermilk, 3 pounds of Portland cement, and sufficient\r\ncoloring matter to give the desired shade. Apply as soon as made, and\r\nstir a great deal while being applied. It is said to dry in about 6\r\nhours and to be a good preservative for fences, barns and other\r\noutbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrespassing Live Stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a fence law in this State? In other words, do I have to fence\r\nagainst my neighbors' stock, or does the law require him to care for his\r\nstock and keep it off my property?\r\n\r\nThe old \"no-fence law\" which was enacted during the troubles between\r\nwheat growers and stock rangers has been put out of commission by more\r\nrecent legislation. The trespassing live stock is liable for damage, but\r\njust how to proceed to protect yourself you should learn from a local\r\nlawyer who knows statutes and your county ordinances also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRat-Proof Granary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I make a rat-proof granary for alfalfa meal and barley?\r\n\r\nOmit all boarding of the sides below the floor level and place a heavy\r\ninverted pan, milk pan, between the top of each of the supporting posts\r\nand the floor beams. Care should be taken that the diagonal bracing of\r\nthe underpinning or posts does not allow a rat to secure a foot hold\r\nnear enough the floor to permit of gnawing through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete Stable Floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a concrete floor good for a horse stable?\r\n\r\nConcrete floors are satisfactorily used for horse stables, provided the\r\nfloor is ribbed or otherwise roughened in a way to reduce the danger of\r\nslipping. Some stablemen have stall floors made that way. Some use a\r\nwooden grating over the concrete in places where the horses have to\r\nstand for any length of time. Others soften the standing by free use of\r\nbedding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilo-Heating Not Dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any danger of a barn burning from spontaneous combustion due to\r\na silo being built in the barn?\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of the silo overheating and setting fire to a barn.\r\nWhen the ensilage is curing, it often gets warm, but never anywhere near\r\nthe point of combustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Make Shingles Durable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best material with which to coat the shingles on my barn\r\nroof?\r\n\r\nThe best coating is a wood preservative, the principal ingredient of\r\nwhich is creosote. There are several reliable brands of preservatives\r\nand stains that may be had at a cost of about half that of paint. We\r\nmust remark also the natural durability of redwood shingles in this\r\nclimate if the roof has a good pitch. We reshingled our house roof after\r\n20 years of use and found the shingles so sound that we turned them and\r\nshingled the sides and roof of a shed with them where they promise to be\r\ngood for another score of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Breed of Hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best breed of hogs for pen feeding, shutting them up in\r\nsmall pens from the time they are little pigs and feeding them mostly on\r\nskim milk and slops?\r\n\r\nThere is no best breed. It is a matter of personal preference. Any of\r\nthe breeds are all right to pen up and feed. The principal thing is to\r\nsee that the hogs are all pure bred and have not been crossed too often\r\nto cause deterioration. Choose one breed of hogs and keep them as pure\r\nas possible and you will have no trouble in raising them. All the breeds\r\nare good; but some are fancied more than others. Dark-colored hogs are\r\npreferred in California because less liable to sunburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart VI. Feeding Farm Animals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeed for Plow-Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile doing heavy plowing, how many pounds of rolled barley per day\r\nshould I feed to keep 1300-pound horses in good condition? If I feed\r\npart oat hay and part alfalfa hay, together with rolled barley, what\r\nration would be ample?\r\n\r\nA ration used by the California Experiment Station was 12 pounds of\r\nalfalfa hay, 11 pounds of wheat hay and 7 pounds of crushed barley for\r\n1000 pounds of horse at hard work. The larger the horse the less food\r\nfor the amount of work he does in proportion to his size, so multiplying\r\nthese figures by 1.2 would bring a person somewhere near the ration for\r\na 1300-pound horse, and an approximation is as close as one can come to\r\nany general ration. Probably more alfalfa and less of the other feeds\r\ncould well be given, since many farmers are succeeding in feeding\r\nalfalfa exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVetch for Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes vetch make good feed for horses? Will vetch produce a heavier crop\r\nthan grain? When is the best time to sow vetch for hay, and what is the\r\nbest variety?\r\n\r\nVetch makes excellent stock feed whether used as hay or as pasturage.\r\nVetch falls to the ground so badly that it is very difficult to cut hay\r\nfrom it unless some grain is planted to hold it up. Oats make an\r\nexcellent hold-up crop and is more generally used. A half a bushel of\r\nvetch seed is mixed with a bushel of oats and this is enough to plant an\r\nacre. Some growers, however, prefer a bushel of vetch as that makes the\r\nstand much heavier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorghum Feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I allow milk cows to pasture on growing Kaffir and Egyptian corn\r\nduring the summer? Which one is the best for pasture and milk?\r\n\r\nThere is no difference between Kaffir corn and Egyptian corn so far as\r\nfeeding goes. They are both sorghums. There is a danger in pasturing on\r\nyoung sorghums, because stock is often killed from overeating it, and\r\nthey are quite apt to do this when they come upon it from dry feed. If\r\nyou cut and wilt the young sorghum, or if it is fed sparingly with hay,\r\netc., it becomes innocent of injury. After the sorghum has obtained\r\nconsiderable growth, it also loses its dangerous character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalting Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of salt is used for salting hay, how much to use and how to\r\napply it?\r\n\r\nAny good commercial salt such as is used for pork or beef packing is\r\nsatisfactory for salting hay. A good handful to the ton, scattering it\r\nas the hay is stocked is as good a formula as can be had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is stover? How is it cut and handled?\r\n\r\nStover is corn fodder after the ears are taken off. The best time to cut\r\nthe corn for stover is immediately after the kernel becomes dented and\r\nthe leaves or blades commence to dry. Immediately after the ears are\r\ntaken off, the stalks should be cut and stacked. The size of the shock\r\ndepends upon the climate. If it is a foggly climate and stalks are\r\ngreen, it is better to make a smaller shock, but in the interior valley\r\nwhere the weather is warm it is best to make large shocks, so that the\r\nstacks will not dry up very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeed for Cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat shall I feed cows when they are fresh and when they are dry!\r\n\r\nWhen they commence to freshen, give some green feed, such as alfalfa or\r\ncorn; if possible, also give, say, two or three pounds of barley or\r\nbran, and gradually increase this for two or three weeks until six or\r\nseven pounds of bran or barley is being fed. Also give a small amount of\r\nhay. Bran may be rather expensive feeding and a substitute is being\r\nused. Take four parts of barley to one of bran and mix. With barley at\r\nits low price, this makes rather inexpensive feeding. Another substitute\r\nis to take the chopped alfalfa hay and barley. These are mixed\r\nthoroughly together and moistened. After the cow freshens and gives her\r\nfull flow of milk, let her eat all the alfalfa hay she wants. A good\r\nration is about 15 to 20 pounds of hay, 6 or 7 pounds of barley or bran\r\nand about 10 pounds of roots such as beets or mangels. When the cow is\r\ndry, pasture is the best food, supplemented with some green food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorghum Silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Egyptian corn make good ensilage and at what time should it be cut\r\nto make the best feed for dairy cows?\r\n\r\nSorghum makes good silage. It must be cut while surely juicy enough, for\r\nit is a little more apt to dry out than Indian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley for Hay Feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the barley for hog feeding be rolled, ground or fed whole, dry or\r\nwet? Also, how much should be fed and how often to get best results?\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best results, the barley should be ground into a meal (not\r\ntoo fine) and have the hulls screened or floated out. This is best fed\r\nwhen made into a thick slop. Some good feeders believe in letting it\r\nstand until fermentation sets up, that is, gets a little sour. We prefer\r\na sweet to a sour feed. However, hogs will do well on either, provided\r\nthere is no change from sour to sweet. The change is the bad part. Hogs\r\nshould be fed just the amount that they will clean up well, and no more.\r\nA hog should always be ready for his feed at feeding time. We would not\r\nfeed oftener than twice a day: night and morning. - Chas. Goodman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSugar Beets and Silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill sugar beets keep in a silo and how sugar beets rank as a hog feed?\r\n\r\nSugar beets would probably keep all right if stored in a silo just as\r\nthey might if kept in any other receptacle, but it is not necessary to\r\nstore beets for stock-feeding in this State. They can be taken from the\r\nfield, or from piles made under open sheds in which the beets may be put\r\nbecause more convenient for feeding than to take them from the field in\r\nthe rainy season. Beets put whole into a silo would not make silage. For\r\nthat purpose they would need to be reduced to a pulp, but there is no\r\nobject in going to the expense of that operation where beets will keep\r\nso well in their natural condition and where there is no hard freezing\r\nto injure them. Beet pulp silage is made from beets which are put\r\nthrough a pulping process for the purpose of extraction of the sugar\r\nand, therefore, best pulp silage is only made in connection with\r\nbeet-sugar factories and is a by-product thereof which is proving of\r\nlarge value for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Value of Spelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the food value of spelt? It is a Russian variety of wheat, and\r\nyet, I am informed, it has about the same value as a stock food that\r\nbarley has.\r\n\r\nWe have no analysis of spelt at hand. It is presumably like that of\r\nbarley, as you suggest, because the spelt has an adhering chaff as\r\nbarley has. This fact makes it better for feeding than wheat, not in\r\nnutritive content, but because the chaff tends to distribute the starchy\r\nmaterial, making it more easily digestible; just as barley and oats are\r\nbetter than ordinary wheat for stock feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentrates and Corn Stalks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to feed mulch cows any hay or concentrated feed in\r\naddition to green corn stalks?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary. Green corn is an excellent thing for milch cows, but it\r\nis a very unbalanced ration and needs alfalfa or something else to\r\nbalance it up. Green corn, for example, contains only about one per cent\r\nof digestible protein and 11.5 per cent of digestible carbohydrates and\r\n0.4 per cent fat, or a nutritive ratio of about 1 to 12 1/2. A proper\r\nration would be about 1 to 6 or 7, or less. To balance this up alfalfa\r\ncan be fed better than anything else in California, for that is very\r\nrich in protein and the cheapest supply of protein that there is. If you\r\ngive the cows a good supply of alfalfa hay with the green corn, you will\r\nhave an ideal combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDry Sorghum Fodder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Egyptian corn fodder good for cows? I have been told it would dry up\r\nthe milk. I have several acres and would like to feed it if it is not\r\nharmful.\r\n\r\nDry sorghum fodder is counted about the poorest roughage that one would\r\nthink of harvesting. It is much less valuable than Indian corn fodder.\r\nEgyptian corn is one of the non-saccharine sorghums which are valuable\r\nboth for grain or for green feeding. We never heard of direct\r\nmilk-drying effect, though such a result might be expected from feeding\r\nsuch innutritive material, which is also difficult of digestion. If fed\r\nfor roughness it should be in connection with concentrated foods like\r\nbran or oil meal or with green alfalfa. No cow can give much milk when\r\nthe feed is hardly nutritive enough to keep her alive.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be, however, much difference in the dry fodders from\r\ndifferent varieties of sorghum. One grower writes: \"Kaffir corn is the\r\nonly variety within our knowledge of which the fodder is of much value.\r\nWe consider the fodder much more preferable than that of the ordinary\r\nIndian corn, and our stock eat it much more readily than the sweet\r\nsorghum. However, it requires a much longer season in which to ripen\r\nthan does any of the other varieties, for which reason it is less\r\ndesirable to plant in midsummer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteers on Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much alfalfa hay will a two or three-year-old steer eat per day, and\r\nabout what is the gain in weight per day?\r\n\r\nA steer will clean up about 33 pounds per day. Steers will make about 1\r\n1/2 pounds gain in weight per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentrates with Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a good supply of alfalfa hay and have been feeding this as a\r\nstraight feed for my dairy cows. They are not, however, doing as well as\r\nthey should and I am looking for some good feed to go with it.\r\n\r\nYou could probably get better returns by feeding about a pound of\r\ncocoanut meal and three of dried beet pulp than by any other combination\r\nof concentrates with straight alfalfa. If you are producing market milk\r\nor butter prices justify it, more concentrates could profitably be fed.\r\nIt is an expensive proposition to build up a properly balanced ration\r\nwith alfalfa and concentrates alone, and unless market milk is being\r\nsold, it usually does not pay. The cheapest way to provide a balanced\r\nration is not by concentrates, but by wheat or other grain straw, and\r\nlet the cows eat all they care for. This is very cheap and helps to\r\nbalance a ration with green or dry alfalfa hay, is usually cheap, and is\r\nfine for cows. Both are much less expensive than concentrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChopping Hay for Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat saving may be made by chopping all oat hay when fed to horses?\r\n\r\nThere is no particular saving in chopping hay unless the horses are\r\nworked very hard and for very long hours, as is often the case with\r\nexpress horses in the cities, or unless the power for cutting is very\r\ncheap and feed high. The idea is that, except in unusual cases as above\r\nmentioned, the horses can do their own grinding cheaper than it can be\r\ndone by power. Somewhat less hay is wasted when fed cut than when fed\r\nlong, but if they are not fed too much long hay they will waste very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrain for Horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best formula for feeding work horses with oat hay, alfalfa,\r\nbarley (crushed) and corn as rations?\r\n\r\nFeed one-half oat hay and one-half alfalfa hay, about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds\r\nper day for each 100 pounds live weight of the horse. Add to this from\r\n3/4 to 1 pound of rolled barley or corn for each 100 pounds live weight.\r\nIf the corn is on the cob, four-fifths of its weight is corn; that is to\r\nsay, 5 pounds of corn on the cob has 4 pounds of grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Cut Alfalfa Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould alfalfa hay, cut, say, from one-half to three inches in length be\r\nbetter than whole hay for hogs, cattle and horses, and if it is better,\r\nshould it be fed wet or dry?\r\n\r\nCattle and horses do much better when fed chopped alfalfa hay than when\r\nfed whole hay. They can eat the required amount in much less time and\r\nwith less exertion. For cattle and horses the hay should be cut about\r\none inch long and fed dry. There is no advantage in chopping alfalfa hay\r\nfor hogs unless it is mixed with ground grain and made into slop. - L.\r\nP. Denny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStoring Cut Alfalfa Hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are planning on cutting our next season's crop of alfalfa with a feed\r\ncutter and storing it in a barn for winter feeding.\r\n\r\nThe hay must, of course, be thoroughly cured, because of the great\r\ndanger of heating in a tight mass. A. Balfour says: \"I have been cutting\r\nalfalfa into a barn for wo seasons. It is absolutely necessary to have\r\nthe sides and floor tight, and it is easier to feed it if it is in a\r\nloft. The hay is best stacked first, and must be thoroughly cured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Grinding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the curing of alfalfa for grinding different from ordinary; has it to\r\nbe chopped before grinding, and what is the cost of grinding?\r\n\r\nAlfalfa hay should be cut when the very first blossoms commence to\r\nappear. At this point the plant contains the greatest amount of protein;\r\nfrom that time on until seed time, the protein diminishes and fiber\r\nincreases. To make meal, hay should be well cured, have gone through the\r\nsweat, and should be dry, or as near dry as possible. It mills easier\r\nwhen dry and makes a finer product. It should be cured so as to retain\r\nthe green color. To grind it, it is not necessary to cut it before\r\ngrinding, it mills better if ground just as it comes from the stack. The\r\ncost of milling hay varies with the size of the machine, condition of\r\nhay, whether dry or damp, or whether tough or tender. With larger plants\r\nof a capacity of four to five tons per hour, it costs about 45 cents a\r\nton to put it in the sack, exclusive of the cost of sacks; and with\r\nsmaller, it runs from that on up to $1 to $2 per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Calves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow soon can calves be weaned and not hinder their growth? After\r\nweaning, what would you advise to feed them?\r\n\r\nAfter the calf has once nursed, it should be taken away from its mother,\r\nbut fed its mother's milk for a few days, depending on the vigor of the\r\ncalf. Commence to add skim-milk after a week or ten days, adding a small\r\namount at first and increasing it daily until the calf is on an entirely\r\nskim-milk diet. The milk must be sweet, it must be as warm as its\r\nmother's milk and the calf must not have too much of it. Four quarts at\r\na feed twice a day is sufficient for the average sized calf for the\r\nfirst month, then increase it accordingly. Add a spoonful of ground\r\nflaxseed to each feed and teach the calf to eat a little grain as soon\r\nas possible. Ground barley is the most economical feed to balance a\r\nration containing so much skim-milk. If calves show a tendency to\r\nlooseness of the bowels, feed less milk, and when this does not remedy\r\nthe trouble, heat some skim-milk to boiling and when it is cooled to a\r\nproper temperature feed this to the calf. A good grain ration to feed\r\ncalves along with skim-milk is ground barley with green alfalfa hay.\r\nWhen the milk is cut off, feed barley and bran soaked with molasses\r\nwater. Put a pint of molasses in a pail of water and dampen feed with\r\nit. This amount will dampen three bushels of feed. - W. M. Carruthers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Feed for Sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best to sow for sheep pasture - barley, oats, rye, vetch\r\nor rape?\r\n\r\nOf the grains, rye is usually found to be best for quick winter growth,\r\nand rye and vetches sown together are very satisfactory, because the rye\r\nholds the vetches up so that the whole growth can be more successfully\r\nhandled with the mower, and if grown that way and fed green in a corral,\r\na very large amount of good feed can be secured. Sufficient experiments\r\nhave not yet been made with rape to fully demonstrate its value. Even if\r\nit grew well, it would be inferior in nutritive value to vetches and\r\nrye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBalanced Rations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a balanced ration for milk cows and brood sows?\r\n\r\nWhen plenty of alfalfa is available many dairymen feed that alone. It is\r\nbetter to feed a little corn, grain hay, beet pulp or the beets\r\nthemselves to balance up the ration. Some of the best concentrates to\r\nfeed to offset alfalfa hay are ground barley and dried beet pulp. The\r\nsame thing can be said about the sows. They will consume about 10 pounds\r\nof chopped alfalfa per day and all the skim-milk that is likely to be\r\ngiven them. Not more than eight pounds of concentrates need be fed, of\r\nwhich one-fifth may be bran, the same amount, or more, of cocoanut oil\r\ncake, and the rest corn or barley. With plenty of skim-milk and alfalfa,\r\nbut little grain or other concentrates will be needed. A few beets will\r\nalso go well with alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPasture and Cover Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am thinking of sowing burr clover with rye to be plowed under in the\r\nspring. Is it good policy to sow rye with clover?\r\n\r\nBurr clover and rye would be very satisfactory for sowing, after the\r\nrains, to secure a winter growth for plowing under in March or April, or\r\nearlier if the growth should be large enough to warrant. Such a cover\r\ncrop can be pastured lightly to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutting Corn for Silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best time to cut corn for the silo? What length is it cut?\r\nIs water put on it when it is put in the silo?\r\n\r\nThe best time to cut corn for the silo is just as the kernels are\r\nbeginning to glaze. It is cut with a proper ensilage cutter into half or\r\nthree-quarter inch lengths. No water is used, unless the corn should be\r\nunusually dry, with shriveled leaves; in that case, the use of water to\r\ncompensate for the loss of moisture in the stalks and leaves is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFall and Winter Pasturage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you advise for planting in the fall for winter pasture in the\r\nSacramento valley? Are field peas suitable?\r\n\r\nThe common California field pea, called Niles pea, the Canadian pea, the\r\ncommon vetch (which is sometimes called the Oregon vetch because the\r\nseed is largely grown in that State) are all suitable for fall planting\r\nand winter growth because they are not injured by ordinary valley\r\nfrosts. Aside from legumes, you can get winter feed from fall-sown rye,\r\nEssex rape or kale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Pasture for Hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to pasture hogs in the San Joaquin valley this spring and summer.\r\nHave water for irrigation, but will not have time to get alfalfa started\r\nsufficient to pasture.\r\n\r\nSorghum can be planted with pumpkins or some root crop between the rows.\r\nThe root crop or the pumpkins could be used in the later summer, while\r\nthe sorghums could come between the natural grasses of the early spring\r\nand the root crops. A strictly pasturage scheme is to sow wheat or\r\nbarley and turn the hogs on this, so that they will eat within certain\r\nprescribed limits. In order to do this, the field needs a shifting\r\nfence, so that the hogs can be driven from one section to another -\r\nnever letting the hogs eat too closely, as they will kill off the stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSize of a Silo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am planning to build a silo 8 feet high and 10 feet across. Will\r\nensilage (corn, oats) keep well in a silo of those dimensions?\r\n\r\nThe silo you are intending to build is too shallow, and would hold only\r\na very small amount of silage. There would be several inches loss of\r\nsilage before you could start feeding, and you would have to feed at\r\nleast two and probably three inches off per day in order to keep the\r\nfood from spoiling. Sixty inches of silage would thus only last about\r\ntwenty days. Also, the deeper a silo is, the tighter the ensilage is\r\npacked and the more will be contained in a cubic foot. The following\r\ntable will give suggestions as to dimensions:\r\n\r\nDiameter.   Height.   Capacity.     Diameter.   Height.    Capacity.\r\n10 feet     25 feet    36 tons      14 feet     34 feet    115 tons\r\n10  \"       28  \"      42  \"        15  \"       34  \"      131   \"\r\n11  \"       29  \"      60  \"        16  \"       35  \"      158   \"\r\n12  \"       32  \"      73  \"        20  \"       35  \"      258   \"\r\n13  \"       33  \"      83  \"\r\n\r\nA cow can consume four tons of silage in 180 days and more or less as\r\nyou care to feed, so by figuring out how long you will probably feed,\r\nyou can see the size of silo to build at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoiling Crops in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the dates for planting crops to be used for soiling in your\r\nState?\r\n\r\nWe are using Indian corn and sorghums of various kinds for soiling to a\r\ncertain extent. There is also some cutting and carrying of alfalfa,\r\nalthough most of the alfalfa is pastured. Dates of planting depend upon\r\nthe frost-free period; sometimes beginning in April, and successive\r\nplanting for later growth as water may be available for irrigation.\r\nThere are places where one can see standing corn and sorghum untouched\r\nby frost as late as December 1. In other locations the growth of these\r\nplants have to be made between May and September. We have also\r\nwinter-soiling practiced to a small extent in this State and for that\r\npurpose rye and barley sown at the beginning of the rainy season are\r\nused to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewer's Grains for Cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre sprouted barley grains that may be had from breweries good for milch\r\ncows? Will it increase the milk, or will it dry up the cows?\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry, in his standard work on \"Feeds and Feedings,\" says:\r\n\"Fresh brewer's grains constitute one of the best feeds for the dairy\r\ncow. She is fond of them and they influence most favorably the flow of\r\nmilk. Fed while fresh in reasonable quantities, supplemented by bright\r\nhay or corn fodder for dry feed, the grains being kept in tight\r\nfeed-boxes which can be kept clean, and with other conditions favorable\r\nto the healthfulness of the cow, no valid objection can be raised\r\nagainst this form of feed. From 20 to 30 pounds of wet grains should\r\nconstitute a day's allowance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Pumpkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper way to feed pumpkins to cows? Some say to cut them in\r\nhalves; while others say they must be chopped fine enough so that the\r\ncows cannot choke on them. Some tell me the seeds tend to dry the cows\r\nup, and should not be fed with pumpkins.\r\n\r\nPumpkins should be either cut in halves or broken in large fragments so\r\nthat the stock can get a bite at them or else should be chopped fine,\r\nand we could never see the advantage of going to that trouble. Cutting\r\ninto medium-sized pieces is dangerous because of the temptation to\r\nswallow them whole and thus getting choked. It is not necessary to\r\nremove the seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding a Family Cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat shall I feed family Jersey cow in addition to alfalfa hay to insure\r\na good supply of milk?\r\n\r\nOne of the best things to feed in addition to alfalfa hay is a couple of\r\nquarts of middling or bran twice a day, with which is mixed a cup of\r\nmolasses with enough water to make a nice paste. Dried beet pulp is\r\nexceptionally good with alfalfa, if it is available, this also to be\r\nmoistened before feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRolled Barley for Cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill rolled barley hurt milk cows, say two light feeds a day? Will it\r\nnot do about as much good as the same amount of bran?\r\n\r\nCertainly not and otherwise will be good if not used in excess to\r\nencourage fattening. Bran is a better feed for milk because it has a\r\nhigher protein content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorse Beans and Pie-melons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it pay me to raise horse beans for fattening hogs? Horse beans do\r\nwell. Would citrons do well there without irrigation, and would they be\r\nbetter than stock-beets for hog feed?\r\n\r\nWe do not promise anyone that anything will pay. Horsebeans are good\r\nwith other feeds for hogs. Theoretically, they will balance well with\r\npie-melons and beets, and both the latter will produce well on good land\r\nwith proper cultivation in the valley you mention. Theoretically, also,\r\nwe would rather have beets than pie-melons. The hogs will tell you the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorse Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre \"horse beans\" a leguminous crop and how does their feeding value for\r\nhogs compare to cowpeas and Canadian field peas?\r\n\r\nThey surely are legumes, and they resemble so closely in composition the\r\nother legumes which you mention that their feeding value would be\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStoring Stock Beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best method of storing stock beets and stock carrots in this\r\nclimate? We can let them remain in the ground and grow until February or\r\nMarch and would like to preserve them for feeding as long as possible.\r\n\r\nStock beets and carrots can be stored in California without recourse to\r\ncovering with ground or use of a cellar. They keep very well during the\r\nwinter if piled under cover in such a way as to keep cool and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKale for Cow Feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is kale worth for cow feed as compared with alfalfa, also can it be\r\ncut and cured the same as alfalfa and what variety is the best?\r\n\r\nKale is very similar to cabbage in growth, and for feeding purposes. For\r\ncow feed it would have about three-fourths the amount of digestible\r\nnutrients as green alfalfa, but would have an added value on account of\r\nits succulency. It would go especially well with alfalfa hay. The Jersey\r\nor Thousand-Headed kale is considered the standard for stock or poultry\r\nfeed. It is always fed fresh and is not made into hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Kind of Beet for Stock?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich would be most valuable to plant on river-bottom land for cattle\r\nand hog feed, sugar beets or mangels?\r\n\r\nGrow a large stock of beet by all means - either a mangel or a tankard.\r\nUsually you will get more weight than with sugar beets; the cost of\r\nharvesting is far less, and the nutritive contents high enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping Pumpkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way of storing pumpkins, under ordinary farm\r\nconditions, in a climate such as we have here in northern California? I\r\nhave no facilities for cold storage.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do in this climate to keep pumpkins is to keep them out\r\nof reach of the stock. They do not need storage of any kind, but will\r\nkeep in good condition during the late autumn and winter months in any\r\nopen-air place where they may be convenient for feeding purposes. In\r\nparts of California where there is hard ground freezing, protection must\r\nbe given by covering with boards or straw or any other material\r\navailable. We have no need for root cellars or cold storage, for our\r\nwinter temperatures are neither high nor low enough to hurt them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Pomace as Hog Feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the value of grape pomace as a hog feed?\r\n\r\nIt has been sold for 50 cents a ton as it comes from the press at the\r\nwinery and when a person has not got any surplus of other feeds, it is\r\nevidently worth that and then some. The only way to feed it is to put it\r\nup in a big pile and let the hogs take it as they want it. It will help\r\nkeep them growing through the winter provided they have other feed with\r\nit that might not be sufficient without the pomace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProper Feeding of Young Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I put two 50-pound shoats to an acre of barley that will yield 10 or\r\n12 sacks of grain, how many months could they be kept there to\r\nadvantage, and what gain could I expect them to make in that time?\r\n\r\nIf the pigs have been properly fed and were of good stock, they should\r\nhave attained a weight of 50 pounds at three or four months of age. Pigs\r\nin this condition would be more likely to lose than gain turned on a dry\r\nbarley field, even if the yield were double what you state. Barley is an\r\nexcellent fattener for mature hogs, but is a poor food for young growing\r\npigs. Young pigs should have a balanced ration, which may be defined as\r\na little of almost all kinds of feed and not all of any one kind. We\r\nhave pigs running on a barley field such as you describe, and in\r\naddition to the barley we feed them once a day a slop composed of wheat\r\nmiddling and bran in equal parts by measurement, to which we add about 8\r\nper cent tankage, and they seem to be moving along nicely. Without the\r\nslop we don't think they would hold their own. - Chas. Goodman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPie-melons and Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 14 sows which were fed almost entirely on pie-melons and milk,\r\nnot much of the latter. Out of the 14, only 3 sows have saved any pigs;\r\nthe rest lost all the young they had. Four or five sows that for the\r\nlast three weeks have had no melons, nothing but green grass and a\r\nlittle whole barley each day, are saving their pigs all right.\r\n\r\nPie-melons are poor feed and pigs which are not given anything better\r\nought to fail. \"Green grass and a little whole barley\" is much better\r\nfeed than pie-melons. Pie-melons are useful fed with alfalfa hay or some\r\nricher food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat or Barley for Hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich would be the better grain for me to buy for hog feed; wheat at\r\n$1.30 per hundred, or barley at $1? Would it be worth paying 10 cents a\r\nhundred for rolling, and then haul the grain 8 miles by wagon?\r\n\r\nWheat is only considered about 10 per cent more valuable as a hog feed\r\nthan barley, so that in your case, barley at $1 is the cheaper. In\r\nBulletin 80 of the Oregon Station it was found that crushed wheat was 29\r\nper cent more efficient than the whole grain, and it is safe to say that\r\nbarley will run about the same, enough so at any rate to pay the extra\r\n10 cents a hundred for crushing and the hauling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrain and Pasture for Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the most profitable amount of grain to feed to spring pigs while\r\non alfalfa pasture, from the time of weaning to the time of marketing?\r\n\r\nWe doubt the profit of feeding whole grain to hogs of any age while on\r\ngreen pasture. On almost all kinds of land they will get enough grit to\r\nkeep their teeth sore, hence they will not masticate the grain\r\nthoroughly. Perfect mastication is very essential. We would feed the\r\npigs all the slop that they would clean up good twice a day. The slop to\r\nbe composed of equal parts of corn, barley meal ground fine, and wheat\r\nmiddlings mixed with milk. There is nothing in all the world like milk\r\nfor growing pigs. If milk is not to be had, we would add from 5 to 10\r\nper cent meat meal, which we consider next to milk. If whole grain is to\r\nbe used, it should be thoroughly cooked on account of the pigs' teeth\r\nnot being in condition to chew the hard grain. - Chas. Goodman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Pigs on Roots and Barley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can raise all kinds of root crops, such as carrots, sugar beets,\r\nrutabagas, etc., and cow peas and pumpkins do wonderfully well. Will\r\nhogs do well an that kind of diet, especially if given a little barley\r\nwith it?\r\n\r\nThe plants that you mention are good for hog feeding and can be used to\r\nadvantage with a little barley as you suggest. None of these plants are,\r\nhowever, rich in protein as alfalfa and the other clovers are. The\r\nreason why we get such a rapid and satisfactory growth of young hogs in\r\nCalifornia is due to the fact that they are largely kept on alfalfa and\r\nrapid growth is the product of a sufficient protein content in the\r\nfodder. Both common field peas and cowpeas do not possess this element,\r\nand if you can grow them they will serve as a substitute for the other\r\nlegumes, such as alfalfa. If you are feeding skim-milk, which is rich in\r\nprotein, roots and grain will go well with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat and Barley for Feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference in the feeding value of wheat and barley for hogs\r\nand horses?\r\n\r\nThere is very little difference in the chemical composition of wheat and\r\nbarley. In their physical condition there is much difference, chiefly\r\nbecause of the adhering chaff of the barley, which makes it more\r\ndigestible because it separates the starchy mass and enables the gastric\r\njuice to work upon the particles more readily and quickly. Oats also\r\nhave this character. This is very important in the case of horses, which\r\ncan quickly be put out of condition by feeding wheat. For hogs and\r\nchickens it makes much less difference, and the absence of the chaff\r\ngives a greater amount of nutritive matter to the ton, so that wheat is\r\nworth more at the same ton price. But look out about giving horses too\r\nmuch wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII. Diseases of Animals\r\n\r\nThis division is largely compiled from the writings of Dr. E. J. Creely\r\nof the San Francisco Veterinary College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbscess of Parotid Gland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy horse has had a bad cold and it has a large lump on its neck which\r\nkeeps running and does not seem to get any better; it has been running\r\nfor two weeks.\r\n\r\nThis horse has an abscess of the parotid gland and the abscess should be\r\nopened large enough so that the finger can be introduced to break down\r\nadhesions, so that proper drainage can be established, after which wash\r\nout with a 5 per cent solution of permanganate of potash. As this is a\r\ndangerous location for a layman to interfere with, owing to the\r\nbranching of the carotid artery, pneumogastric nerve and jugular vein,\r\nit should be done by a qualified veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForage Poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast fall one of our horses was taken ill and had a swollen jaw. He died\r\nsoon and we supposed that he had been kicked and died of lockjaw. This\r\nspring another was taken ill. He began dragging around, making an effort\r\nto eat and drink, but not being able to swallow much. Something seemed\r\nwrong with his throat and his hind legs. In two or three days he got\r\ndown, seeming to have no strength in his back. He kept struggling for\r\ntwo days, not being able to swallow much; so we put him out of his\r\nmisery. Since then two others have gone off the same way.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is due to forage poisoning, caused by the eating food\r\ninfested with poisonous moulds. The symptoms are inability to swallow\r\n(paralysis of the muscles of deglutition) and paresis of the hind and\r\nforequarters. When the symptoms become advanced, treatment is of little\r\navail. However, further troubles can be prevented by ascertaining the\r\nfood which is infested with this mould. Ofttimes, however, such food may\r\nbe apparently clean to the eye. Make a complete change of food and a\r\nthorough cleaning of your stable and corrals of all old fodder which\r\nmight be in the mangers, or in any accessible place. Very frequently old\r\nfood which is left in the bottom of mangers becomes mouldy, and horses\r\npicking for grain which might be left in it, eat considerable quantities\r\nof this spoiled fodder, get poisoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Scabby Swelling.\r\n\r\nOne of my cows has a swelling on her hind leg with little scabs on it,\r\nfirst it was on the front leg. It is as big as your hand.\r\n\r\nUse the following, applied once daily: Olive oil, 1 pint; turpentine, 2\r\nounces; oil cedar, 2 ounces; lysol, 1 ounce; mix and apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Easement in Bloat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can be done for bloating?\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to be generally known that to put a bridle on a cow or\r\nput a stick in her mouth and tie tightly with a string or strap up over\r\nher head, so as to keep her jaws working, will relieve bloat. We have\r\ngiven common soda and salt with good results to our milk cows. Take a\r\nwhip and run her around the corral, after giving the soda. This\r\ntreatment causes the wind to pass off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFatal Skin Disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two months ago a horse was turned out in pasture. Several of the\r\nhorses in the pasture started to lose their hair. It seemed to fall away\r\nfrom the hide, and leave the skin exposed. The horse that was newly\r\nturned to pasture got the same disease and died. The other horses did\r\nnot die. The hair on the horse that had died had fallen off from the\r\nsides and hind legs.\r\n\r\nThis is gangrenous dermatis, a gangrenout inflammation of the skin. It\r\nis due to mould, must or vegetable fungi. Remove to a new pasture, give\r\nfood free from the fungi, and apply the following ointment to the skin:\r\nLanoline, 8 ounces; zinc oxide, 1 ounce; Pearson's Creoline, 1/2 ounce;\r\ntannin, 3 drachms; mix and apply once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShoulder Injury on Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA young mare that bruised her shoulder on the point with collar. It was\r\nlanced and now has a hard lump or callous, about three inches in\r\ndiameter. What is best to do? She is not lame, but it would interfere\r\nwith the collar.\r\n\r\nGet a qualified veterinarian to operate and entirely remove the growth\r\nor you may use the following mixture to see if it will not cause it to\r\npartly absorb and then use a dutch collar or a specially padded collar:\r\nCompound tinct. iodine, 4 ounces; sulphuric ether, 2 ounces; oil cedar,\r\n2 ounces; turpentine, 4 ounces; mix and apply once daily until\r\nblistered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorse with Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the best remedy for a horse that has worms? I would like to\r\nknow, as I have a horse that is getting poor with this trouble.\r\n\r\nMix 1/2 pound pulverized and dried iron sulphate and 1/2 pound\r\nbicarbonate of soda, and give one teaspoonful each morning until the\r\nmedicine is gone. After the last dose give the following: Turpentine, 2\r\nounces; fluid extract male fern, 1/2 ounce; Pearson's Creolins, 1 ounce;\r\nraw linseed oil, 1 pint. Mix and give all at one dose. To improve the\r\ngeneral condition one may give artificial Carlsbad salts, 1\r\ntablespoonful in each feed, and each dose to have added to it 3 to 5\r\ngrains arsenious acid. If plenty rock salt is allowed for horses to\r\nlick, they will be protected against intestinal parasites to a slight\r\nbut useful degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs It Mange?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a horse five years old that is always scratching and biting\r\nhimself as if he had mange or lice. He seems to itch more on his\r\nshoulders and front legs than any other place. We have washed him with a\r\ncarbolic wash, also with a tea made from tobacco, but so far have been\r\nunable to stop it. He often bites his legs below the knees until he\r\ntakes off all the hair and part of the skin. None of the other horses\r\nare, troubled, although this horse has been troubled for three years.\r\n\r\nApply the following: Lysol, 1 ounce; kerosene, 4 ounces; formalin, 2\r\ndrachms; cotton seed oil, 9 ounces. Mix and apply once daily after\r\nwashing with hot sheep dip solution 10 to 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorse with Itch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor about a year my horse has been itching so badly that he has rubbed\r\noff all the hair on certain parts of his body. Lately he bites his tail.\r\n\r\nWhitewash the stall once weekly, scrub the harness, brushes, combs and\r\nevery stable appliance that he has come in contact with. Don't use the\r\nsame appliance on other animals that you use on this horse. Use the\r\nfollowing mixture once daily on affected spots: Milk of sulphur, 4\r\nounces; tincture of iodine, 4 ounces; turpentine, 4 ounces; kerosene, 16\r\nounces; cottonseed oil, 120 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Bowel Trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to relieve a horse that balls up on alfalfa at the time of\r\nthe first symptoms? I have been bothered considerably with this, and\r\nalthough I know the symptoms, I can never seem to relieve the pain\r\nbefore the veterinary is called.\r\n\r\nGive the following prescription: Fluid extract Cannabis Indica, 3\r\nounces; sulphuric ether, 2 ounces; spirits turpentine, 3 ounces; oil\r\npeppermint, 10 drops; raw linseed oil, 24 ounces. Mix. Give one-half at\r\nonce, balance in one hour. If not relieved give several hotwater\r\nsoap-sud injections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbnormal Thirst of Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a horse with an abnormal desire for water. I notice that in\r\ndrinking she always wants more than the others. I also notice she\r\nperspires more freely in the harness and even will sweat in the barn at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nYour horse has kidney affection, probably due to feeding hay rich in\r\nalkalines. Treatment: Change the feed and give 1 quart of thick flaxseed\r\ntea three times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly recommend a treatment for a horse troubled with scours. He is on\r\ndry feed, but the trouble continues.\r\n\r\nGive very little water mornings and while worked, but give plenty at\r\nnight. Feed dry rolled oats, oat hay, one handful of whole flaxseed at\r\nnight, and the following powder: Bismuth subgalate, 4 ounces; iron\r\nsulphate, dessicated, 8 ounces; bismuth subnitrate, 8 ounces. Mix, and\r\ngive a heaping teaspoonful each morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepraved Appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a colt about one year old that continually delights in chewing up\r\nharness, ropes, chews on the manger and, in fact, anything it can get a\r\nhold of.\r\n\r\nThis is a condition caused by something being lacking in the system\r\n(lime, salts, etc.). Give plenty of salt, good food, grain, etc. Get\r\nthis prescription: Iron sulphate, 2 ounces; soda syposulphate, 4 ounces;\r\nGentian root pulv., 2 ounces; ginger, 1 ounce. Mix and give teaspoonful\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Dentist Needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an old horse which has always been fat and quite full of life\r\nuntil right lately. Now he is getting thin and looks bad. He eats his\r\nfood all right. I had his teeth fixed a few weeks ago. The man said they\r\nwere bad and he fixed them as well as he could.\r\n\r\nThere is probably an excessively long molar projecting into a cavity and\r\nthe projecting molar should be cut off by a qualified veterinarian. The\r\nhorse will begin to pick up and grow fat almost as soon as the condition\r\nis relieved. Most horse owners will permit every person with a float to\r\nruin a horse's mouth without inquiring whether the dentist possesses\r\nproper qualifications as certified by a State license and diploma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKidney Trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy horse has some trouble in passing water. What can I give him that may\r\nbe put in the mash? I don't think his trouble is due all to old age, for\r\nit didn't come on gradually.\r\n\r\nGive gran. sal nitre: a teaspoonful daily in water is good to stimulate\r\nthe kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Chronic Indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given my horse condition powders for indigestion, but her hair is\r\nrough still. Do you advise feeding on the road when a horse leaves the\r\nstable at 10 a. m., traveling continually for thirty miles, returning\r\n5:30 p. m., being fed at 7 a. m.?\r\n\r\nA great majority of condition powders contain resin and antimony. While\r\na slight amount may be beneficial, continued use results in affection of\r\nthe kidneys by over-stimulation. Give the following for indigestion:\r\nBismuth subintrate, 1 ounce; powdered pepsine, 1 ounce; soda bi\r\ncarbonate, 12 ounces; carbonate iron, 2 ounces. Mix and give a heaping\r\nteaspoon twice daily. By all means feed your horse three times daily and\r\nwater as often as you can. It is unnecessary to warn you that the horse\r\nmust not be overheated when you give the noonday feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWound Sore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy colt got its hind leg cut on barbed wire some weeks ago. There is a\r\nhole about an inch and one-half deep in the center of the sore which\r\nwill not heal. The inside of the sore does not seem very tender, but the\r\nleg stays swollen all of the time and is somewhat feverish.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a fistulous track that should be curetted by a\r\nveterinarian, after which the following formula could be used to heal:\r\nAcetanilide, 1/2 ounce; zinc oxide, 1/4 ounce; bismuth subgalate, 1 1/4\r\nounce. Mix and apply on cotton and bandage once daily after washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarts on Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can warts be removed from a horse's hide?\r\n\r\nWe use sulphuric acid. The results were favorable from the very start.\r\nThe warts rapidly shrunk away and finally disappeared entirely. The acid\r\nis applied to the crown of the wart with a small swab or similar\r\ninstrument, and only in sufficient quantities to wet the crown surface\r\nof the wart. It should be applied about three times a week until the\r\nwart is well reduced. Don't use too much acid, and don't keep up the\r\napplication too long - A. F. Etter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKidney Trouble in Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy for a horse that stops often to urinate while\r\nworking?\r\n\r\nThe horse is affected by an irritation of the kidneys. Give 1 quart of\r\nflaxseed tea daily, change the food and give 1 drachm of C. P.\r\nhydro-chloric acid in one bucket of drinking water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCastration of Colt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the correct and best way to castrate a yearling colt, with an\r\nemasculator or a blade, and when is the proper time?\r\n\r\nAn emasculator is the only instrument to use in castrating. The object\r\nin using any instrument is to prevent a hemorrhage, and nothing works\r\nwith so much certainty and quickness. The A. Hausman and Dunn\r\nemasculator is recommended. The proper time is when the weather is mild,\r\nthe grass at its best and the colt in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Chronic Cough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a mare seven years old that is troubled with a chronic cough,\r\nand at times shows symptoms of heaves, and also has occasionally a white\r\nfoamy discharge from the nostrils. She is a greedy eater and drinker and\r\nher excreta is often very offensive.\r\n\r\nIf she expels flatus when she coughs, this would indicate a\r\npredisposition to heaves. Wet all food, as dry or dusty food aggravates\r\nthe cough. Give the following: Spirits camphor, 4 ounces; Fl. Ext.\r\nbelladonna, 2 ounces; neutral oil, 8 ounces; oil eucalyptus, 2 ounces.\r\nMix and give tablespoonful three times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic Indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a mare eleven years old. Give her plenty of oats, hay, grain and\r\na little alfalfa hay three nights per week and leave salt where she can\r\nget at it, but she is falling off and her hair does not lie down\r\nproperly. She eats well and her system seems to be in good condition.\r\nHave had her teeth attended to so she chews her food well.\r\n\r\nThis condition is caused by the animal not being able to properly\r\nmasticate the food. Have your dentist examine the mouth again, or you\r\ncan carefully examine the feces and see if it shows whole grain, or long\r\npieces of hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Short-Wind or Heaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a mare that has something wrong with her wind. About six months\r\nago I noticed her wind was not good and she had a slight cough, and\r\nabout a week later, while working her, she seemed to choke down and\r\nalmost died before she got her wind, and since then she sometimes takes\r\nthose spells should she trot off briskly for a short distance.\r\n\r\nGive two 3/2-ounce doses of Fowler's solution arsenic daily. Dusty or\r\nmusty hay will aggravate the symptoms. Thoroughly shake out the dust and\r\nwet the hay. Feed hay only at night. Give the animal as little feed and\r\nwater as possible before being put to work. Continue this treatment one\r\nmonth if necessary. The following is a case of experience with this\r\ntreatment: For a remedial agent we began to use Fowler's Solution of\r\nArsenic, in two teaspoonful doses at first. once a day, put in the water\r\nwith which the hay was moistened. These doses were given for a few days,\r\nthen skipped for a day, then continued for five or six days again. This\r\ntreatment has been continued. At times when the trouble was most severe,\r\ngiving a great spoonful at a dose, twice a day for two days, then\r\nstopping for a day or two, always being sure to mix it with the water\r\nwhich the hay is moistened, so that it shall be taken into the stomach\r\nvery slowly. This course of treatment has served to so relieve the\r\ndisease that nature has nearly or quite overcome it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSide-Bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a 1500-pound 3-year-old colt with small brittle feet that has\r\nside bone coming on left front foot caused by driving him barefoot on\r\nthe road two or three months ago.\r\n\r\nA good blister of the following once every six weeks for three times\r\nwill stop the side-bones from growing. Side-bones on a draft horse are\r\nnot considered an unsoundness; in light fast drivers it is an incurable\r\nblemish causing lameness. Side-bones cannot be removed. Use this\r\nblister: Simple cerate, 4 ounces; cantharides, 3 drachms; bin iodide\r\nmercury, 2 drachms. Mix thoroughly and apply after clipping hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFungus Poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my mares, every evening after a full day's work harrowing, stands\r\nfor an hour or so with her head to the ground, shaking it frequently and\r\nnot touching the feed till the spell was over. She does not seem to be\r\nany worse off, and in the morning seems to be in good shape.\r\n\r\nThis is due to a mold or fungus in the earth or hay. Let them have\r\naccess to plenty of water during the day. In the morning feed give a\r\nhandful of sodium hyposulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment for Horse's Feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soles of the fore feet of a fine 4-year-old horse, weight 1350, are\r\nrather spongy and grow down faster than the hoof, sometimes causing\r\nslight lameness. He is not on soft pasture, but is stabled all the time.\r\nNow have bar shoes on him. What treatment do you recommend?\r\n\r\nUse leather, tar and okum and a dish-shoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a Cleft Hoof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a horse with a cracked hoof. One hind foot has been in a bad\r\ncondition, the other seems to be beginning to crack. Can anything be\r\ndone by feeding or otherwise to toughen the hoofs and render them less\r\nliable to crack?\r\n\r\nApply the following: Honey, 2 ounces; yellow wax, 4 ounces; tar, 2\r\nounces; olive oil, 8 ounces. Melt, mix and apply once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStiff Joints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a horse that was bruised on the ankle about two years ago. This\r\nis now producing an enlargement of the bone and stiffness of the joint.\r\n\r\nApply the following liniment: Sulphuric ether, 1 ounce; tinct. iodine, 1\r\nounce; pulv. camphor, 1 ounce; alcohol, ounces; turpentine, 2 ounces;\r\noil of cedar, 2 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment for Nail Puncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur horse got a nail in his foot. It was a wire nail, rusty, entering\r\nabout one inch from the point of the frog, and just puncturing far\r\nenough to reach a sensitive part of the hoof. It occurred six days ago;\r\nthe nail was pulled at once, the hoof cut open, and thoroughly cleaned\r\nwith turpentine (the first thing we could get), then later filled with\r\niodine. Since then I have kept on a flaxseed poultice.\r\n\r\nThe treatment with turpentine and iodine was proper and should prove a\r\nsuccess. If the foot becomes tender and inflamed, it will be because all\r\ndirt was not removed from the wound, and the poultice should be taken\r\noff, all foreign matter removed from the wound, and the treatment\r\nrepeated. In case of similar accidents, other disinfectants could be\r\nused in place of turpentine or iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPregnancy of Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any way to tell when a mare is in foal? I have had a\r\nveterinarian and he could not tell me.\r\n\r\nThere is no very good way to tell whether a mare is in foal for some\r\ntime. Practically speaking, the safest way to do is to have her bred\r\nevery time she comes in heat until she takes the stallion no longer.\r\nEven then some mares will come in heat a couple of times after getting\r\nin foal. If the sexual excitement speedily subsides and the mare\r\npersistently refuses the stallion for a month, she is probably pregnant,\r\nthough not surely so. Also if a vicious mare becomes gentle after\r\nservice it is an excellent indication of pregnancy; likewise pregnant\r\nmares will very often put on fat rapidly after conception and will be\r\nunable and unwilling to do as hard work as before. Enlargement of the\r\nabdomen, especially in its lower third, with slight falling in beneath\r\nthe loins and hollowness of the back are significant symptoms, though\r\nthey may be entirely absent. Swelling and firmness of the udder, with\r\nthe smoothing out of its wrinkles, is a suggestive sign, even though it\r\nappears only at intervals during gestation. A steady increase of weight\r\n(1 1/4 pounds daily) about the fourth or fifth month is a useful\r\nindication of pregnancy. The further along the mare is in gestation the\r\nmore pronounced the symptoms become. In the early stages it is naturally\r\nmuch more difficult to detect, especially with the great differences in\r\ndifferent mares. Cessation of heat and changes of disposition are about\r\nthe best signs in early stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseased Uterus of Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a brood mare that has given me two fine colts, but for the last\r\ntwo years I have not been able to get her with foal. She takes service\r\nand then refuses service for three or four months, and about the time I\r\ncome to the conclusion that she is safe with foal she will pass off\r\ngreat quantities of mattery substance. I have had her thoroughly washed\r\nout with Lysol previous to breeding, but so far she has repeated this\r\nperformance each time about three or four months after service.\r\n\r\nThis is a disease of the ovaries or uterus; perhaps mumification of a\r\nfoetus. Irrigate with a normal salt solution (teaspoon salt to each pint\r\nof warm water) only daily. Insert the solution through the neck of the\r\nwomb into the uterus. Give internally 1/2 ounce daily of Fowler's\r\nSolution of Arsenic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep-Seated Abscess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a mule which has a swelling on the throat about where the\r\nthroatlatch touches. It just seems to be swollen hard and not sore. I am\r\nusing caustic liniment to fester it so it will come to a head and I can\r\nopen it, but the liniment does not seem to do much good. The mule is\r\nlosing flesh and does not eat much.\r\n\r\nThis mule should be operated upon at once by a qualified veterinarian.\r\nThe application of liniments or blisters are useless; the knife only\r\nwill effect a cure. The fact that the mule is losing flesh makes the\r\ncase serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCure for Cocked Ankles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a 4-year-old mare that has cocked ankles, and would like to know\r\nwhat treatment to give her.\r\n\r\nCocked ankles are due to an inflammation of the tendons back of the\r\nankle and a drawing up or contraction in consequence. Put on heel calks\r\none inch, no toe, to rest and relieve the back tendons from strain.\r\nApply the following liniment at night, after which put on cold-water\r\nswabs and let them remain all night: Soap liniment, 8 ounces; tincture\r\niodine, 2 ounces; oil cedar, 4 ounces; sulphuric ether, 2 ounces. Mix\r\nand apply once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDehorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the best way to dehorn cows and calves?\r\n\r\nThe best time to dehorn cows is in the spring, before the fly season\r\nstarts. It is best not to have a cow too far along in calf before\r\ndehorning, as she is very apt to lose her calf. It is also better to\r\ndehorn before your cows freshen, because when cows are milking and are\r\ndehorned they will go back in their milk a great deal for the first\r\nmonth after the dehorning has taken place. Calves can be dehorned by\r\nblistering the little buttons before they adhere to the skull. This is\r\nvery simple and not painful. First clip the hair about the horns and wet\r\nthe little loose button and apply caustic potash, in stick form, by\r\nrubbing it on the damp horn. Remember, this must be done before the horn\r\nadheres to the skull. Also remember not to use water enough to run the\r\nlye away from the button and rub until the skin reddens. Also, look out\r\nto keep your end of the potash stick dry or you may dehorn the tips of\r\nyour fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis During Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow that will freshen in a few days. About six days ago she\r\nseemed weak in her hind legs and on going downhill would drag or stumble\r\nfor 10 or 12 feet, then catch herself and go on rather wobbly.\r\n\r\nPregnant animals about to bring forth their young sometimes show a\r\nparalysis or loss of power in their hind parts due to pressure of\r\nfoetus. Nature corrects this after birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBloody Milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can be done to stop bloody milk?\r\n\r\nMilk each teat in a separate glass jar, let stand to ascertain which\r\nteat the red specks are coming from, then milk the teats clean and\r\ninject the infected teat with equal parts of hydrogen dioxide and water.\r\nAfter a few hours inject 4 drachms of ferric chloride in 1 ounce of\r\nwater. Then milk clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Cleanse Cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cows are healthy and calves all right, but seem to have trouble\r\nthrowing the afterbirth.\r\n\r\nWash out twice daily with about 1 gallon of normal salt solution\r\n(teaspoonful of salt to each pint of warm water). Give internally the\r\nfollowing powder: Pulv. gentian, 4 ounces; puv. slippery elm, 1 ounce;\r\npuv. charcoal, 1 ounce; pulv. hyposulphate of soda. 8 ounces. Mix and\r\ngive a heaping teaspoonful twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment for Caked Bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow whose udder is caked hard and has been swollen from the\r\nudder to the forelegs. This latter swelling has gone down by applying\r\nequal mixture of turpentine and lard, but the udder itself still remains\r\nhard. When first noticed, one teat caked, then another, until all four\r\nare caked alike.\r\n\r\nInsert a milk tube and inject the following: Hydrogen dioxide, 8 ounces;\r\ntincture iron chloride, 1 ounce; water, 7 ounces. Inject into each\r\naffected teat. Apply the following externally: Camphorated oil, 8\r\nounces; tincture belladonna, 2 ounces; oil eucalyptus, 2 ounces. Mix and\r\napply twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGarget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow which gave rich milk all the time, but now every time I\r\nmilk her some yellow, hard substance will come out instead of milk.\r\nFirst from one teat, then the next, and when I strain the milk the\r\nstrainer will be full of hard yellow specks.\r\n\r\nYour cow has undoubtedly been affected with garget. This milk should not\r\nbe used. The condition is best treated by massaging the udder every day\r\nwith camphorated oil. It will also be necessary for you to continue to\r\nmilk her regularly until about six weeks before she is due to freshen,\r\nat which time you should proceed to dry her up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfectious Mastitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a 2-year-old heifer, which, two weeks before she was due to\r\nfreshen, had a large udder slightly caked. Upon pressing the teat a\r\ndischarge of blood issues from each teat.\r\n\r\nThis is infectious mastitis. It may be due to a bruise or blow or\r\ninfection introduced through the milk duct. The first is most likely.\r\nApply camphorated oil externally and inject into the affected udder some\r\nhydrogen dioxide (peroxide of hydrogen. - EDITOR.). After ten minutes,\r\nmilk out again. Repeat once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Mangy Cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a milk cow with some trouble about her head, neck and shoulders,\r\nwhich causes her to rub herself enough to make raw spots and take off\r\nmost all of the hair from the parts affected. The trouble has been\r\nstanding for 18 months, but I have been using medicine at different\r\ntimes, which stops the rubbing, and the part will cover with hair nicely\r\nagain, but in due time the trouble shows up again.\r\n\r\nThis cow seems to have mange or scabbies, which is caused by a parasite\r\nand is easily spread by contact to other cattle. It should be treated by\r\ntwo or three applications, ten days apart, of a hot solution of creolin,\r\nwell scrubbed into the skin. The solution is made by mixing five\r\ntablespoonfuls of creolin in a gallon of hot water. The treatment should\r\nbe applied pretty well over the body to cover all the affected parts,\r\nand needs to be repeated in ten days to destroy the younger generation.\r\nThe sheds should be cleaned and whitewashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrritation on Back of Udder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a yearling heifer which has sore teats and blotches just back of\r\nher bag which seem to itch. Her mother had a sort of eczema on her neck.\r\nI fear her sore teats will spoil her for milking when she comes in next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe following treatment is advised: Drench with 1 pound of Epsom salts\r\ndissolved in a couple quarts of water. The sores may be treated by\r\nwashing them with a 2 per cent solution of one of the coaltar\r\ndisinfectants, such as creolin. After the sores have been allowed to dry\r\nnaturally, a very little powdered calomel may be dusted thereon. Do this\r\nevery other day for a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlarged Gland on Neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a calf that has a lump on her neck, which appeared when she was\r\ntwo days old. The lump is getting larger.\r\n\r\nThis is probably an enlarged thyroid gland. Apply the following once\r\ndaily for several weeks and let it alone unless it becomes too large or\r\ngets very soft, which is unlikely. Churchill's tincture iodine, 8\r\nounces; turpentine, 1 ounce; sulphuric ether, 2 ounces; oil aniseed, 1/2\r\nounce. Mix and apply once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLumpy Jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my cows have hard lumps on their jaws, or lumpy jaw. Can that be\r\ncured, and how?\r\n\r\nThis is Actinomycosis (lumpy jaw) and is due to ray fungi (actinomyces)\r\nwhich are found originally on plants which enter the body in various\r\nways. The trouble usually appears in the upper or lower jaws of cattle,\r\nwhere it generally produces tumors of bone or soft tissues. For\r\ntreatment give 1 1/2 drachms of iodide of potash in 1/2 pint of water\r\ndaily for 14 days. Increase to 2 drachms for 14 more days, and then\r\ngradually decrease. Divide the tumor and insert gauze saturated with\r\ntincture of iodine for 4 days. In 8 days a visible improvement will be\r\nnoticed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Neck-Swelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cow has a swelling under her neck between her jaw bones about the\r\nsize of a baseball and almost as hard. It is not attached to anything\r\napparently, but largely suspended by the skin at the entrance to the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nCut directly through the center of the enlargement, clean to the bottom,\r\nsplitting it wide open. Clean it out with peroxide of hydrogen, after\r\nwhich saturate absorbent cotton with tincture iodine, pack in tight and\r\nsew the skin to hold it in place. Remove the dressing in 48 hours and\r\nwash with sheep dip (tablespoon to 1 quart of warm water) twice daily.\r\nThis may be tubercular, or the result of foxtail, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCow Chewing Bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my cows is continually chewing bones. What can I do to prevent\r\nit?\r\n\r\nGive the cow good clean hay; some root crop, cocoanut meal, bran or\r\nsoy-bean meal. If the cow does not stop mix in the drinking water twice\r\ndaily a little dilute hydrochloric acid. Also, have boxes arranged near\r\nfeeding stalls which contain wood ashes, slaked lime and salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwelling on the Dewlap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow that has a large lump at the point of the breastbone, the\r\ndewlap. This lump is as large as a cocoanut, and was caused, I think, by\r\nfriction against a low manger in eating.\r\n\r\nGet equal parts of tincture of iodine and soap liniment and rub onto the\r\nswelling twice daily for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarren Heifers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have three heifers, 3 years old, which have run with the bull right\r\nalong and have failed with calf; have had three different bulls to them;\r\nwhat can be done?\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility of contagious abortion causing these heifers to\r\nfail to breed. If this has occurred in the herd, the heifers are very\r\napt to be affected. If apparently healthy, reduce me feed and make the\r\nheifers take considerable exercise to reduce flesh. Give each a dram of\r\npowdered nux vomIca and one-half dram of dried sulphate of iron once\r\ndaily in a little feed. Breed to a healthy bull when the heifers come in\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sterile Cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a very fine Jersey cow. I have had her to the bull every month,\r\nand can't get her with calf.\r\n\r\nIn an isolated case of this kind there is probably some disease of the\r\ngenerative organs or some condition whereby the impregnation cannot\r\noccur even when the animal is bred. The ovaries may be cystic; there may\r\nbe chronic inflammation of the womb and possibly the mouth of the womb\r\nwas injured at last calf birth and the scar prevents its admitting the\r\nfertilizing cells. If possible, a veterinarian should make a careful\r\nexamination of this cow in order to determine what the trouble is.\r\nHowever, this treatment may be tried: About the time of coming in heat,\r\ngive the cow a large dose of glaubers salts (one pound) and the nux\r\nvomica and iron treatment advised for \"Barren Heifers\" in another\r\nparagraph. Before breeding the cow, apply a little extract of belladonna\r\nand glycerine to the mouth of the womb and breed a few hours after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupernumerary Teat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the upper part of one of the hind teats of a young Jersey cow that\r\nfreshened recently for the first time, there is a small growth from\r\nwhich the milk comes more plentifully than from the natural opening\r\nbelow. How, if at all, can this opening be closed without drying the\r\ncow? The milk from it runs all over the milker's hand and makes milking\r\nvery disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can be done until the cow is dry is to tie the small\r\nteat up before milking. This can be done with a string, rubber band, or\r\nan ordinary clamp. If it is so small that the opening cannot be tied,\r\nthere is nothing to do, except, perhaps to use, her as a nurse for\r\ncalves. Two of these might run with her at a time, making way for others\r\nas soon as they are able to look after themselves. Quite a number of\r\ncalves can sometimes be handled in a single year by a cow affected this\r\nway and the benefit to the calves might be nearly as much as by using\r\nthe cow for butter production. When the cow is dry the teat can be\r\namputated and the opening will close when the sore heals, or a stick of\r\nlunar caustic can be inserted into it, causing a wound that will heal\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfection of Udder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year one of my cows had milk fever which affected her udder. This\r\nyear after freshening she milked two months when she suddenly went dry\r\non one side of her udder. She is now badly stiffened up in her hind\r\nquarters and off her feed.\r\n\r\nThe cow has infectious mastitis due to introduction of some infection.\r\nGive a saline purge (1 pound. glauber salt), inject peroxide of\r\nhydrogen, after which pump in, sterile air. Apply externally camphorated\r\noil once daily. Camphorated oil has a tendency to dry up the secretion\r\nof the gland and is used advisedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLumps in Teats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cow has hard lumps in, her teats and lower part of the bag. These\r\ncause pain to her on milking, but there are no other symptoms of\r\ndisorder. This condition has prevailed several months.\r\n\r\nGive 1 drachm. iodide potash daily for one week; 2 drachms the second\r\nweek 3 drachms the third week, add reduce as you began. If tumors are\r\nsmall and interfere with the flow of milk they can be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWound in Teat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow with an open slit about one-fourth to one-third of an inch\r\nin the side of one teat. I have lacerated the edges and stitched the\r\nslit well together many times but the milk will ooze out and prevent\r\nhealing together. I have used numberless milk tubes to no avail, as the\r\nflange on the tubes loose out. When I remove the flange the tubes creep\r\nup into the udder and it is a trouble to get them out again.\r\n\r\nWounds of a quiescent udder usually heal, but if the cow is in milk and\r\nthe lesions involve the teats it is exceedingly difficult to heal the\r\nwound, as the irritation delays or interrupts the healing process. The\r\nfollowing lotion is one of the very best to use for teat wound: Tinct.\r\niodine, 2 ounces; tinct. arnica, 2 ounces; glycerine, 2 ounces; comp.\r\ntinct. benzoine, 2 ounces. Mix and apply twice daily after washing with\r\n5 per cent solution carbolic acid and castile soap. Your milk tube must\r\nbe an ancient one as all milk tubes of today are self-retainers and\r\ncould not slip into the udder. Care must be taken to boil the tube\r\nprevious to each using as you may cause an infection of the udder by a\r\nfilthy tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInjury to Udder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow which has a gathering in the back of her udder which seems\r\nto be some sort of injury. It has been there but a few days.\r\n\r\nThis injury was caused by a blow or traumatism. Thoroughly scrape out\r\nthe diseased tissue and after washing with sheep-dip water (tablespoon\r\nto one quart) apply the following powder: Mix the following powder and\r\napply it to the wound: Iodoform, 1 drachm; boric acid, 1 ounce; alum,\r\n1/2 ounce; zinc oxide, 1/2 ounce. Be sure and insert this powder into\r\nthe bottom of the wound, so that it will reach all diseased parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Teat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do for a \"blind teat\"? The cow has just freshened and that\r\nquarter of her udder is very full, but there is no milk in the teat. I\r\nhave been rubbing and greasing the udder. The blind quarter is slightly\r\ninflamed.\r\n\r\nAn artificial opening should be made in the teat at once. Call in the\r\nnearest physician unless you have a regular graduate veterinarian near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCow Pox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a yearling heifer which is in fine condition and making good\r\ngrowth. But all four of her teats have sores on them and are mostly\r\ncovered with scabs.\r\n\r\nIt is probably cow pox. Give a physic of glauber and epsom salts mixed 4\r\nounces of each to the heifer and double the dose to the cow. Apply\r\nexternally, once daily, after washing, the following prescription: Zinc\r\nointment, 4 ounces; iodoform, 1/2 ounce; glycerine, 2 ounces; carbolic\r\nacid, 2 drachms. Mix thoroughly and apply. to sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause of \"Loss of Cud.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three months ago a pure-bred Jersey commenced to fail on her milk\r\nand soon went dry, although on good feed. Did not seem to be sick, but\r\ndid not eat ravenously as she generally did, and little was thought of\r\nit. During the past six weeks she has failed rapidly. Does not chew her\r\ncud, froths at the mouth, runs at the eyes, and when she eats anything\r\nmuch it bloats her. In fact, she seems bloated all the time. She is\r\nlifeless and will hardly move around, getting very thin, and hair\r\nstanding the wrong way. Is there such a thing as a cow losing her cud?\r\n\r\nMost people imagine a cow's cud is something material. As a matter of\r\nfact, in a certain sense the words appetite and cud are synonymous. You\r\ncan say a cow has lost her appetite or a cow has lost her cud. Now, any\r\nsickness severe enough will cause a cow to lose her appetite. The\r\nbloating is caused from indigestion secondary to some organic disease,\r\nprobably tuberculosis. Keep up the cow's strength by giving condensed\r\nfloods or drenches of egg-nogg, gruel or greens. Give warm salt-water\r\ninjections twice daily and give the following mixture: Quinine sulphate,\r\n2 ounces; Antipyrine, 1 ounce; ammonia muriate, 3 ounces; alcohol, 1\r\nquart; water 1 quart. Mix; give 2 ounces every four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalf Dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know the reason for bloody discharges from the bowels of\r\na young six-day-old calf. There is a looseness of the bowels and the\r\nblood is intermingled with the excrement. There is not a profuse amount\r\nof blood, nor is it very dark in color, and it seems to be accompanied\r\nwith mucus or light, thick substance.\r\n\r\nThis is dysentery, due to scours so prevalent in calves. Give 6 ounces\r\nolive oil, 4 drachms bismuth subnitrate and 1 drachm Pearson's creoline.\r\nThe discharge is very dangerous to other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBovine Rheumatism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Jersey cow got somewhat lame one year ago in one hip or leg after\r\ncalving but soon got better. Last June when she came in one leg was\r\nlame. It seems to be in the stiffle joint and the first one above. When\r\nshe walks she gets real lame.\r\n\r\nRheumatism is the trouble here. Give the following powder: Soda\r\nsalicylate, 3 ounces; salol, 2 ounces; pulv. gentian root, 2 ounces. Mix\r\nand make 24 powders. Give four daily. Apply Pratt's, a good veterinary\r\nliniment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBleeding for Blackleg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read several articles on blackleg, and it seems strange to me\r\nthat no mention is made of an operation that is an absolute preventive,\r\nnamely, bleeding in the feet.\r\n\r\nThe reason that no special mention of bleeding is made is that it is not\r\nnow considered the preventive that it once was. Some people appear to\r\nhave fair success with it, and others no success at all. The Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry states that the evidence indicates that bleeding,\r\nnerving, roweling or setoning have neither curative nor protective value\r\nand, therefore, should be discarded for vaccination which is now widely\r\nused as a preventive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Feeding, Depraved Appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have three cows. They have been fed alfalfa hay all winter and are in\r\nvery good condition and seem otherwise in good health, and have salt to\r\nrun to. Every time they chance to come to the yard they will pick up on\r\nold bone and chew it for perhaps a half hour. I always take the bone\r\naway from them when I discover it.\r\n\r\nThese cows have a depraved appetite, owing to the fact the tissues of\r\nthe body are crying out for something lacking that is required in the\r\nsystem. Administer the following powder; also put a lump of lime in the\r\nwatering trough: Pulv. gentian, 1 ounce; pulv. elm bark, 2 ounces; pulv.\r\niron sulphate, 1 ounce; pulv. bicarb. soda, 4 ounces; pulv. aniseed, 2\r\nounces; pulv. red pepper 1/2 ounce; pulv. oilcake meal 10 pounds. Mix\r\nthoroughly and give a tablespoonful in scalded grain once daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCows Swallowing Foreign Substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recently lost a valuable cow, and when we opened her we found a large\r\ntumor or abscess at the top of the heart as large as a gallon jar. What\r\ncaused it, or is there any danger of other cows taking it, and if so,\r\nwhat can we do?\r\n\r\nThis is a common disease among cows and is called traumatic\r\npericarditis. The trouble arises from the habit of the cows picking up\r\nforeign substances such as wire, nails, or hairpins, and swallowing\r\nthem. They are taken into the paunch and the digestive movements of this\r\norgan cause the foreign body to penetrate the lining and enter the\r\nheart, where it gradually causes death as it enters deeper. It is very\r\ncommon to find nails, etc., in the stomachs of old dairy cows which are\r\nkilled at the slaughter-houses. If you had examined the animal\r\ncarefully, you would find that some foreign body had penetrated the\r\nheart and caused death. There is no danger of any contagion arising from\r\nyour cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefective Urination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cow that seems to be in good health and gives plenty of milk.\r\nNearly every morning when she is being milked she seems to want to\r\nurinate and will stand letting the water drip from her.\r\n\r\nThis trouble often results from the cows eating alkaline hay. Give her\r\ntwo quarts of flaxseed tea daily. Mix it with her food in which there\r\nhas been placed one-half teaspoon of powdered Buchu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfectious Conjunctivitis (Sore Eyes).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have several cows and heifers that are affected with sore eyes. The\r\ndisease first makes its appearance by excessive watering of the eyes;\r\nthen the center or pupil becomes white and later turns red of bloodshot.\r\n\r\nBathe thoroughly with the normal salt solution (teaspoon salt to 1 pint\r\nwarm water), after which place in the eye and all around the mucuous\r\nmembrane of the eye the following: Twenty-five per cent solution of\r\nargyrol, one-half ounce; apply thoroughly once daily and keep out of the\r\nsunlight if possible. Another treatment is: Bathe the eyes once daily\r\nwith boracic acid 1 teaspoon, water 1 pint, after which thoroughly\r\nsaturate the eyelids and eyes with 1 to 10,000 solution of bichloride of\r\nmercury. You are dealing with a disease that will spread throughout your\r\nherd if you do not take proper means to separate the affected from the\r\nwell ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to Do Against Tuberculous Milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI should like to know what could be done with a dairy where cows are\r\ndying with tuberculosis and the owner knows, but is selling the milk.\r\n\r\nThe case should be reported to F. W. Andreason, Secretary of the State\r\nDairy Bureau, at San Francisco, for investigation by an inspector. If\r\nconditions are found as represented, the sale of milk will be prevented,\r\nas it is contrary to State law to sell milk from sick cows. County\r\nboards of health have also authority to prevent the sale of such milk in\r\nthe county on the ground that this is a menace to the public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Ill-Feeding Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a couple of pigs, out of about 75 head farrowed last spring,\r\nwhich seem to have the staggers. They are looking fairly well, feed well\r\non pasture and at feeding time are right there making as much noise as\r\nthe others. They run around as if they had a shot too much.\r\n\r\nYour pigs are suffering from acute indigestion, undoubtedly due to\r\nimproper feeding. Cut down the rations, especially if they are getting\r\ngrain. Give sick pigs two tablespoonfuls of castor oil each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSore Eyes in Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the matter with young pigs when their eyes swell shut? Before\r\nthey shut they look as if there was a white milky scum over them.\r\n\r\nThere is some infection present, and a good cleaning up in needed. The\r\nsows and pigs should be dipped in a warm solution of some coal-tar\r\ndisinfectant, and the quarters thoroughly cleaned and disinfected or\r\nchanged to a dry warm place. The pigs' eyes should be washed with warm\r\nwater and a few drops of the following solution dropped into eyes once a\r\nday for a few days: Have druggist prepare a 1 per cent solution of\r\nsilver nitrate. After applying this the eyes had better be washed a few\r\nminutes later with water to which a little common salt has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHog Cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a number of pigs which have been ailing for three weeks or so.\r\nThey discharge a yellowish kind of manure at times, running of the\r\nbowels. The most striking symptom seems to be a partial paralysis of the\r\nhindquarters. The hogs will be walking along and seem to lose control of\r\ntheir hing legs. It seems to be spreading to the other hogs and a number\r\nhave already died. Their appetite is poor.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly hog cholera. The owner should appeal to the\r\nExperiment Station at Berkeley for serum and treat all well hogs and\r\nclean up as thoroughly as possible. The matter should also be reported\r\nto the State Veterinarian at Sacramento.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPneumonia in Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the disease which may be said to confine itself, with few\r\nexceptions, to young pigs weighing 100 pounds or less? Its symptoms are\r\nat first sneezing and a mild cough. These quickly change to hard\r\ncoughing and labored breathing, which as the disease progresses shows\r\nevidence of much pain. The appetite is lost and the eyes become gummed\r\nand inflamed. In some cases the pig lingers on for weeks, while in\r\nothers death occurs almost immediately. Vomiting sometimes occurs.\r\n\r\nIt is pneumonia and in its treatment \"an ounce of prevention is worth a\r\npound of cure.\" Once pneumonia gets a foothold in a hog, the chances are\r\nso strongly in favor of death that recovery may be considered out of the\r\nquestion. Since remedies are not certain in the cure of pneumonia, it\r\nwill be found that the prevention of the disease is the only real way to\r\ncombat it. The main causes of the disease are exposure to draughts,\r\nsudden changes in temperature, damp beds, manure heaps as sleeping\r\nquarters, and exposure to the disease itself. Pigs in thin condition or\r\nweak constitutionally are more liable to contract the trouble than pigs\r\nin good flesh and healthy specimens. Good, dry, warm, comfortable\r\nsleeping houses, well ventilated and so arranged as to prevent crowding\r\nand piling up, will, I think, do more to prevent pneumonia than any\r\nother one thing. Some such preparation as advocated by the Government\r\nfor the prevention of hog cholera will help keep the stock in a good\r\nhealthy condition, the better to combat exposure. It is the little\r\nattentions that keep the herd healthy and in a vigorous condition, and\r\nby using simple preventatives, remedies will he found unnecessary. - H.\r\nB. Wintringham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Prescription for Hog Sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hogs seem to be mangy and scabby, but am unable to find any lice on\r\nthem. They eat well, but vomit a good deal and are falling off in flesh.\r\n\r\nThey may be affected with a chronic type of cholera, and this should be\r\ndetermined by some one who can see the hogs. Make a general cleaning up\r\nof the hogs and quarters, using a dip and repeating in ten days. Hogs\r\nhave a true mange as well as other animals. A change of feed may also be\r\nneeded, depending on what is being fed and how the hogs are managed.\r\nGreen alfalfa pasture with a moderate feed of shorts or middlings of\r\nwheat and ground barley made into a slop would be a good ration.\r\nEvidently there is some digestive trouble here, and a dose of croton oil\r\n(3 drops) mixed in a teaspoonful of raw linseed oil for each hog would\r\nbe beneficial. Charcoal, ashes, salt and a little epsom salts would be\r\nof benefit to tone the digestion. The oil should be carefully mixed in\r\nthe slop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPigs Out of Condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf a litter of pigs weaned about a month several of them have itchy\r\nscabs on their legs, ears and noses, and those having white feet show\r\nreddish spots through the hoofs. They did not get it until after they\r\nwere weaned. They are fed on soaked whole barley and have alfalfa\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nPut the pigs on a slop composed of wheat middlings and barley ground\r\nfine, with the hulls removed, and milk, or, in the absence of milk about\r\n8 or 10 per cent of meat meal to which add some good stock food. Dip\r\nthem with some standard brand of dip or apply crude oil to be sure that\r\nthey were free from lice, fleas, etc. Give them good, clean, comfortable\r\nsleeping quarters and trust to nature to do the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis of Sow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days one of my sows appears to be paralyzed in her\r\nhind quarters and now cannot use her hind legs at all. She is about a\r\nyear old and is due to farrow her first litter in and about six weeks.\r\n\r\nIt is paralysis due to advanced pregnancy. Give 4 ounces castor oil and\r\n4 ounces olive oil. She will recover after parturition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRickets in Hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA fine boar, 16 months old, weight about 380 pounds, well built, with\r\nlittle surplus fat, until lately has been very thrifty, but appears to\r\nbe losing control over his legs. Can't step over the smallest stick\r\nwithout falling forward and acts like a foundered animal. He carries his\r\nback rather arching since this trouble came on. During my absence from\r\nhome a hired man gave this boar a good beating with a pick handle, and\r\nit appears to have been the beginning of his troubles.\r\n\r\nThis disease is Osteo Rachitis (rickets). The abuse has probably\r\naggravated the symptoms: This condition is due to a lack of hardening\r\nprinciples in the bones. Give 4 ounces of cod liver oil daily and plenty\r\nof lime water to drink. It will be all right to use him for breeding\r\nwhen he recovers. In addition to good food and pure water give daily a\r\nhandful of a mixture of principally ashes and burned barley (charcoal)\r\nwith the usual addition of salt, sulphur and soda. This mixture is good:\r\nPulv. dried, iron sulphate, 4 ounces; soda bi-carbonate, 8 ounces; soda\r\nsalicylate, 2 drachms; pulv. aniseed, 4 ounces. Mix and give one-half\r\nteaspoonful twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPigs Losing Tails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have five pigs, 17 days old, and when they were farrowed they had\r\nrings around the roots of their tails, and now their tails are dropping\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by interference with circulation before birth. Apply\r\ntinct. iodine around the affected parts once daily and if it shows no\r\nsigns of improvement after one week amputate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver-Fat Sow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brood sow is awfully fat; how should I feed her so that she don't get\r\ntoo fat? She is bred and it will be her third litter. She was running in\r\nthe vineyard all winter, and I fed her a handful of barley every day or\r\na few potatoes. Now she has free access to my growing barley field, and\r\nI give her half a dozen potatoes every day.\r\n\r\nYou need not worry about getting her thin. She simply requires less\r\nfood. An animal excessively fat brings forth an inferior offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusty Corn for Pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould Egyptian corn that has been musty and then dried in the sun be fit\r\nfor pigs? It heated and musted quite a good deal, but is dried well. The\r\nidea is, to grind it and then feed it in milk if good.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous to feed any stock moldy or musty food, especially\r\npregnant animals. It is this kind of food which causes a majority of the\r\nabortions. Mold or smut in food is poisonous both to man and beast. It\r\nis usually almost impossible to get out of feed because it runs\r\nthroughout the structure of the hay or grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds and Wound Swellings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper treatment for a fresh wire cut on a horse? How should\r\nsaddle galls be treated? Is there any way to make the hair come in its\r\nnatural color where saddle galls have been? How can an enlargement of a\r\ncolt's leg, caused from a wire cut, be reduced?\r\n\r\nAfter all foreign matter has been removed from a lacerated wound, like\r\nthat made in a wire cut, the wound should be carefully fomented with\r\nwarm water, to which has been added carbolic acid in the proportion of 1\r\npart to 100 of water. It should then be bandaged to prevent infection.\r\nZinc ointment would be a good thing to use under the bandage. For a\r\nsimple saddle, or harness gall, some ointment like the following should\r\nbe applied and the wound rested up: One pint alcohol in which are shaken\r\nthe whites of 2 eggs; a solution of nitrate of silver, 10 grains to the\r\nounce of water; sugar of lead or sulphate of zinc, 20 grains to an ounce\r\nof water; and so on. Or advertised gall cures may be applied. If a\r\nsitfest has developed, the dead hornlike slough must be cut out and the\r\nwound treated with antiseptics. There is no way we know of to make hair\r\ncome in with natural color after a wound. The swelling on the colt's leg\r\nmay he reduced by rubbing it well several times a day and at night rub\r\nin some 10 per cent iodine petrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFly Repellants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what to use as a spray to kill the flies in my stable?\r\nIn the early, morning the ceiling and sides are thickly covered with the\r\npests partly dormant but not enough so that they can be swept down and\r\nkilled. What spray can I use that will destroy them?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to kill flies by spraying them. You can, however, spray\r\nthe sides and ceiling of the barn with a spray of epsom salts (sulphate\r\nof magnesia) using about a cupful to the gallon, which will prevent them\r\nfrom gathering there. And since prevention is better than cure, flies\r\ncan be kept from gathering around by, destroying their breeding places,\r\nif those are under one's control, by having all manure and litter\r\nremoved before the flies have a chance to develop. The following may be\r\nfound useful to readers as a spray to keep away flies: Fish oil, 2\r\nquarts; kerosene, 1 quart; crude carbolic acid, 1 pint; oil of\r\npennyroyal, 1 ounce; oil of tar; 10 ounces. Mix thoroughly and apply in\r\na fine spray. The following has been successfully used to repel flies\r\nfrom cows: Nitro benzine, 5 ounces; carbolic acid, 3 ounces; kerosene\r\noil, 3 ounces; sol. formaldehyde, 1 ounce; fish oil, 1 1/2 quarts. Mix\r\nand just touch the hair with the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Destroy Fleas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy barn, is full, of fleas I tried to destroy them by using creso-dip,\r\nbut did not kill them, all.\r\n\r\nFleas can only be permanently checked by destroying their breeding\r\nplaces which are in the dust! and dirt that accumulate in cracks and\r\ncorners around barns, sheds and dwellings. Follow the cleaning up with a\r\nthorough distribution of flake naphthalene. This is most effective where\r\nthe stable or room can be closed tight for half a day, or even 24 hours;\r\nAn ingenious suggestion is made that if a sheep can be let run in and\r\naround the buildings where the fleas breed, they will soon be less\r\nnumerous and as new batches hatch out the sheep will soon get them\r\npicked up, and after a while the place will be entirely free of them.\r\nBut the sheep must be allowed to run all around the sheds and breeding\r\nplaces, as the flea jumps up, gets into the wool, and can never get out\r\nagain. A hog can also be used as a flea trap. One reader says: Pour a\r\nlittle of the crude oil on the hogs' heads and along their backs, about\r\na gill on each hog; This would run down the sides of the hogs and kill\r\nall the fleas on them. The oil also remains on the hogs for several\r\ndays, and all the fleas that jump on the hogs from the ground stick fast\r\nand never jump off again. In about three weeks the fleas all disappear\r\nand the hogs look fine and sleek from the use of the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart VIII. Poultry Keeping\r\n\r\nLargely compiled from the writings of Mrs. W. Russell James and Mrs.\r\nSusan Swapgood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeaching Chicks to Perch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a good method of breaking in young brooder chicks to use the\r\nroosts?\r\n\r\nAt from six to eight weeks old the chicks should be taken from the\r\nbrooder quarters to the colony houses and range, or wherever they are to\r\nbe located, and at this time they should be taught to perch. Have the\r\nnew quarters arranged with low wide perches (1 by 3-inch scantlings);\r\nalso make slatted frames by nailing lath or other such narrow strips two\r\ninches apart. Set these frames against the wall so that they will extend\r\nslant-wise under the perches, and have the corners on the other side of\r\nthe room cut off by nailing boards across them. The chicks will run up\r\non the frame to find a huddling corner and land on the perches, as they\r\ncannot rest on the open slanting frame. A little care for a few evenings\r\nin putting up those that remain on the floor and straightening them out\r\non the perches will teach them the ropes. Where there are but a few to\r\nbe taught, all that is necessary is to provide the low wide perches and\r\nshut out the corners, and a few of the smart ones will soon take to the\r\nperches, and gradually others will follow until all will be roosting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiver Disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hens which seem well in every respect up to the time of their\r\ncombs changing color, when they die within three days. The combs turn a\r\nfaint yellow, almost white; they are heavy, have their usual appetite up\r\nto the lost 24 hours. I have treated by giving small doses of castor oil\r\nand Douglas mixture in the drinking water, feeding on dry mash with\r\nplenty of green feed. There is no tendency to lameness nor limp neck.\r\nThe droppings are loose and very white.\r\n\r\nThe fowls were victims of jaundice, which is a form of liver disease and\r\ncaused by over-feeding on rich starchy foods that also cause fowls to\r\nbecome overfat. However, at the end of the laying season and the\r\nbeginning of the molt the poultry keeper will lose some hens, even when\r\nkept under the best conditions, and especially hens of that age. In\r\ndoctoring such cases in the way described, if the fowl does not improve\r\nin a couple of days, the hatchet cure is the most profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRupture of Oviduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had two other hens die suddenly when on the nest. The second one\r\n- we opened and found one egg broken near the vent and another with\r\nshell formed ready to be laid.\r\n\r\nRupture of the oviduct was probably the cause of the hens dying on the\r\nnest and is due to the same condition in the hens; that is, the\r\nstraining to expel the egg necessary in the engorged condition of the\r\ninternal organs from overfatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelons for Fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave \"stock melons\" or \"citrons\" any merit as a green food for laying\r\nhens? Are the seeds of the above injurious to hens or cows?\r\n\r\nStock melons are desirable for chicken feeding if other succulent\r\nmaterials are scarce, but they are inferior to alfalfa and other\r\nclovers. Seeds are not injurious to stock unless possibly one should\r\nfeed to excess by separating them from the other tissues. If melons are\r\nfed as they grow, no apprehension need be had from injury by seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRape and Vetch for Chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat time do you sow rape and vetch and are they good for chickens?\r\n\r\nThey surely are good for chickens or for any other stock that likes\r\ngreens. They are winter growers in California valleys and should be sown\r\nin the fall as soon as the land is moist enough to keep them growing, or\r\njust as soon as you can get it moist either by rainfall or irrigation.\r\nNeither plant likes dry heat or dry soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreserving Eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a good way to preserve eggs for home use?\r\n\r\nIn a cool cellar, eggs will keep very well in a mixture of common salt\r\nand bran. Use equal parts, mix well, and as you gather the eggs from day\r\nto day pack with big end down in the mixture and see that the eggs are\r\ncovered. Waterglass eggs are good enough for cooking purposes, but when\r\nboiled anyone that knows the taste of a strictly fresh egg can tell the\r\ndifference in an instant; when fried the taste is not so pronounced, but\r\nit is there just the same; besides, when broken, they are a little\r\nwatery. This watery condition passes off if left to stand for a few\r\nminutes. The best way is to use the waterglass method, is one quart of\r\nwaterglass to ten quarts of water. Boil the water and put away to cool,\r\nwhen cold add the waterglass, mixing well, and store in 3 or 5-gallon\r\ncrocks in a cool place. They will keep six months if good when put in.\r\nIn all cases the eggs must be gathered very fresh, for one stale egg\r\nwill spoil the whole lot, so great care is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDipping Fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you dip hens to kill lice?\r\n\r\nTo dip fowls you must have a very warm day, or a warm room where you can\r\nturn them in to dry. I have know people to use tobacco stems, but it\r\nrequires good judgment as to the right strength to use. The dips usually\r\nsold already prepared are safer, in my opinion, because they give\r\ndirections as to quantity. Get a can of \"zenoleum\" or \"creolium\" -\r\neither is good - and have the water a little over blood-heat to\r\ncommence; be very careful that the liquid does not get in the fowl's\r\nthroat. If there are no directions with the cans, put enough in to make\r\nthe water quite milky and strong smelling. It is best to make the hen\r\nsit down and with a sponge wet the back and head thoroughly, then under\r\nthe wings and breast; if there are nits, don't be in a hurry to take\r\nthe hen out, but let the dip get to the nits and skin on the abdomen. If\r\nthe water is too warm it will be dangerous, as some fowls have weak\r\nhearts; that is the only danger, providing you dry them quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCure for Feather-Eating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the cure for feather-eating?\r\n\r\nFeather eating is the result of idleness or a shortage of green feed.\r\nThe best way to cure it is to furnish the fowls with exercise. Boil some\r\noats until soft, and when cooked stir in salt enough to taste and about\r\na quart of good beef scrap; feed this for breakfast several mornings\r\ntogether. Make them scratch for the rest of their food in deep litter\r\nand give them sour milk to drink if you have it. If sour milk is not\r\navailable, put a tablespoonful of flowers of sulphur in the boiled oats.\r\nThe object is to cool the blood and furnish exercise. See that the fowls\r\nare supplied with mineral matter, such ash shells, bone meal and some,\r\nsand if it can be had. It is surprising the amount of sand that chickens\r\nwill eat when carried to them in yards, so there must be a necessity for\r\nit, and if they cannot get to it, it pays to carry a good box full once\r\nin a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCannibal Chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to cure my chicks of eating each other?\r\n\r\nSome kind of animal food is necessary when the chicks begin to pick\r\ntoes, wings and vents. But the meat must always be cooked, the least bit\r\nof raw meat drives them wild as does the blood they can bring on each\r\nother. For that reason a strict watch must be kept to detect any case\r\nbefore blood is brought. Remove all weak chicks as they always go for\r\nthe weakest, and as soon as one chick is picked on for a victim, remove\r\nit at once. Some people paint the toes with tar or liquid lice paint,\r\nbut I have had the best success with bitter aloes mixed with water. A\r\nnickel's worth covers a lot of toes. It is best to buy a powder, then\r\ndissolve in a little water and paint wings, vent and toes. They won't\r\ntake many pecks at them when they find they are so bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunflower Seeds for Poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the food value of sunflower seed as a ration for fowls, mostly\r\nlaying hens? Should it be fed whole or crushed?\r\n\r\nSunflower seed is rich in oil, having the same proportion as flaxseed;\r\notherwise it rates in value the same as grain. A little, not too much,\r\nfed whole is well relished by fowls and is said to give luster to the\r\nplumage in fitting birds for shows. Sunflower is greatly overrated for\r\npoultry purposes. It is an ungainly plant of no use for forage and its\r\nseed is so well liked by the sparrows that the only way to keep them\r\ntill ripe is to cover the heads with netting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClipping Hens for Cleanliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hens foul all the feathers below the vent; they appear healthy, but\r\ndo not look nice. What can I do?\r\n\r\nTake a pair of scissors and clip the fluff away from that part of the\r\nabdomen, give a teaspoonful of olive oil, and notice of they have any\r\ndischarge that is of an offensive color or odor. Sometimes it is nothing\r\nbut pure laziness with hens of the large breeds that causes this matting\r\ntogether of the fluff below the vent. We rarely see hens of the small\r\nbreeds so affected. Whenever a hen soils her feathers clip her at once,\r\nand, in fact, it is a good custom to follow in any case. When hens are\r\nvery heavily fluffed it interferes with the fertility of the eggs. In\r\nsuch cases there is not anything for it but the scissors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBowel Trouble in Chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of bowel trouble in young chicks, and what to do for\r\nit?\r\n\r\nBowel trouble in very young chicks is usually caused by a chill. It is\r\nvery hard for us here to believe chicks get chilled because, not feeling\r\nthe cold ourselves, we forget that chicks have really undergone a\r\nviolent change from incubator to the outside atmosphere. In the Eastern\r\nStates, great care is exercised in moving chicks from incubator to\r\nbrooder oven, and also in seeing that the brooder itself is warm and fit\r\nto receive the chicks. But we are, as a rule, very careless in these\r\nlittle matters and the chicks feel the change and suffer from bowel\r\ntrouble. Sometimes, of course, the trouble may be traced to the food,\r\nbut more often it comes from a chill. The best way to cure it is to\r\nremove the chicks to new ground at once, or if in a brooder, clean it\r\nout well and spray with some disinfectant. Boil all the water that is\r\ngiven to the chicks and feed boiled rice once or twice a day in which a\r\nlittle cinnamon is mixed. Do not put in too much or they will not eat\r\nit, keep all meat away and just feed dry chick feed and boiled rice. No\r\noatmeal or any other cereal but the rice; if chicks won't eat it, feed\r\ndry chick feed and boiled water and a little lettuce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Roosters and Laying Hens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I get the young roosters off quick and the hens to lay in\r\nwinter?\r\n\r\nThese two happy results come from correct methods of poultry keeping\r\nfrom the ground up. To get the cockerels off quick, they must be hatched\r\nfrom strong-germed eggs, incubated properly and kept growing from the\r\nfirst jump out of the shell. To get eggs in winter the pullets must come\r\nfrom the same conditions. Very few hens will lay in the early winter\r\nunder any conditions. The pullets must be depended upon for that season\r\nand the hens kept properly will drop in some time in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry Tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a good poultry tonic?\r\n\r\nThe following is a very good tonic for general purposes: Tincture of red\r\ncinchona, 1 fluid ounce; tincture of chloride of iron, 1 fluid drachm;\r\ntincture of flux vomica, 4 fluid drachms; glycerine 2 ounces; water, 2\r\nounces. Mix and give one teaspoonful to a quart of water, allowing no\r\nother drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry in the Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly advise me about keeping hens in an orchard. I would like to know\r\nif they will injure the trees in any way if kept in large numbers. In\r\nwhat way would they benefit the trees?\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the trees there is no doubt that they would be\r\nadvantaged by the presence of the poultry, providing the coops are not\r\nallowed to interfere with the proper irrigation and cultivation. If it\r\nis practicable to handle the fowls in coops without causing the soil\r\naround the coops to become compacted by continual tramping, and if they\r\nare not kept upon the ground long enough to cause an excessive\r\napplication of hen manure, which is very concentrated and stimulating,\r\nthe result would unquestionably be beneficial. From the point of view of\r\nthe tree, this benefit of injury would depend upon how long the fowls\r\nwere kept around the tree and the maintenance of them in such a way that\r\nthe soil should not become out of condition physically or too rich\r\nchemically for the satisfactory performance of the tree. If they can be\r\nmoved frequently, and if they are only put in place when the soil is in\r\nsuch condition that tramping around the coops will not seriously compact\r\nit, the presence of fowls would be an advantage. On the other hand, if\r\nthe coops are to be kept in place for a long time and all the ground\r\noutside of them crusted and hardened by tramping and the soil under the\r\ncoops overloaded with droppings, the thrift and value of the trees will\r\nbe seriously interfered with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaponizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan three to four month old cockerels be caponized successfully in\r\nsummer, and if so, what care, feed, etc., do they require afterwards?\r\n\r\nThe birds should be between two to three months, not over four, unless\r\nsome very large variety that matures slowly. Size is equally important\r\nas age, and a bird to be caponized should not weigh more than one and a\r\nhalf pounds. The work can be successfully done in the summer season, but\r\nthe fowl must be kept without food or drink for at least 24 hours,\r\nlonger is better and keep in shady place. After caponizing, feed the\r\nbird what soft feed he will eat up and let him have plenty of water.\r\nThen leave him to himself as he will be his own doctor. In two or three\r\ndays look them over and if there are any wind-balls, simply prick with a\r\nneedle to let the air out; this may have to be done two or three times\r\nbefore the wound heals up, but after it has healed, treat just as you\r\nwould other chickens and feed them about twice a day. There is nothing\r\nmade by trying to rush nature; it takes fifteen months to grow a good\r\ncapon of the large breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoup Treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to a week ago the chickens had been exceptionally well in every way.\r\nNow they seem to have a cold and a running at the nose and with it a bad\r\nodor. It was suggested that this might be the beginning of roup, but I\r\nsee no swell-head.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of roup is not so-called \"swell head\"\r\nor other form of cold, but the offensive roupy odor. When the cold has\r\nreached this stage it is a pronounced case of roup, and highly\r\ncontagious. Separate all the ailing fowls and segregate them in\r\ncomfortable hospital quarters, warm but with one side partly open for\r\nfresh air. Disinfect the quarters of the well fowls by spraying with\r\ndistillate or cheap-grade coal oil and sprinkling the floors and about\r\nthe houses with air-slaked lime. Use some simple remedy like coal oil or\r\npermanganate of potash to cleanse the throat and nostrils. With coal\r\noil, first wipe the eyes and bill with a clean cloth dipped in the coal\r\noil, then inject with a sewing-machine oil can enough coal oil to\r\nopen and thoroughly clean out the nostrils. If the throat is affected,\r\ngive a tablespoonful of sweet oil and coal oil, half and half, two or\r\nthree times a day until relieved. One of our correspondents has sent us\r\nthe following treatment with permanganate of potash which he has found\r\nthe best roup remedy he has ever tried: Dissolve 1 ounce of permanganate\r\nof potash in 3 pints of water, hold the fowl's head in this for a\r\nsecond, then open the beak and rinse out the mouth in the solution. Wipe\r\nwith a clean, soft cloth and apply a very little witch hazel or\r\ncarbolated salve to the eyes, nostrils and head. Repeat the operation as\r\noften as the throat and head become clogged with mucus. Until the\r\ndisease is eliminated from the premises, keep permanganate of potash in\r\nthe drinking water of all the fowls, both sick and well. About 1 ounce\r\nto each 2 gallons of water or enough to give the water a claret color.\r\nThe sick fowls should be allowed no other feed but a little stimulating\r\nmash three times a day. Where the fowls do not show a decided\r\nimprovement in the course of a few days, or where the disease has\r\nassumed a violent form, all such birds should be killed and the bodies\r\nburned at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBad Food for Chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy chicks are about three weeks old and have always been strong and\r\nsturdy, but when taken sick first appear a little dumpish, then the head\r\nseems a little heavy and the neck lengthens out. As the disease advances\r\nthey become staggery.\r\n\r\nYour chicks have eaten soured food, decayed vegetables or tainted meat.\r\nBaby chicks are just like other babies and the same care should be used\r\nthat their food be always sweet and fresh. Wet food should never be\r\ngiven chicks, nor raw meat nor anything the least bit tainted or stale.\r\nPut a teaspoon of coal oil in each pint of drinking water and see to it\r\nthat the latter is kept pure and cool. Mix a teacup of sulphur with\r\nenough bran or shorts for each 100 chicks, moisten with sweet milk and\r\nfeed it on clean boards, what the chicks will eat up clean in some,\r\ntwenty minutes. Give them one feed of this each day for three days if\r\nthe weather is dry. Clean the brooders and runs daily, then dust white\r\nwith air-slacked lime and cover the lime with a sprinkling of clean\r\nsand. Rake and clean up the yards where they range and never let them\r\neat any of their grain or food out of dirt and filth. You cannot doctor\r\nsuch small chicks and must depend upon the coal oil in the drinking\r\nwater. Keep the water fresh, but add the coal oil until the chicks are\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen-Front Chicken Houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what direction shall I face open-front poultry houses?\r\n\r\nNorth or northeast is the proper direction to face the open fronts of\r\npoultry houses and coops in the Pacific Coast climate. The prevailing\r\nwinds are from the south and southeast in the winter, and from the west\r\nand southwest in the summer. The occasional north winds or \"northers,\"\r\nmay be called dry winds, in fact, are an indication of dry weather, and\r\nso do not harm the fowls even when cold. We like the upper half of the\r\nnorth-end or slide of our poultry houses open with inch-mesh covering\r\nthe open space and the eaves extending several inches as a protection.\r\nIn case of an unusual storm from that direction, one thickness of burlap\r\nmay be tacked to the edge of the extending eaves, and to the lower part\r\nof the opening. This will admit plenty of fresh air while breaking the\r\nforce of the wind. We also have a large trap door for the use of the\r\nfowls, in the solid lower part of the open end, and the large door, for\r\ncleaning and sunning the house, in the west side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Point on Mating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have fine roosters a year old this April; would you advise keeping\r\nthem for mating with the same hens next season, or do you advise selling\r\neach year and getting fresh stock?\r\n\r\nThe young males will be all right to mate with the same hens next season\r\n- that is, if they come through the molt with vigor. They will be just\r\ntwo years old and at their best. The molt is the test for both, hens and\r\ncocks. If they show no signs of ailing or weakness during that period,\r\nit is proof of the proper stamina and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAge for Mating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what age may a cockerel be mated with hens?\r\n\r\nFrom nine months to a year is the proper age to mate a Leghorn cockerel.\r\nCockerels of the larger breeds should not be mated before a year old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite-Yolk Eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are eggs watery and light-colored?\r\n\r\nThe trouble is in the feed somewhere. Too much green feed, especially\r\ngreen feed that springs from wet, soggy ground, will sometimes make the\r\neggs watery. Or if you are feeding more mash feed than dry grain, it\r\nwill have that tendency. Some people claim that the feed a hen eats does\r\nnot affect the egg at all; but if it does not, why do eggs differ in\r\ncolor and quality? Eggs that are laid by hens fed wholly on wheat, or\r\nthe by-products of wheat, such as bran, shorts or middlings, all have a\r\npale yolk. Now feed the hens some green feed - any kind will do - and\r\nthe eggs from the same hens will have a yolk several degrees or shades\r\ndarker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry Diarrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you kindly tell me the cause and cure for bowel trouble among hens?\r\n\r\nThe \"quick cure\" for chick diarrhea has not yet been found. Prevention\r\nis the only sure remedy. The first treatment in diarrhea (which must not\r\nbe confused with simple looseness of the bowels) should be a mild physic\r\nto clean out the digestive tract. Epsom salts is probably best for this\r\npurpose where a number of fowls are to be treated. This is usually given\r\nin the drinking water, but Dr. Morse, who has charge of the\r\ninvestigation of poultry diseases in the Bureau of Animal Industry,\r\ngives the following directions for administering the salts: \"Clean out\r\nby giving epsom salts in an evening mash, estimating one-third to\r\none-half teaspoonful to each adult bird, or a teaspoonful to each six\r\nhalf-grown chicks, carefully proportioning the amount of mash to the\r\nappetite of the birds, so that the whole will be eaten up quickly.\" For\r\na few days afterward, feed only lightly with dry grain and tender\r\ngreens, such as fresh-cut mustard and lettuce leaves. Keep plenty of\r\npure, cool water, with just a thin skim of coal oil - one drop to each\r\npint - for drinking; also plenty of sharp grit and fresh charcoal broken\r\nto the size of grains of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimber-Neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA very peculiar disease is taking off my fowls. The head of the fowl\r\nbends down to the breast and the fowl looks like dead, there is also a\r\nslight discharge from the mouth. The head and tail droop and if the fowl\r\ncould stand up they would almost touch.\r\n\r\nWhen a fowl loses partial or entire control of the muscles of the neck\r\nthe common name of the affection is limber-neck. In medical science\r\nlimber-neck is regarded as a symptom rather than a disease, and may be\r\ndue to a number of causes, such as derangement of the digestive organs,\r\nintestinal worms and ptomaine poisoning. The affected fowls should be\r\ngiven immediately a full tablespoon of fresh melted lard or sweet oil,\r\nto which has been added a scant teaspoonful, of coal oil. In an hour\r\nrepeat the dose. For a few days the fowls should be fed on some light\r\nfood, such as shorts scalded with sweet milk in which has been dissolved\r\na level teaspoonful of baking soda to every pint of milk, and also\r\nallowed plenty of crisp, tender lettuce or similar greens. A little\r\nEpsom salts should be added to the drinking water for a few days. This\r\ntreatment, if resorted to at the start, will be effectual, but if the\r\npoisoning has had its course long, nothing will save the bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken Pox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy one and two-year-old fowls are getting scabby combs. It starts with a\r\nround blackish spot and swells into many spots, finally nearly covering\r\none side of the comb. Sometimes accompanying this is the closing of one\r\neye, and later both eyes.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is chicken pox, which is a very contagious disease. A\r\ntreatment which has been successful consists in bathing the sores with\r\nstrong salt and water and giving the fowls a mash containing one\r\nteaspoonful of calcium sulphide for each 25 hens. With a large flock of\r\nhens the method successfully employed by one of the large coast ranches\r\nin stamping out an epidemic of the disease was to place a sulphur\r\nsmudge, to which had been added a little carbolic acid, in the poultry\r\nhouse after the fowls had gone to roost. This was allowed to remain till\r\nthe fowls began to sneeze, when it was instantly removed. The affected\r\nfowls were also treated by dipping the heads in a solution of\r\npermanganate of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoup in Turkeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy turkeys have a disease that is spreading rapidly. They commence with\r\na running at the nose, have swelling under the eyes which are filled\r\nwith pus.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a case of cold developing into roup. Get one ounce of\r\npermanganate of potash and pour a quart of boiling water over; after it\r\nis cold, bottle for use. Now take an old tin can, three parts full of\r\nwarm, not hot water, and drop in enough of the permanganate of potash to\r\nmake it dark red. Hold the turk's head under in this can until it needs\r\nbreath then give it time to breathe, and dip again. Press the fingers\r\nalong the swollen parts towards the nostrils and get out all the pus you\r\ncan, then take a sewing-machine oil can and fill it with a little of the\r\nmixture, and part olive oil, inject the liquid up the nostrils and in\r\nthe cleft of the mouth. Put a little of the permanganate in the drinking\r\nwater for all the flock. Make the water a light red, later it will turn\r\nto a dirty brown, but don't mind that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisinfectants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I use to disinfect poultry belongings?\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid spray is good, but you will need to be very careful that\r\nyou do not get it on the hands or clothing. Get 16 ounces sulphuric acid\r\n(50 per cent solution), water 6 gallons. Have the water in a wooden tub\r\nor barrel and add the sulphuric acid to the water very slowly, in order\r\nnot to splash it on the flesh or clothes. But mind: nothing but wooden\r\nvessels to mix it in. When made according to directions, and of this\r\nstrength it is a very valuable disinfectant, but is dangerous to use of\r\nany stronger mixing. After mixing, it can be stored in glass bottles or\r\nearthenware jugs. Another very good disinfectant for poultry houses and\r\nruns is the formaldehyde disinfectant. Formaldehyde 1 pint (40 per\r\ncent), water 2 gallons. This is fine for houses that you can shut up.\r\nTurn the fowls out of the building, close all windows, and spray\r\nthoroughly, then close the door and leave it do the work. Air well by\r\nopening windows and door several hours before the fowls go to roost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloth for Brooding Houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould some good grade of white cloth on a frame do as well, or would it\r\nbe better than glass, for a brooder house, or would it keep out too much\r\nsun-heat?\r\n\r\nCheesecloth, not heavy cloth, would be better than glass, so far as the\r\nsun is concerned. There would be none of the overheating during the\r\nmiddle of the day followed by the chilling at night which are caused by\r\na large expanse of glass. On the other hand, there should not be\r\nopenings on opposite sides of the house to create a draft. Also, the rat\r\nand vermin question must be considered. It might be necessary to have\r\nwire screens made to fit firmly over the cloth at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrains for Chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat variety of grain adopted for poultry food will be the best to grow,\r\nwith and also without irrigation?\r\n\r\nWheat is a standard grain for poultry feeding, and Egyptian corn is also\r\nlargely used. Indian corn is also satisfactory, under the general roles\r\nfor compounding poultry rations which are laid down by all authorities\r\non the subject. Egyptian corn is very successful in the interior parts\r\nof the State, and, on lands which are winter-plowed and harrow to retain\r\nmoisture, very satisfactory results can be secured by summer growth\r\nwithout irrigation from planting as soon as frost danger is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlucking Ducks and Geese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know about how, when and how often to pick old ducks so\r\nas to get the feathers for pillows and not kill the ducks, either. Will\r\nthey lay any eggs while growing new feathers?\r\n\r\nNeither ducks nor geese should be plucked until after the laying season\r\nis over, which will be in July. Just before the moult, when the feathers\r\nbegin to loosen, they may be plucked again. Those most considerate of\r\ntheir birds make only this latter plucking, which does not greatly\r\ninconvenience the fowls. At no time must they be plucked unless the\r\nfeathers are \"ripe\"; that is, dry at the root, so that no bleeding or\r\ninjury to the skin is caused. An old stocking is drawn over the head of\r\nthe victim, and the bird held in the plucker's lap on a burlap apron;\r\nthen the soft feathers on the body are quickly and very gently removed;\r\nbut those on the side of the body which support the wings should not be\r\ntaken. Great care should be exercised not to injure the skin or\r\npinfeathers or pull the down. To grow new feathers quickly and resume\r\nlaying are matters which depend largely upon the condition of the bird\r\nand the feed. The latter should consist of some 15 per cent of animal\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Hens for Hatching Eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould soft feed be given to the mothers of chicks intended for\r\nbroilers? How about dry mash? How would you advise feeding animal\r\nprotein?\r\n\r\nCut out all ground feed, except perhaps a little wheat bran. While you\r\nmay not get quite as many eggs, they will all have good strong germs and\r\nthe chicks will stand forcing to the limit, while if you force the egg\r\noutput you reduce the vitality of the germs and livability of chicks\r\nhatched. The only way to feed hens whose eggs are intended for hatching\r\nchicks for broilers is to feed whole grain and make them exercise for\r\nit, good green feed, or, better still, sprouted oats, and feed beef\r\nscrap in a hopper all the time. At first, while it is new, they may eat\r\nmore than you would give them but don't mind that they will regulate the\r\nquantity in a few days better than you can. Get a good grade of beef\r\nscrap and keep it in a hopper that will not let rain in or keep it under\r\ncover and feed all the wheat and oats they require; if you are short on\r\ngreen feed give them a bale of alfalfa hay to work on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dry Mash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you give a formula for a dry mash?\r\n\r\nWheat bran, 500 pounds; middlings, 200 pounds; cracked corn, 200 pounds;\r\ncharcoal, 20 pounds; alfalfa meal 200 pounds; bone meal, 150 pounds;\r\nblood-meal 100 pounds; meat cracklings, if ground, 200 pounds; ground\r\noats or barley, 300 pounds. Give oyster shell separately and supply\r\nfowls with good sharp grit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepluming Mites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy chickens are losing the feathers from their necks, some three inches\r\ndown the front and then extending around the neck.\r\n\r\nThe loss of feathers is probably due to the depluming mite. Dust well\r\nwith buhach through the feathered portion of the bird and apply\r\ncarbolated vaseline to the bare skin and the edges of the feathers where\r\nthe insects work. Do this daily as long as needed. When vaseline is not\r\non hand, a mixture of coal oil and sweet oil applied with a soft sponge\r\nsqueezed nearly dry does as well. We would advise that you make a\r\ngeneral cleaning and spraying of your poultry quarters, nest boxes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IX. Pests and Diseases of Plants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl of Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis county is having trouble with the grasshoppers as are other\r\ncounties. Would you kindly inform me what I could do to exterminate them\r\non my young orchard?\r\n\r\nThe best thing for grasshoppers is to fix up a lot of poison. This is\r\nmade in the proportion of 40 pounds of bran, 2 pounds of molasses and 5\r\nof arsenic, mixed together as a mash. They will take this wherever they\r\nfind it, even when nice green leaves are close by, but it has to be kept\r\nmoist. Grasshoppers can also be reduced by driving a \"hopper doser\" over\r\nground where they are. This is made somewhat like a Fresno scraper, but\r\nis much longer and the bottom is covered with crude oil. When disturbed\r\nthe hoppers jump up and fall into the oil. Besides the poison, you\r\nshould also protect the trunk of the tree to prevent the hoppers from\r\nclimbing up it. This can be done by applying tree tanglefoot, or putting\r\non one of the tree guards that prevent climbing insects from passing up\r\nto the leaves. The combination of poison and tree guards will give you\r\nabout all the protection you need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunburn and Borers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease state the best remedy for keeping the borer out of young fruit\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nSunburn can be prevented in many ways. The manufactured tree-protectors\r\nare good if they are light colored and are kept in place so that the sun\r\ndoes not scald above or below them. Wrapping spirally with narrow strips\r\nof burlap, torn from old grain sacks, from the base to the forking of\r\nthe branches, is also good. A very effective and widely used method is\r\nto apply a good durable whitewash which may be made of 30 pounds of\r\nlime, 4 pounds of tallow and 5 pounds of salt, adding the salt to the\r\nwater used in slaking the lime, stirring in the tallow while the slaking\r\nis in progress and hot, and then adding water to thin the wash so that\r\nit will work well with pump or brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGumming of Prune Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI write to ask for information concerning my prune trees. They are from\r\ntwo to six years old and the gum is exuding from them. As I notice the\r\nbranches dying I cut them out, but this doesn't seem to save the tree. I\r\nwould appreciate any information you can give me.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty hard matter to diagnose from a distance. There is a\r\ngood probability that the trouble is caused by sunburn, a point you\r\ncould determine on inspection. Whitewash would be a protection against\r\nthis and more or less of a cure also. Furthermore, borers may be the\r\ncause, which can be determined by examining the points where the gum\r\nexudes, seeing if any wood grains are present. These borers should be\r\ndug out and whitewash applied, which latter also protects against this\r\ntrouble. Lastly, your ground may be drying out, which also you can\r\ndetermine and remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorers in Olive Twigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of olive trees in this locality that have\r\nsomething wrong with them. They make a growth of five or six inches and\r\nthe center twig dies back, then it sprouts out at the sides and makes\r\nanother growth in the same way. This makes a thick bush instead of the\r\ntree coming up as it should.\r\n\r\nThe dying back is caused by a beetle which bores into the twigs. The\r\ntwigs above the point where the beetle enters dies and then, of course,\r\nbuds come out from healthy wood below. No treatment has been devised\r\nagainst it, though its breeding ground is limited if all dead wood and\r\nbrush and litter is cleaned up and twigs are cut off below the point of\r\ninjury whenever the work of the insect is seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaspberry Cane Borer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what to do for my Loganberries and raspberries? A small\r\nworm got into them in the new growth of wood lost summer, right in the\r\ntips of the new growth of wood, and then worked down through the pith of\r\nthe wood, and as fast as they worked down the can wilted.\r\n\r\nThis is the raspberry horn-tail, or the cane-borer. The adults are\r\nwasp-like insects about a half-inch long and very active. They come out\r\nof the canes in spring and the females soon lay eggs in the tender tips\r\nof the young shoots. These eggs soon hatch and the larvae eat their way\r\nup toward the tip, which causes it to wither and die. It is this injury\r\nthat causes much notice. As the tip dies, the larvae turn and go down\r\ninto the canes, as in the sample sent, also injuring them greatly,\r\nthough possibly not killing them for some time. The only way to attack\r\nthem is to pinch the spots where the eggs were laid; then those that\r\nescape and cause the tips to wilt should be destroyed by cutting off the\r\ntips below the point of injury or cutting off the canes when they show\r\ndamage. Likewise, the insects work on the wild rose, and cutting all\r\nthose out around a place will prevent enough adults from developing to\r\npermit little damage to be done, always provided the berries are well\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl of Red Spider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you give directions for the prevention of injury by the red spider\r\nto almond and other trees in the Sacramento volley?\r\n\r\nThe red spider on almond and prune trees is usually controlled by the\r\nthorough application of dry sulphur to the foliage. On almonds the first\r\nsulphuring should be done as soon as the leaves appear in March. A\r\nsecond application is advised from the 1st to the 10th of May. A third\r\napplication should be made from the 1st to the 10th of June. Prune trees\r\nshould be treated as soon as the spider appears. In the Sacramento\r\nvalley this usually occurs about the first week of July. Full-grown\r\ntrees require about a pound of sulphur which should be thoroughly\r\ndistributed throughout the foliage. The old method of throwing a handful\r\nof sulphur in the branches of the tree or on the ground under the tree\r\nis valueless. The use of a blower is economical in large orchards, but a\r\ncan with perforated bottom is frequently used on young trees or small\r\norchards with good results. In normal seasons the spider is easily,\r\ncontrolled by dry sulphuring. When the pest does not yield to this\r\ntreatment, a spray is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquid Spray for Red Spider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any liquid spray I can use in my spraying that will kill the\r\nred spider without injuring the foliage of the almond?\r\n\r\nA liquid spray for red spider is made by taking sulphur 30 pounds; lime\r\n(reduced to milk form by water), 15 pounds; water, 200 gallons; or use\r\ncommercial lime-sulphur, 4 or 5 gallons to 200 gallons of water. These\r\nsprays can be applied without injuring the foliage. They are more\r\nexpensive in labor cost than dry sulphuring, but are more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple-Leaf Aphis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending herewith a small piece from one of my young apple trees. If\r\nyou can, will you kindly tell me what the insects are an it, and what I\r\nhad better do for them?\r\n\r\nThe apple twig which you send is infested with the eggs of the leaf\r\naphis or leaf louse. These eggs are very difficult to kill. A good\r\nthorough spraying with lime-sulphur might, however, get rid of many of\r\nthem and would be good for the trees otherwise - diluting according to\r\ncondition of tree growth. The chief campaign against the leaf aphis,\r\nhowever, must be made early in the growing season, just as these pests\r\nare beginning to hatch out and to accumulate under the leaves of the new\r\ngrowth. They should then be attacked with properly made kerosene\r\nemulsion or tobacco extract with a nozzle suited to land the spray on\r\nthe under side of the leaves. Unless these pests are attacked early in\r\nthe season and repeated if necessary, your apples on bearing trees will\r\nbe ruined so far as they attack them, being small, misshaped and\r\nworthless. On young trees the destruction of the foliage is fatal to\r\ngood growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWoolly Aphis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you kindly inform me what you consider the best treatment for apple\r\ntrees affected by woolly aphis?\r\n\r\nThe best way to kill the woolly aphis on the roots is to remove the\r\nearth from around the tree to a distance of one or two feet, according\r\nto the size of the tree, digging away a few inches of the surface soil,\r\nThen soak the soil around the tree with kerosene emulsion, properly\r\nmade, of 15 per cent strength, and replace the earth. Be sure you get a\r\ngood emulsion, for free oil is dangerous. For the insects above ground\r\non the twigs, a good spraying while the tree is out of leaf will kill\r\nmany, but some will survive for summer spraying, and for this a tobacco\r\nspray may be most convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlister Mite on Walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending you some walnut leaves with some swellings an them. They\r\nare very plentiful on some trees here. Is the trouble serious and will\r\nit spread?\r\n\r\nThis is merely Erinose, or Blister Mite, which is a very common trouble\r\non walnuts, but does not do enough damage to call for methods of\r\ncontrol. These swellings are caused by numerous, very small insects\r\nwhich live within the blisters on the under side of the leaf amongst a\r\nfelt-like, heavy growth which develops there. While this effect is very\r\ncommon, it produces no appreciable injury and needs no treatment for its\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScale on Apricots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know how to check the scale on apricot trees.\r\n\r\nThe most common scale on apricots, the brown apricot scale, is usually\r\nheld in check by the comys fusca, which is as widely distributed as the\r\nscale itself. If it gets beyond the parasite, you should spray in winter\r\nwith crude oil emulsion. If some scales are punctured or have a black\r\nspot on top, the comys fusca is busy and you probably will be safe\r\nenough without doing anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFumigating for Black Scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know the best method of eradicating the black scale from\r\nmy orange trees, whether by spraying or fumigation?\r\n\r\nSpraying has been given up as a suitable method for controlling the\r\nblack scale on citrus trees, and the only recognized method of merit\r\nwhere the scale is bad is by fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas. You\r\nshould communicate with your county horticultural commissioner, who,\r\nthrough inspectors, will see that you have a good job done, at the right\r\ntime and at as moderate price as is compatible with good work. It is\r\nimpossible to 'eradicate' the black scale, but there is a great\r\ndifference in the amount that can be killed, and it pays to have a job\r\ndone as near perfectly as possible. Similar methods of attacking other\r\nscale insects on citrus trees are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding Thrips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can the presence of pear thrips be detected in a prune orchard? Will\r\nthe distillate emulsion-nicotine spray control brown scale as well as\r\nthrips?\r\n\r\nYou can find thrips by shaking a cluster of blossoms, as soon as they\r\nopen, over a sheet of paper or in the palm of your hand. The thrips are\r\nvery minute, transparent, somewhat louse-like insects. The spray you\r\nmention would probably have little effect on the brown scale which would\r\nstill be in the egg state and under cover, at the time the early spring\r\nspraying for the thrips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl of Pear Slug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sending, under separate cover, some samples of cherry tree leaves\r\nthat have been attacked by a small snail or slug. Kindly let me know\r\nwhat they are, and how to rid the trees of them.\r\n\r\nThe creatures you speak of are the pear slugs, or the cherry slugs, as\r\nthey are sometimes known. Although slimy, like the big yellow slug that\r\nis a pest in vegetable gardens, it is no relation thereto, but is the\r\nlarva of an insect. Its olive green color, slimy appearance and the way\r\nit eats the surface of the leaves make it about the easiest of all\r\ninsects to identify. Parasites and predacious insects usually keep it in\r\nfair control. Whenever artificial methods of control are needed the\r\nslugs can best be destroyed by sprinkling dust of any kind upon them. If\r\nyou can get a machine for sulphuring a vineyard and use some air slaked\r\nlime or other fine dust, it will fix them quickly and inexpensively,\r\nthough any way of applying dust may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutworms and Young Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat method should be used to protect young fruit trees from cutworms?\r\n\r\nHoe around the trees or vines and kill the fat, greasy grubs which you\r\nwill find near the foliage. Put out a poisoned bait which the worms like\r\nbetter than the foliage, viz. Bran, 10 pounds; white arsenic, 1/2 pound;\r\nmolasses, 1/2 gallon; water, 2 gallons. Mix the arsenic with the bran\r\ndry. Add the molasses to the water and mix into the bran, making a moist\r\npaste. Put a tablespoonful near the base of the tree or vine and lock up\r\nthe chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl of Squash Bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are troubled with pumpkin bugs. Please tell us what to do for them.\r\n\r\nWhen the bugs first make their appearance in the field they can be\r\neasily disposed of by hand picking and dropping into a bucket containing\r\nabout two inches of water with about one-fourth inch of kerosene on top\r\nto kill the bugs. The picking should be done in the morning, as the bugs\r\nare apt to fly in the warm part of the day and scatter where already\r\npicked. Two persons can pick over an acre in one and a half hours, and\r\ntwo pickings are usually sufficient for a season, as after the vines\r\nbegin to run over the ground pretty well the bugs will not be able to\r\nhurt them much. A pair of thin old gloves will help to keep off one's\r\nhands some of the perfume from the bugs. The sooner the work starts the\r\nfewer bugs to pick. Cleaning up of all old vines in the fall and\r\nremoving litter in which the mature bugs hide for the winter will permit\r\nless eggs to be laid in the spring and there will be fewer bugs to pick\r\nas a result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Corn Worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year all my ears of corn were infested with maggot, growing fat\r\nthereon. Can you help me scare them away?\r\n\r\nYou have to do with the so-called corn worm which is very abundant in\r\nthis State and one of the greatest pests to corn growing. It is the same\r\ninsect which is known as the boll worm of the cotton in the Southern\r\nStates. No satisfactory method of controlling this has been found,\r\nalthough a great deal of experimentation has been done. Nearly\r\neverything that could be thought of has been tried without very\r\nsatisfactory results. A late planted corn has sometimes been free, for\r\nthe insect is not in the laying stage then. If it were not for this\r\ninsect the canning of corn would be an important industry in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelon Lice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have in about four acres of watermelons, and there seem to be lice and\r\na small gnat or fly, and also some small green bugs and white worms on\r\nthe under part of the leaves, which seem to be stopping the growth of\r\nthe vines, making them wilt and die. They seem to be more in patches,\r\nalthough a few on all the vines. Can you please tell me what to do for\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nMelon lice are very hard to catch up with after you have let them get a\r\nstart. Spraying with oil emulsions, tobacco extracts, soap solutions,\r\netc., will all kill the lice if you get it onto them with a good spray\r\npump and suitable nozzles for reaching the under sides of the leaves.\r\nThe gnats you speak of are the winged forms of the lice; the white worms\r\nmay be eating the lice; the \"small green bugs\" may be diabroticas. If\r\nyou had started in lively as soon as you saw the first lice you could\r\nhave destroyed them in the places where they started. Now your chance\r\nlies largely in the natural multiplication of ladybirds and the\r\noccurrence of hot winds which will burn up the lice. It is too late\r\nprobably, to undertake spraying the whole field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWire Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any way to destroy or overcome the destructive work of the\r\nwireworm, which I find in some spots takes the lion's share of crops,\r\nsuch as beans, potatoes, onions, etc.?\r\n\r\nWe do not know any easy way with wire worms. Nitrate of soda is believed\r\nto kill or repel them, but you have to be careful with it, for too much\r\nwill either over-stimulate or kill the kill; about 200 pounds per acre,\r\nwell distributed, is the usual prescription for the good of the plants.\r\nWire worms can probably be killed with carbon bisulphide, using a\r\ntablespoonful poured into holes about a foot deep, three or four feet\r\napart. The vapor would permeate the soil and kill all ground insects,\r\nbut the acre-cost of such treatment must be measured in its relation to\r\nthe value of the crop. The most promising policy with wire worms is\r\nrotation of crops, starving them out with a grain or grass crop and not\r\ngrowing such crops as you mention continually on the same land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBean Weevil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I keep certain insects from getting into my dry beans? I have\r\nfinished picking the crop. Every year a little, short, stubby beetle\r\ngets in them before spring and makes them unfit for use.\r\n\r\nYou have to do with the bean weevil. The eggs are inserted by the insect\r\nwhile the beans are still green in the pods; subsequently the eggs hatch\r\nand the worm excavates the interior of the ripened beans. The beans can\r\nbe protected after ripening by heating carefully to 130° Fahrenheit,\r\nwhich will destroy the egg, or the larva if already hatched. Of course,\r\nthis heating must be done cautiously and with the aid of a good\r\nthermometer for fear of destroying the germinating power. The work of\r\nthe insect can also be stopped by putting the beans in a barrel or other\r\nclose receptacle, with a saucer containing about an ounce of carbon\r\nbi-sulfid to vaporize. Be careful not to approach the vapor with a\r\nlight. After treatment for one-half hour, the cover can be removed and\r\nthe vapor will entirely dissipate. This is a safer treatment than the\r\nheating. Similar methods of control can be used on other pea and bean\r\nweevils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlugs in Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you advise me how I can get rid of slugs in my garden?\r\n\r\nWhen barriers of lime, ashes, etc., are ineffective, traps consisting of\r\npieces of board sacking and similar materials placed about the field\r\nprove inviting to the slugs. They collect under these and by going over\r\nthe field in the early morning they may be put into a salt-water\r\nsolution or otherwise destroyed. Arsenical sprays applied with an\r\nunderspray nozzle to the lower surface of the leaves will help control\r\nthe slugs. Poison bran mash consisting of 16 pounds of coarse bran, 2\r\nquarts of cheap syrup, and enough warm water to make a coarse mash, is\r\nvery good for cutworms and should be equally effective for slugs. It\r\nshould be placed in small heaps about the plants to be protected.\r\nCabbage leaves dipped in grease drippings and placed about the fields\r\nalso prove attractive bait for the slugs, which may then be collected\r\nthere. If a person has a taste for poultry, the keeping of a few ducks\r\nmay solve the slug problem without further bother. Cultivation or\r\nirrigation methods that give a dry surface most of the time also\r\ndiscourage these pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause of Mottle Leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause and cure of mottle leaf of citrus trees?\r\n\r\nThere are apparently a number of causes of this trouble, all more or\r\nless obscure and hard to overcome. It is generally thought that it is\r\ndue to poor nutrition, whatever the reason for poor nutrition might be.\r\nThe presence of a nematode or eel worm on the roots has found to be a\r\ncause of mottle leaf in many cases. Poor drainage, too sandy soil and a\r\nnumber of other things frequently cause it. Whatever the cause, no one\r\ngood method of cure has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Scab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think most of my potatoes will have some scab. Will you please tell me\r\nif my next crop would be apt to have scab, provided I got good clean\r\nseed and planted in the same ground?\r\n\r\nIt seems demonstrated that a treatment of the seed will practically\r\ninsure against potato scab. One method is dipping the potatoes in a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate. Dissolve one ounce in eight gallons of\r\nwater and soak the seed potatoes in this solution for one and one-half\r\nhours before cutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGopher Poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some alfalfa, some hogs and some gophers, also some strychnine\r\nand carrots. If I put the strychnine on the carrots, and endeavor to\r\npoison the gophers, and the hogs get hold of the poison will it kill\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nYou will find that hogs are liable to poison like any other animal, and\r\nthe safest way to poison the gophers, while the hogs are running in the\r\nfield is to bury the poisoned carrots very deeply in the gopher hole and\r\nthen put a row of sticks or branches over the mouth of the hole so that\r\nthe hogs cannot root around and get at the poisoned carrots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Make Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse copper sulphate (bluestone) 5 pounds; quick-lime (good stone lime),\r\n6 pounds; water, 50 gallons. Put the bluestone in a sack and hang it so\r\nit will be suspended just under the surface of a barrel of water over\r\nnight, or dissolve in hot water. Use one gallon of water to one pound of\r\nbluestone. Slake the lime in a separate barrel, using just enough water\r\nto make a smooth, clean, thin whitewash. Stir this vigorously. Use\r\nwooden vessels only. Fill the spray tank half full of water, add one\r\ngallon of bluestone solution for each pound required, then strain in the\r\nlime and the remainder of the water and stir thoroughly. The formula may\r\nbe varied according to conditions, using from 3 to 8 pounds of bluestone\r\nto 50 gallons of water and an equal or slight excess of lime. Use the\r\nstronger mixture in rainy weather. Keep the mixture constantly agitated\r\nwhile applying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormula for Lime-Sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make lime-sulphur take quick-lime, 20 pounds; ground sulphur, 15\r\npounds and water 30 gallons. Slake the lime with hot water in a large\r\nkettle, add the sulphur and stir well together. After the violent\r\nslaking subsides add more water and boil the mixture over a fire for at\r\nleast one hour. After boiling sufficiently strain into the spray tank\r\nand dilute with water to the proper strength. If a steam boiler is\r\navailable, this mixture may be prepared more easily on a large scale by\r\ncooking in barrels into which steam pipes are introduced. This mixture\r\ncannot be applied safely except during the winter when the trees are\r\ndormant. A large proportion of the lime-sulphur used in the State is\r\npurchased already prepared in more concentrated form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit Growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmond\r\n
