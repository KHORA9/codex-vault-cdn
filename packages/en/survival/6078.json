A word of\r\nexplanation is therefore needed. I thought little at first of the\r\ngeneral public, when I began to weave together in narrative form\r\nthe facts, letters, and journals contained in this volume. My chief\r\nobject was to prevent the dispersion and final loss of scattered\r\npapers which had an unquestionable family value. But, as my work\r\ngrew upon my hands, I began to feel that the story of an\r\nintellectual life, which was marked by such rare coherence and\r\nunity of aim, might have a wider interest and usefulness; might,\r\nperhaps, serve as a stimulus and an encouragement to others. For\r\nthis reason, and also because I am inclined to believe that the\r\nEuropean portion of the life of Louis Agassiz is little known in\r\nhis adopted country, while its American period must be unfamiliar\r\nto many in his native land, I have determined to publish the\r\nmaterial here collected.\r\n\r\nThe book labors under the disadvantage of being in great part a\r\ntranslation. The correspondence for the first part was almost\r\nwholly in French and German, so that the choice lay between a\r\npatch-work of several languages or the unity of one, burdened as it\r\nmust be with the change of version. I have accepted what seemed to\r\nme the least of these difficulties.\r\n\r\nBesides the assistance of my immediate family, including the\r\nrevision of the text by my son Alexander Agassiz, I have been\r\nindebted to my friends Dr. and Mrs. Hagen and to the late Professor\r\nGuyot for advice on special points. As will be seen from the list\r\nof illustrations, I have also to thank Mrs. John W. Elliot for her\r\nvaluable aid in that part of the work.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the water I have had most faithful and\r\nefficient collaborators. Mr. Auguste Agassiz, who survived his\r\nbrother Louis several years, and took the greatest interest in\r\npreserving whatever concerned his scientific career, confided to my\r\nhands many papers and documents belonging to his brother's earlier\r\nlife. After his death, his cousin and brother-in-law, Mr. Auguste\r\nMayor, of Neuchatel, continued the same affectionate service.\r\nWithout their aid I could not have completed the narrative as it\r\nnow stands.\r\n\r\nThe friend last named also selected from the glacier of the Aar, at\r\nthe request of Alexander Agassiz, the boulder which now marks his\r\nfather's grave. With unwearied patience Mr. Mayor passed hours of\r\ntoilsome search among the blocks of the moraine near the site of\r\nthe old \"Hotel des Neuchatelois,\" and chose at last a stone so\r\nmonumental in form that not a touch of the hammer was needed to fit\r\nit for its purpose. In conclusion I allow myself the pleasure of\r\nrecording here my gratitude to him and to all who have aided me in\r\nmy work.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH C.

IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\n1807-1827: TO AGE 20.\r\n\r\nBirthplace.\r\nInfluence of his Mother.\r\nEarly Love of Natural History.\r\nBoyish Occupations.\r\nDomestic Education.\r\nFirst School.\r\nVacations.\r\nCommercial Life renounced.\r\nCollege of Lausanne.\r\nChoice of Profession.\r\nMedical School of Zurich.\r\nLife and Studies there.\r\nUniversity of Heidelberg.\r\nStudies interrupted by Illness.\r\nReturn to Switzerland.\r\nOccupations during Convalescence.\r\n\r\nJEAN LOUIS RODOLPHE AGASSIZ was born May 28, 1807, at the village\r\nof Motier, on the Lake of Morat. His father, Louis Rodolphe\r\nAgassiz, was a clergyman; his mother, Rose Mayor, was the daughter\r\nof a physician whose home was at Cudrefin, on the shore of the Lake\r\nof Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nThe parsonages in Switzerland are frequently pretty and\r\npicturesque. That of Motier, looking upon the lake and sheltered by\r\na hill which commands a view over the whole chain of the Bernese\r\nAlps, was especially so. It possessed a vineyard large enough to\r\nadd something in good years to the small salary of the pastor; an\r\norchard containing, among other trees, an apricot famed the country\r\naround for the unblemished beauty of its abundant fruit; a good\r\nvegetable garden, and a delicious spring of water flowing always\r\nfresh and pure into a great stone basin behind the house. That\r\nstone basin was Agassiz's first aquarium; there he had his first\r\ncollection of fishes.* (* After his death a touching tribute was\r\npaid to his memory by the inhabitants of his birthplace. With\r\nappropriate ceremonies, a marble slab was placed above the door of\r\nthe parsonage of Motier, with this inscription, \"J. Louis Agassiz,\r\ncelebre naturaliste, est ne dans cette maison, le 28 Mai, 1807.\")\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that he had any precocious predilection for\r\nstudy, and his parents, who for the first ten years of his life\r\nwere his only teachers, were too wise to stimulate his mind beyond\r\nthe ordinary attainments of his age. having lost her first four\r\nchildren in infancy, his mother watched with trembling solicitude\r\nover his early years. It was perhaps for this reason that she was\r\ndrawn so closely to her boy, and understood that his love of\r\nnature, and especially of all living things, was an intellectual\r\ntendency, and not simply a child's disposition to find friends and\r\nplaymates in the animals about him. In later years her sympathy\r\ngave her the key to the work of his manhood, as it had done to the\r\nsports of his childhood. She remained his most intimate friend to\r\nthe last hour of her life, and he survived her but six years.\r\n\r\nLouis's love of natural history showed itself almost from infancy.\r\nWhen a very little fellow he had, beside his collection of fishes,\r\nall sorts of pets: birds, field-mice, hares, rabbits, guinea-pigs,\r\netc., whose families he reared with the greatest care. Guided by\r\nhis knowledge of the haunts and habits of fishes, he and his\r\nbrother Auguste became the most adroit of young fishermen,--using\r\nprocesses all their own and quite independent of hook, line, or\r\nnet. Their hunting grounds were the holes and crevices beneath the\r\nstones or in the water-washed walls of the lake shore. No such\r\nshelter was safe from their curious fingers, and they acquired such\r\ndexterity that when bathing they could seize the fish even in the\r\nopen water, attracting them by little arts to which the fish\r\nsubmitted as to a kind of fascination. Such amusements are no doubt\r\nthe delight of many a lad living in the country, nor would they be\r\nworth recording except as illustrating the unity of Agassiz's\r\nintellectual development from beginning to end. His pet animals\r\nsuggested questions, to answer which was the task of his life; and\r\nhis intimate study of the fresh-water fishes of Europe, later the\r\nsubject of one of his important works, began with his first\r\ncollection from the Lake of Morat.\r\n\r\nAs a boy he amused himself also with all kinds of handicrafts on a\r\nsmall scale. The carpenter, the cobbler, the tailor, were then as\r\nmuch developed in him as the naturalist. In Swiss villages it was\r\nthe habit in those days for the trades-people to go from house to\r\nhouse in their different vocations. The shoemaker came two or three\r\ntimes a year with all his materials, and made shoes for the whole\r\nfamily by the day; the tailor came to fit them for garments which\r\nhe made in the house; the cooper arrived before the vintage, to\r\nrepair old barrels and hogsheads or to make new ones, and to\r\nreplace their worn-out hoops; in short, to fit up the cellar for\r\nthe coming season. Agassiz seems to have profited by these lessons\r\nas much as by those he learned from his father; and when a very\r\nlittle fellow, he could cut and put together a well-fitting pair of\r\nshoes for his sisters' dolls, was no bad tailor, and could make a\r\nminiature barrel that was perfectly water-tight. He remembered\r\nthese trivial facts as a valuable part of his incidental education.\r\nHe said he owed much of his dexterity in manipulation, to the\r\ntraining of eye and hand gained in these childish plays.\r\n\r\nThough fond of quiet, in-door occupation, he was an active, daring\r\nboy. One winter day when about seven years of age, he was skating\r\nwith his little brother Auguste, two years younger than himself,\r\nand a number of other boys, near the shore of the lake. They were\r\ntalking of a great fair held that day at the town of Morat, on the\r\nopposite side of the lake, to which M. Agassiz had gone in the\r\nmorning, not crossing upon the ice, however, but driving around the\r\nshore. The temptation was too strong for Louis, and he proposed to\r\nAuguste that they should skate across, join their father at the\r\nfair, and come home with him in the afternoon. They started\r\naccordingly. The other boys remained on their skating ground till\r\ntwelve o'clock, the usual dinner hour, when they returned to the\r\nvillage. Mme. Agassiz was watching for her boys, thinking them\r\nrather late, and on inquiring for them among the troop of urchins\r\ncoming down the village street she learned on what errand they had\r\ngone. Her anxiety may be imagined. The lake was not less than two\r\nmiles across, and she was by no means sure that the ice was safe.\r\nShe hurried to an upper window with a spy-glass to see if she could\r\ndescry them anywhere. At the moment she caught sight of them,\r\nalready far on their journey, Louis had laid himself down across a\r\nfissure in the ice, thus making a bridge for his little brother,\r\nwho was creeping over his back. Their mother directed a workman, an\r\nexcellent skater, to follow them as swiftly as possible. He\r\novertook them just as they had gained the shore, but it did not\r\noccur to him that they could return otherwise than they had come,\r\nand he skated back with them across the lake. Weary, hungry, and\r\ndisappointed, the boys reached the house without having seen the\r\nfair or enjoyed the drive home with their father in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWhen he was ten years old, Agassiz was sent to the college for boys\r\nat Bienne, thus exchanging the easy rule of domestic instruction\r\nfor the more serious studies of a public school. He found himself\r\non a level with his class, however, for his father was an admirable\r\nteacher. Indeed it would seem that Agassiz's own passion for\r\nteaching, as well as his love of young people and his sympathy with\r\nintellectual aspiration everywhere, was an inheritance. Wherever\r\nhis father was settled as pastor, at Motier, at Orbe, and later at\r\nConcise, his influence was felt in the schools as much as in the\r\npulpit. A piece of silver remains, a much prized heir-loom in the\r\nfamily, given to him by the municipality of Orbe in acknowledgment\r\nof his services in the schools.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the school at Bienne were rather strict, but the life\r\nled by the boys was hardy and invigorating, and they played as\r\nheartily as they worked. Remembering his own school-life, Agassiz\r\noften asked himself whether it was difference of climate or of\r\nmethod, which makes the public school life in the United States so\r\nmuch more trying to the health of children than the one under which\r\nhe was brought up. The boys and girls in our public schools are\r\nsaid to be overworked with a session of five hours, and an\r\nadditional hour or two of study at home. At the College of Bienne\r\nthere were nine hours of study, and the boys were healthy and\r\nhappy. Perhaps the secret might be found in the frequent\r\ninterruption, two or three hours of study alternating with an\r\ninterval for play or rest. Agassiz always retained a pleasant\r\nimpression of the school and its teachers. Mr. Rickly, the\r\ndirector, he regarded with an affectionate respect, which ripened\r\ninto friendship in maturer years.\r\n\r\nThe vacations were, of course, hailed with delight, and as Motier\r\nwas but twenty miles distant from Bienne, Agassiz and his younger\r\nbrother Auguste, who joined him at school a year later, were in the\r\nhabit of making the journey on foot. The lives of these brothers\r\nwere so closely interwoven in their youth that for many years the\r\nstory of one includes the story of the other. They had everything\r\nin common, and with their little savings they used to buy books,\r\nchosen by Louis, the foundation, as it proved, of his future\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nLong before dawn on the first day of vacation the two bright,\r\nactive boys would be on their homeward way, as happy as holiday\r\ncould make them, especially if they were returning for the summer\r\nharvest or the autumn vintage. The latter was then, as now, a\r\nseason of festivity. In these more modern days something of its\r\nprimitive picturesqueness may have been lost; but when Agassiz was\r\na boy, all the ordinary occupations were given up for this\r\nimportant annual business, in which work and play were so happily\r\ncombined. On the appointed day the working people might be seen\r\ntrooping in from neighboring cantons, where there were no\r\nvineyards, to offer themselves for the vintage. They either camped\r\nout at night, sleeping in the open air, or found shelter in the\r\nstables and outhouses. During the grape gathering the floor of the\r\nbarn and shed at the parsonage of Motier was often covered in the\r\nevening with tired laborers, both men and women. Of course, when\r\nthe weather was fine, these were festival days for the children. A\r\nbushel basket, heaped high with white and amber bunches, stood in\r\nthe hall, or in the living room of the family, and young and old\r\nwere free to help themselves as they came and went. Then there were\r\nthe frolics in the vineyard, the sweet cup of must (unfermented\r\njuice of the grape), and, the ball on the last evening at the close\r\nof the merry-making.\r\n\r\nSometimes the boys passed their vacations at Cudrefin, with their\r\ngrandfather Mayor. He was a kind old man, much respected in his\r\nprofession, and greatly beloved for his benevolence. His little\r\nwhite horse was well known in all the paths and by-roads of the\r\ncountry around, as he went from village to village among the sick.\r\nThe grandmother was frail in health, but a great favorite among the\r\nchildren, for whom she had an endless fund of stories, songs, and\r\nhymns. Aunt Lisette, an unmarried daughter, who long lived to\r\nmaintain the hospitality of the old Cudrefin house and to be\r\nbeloved as the kindest of maiden aunts by two or three generations\r\nof nephews and nieces, was the domestic providence of these family\r\ngatherings, where the praises of her excellent dishes were annually\r\nsung. The roof was elastic; there was no question about numbers,\r\nfor all came who could; the more, the merrier, with no diminution\r\nof good cheer.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday after Easter was the great popular fete. Then every\r\nhouse was busy coloring Easter eggs and making fritters. The young\r\ngirls and the lads of the village, the former in their prettiest\r\ndresses and the latter with enormous bouquets of artificial flowers\r\nin their hats, went together to church in the morning. In the\r\nafternoon the traditional match between two runners, chosen from\r\nthe village youths, took place. They were dressed in white, and\r\nadorned with bright ribbons. With music before them, and followed\r\nby all the young people, they went in procession to the place where\r\na quantity of Easter eggs had been distributed upon the ground. At\r\na signal the runners separated, the one to pick up the eggs\r\naccording to a prescribed course, the other to run to the next\r\nvillage and back again. The victory was to the one who accomplished\r\nhis task first, and he was proclaimed king of the feast. Hand in\r\nhand the runners, followed as before by all their companions,\r\nreturned to join in the dance now to take place before the house of\r\nDr. Mayor. After a time the festivities were interrupted by a\r\nlittle address in patois from the first musician, who concluded by\r\nannouncing from his platform a special dance in honor of the family\r\nof Dr. Mayor. In this dance the family with some of their friends\r\nand neighbors took part,--the young ladies dancing with the peasant\r\nlads and the young gentlemen with the girls of the village,--while\r\nthe rest formed a circle to look on.\r\n\r\nThus, between study and recreation, the four years which Agassiz's\r\nfather and mother intended he should pass at Bienne drew to a\r\nclose. A yellow, time-worn sheet of foolscap, on which during the\r\nlast year of his school-life he wrote his desiderata in the way of\r\nbooks, tells something of his progress and his aspirations at\r\nfourteen years of age. \"I wish,\" so it runs, \"to advance in the\r\nsciences, and for that I need d'Anville, Ritter, an Italian\r\ndictionary, a Strabo in Greek, Mannert and Thiersch; and also the\r\nworks of Malte-Brun and Seyfert. I have resolved, as far as I am\r\nallowed to do so, to become a man of letters, and at present I can\r\ngo no further: 1st, in ancient geography, for I already know all my\r\nnotebooks, and I have only such books as Mr. Rickly can lend me; I\r\nmust have d'Anville or Mannert; 2nd, in modern geography, also, I\r\nhave only such books as Mr. Rickly can lend me, and the Osterwald\r\ngeography, which does not accord with the new divisions; I must\r\nhave Ritter or Malte-Brun; 3rd, for Greek I need a new grammar, and\r\nI shall choose Thiersch; 4th, I have no Italian dictionary, except\r\none lent me by Mr. Moltz; I must have one; 5th, for Latin I need a\r\nlarger grammar than the one I have, and I should like Seyfert; 6th,\r\nMr. Rickly tells me that as I have a taste for geography he will\r\ngive me a lesson in Greek (gratis), in which we would translate\r\nStrabo, provided I can find one. For all this I ought to have about\r\ntwelve louis. I should like to stay at Bienne till the month of\r\nJuly, and afterward serve my apprenticeship in commerce at\r\nNeuchatel for a year and a half. Then I should like to pass four\r\nyears at a university in Germany, and finally finish my studies at\r\nParis, where I would stay about five years. Then, at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, I could begin to write.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz's note-books, preserved by his parents, who followed the\r\neducation of their children with the deepest interest, give\r\nevidence of his faithful work both at school and college. They form\r\na great pile of manuscript, from the paper copy-books of the\r\nschool-boy to the carefully collated reports of the college\r\nstudent, begun when the writer was ten or eleven years of age and\r\ncontinued with little interruption till he was eighteen or\r\nnineteen. The later volumes are of nearly quarto size and very\r\nthick, some of them containing from four to six hundred closely\r\ncovered pages; the handwriting is small, no doubt for economy of\r\nspace, but very clear. The subjects are physiological,\r\npathological, and anatomical, with more or less of general natural\r\nhistory. This series of books is kept with remarkable neatness.\r\nEven in the boy's copy-books, containing exercises in Greek, Latin,\r\nFrench and German, with compositions on a variety of topics, the\r\nwriting is even and distinct, with scarcely a blot or an erasure.\r\nFrom the very beginning there is a careful division of subjects\r\nunder clearly marked headings, showing even then a tendency toward\r\nan orderly classification of facts and thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the boyish sketch which he drew of his future\r\nplans that the hope of escaping the commercial life projected for\r\nhim, and of dedicating himself to letters and learning, was already\r\ndawning. He had begun to feel the charm of study, and his\r\nscientific tastes, though still pursued rather as the pastimes of a\r\nboy than as the investigations of a student, were nevertheless\r\nbecoming more and more absorbing. He was fifteen years old and the\r\ntime had come when, according to a purpose long decided upon, he\r\nwas to leave school and enter the business house of his uncle,\r\nFrancois Mayor, at Neuchatel. He begged for a farther delay, to be\r\nspent in two additional years of study at the College of Lausanne.\r\nHe was supported in his request by several of his teachers, and\r\nespecially by Mr. Rickly, who urged his parents to encourage the\r\nremarkable intelligence and zeal already shown by their son in his\r\nstudies. They were not difficult to persuade; indeed, only want of\r\nmeans, never want of will, limited the educational advantages they\r\ngave to their children.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, therefore, that he should go to Lausanne. Here his\r\nlove for everything bearing on the study of nature was confirmed.\r\nProfessor Chavannes, Director of the Cantonal Museum, in whom he\r\nfound not only an interesting teacher, but a friend who sympathized\r\nwith his favorite tastes, possessed the only collection of Natural\r\nHistory in the Canton de Vaud. To this Agassiz now had access. His\r\nuncle, Dr. Mathias Mayor, his mother's brother and a physician of\r\nnote in Lausanne, whose opinion had great weight with M. and Mme.\r\nAgassiz, was also attracted by the boy's intelligent interest in\r\nanatomy and kindred subjects. He advised that his nephew should be\r\nallowed to study medicine, and at the close of Agassiz's college\r\ncourse at Lausanne the commercial plan was finally abandoned, and\r\nhe was permitted to choose the medical profession as the one most\r\nakin to his inclination.\r\n\r\nBeing now seventeen years of age, he went to the medical school of\r\nZurich. Here, for the first time, he came into contact with men\r\nwhose instruction derived freshness and vigor from their original\r\nresearches. He was especially indebted to Professor Schinz, a man\r\nof learning and ability, who held the chair of Natural History and\r\nPhysiology, and who showed the warmest interest in his pupil's\r\nprogress. He gave Agassiz a key to his private library, as well as\r\nto his collection of birds. This liberality was invaluable to one\r\nwhose poverty made books an unattainable luxury. Many an hour did\r\nthe young student pass at that time in copying books which were\r\nbeyond his means, though some of them did not cost more than a\r\ndollar a volume. His brother Auguste, still his constant companion,\r\nshared this task, a pure labor of love with him, for the books were\r\nmore necessary to Louis's studies than to his own.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years passed by Agassiz in Zurich he saw little of\r\nsociety beyond the walls of the university. His brother and he had\r\na pleasant home in a private house, where they shared the family\r\nlife of their host and hostess. In company with them, Agassiz made\r\nhis first excursion of any importance into the Alps. They ascended\r\nthe Righi and passed the night there. At about sunset a fearful\r\nthunder-storm gathered below them, while on the summit of the\r\nmountain the weather remained perfectly clear and calm. Under a\r\nblue sky they watched the lightning, and listened to the thunder in\r\nthe dark clouds, which were pouring torrents of rain upon the plain\r\nand the Lake of Lucerne. The storm lasted long after night had\r\nclosed in, and Agassiz lingered when all his companions had retired\r\nto rest, till at last the clouds drifted softly away, letting down\r\nthe light of moon and stars on the lake and landscape. He used to\r\nsay that in his subsequent Alpine excursions he had rarely\r\nwitnessed a scene of greater beauty.\r\n\r\nSuch of his letters from Zurich as have been preserved have only a\r\nhome interest. In one of them, however, he alludes to a curious\r\ncircumstance, which might have changed the tenor of his life. He\r\nand his brother were returning on foot, for the vacation, from\r\nZurich to their home which was now in Orbe, where their father and\r\nmother had been settled since 1821. Between Neuchatel and Orbe they\r\nwere overtaken by a traveling carriage. A gentleman who was its\r\nsole occupant invited them to get in, made them welcome to his\r\nlunch, talked to them of their student life, and their future\r\nplans, and drove them to the parsonage, where he introduced himself\r\nto their parents. Some days afterward M. Agassiz received a letter\r\nfrom this chance acquaintance, who proved to be a man in affluent\r\ncircumstances, of good social position, living at the time in\r\nGeneva. He wrote to M. Agassiz that he had been singularly\r\nattracted by his elder son, Louis, and that he wished to adopt him,\r\nassuming henceforth all the responsibility of his education and his\r\nestablishment in life. This proposition fell like a bomb-shell into\r\nthe quiet parsonage. M. Agassiz was poor, and every advantage for\r\nhis children was gained with painful self-sacrifice on the part of\r\nboth parents. How then refuse such an opportunity for one among\r\nthem, and that one so gifted? After anxious reflection, however,\r\nthe father, with the full concurrence of his son, decided to\r\ndecline an offer which, brilliant as it seemed, involved a\r\nseparation and might lead to a false position. A correspondence was\r\nkept up for years between Louis and the friend he had so suddenly\r\nwon, and who continued to interest himself in his career. Although\r\nit had no sequel, this incident is mentioned as showing a kind of\r\npersonal magnetism which, even as child and boy, Agassiz\r\nunconsciously exercised over others.\r\n\r\nFrom Zurich, Agassiz went to the University of Heidelberg, where we\r\nfind him in the spring of 1826.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, April 24, 1826.\r\n\r\n. . .Having arrived early enough to see something of the environs\r\nbefore the opening of the term, I decided to devote each day to a\r\nramble in one direction or another, in order to become familiar\r\nwith my surroundings. I am the more glad to have done this as I\r\nhave learned that after the lectures begin there will be no further\r\nchance for such interruptions, and we shall be obliged to stick\r\nclosely to our work at home.\r\n\r\nOur first excursion was to Neckarsteinach, two and a half leagues\r\nfrom here. The road follows the Neckar, and at certain places rises\r\nboldly above the river, which flows between two hills, broken by\r\nrocks of the color of red chalk, which often jut out from either\r\nside. Farther on the valley widens, and a pretty rising ground,\r\ncrowned by ruins, suddenly presents itself in the midst of a wide\r\nplain, where sheep are feeding. Neckarsteinach itself is only a\r\nlittle village, containing, however, three castles, two of which\r\nare in ruins. The third is still inhabited, and commands a\r\nmagnificent view. In the evening we returned to Heidelberg by\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nAnother day we started for what is here called \"The Mountain,\"\r\nthough it is at most no higher than Le Suchet. As the needful\r\nsupplies are not to be obtained there, we took our provisions with\r\nus. We had so much fun out of this, that I must tell you all about\r\nit. In the morning Z--bought at the market veal, liver, and bacon\r\nenough to serve for three persons during two days. To these\r\nsupplies we added salt, pepper, butter, onions, bread, and some\r\njugs of beer. One of us took two saucepans for cooking, and some\r\nalcohol. Arrived at the summit of our mountain, we looked out for a\r\nconvenient spot, and there we cooked our dinner. It did not take\r\nlong, nor can I say whether all was done according to the rules of\r\nart. But this I know,--that never did a meal seem to me better. We\r\nwandered over the mountain for the rest of the day, and at evening\r\ncame to a house where we prepared our supper after the same\r\nfashion, to the great astonishment of the assembled household, and\r\nespecially of an old woman who regretted the death of her husband,\r\nbecause she said it would certainly have amused him. We slept on\r\nthe ground on some straw, and returned to Heidelberg the next day\r\nin time for dinner. The following day we went to Mannheim to visit\r\nthe theatre. It is very handsome and well appointed, and we were\r\nfortunate in happening upon an excellent opera. Beyond this, I saw\r\nnothing of Mannheim except the house of Kotzebue and the place\r\nwhere Sand was beheaded.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have made my visits to the professors. For three among\r\nthem I had letters from Professors Schinz and Hirzel. I was\r\nreceived by all in the kindest way. Professor Tiedemann, the\r\nChancellor, is a man about the age of papa and young for his years.\r\nHe is so well-known that I need not undertake his panegyric here.\r\nAs soon as I told him that I brought a letter from Zurich, he\r\nshowed me the greatest politeness, offered me books from his\r\nlibrary; in one word, said he would be for me here what Professor\r\nSchinz, with whom he had formerly studied, had been for me in\r\nZurich. After the opening of the term, when I know these gentlemen\r\nbetter, I will tell you more about them. I have still to describe\r\nmy home, chamber, garden, people of the house, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next letter fills in this frame-work.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, May 24, 1826.\r\n\r\n. . .According to your request, I am going to write you all\r\npossible details about my host, the employment of my time, etc.,\r\netc. Mr.--, my \"philister,\" is a tobacco merchant in easy\r\ncircumstances, having a pretty house in the faubourg of the city.\r\nMy windows overlook the town, and my prospect is bounded by a hill\r\nsituated to the north of Heidelberg. At the back of the house is a\r\nlarge and fine garden, at the foot of which is a very pretty\r\nsummer-house. There are also several clumps of trees in the garden,\r\nand an aviary filled with native birds. . .\r\n\r\nSince each day in term time is only the repetition of every other,\r\nthe account of one will give an idea of all, especially as I follow\r\nwith regularity the plan of study I have formed. Every morning I\r\nrise at six o'clock, dress, and breakfast. At seven I go to my\r\nlectures, given during the morning in the Museum building, next to\r\nwhich is the anatomical laboratory. If, in the interval, I have a\r\nfree hour, as sometimes happens from ten to eleven, I occupy it in\r\nmaking anatomical preparations. I shall tell you more of that and\r\nof the Museum another time. From twelve to one I practice fencing.\r\nWe dine at about one o'clock, after which I walk till two, when I\r\nreturn to the house and to my studies till five o'clock. From five\r\nto six we have a lecture from the renowned Tiedemann. After that, I\r\neither take a bath in the Neckar or another walk. From eight to\r\nnine I resume my special work, and then, according to my\r\ninclination, go to the Swiss club, or, if I am tired, to bed. I\r\nhave my evening service and talk silently with you, believing that\r\nat that hour you also do not forget your Louis, who thinks always\r\nof you. . .As soon as I know, for I cannot yet make an exact\r\nestimate, I will write you as nearly as possible what my expenses\r\nare likely to be. Sometimes there may be unlooked-for expenditures,\r\nas, for instance, six crowns for a matriculation paper. But be\r\nassured that at all events I shall restrict myself to what is\r\nabsolutely necessary, and do my best to economize. The same of the\r\nprobable duration of my stay in Heidelberg; I shall certainly not\r\nprolong it needlessly. . .\r\n\r\nNow for the first time the paths of the two brothers separated,\r\nAuguste returning from Zurich to Neuchatel, where he entered into\r\nbusiness. It chanced, however, that in one of the first\r\nacquaintances made by Louis in Heidelberg he found not only a\r\ncongenial comrade, but a friend for life, and in after years a\r\nbrother. Professor Tiedemann, by whom Agassiz had been so kindly\r\nreceived, recommended him to seek the acquaintance of young\r\nAlexander Braun, an ardent student, and an especial lover of\r\nbotany. At Tiedemann's lecture the next day Agassiz's attention was\r\nattracted by a young man who sat next him, and who was taking very\r\ncareful notes and illustrating them. There was something very\r\nwinning in his calm, gentle face, full of benevolence and\r\nintelligence. Convinced by his manner of listening to the lecture\r\nand transcribing it that this was the student of whom Tiedemann had\r\nspoken, Agassiz turned to his neighbor as they both rose at the\r\nclose of the hour, and said, \"Are you Alex Braun?\" \"Yes, and you,\r\nLouis Agassiz?\" It seems that Professor Tiedemann, who must have\r\nhad a quick eye for affinities in the moral as well as in the\r\nphysical world, had said to Braun also, that he advised him to make\r\nthe acquaintance of a young Swiss naturalist who had just come, and\r\nwho seemed full of enthusiasm for his work. The two young men left\r\nthe lecture-room together, and from that time their studies, their\r\nexcursions, their amusements, were undertaken and pursued in each\r\nother's company. In their long rambles, while they collected\r\nspecimens in their different departments of Natural History, Braun\r\nlearned zoology from Agassiz, and he, in his turn, learned botany\r\nfrom Braun. This was, perhaps, the reason why Alexander Braun,\r\nafterward Director of the Botanical Gardens in Berlin, knew more of\r\nzoology than other botanists, while Agassiz himself combined an\r\nextensive knowledge of botany with his study of the animal kingdom.\r\nThat the attraction was mutual may be seen by the following extract\r\nfrom a letter of Alexander Braun to his father.\r\n\r\nBRAUN To HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, May 12, 1826.\r\n\r\n. . .In my leisure hours, between the forenoon and afternoon\r\nlectures, I go to the dissecting-room, where, in company with\r\nanother young naturalist who has appeared like a rare comet on the\r\nHeidelberg horizon, I dissect all manner of beasts, such as dogs,\r\ncats, birds, fishes, and even smaller fry, snails, butterflies,\r\ncaterpillars, worms, and the like. Beside this, we always have from\r\nTiedemann the very best books for reference and comparison, for he\r\nhas a fine library, especially rich in anatomical works, and is\r\nparticularly friendly and obliging to us.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon from two to three I attend Geiger's lectures on\r\npharmaceutical chemistry, and from five to six those of Tiedemann\r\non comparative anatomy. In the interval, I sometimes go with this\r\nnaturalist, so recently arrived among us (his name is Agassiz, and\r\nhe is from Orbe), on a hunt after animals and plants. Not only do\r\nwe collect and learn to observe all manner of things, but we have\r\nalso an opportunity of exchanging our views on scientific matters\r\nin general. I learn a great deal from him, for he is much more at\r\nhome in zoology than I am. He is familiar with almost all the known\r\nmammalia, recognizes the birds from far off by their song, and can\r\ngive a name to every fish in the water. In the morning we often\r\nstroll together through the fish market, where he explains to me\r\nall the different species. He is going to teach me how to stuff\r\nfishes, and then we intend to make a collection of all the native\r\nkinds. Many other useful things he knows; speaks German and French\r\nequally well, English and Italian fairly, so that I have already\r\nappointed him to be my interpreter on some future vacation trip to\r\nItaly. He is well acquainted with ancient languages also, and\r\nstudies medicine besides. . .\r\n\r\nA few lines from Braun to his mother, several weeks later, show\r\nthat this first enthusiasm, poured out with half-laughing\r\nextravagance to his father, was ripening into friendship of a more\r\nserious character.\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, June 1, 1826.\r\n\r\n. . .I am very happy now that I have found some one whose\r\noccupations are the same as mine. Before Agassiz came I was obliged\r\nto make my excursions almost always alone, and to study in\r\nhermit-like isolation. After all, two people working together can\r\naccomplish far more than either one can do alone. In order, for\r\ninstance, to utilize the interval spent in the time-consuming and\r\nmechanical work of preparing specimens, pinning insects and the\r\nlike, we have agreed that while one is so employed the other shall\r\nread aloud. In this way we shall go through various works on\r\nphysiology, anatomy, and zoology.\r\n\r\nNext to Alexander Braun, Agassiz's most congenial companion at\r\nHeidelberg was Karl Schimper, a friend of Braun, and like him a\r\nyoung botanist of brilliant promise. The three soon became\r\ninseparable. Agassiz had many friends and companions at the\r\nuniversity beside those who, on account of their influence upon his\r\nafter life, are mentioned here. He was too affectionate not to be a\r\ngenial companion among his young countrymen of whom there were many\r\nat Heidelberg, where they had a club and a gymnasium of their own.\r\nIn the latter, Agassiz bore his part in all the athletic sports,\r\nbeing distinguished both as a powerful gymnast and an expert\r\nfencer.\r\n\r\nOf the professors then at Heidelberg, Leuckart, the zoologist, was,\r\nperhaps, the most inspiriting. His lectures were full of original\r\nsuggestions and clever hypotheses, which excited and sometimes\r\namused his listeners. He knew how to take advantage of the\r\nenthusiasm of his brighter pupils, and, at their request, gave them\r\na separate course of instruction on special groups of animals; not\r\nwithout some personal sacrifice, for these extra lectures were\r\ngiven at seven o'clock in the morning, and the students were often\r\nobliged to pull their professor out of bed for the purpose. The\r\nfact that they did so shows at least the friendly relation existing\r\nbetween teacher and scholars. With Bischoff the botanist also, the\r\nyoung friends were admitted to the most kindly intercourse. Many a\r\npleasant botanical excursion they had with him, and they owed to\r\nhim a thorough and skillful instruction in the use of the\r\nmicroscope, handled by him like a master. Tiedemann's lectures were\r\nvery learned, and Agassiz always spoke of his old teacher in\r\ncomparative anatomy and physiology with affectionate respect and\r\nadmiration. He was not, however, an inspiring teacher, and though\r\nan excellent friend to the students, they had no such intimate\r\npersonal relations with him as with Leuckart and Bischoff. From\r\nBronn, the paleontologist, they received an immense amount of\r\nspecial information, but his instruction was minute in details\r\nrather than suggestive in ideas; and they were glad when their\r\nprofessor, finding that the course must be shortened for want of\r\ntime, displayed to them his magnificent collection of fossils, and\r\nwith the help of the specimens, developed his subject in a more\r\ngeneral and practical way.* (* This collection was purchased in\r\n1859 by the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, and Agassiz had thus the pleasure of teaching his\r\nAmerican pupils from the very collection in which he had himself\r\nmade his first important paleontological studies.) Of the medical\r\nprofessors, Nageli was the more interesting, though the reputation\r\nof Chelius brought him a larger audience. If there was however any\r\nlack of stimulus in the lecture rooms, the young friends made good\r\nthe deficiency by their own indefatigable and intelligent study of\r\nnature, seeking to satisfy their craving for knowledge by every\r\nmeans within their reach.* (* The material for this account of the\r\nstudent life of the two friends at Heidelberg and of their teachers\r\nwas chiefly furnished by Alexander Braun himself at the close of\r\nhis own life, after the death of Agassiz. The later sketches of the\r\nProfessors at Munich in 1832 were drawn in great part from the same\r\nsource.)\r\n\r\nAs the distance and expense made it impossible for Agassiz to spend\r\nhis vacations with his family in Switzerland, it soon became the\r\nhabit for him to pass the holidays with his new friend at\r\nCarlsruhe. For a young man of his tastes and acquirements a more\r\ncharming home-life than the one to which he was here introduced can\r\nhardly be imagined. The whole atmosphere was in harmony with the\r\npursuits of the students. The house was simple in its appointments,\r\nbut rich in books, music, and in all things stimulating to the\r\nthought and imagination. It stood near one of the city gates which\r\nopened into an extensive oak forest, in itself an admirable\r\ncollecting ground for the naturalist. At the back certain rooms,\r\nsheltered by the spacious garden from the noise of the street, were\r\ndevoted to science. In the first of these rooms the father's rich\r\ncollection of minerals was arranged, and beyond this were the\r\nlaboratories of his sons and their friends, where specimens of all\r\nsorts, dried and living plants, microscopes and books of reference,\r\ncovered the working tables. Here they brought their treasures; here\r\nthey drew, studied, dissected, arranged their specimens; here they\r\ndiscussed the theories, with which their young brains were teeming,\r\nabout the growth, structure, and relations of animals and plants.*\r\n(* See \"Biographical Memoir of Louis Agassiz\" by Arnold Guyuot, in\r\nthe \"Proceedings of U.S. National Academy\".)\r\n\r\nFrom this house, which became a second home to Agassiz, he wrote to\r\nhis father in the Christmas holidays of 1826:. . .\"My happiness\r\nwould be perfect were it not for the painful thought which pursues\r\nme everywhere, that I live on your privations; yet it is impossible\r\nfor me to diminish my expenses farther. You would lift a great\r\nweight from my heart if you could relieve yourself of this burden\r\nby an arrangement with my uncle at Neuchatel. I am confident that\r\nwhen I have finished my studies I could easily make enough to repay\r\nhim. At all events, I know that you cannot pay the whole at once,\r\nand therefore in telling me frankly what are our resources for this\r\nobject you would do me the greatest favor. Until I know that, I\r\ncannot be at peace. Otherwise, I am well, going on as usual, always\r\nworking as hard as I can, and I believe all the professors whose\r\nlectures I attend are satisfied with me.\". . .His father was also\r\npleased with his conduct and with his progress, for about this time\r\nhe writes to a friend, \"We have the best possible news of Louis.\r\nCourageous, industrious, and discreet, he pursues honorably and\r\nvigorously his aim, namely, the degree of Doctor of Medicine and\r\nSurgery.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1827 Agassiz fell ill of a typhus fever prevalent\r\nat the university as an epidemic. His life was in danger for many\r\ndays. As soon as he could be moved, Braun took him to Carlsruhe,\r\nwhere his convalescence was carefully watched over by his friend's\r\nmother. Being still delicate he was advised to recruit in his\r\nnative air, and he returned to Orbe, accompanied by Braun, who did\r\nnot leave him till he had placed him in safety with his parents.\r\nThe following extracts from the correspondence between himself and\r\nBraun give some account of this interval spent at home.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO BRAUN.\r\n\r\nORBE, May 26, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .Since I have been here, I have walked faithfully and have\r\ncollected a good number of plants which are not yet dry. I have\r\nmore than one hundred kinds, about twenty specimens of each. As\r\nsoon as they can be taken out of the press, I'll send you a few\r\nspecimens of each kind with a number attached so that you may\r\nidentify them. Take care that you do not displace the numbers in\r\nopening the package. Should you want more of any particular kind\r\nlet me know; also whether Schimper wishes for any. . .At Neuchatel\r\nI had the good fortune to find at least thirty specimens of\r\nBombinator obstetricans with the eggs. Tell Dr. Leuckart that I\r\nwill bring him some,--and some for you also. I kept several alive\r\nlaid in damp moss; after fourteen days the eggs were almost as\r\nlarge as peas, and the little tadpoles moved about inside in all\r\ndirections. The mother stripped the eggs from her legs, and one of\r\nthe little tadpoles came out, but died for want of water. Then I\r\nplaced the whole mass of eggs in a vessel filled with water, and\r\nbehold! in about an hour some twenty young ones were swimming\r\nfreely about. I shall spare no pains to raise them, and I hope, if\r\nI begin aright, to make fine toads of them in the end. My oldest\r\nsister is busy every day in making drawings for me to illustrate\r\ntheir gradual development. . .I dissect now as much and on as great\r\na variety of subjects as possible. This makes my principal\r\noccupation. I am often busy too with Oken. His \"Natur-philosophie\"\r\ngives me the greatest pleasure. I long for my box, being in need of\r\nmy books, which, no doubt, you have sent. Meantime, I am reading\r\nsomething of Universal History, and am not idle, as you see. But I\r\nmiss the evenings with you and Schimper at Heidelberg, and wish I\r\nwere with you once more. I am afraid when that happy time does\r\ncome, it will be only too short. . .\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, May, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .On Thursday evening, the 10th, I reached Heidelberg. The\r\nmedical lectures did not begin till the second week of May, so that\r\nI have missed little, and almost regret having returned so soon. . .\r\nI passed the last afternoon in Basel very pleasantly with Herr\r\nRoepper, to whom I must soon write. He gave me a variety of\r\nspecimens, showed me many beautiful things, and told me much that\r\nwas instructive. He is a genuine and excellent botanist, and no\r\nmere collector like the majority. Neither is he purely an observer\r\nlike Dr. Bischoff, but a man who thinks. . .Dr. Leuckart is in\r\nraptures about the eggs of the \"Hebammen Krote,\" and will raise\r\nthem. . .Schweiz takes your place in our erudite evening meetings.\r\nI have been lecturing lately on the metamorphosis of plants, and\r\nSchimper has propounded an entirely new and very interesting\r\ntheory, which will, no doubt, find favor with you hereafter, about\r\nthe significance of the circular and longitudinal fibres in\r\norganisms. Schimper is fruitful as ever in poetical and\r\nphilosophical ideas, and has just now ventured upon a natural\r\nhistory of the mind. We have introduced mathematics also, and he\r\nhas advanced a new hypothesis about comets and their long tails. . .\r\nOur chief botanical occupation this summer is the careful\r\nobservation of all our plants, even the commonest, and the\r\nexplanation of whatever is unusual or enigmatical in their\r\nstructure. We have already cracked several such nuts, but many\r\nremain to be opened. All such puzzling specimens are spread on\r\nsingle sheets and set aside. . .But more of this when we are\r\ntogether again. . .Dr. Leuckart begs you to study carefully the\r\n\"Hebammen Unke;\"* (* Bombinator obstetricans referred to in a\r\nformer letter.) to notice whether the eggs are already fecundated\r\nwhen they are in the earth, or whether they copulate later in the\r\nwater, or whether the young are hatched on land, and what is their\r\ntadpole condition, etc. All this is still unknown. . .\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO BRAUN.\r\n\r\nORBE, June 10, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .Last week I made a very pleasant excursion. You will remember\r\nthat I have often spoken to you of Pastor Mellet at Vallorbe, who\r\nis much interested in the study of the six-legged insects. He\r\ninvited me to go to Vallorbe with him for some days, and I passed a\r\nweek there, spending my time most agreeably. We went daily on a\r\nsearch after insects; the booty was especially rich in beetles and\r\nbutterflies. . .I examined also M. Mellet's own most excellent\r\ncollection of beetles and butterflies very carefully. He has many\r\nbeautiful things, but almost exclusively Swiss or French, with a\r\nfew from Brazil,--in all about 3,000 species. He gave me several,\r\nand promises more in the autumn. . .He knows his beetles\r\nthoroughly, and observes their habits, haunts, and changes (as far\r\nas he can) admirably well. It is a pity though that while his\r\nknowledge of species is so accurate, he knows nothing of\r\ndistribution, classification, or general relations. I tried to\r\nconvince him that he ought to collect snails, slugs, and other\r\nobjects of natural history, in the hope that he might gain thereby\r\na wider insight. But he would not listen to it; he said he had\r\nenough to do with his Vermine.\r\n\r\nMy brother writes me that my box has arrived in Neuchatel. As I am\r\ngoing there soon I will take it then. I rejoice in the thought of\r\nbeing in Neuchatel, partly on account of my brother, Arnold\r\n(Guyot), and other friends, and partly that I may study the fishes\r\nof our Swiss lakes. The species Cyprinus and Corregonus with their\r\nallies, including Salmo, are, as you know, especially difficult. I\r\nwill preserve some small specimens in alcohol, and, if possible,\r\ndissect one of each, in order to satisfy myself as to their\r\nidentity or specific variety. As the same kinds have received\r\ndifferent names in different lakes, and since even differences of\r\nage have led to distinct designations, I will note all this down\r\ncarefully. When I have made it clear to myself, I will send you a\r\ncatalogue of the kinds we possess, specifying at the same time the\r\nlakes in which they occur. As I am on the chapter of fishes, I will\r\nask you:\r\n\r\n1. What are the gill arches?\r\n2. What the gill blades?\r\n3. What is the bladder in fishes?\r\n4. What is the cloaca in the egg-laying animals?\r\n5. What signify the many fins of fishes?\r\n6. What is the sac which surrounds the eggs in Bombinator obstetricans?\r\n\r\n. . .Tell Dr. Leuckart I have already put aside for him the\r\nCorregonus umbla (if such it be), but can get no Silurus glanis.\r\n\r\nI suppose you continue to come together now and then in the evening\r\n. . .Make me a sharer in your new discoveries. Have you finished\r\nyour essay on the physiology of plants, and what do you make of\r\nit?. . .\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nCARLSRUHE, Whitsuntide, Monday, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .I am in Carlsruhe, and as the package has not gone yet, I add\r\na note. I have been analyzing and comparing all sorts of plants in\r\nour garden to-day, and I wish you had been with me. On my last\r\nsheet I send some nuts for you to pick, some wholly, some half,\r\nothers not at all, cracked. Schimper is lost in the great\r\nimpenetrable world of suns, with their planets, moons, and comets;\r\nhe soars even into the region of the double stars, the milky way,\r\nand the nebulae.\r\n\r\nOn a loose sheet come the \"nuts to pick.\" It contains a long list\r\nof mooted questions, a few of which are given here to show the\r\nexchange of thought between Agassiz and his friend, the one\r\npropounding zoological, the other botanical, puzzles. Although most\r\nof the problems were solved long ago, it is not uninteresting to\r\nfollow these young minds in their search after the laws of\r\nstructure and growth, dimly perceived at first, but becoming\r\ngradually clearer as they go on. The very first questions hint at\r\nthe law of Phyllotaxis, then wholly unknown, though now it makes a\r\npart of the most elementary instruction in botany.* (* Botany owes\r\nto Alexander Braun and Karl Schimper the discovery of this law, by\r\nwhich leaves, however crowded, are so arranged around the stem as\r\nto divide the space with mathematical precision, thus giving to\r\neach leaf its fair share of room for growth.)\r\n\r\n\"1. Where is the first diverging point of the stems and roots in\r\nplants, that is to say, the first geniculum?\r\n\r\n\"2. How do you explain the origin of those leaves on the stem\r\nwhich, not arising from distinct geniculi, are placed spirally or\r\nscattered around the stem?\r\n\r\n\"3. Why do some plants, especially trees (contrary to the ordinary\r\ncourse of development in plants), blossom before they have put\r\nforth leaves? (Elm-trees, willow-trees, and fruit-trees.)\r\n\r\n\"4. In what succession does the development of the organs of the\r\nflower take place?--and their formation in the bud? (Compare\r\nCampanula, Papaver.)\r\n\r\n\"5. What are the leaves of the Spergula?\r\n\r\n\"6. What are the tufted leaves of various pine-trees? (Pinus\r\nsylvestris, Strobus, Larix, etc.). . .\r\n\r\n\"8. What is individuality in plants?\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter contains Agassiz's answer to Dr. Leuckart's\r\nquestions concerning the eggs he had sent him, and some farther\r\naccount of his own observations upon them.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO BRAUN.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, June 20, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .Now you shall hear what I know of the \"Hebammen Krote.\" How\r\nthe fecundation takes place I know not, but it must needs be the\r\nsame as in other kinds of the related Bombinator; igneus throws out\r\nalmost as many eggs hanging together in clusters as obstetricans;\r\nfuscus throws them out from itself in strings (see Roseld's\r\nillustration). . .I have now carefully examined the egg clusters of\r\nobstetricans; all the eggs are in one string and hang together.\r\nThis string is a bag, in which the eggs lie inclosed at different\r\ndistances, though they seem in the empty space to be fallen,\r\nthread-like, together. But if you stretch the thread and press the\r\neggs, they change their places, and you can distinctly see that\r\nthey lie free in the bag, having their own membranous envelopes\r\ncorresponding to those of other batrachian eggs. Surely this\r\nspecies seeks the water at the time of fecundation, for so do all\r\nbatrachians, the water being indeed a more fitting medium for\r\nfecundation than the air. . .It is certain that the eggs were\r\nalready fecundated when we found them in the ground, for later, I\r\nfound several not so far advanced as those you have, and yet after\r\nthree weeks I had tadpoles from them. In those eggs which were in\r\nthe lowest stage of development (how they may be earlier, nescio),\r\nnothing was clearly visible; they were simply little yellow balls.\r\nAfter some days, two small dark spots were to be seen marking the\r\nposition of the eyes, and a longitudinal streak indicated the\r\ndorsal ridge. Presently everything became more distinct; the mouth\r\nand the nasal opening, the eyes and the tail, which lay in a half\r\ncircle around the body; the skin was so transparent that the\r\nbeating of the heart and the blood in the vessels could be easily\r\ndistinguished; the yolk and the yolk sac were meanwhile sensibly\r\ndiminished. The movements of the little animal were now quite\r\nperceptible,--they were quick and by starts. After three or four\r\nweeks the eggs were as large as peas; the bags had burst at the\r\nspots where the eggs were attached, and the little creatures filled\r\nthe egg envelopes completely. They moved incessantly and very\r\nquickly. Now the female stripped off the eggs from her legs; she\r\nseemed very uneasy, and sprang about constantly in the tank, but\r\ngrew more quiet when I threw in more water. The eggs were soon\r\nfree, and I laid them in a shallow vessel filled with fresh water.\r\nThe restlessness among them now became greater, and behold! like\r\nlightning, a little tadpole slipped out of its egg, paused\r\nastonished, gazed on the greatness of the world, made some\r\nphilanthropic observations, and swam quickly away. I gave them\r\nfresh water often, and tender green plants as well as bread to eat.\r\nThey ate eagerly. Up to this time their different stages of\r\ndevelopment had been carefully drawn by my sister. I now went to\r\nVallorbe; they promised at home to take care of my young brood, but\r\nwhen I returned the tadpoles had been forgotten, and I found them\r\nall dead; not yet decayed, however, and I could therefore preserve\r\nthem in alcohol. The gills I have never seen, but I will watch to\r\nsee whether they are turned inward. . .\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nCARLSRUHE, August 9, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .This is to tell you that I have determined to leave Heidelberg\r\nin the autumn and set forth on a pilgrimage to Munich, and that I\r\ninvite you to be my traveling companion. Judging by a\r\ncircumstantial letter from Dollinger, the instruction in the\r\nnatural sciences leaves nothing to be desired there. Add to this\r\nthat the lectures are free, and the theatre open to students at\r\ntwenty-four kreutzers. No lack of advantages and attractions,\r\nlodgings hardly more expensive than at Heidelberg, board equally\r\ncheap, beer plenty and good. Let all this persuade you. We shall\r\nhear Gruithuisen in popular astronomy, Schubert in general natural\r\nhistory, Martius in botany, Fuchs in mineralogy, Seiber in\r\nmathematics, Starke in physics, Oken in everything (he lectures in\r\nwinter on the philosophy of nature, natural history, and\r\nphysiology). The clinical instruction will be good. We shall soon\r\nbe friends with all the professors. The library contains whatever\r\nis best in botany and zoology, and the collections open to the\r\npublic are very rich. It is not known whether Schelling will\r\nlecture, but at all events certain of the courses will be of great\r\nadvantage. Then little vacation trips to the Salzburg and\r\nCarinthian Alps are easily made from there! Write soon whether you\r\nwill go and drink Bavarian beer and Schnapski with me, and write\r\nalso when we are to see you in Heidelberg and Carlsruhe. Remind me\r\nthen to tell you about the theory of the root and poles in plants.\r\nAs soon as I have your answer we will bespeak our lodgings from\r\nDollinger, who will attend to that for us. Shall we again house\r\ntogether in one room, or shall we have separate cells in one comb,\r\nnamely, under the same roof? The latter has its advantages for\r\ngrass-gatherers and stone-cutters like ourselves. . .Hammer away\r\nindustriously at all sorts of rocks. I have collected at Auerbach,\r\nWeinheim, Wiesloch, etc. But before all else, observe carefully and\r\noften the wonderful structure of plants, those lovely children of\r\nthe earth and sky. Ponder them with child-like mind, for children\r\nmarvel at the phenomena of nature, while grown people often think\r\nthemselves too wise to wonder, and yet they know little more than\r\nthe children. But the thoughtful student recognizes the truth of\r\nthe child's feeling, and with his knowledge of nature his wonder\r\ndoes but grow more and more. . .\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n1827-1828: AGE 20-21.\r\n\r\nArrival in Munich.\r\nLectures.\r\nRelations with the Professors.\r\nSchelling, Martius, Oken, Dollinger.\r\nRelations with Fellow-Students.\r\nThe Little Academy.\r\nPlans for Traveling.\r\nAdvice from his Parents.\r\nVacation Journey.\r\nTri-Centennial Durer Festival at Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nAgssiz accepted with delight his friend's proposition, and toward\r\nthe end of October, 1827, he and Braun left Carlsruhe together for\r\nthe University of Munich. His first letter to his brother is given\r\nin full, for though it contains crudities at which the writer\r\nhimself would have smiled in after life, it is interesting as\r\nshowing what was the knowledge possessed in those days by a clever,\r\nwell-informed student of natural history.\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER AUGUSTE.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 5, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .At last I am in Munich. I have so much to tell you that I\r\nhardly know where to begin. To be sure that I forget nothing,\r\nhowever, I will give things in their regular sequence. First, then,\r\nthe story of my journey; after that, I will tell you what I am\r\ndoing here. As papa has, of course, shown you my last letter, I\r\nwill continue where I left off. . .\r\n\r\nFrom Carlsruhe we traveled post to Stuttgart, where we passed the\r\ngreater part of the day in the Museum, in which I saw many things\r\nquite new to me; a llama, for instance, almost as large as an ass.\r\nYou know that this animal, which is of the genus Camelus, lives in\r\nSouth America, where it is to the natives what the camel is to the\r\nArab; that is to say, it provides them with milk, wool, and meat,\r\nand is used by them, moreover, for driving and riding. There was a\r\nNorth American buffalo of immense size; also an elephant from\r\nAfrica, and one from Asia; beside these, a prodigious number of\r\ngazelles, deer, cats, and dogs; skeletons of a hippopotamus and an\r\nelephant; and lastly the fossil bones of a mammoth. You know that\r\nthe mammoth is no longer found living, and that the remains\r\nhitherto discovered lead to the belief that it was a species of\r\ncarnivorous elephant. It is a singular fact that some fishermen,\r\ndigging recently on the borders of the Obi, in Siberia, found one\r\nof these animals frozen in a mass of ice, at a depth of sixty feet,\r\nso well preserved that it was still covered with hair, as in life.\r\nThey melted the ice to remove the animal, but the skeleton alone\r\nremained complete; the hide was spoiled by contact with the air,\r\nand only a few pieces have been kept, one of which is in the Museum\r\nat Stuttgart. The hairs upon it are as coarse as fine twine, and\r\nnearly a foot long. The entire skeleton is at St. Petersburg in the\r\nMuseum, and is larger than the largest elephant. One may judge by\r\nthat what havoc such an animal must have made, if it was, as its\r\nteeth show it to have been, carnivorous. But what I would like to\r\nknow is how this animal could wander so far north, and then in what\r\nmanner it died, to be frozen thus, and remain intact, without\r\ndecomposing, perhaps for countless ages. For it must have belonged\r\nto a former creation, since it is nowhere to be found living, and\r\nwe have no instance of the disappearance of any kind of animal\r\nwithin the historic period. There were, besides, many other kinds\r\nof fossil animals. The collection of birds is very beautiful, but\r\nit is a pity that many of them are wrongly named. I corrected a\r\nnumber myself. . .From Stuttgart we went to Esslingen, where we\r\nwere to visit two famous botanists. One was Herr Steudel; a sombre\r\nface, with long overhanging black hair, almost hiding the eyes,--a\r\nvery Jewish face. He knows every book on botany that appears, has\r\nread them all, but cares little to see the plants themselves; in\r\nshort, he is a true closet student. He has a large herbarium,\r\ncomposed in great part of plants purchased or received as gifts.\r\nThe other, Professor Hochstetter, is an odd little man, stepping\r\nbriskly about in his high boots, and having always a half\r\nsuppressed smile on his hips whenever he takes the pipe from\r\nbetween his teeth. A very good man, however, and extremely\r\nobliging; he offered us every civility. As we desired not only to\r\nmake their acquaintance, but to win from these botanists at least a\r\nfew grasses, we presented ourselves like true commis voyageurs,\r\nwith dried herbs to sell, each of us having a package of plants\r\nunder his arm,--mine being Swiss, gathered last summer, Braun's\r\nfrom the Palatinate. We gave specimens to each, and received in\r\nexchange from Steudel some American plants; from Hochstetter some\r\nfrom Bohemia, and others from Moravia, his native country. From\r\nEsslingen we were driven to Goeppingen, in the most frightful\r\nweather possible; it rained, snowed, froze, blew, all at once. It\r\nwas a pity, since our road lay through one of the prettiest valleys\r\nI have ever seen, watered by the Neckar, and bordered on both sides\r\nby mountains of singular form and of considerable height. They are\r\nwhat the Wurtembergers call the Suabian Alps, but I think that\r\nChaumont is higher than the loftiest peak of their Alps. Here we\r\nfound an old Heidelberg acquaintance, whose father owns a superb\r\ncollection of fossils, especially of shells and zoophytes. He has\r\nalso quite a large collection of shells from the Adriatic Sea, but\r\namong these last not one was named. As we knew them, we made it our\r\nduty to arrange them, and in three hours his whole collection was\r\nlabeled. Since he has duplicates of almost everything, he promised,\r\nas soon as he should have time, to make a selection from these and\r\nsend them to us. Could we have stayed longer we might have picked\r\nout what we pleased, for he placed his collection at our disposal.\r\nBut we were in haste to arrive here, so we begged him to send us,\r\nat his leisure, whatever he could give us.\r\n\r\nThence we continued our journey by post, because it still rained,\r\nand the roads were so detestable that with the best will in the\r\nworld we could not have made our way on foot. In the evening we\r\nreached Ulm, where, owing to the late hour, we saw almost nothing\r\nexcept the famous belfry of the cathedral, which was distinctly\r\nvisible as we entered the city. After supper we continued our\r\njourney, still by post, wishing to be in Munich the next day. I\r\nhave never seen anything more beautiful than the view as we left\r\nUlm. The moon had risen and shone upon the belfry like broad\r\ndaylight. On all sides extended a wide plain, unbroken by a single\r\ninequality, so far as the eye could distinguish, and cut by the\r\nDanube, glittering in the moonbeams. We crossed the plain during\r\nthe night, and reached Augsburg at dawn. It is a beautiful city,\r\nbut we merely stopped there for breakfast, and saw the streets only\r\nas we passed through them. On leaving Augsburg, the Tyrolean Alps,\r\nthough nearly forty leagues away, were in sight. About eighteen\r\nleagues off was also discernible an immense forest; of this we had\r\na nearer view as we advanced, for it encircles Munich at some\r\ndistance from the town. We arrived here on Sunday, the 4th, in the\r\nafternoon. . .My address is opposite the Sendlinger Thor Number 37.\r\nI have a very pretty chamber on the lower floor with an alcove for\r\nmy bed. The house is situated outside the town, on a promenade,\r\nwhich makes it very pleasant. Moreover, by walking less than a\r\nhundred yards, I reach the Hospital and the Anatomical School, a\r\ngreat convenience for me when the winter weather begins. One thing\r\ngives me great pleasure: from one of my windows the whole chain of\r\nthe Tyrolean Alps is visible as far as Appenzell; and as the\r\ncountry is flat to their very base, I see them better than we see\r\nour Alps from the plain. It is a great pleasure to have at least a\r\npart of our Swiss mountains always in sight. To enjoy it the more,\r\nI have placed my table opposite the window, so that every time I\r\nlift my head my eyes rest on our dear country. This does not\r\nprevent me from feeling dull sometimes, especially when I am alone,\r\nbut I hope this will pass off when my occupations become more\r\nregular. . .\r\n\r\nA far more stimulating intellectual life than that of Heidelberg\r\nawaited our students at Munich. Among their professors were some of\r\nthe most original men of the day,--men whose influence was felt all\r\nover Europe. Dollinger lectured on comparative anatomy and kindred\r\nsubjects; Martius and Zuccarini on botany. Martius gave, besides,\r\nhis so-called \"Reise-Colleg,\" in which he instructed the students\r\nhow to observe while on their travels. Schelling taught philosophy,\r\nthe titles of his courses in the first term being, \"Introduction to\r\nPhilosophy\" and \"The Ages of the World\"; in the second, \"The\r\nPhilosophy of Mythology\" and \"The Philosophy of Revelation.\"\r\nSchelling made a strong impression upon the friends. His manner was\r\nas persuasive as his style was clear, and his mode of developing\r\nhis subject led his hearers along with a subtle power which did not\r\npermit fatigue. Oken lectured on general natural history,\r\nphysiology, and zoology, including his famous views on the\r\nphilosophy of nature (Natur-philosophie). His lectures gave\r\noccasion for much scientific discussion, the more so as he brought\r\nvery startling hypotheses into his physiology, and drew from them\r\nconclusions which even upon his own showing were not always in\r\naccordance with experience. \"On philosophical grounds,\" he was wont\r\nto say, when facts and theory thus confronted each other, \"we must\r\nso accept it.\" Oken was extremely friendly with the students, and\r\nAgassiz, Braun, and Schimper (who joined them at Munich) passed an\r\nevening once a week at his house, where they listened to scientific\r\npapers or discussed scientific matters, over a pipe and a glass of\r\nbeer. They also met once a week to drink tea at the house of\r\nProfessor von Martius, where, in like manner, the conversation\r\nturned upon scientific subjects, unless something interesting in\r\ngeneral events gave it a different turn. Still more beloved was\r\nDollinger, whose character they greatly esteemed and admired while\r\nthey delighted in his instruction. Not only did they go to him\r\ndaily, but he also came often to see them, bringing botanical\r\nspecimens to Braun, or looking in upon Agassiz's breeding\r\nexperiments, in which he took the liveliest interest, being always\r\nready with advice or practical aid. The fact that Agassiz and Braun\r\nhad their room in his house made intercourse with him especially\r\neasy. This room became the rendezvous of all the aspiring, active\r\nspirits among the young naturalists at Munich, and was known by the\r\nname of \"The Little Academy.\" Schimper, no less than the other two,\r\ncontributed to the vivid, enthusiastic intellectual life, which\r\ncharacterized their meetings. Not so happy as Agassiz and Braun in\r\nhis later experience, the promise of his youth was equally\r\nbrilliant; and those who knew him in those early days remember his\r\ncharm of mind and manner with delight. The friends gave lectures in\r\nturn on various subjects, especially on modes of development in\r\nplants and animals. These lectures were attended not only by\r\nstudents, but often by the professors.\r\n\r\nAmong Agassiz's intimate friends in Munich, beside those already\r\nmentioned, was Michahelles, the distinguished young zoologist and\r\nphysician, whose early death in Greece, where he went to practice\r\nmedicine, was so much regretted. Like Agassiz, he was wont to turn\r\nhis room into a menagerie, where he kept turtles and other animals,\r\nbrought home, for the most part, from his journeys in Italy and\r\nelsewhere. Mahir, whose name occurs often in the letters of this\r\nperiod, was another college friend and fellow-student, though\r\nseemingly Agassiz's senior in standing, if not in years, for he\r\ngave him private instruction in mathematics, and also assisted him\r\nin his medical studies.\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER CECILE,\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 20, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .I will tell you in detail how my time is spent, so that when\r\nyou think of me you may know where I am and what I am doing. In the\r\nmorning from seven to nine I am at the Hospital. From nine to\r\neleven I go to the Library, where I usually work at that time\r\ninstead of going home. From eleven till one o'clock I have\r\nlectures, after which I dine, sometimes at one place, sometimes at\r\nanother, for here every one, that is, every foreigner, takes his\r\nmeals in the cafes, paying for the dinner on the spot, so that he\r\nis not obliged to go always to the same place. In the afternoon I\r\nhave other lectures on various subjects, according to the days,\r\nfrom two or three till five o'clock. These ended, I take a walk\r\nalthough it is then dark. The environs of Munich are covered with\r\nsnow, and the people have been going about in sleighs these three\r\nweeks. When I am frozen through I come home, and set to work to\r\nreview my lectures of the day, or I write and read till eight or\r\nnine o'clock. Then I go to my cafe for supper. After supper I am\r\nglad to return to the house and go to bed.\r\n\r\nThis is the course of my daily life, with the single exception that\r\nsometimes Braun and I pass an evening with some professor,\r\ndiscussing with all our might and main subjects of which we often\r\nknow nothing; this does not, however, lessen the animation of the\r\ntalk. More often, these gentlemen tell us of their travels, etc. I\r\nenjoy especially our visits to M. Martius, because he talks to us\r\nof his journey to Brazil, from which he returned some years ago,\r\nbringing magnificent collections, which he shows us whenever we\r\ncall upon him. Friday is market day here, and I never miss going to\r\nsee the fishes to increase my collection. I have already obtained\r\nseveral not to be found in Switzerland; and even in my short stay\r\nhere I have had the good fortune to discover a new species, of\r\nwhich I have made a very exact description, to be printed in some\r\njournal of natural history. Were my dear Cecile here, I should have\r\nbegged her to draw it nicely for me. That would have been pleasant\r\nindeed. Now I must ask a stranger to do it, and it will have by no\r\nmeans the same value in my eyes. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER AUGUSTE.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, December 26, 1827.\r\n\r\n. . .After my long fast from news of you, your letter made me very\r\nhappy. I was dull besides, and needed something to cheer me. . .\r\nSince my talk about natural history does not bore you, I want to\r\ntell you various other things about it, and also to ask you to do\r\nme a favor. I have stuffed a superb otter lately; next week I shall\r\nreceive a beaver, and I have exchanged all my little toads from\r\nNeuchatel for reptiles from Brazil and Java. One of our professors\r\nhere, who is publishing a natural history of reptiles, will\r\nintroduce in his work my description of that species, and my\r\nobservations upon it. He has already had lithographed those\r\ndrawings of eggs that Cecile made for me, as well as the colored\r\ndrawings made for me by Braun's sister when I was at Carlsruhe. My\r\ncollection of fishes is also much increased, but I have no\r\nduplicates left of the species I brought with me. I have exchanged\r\nthem all. I should therefore be greatly obliged if you would get me\r\nsome more of the same. I will tell you what kinds I want, and how\r\nyou are to forward them. I have still at Cudrefin several jars of\r\nthick green glass. When you go there take them away with you, fill\r\nthem with alcohol, and put into them as many of these fishes as you\r\ncan find for me. Put something between every two specimens, to\r\nprevent them from rubbing against each other; pack them in a little\r\nbox wrapped in hay, and send them either by a good opportunity or\r\nin the least expensive way. The kinds I want are [here follows the\r\nlist]. . .It will interest you to know that I am working with a\r\nyoung Dr. Born upon an anatomy and natural history of the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Europe. We have already gathered a great deal\r\nof material, and I think by the spring, or in the course of the\r\nsummer, we shall be able to publish the first number. This will\r\nbring in a little ready money for a short journey in the vacation.\r\n\r\nI earnestly advise you to while away your leisure hours with study.\r\nRead much, but only good and useful books. I promised to send you\r\nsomething; do not think, because I have not done so yet, that I\r\nhave forgotten it. On the contrary, the difficulty of choosing is\r\nthe cause of the delay; but I will make farther inquiry as to what\r\nwill suit you best and you shall have my list. Meantime remember to\r\nread Say, and if you have not already begun it, do not put it off.\r\nRemember that statistical and political knowledge alone\r\ndistinguishes the true merchant from the mere tradesman, and guides\r\nhim in his undertakings. . .A merchant familiar with the products\r\nof a country, its resources, its commercial and political relations\r\nwith other countries, is much less likely to enter into\r\nspeculations based on false ideas, and therefore of doubtful issue.\r\nWrite me about what you are reading and about your plans and\r\nprojects, for I can hardly believe that any one could exist without\r\nforming them: I, at least, could not.\r\n\r\nThe last line of this letter betrays the restless spirit of\r\nadventure growing out of the desire for larger fields of activity\r\nand research. Tranquilized for a while in the new and more\r\nsatisfying intellectual life of Munich, it stirred afresh from time\r\nto time, not without arousing anxiety in friends at home, as we\r\nshall see. The letter to which the following is an answer has not\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, January 8, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .Your letter reached me at Cudrefin, where I have been passing\r\nten days. With what pleasure I received it,--and yet I read it with\r\na certain sadness too, for there was something of ennui, I might\r\nsay of discontent, in the tone. . .Believe me, my dear Louis, your\r\nattitude is a wrong one; you see everything in shadow. Consider\r\nthat you are exactly in the position you have chosen for yourself;\r\nwe have in no way opposed your plans. We have, on the contrary,\r\nentered into them with readiness, saying amen to your proposals,\r\nonly insisting upon a profession that would make us easy about your\r\nfuture, persuaded as we are that you have too much energy and\r\nuprightness not to wish to fill honorably your place in society.\r\nYou left us a few months ago with the assurance that two years\r\nwould more than suffice to complete your medical studies. You chose\r\nthe university which offered, as you thought, the most ample means\r\nto reach your end; and now, how is it that you look forward only\r\nwith distaste to the practice of medicine? Have you reflected\r\nseriously before setting aside this profession? Indeed, we cannot\r\nconsent to such a step. You would lose ground in our opinion, in\r\nthat of your family, and in that of the public. You would pass for\r\nan inconsiderate, fickle young fellow, and the slightest stain on\r\nyour reputation would be a mortal blow to us. There is one way of\r\nreconciling all difficulties,--the only one in my opinion. Complete\r\nyour studies with all the zeal of which you are capable, and then,\r\nif you have still the same inclination, go on with your natural\r\nhistory; give yourself wholly up to it should that be your wish.\r\nHaving two strings to your bow, you will have the greater facility\r\nfor establishing yourself. Such is your father's way of thinking as\r\nwell as mine. . .Nor are you made to live alone, my child. In a\r\nhome only is true happiness to be found; there you can settle\r\nyourself to your liking. The sooner you have finished your studies,\r\nthe sooner you can put up your tent, catch your blue butterfly, and\r\nmetamorphose her into a loving housewife. Of course you will not\r\ngather roses without thorns; life consists of pains and pleasures\r\neverywhere. To do all the good you can to your fellow-beings, to\r\nhave a pure conscience, to gain an honorable livelihood, to procure\r\nfor yourself by work a little ease, to make those around you happy,\r\n--that is true happiness; all the rest but mere accessories and\r\nchimeras. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, February 3, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .You know well to whom you speak, dear mother, and how you must\r\nbait your hook in order that the fish may rise. When you paint it,\r\nI see nothing above domestic happiness, and am convinced that the\r\nheight of felicity is to be found in the bosom of your family,\r\nsurrounded by little marmots to love and caress you. I hope, too,\r\nto enjoy this happiness in time. . .But the man of letters should\r\nseek repose only when he has deserved it by his toil, for if once\r\nhe anchor himself, farewell to energy and liberty, by which alone\r\ngreat minds are fostered. Therefore I have said to myself, that I\r\nwould remain unmarried till my work should assure me a peaceful and\r\nhappy future. A young man has too much vigor to bear confinement so\r\nsoon; he gives up many pleasures which he might have had, and does\r\nnot appreciate at their just value those which he has. As it is\r\nsaid that the vaurien must precede the bon sujet, so I believe that\r\nfor the full enjoyment of sedentary life one must have played the\r\nvagabond for a while.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the subject of my last letter. It seems that you\r\nhave misunderstood me, for your answer grants me after all just\r\nwhat I ask. You think that I wish to renounce entirely the study of\r\nmedicine? On the contrary, the idea has never occurred to me, and,\r\naccording to my promise, you shall have one of these days a doctor\r\nof medicine as a son. What repels me is the thought of practicing\r\nmedicine for a livelihood, and here you give me free rein just\r\nwhere I wanted it. That is, you consent that I should devote myself\r\nwholly to the natural sciences should this career offer me, as I\r\nhope it may, a more favorable prospect. It requires, for instance,\r\nbut two or three years to go around the world at government\r\nexpense. I will levy contributions on all my senses that not a\r\nsingle chance may escape me for making interesting observations and\r\nfine collections, so that I also may be ranked among those who have\r\nenlarged the boundaries of science. With that my future is secured,\r\nand I shall return content and disposed to do all that you wish.\r\nEven then, if medicine had gained greater attraction for me, there\r\nwould still be time to begin the practice of it. It seems to me\r\nthere is nothing impracticable in this plan. I beg you to think of\r\nit, and to talk it over with papa and with my uncle at Lausanne\r\n. . .I am perfectly well and as happy as possible, for I feed in\r\nclover here on my favorite studies, with every facility at my\r\ncommand. If you thought my New Year's letter depressed, it was only\r\na momentary gloom due to the memories awakened by the day. . .\r\n\r\nFROM HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, February 21, 1828.\r\n\r\nYour mother's last letter, my dear Louis, was in answer to one from\r\nyou which crossed it on the way, and gave us, so far as your health\r\nand contentment are concerned, great satisfaction. Yet our\r\ngratification lacks something; it would be more complete had you\r\nnot a mania for rushing full gallop into the future. I have often\r\nreproved you for this, and you would fare better did you pay more\r\nattention to my reproof. If it be an incurable malady with you, at\r\nall events do not force your parents to share it. If it be\r\nabsolutely essential to your happiness that you should break the\r\nice of the two poles in order to find the hairs of a mammoth, or\r\nthat you should dry your shirt in the sun of the tropics, at least\r\nwait till your trunk is packed and your passports are signed before\r\nyou talk with us about it. Begin by reaching your first aim, a\r\nphysician's and surgeon's diploma. I will not for the present hear\r\nof anything else, and that is more than enough. Talk to us, then in\r\nyour letters, of your friends, of your personal life, of your wants\r\n(which I am always ready to satisfy), of your pleasures, of your\r\nfeeling for us, but do not put yourself out of our reach with your\r\nphilosophical syllogisms. My own philosophy is to fulfill my duties\r\nin my sphere, and even that gives me more than I can do. . .\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois \"Society of Public Utility\" has just announced an\r\naltogether new project, that of establishing popular libraries. A\r\ncommittee consisting of eight members, of whom I have the honor to\r\nbe one, is nominated under the presidency of M. Delessert for the\r\nexecution of this scheme. What do you think of the idea? To me it\r\nseems a delicate matter. I should say that before we insist upon\r\nmaking people read we must begin by preparing them to read\r\nusefully?. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, March 3, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .What you tell me of the \"Society of Public Utility\" has\r\naroused in me a throng of ideas, about which I will write you when\r\nthey are a little more mature. Meanwhile, please tell me: 1. What\r\nis this Society? 2. Of what persons is it composed? 3. What is its\r\nprincipal aim? 4. What are the popular libraries to contain, and\r\nfor what class are they intended? I believe this project may be of\r\nthe greatest service to our people, and it is on this account that\r\nI desire farther details that I may think it over carefully. Tell\r\nme, also, in what way you propose to distribute your libraries at\r\nsmall expense, and how large they are to be. . .\r\n\r\nI could not be more satisfied than I am with my stay here. I lead a\r\nmonotonous but an exceedingly pleasant life, withdrawn from the\r\ncrowd of students and seeing them but little. When our lectures are\r\nover we meet in the evening at Braun's room or mine, with three or\r\nfour intimate acquaintances, and talk of scientific matters, each\r\none in his turn presenting a subject which is first developed by\r\nhim, and then discussed by all. These exercises are very\r\ninstructive. As my share, I have begun to give a course of natural\r\nhistory, or rather of pure zoology. Braun talks to us of botany,\r\nand another of our company, Mahir, who is an excellent fellow,\r\nteaches us mathematics and physics in his turn. In two months our\r\nfriend Schimper, whom we left at Heidelberg, will join us, and he\r\nwill then be our professor of philosophy. Thus we shall form a\r\nlittle university, instructing each other and at the same time\r\nlearning what we teach more thoroughly, because we shall be obliged\r\nto demonstrate it. Each session lasts two or three hours, during\r\nwhich the professor in charge retails his merchandise without aid\r\nof notes or book. You can imagine how useful this must be in\r\npreparing us to speak in public and with coherence; the experience\r\nis the more important, since we all desire nothing so much as\r\nsooner or later to become professors in very truth, after having\r\nplayed at professor in the university.\r\n\r\nThis brings me naturally to my projects again. Your letter made me\r\nfeel so keenly the anxiety I had caused you by my passion for\r\ntravel, that I will not recur to it; but as my object was to make\r\nin that way a name that would win for me a professorship, I venture\r\nupon another proposition. If during the course of my studies I\r\nsucceed in making myself known by a work of distinction, will you\r\nnot then consent that I shall study, at least during one year, the\r\nnatural sciences alone, and then accept a professorship of natural\r\nhistory, with the understanding that in the first place, and in the\r\ntime agreed upon, I shall take my Doctor's degree? This is, indeed,\r\nessential to my obtaining what I wish, at least in Germany. You\r\nwill object that, before thinking of anything beyond, I ought first\r\nto fulfill the condition. But let me say that the more clearly a\r\nman sees the road before him, the less likely he is to lose his way\r\nor take the wrong turn,--the better he can divide his stages and\r\nhis resting-places. . .\r\n\r\nFROM HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, March 25, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .I have had a long talk about you with your uncle. He does not\r\nat all disapprove of your letters, of which I told him the\r\ncontents. He only insists, as we do, on the necessity of a settled\r\nprofession as absolutely essential to your financial position.\r\nIndeed, the natural sciences, however sublime and attractive, offer\r\nnothing certain in the future. They may, no doubt, be your golden\r\nbridge, or you may, thanks to them, soar very high, but--modern\r\nIcarus--may not also some adverse fortune, an unexpected loss of\r\npopularity, or, perhaps, some revolution fatal to your philosophy,\r\nbring you down with a somersault, and then you would not be sorry\r\nto find in your quiver the means of gaining your bread. Agreed that\r\nyou have now an invincible repugnance to the practice of medicine,\r\nit is evident from your last two letters that you would have no\r\nless objection to any other profession by which money is to be\r\nmade, and, besides, it is too late to make another selection. This\r\nbeing so, we will come to an understanding in one word: Let the\r\nsciences be the balloon in which you prepare to travel through\r\nhigher regions, but let medicine and surgery be your parachutes. I\r\nthink, my dear Louis, you cannot object to this way of looking at\r\nthe question and deciding it. In making my respects to the\r\nprofessor of zoology, I have the pleasure to tell him that his\r\nuncle was delighted with his way of passing his evenings, and\r\ncongratulates him with all his heart on his choice of a recreation.\r\nEnough of this chapter. I close it here, wishing you most heartily\r\ncourage, health, success, and, above all, contentment. . .\r\n\r\nUpon this follows the answer to Louis's request for details about\r\nthe \"Society of Public Utility.\" It shows the intimate exchange of\r\nthought between father and son on educational subjects, but it is\r\nof too local an interest for reproduction here.\r\n\r\nThe Easter vacation was devoted to a short journey, some account of\r\nwhich will be found in the next letter. The traveling party\r\nconsisted of Agassiz, Braun, and Schimper, with two other students,\r\nwho did not, however, remain with them during the whole trip.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, May 15, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .Pleasant as my Easter journey was, I will give you but a brief\r\naccount of it, for my enjoyment was so connected with my special\r\nstudies that the details would only be tiresome to you. You know\r\nwho were my traveling companions, so I have only to tell you of our\r\nadventures, assuredly not those of knights errant or troubadours.\r\nCould these gentry have been resuscitated, and have seen us\r\nstarting forth in blouses, with bags or botanical boxes at our\r\nbacks and butterfly-nets in our hands, instead of lance and\r\nbuckler, they could hardly have failed to look down upon us with\r\npity from the height of their grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe first day brought us to Landshut, where was formerly the\r\nuniversity till it was transferred, ten years ago, to Munich. We\r\nhad the pleasure of finding along our road most of the early spring\r\nplants. The weather was magnificent, and nature seemed to smile\r\nupon her votaries. . .We stopped on the way but one day, at\r\nRatisbon, to visit some relations of Braun's, with whom we promised\r\nto spend several days on our return. Learning on our arrival at\r\nNuremberg that the Durer festival, which had been our chief\r\ninducement for this journey, would not take place under eight or\r\nten days, we decided to pass the intervening time at Erlangen, the\r\nseat, as you know, of a university. I do not know if I have already\r\ntold you that among German students the exercise of hospitality\r\ntoward those who exchange visits from one university to another is\r\na sacred custom. It gives offense, or is at least looked upon as a\r\nmark of pride and disdain, if you do not avail yourself of this. We\r\ntherefore went to one of the cafe's de reunion, and received at\r\nonce our tickets for lodgings. We passed six days at Erlangen most\r\nagreeably, making a botanical excursion every day. We also called\r\nupon the professors of botany and zoology, whom we had already seen\r\nat Munich, and by whom we were most cordially received. The\r\nprofessor of botany, M. Koch, invited us to a very excellent\r\ndinner, and gave us many rare plants not in our possession before,\r\nwhile M. Wagner was kind enough to show us in detail the Museum and\r\nthe Library.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day appointed for the third centennial festival of\r\nDurer. Everything was so arranged as to make it very brilliant, and\r\nthe weather was most favorable. I doubt if ever before were\r\ncollected so many painters in the same place. They gathered; as if\r\nto vie with each other, from all nations, Russians, Italians,\r\nFrench, Germans, etc. Beside the pupils of the Academy of Fine Arts\r\nat Munich, I think that every soul who could paint, were it only\r\nthe smallest sketch, was there to pay homage to the great master.\r\nAll went in procession to the place where the monument is to be\r\nraised, and the magistrates of the city laid the first stones of\r\nthe pedestal. To my amusement they cemented these first stones with\r\na mortar which was served in great silver platters, and made of\r\nfine pounded porcelain mixed with champagne. In the evening all the\r\nstreets were illuminated; there were balls, concerts, and plays, so\r\nthat we must have been doubled or quadrupled to see everything. We\r\nstayed some days longer at Nuremberg to visit the other curiosities\r\nof the city, especially its beautiful churches, its manufactories,\r\netc., and then started on our return to Ratisbon. . .\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n1828-1829: AGE 21-22.\r\n\r\nFirst Important Work in Natural History.\r\nSpix's Brazilian Fishes.\r\nSecond Vacation Trip.\r\nSketch of Work during University Year.\r\nExtracts from the Journal of Mr. Dinkel.\r\nHome Letters.\r\nHope of joining Humboldt's Asiatic Expedition.\r\nDiploma of Philosophy.\r\nCompletion of First Part of the Spix Fishes.\r\nLetter concerning it from Cuvier.\r\n\r\nIt was not without a definite purpose that Agassiz had written to\r\nhis father some weeks before, \"Should I during the course of my\r\nstudies succeed in making myself known by a distinguished work,\r\nwould you not then consent that I should study for one year the\r\nnatural sciences alone?\" Unknown to his parents, for whom he hoped\r\nto prepare a delightful surprise, Agassiz had actually been engaged\r\nfor months on the first work which gave him distinction in the\r\nscientific world; namely, a description of the Brazilian fishes\r\nbrought home by Martius and Spix from their celebrated journey in\r\nBrazil. This was the secret to which allusion is made in the next\r\nletter. To his disappointment an accident brought his undertaking\r\nto the knowledge of his father and mother before it was completed.\r\nHe always had a boyish regret that his little plot had been\r\nbetrayed before the moment for the denouement arrived. The book was\r\nwritten in Latin and dedicated to Cuvier.* (* \"Selecta genera et\r\nspecies piscium quos collegit et pingendos curavit Dr. J.W. de\r\nSpix\". Digessit, descripsit et observationibus illustravit Dr. L.\r\nAgassiz.)\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, July 27, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .Various things which I have begun keep me a prisoner here.\r\nProbably I shall not stir during the vacation, and shall even give\r\nup the little trip in the Tyrol, which I had thought of making as a\r\nrest from occupations that bind me very closely at present, but\r\nfrom which I hope to free myself in the course of the holidays.\r\nDon't be angry with me for not telling you at once what they are.\r\nWhen you know, I hope to be forgiven for keeping you so long in the\r\ndark. I have kept it a secret from papa too, though in his last\r\nletter he asks me what is my especial work just now. A few months\r\nmore of patience, and I will give you a strict account of my time\r\nsince I came here, and then I am sure you will be satisfied with\r\nme. I only wish to guard against one thing: do not take it into\r\nyour head that I am about to don the fool's cap suddenly and\r\nsurprise you with a Doctor's degree; that would be going a little\r\ntoo fast, nor do I think of it yet. . .I want to remind you not to\r\nlet the summer pass without getting me fishes according to the list\r\nin my last letter, which I hope you have not mislaid. You would\r\ngive me great pleasure by sending them as soon as possible. Let me\r\ntell you why. M. Cuvier has announced the publication of a complete\r\nwork on all the known fishes, and in the prospectus he calls on\r\nsuch naturalists as occupy themselves with ichthyology to send him\r\nthe fishes of the country where they live; he mentions those who\r\nhave already sent him collections, and promises duplicates from the\r\nParis Museum to those who will send him more. He names the\r\ncountries also from which he has received contributions, and\r\nregrets that he has nothing from Bavaria. Now I possess several\r\nspecimens of all the native species, and have even discovered some\r\nten not hitherto known to occur here, beside one completely new to\r\nscience, which I have named Cyprinus uranoscopus on account of the\r\nposition of the eyes, placed on the top instead of the sides of the\r\nhead,--otherwise very like the gudgeon. I have therefore thought I\r\ncould not better launch myself in the scientific world than by\r\nsending Cuvier my fishes with the observations I have made on their\r\nnatural history. To these I should like to add such rare Swiss\r\nspecies as you can procure for me. So do not fail.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, August 25, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .I received in good time, and with infinite delight, your\r\npleasant letter of July 27th. Its mysteries have however been\r\nunveiled by Dr. Schinz, who came to the meeting of the Natural\r\nHistory Society in Lausanne, where he met papa and my uncle, to\r\nwhom he pronounced the most solemn eulogiums on their son and\r\nnephew, telling them at the same time what was chiefly occupying\r\nyou now. I congratulate you, my dear brother, but I confess that\r\namong us all I am the least surprised, for my presentiments about\r\nyou outrun all this, and I hope soon to see them realized. In all\r\nfrankness I can assure you that the stoutest antagonists of your\r\nnatural history schemes begin to come over to your side. Among them\r\nis my uncle here, who never speaks of you now but with enthusiasm.\r\nWhat more can be said? I gave him your letter to read, and since\r\nthen he has asked me a dozen times at least if I had not forgotten\r\nto forward the remittance you asked for, saying that I must not\r\ndelay it. The truth is, I have deferred writing till the last\r\nmoment, because I have not succeeded in getting your fishes, and\r\nhave always been hoping that I might be able to fulfill your\r\ncommission. I busied myself on your behalf with all the zeal and\r\nindustry of which I was capable, but quite in vain. The devil\r\nseemed to be in it. The season of Bondelles was over two months\r\nago, and there are none to be seen; as to trout, I don't believe\r\none has been eaten in the whole town for six weeks. I am forever at\r\nthe heels of the fishermen, promising them double and treble the\r\nvalue of the fish I want, but they all tell me they catch nothing\r\nexcept pike. I have been to Cudrefin for lampreys, but found\r\nnothing. Rodolphe* (* An experienced old boatman.) has been\r\npaddling in the brook every day without success. I went to Sauge,\r\n--no eels, no anything but perch and a few little cat-fish. Two\r\nmortal Sundays did I spend, rod in hand, trying to catch bream,\r\nchubs, etc. I did get a few, but they were not worth sending. Now\r\nit is all over for this year, and we may as well put on mourning\r\nfor them; but I promise you that as soon as the spring opens I will\r\ngo to work, and you shall have all you want. If, in spite of\r\neverything, your hopes are not realized, I shall be very sorry, but\r\nrest assured that it is not my fault. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER CECILE.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, October 29, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .I have never written you about what has engrossed me so\r\ndeeply; but since my secret is out, I ought not to keep silence\r\nlonger. That you may understand why I have entered upon such a work\r\nI will go back to its origin. In 1817 the King of Bavaria sent two\r\nnaturalists, M. Martius and M. Spix, on an exploring expedition to\r\nBrazil. Of M. Martius, with whom I always spend my Wednesday\r\nevenings, I have often spoken to you. In 1821 these gentlemen\r\nreturned to their country laden with new discoveries, which they\r\npublished in succession. M. Martius issued colored illustrations of\r\nall the unknown plants he had collected on his journey, while M.\r\nSpix brought out several folio volumes on the monkeys, birds, and\r\nreptiles of Brazil, the animals being drawn and colored, chiefly\r\nlife-size, by able artists. It had been his intention to give a\r\ncomplete natural history of Brazil, but to the sorrow of all\r\nnaturalists he died in 1826. M. Martius, desirous to see the\r\ncompletion of the work which his traveling companion had begun,\r\nengaged a professor from Erlangen to publish the shells, and these\r\nappeared last year. When I came to Munich there remained only the\r\nfishes and insects, and M. Martius, who had learned something about\r\nme from the professors to whom I was known, found me worthy to\r\ncontinue the work of Spix, and asked me to carry on the natural\r\nhistory of the fishes. I hesitated for a long time to accept this\r\nhonorable offer, fearing that the occupation might withdraw me too\r\nmuch from my studies; but, on the other hand, the opportunity for\r\nlaying the foundation of a reputation by a large undertaking seemed\r\ntoo favorable to be refused. The first volume is already finished,\r\nand the printing was begun some weeks ago. You can imagine the\r\npleasure I should have had in sending it to our dear father and\r\nmother before they had heard one word about it, or knew even of the\r\nproposition. But I hope the premature disclosure of my secret\r\n(indeed, to tell the truth, I had not imposed silence on M. Schinz,\r\nnot dreaming that he would see any one of the family) will not\r\ndiminish your pleasure in receiving the first work of your brother\r\nLouis, which I hope to send you at Easter. Already forty colored\r\nfolio plates are completed. Will it not seem strange when the\r\nlargest and finest book in papa's library is one written by his\r\nLouis? Will it not be as good as to see his prescription at the\r\napothecary's? It is true that this first effort will bring me in\r\nbut little; nothing at all, in fact, because M. de Martius has\r\nassumed all the expenses, and will, of course, receive the profits.\r\nMy share will be a few copies of the book, and these I shall give\r\nto the friends who have the first claim.\r\n\r\nTo his father Agassiz only writes of his work at this time: \"I have\r\nbeen very busy this summer, and I can tell you from a good source\r\n(I have it from one of the professors himself) that the professors\r\nwhose lectures I have attended have mentioned me more than once, as\r\none of the most assiduous and best informed students of the\r\nuniversity; saying also that I deserved distinction. I do not tell\r\nyou this from ostentation, but only that you may not think I lose\r\nmy time, even though I occupy myself chiefly with the natural\r\nsciences. I hope yet to prove to you that with a brevet of Doctor\r\nas a guarantee, Natural History may be a man's bread-winner as well\r\nas the delight of his life. . .\"\r\n\r\nIn September Agassiz allowed himself a short interruption of his\r\nwork. The next letter gives some account of this second vacation\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nTO HIS PARENTS.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, September 26, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .The instruction for the academic year closed at the end of\r\nAugust, and our professors had hardly completed their lectures when\r\nI began my Alpine excursion. Braun, impatient to leave Munich, had\r\nalready started the preceding day, promising to wait for me on the\r\nSalzburg road at the first spot which pleased him enough for a\r\nhalt. That I might not keep him waiting, I begged a friend to drive\r\nme a good day's journey, thinking to overtake Braun the first day\r\non the pleasant banks of the Lake of Chiem. My traveling companions\r\nwere the younger Schimper [Wilhelm], of whom I have spoken to you\r\n(and who made a botanical journey in the south of France and the\r\nPyrenees two years ago), and Mahir, who drove us, with whom I am\r\nvery intimate; he is a medical student, and also a very\r\nenthusiastic physicist. He gave me private lessons in mathematics\r\nall winter, and was a member of our philomathic meetings. Braun had\r\nnot set out alone either, and his two traveling companions were\r\nalso friends of ours. One was Trettenbacher, a medical student\r\ngreatly given to sophisms and logic, but allowing himself to be\r\nbeaten in argument with the utmost good nature, though always\r\nbelieving himself in the right; a thoroughly good fellow with all\r\nthat, and a great connoisseur of antiquities. The other was a young\r\nstudent, More, from the ci-devant department of Mt. Tonnerre, who\r\ndevotes himself entirely to the natural sciences, and has chosen\r\nthe career of traveling naturalist. You can easily imagine that\r\nthis attracts me to him, but as he is only a beginner I am, as it\r\nwere, his mentor.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of our departure the weather was magnificent.\r\nDriving briskly along we had various surmises as to where we should\r\nprobably meet our traveling companions, not doubting that, as we\r\nhoped to reach the Lake of Chiem the same day, We should come\r\nacross them the day following on one of its pretty islands. But in\r\nthe afternoon the weather changed, and we were forced to seek\r\nshelter from torrents of rain at Rosenheim, a charming town on the\r\nbanks of the Inn, where I saw for the first time this river of\r\nHelvetic origin. I saluted it as a countryman of mine, and wished I\r\ncould change its course and send it back laden with my greetings.\r\nThe next day Mahir drove us as far as the shore of the lake. There\r\nwe parted from him, and took a boat to the islands, where we were\r\nmuch disappointed not to find Braun and his companions. We thought\r\nthe bad weather of the day before (for here it had rained all day)\r\nmight have obliged them to make the circuit of the lake. However,\r\nin order to overtake them before reaching Salzburg, we kept our\r\nboatmen, and were rowed across to the opposite shore near\r\nGrabenstadt, where we arrived at ten o'clock in the evening. In the\r\nafternoon the weather had cleared a little, and the view was\r\nbeautiful as we pulled away from the islands and watched them fade\r\nin the twilight. I also gathered much interesting information about\r\nthe inhabitants of the waters of this lake. Among others, I was\r\nmuch pleased to find a cat-fish, taken in the lake by one of the\r\nisland fishermen, and also a kind of chub, not found in\r\nSwitzerland, and called by the fishermen here \"Our Lady's Fish,\"\r\nbecause it occurs only on the shore of an island where there is a\r\nconvent, the nuns of which esteem it a great delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe third day we reached Traunstein, where, although it was Sunday,\r\nthere was a great horse fair. We looked with interest at the gay\r\nTyroleans, with the cock-feathers in their pointed hats, singing\r\nand yodeling in the streets with their sweethearts on their arms.\r\nEvery now and then they let fall some sarcastic comment on our\r\naccoutrements, which were indeed laughable enough to these people,\r\nwho had never seen anything beyond their own chalets, and for whom\r\nan excursion from their mountains to a fair in the nearest town is\r\na journey. It was noon when we stopped at Traunstein, and from\r\nthere to Salzburg is but five leagues. Before reaching the\r\nfortress, however, you must pass the great custom-house on the\r\nBavarian frontier, and fearing we might be delayed there too long\r\nby the stupid Austrian officials, and thus be prevented from\r\nentering the city before the gates were closed, we resolved to wait\r\ntill the next morning and spend the night at Adelstaetten, a pretty\r\nvillage about a league from Salzburg, and the last Bavarian post.\r\nNight was falling as we approached a little wood which hid the\r\nvillage from us. There we asked a peasant how far we had still to\r\ngo, and when he had answered our question he told us, evidently\r\nwith kind intention, that we should find good company in the\r\nvillage, for a few hours earlier three journeymen laborers had\r\narrived there; and then he added that we should no doubt be glad to\r\nmeet comrades and have a gay evening with them. We were not\r\nastonished to be taken for workmen, since every one who travels\r\nhere on foot, with a knapsack on his back, is understood to belong\r\nto the laboring class. . .Arrived at the village, we were delighted\r\nto find that the three journeymen were our traveling companions.\r\nThey had come, like ourselves, from Traunstein, where we had missed\r\neach other in the crowd, and they were going likewise to sleep at\r\nAdelstaetten, to avoid the custom-house. Finally, on Monday, at ten\r\no'clock, we crossed the long bridge over the Saala, between the\r\nwhite coats with yellow trimmings on guard there. On the Bavarian\r\nfrontier we had hardly remembered that there was a custom-house,\r\nand the name of student sufficed to pass us without our showing any\r\npassports; here, on the contrary, it was another reason for the\r\nstrictest examination. \"Have you no forbidden books?\" was the first\r\nquestion. By good fortune, before crossing the bridge, I had\r\nadvised Trettenbach to hide his song-book in the lining of his\r\nboot. I am assured that had it been taken upon him he would not\r\nhave been allowed to pass. In ransacking Braun's bag, one of the\r\nofficials found a shell such as are gathered by the basketful on\r\nthe shores of the Lake of Neuchatel. His first impulse was to go to\r\nthe office and inquire whether we should not pay duty on this,\r\nsaying that it was no doubt for the fabrication of false pearls,\r\nand we probably had plenty more. We had all the difficulty in the\r\nworld to make him understand that not fifty steps from the\r\ncustom-house the shores of the river were strewn with them. . .\r\nAfter all this we had to empty our purses to show that we had money\r\nenough for our journey, and that we should not be forced to beg in\r\norder to get through. While we underwent this inquisition, another\r\nofficer made a tour of inspection around us, to observe our general\r\nbearing, etc. . .After having kept us thus on coals for two hours\r\nthey gave us back our passports, and we went our way. At one\r\no'clock we arrived at Salzburg as hungry as wolves, but at the gate\r\nwe had still to wait and give up our passports again in exchange\r\nfor receipts, in virtue of which we could obtain permits from the\r\npolice to remain in the city. From our inn, we sent a waiter to get\r\nthese permits, but he presently returned with the news that we must\r\ngo in person to take them; there was, however, no hurry; it would\r\ndo in three or four hours! We had no farther difficulty except that\r\nit was made a condition of our stay that we should not appear in\r\nstudent's dress. This dress, they said, was forbidden in Austria.\r\nThey begged More to have his hair cut, otherwise it would be\r\nshortened gratis, and also informed us that at our age it was not\r\nbecoming to dispense with cravats. Happily, I had two with me, and\r\nBraun tied his handkerchief around his neck. It astonished me,\r\nalso, to see that we were not entered on the list of strangers\r\npublished every evening. So it was also, as we found, with other\r\nstudents, though the persons who came with them by the same\r\nconveyance, even the children, were duly inscribed. It seems this\r\nis a precaution against any gathering of students. . .\r\n\r\nThe letter concludes in haste for the mail, and if the story of the\r\njourney was finished the final chapter has not been preserved. Some\r\nextracts from the home letters of Agassiz's friend Braun, which are\r\nin place here, throw light on their university life for the coming\r\nyear.* (* See \"Life of Alexander Braun\", by his daughter, Madame\r\nCecile Mettenius.)\r\n\r\nALEXANDER BRAUN TO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 18, 1828.\r\n\r\n. . .I will tell you how we have laid out our time for this term.\r\nOur human consciousness may be said to begin at half-past five\r\no'clock in the morning. The hour from six to seven is appointed for\r\nmathematics, namely, geometry and trigonometry. To this appointment\r\nwe are faithful, unless the professor oversleeps himself, or\r\nAgassiz happens to have grown to his bed, an event which sometimes\r\noccurs at the opening of the term. From seven to eight we do as we\r\nlike, including breakfast. Under Agassiz's new style of\r\nhousekeeping the coffee is made in a machine which is devoted\r\nduring the day to the soaking of all sorts of creatures for\r\nskeletons, and in the evening again to the brewing of our tea. At\r\neight o'clock comes the clinical lecture of Ringseis. As Ringseis\r\nis introducing an entirely new medical system this is not wholly\r\nwithout general physiological and philosophical interest. At ten\r\no'clock Stahl lectures, five times a week, on mechanics as\r\npreliminary to physics. These and also the succeeding lectures,\r\ngiven only twice a week on the special natural history of\r\namphibians by Wagler, we all attend together. From twelve to one\r\no'clock we have nothing settled as yet, but we mean to take the\r\nlectures of Dollinger, in single chapters, as, for instance, when\r\nhe comes to the organs of the senses. At one o'clock we go to\r\ndinner, for which we have at last found a comfortable and regular\r\nplace, at a private house, after having dined everywhere and\r\nanywhere, at prices from nine to twenty kreutzers. Here, for\r\nthirteen kreutzers* (* About nine cents of our money.) each, in\r\ncompany with a few others, mostly known to us, we are provided with\r\na good and neatly served meal. After dinner we go to Dr. Waltl,\r\nwith whom we study chemistry, using Gmelin's text-book, and are\r\nshown the most important experiments. Next week we are to begin\r\nentomology with Dr. Perty, from three to four, three times a week.\r\nFrom one to two o'clock on Saturday we have a lesson in\r\nexperimental physiology, plainly speaking, in animal dissection,\r\nfrom Dr. Oesterreicher, a young Docent, who has written on the\r\ncirculation of the blood. As Agassiz dissects a great many animals,\r\nespecially fishes, at the house, we are making rapid progress in\r\ncomparative anatomy. At four o'clock we go usually once a week to\r\nhear Oken on \"Natur-philosophie\" (a course we attended last term\r\nalso), but by that means we secure a good seat for Schelling's\r\nlecture immediately after. A man can hardly hear twice in his life\r\na course of lectures so powerful as those Schelling is now giving\r\non the philosophy of revelation. This will sound strangely to you,\r\nbecause, till now, men have not believed that revelation could be a\r\nsubject for philosophical treatment; to some it has seemed too\r\nsacred; to others too irrational. . .This lecture brings us to six\r\no'clock, when the public courses are at an end: we go home, and now\r\nbegin the private lectures. Sometimes Agassiz tries to beat French\r\nrules and constructions into our brains, or we have a lesson in\r\nanatomy, or I read general natural history aloud to William\r\nSchimper. By and by I shall review the natural history of grasses\r\nand ferns, two families of which I made a special study last\r\nsummer. Twice a week Karl Schimper lectures to us on the morphology\r\nof plants; a very interesting course on a subject but little known.\r\nHe has twelve listeners. Agassiz is also to give us lectures\r\noccasionally on Sundays upon the natural history of fishes. You see\r\nthere is enough to do. . .\r\n\r\nSomewhat before this, early in 1828, Agassiz had made the\r\nacquaintance of Mr. Joseph Dinkel, an artist. A day spent together\r\nin the country, in order that Mr. Dinkel might draw a brilliantly\r\ncolored trout from life, under the immediate direction of the young\r\nnaturalist, led to a relation which continued uninterruptedly for\r\nmany years. Mr. Dinkel afterward accompanied Agassiz, as his\r\nartist, on repeated journeys, being constantly employed in making\r\nillustrations for the \"Poissons Fossiles\" and the \"Poissons d'Eau\r\nDouce,\" as well as for his monographs and smaller papers. The two\r\nlarger works, the latter of which remained unfinished, were even\r\nnow in embryo. Not only was Mr. Dinkel at work upon the plates for\r\nthe Fresh-Water Fishes, but Mr. J.C. Weber, who was then engaged in\r\nmaking, under Agassiz's direction, the illustrations for the Spix\r\nFishes, was also giving his spare hours to the same objects. Mr.\r\nDinkel says of Agassiz's student life at this time:--* (* Extract\r\nfrom notes written out in English by Mr. Dinkel after the death of\r\nAgassiz and sent to me. The English, though a little foreign, is so\r\nexpressive that it would lose by any attempt to change it, and the\r\nwriter will excuse me for inserting his vivid sketch just as it\r\nstands.--E.C.A.)\r\n\r\n\"I soon found myself engaged four or five hours almost daily in\r\npainting for him fresh-water fishes from the life, while he was at\r\nmy side, sometimes writing out his descriptions, sometimes\r\ndirecting me. . .He never lost his temper, though often under great\r\ntrial; he remained self-possessed and did everything calmly, having\r\na friendly smile for every one and a helping hand for those who\r\nwere in need. He was at that time scarcely twenty years old, and\r\nwas already the most prominent among the students at Munich. They\r\nloved him, and had a high consideration for him. I had seen him at\r\nthe Swiss students' club several times, and had observed him among\r\nthe JOLLY students; he liked merry society, but he himself was in\r\ngeneral reserved and never noisy. He picked out the gifted and\r\nhighly-learned students, and would not waste his time in ordinary\r\nconversation. Often, when he saw a number of students going off on\r\nsome empty pleasure-trip, he said to me, 'There they go with the\r\nother fellows; their motto is, \"Ich gehe mit den andern.\" I will go\r\nmy own way, Mr. Dinkel,--and not alone: I will be a leader of\r\nothers.' In all his doings there was an ease and calm which was\r\nremarkable. His studio was a perfect German student's room. It was\r\nlarge, with several wide windows; the furniture consisted of a\r\ncouch and about half a dozen chairs, beside some tables for the use\r\nof his artists and himself. Dr. Alex Braun and Dr. Schimper lodged\r\nin the same house, and seemed to me to share his studio. Being\r\nbotanists, they, too, brought home what they collected in their\r\nexcursions, and all this found a place in the atelier, on the\r\ncouch, on the seats, on the floors. Books filled the chairs, one\r\nalone being left for the other artist, while I occupied a standing\r\ndesk with my drawing. No visitor could sit down, and sometimes\r\nthere was little room to stand or move about. The walls were white,\r\nand diagrams were drawn on them, to which, by and by, we artists\r\nadded skeletons and caricatures. In short, it was quite original. I\r\nwas some time there before I could discover the real names of his\r\nfriends: each had a nickname,--Molluscus, Cyprinus, Rhubarb, etc.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this glimpse into \"The Little Academy\" we return to the thread\r\nof the home letters, learning from the next one that Agassiz's\r\nprivate collections were assuming rather formidable proportions\r\nwhen considered as part of the household furniture. Brought\r\ntogether in various ways, partly by himself, partly in exchange for\r\nduplicates, partly as pay for arranging specimens in the Munich\r\nMuseum, they had already acquired, when compared with his small\r\nmeans, a considerable pecuniary value, and a far higher scientific\r\nimportance. They included fishes, some rare mammalia, reptiles,\r\nshells, birds, an herbarium of some three thousand species of\r\nplants collected by himself, and a small cabinet of minerals. After\r\nenumerating them in a letter to his parents he continues: \"You can\r\nimagine that all these things are in my way now that I cannot\r\nattend to them, and that for want of room and care they are piled\r\nup and in danger of spoiling. You see by my list that the whole\r\ncollection is valued at two hundred louis; and this is so low an\r\nestimate that even those who sell objects of natural history would\r\nnot hesitate to take them at that price. You will therefore easily\r\nunderstand how anxious I am to keep them intact. Can you not find\r\nme a place where they might be spread out? I have thought that\r\nperhaps my uncle in Neuchatel would have the kindness to let some\r\nlarge shelves be put up in the little upper room of his house in\r\nCudrefin, where, far from being an annoyance or causing any smell,\r\nmy collection, if placed in a case under glass, or disposed in some\r\nother suitable manner, would be an ornament. Be so kind as to\r\npropose it to him, and if he consents I will then tell you what I\r\nshall need for its arrangement. Remember that on this depends, in\r\ngreat part, the preservation of my specimens, and answer as soon as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz was now hurrying forward both his preparation for his\r\ndegree and the completion of his Brazilian Fishes, in the hope of\r\nat last fulfilling his longing for a journey of exploration. This\r\nhope is revealed in his next home letter. The letter is a long one,\r\nand the first half is omitted since it concerns only the\r\narrangements for his collections, the care to be taken of them,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, February 14, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .But now I must talk to you of more important things, not of\r\nwhat I possess, but of what I am to be. Let me first recall one or\r\ntwo points touched upon before in our correspondence, which should\r\nnow be fully discussed.\r\n\r\n1st. You remember that when I first left Switzerland I promised you\r\nto win the title of Doctor in two years, and to be prepared (after\r\nhaving completed my studies in Paris) to pass my examination before\r\nthe \"Conseil de Sante,\" and begin practice.\r\n\r\n2nd. You will not have forgotten either that you exacted this only\r\nthat I might have a profession, and that you promised, should I be\r\nable to make my way in the career of letters and natural history,\r\nyou would not oppose my wishes. I am indeed aware that in the\r\nlatter case you see but one obstacle, that of absence from my\r\ncountry and separation from all who are dear to me. But you know me\r\ntoo well to think that I would voluntarily impose upon myself such\r\nan exile. Let us see whether we cannot resolve these difficulties\r\nto our mutual satisfaction, and consider what is the surest road to\r\nthe end I have proposed to myself ever since I began my medical\r\nstudies. Weigh all my reasons, for in this my peace of mind and my\r\nfuture happiness are concerned. Examine my conduct with reference\r\nto what I propose in every light, that of son and Vaudois citizen\r\nincluded, and I feel sure you will concur in my views.\r\n\r\nHere is my aim and the means by which I propose to carry it out. I\r\nwish it may be said of Louis Agassiz that he was the first\r\nnaturalist of his time, a good citizen, and a good son, beloved of\r\nthose who knew him. I feel within myself the strength of a whole\r\ngeneration to work toward this end, and I will reach it if the\r\nmeans are not wanting. Let us see in what these means consist.\r\n[Here follows the summing up of his reasons for preferring a\r\nprofessorship of natural history to the practice of medicine, and\r\nhis intention of trying for a diploma as Doctor of Philosophy in\r\nGermany.] But how obtain a professorship, you will say,--that is\r\nthe important point? I answer, the first step is to make myself a\r\nEuropean name, and for that I am on the right road. In the first\r\nplace my work on the fishes of Brazil, just about to appear, will\r\nmake me favorably known. I am sure it will be kindly received; for\r\nat the General Assembly of German naturalists and medical men last\r\nSeptember, in Berlin, the part already finished and presented\r\nbefore the Assembly was praised in a manner for which I was quite\r\nunprepared. The professors also, to whom I was known, spoke of me\r\nthere in very favorable terms.\r\n\r\nIn the second place there are now preparing two expeditions of\r\nnatural history, one by M. de Humboldt, with whose reputation you\r\nare surely familiar,--the same who spent several years in exploring\r\nthe equatorial regions of South America, in company with M.\r\nBonpland. He has been for some years at Berlin, and is now about to\r\nstart on a journey to the Ural Mountains, the Caucasus, and the\r\nconfines of the Caspian Sea. Braun, Schimper, and I have been\r\nproposed to him as traveling companions by several of our\r\nprofessors; but the application may come too late, for M. de\r\nHumboldt decided upon this journey long ago, and has probably\r\nalready chosen the naturalists who are to accompany him. How happy\r\nI should be to join this expedition to a country the climate of\r\nwhich is by no means unhealthy, under the direction of a man so\r\ngenerally esteemed, to whom the Emperor of Russia has promised help\r\nand an escort at all times and under all circumstances. The second\r\nexpedition is to a country quite as salubrious, and which presents\r\nno dangers whatever for travelers,--South America. It will be under\r\nthe direction of M. Ackermann, known as a distinguished\r\nagriculturist and as Councilor of State to the Grand Duke of Baden.\r\nI should prefer to go with Humboldt; but if I am too late, I feel\r\nvery sure of being able to join the second expedition. So it\r\ndepends, you see, only on your consent. This journey is to last two\r\nyears, at the end of which time, happily at home once more, I can\r\nfollow with all desirable facilities the career I have chosen. If\r\nthere should be a place for me at Lausanne, which I should prefer\r\nto any other locality, I could devote my life to teaching my young\r\ncountrymen, awaken in them the taste for science and observation so\r\nmuch neglected among us, and thus be more useful to my canton than\r\nI could be as a practitioner. These projects may not succeed; but\r\nin the present state of things all the probabilities are favorable.\r\nTherefore, I beg you to consider it seriously, to consult my uncle\r\nin Lausanne, and to write me at once what you think. . .\r\n\r\nIn spite of the earnest desire for travel shown in this letter it\r\nwill be seen later how the restless aspirations of childhood,\r\nboyhood, and youth, which were, after all, only a latent love of\r\nresearch, crystallize into the concentrated purpose of the man who\r\ncould remain for months shut up in his study, leaving his\r\nmicroscope only to eat and sleep,--a life as sedentary as ever was\r\nlived by a closet student.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, February 23, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .It was not without deep emotion that we read your letter of\r\nthe 14th, and I easily understand that, anticipating its effect\r\nupon us all, you have deferred writing as long as possible. Yet you\r\nwere wrong in so doing; had we known your projects earlier we might\r\nhave forestalled for you the choice of M. de Humboldt, whose\r\nexpedition seems to us preferable, in every respect, to that of M.\r\nAckermann. The first embraces a wider field, and concerns the\r\nhistory of man rather than that of animals; the latter is confined\r\nto an excursion along the sea-board, where there would be, no\r\ndoubt, a rich harvest for science, but much less for philosophy.\r\nHowever that may be, your father and mother, while they grieve for\r\nthe day that will separate them from their oldest son, will offer\r\nno obstacles to his projects, but pray God to bless them. . .\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letter of about the same date from Alexander Braun to\r\nhis father tells us how the projects so ardently urged upon his\r\nparents by Agassiz, and so affectionately accepted by them, first\r\ntook form in the minds of the friends.\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, February 15, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .Last Thursday we were at Oken's. There was interesting talk on\r\nall sorts of subjects, bringing us gradually to the Ural and then\r\nto Humboldt's journey, and finally Oken asked if we would not like\r\nto go with Humboldt. To this we gave warm assent, and told him that\r\nif he could bring it about we would be ready to start at a day's\r\nnotice, and Agassiz added, eagerly, \"Yes,--and if there were any\r\nhope that he would take us, a word from you would have more weight\r\nthan anything.\" Oken's answer gave us but cold comfort;\r\nnevertheless, he promised to write at once to Humboldt in our\r\nbehalf. With this, we went home in great glee; it was very late and\r\na bright moonlight night. Agassiz rolled himself in the snow for\r\njoy, and we agreed that however little hope there might be of our\r\njoining the expedition, still the fact that Humboldt would hear of\r\nus in this way was worth something, even if it were only that we\r\nmight be able to say to him one of these days, \"We are the fellows\r\nwhose company you rejected.\"\r\n\r\nWith this hope the friends were obliged to content themselves, for\r\nafter a few weeks of alternate encouragement and despondency their\r\nbright vision faded. Oken fulfilled his promise and wrote to\r\nHumboldt, recommending them most warmly. Humboldt answered that his\r\nplans were conclusively settled, and that he had chosen the only\r\nassistants who were to accompany him,--Ehrenberg and Rose.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this frustrated plan is here given the rough\r\ndraft of a letter from Agassiz to Cuvier, written evidently at a\r\nsomewhat earlier date. Although a mere fragment, it is the\r\noutpouring of the same passionate desire for a purely scientific\r\nlife, and shows that the opportunity suggested by Humboldt's\r\njourney had only given a definite aim to projects already full\r\ngrown. From the contents it must have been written in 1828. After\r\nsome account of his early studies, which would be mere repetition\r\nhere, he goes on: \"Before finishing my letter, allow me to ask some\r\nadvice from you, whom I revere as a father, and whose works have\r\nbeen till now my only guide. Five years ago I was sent to the\r\nmedical school at Zurich. After the first few lectures there in\r\nanatomy and zoology I could think of nothing but skeletons. In a\r\nshort time I had learned to dissect, and had made for myself a\r\nsmall collection of skulls of animals from different classes. I\r\npassed two years in Zurich, studying whatever I could find in the\r\nMuseum, and dissecting all the animals I could procure. I even sent\r\nto Berlin at this time for a monkey in spirits of wine, that I\r\nmight compare the nervous system with that of man. I spent all the\r\nlittle means I had in order to see and learn as much as possible.\r\nThen I persuaded my father to let me go to Heidelberg, where for a\r\nyear I followed Tiedemann's courses in human anatomy. I passed\r\nalmost the whole winter in the anatomical laboratory. The following\r\nsummer I attended the lectures of Leuckart on zoology, and those of\r\nBronn on fossils. When at Zurich, the longing to travel some day as\r\na naturalist had taken possession of me, and at Heidelberg this\r\ndesire only increased. My frequent visits to the Museum at\r\nFrankfort, and what I heard there concerning M. Ruppell himself,\r\nstrengthened my purpose even more than all I had previously read. I\r\nwas, as it were, Ruppell's traveling companion: the activity, the\r\ndifficulties to be overcome, all were present to me as I looked\r\nupon the treasures he had brought together from the deserts of\r\nAfrica. The vision of difficulty thus vanquished, and of the inward\r\nsatisfaction arising from it, tended to give all my studies a\r\ndirection in keeping with my projects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt that to reach my aim more surely it was important to\r\ncomplete my medical studies, and for this I came to Munich eighteen\r\nmonths ago. Still I could not make up my mind to renounce the\r\nnatural sciences. I attended some of the pathological lectures, but\r\nI soon found that I was neglecting them; and yielding once more to\r\nmy inclination, I followed consecutively the lectures of Dollinger\r\non comparative anatomy, those of Oken on natural history, those of\r\nFuchs on mineralogy, as well as the courses of astronomy, physics,\r\nchemistry, and mathematics. I was confirmed in this withdrawal from\r\nmedical studies by the proposition of M. de Martius that I should\r\ndescribe the fishes brought back by Spix from Brazil, and to this I\r\nconsented the more gladly because ichthyology has always been a\r\nfavorite study with me. I have not, however, been able to give them\r\nall the care I could have wished, for M. de Martius, anxious to\r\ncomplete the publication of these works, has urged upon me a rapid\r\nexecution. I hope, nevertheless, that I have made no gross errors,\r\nand I am the less likely to have done so, because I had as my guide\r\nthe observations you had kindly made for him on the plates of Spix.\r\nSeveral of these plates were not very exact; they have been set\r\naside and new drawings made. I beg that you will judge this work\r\nwhen it reaches you with indulgence, as the first literary essay of\r\na young man. I hope to complete it in the course of the next\r\nsummer. I would beg you, in advance, to give me a paternal word of\r\nadvice as to the direction my studies should then take. Ought I to\r\ndevote myself to the study of medicine? I have no fortune, it is\r\ntrue; but I would gladly sacrifice my life if, by so doing, I could\r\nserve the cause of science. Though I have not even a presentiment\r\nof any means with which I may one day travel in distant countries,\r\nI have, nevertheless, prepared myself during the last three years\r\nas if I might be off at any minute. I have learned to skin all\r\nsorts of animals, even very large ones. I have made more than a\r\nhundred skeletons of quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and fishes; I\r\nhave tested all the various liquors for preserving such animals as\r\nshould not be skinned, and have thought of the means of supplying\r\nthe want in countries where the like preparations are not to be\r\nhad, in case of need. Finally, I have trained as traveling\r\ncompanion a young friend,* (* William Schimper, brother of Karl.)\r\nand awakened in him the same love of the natural sciences. He is an\r\nexcellent hunter, and at my instigation has been taking lessons in\r\ndrawing, so that he is now able to sketch from nature such objects\r\nas may be desirable. We often pass delightful moments in our\r\nimaginary travels through unknown countries, building thus our\r\ncastles in Spain. Pardon me if I talk to you of projects which at\r\nfirst sight seem puerile; only a fixed aim is needed to give them\r\nreality, and to you I come for counsel. My longing is so great that\r\nI feel the need of expressing it to some one who will understand\r\nme, and your sympathy would make me the happiest of mortals. I am\r\nso pursued by this thought of a scientific journey that it presents\r\nitself under a thousand forms, and all that I undertake looks\r\ntoward one end. I have for six months frequented a blacksmith's and\r\ncarpenter's shop, learning to handle hammer and axe, and I also\r\npractice arms, the bayonet and sabre exercise. I am strong and\r\nrobust, know how to swim, and do not fear forced marches. I have,\r\nwhen botanizing and geologizing, walked my twelve or fifteen\r\nleagues a day for eight days in succession, carrying on my back a\r\nheavy bag loaded with plants or minerals. In one word, I seem to\r\nmyself made to be a traveling naturalist. I only need to regulate\r\nthe impetuosity which carries me away. I beg you, then, to be my\r\nguide.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfinished letter closes abruptly, having neither signature nor\r\naddress. Perhaps the writer's courage failed him and it never was\r\nsent. An old letter (date 1827) from Cuvier to Martius, found among\r\nAgassiz's papers of this time, and containing the very notes on the\r\nSpix Fishes to which allusion is here made, leaves no doubt,\r\nhowever, that this appeal was intended for the great master who\r\nexercised so powerful an influence upon Agassiz throughout his\r\nwhole life.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1829 Agassiz took his diploma in the faculty of\r\nphilosophy. He did this with no idea of making it a substitute for\r\nhis medical degree, but partly in deference to Martius, who wished\r\nthe name of his young colleague to appear on the title-page of the\r\nBrazilian Fishes with the dignity of Doctor, and partly because he\r\nbelieved it would strengthen his chance of a future professorship.\r\nOf his experience on this occasion he gives some account in the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, May 22, 1829.\r\n\r\nAs it was necessary for me to go through with my examination at\r\nonce, and as the days for promotion here were already engaged two\r\nmonths in advance, I decided to pass it at Erlangen. That I might\r\nnot go alone, and also for the pleasure of their company, I\r\npersuaded Schimper and Michahelles to do the same. Braun wanted to\r\nbe of the party, but afterward decided to wait awhile. We made our\r\nrequest to the Faculty in a long Latin letter (because, you know,\r\namong savants it is the thing to speak and write the language you\r\nknow least), requesting permission to pass our examination in\r\nwriting, and to go to Erlangen only for the colloquium and\r\npromotion. They granted our request on condition of our promise\r\n(jurisjurandi loco polliciti sumus) to answer the questions\r\npropounded without help from any one and without consulting books.\r\nAmong other things I had to develop a natural system of zoology, to\r\nshow the relation between human history and natural history, to\r\ndetermine the true basis and limits of the philosophy of nature,\r\netc. As an inaugural dissertation, I presented some general and\r\nnovel considerations on the formation of the skeleton throughout\r\nthe animal kingdom, from the infusoria, mollusks, and insects to\r\nthe vertebrates, properly so called. The examiners were\r\nsufficiently satisfied with my answers to give me my degree the\r\n23rd or 24th of April, without waiting for the colloquium and\r\npromotion, writing to me that they were satisfied with my\r\nexamination, and therefore forwarded my diploma without regard to\r\nthe oral examination. . .The Dean of the Faculty, in inclosing it\r\nto me, added that he hoped before long to see me professor, and no\r\nless the ornament of my university in that position than I had\r\nhitherto been as student. I must try not to disappoint him. . .\r\n\r\nA letter from his brother contains a few lines in reference to\r\nthis. \"Last evening, dear Louis, your two diplomas reached me. I\r\ncongratulate you with all my heart on your success. I am going to\r\nsend to grandpapa the one destined for him, and I see in advance\r\nall his pleasure, though it would be greater if the word medicine\r\nstood for that of philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nThe first part of the work on the Brazilian Fishes was now\r\ncompleted, and he had the pleasure of sending it to his parents as\r\nhis own forerunner. After joining a scientific meeting to be held\r\nat Heidelberg, in September, he was to pass a month at home before\r\nreturning to Munich for the completion of his medical studies.\r\n\r\nTO HIS PARENTS.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, July 4, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .I hope when you read this letter you will have received the\r\nfirst part of my Brazilian Fishes from M.--, of Geneva, to whom\r\nMartius had to send a package of plants, with which my book was\r\ninclosed. I venture to think that this work will give me a name,\r\nand I await with impatience the criticism that I suppose it will\r\nreceive from Cuvier. . .I think the best way of reaching the\r\nvarious aims I have in view is to continue the career on which I\r\nhave started, and to publish as soon as possible my natural history\r\nof the fresh-water fishes of Germany and Switzerland. I propose to\r\nissue it in numbers, each containing twelve colored plates\r\naccompanied by six sheets of letter-press. . .In the middle of\r\nSeptember there is to be a meeting of all the naturalists and\r\nmedical men of Germany, to which foreign savants are invited. A\r\nsimilar meeting has been held for the last two or three years in\r\none or another of the brilliant centres of Germany. This year it\r\nwill take place at Heidelberg. Could one desire a better occasion\r\nto make known a projected work? I could even show the original\r\ndrawings already made of species only found in the environs of\r\nMunich, and, so to speak, unknown to naturalists. At Heidelberg\r\nwill be assembled Englishmen, Danes, Swedes, Russians, and even\r\nItalians. If I could before then arrange everything and distribute\r\nthe printed circulars of my work I should be sure of success. . .\r\n\r\nIn those days of costly postage one sheet of writing paper was\r\nsometimes made to serve for several members of the family. The next\r\ncrowded letter contains chiefly domestic details, but closes with a\r\npostscript from Mme. Agassiz, filling, as she says, the only\r\nremaining corner, and expressing her delight in his diploma and in\r\nthe completion of his book.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nAugust 16, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .The place your brother has left me seems very insufficient for\r\nall that I have to say, dear Louis, but I will begin by thanking\r\nyou for the happiness, as sweet as it is deeply felt, which your\r\nsuccess has given us. Already our satisfaction becomes the reward\r\nof your efforts. We wait with impatience for the moment when we\r\nshall see you and talk with you. Your correspondence leaves many\r\nblanks, and we are sometimes quite ashamed that we have so few\r\ndetails to give about your book. You will be surprised that it has\r\nnot yet reached us. Does the gentleman in Geneva intend to read it\r\nbefore sending it to us, or has he perhaps not received the\r\npackage? Not hearing we are uneasy. . .Good-by, my dear son; I have\r\nno room for more, except to add my tender love for you. An\r\nhonorable mention of your name in the Lausanne Gazette has brought\r\nus many pleasant congratulations. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .I hope by this time you have my book. I can the less explain\r\nthe delay since M. Cuvier, to whom I sent it in the same way, has\r\nacknowledged its arrival. I inclose his letter, hoping it will give\r\nyou pleasure to read what one of the greatest naturalists of the\r\nage writes me about it.\r\n\r\nCUVIER TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, AU JARDIN DU ROI, August 3, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .You and M. de Martius have done me honor in placing my name at\r\nthe head of a work so admirable as the one you have just published.\r\nThe importance and the rarity of the species therein described, as\r\nwell as the beauty of the figures, will make the work an important\r\none in ichthyology, and nothing could heighten its value more than\r\nthe accuracy of your descriptions. It will be of the greatest use\r\nto me in my History of Fishes. I had already referred to the plates\r\nin the second edition of my \"Regne Animal.\" I shall do all in my\r\npower to accelerate the sale among amateurs, either by showing it\r\nto such as meet at my house or by calling attention to it in\r\nscientific journals.\r\n\r\nI look with great interest for your history of the fishes of the\r\nAlps. It cannot but fill a wide gap in that portion of natural\r\nhistory,--above all, in the different divisions of the genus Salmo.\r\nThe figures of Bloch, those of Meidinger, and those of Marsigli,\r\nare quite insufficient. We have the greater part of the species\r\nhere, so that it will be easy for me to verify the characters; but\r\nonly an artist, working on the spot, with specimens fresh from the\r\nwater, can secure the colors. You will, no doubt, have much to add\r\nalso respecting the development, habits, and use of all these\r\nfishes. Perhaps you would do well to limit yourself at first to a\r\nmonograph of the Salmones.\r\n\r\nWith my thanks for the promised documents, accept the assurance of\r\nmy warm regard and very sincere attachment.\r\n\r\nB.G. CUVIER.\r\n\r\nAt last comes the moment, so long anticipated, when the young\r\nnaturalist's first book is in the hands of his parents. The news of\r\nits reception is given in a short and hurried note.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, August 31, 1829.\r\n\r\nI hasten, my dear son, to announce the arrival of your beautiful\r\nwork, which reached us on Thursday, from Geneva. I have no terms in\r\nwhich to express the pleasure it has given me. In two words, for I\r\nhave only a moment to myself, I repeat my urgent entreaty that you\r\nwould hasten your return as much as possible. . .The old father,\r\nwho waits for you with open heart and arms, sends you the most\r\ntender greeting. . .\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n1829-1830: AGE 22-23.\r\n\r\nScientific Meeting at Heidelberg.\r\nVisit at Home.\r\nIllness and Death of his Grandfather.\r\nReturn to Munich.\r\nPlans for Future Scientific Publications.\r\nTakes his Degree of Medicine.\r\nVisit to Vienna.\r\nReturn to Munich.\r\nHome Letters.\r\nLast Days at Munich.\r\nAutobiographical Review of School and University Life.\r\n\r\nTO HIS PARENTS.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, September 25, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .THE time of our meeting is almost at hand. Relieved from all\r\nanxiety about the subjects I had wished to present here, I can now\r\nbe quietly with you and enjoy the rest and freedom I have so long\r\nneeded. The tension of mind, forced upon me by the effort to reach\r\nmy goal in time, has crowded out the thoughts which are most\r\npresent when I am at peace. I will not talk to you of what I have\r\nbeen doing lately, (a short letter from Frankfort will have put you\r\non my track), nor of the relations I have formed at the Heidelberg\r\nmeeting, nor of the manner in which I have been received, etc.\r\nThese are matters better told than written. . .I intend to leave\r\nhere to-morrow or the day after, according to circumstances. I\r\nshall stay some days at Carlsruhe to put my affairs in order, and\r\nfrom there make the journey home as quickly as possible. . .\r\n\r\nThe following month we find him once more at home in the parsonage\r\nof Orbe. After the first pleasure and excitement of return, his\r\ntime was chiefly spent in arranging his collections at Cudrefin,\r\nwhere his grandfather had given him house-room for them. In this\r\nwork he had the help of the family in general, who made a sort of\r\nscientific fete of the occasion. But it ended sadly with the\r\nillness and death of the kind old grandfather, under whose roof\r\nchildren and grandchildren had been wont to assemble.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO BRAUN.\r\n\r\nORBE, December 3, 1829.\r\n\r\n. . .I will devote an hour of this last evening I am to pass in\r\nOrbe, to talking with you. You will wonder that I am still here,\r\nand that I have not written. You already know that I have been\r\narranging my collections at Cudrefin, and spending very happy days\r\nwith my grandfather. But he is now very ill, and even should we\r\nhave better news of him to-day, the thought weighs heavily on my\r\nheart, that I must take leave of him when he is perhaps on his\r\ndeath-bed. . .I have just tied up my last package of plants, and\r\nthere lies my whole herbarium in order,--thirty packages in all.\r\nFor this I have to thank you, dear Alex, and it gives me pleasure\r\nto tell you so and to be reminded of it. What a succession of\r\nglorious memories came up to me as I turned them over. Free from\r\nall disturbing incidents, I enjoyed anew our life together, and\r\neven more, if possible, than in actual experience. Every talk,\r\nevery walk, was present to me again, and in reviewing it all I saw\r\nhow our minds had been drawn to each other in an ever-strengthening\r\nunion. In you I see my own intellectual development reflected as in\r\na mirror, for to you, and to my intercourse with you, I owe my\r\nentrance upon this path of the noblest and most lasting enjoyment.\r\nIt is delightful to look back on such a past with the future so\r\nbright before us. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz now returned to Munich to add the title of Doctor of\r\nMedicine to that of Doctor of Philosophy. A case of somnambulism,\r\nwhich fell under his observation and showed him disease, or, at\r\nleast, abnormal action of the brain, under an aspect which was new\r\nto him, seems to have given a fresh impulse to his medical studies,\r\nand, for a time, he was inclined to believe that the vocation which\r\nhad thus far been to him one of necessity, might become one of\r\npreference. But the naturalist was stronger than the physician.\r\nDuring this very winter, when he was preparing himself with new\r\nearnestness for his profession, a collection of fossil fishes was\r\nput into his hands by the Director of the Museum of Munich. It will\r\nbe seen with what ardor he threw himself into this new\r\ninvestigation. His work on the \"Poissons Fossiles,\" which placed\r\nhim in a few years in the front rank of European scientific men,\r\ntook form at once in his fertile brain.\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, January 18, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .My resolve to study medicine is now confirmed. I feel all that\r\nmay be done to render this study worthy the name of science, which\r\nit has so long usurped. Its intimate alliance with the natural\r\nsciences and the enlightenment it promises me regarding them are\r\nindeed my chief incitements to persevere in my resolution. In order\r\nto gain time, and to strike while the iron is hot (don't be afraid\r\nit will grow cold; the wood which feeds the fire is good), I have\r\nproposed to Euler, with whom I am very intimate, to review the\r\nmedical course with me. Since then, we pass all our evenings\r\ntogether, and rarely separate before midnight,--reading alternately\r\nFrench and German medical books. In this way, although I devote my\r\nwhole day to my own work about fishes, I hope to finish my\r\nprofessional studies before summer. I shall then pass my\r\nexamination for the Doctorate in Germany, and afterward do the same\r\nin Lausanne. I hope that this decision will please mama. My\r\ncharacter and conduct are the pledge of its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is my night-work. I have still to tell you what I do by\r\nday, and this is more important. My first duty is to complete my\r\nBrazilian Fishes. To be sure, it is only an honorary work, but it\r\nmust be finished, and is an additional means of making subsequent\r\nworks profitable. This is my morning occupation, and I am sure of\r\nbringing it to a close about Easter. After much reflection, I have\r\ndecided that the best way to turn my Fresh-Water Fishes to account,\r\nis to finish them completely before offering them to a publisher.\r\nAll the expenses being then paid, I could afford, if the first\r\npublisher should not feel able to take them on my own terms, to\r\nkeep them as a safe investment. The publisher himself seeing the\r\nmaterial finished, and being sure of bringing it out as a complete\r\nwork, the value of which he can on that account better estimate,\r\nwill be more disposed to accept my proposals, while I, on my side,\r\ncan be more exacting. The text for this I write in the afternoon.\r\nMy greatest difficulty at first was the execution of the plates.\r\nBut here, also, my good star has served me wonderfully. I told you\r\nthat beside the complete drawings of the fishes I wanted to\r\nrepresent their skeletons and the anatomy of the soft parts, which\r\nhas never been done for this class. I shall thereby give a new\r\nvalue to the work, and make it desirable for all who study\r\ncomparative anatomy. The puzzle was to find some one who was\r\nprepared to draw things of this kind; but I have made the luckiest\r\nhit, and am more than satisfied. My former artist continues to draw\r\nthe fishes, a second draws the skeletons (one who had already been\r\nengaged for several years in the same way, for a work upon\r\nreptiles), while a young physician, who is an admirable\r\ndraughtsman, makes my anatomical figures. For my share, I direct\r\ntheir work while writing the text, and thus the whole advances with\r\ngreat strides. I do not, however, stop here. Having by permission\r\nof the Director of the Museum one of the finest collections of\r\nfossils in Germany at my disposition, and being also allowed to\r\ntake the specimens home as I need them, I have undertaken to\r\npublish the ichthyological part of the collection. Since it only\r\nmakes the difference of one or two people more to direct, I have\r\nthese specimens also drawn at the same time. Nowhere so well as\r\nhere, where the Academy of Fine Arts brings together so many\r\ndraughtsmen, could I have the same facility for completing a\r\nsimilar work; and as it is an entirely new branch, in which no one\r\nhas as yet done anything of importance, I feel sure of success; the\r\nmore so because Cuvier, who alone could do it (for the simple\r\nreason that every one else has till now neglected the fishes), is\r\nnot engaged upon it. Add to this that just now there is a real need\r\nof this work for the determination of the different geological\r\nformations. Once before, at the Heidelberg meeting, it had been\r\nproposed to me; the Director of the Mines at Strasbourg, M. Voltz,\r\neven offered to send me at Munich the whole collection of fossil\r\nfishes from their Museum. I did not speak to you of this at the\r\ntime because it would have been of no use. But now that I have it\r\nin my power to carry out the project, I should be a fool to let a\r\nchance escape me which certainly will not present itself a second\r\ntime so favorably. It is therefore my intention to prepare a\r\ngeneral work on fossil ichthyology. I hope, if I can command\r\nanother hundred louis, to complete everything of which I have\r\nspoken before the end of the summer, that is to say, in July. I\r\nshall then have on hand two works which should surely be worth a\r\nthousand louis to me. This is a low estimate, for even ephemeral\r\npieces and literary ventures are paid at this price. You can easily\r\nmake the calculation. They allow three louis for each plate with\r\nthe accompanying text; my fossils will have about two hundred\r\nplates, and my fresh-water fishes about one hundred and fifty. This\r\nseems to me plausible. . .\r\n\r\nThis letter evidently made a favorable impression on the business\r\nheads of the family at Neuchatel, for it is forwarded to his\r\nparents, with these words from his brother on the last sheet: \"I\r\nhasten, dear father, to send you this excellent letter from my\r\nbrother, which has just reached me. They have read it here with\r\ninterest, and Uncle Francois Mayor, especially, sees both stability\r\nand a sound basis in his projects and enterprises.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something touching and almost amusing in Agassiz's efforts\r\nto give a prudential aspect to his large scientific schemes. He was\r\nperfectly sincere in this, but to the end of his life he skirted\r\nthe edge of the precipice, daring all, and finding in himself the\r\npower to justify his risks by his successes. He was of frugal\r\npersonal habits; at this very time, when he was keeping two or\r\nthree artists on his slender means, he made his own breakfast in\r\nhis room, and dined for a few cents a day at the cheapest eating\r\nhouses. But where science was concerned the only economy he\r\nrecognized, either in youth or old age, was that of an expenditure\r\nas bold as it was carefully considered.\r\n\r\nIn the above letter to his brother we have the story of his work\r\nduring the whole winter of 1830. That his medical studies did not\r\nsuffer from the fact that, in conjunction with them, he was\r\ncarrying on his two great works on the living and the dead world of\r\nfishes may be inferred from the following account of his medical\r\ntheses. It was written after his death, to his son Alexander\r\nAgassiz, by Professor von Siebold, now Director of the Museum in\r\nthe University of Munich. \"How earnestly Agassiz devoted himself to\r\nthe study of medicine is shown by the theses (seventy-four in\r\nnumber), a list of which was printed, according to the prescribed\r\nrule and custom, with his 'Einladung.' I am astonished at the great\r\nnumber of these. The subjects are anatomical, pathological,\r\nsurgical, obstetrical; they are inquiries into materia medica,\r\nmedicina forensis, and the relation of botany to these topics. One\r\nof them interested me especially. It read as follows. 'Foemina\r\nhumana superior mare.' I would gladly have known how your father\r\ninterpreted that sentence. Last fall (1873) I wrote him a letter,\r\nthe last I ever addressed to him, questioning him about this very\r\nsubject. That letter, alas! remained unanswered.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his brother just before taking his degree, Agassiz\r\nsays: \"I am now determined to pursue medicine and natural history\r\nside by side. Thank you, with all my heart, for your disinterested\r\noffer, but I shall not need it, for I am going on well with my\r\npublisher, M. Cotta, of Stuttgart. I have great hope that he will\r\naccept my works, since he has desired that they should be forwarded\r\nto him for examination. I have sent him the whole, and I feel very\r\nsure he will swallow the pill. My conditions would be the only\r\ncause of delay, but I hope he will agree to them. For the\r\nfresh-water fishes and the fossils together I have asked twenty\r\nthousand Swiss francs. Should he not consent to this, I shall apply\r\nto another publisher.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of April he received his degree of Doctor of Medicine. A\r\nday or two later he writes to his mother that her great desire for\r\nhim is accomplished.\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, April, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .My letter to-day must be to you, for to you I owe it that I\r\nhave undertaken the work just completed, and I write to thank you\r\nfor having encouraged my zeal. I am very sure that no letter from\r\nme has ever given you greater pleasure than this one will bring;\r\nand I can truly say, on my own part, that I have never written one\r\nwith greater satisfaction. Yesterday I finished my medical\r\nexamination, after having satisfied every requirement of the\r\nFaculty. . .The whole ceremony lasted nine days. At the close,\r\nwhile they considered my case, I was sent out of the room. On my\r\nreturn, the Dean said to me, \"The Faculty have been VERY MUCH\"\r\n(emphasized) \"pleased with your answers; they congratulate\r\nthemselves on being able to give the diploma to a young man who has\r\nalready acquired so honorable a reputation. On Saturday, after\r\nhaving argued your thesis, you will receive your degree, in the\r\nAcademic Hall, from the Rector of the University.\" The Rector then\r\nadded that he should look upon it as the brightest moment of his\r\nRectorship when he conferred upon me the title I had so well\r\nmerited. Next Saturday, then, at the very time you receive this\r\nletter, at ten o'clock in the morning, the discussion will have\r\nbegun, and at twelve I shall have my degree. Dear Mother, dismiss\r\nall anxiety about me. You see I am as good as my word. . .Write\r\nsoon; in a few days I go to Vienna for some months. . .\r\n\r\nFROM HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, April 7, 1830.\r\n\r\nI cannot thank you enough, my dear Louis, for the happiness you\r\nhave given me in completing your medical examinations, and thus\r\nsecuring to yourself a career as safe as it is honorable. It is a\r\nlaurel added to those you have already won; in my eyes the most\r\nprecious of all. You have for my sake gone through a long and\r\narduous task; were it in my power I would gladly reward you, but I\r\ncannot even say that I love you the more for it, because that is\r\nimpossible. My anxious solicitude for your future is a proof of my\r\nardent affection for you; only one thing was wanting to make me the\r\nhappiest of mothers, and this, my Louis, you have just given me.\r\nMay God reward you by giving you all possible success in the care\r\nof your fellow-beings. May the benedictions which honor the memory\r\nof a good physician be your portion, as they have been in the\r\nhighest degree that of your grandfather. Why can he not be here to\r\nshare my happiness to-day in seeing my Louis a medical graduate!. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz was recalled from Vienna in less than two months by the\r\narrival in Munich of his publisher, M. Cotta, a personal interview\r\nwith whom seemed to him important. The only letter preserved from\r\nthe Vienna visit shows that his short stay there was full of\r\ninterest and instruction.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nVIENNA, May 11, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .Since my arrival I have seen so much that I hardly know where\r\nto begin my narrative, and what I have seen has suggested\r\nreflections on many grave subjects, of a kind I had hardly expected\r\nto make here. Nowhere have I seen establishments on broader or more\r\nstately foundations, nor do I believe that anywhere are foreigners\r\nallowed more liberal use of like institutions. I speak of the\r\nuniversity, the hospitals, libraries, and collections of all sorts.\r\nNeither have I seen anywhere else such fine churches, and I have\r\nmore than once felt the difference between worshiping within bare\r\nwalls, and in buildings more worthy of devotional purposes. In one\r\nword, I should be enchanted with my stay in Vienna if I could be\r\nfree from the idea that I am always surrounded by an imperceptible\r\nnet, ready to close upon me at the slightest signal. With this\r\nexception, the only discomfort to a foreigner here, if he is\r\nunaccustomed to it, is that of being obliged to abstain from all\r\ncriticism of affairs in public places; still more must he avoid\r\ncommenting upon persons. I am especially satisfied with my visit\r\nfrom a scientific point of view. I have learned, and am still\r\nlearning, the care of the eyes and how to operate upon them; as to\r\nmedicine, the physicians, however good, do not surpass those I have\r\nalready known; and as I do not believe it important that a young\r\nphysician should familiarize himself with a great variety of\r\ncurative methods, I try to observe carefully the patient and his\r\ndisease rather than to remember the medicaments applied in special\r\ncases. Surgery and midwifery are poorly provided, but one has a\r\nchance to see many interesting cases.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fortnight I have visited the collection of natural\r\nhistory often, generally in the afternoon. To tell you how I have\r\nbeen expected there from the moment I was known to be here, and how\r\nI was received on my first visit, and have been feted since (as\r\nIchthyologus primus seculi,--so they say), would, perhaps, tire you\r\nand might seem egotistical in me, neither of which do I desire. But\r\nit will not be indifferent to you to know that Cotta is disposed to\r\naccept my Fishes. He has been at Munich for some days, and Schimper\r\nhas been talking with him, and has advanced matters more by a few\r\nwords than I had been able to do by much writing. For this reason I\r\nintend returning soon to Munich to complete the business, since\r\nCotta is to be there several weeks longer. Thus I shall have\r\nreached my aim, and be provided from this autumn onward with an\r\nindependent maintenance. I was often very anxious this past winter,\r\nin my uncertainty about the means of finally making good such large\r\noutlays. If, however, Cotta makes no other condition than that of a\r\ncertain number of subscribers, I shall be sure of them in six months.\r\nYou may thus regard what I have done as a speculation happily\r\nconcluded, and one which places me at the summit of my desires, for\r\nit leaves me free, at last, to work upon my projects. . .\r\n\r\nA letter to his brother, of the 29th of May, just after his return\r\nto Munich, gives a retrospect of the Viennese visit, including the\r\npersonal details which he had hesitated to write to his father.\r\nThey are important as showing the position he already, at\r\ntwenty-three years of age, held among scientific men. \"Everything,\"\r\nhe says, \"was open to me as a foreigner, and to my great surprise I\r\nwas received as an associate already known. Was it not gratifying\r\nto go to Vienna with no recommendation whatever, and to be welcomed\r\nand sought by all the scientific men, and afterwards presented and\r\nintroduced everywhere? In the Museum, not only were the rooms\r\nopened for me when I pleased, but also the cases, and even the\r\njars, so that I could take out whatever I needed for examination.\r\nAt the hospital several professors carried their kindness so far,\r\nas to invite me to accompany them in their private visits. You may\r\nfancy whether I profited by all this, and how many things I saw.\"\r\nAfter some account of his business arrangements with Cotta, he adds\r\n\"Meantime, be at ease about me. I have strings enough to my bow,\r\nand need not feel anxious about the future. What troubles me is\r\nthat the thing I most desire seems to me, at least for the present,\r\nfarthest from my reach,--namely, the direction of a great Museum.\r\nWhen I have finished with Cotta I shall begin to pack my effects,\r\nand shall hope to turn my face homeward somewhere about the end of\r\nAugust. I can hardly leave earlier, because, for the sake of\r\npractice, I have begun to deliver zoological lectures, open to all\r\nwho like to attend, and I want to complete the course before my\r\ndeparture. I lecture without even an outline or headings before me,\r\nbut this requires preparation. You see I do not lose my time.\"\r\n\r\nThe next home letter announces an important change in the family\r\naffairs. His father had been called from his parish at Orbe to that\r\nof Concise, a small town situated on the south-western shore of the\r\nLake of Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nORBE, July, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .Since your father wrote you on the 4th of June, dear Louis, we\r\nhave had no news from you, and therefore infer that you are working\r\nwith especial zeal to wind up your affairs in Germany and come home\r\nas soon as possible. Whatever haste you make, however, you will not\r\nfind us here. Four days ago your father became pastor of Concise,\r\nand yesterday we went to visit our new home. Nothing can be\r\nprettier, and by all who know the place it is considered the most\r\ndesirable position in the canton. There is a vineyard, a fine\r\norchard filled with fruit-trees in full bearing, and an excellent\r\nkitchen garden. A never-failing spring gushes from a grotto, and\r\nwithin fifty steps of the house is a pretty winding stream with a\r\nwalk along the bank, bordered by shrubbery, and furnished here and\r\nthere with benches, the whole disposed with much care and taste.\r\nThe house also is very well arranged. All the rooms look out upon\r\nthe lake, lying hardly a gunshot from the windows. There are a\r\nparlor and a dining-room on the first floor, beside two smaller\r\nrooms; and on the same floor two doors lead out into the flower\r\ngarden. The kitchen is small, and on one side is a pretty ground\r\nwhere we can dine in the open air in summer. The distribution of\r\nrooms in the upper story is the same, with a large additional room\r\nfor the accommodation of your father's catechumens. A jasmine vine\r\ndrapes the front of the house and climbs to the very roof. . .\r\n\r\nTo this quiet pretty parsonage Madame Agassiz became much attached.\r\nHer tranquil life is well described in a letter written many years\r\nafterward by one of her daughters. \"Here mama returned to her\r\nspinning-wheel with new ardor. It was a work she much liked, and in\r\nwhich she was very skillful. In former times at grandpapa's every\r\nwoman in the house, whether mistress or maid, had her wheel, and\r\nthe young ladies were accustomed to spin and make up their own\r\ntrousseaus. Later, mama continued her spinning for her children,\r\nand even for her grandchildren. We all preserve as a precious\r\nsouvenir, table linen of her making. We delighted to see her at her\r\nwheel, she was so graceful, and the thread of her thought seemed to\r\nfollow, so to speak, the fine and delicate thread of her work as it\r\nunwound itself under her touch from the distaff.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz was detained by his publishing arrangements and his work\r\nlonger than he had expected, and November was already advanced\r\nbefore his preparations for leaving Munich were completed.\r\n\r\nTO HIS PARENTS.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 9, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .According to your wish [this refers to a suggestion about a\r\nfellow-student in a previous letter] I shall not bring any friend\r\nwith me. I long to enjoy the pleasure of family life. I shall,\r\nhowever, be accompanied by one person, for whom I should like to\r\nmake suitable arrangements. He is the artist who makes all my\r\ndrawings. If there is no room for him in the house he can be lodged\r\nelsewhere; but I wish you could give me the use of a well-lighted\r\nroom, where I could work and he could draw at my side through the\r\nday. Do not be frightened; he is not at my charge; but it would be\r\na great advantage to me if I could have him in the house. As I do\r\nnot want to lose time in the mechanical part of my work, I would\r\nbeg papa to engage for me some handy boy, fifteen years old or so,\r\nwhom I could employ in cleaning skeletons and the like. Finally,\r\nyou will receive several boxes for me; leave them unopened till I\r\ncome, without even paying the freight upon them,--the most\r\nunsatisfactory of all expenses;--and I do not wish you to have an\r\nunpleasant association with my collections.\r\n\r\nMy affairs are all in order with Cotta, and I have even concluded\r\nthe arrangement more advantageously than I had dared to hope,--a\r\nthousand louis, six hundred payable on the publication of the first\r\nnumber, and four hundred in installments, as the publication\r\ngoeson. If I had not been in haste to close the matter in order to\r\nsecure myself against all doubt, I might have done even better. But\r\nI hope I have reconciled you thereby to Natural History. What\r\nremains to be done will be the work of less than half a year,\r\nduring which I wish also to get together the materials for my\r\nsecond work, on the fossils. Of that I have already spoken with my\r\npublisher, and he will take it on more favorable conditions than I\r\ncould have dictated. Do your best to find me subscribers, that we\r\nmay soon make our typographical arrangements. . .\r\n\r\nHis father's answer, full of fun as it is, shows, nevertheless,\r\nthat the prospect of domesticating not only the naturalist and his\r\ncollections, but artist and assistant also, was rather startling.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nCONCISE, November 16, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .You speak of Christmas as the moment of your arrival; let us\r\ncall it the New Year. You will naturally pass some days at\r\nNeuchatel to be with your brother, to see the Messrs. Coulon, etc.;\r\nfrom there to Cudrefin for a look at your collection; then to\r\nConcise, then to Montagny, Orbe, Lausanne, Geneva, etc. M. le\r\nDocteur will be claimed and feted by all in turn. And during all\r\nthese indispensable excursions, for which, to be within bounds, I\r\nallow a month at least, it is as clear as daylight that regular\r\nwork must be set aside, if, indeed, the time be not wholly lost.\r\nNow, for Heaven's sake, what will you do, or rather what shall WE\r\ndo, with your painter, in this interval employed by you elsewhere.\r\nNeither is this all. Though the date of Cecile's marriage is not\r\nfixed, it is more than likely to take place in January, so that you\r\nwill be here for the wedding. If you will recollect the overturning\r\nof the paternal mansion when your outfit was preparing for Bienne,\r\nZurich, and other places, you can form an idea of the state of our\r\nrooms above and below, large and small, when the work of the\r\ntrousseau begins. Where, in Heaven's name, will you stow away a\r\npainter and an assistant in the midst of half a brigade of\r\ndress-makers, seamstresses, lace-makers, and milliners, without\r\ncounting the accompanying train of friends? Where would you, or\r\nwhere could you, put under shelter your possessions (I dare not\r\nundertake to enumerate them), among all the taffetas and brocades,\r\nlinens, muslin, tulles, laces, etc.? But what am I saying? I doubt\r\nif these names are still in existence, for quite other appellations\r\nare sounding in my ears, each one of which, to the number of some\r\nhundred, signifies at least twenty yards in width, to say nothing\r\nof the length. For my part, I have already, notwithstanding the\r\napproach of winter, put up a big nail in the garret, on which to\r\nhang my bands and surplice. Listen, then, to the conclusion of your\r\nfather. Give all possible care to your affairs in Munich, put them\r\nin perfect order, leave nothing to be done, and leave nothing\r\nbehind EXCEPT THE PAINTER. You can call him in from here, whenever\r\nyou think you can make use of him.\r\n\r\nTO HIS PARENTS.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 26, 1830.\r\n\r\n. . .When you receive this I shall be no longer in Munich; by means\r\nof a last draft on M. Eichthal I have settled with every one, and I\r\nhope to leave the day after to-morrow. I fully recognize the\r\njustice of your observations, my dear father, but as you start from\r\na mistaken point of view, they do not coincide altogether with\r\nexisting circumstances. I intend to stay with you until the\r\napproach of summer, not only with the aim of working upon the text\r\nof my book, but chiefly in order to take advantage of all the\r\nfossil collections in Switzerland. For that purpose I positively\r\nneed a draughtsman, who, thanks to my publisher, is not in my pay,\r\nand who must accompany me in future wherever I go. Since there is\r\nno room at home, please see how he can be lodged in the\r\nneighborhood. I have, at the utmost, to glance each day at what he\r\nhas done. I can even give him work for several weeks in which my\r\npresence would be unnecessary. If there is a considerable\r\ncollection of fossils at Zurich, I shall leave him there till he\r\nhas finished his work, and then he will rejoin me; all that depends\r\nupon circumstances. In any case he must not be a charge to you,\r\nstill less interfere with our family privacy. That I may spend all\r\nmy time with you, I shall at present bring with me nothing that is\r\nnot absolutely necessary. We shall see later where I shall place my\r\nmuseum. As to visits, they are not to be thought of until the\r\nspring. I could not bear the idea of interruption before the first\r\nnumber of my \"Fishes\" is finished.\r\n\r\nThe artist in question was Mr. Dinkel. His relations with the\r\nfamily became of a truly friendly character. The connection between\r\nhim and Agassiz, most honorable to both parties, lasted for sixteen\r\nyears, and was then only interrupted by the departure of Agassiz\r\nfor America. During this whole period Mr. Dinkel was occupied as\r\nhis draughtsman, living sometimes in Paris, sometimes in England,\r\nsometimes in Switzerland, wherever, in short, there were specimens\r\nto be drawn. In a private letter, written long afterward, he says,\r\nin speaking of the break in their intercourse caused by Agassiz's\r\nremoval to America: \"For a long time I felt unhappy at that\r\nseparation. . .He was a kind, noble-hearted friend; he was very\r\nbenevolent, and if he had possessed millions of money he would have\r\nspent them for his researches in science, and have done good to his\r\nfellow-creatures as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\nSome passages from Braun's letters complete the chapter of these\r\nyears in Munich, so rich in purpose and in experience, the prelude,\r\nas it were, to the intellectual life of the two friends who had\r\nentered upon them together. These extracts show how seriously, not\r\nwithout a certain sadness, they near the end.\r\n\r\nBRAUN TO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, November 7, 1830.\r\n\r\nWere I to leave Munich now, I must separate myself from Agassiz and\r\nSchimper, which would be neither agreeable nor advantageous for me,\r\nnor would it be friendly toward them. We will not shorten the time,\r\nalready too scantly measured, which we may still spend so quietly,\r\nso wholly by ourselves, but rather, as long as it lasts, make the\r\nbest use of it in a mutual exchange of what we have learned, trying\r\nto encourage each other in the right path, and drawing more closely\r\ntogether for our whole life to come. Agassiz is to stay till the\r\nend of the month; during this time he will give us lectures in\r\nanatomy, and I shall learn a good deal of zoology. Beside all this\r\none thing is certain; namely, that we can review our medical work\r\nmuch more quietly and uninterruptedly here than in Carlsruhe. Add\r\nto this, the advantage we enjoy here of visiting the hospitals. . .\r\nThe time passes delightfully with us of late, for Agassiz has\r\nreceived several baskets of books from Cotta, among others,\r\nSchiller's and Goethe's complete works, the Conversations-Lexicon,\r\nmedical works, and works on natural history. How many books a man\r\nmay receive in return for writing only one! They are, of course,\r\ndeducted from his share of the profits. Yesterday we did nothing\r\nbut read Goethe the whole day.\r\n\r\nA brief account of Agassiz's university life, dictated by himself,\r\nmay fitly close the record of this period. He was often urged to\r\nput together a few reminiscences of his life, but he lived so\r\nintensely in the present, every day bringing its full task, that he\r\nhad little time for retrospect, and this sketch remained a\r\nfragment. It includes some facts already told, but is given almost\r\nverbatim, because it forms a sort of summary of his intellectual\r\ndevelopment up to this date.\r\n\r\n\"I am conscious that at successive periods of my life I have\r\nemployed very different means and followed very different systems\r\nof study. I may, therefore, be allowed to offer the result of my\r\nexperience as a contribution toward the building up of a sound\r\nmethod for the promotion of the study of nature.\r\n\r\n\"At first, when a mere boy, twelve years of age, I did what most\r\nbeginners do. I picked up whatever I could lay my hands on, and\r\ntried, by such books and authorities as I had at my command, to\r\nfind the names of these objects. My highest ambition, at that time,\r\nwas to be able to designate the plants and animals of my native\r\ncountry correctly by a Latin name, and to extend gradually a\r\nsimilar knowledge in its application to the productions of other\r\ncountries. This seemed to me, in those days, the legitimate aim and\r\nproper work of a naturalist. I still possess manuscript volumes in\r\nwhich I entered the names of all the animals and plants with which\r\nI became acquainted, and I well remember that I then ardently hoped\r\nto acquire the same superficial familiarity with the whole\r\ncreation. I did not then know how much more important it is to the\r\nnaturalist to understand the structure of a few animals, than to\r\ncommand the whole field of scientific nomenclature. Since I have\r\nbecome a teacher, and have watched the progress of students, I have\r\nseen that they all begin in the same way; but how many have grown\r\nold in the pursuit, without ever rising to any higher conception of\r\nthe study of nature, spending their life in the determination of\r\nspecies, and in extending scientific terminology! Long before I\r\nwent to the university, and before I began to study natural history\r\nunder the guidance of men who were masters in the science during\r\nthe early part of this century, I perceived that while nomenclature\r\nand classification, as then understood, formed an important part of\r\nthe study, being, in fact, its technical language, the study of\r\nliving beings in their natural element was of infinitely greater\r\nvalue. At that age, namely, about fifteen, I spent most of the time\r\nI could spare from classical and mathematical studies in hunting\r\nthe neighboring woods and meadows for birds, insects, and land and\r\nfresh-water shells. My room became a little menagerie, while the\r\nstone basin under the fountain in our yard was my reservoir for all\r\nthe fishes I could catch. Indeed, collecting, fishing, and raising\r\ncaterpillars, from which I reared fresh, beautiful butterflies,\r\nwere then my chief pastimes. What I know of the habits of the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Central Europe I mostly learned at that time;\r\nand I may add, that when afterward I obtained access to a large\r\nlibrary and could consult the works of Bloch and Lacepede, the only\r\nextensive works on fishes then in existence, I wondered that they\r\ncontained so little about their habits, natural attitudes, and mode\r\nof action with which I was so familiar.\r\n\r\n\"The first course of lectures on zoology I attended was given in\r\nLausanne in 1823. It consisted chiefly of extracts from Cuvier's\r\n'Regne Animal,' and from Lamarck's 'Animaux sans Vertebres.' I now\r\nbecame aware, for the first time, that the learned differ in their\r\nclassifications. With this discovery, an immense field of study\r\nopened before me, and I longed for some knowledge of anatomy, that\r\nI might see for myself where the truth was. During two years spent\r\nin the Medical School of Zurich, I applied myself exclusively to\r\nthe study of anatomy, physiology, and zoology, under the guidance\r\nof Professors Schinz and Hirzel. My inability to buy books was,\r\nperhaps, not so great a misfortune as it seemed to me; at least, it\r\nsaved me from too great dependence on written authority. I spent\r\nall my time in dissecting animals and in studying human anatomy,\r\nnot forgetting my favorite amusements of fishing and collecting. I\r\nwas always surrounded with pets, and had at this time some forty\r\nbirds flying about my study, with no other home than a large\r\npine-tree in the corner. I still remember my grief when a visitor,\r\nentering suddenly, caught one of my little favorites between the\r\nfloor and the door, and he was killed before I could extricate him.\r\nProfessor Schinz's private collection of birds was my daily resort,\r\nand I then described every bird it contained, as I could not afford\r\nto buy even a text-book of ornithology. I also copied with my own\r\nhand, having no means of purchasing the work, two volumes of\r\nLamarck's 'Animaux sans Vertebres,' and my dear brother copied\r\nanother half volume for me. I finally learned that the study of the\r\nthings themselves was far more attractive than the books I so much\r\ncoveted; and when, at last, large libraries became accessible to\r\nme, I usually contented myself with turning over the leaves of the\r\nvolumes on natural history, looking at the illustrations, and\r\nrecording the titles of the works, that I might readily consult\r\nthem for identification of such objects as I should have an\r\nopportunity of examining in nature.\r\n\r\n\"After spending in this way two years in Zurich, I was attracted to\r\nHeidelberg by the great reputation of its celebrated teachers,\r\nTiedemann, Leuckart, Bronn, and others. It is true that I was still\r\nobliged to give up a part of my time to the study of medicine, but\r\nwhile advancing in my professional course by a steady application\r\nto anatomy and physiology, I attended the lectures of Leuckart in\r\nzoology, and those of Bronn in paleontology. The publication of\r\nGoldfuss's great work on the fossils of Germany was just then\r\nbeginning, and it opened a new world to me. Familiar as I was with\r\nCuvier's 'Regne Animal,' I had not then seen his 'Researches on\r\nFossil Remains,' and the study of fossils seemed to me only an\r\nextension of the field of zoology. I had no idea of its direct\r\nconnection with geology, or of its bearing on the problem of the\r\nsuccessive introduction of animals on the earth. I had never\r\nthought of the larger and more philosophical view of nature as one\r\ngreat world, but considered the study of animals only as it was\r\ntaught by descriptive zoology in those days. At about this time,\r\nhowever, I made the acquaintance of two young botanists, Braun and\r\nSchimper, both of whom have since become distinguished in the\r\nannals of science. Botany had in those days received a new impulse\r\nfrom the great conceptions of Goethe. The metamorphosis of plants\r\nwas the chief study of my friends, and I could not but feel that\r\ndescriptive zoology had not spoken the last word in our science,\r\nand that grand generalizations, such as were opening upon\r\nbotanists, must be preparing for zoologists also. Intimate contact\r\nwith German students made me feel that I had neglected my\r\nphilosophical education; and when, in the year 1827, the new\r\nUniversity of Munich opened, with Schelling as professor of\r\nphilosophy, Oken, Schubert, and Wagler as professors of zoology,\r\nDollinger as professor of anatomy and physiology, Martius and\r\nZuccarini as professors of botany, Fuchs and Kobell as professors\r\nof mineralogy, I determined to go there with my two friends and\r\ndrink new draughts of knowledge. During the years I passed at\r\nMunich I devoted myself almost exclusively to the different\r\nbranches of natural science, neglecting more and more my medical\r\nstudies, because I began to feel an increasing confidence that I\r\ncould fight my way in the world as a naturalist, and that I was\r\ntherefore justified in following my strong bent in that direction.\r\nMy experience in Munich was very varied. With Dollinger I learned\r\nto value accuracy of observation. As I was living in his house, he\r\ngave me personal instruction in the use of the microscope, and\r\nshowed me his own methods of embryological investigation. He had\r\nalready been the teacher of Karl Ernst von Baer; and though the\r\npupil outran the master, and has become the pride of the scientific\r\nworld, it is but just to remember that he owed to him his first\r\ninitiation into the processes of embryological research. Dollinger\r\nwas a careful, minute, persevering observer, as well as a deep\r\nthinker; but he was as indolent with his pen as he was industrious\r\nwith his brain. He gave his intellectual capital to his pupils\r\nwithout stint or reserve, and nothing delighted him more than to\r\nsit down for a quiet talk on scientific matters with a few\r\nstudents, or to take a ramble with them into the fields outside the\r\ncity, and explain to them as he walked the result of any recent\r\ninvestigation he had made. If he found himself understood by his\r\nlisteners he was satisfied, and cared for no farther publication of\r\nhis researches. I could enumerate many works of masters in our\r\nscience, which had no other foundation at the outset than these\r\ninspiriting conversations. No one has borne warmer testimony to the\r\ninfluence Dollinger has had in this indirect way on the progress of\r\nour science than the investigator I have already mentioned as his\r\ngreatest pupil,--von Baer. In the introduction to his work on\r\nembryology he gratefully acknowledges his debt to his old teacher.\r\n\r\n\"Among the most fascinating of our professors was Oken. A master in\r\nthe art of teaching, he exercised an almost irresistible influence\r\nover his students. Constructing the universe out of his own brain,\r\ndeducing from a priori conceptions all the relations of the three\r\nkingdoms into which he divided all living beings, classifying the\r\nanimals as if by magic, in accordance with an analogy based on the\r\ndismembered body of man, it seemed to us who listened that the slow\r\nlaborious process of accumulating precise detailed knowledge could\r\nonly be the work of drones, while a generous, commanding spirit\r\nmight build the world out of its own powerful imagination. The\r\ntemptation to impose one's own ideas upon nature, to explain her\r\nmysteries by brilliant theories rather than by patient study of the\r\nfacts as we find them, still leads us away. With the school of the\r\nphysio-philosophers began (at least in our day and generation) that\r\noverbearing confidence in the abstract conceptions of the human\r\nmind as applied to the study of nature, which still impairs the\r\nfairness of our classifications and prevents them from interpreting\r\ntruly the natural relations binding together all living beings. And\r\nyet, the young naturalist of that day who did not share, in some\r\ndegree, the intellectual stimulus given to scientific pursuits by\r\nphysio-philosophy would have missed a part of his training. There\r\nis a great distance between the man who, like Oken, attempts to\r\nconstruct the whole system of nature from general premises and the\r\none who, while subordinating his conceptions to the facts, is yet\r\ncapable of generalizing the facts, of recognizing their most\r\ncomprehensive relations. No thoughtful naturalist can silence the\r\nsuggestions, continually arising in the course of his\r\ninvestigations, respecting the origin and deeper connection of all\r\nliving beings; but he is the truest student of nature who, while\r\nseeking the solution of these great problems, admits that the only\r\ntrue scientific system must be one in which the thought, the\r\nintellectual structure, rises out of and is based upon facts. The\r\ngreat merit of the physio-philosophers consisted in their\r\nsuggestiveness. They did much in freeing our age from the low\r\nestimation of natural history as a science which prevailed in the\r\nlast century. They stimulated a spirit of independence among\r\nobservers; but they also instilled a spirit of daring, which, from\r\nits extravagance, has been fatal to the whole school. He is lost,\r\nas an observer, who believes that he can, with impunity, affirm\r\nthat for which he can adduce no evidence. It was a curious\r\nintellectual experience to listen day after day to the lectures of\r\nOken, while following at the same time Schelling's courses, where\r\nhe was shifting the whole ground of his philosophy from its\r\nnegative foundation as an a priori doctrine to a positive basis, as\r\nan historical science. He unfolded his views in a succession of\r\nexquisite lectures, delivered during four consecutive years.\r\n\r\n\"Among my fellow-students were many young men who now rank among\r\nthe highest lights in the various departments of science, and\r\nothers, of equal promise, whose early death cut short their work in\r\nthis world. Some of us had already learned at this time to work for\r\nourselves; not merely to attend lectures and study from books. The\r\nbest spirit of emulation existed among us; we met often to discuss\r\nour observations, undertook frequent excursions in the\r\nneighborhood, delivered lectures to our fellow-students, and had,\r\nnot infrequently, the gratification of seeing our university\r\nprofessors among the listeners. These exercises were of the highest\r\nvalue to me as a preparation for speaking, in later years, before\r\nlarger audiences. My study was usually the lecture-room. It would\r\nhold conveniently from fifteen to twenty persons, and both students\r\nand professors used to call our quarters \"The Little Academy.\" In\r\nthat room I made all the skeletons represented on the plates of\r\nWagler's \"Natural System of Reptiles;\" there I once received the\r\ngreat anatomist, Meckel, sent to me by Dollinger, to examine my\r\nanatomical preparations and especially the many fish-skeletons I\r\nhad made from fresh-water fishes. By my side were constantly at\r\nwork two artists; one engaged in drawing various objects of natural\r\nhistory, the other in drawing fossil fishes. I kept always one and\r\nsometimes two artists in my pay; it was not easy, with an allowance\r\nof 250 dollars a year, but they were even poorer than I, and so we\r\nmanaged to get along together. My microscope I had earned by\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n\"I had hardly finished the publication of the Brazilian Fishes,\r\nwhen I began to study the works of the older naturalists. Professor\r\nDollinger had presented me with a copy of Rondelet, which was my\r\ndelight for a long time. I was especially struck by the naivete of\r\nhis narrative and the minuteness of his descriptions as well as by\r\nthe fidelity of his woodcuts, some of which are to this day the\r\nbest figures we have of the species they represent. His learning\r\noverwhelmed me; I would gladly have read, as he did, everything\r\nthat had been written before my time; but there were authors who\r\nwearied me, and I confess that at that age Linnaeus was among the\r\nnumber. I found him dry, pedantic, dogmatic, conceited; while I was\r\ncharmed with Aristotle, whose zoology I have read and re-read ever\r\nsince at intervals of two or three years. I must, however, do\r\nmyself the justice to add, that after I knew more of the history of\r\nour science I learned also duly to reverence Linnaeus. But a\r\nstudent, already familiar with the works of Cuvier, and but\r\nindifferently acquainted with the earlier progress of zoology,\r\ncould hardly appreciate the merit of the great reformer of natural\r\nhistory. His defects were easily perceived, and it required more\r\nfamiliarity than mine then was with the gradual growth of the\r\nscience, from Aristotle onward, to understand how great and\r\nbeneficial an influence Linnaeus had exerted upon modern natural\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot review my Munich life without deep gratitude. The city\r\nteemed with resources for the student in arts, letters, philosophy,\r\nand science. It was distinguished at that time for activity in\r\npublic as well as in academic life. The king seemed liberal; he was\r\nthe friend of poets and artists, and aimed at concentrating all the\r\nglories of Germany in his new university. I thus enjoyed for a few\r\nyears the example of the most brilliant intellects, and that\r\nstimulus which is given by competition between men equally eminent\r\nin different spheres of human knowledge. Under such circumstances a\r\nman either subsides into the position of a follower in the ranks\r\nthat gather around a master, or he aspires to be a master himself.\r\n\r\n\"The time had come when even the small allowance I received from\r\nborrowed capital must cease. I was now twenty-four years of age. I\r\nwas Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine, and author of a quarto\r\nvolume on the fishes of Brazil. I had traveled on foot all over\r\nSouthern Germany, visited Vienna, and explored extensive tracts of\r\nthe Alps. I knew every animal, living and fossil, in the Museums of\r\nMunich, Stuttgart, Tubingen, Erlangen, Wurzburg, Carlsruhe, and\r\nFrankfort; but my prospects were as dark as ever, and I saw no hope\r\nof making my way in the world, except by the practical pursuit of\r\nmy profession as physician. So, at the close of 1830, I left the\r\nuniversity and went home, with the intention of applying myself to\r\nthe practice of medicine, confident that my theoretical information\r\nand my training in the art of observing would carry me through the\r\nnew ordeal I was about to meet.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n1830-1832: AGE 23-25.\r\n\r\nYear at Home.\r\nLeaves Home for Paris.\r\nDelays on the Road.\r\nCholera.\r\nArrival in Paris.\r\nFirst Visit to Cuvier.\r\nCuvier's Kindness.\r\nHis Death.\r\nPoverty in Paris.\r\nHome Letters concerning Embarrassments and about his Work.\r\nSingular Dream.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, 1830, Agassiz left Munich, in company with\r\nMr. Dinkel, and after a short stay at St. Gallen and Zurich, spent\r\nin looking up fossil fishes and making drawings of them, they\r\nreached Concise on the 30th of the same month. Anxiously as his\r\nreturn was awaited at home, we have seen that his father was not\r\nwithout apprehension lest the presence of the naturalist, with\r\nartist, specimens, and apparatus, should be an inconvenience in the\r\nquiet parsonage. But every obstacle yielded to the joy of reunion,\r\nand Agassiz was soon established with his \"painter,\" his fossils,\r\nand all his scientific outfit, under the paternal roof.\r\n\r\nThus quietly engaged in his ichthyological studies, carrying on his\r\nwork on the fossil fishes, together with that on the fresh-water\r\nfishes of Central Europe, he passed nearly a year at home. He was\r\nnot without patients also in the village and its environs, but had,\r\nas yet, no prospect of permanent professional employment. In the\r\nmean time it seemed daily more and more necessary that he should\r\ncarry his work to Paris, to the great centre of scientific life,\r\nwhere he could have the widest field for comparison and research.\r\nThere, also, he could continue and complete to the best advantage\r\nhis medical studies. His poverty was the greatest hindrance to any\r\nsuch move. He was not, however, without some slight independent\r\nmeans, especially since his publishing arrangements provided in\r\npart for the carrying on of his work. His generous uncle added\r\nsomething to this, and an old friend of his father's, M.\r\nChristinat, a Swiss clergyman with whom he had been from boyhood a\r\ngreat favorite, urged upon him his own contribution toward a work\r\nin which he felt the liveliest interest. Still the prospect with\r\nwhich he left for Paris in September, 1831, was dark enough,\r\nfinancially speaking, though full of hope in another sense. On the\r\nroad he made several halts for purposes of study, combining, as\r\nusual, professional with scientific objects, hospitals with\r\nmuseums. He was, perhaps, a little inclined to believe that the\r\nmost favorable conditions for his medical studies were to be found\r\nin conjunction with the best collections. He had, however, a\r\nspecial medical purpose, being earnest to learn everything\r\nregarding the treatment and the limitation of cholera, then for the\r\nfirst time making its appearance in Western Europe with frightful\r\nvirulence. Believing himself likely to continue the practice of\r\nmedicine for some years at least, he thought his observations upon\r\nthis scourge would be of great importance to him. His letters of\r\nthis date to his father are full of the subject, and of his own\r\nefforts to ascertain the best means of prevention and defense. The\r\nfollowing answer to an appeal from his mother shows, however, that\r\nhis delays caused anxiety at home, lest the small means he could\r\ndevote to his studies in Paris should be consumed on the road.\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nCARLSRUHE, November, 1831.\r\n\r\n. . .I returned day before yesterday from my trip in Wurtemberg,\r\nand though I already knew what precautions had been taken\r\neverywhere in anticipation of cholera, I do not think my journey\r\nwas a useless one, and am convinced that my observations will not\r\nbe without interest,--chiefly for myself, of course, but of utility\r\nto others also I hope. Your letter being so urgent, I will not,\r\nhowever, delay my departure an instant. Between to-day and\r\nto-morrow I shall put in order the specimens lent me by the Museum,\r\nand then start at once. . .In proportion to my previous anxiety is\r\nmy pleasure in the prospect of going to Paris, now that I am better\r\nfitted to present myself there as I could wish. I have collected\r\nfor my fossil fishes all the materials I still desired to obtain\r\nfrom the museums of Carlsruhe, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and have\r\nextended my knowledge of geology sufficiently to join, without\r\nembarrassment at least, in conversation upon the more recent\r\nresearches in that department. Moreover, Braun has been kind enough\r\nto give me a superb collection, selected by himself, to serve as\r\nbasis and guide in my researches. I leave it at Carlsruhe, since I\r\nno longer need it. . .I have also been able to avail myself of the\r\nMuseum of Carlsruhe, and of the mineralogical collection of Braun's\r\nfather. Beside the drawings made by Dinkel, I have added to my work\r\none hundred and seventy-one pages of manuscript in French (I have\r\njust counted them), written between my excursions and in the midst\r\nof other occupations. . .I could not have foreseen so rich a\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, he arrived in Paris with his artist on the 16th of\r\nDecember, 1831. On the 18th he writes to his father. . .\"Dinkel and\r\nI had a very pleasant journey, though the day after our arrival I\r\nwas so fatigued that I could hardly move hand or foot,--that was\r\nyesterday. Nevertheless, I passed the evening very agreeably at the\r\nhouse of M. Cuvier, who sent to invite me, having heard of my\r\narrival. To my surprise, I found myself not quite a stranger,\r\n--rather, as it were, among old acquaintances. I have already given\r\nyou my address, Rue Copeau (Hotel du Jardin du Roi, Numero 4). As\r\nit happens, M. Perrotet, a traveling naturalist, lives here also,\r\nand has at once put me on the right track about whatever I most\r\nneed to know. There are in the house other well-known persons\r\nbesides. I am accommodated very cheaply, and am at the same time\r\nwithin easy reach of many things, the neighborhood of which I can\r\nturn to good account. The medical school, for instance, is within\r\nten minutes' walk; the Jardin des Plantes not two hundred steps\r\naway; while the Hospital (de la Pitie), where Messieurs Andral and\r\nLisfranc teach, is opposite, and nearer still. To-day or to-morrow\r\nI shall deliver my letters, and then set to work in good earnest.\"\r\n\r\nPleased as he was from the beginning with all that concerned his\r\nscientific life in Paris, the next letter shows that the young\r\nSwiss did not at once find himself at home in the great French\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nTO HIS SISTER OLYMPE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 15, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .My expectations in coming here have been more than fulfilled.\r\nIn scientific matters I have found all that I knew must exist in\r\nParis (indeed, my anticipations were rather below than above the\r\nmark), and beside that I have been met everywhere with courtesy,\r\nand have received attentions of all sorts. M. Cuvier and von\r\nHumboldt especially treat me on all occasions as an equal, and\r\nfacilitate for me the use of the scientific collections so that I\r\ncan work here as if I were at home. And yet it is not the same\r\nthing; this extreme, but formal politeness chills you instead of\r\nputting you at your ease; it lacks cordiality, and, to tell the\r\ntruth, I would gladly go away were I not held fast by the wealth of\r\nmaterial of which I can avail myself for instruction. In the\r\nmorning I follow the clinical courses at the Pitie. . .At ten\r\no'clock, or perhaps at eleven, I breakfast, and then go to the\r\nMuseum of Natural History, where I stay till dark. Between five and\r\nsix I dine, and after that turn to such medical studies as do not\r\nrequire daylight. So pass my days, one like another, with great\r\nregularity. I have made it a rule not to go out after dinner,--I\r\nshould lose too much time. . .On Saturday only I spend the evening\r\nat M. Cuvier's. . .\r\n\r\nThe homesickness which is easily to be read between the lines of\r\nthis letter, due, perhaps, to the writer's want of familiarity with\r\nsociety in its conventional aspect, yielded to the influence of an\r\nintellectual life, which became daily more engrossing. Cuvier's\r\nkind reception was but an earnest of the affectionate interest he\r\nseems from the first to have felt in him. After a few days he gave\r\nAgassiz and his artist a corner in one of his own laboratories, and\r\noften came to encourage them by a glance at their work as it went\r\non.\r\n\r\nThis relation continued until Cuvier's death, and Agassiz enjoyed\r\nfor several months the scientific sympathy and personal friendship\r\nof the great master whom he had honored from childhood, and whose\r\nname was ever on his lips till his own work in this world was\r\nclosed. The following letter, written two months later, to his\r\nuncle in Lausanne tells the story in detail.\r\n\r\nTO DR. MAYOR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 16, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .I have also a piece of good news to communicate, which will, I\r\nhope, lead to very favorable results for me. I think I told you\r\nwhen I left for Paris that my chief anxiety was lest I might not be\r\nallowed to examine, and still less to describe, the fossil fishes\r\nand their skeletons in the Museum. Knowing that Cuvier intended to\r\nwrite a work on this subject, I supposed that he would reserve\r\nthese specimens for himself. I half thought he might, on seeing my\r\nwork so far advanced, propose to me to finish it jointly with him,\r\n--but even this I hardly dared to hope. It was on this account,\r\nwith the view of increasing my materials and having thereby a\r\nbetter chance of success with M. Cuvier, that I desired so\r\nearnestly to stop at Strasbourg and Carlsruhe, where I knew\r\nspecimens were to be seen which would have a direct bearing on my\r\naim. The result has far surpassed my expectation. I hastened to\r\nshow my material to M. Cuvier the very day after my arrival. He\r\nreceived me with great politeness, though with a certain reserve,\r\nand immediately gave me permission to see everything in the\r\ngalleries of the Museum. But as I knew that he had put together in\r\nprivate collections all that could be of use to himself in writing\r\nhis book, and as he had never said a word to me of his plan of\r\npublication, I remained in a painful state of doubt, since the\r\ncompletion of his work would have destroyed all chance for the sale\r\nof mine. Last Saturday I was passing the evening there, and we were\r\ntalking of science, when he desired his secretary to bring him a\r\ncertain portfolio of drawings. He showed me the contents; they were\r\ndrawings of fossil fishes and notes which he had taken in the\r\nBritish Museum and elsewhere. After looking it through with me, he\r\nsaid he had seen with satisfaction the manner in which I had\r\ntreated this subject; that I had indeed anticipated him, since he\r\nhad intended at some future time to do the same thing; but that as\r\nI had given it so much attention, and had done my work so well, he\r\nhad decided to renounce his project, and to place at my disposition\r\nall the materials he had collected and all the preliminary notes he\r\nhad taken.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine what new ardor this has given me for my work, the\r\nmore so because M. Cuvier, M. Humboldt, and several other persons\r\nof mark who are interested in it have promised to speak in my\r\nbehalf to a publisher (to Levrault, who seems disposed to undertake\r\nthe publication should peace be continued), and to recommend me\r\nstrongly. To accomplish my end without neglecting other\r\noccupations, I work regularly at least fifteen hours a day,\r\nsometimes even an hour or two more; but I hope to reach my goal in\r\ngood time.\r\n\r\nThis trust from Cuvier proved to be a legacy. Less than three\r\nmonths after the date of this letter Agassiz went, as often\r\nhappened, to work one morning with him in his study. It was Sunday,\r\nand he was employed upon something which Cuvier had asked him to\r\ndo, saying, \"You are young; you have time enough for it, and I have\r\nnone to spare.\" They worked together till eleven o'clock, when\r\nCuvier invited Agassiz to join him at breakfast. After a little\r\ntime spent over the breakfast table in talk with the ladies of the\r\nfamily, while Cuvier opened his letters, papers, etc., they\r\nreturned to the working room, and were busily engaged in their\r\nseparate occupations when Agassiz was surprised to hear the clock\r\nstrike five, the hour for his dinner. He expressed his regret that\r\nhe had not quite finished his work, but said that as he belonged to\r\na student's table his dinner would not wait for him, and he would\r\nreturn soon to complete his task. Cuvier answered that he was quite\r\nright not to neglect his regular hours for meals, and commended his\r\ndevotion to study, but added, \"Be careful, and remember that WORK\r\nKILLS.\" They were the last words he heard from his beloved teacher.\r\nThe next day, as Cuvier was going up to the tribune in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies, he fell, was taken up paralyzed, and carried home.\r\nAgassiz never saw him again.* (* This warning of Cuvier, \"Work\r\nkills,\" strangely recalls Johannes Muller's \"Blood clings to work;\"\r\nthe one seems the echo of the other. See \"Memoir of Johannes\r\nMuller\", by Rudolf Virchow, page 38.)\r\n\r\nIn order to keep intact these few data respecting his personal\r\nrelations with Cuvier, as told in later years by Agassiz himself,\r\nthe course of the narrative has been anticipated by a month or two.\r\nLet us now return to the natural order. The letter to his uncle of\r\ncourse gave great pleasure at home. Just after reading it his\r\nfather writes (February, 1832), \"Now that you are intrusted with\r\nthe portfolio of M. Cuvier, I suppose your plan is considerably\r\nenlarged, and that your work will be of double volume; tell me,\r\nthen, as much about it as you think I can understand, which will\r\nnot be a great deal after all.\" His mother's letter on the same\r\noccasion is full of tender sympathy and gratitude.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one daily anxiety embittered his scientific happiness.\r\nThe small means at his command could hardly be made, even with the\r\nstrictest economy, to cover the necessary expenses of himself and\r\nhis artist, in which were included books, drawing materials, fees,\r\netc. He was in constant terror lest he should be obliged to leave\r\nParis, to give up his investigations on the fossil fishes, and to\r\nstop work on the costly plates he had begun. The truth about his\r\naffairs, which he would gladly have concealed from those at home as\r\nlong as possible, was drawn from him by an accidental occurrence.\r\nHis brother had written to him for a certain book, and, failing to\r\nreceive it, inquired with some surprise why his commission was\r\nneglected. Agassiz's next letter, about a month later than the one\r\nto his uncle, gives the explanation.\r\n\r\nTO HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .Here is the book for which you asked me,--price, 18 francs. I\r\nshall be very sorry if it comes too late, but I could not help it\r\n. . .In the first place I had not money enough to pay for it\r\nwithout being left actually penniless. You can imagine that after\r\nthe fuel bill for the winter is paid, little remains for other\r\nexpenses out of my 200 francs a month, five louis of which are\r\nalways due to my companion. Far from having anything in advance, my\r\nmonth's supply is thus taken up at once. . .Beside this cause of\r\ndelay, you can have no idea what it is to hunt for anything in Paris\r\nwhen you are a stranger there. As I go out only in two or three\r\ndirections leading to my work, and might not otherwise leave my own\r\nstreet for a month at a time, I naturally find myself astray when\r\nI am off this beaten track. . .You have asked me several times how\r\nI have been received by those to whom I had introductions. Frankly,\r\nafter having delivered a few of my letters, I have never been\r\nagain, because I cannot, in my position, spare time for visits. . .\r\nAnother excellent reason for staying away now is that I have\r\nno presentable coat. At M. Cuvier's only am I sufficiently at ease\r\nto go in a frock coat. . .Saturday, a week ago, M. de Ferussac\r\noffered me the editorship of the zoological section of the\r\n\"Bulletin;\" it would be worth to me an additional thousand francs,\r\nbut would require two or three hours' work daily. Write me soon\r\nwhat you think about it. In the midst of all the encouragements\r\nwhich sustain me and renew my ardor, I am depressed by the reverse\r\nside of my position.\r\n\r\nThis letter drew forth the following one.\r\n\r\nFROM HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nCONCISE, March, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .Much as your letter to your uncle delighted us, that to your\r\nbrother has saddened us. It seems, my dear child, that you are\r\npainfully straitened in means. I understand it by personal\r\nexperience, and in your case I have foreseen it; it is the cloud\r\nwhich has always darkened your prospects to me. I want to talk to\r\nyou, my dear Louis, of your future, which has often made me\r\nanxious. You know your mother's heart too well to misunderstand her\r\nthought, even should its expression be unacceptable to you. With\r\nmuch knowledge, acquired by assiduous industry, you are still at\r\ntwenty-five years of age living on brilliant hopes, in relation, it\r\nis true, with great people, and known as having distinguished\r\ntalent. Now, all this would seem to me delightful if you had an\r\nincome of fifty thousand francs; but, in your position, you must\r\nabsolutely have an occupation which will enable you to live, and\r\nfree you from the insupportable weight of dependence on others.\r\nFrom this day forward, my dear child, you must look to this end\r\nalone if you would find it possible to pursue honorably the career\r\nyou have chosen. Otherwise constant embarrassments will so limit\r\nyour genius, that you will fall below your own capacity. If you\r\nfollow our advice you will perhaps reach the result of your work in\r\nthe natural sciences a little later, but all the more surely. Let\r\nus see how you can combine the work to which you have already\r\nconsecrated so much time, with the possibility of self-support. It\r\nappears from your letter to your brother that you see no one in\r\nParis; the reason seems to me a sad one, but it is unanswerable,\r\nand since you cannot change it, you must change your place of abode\r\nand return to your own country. You have already seen in Paris all\r\nthose persons whom you thought it essential to see; unless you are\r\nstrangely mistaken in their good-will, you will be no less sure of\r\nit in Switzerland than in Paris, and since you cannot take part in\r\ntheir society, your relations with them will be the same at the\r\ndistance of a hundred leagues as they are now. You must therefore\r\nleave Paris for Geneva, Lausanne, or Neuchatel, or any city where\r\nyou can support yourself by teaching. . .This seems to me the most\r\nadvantageous course for you. If before fixing yourself permanently\r\nyou like to take your place at the parsonage again, you will always\r\nfind us ready to facilitate, as far as we can, any arrangements for\r\nyour convenience. Here you can live in perfect tranquillity and\r\nwithout expense.\r\n\r\nThere are two other subjects which I want to discuss with you,\r\nthough perhaps I shall not make myself so easily understood. You\r\nhave seen the handsome public building in process of construction\r\nat Neuchatel. It will be finished this year, and I am told that the\r\nMuseum will be placed there. I believe the collections are very\r\nincomplete, and the city of Neuchatel is rich enough to expend\r\nsomething in filling the blanks. It has occurred to me, my dear,\r\nthat this would be an excellent opportunity for disposing of your\r\nalcoholic specimens. They form, at present, a capital yielding no\r\ninterest, requiring care, and to be enjoyed only at the cost of\r\nendless outlay in glass jars, alcohol, and transportation, to say\r\nnothing of the rent of a room in which to keep them. All this,\r\nbeside attracting many visitors, is too heavy a burden for you,\r\nfrom which you may free yourself by taking advantage of this rare\r\nchance. To this end you must have an immediate understanding with\r\nM. Coulon, lest he should make a choice elsewhere. Your brother,\r\nbeing on the spot, might negotiate for you. . .Finally, my last\r\ntopic is Mr. Dinkel. You are very fortunate to have found in your\r\nartist such a thoroughly nice fellow; nevertheless, in view of the\r\nexpense, you must make it possible to do without him. I see you\r\nlook at me aghast; but where a sacrifice is to be made we must not\r\ndo it by halves; we must pull up the tree by the roots. It is a\r\ngreat evil to be spending more than one earns. . .\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March 25, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .It is true, dear mother, that I am greatly straitened; that I\r\nhave much less money to spend than I could wish, or even than I\r\nneed; on the other hand, this makes me work the harder, and keeps\r\nme away from distractions which might otherwise tempt me. . .With\r\nreference to my work, however, things are not quite as you suppose,\r\nas regards either my stay here or my relations with M. Cuvier.\r\nCertainly, I hope that I should lose neither his good-will nor his\r\nprotection on leaving here; on the contrary, I am sure that he\r\nwould be the first to advise me to accept any professorship, or any\r\nplace which might be advantageous for me, however removed from my\r\npresent occupations, and that his counsels would follow me there.\r\nBut what cannot follow me, and what I owe quite as much to him, is\r\nthe privilege of examining all the collections. These I can have\r\nnowhere but in Paris, since even if he would consent to it I could\r\nnot carry away with me a hundred quintals of fossil fish, which,\r\nfor the sake of comparison, I must have before my eyes, nor\r\nthousands of fish-skeletons, which would alone fill some fifty\r\ngreat cases. It is this which compels me to stay here till I have\r\nfinished my work. I should add that M. Elie de Beaumont has also\r\nbeen kind enough to place at my disposition the fossil fishes from\r\nthe collection at the Mining School, and that M. Brongniart has\r\nmade me the same offer regarding his collection, which is one of\r\nthe finest among those owned by individuals in Paris. . .\r\n\r\nAs to my collections, I had already thought of asking either the\r\nVaudois government or the city of Neuchatel to receive them into\r\nthe Museum, merely on condition that they should provide for the\r\nexpenses of exhibition and preservation, making use of them,\r\nmeanwhile, for the instruction of the public. I should be sorry to\r\nlose all right to them, because I hope they may have another final\r\ndestination. I do not despair of seeing the different parts of\r\nSwitzerland united at some future day by a closer tie, and in case\r\nof such a union a truly Helvetic university would become a\r\nnecessity; then, my aim would be to make my collection the basis of\r\nthat which they would be obliged to found for their courses of\r\nlectures. It is really a shame that Switzerland, richer and more\r\nextensive than many a small kingdom, should have no university,\r\nwhen some states of not half its size have even two; for instance,\r\nthe grand duchy of Baden, one of whose universities, that of\r\nHeidelberg, ranks among the first in all Germany. If ever I attain\r\na position allowing me so to do, I shall make every effort in my\r\npower to procure for my country the greatest of benefits: namely,\r\nthat of an intellectual unity, which can arise only from a high\r\ndegree of civilization, and from the radiation of knowledge from\r\none central point.\r\n\r\nI, too, have considered the question about Dinkel, and if, when I\r\nhave finished my work here, my position is not changed, and I have\r\nno definite prospect, such as would justify me in keeping him with\r\nme,--well! then we must part! I have long been preparing myself for\r\nthis, by employing him only upon what is indispensable to the\r\npublication of my first numbers, hoping that these may procure me\r\nthe means of paying for such illustrations as I shall further need.\r\nAs my justification for having engaged him in the first instance,\r\nand continued this expense till now, I can truly say that it is in\r\na great degree through his drawings that M. Cuvier has been able to\r\njudge of my work, and so has been led to make a surrender of all\r\nhis materials in my favor. I foresaw clearly that this was my only\r\nchance of competing with him, and it was not without reason that I\r\ninsisted so strongly on having Dinkel with me in passing through\r\nStrasbourg and subsequently at Carlsruhe. Had I not done so, M.\r\nCuvier might still be in advance of me. Now my mind is at rest on\r\nthis score; I have already written you all about his kindness in\r\noffering me the work. Could I only be equally fortunate in its\r\npublication!\r\n\r\nM. Cuvier urges me strongly to present my book to the Academy, in\r\norder to obtain a report upon its contents. I must first finish it,\r\nhowever, and the task is not a light one. For this reason, above\r\nall, I regret my want of means; but for that I could have the\r\ndrawings made at once, and the Academy report, considered as a\r\nrecommendation, would certainly help on the publication greatly.\r\nBut in this respect I have long been straitened; Auguste knows that\r\nI had at Munich an artist who was to complete what I had left there\r\nfor execution, and that I stopped his work on leaving Concise. If\r\nthe stagnation of the book-trade continues I shall, perhaps, be\r\nforced to give up Dinkel also; for if I cannot begin the\r\npublication, which will, I hope, bring me some return, I must cease\r\nto accumulate material in advance. Should business revive soon,\r\nhowever, I may yet have the pleasure of seeing all completed before\r\nI leave Paris.\r\n\r\nI think I forgot to mention the arrival of Braun six weeks after\r\nme. I had a double pleasure in his coming, for he brought with him\r\nhis younger brother, a charming fellow, and a distinguished pupil\r\nof the polytechnic school of Carlsruhe. He means to be a mining\r\nengineer, and comes to study such collections at Paris as are\r\nconnected with this branch. You cannot imagine what happiness and\r\ncomfort I have in my relations with Alexander; he is so good, so\r\ncultivated and high-minded, that his friendship is a real blessing\r\nto me. We both feel very much our separation from the elder\r\nSchimper, who, spite of his great desire to join us at Carlsruhe\r\nand accompany us to Paris, was not able to leave Munich. . .\r\n\r\nP.S. My love to Auguste. To-day (Sunday) I went again to see M.\r\nHumboldt about Auguste's* (* Concerning a business undertaking in\r\nMexico.) plan, but did not find him.\r\n\r\nThen follow several pages, addressed to his father, in answer to\r\nthe request contained in one of his last letters that Louis would\r\ntell him as much as he thinks he can understand of his work. There\r\nis something touching in this little lesson given by the son to the\r\nfather, as showing with what delight Louis responded to the least\r\ntouch of parental affection respecting his favorite studies, so\r\nlong looked upon at home with a certain doubt and suspicion. The\r\nwhole letter is not given here, as it is simply an elementary\r\ntreatise on geology; but the close is not without interest as\r\nrelating to the special investigations on which he was now\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\"The aim of our researches upon fossil animals is to ascertain what\r\nbeings have lived at each one of these (geological) epochs of\r\ncreation, and to trace their characters and their relations with\r\nthose now living; in one word, to make them live again in our\r\nthought. It is especially the fishes that I try to restore for the\r\neyes of the curious, by showing them which ones have lived in each\r\nepoch, what were their forms, and, if possible, by drawing some\r\nconclusions as to their probable modes of life. You will better\r\nunderstand the difficulty of my work when I tell you that in many\r\nspecies I have only a single tooth, a scale, a spine, as my guide\r\nin the reconstruction of all these characters, although sometimes\r\nwe are fortunate enough to find species with the fins and the\r\nskeletons complete. . .\r\n\r\n\"I ask pardon if I have tired you with my long talk, but you know\r\nhow pleasant it is to ramble on about what interests us, and the\r\npleasure of being questioned by you upon subjects of this kind has\r\nbeen such a rare one for me, that I have wished to present the\r\nmatter in its full light, that you may understand the zeal and the\r\nenthusiasm which such researches can excite.\"\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs a curious dream mentioned by Agassiz in his\r\nwork on the fossil fishes.* (* \"Recherches sur les Poissons\r\nFossiles\". Cyclopoma spinosum Agassiz. Volume 4 tab 1, pages 20,\r\n21.) It is interesting both as a psychological fact and as showing\r\nhow, sleeping and waking, his work was ever present with him. He\r\nhad been for two weeks striving to decipher the somewhat obscure\r\nimpression of a fossil fish on the stone slab in which it was\r\npreserved. Weary and perplexed he put his work aside at last, and\r\ntried to dismiss it from his mind. Shortly after, he waked one\r\nnight persuaded that while asleep he had seen his fish with all the\r\nmissing features perfectly restored. But when he tried to hold and\r\nmake fast the image, it escaped him. Nevertheless, he went early to\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes, thinking that on looking anew at the\r\nimpression he should see something which would put him on the track\r\nof his vision. In vain,--the blurred record was as blank as ever.\r\nThe next night he saw the fish again, but with no more satisfactory\r\nresult. When he awoke it disappeared from his memory as before.\r\nHoping that the same experience might be repeated, on the third\r\nnight he placed a pencil and paper beside his bed before going to\r\nsleep. Accordingly toward morning the fish reappeared in his dream,\r\nconfusedly at first, but at last with such distinctness that he had\r\nno longer any doubt as to its zoological characters. Still half\r\ndreaming, in perfect darkness, he traced these characters on the\r\nsheet of paper at the bedside. In the morning he was surprised to\r\nsee in his nocturnal sketch features which he thought it impossible\r\nthe fossil itself should reveal. He hastened to the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, and, with his drawing as a guide, succeeded in chiseling\r\naway the surface of the stone under which portions of the fish\r\nproved to be hidden. When wholly exposed it corresponded with his\r\ndream and his drawing, and he succeeded in classifying it with\r\nease. He often spoke of this as a good illustration of the\r\nwell-known fact, that when the body is at rest the tired brain will\r\ndo the work it refused before.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n1832: AGE 25.\r\n\r\nUnexpected Relief from Difficulties.\r\nCorrespondence with Humboldt.\r\nExcursion to the Coast of Normandy.\r\nFirst Sight of the Sea.\r\nCorrespondence concerning Professorship at Neuchatel.\r\nBirthday Fete.\r\nInvitation to Chair of Natural History at Neuchatel.\r\nAcceptance.\r\nLetter to Humboldt.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ was not called upon to make the sacrifice of giving up his\r\nartist and leaving Paris, although he was, or at least thought\r\nhimself, prepared for it. The darkest hour is before the dawn, and\r\nthe letter next given announces an unexpected relief from pressing\r\ndistress and anxiety.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .I am still so agitated and so surprised at what has just\r\nhappened that I scarcely believe what my eyes tell me.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in a postscript to my last letter that I had called\r\nyesterday on M. de Humboldt, whom I had not seen for a long time,\r\nin order to speak to him concerning Auguste's affair, but that I\r\ndid not find him. In former visits I had spoken to him about my\r\nposition, and told him that I did not well know what course to take\r\nwith my publisher. He offered to write to him, and did so more than\r\ntwo months ago. Thus far, neither he nor I have had any answer.\r\nThis morning, just as I was going out, a letter came from M. de\r\nHumboldt, who writes me that he is very uneasy at receiving no\r\nreply from Cotta, that he fears lest the uncertainty and anxiety of\r\nmind resulting from this may be injurious to my work, and begs me\r\nto accept the inclosed credit of a thousand francs. . .--Oh! if my\r\nmother would forget for one moment that this is the celebrated M.\r\nde Humboldt, and find courage to write him only a few lines, how\r\ngrateful I should be to her. I think it would come better from her\r\nthan from papa, who would do it more correctly, no doubt, but\r\nperhaps not quite as I should like. Humboldt is so good, so\r\nindulgent, that you should not hesitate, dear mother, to write him\r\na few lines. He lives Rue du Colombier, Number 22; address, quite\r\nsimply, M. de Humboldt. . .\r\n\r\nIn the agitation of the moment the letter was not even signed.\r\n\r\nThe following note from Humboldt to Mme. Agassiz, kept by her as a\r\nprecious possession, shows that in answer to her son's appeal his\r\nmother took her courage, as the French saying is, \"with both\r\nhands,\" and wrote as she was desired.\r\n\r\nFROM HUMBOLDT TO MME. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, April 11, 1832.\r\n\r\nI should scold your son, Madame, for having spoken to you of the\r\nslight mark of interest I have been able to show him; and yet, how\r\ncan I complain of a letter so touching, so noble in sentiment, as\r\nthe one I have just received from your hand. Accept my warmest\r\nthanks for it. How happy you are to have a son so distinguished by\r\nhis talents, by the variety and solidity of his acquirements, and,\r\nwithal, as modest as if he knew nothing,--in these days, too, when\r\nyouth is generally characterized by a cold and scornful\r\namour-propre. One might well despair of the world if a person like\r\nyour son, with information so substantial and manners so sweet and\r\nprepossessing, should fail to make his way. I approve highly the\r\nNeuchatel plan, and hope, in case of need, to contribute to its\r\nsuccess. One must aim at a settled position in life.\r\n\r\nPray excuse, Madame, the brevity of these lines, and accept the\r\nassurance of my respectful regard.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nThe letter which lifted such a load of care from Louis and his\r\nparents was as follows:--\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March 27, 1832.\r\n\r\nI am very uneasy, my dearest M. Agassiz, at being still without any\r\nletter from Cotta. Has he been prevented from writing by business,\r\nor illness perhaps? You know how tardy he always is about writing.\r\nYesterday (Monday) I wrote him earnestly again concerning your\r\naffair (an undertaking of such moment for science), and urged upon\r\nhim the issuing of the fossil and fresh-water fishes in alternate\r\nnumbers. In the mean time, I fear that the protracted delay may\r\nweigh heavily on you and your friends. A man so laborious, so\r\ngifted, and so deserving of affection as you are should not be left\r\nin a position where lack of serenity disturbs his power of work.\r\nYou will then surely pardon my friendly goodwill toward you, my\r\ndear M. Agassiz, if I entreat you to make use of the accompanying\r\nsmall credit. You would do more for me I am sure. Consider it an\r\nadvance which need not be paid for years, and which I will gladly\r\nincrease when I go away or even earlier. It would pain me deeply\r\nshould the urgency of my request made in the closest confidence,\r\n--in short, a transaction as between two friends of unequal age,\r\n--be disagreeable to you. I should wish to be pleasantly remembered\r\nby a young man of your character.\r\n\r\nYours, with the most affectionate respect,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nWith this letter was found the following note of acknowledgment,\r\nscrawled in almost illegible pencil marks. Whether sent exactly as\r\nit stands or not, it is evidently the first outburst of Agassiz's\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nMy benefactor and friend,--it is too much; I cannot find words to\r\ntell you how deeply your letter of to-day has moved me. I have just\r\nbeen at your house that I might thank you in person with all my\r\nheart; but now I must wait to do so until I have the good fortune\r\nto meet you. At what a moment does your help come to me! I inclose\r\na letter from my dear mother that you may understand my whole\r\nposition. My parents will now readily consent that I should devote\r\nmyself entirely to science, and I am freed from the distressing\r\nthought that I may be acting contrary to their wishes and their\r\nwill. But they have not the means to help me, and had proposed that\r\nI should return to Switzerland and give lessons either in Geneva or\r\nLausanne. I had already resolved to follow this suggestion in the\r\ncourse of next summer, and had also decided to part with Mr.\r\nDinkel, my faithful companion, as soon as he should have finished\r\nthe most indispensable drawings of the fossils on which he is now\r\nengaged here. I meant to tell you of this on Sunday, and now to-day\r\ncomes your letter. Imagine what must have been my feeling, after\r\nhaving resolved on renouncing what till now had seemed to me\r\nnoblest and most desirable in life, to find myself unexpectedly\r\nrescued by a kind, helpful hand, and to have again the hope of\r\ndevoting my whole powers to science,--you can judge of the state\r\ninto which your letter has thrown me. . .\r\n\r\nSoon after this event Agassiz made a short excursion with Braun and\r\nDinkel to the coast of Normandy; worth noting, because he now saw\r\nthe sea for the first time. He wrote home: \"For five days we\r\nskirted the coast from Havre to Dieppe; at last I have looked upon\r\nthe sea and its riches. From this excursion of a few days, which I\r\nhad almost despaired of making, I bring back new ideas, more\r\ncomprehensive views, and a more accurate knowledge of the great\r\nphenomena presented by the ocean in its vast expanse.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hope he had always entertained of finding a\r\nprofessorship of natural history in his own country was ripening\r\ninto a definite project. His first letter on this subject to M.\r\nLouis Coulon, himself a well-known naturalist, and afterward one of\r\nhis warmest friends in Neuchatel, must have been written just\r\nbefore he received from Humboldt the note of the same date, which\r\nextricated him from his pecuniary embarrassment.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO LOUIS COULON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March 27, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .When I had the pleasure of seeing you last summer I several\r\ntimes expressed my strong desire to establish myself near you, and\r\nmy intention of taking some steps toward obtaining the\r\nprofessorship of natural history to be founded in your Lyceum. The\r\nmatter must be more advanced now than it was last year, and you\r\nwould oblige me greatly by giving me some information concerning\r\nit. I have spoken of my project to M. de Humboldt, whom I often\r\nsee, and who kindly interests himself about my prospects and helps\r\nme with his advice. He thinks that under the circumstances, and\r\nespecially in my position, measures should be taken in advance.\r\nThere is another point of great importance for me about which I\r\nwished also to speak to you. Though you have seen but a small part\r\nof it, you nevertheless know that in my different journeys, partly\r\nthrough my relations with other naturalists, partly by exchange, I\r\nhave made a very fair collection of natural history, especially\r\nrich in just those classes which are less fully represented in your\r\nmuseum. My collection might, therefore, fill the gaps in that of\r\nthe city of Neuchatel, and make the latter more than adequate for\r\nthe illustration of a full course of natural history. Should an\r\nincrease of your zoological collection make part of your plans for\r\nthe Lyceum, I venture to believe that mine would fully answer your\r\npurpose. In that case I would offer it to you, since the expense of\r\narranging it, the rent of a room in which to keep it, and, in\r\nshort, its support in general, is beyond my means. I must find some\r\nway of relieving myself from this burden, although it will be hard\r\nto part with these companions of my study, upon which I have based\r\nalmost all my investigations. I have spoken of this also to M. de\r\nHumboldt, who is good enough to show an interest in the matter, and\r\nwill even take all necessary steps with the government to\r\nfacilitate this purchase. You would render me the greatest service\r\nby giving me your directions about all this, and especially by\r\ntelling me: 1. On whom the nomination to the professorship depends?\r\n2. With whom the purchase of the collection would rest? 3. What you\r\nthink I should do with reference to both? Of course you will easily\r\nunderstand that I cannot give up my collections except under the\r\ncondition that I should be allowed the free use of them. . .\r\n\r\nThe answer was not only courteous, but kind, although some time\r\nelapsed before the final arrangements were made. Meanwhile the\r\nfollowing letter shows us the doubts and temptations which for a\r\nmoment embarrassed Agassiz in his decision. The death of Cuvier had\r\nintervened.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nPARIS, May, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .I would not write you until I had definite news from\r\nNeuchatel. Two days ago I received a very delightful letter from M.\r\nCoulon, which I hasten to share with you. I will not copy the\r\nwhole, but extract the essential part. He tells me that he has\r\nproposed to the Board of Education the establishment of a\r\nprofessorship of natural history, to be offered to me. The\r\nproposition met with a cordial hearing. The need of such a\r\nprofessorship was unanimously recognized, but the President\r\nexplained that neither would the condition of the treasury allow\r\nits establishment in the present year, nor could the proposition be\r\nbrought before the Council of State until the opening of the new\r\nLyceum.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Coulon was commissioned to thank me, and to request me in\r\nthe name of the board to keep the place in mind; should I prefer\r\nit, however, he doubts not that whatever the city could not do\r\nmight be made good by subscription before next autumn, in which\r\ncase I could enter upon office at once. He requests a prompt answer\r\nin order that he may make all needful preparations. Only too gladly\r\nwould I have consulted you about various propositions made to me\r\nhere in the last few days, and have submitted my course to your\r\napproval, had it not been that here, as in Neuchatel, a prompt\r\nanswer was urged. Although guided rather by instinct than by\r\nanything else, I think, nevertheless, that I have chosen rightly.\r\nIn such moments, when one cannot see far enough in advance to form\r\nan accurate judgment upon deliberation, feeling is, after all, the\r\nbest adviser; that inner impulse, which is a safe guide if other\r\nconsiderations do not confuse the judgment. This says to me, \"Go to\r\nNeuchatel; do not stay in Paris.\" But I speak in riddles; I must\r\nexplain myself more clearly. Last Monday Levrault sent for me in\r\norder to propose that Valenciennes and I should jointly undertake\r\nthe publication of the Cuvierian fishes. . .I was to give a\r\npositive answer this week. I have carefully considered it, and have\r\ndecided that an unconditional engagement would lead me away from my\r\nnearest aim, and from what I look upon as the task of my life. The\r\nalready published volumes of the System of Ichthyology lie too far\r\nfrom the road on which I intend to pursue my researches. Finally,\r\nit seems to me that in a quiet retired place like Neuchatel,\r\nwhatever may be growing up within me will have a more independent\r\nand individual development than in this restless Paris, where\r\nobstacles or difficulties may not perhaps divert me from a given\r\npurpose, but may disturb or delay its accomplishment. I will\r\ntherefore so shape my answer to Levrault as to undertake only\r\nsingle portions of the work, the choice of these, on account of my\r\ninterest in the fossil and the fresh-water fishes, being allowed\r\nme, with the understanding, also, that I should be permitted to\r\nhave these collections in Switzerland and work them up there. From\r\nParis, also, it would not be so easy to transfer myself to Germany,\r\nwhereas I could consider Neuchatel as a provisional position from\r\nwhich I might be called to a German university. . .\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while waiting hopefully the result of his\r\nnegotiations with Neuchatel, Agassiz had organized with his\r\nfriends, the two Brauns, a bachelor life very like the one he and\r\nAlexander had led with their classmates in Munich. The little hotel\r\nwhere they lodged had filled up with young German doctors, who had\r\ncome to visit the hospitals in Paris and study the cholera. Some of\r\nthese young men had been their fellow-students at the university,\r\nand at their request Agassiz and Braun resumed the practice of\r\ngiving private lectures on zoology and botany, the whole being\r\nconducted in the most informal manner, admitting absolute freedom\r\nof discussion, as among intimate companions of the same age. Such\r\nan interchange naturally led to very genial relations between the\r\namateur professors and their class, and on the eve of Agassiz's\r\nbirthday (28th of May) his usual audience prepared for him a very\r\npleasant surprise. Returning from a walk after dusk he found Braun\r\nin his room. Continuing his stroll within four walls, he and his\r\nfriend paced the floor together in earnest talk, when, at a signal,\r\nBraun suddenly drew him to the window, threw it open, and on the\r\npavement below stood their companions, singing a part song,\r\ncomposed in honor of Agassiz. Deeply moved, he withdrew from the\r\nwindow in time to receive them as they trooped up the stairway to\r\noffer their good wishes. They presently led the way to another room\r\nwhich they had dressed with flowers, Agassiz's name, among other\r\ndecorations, being braided in roses beneath two federal flags\r\ncrossed on the wall. Here supper was laid, and the rest of the\r\nevening passed gayly with songs and toasts, not only for the hero\r\nof the feast and for friends far and near, but for the progress of\r\nscience, the liberty of the people, and the independence of\r\nnations. There could be no meeting of ardent young Germans and\r\nSwiss in those days without some mingling of patriotic aspirations\r\nwith the sentiment of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe friendly correspondence between Agassiz and M. Coulon regarding\r\nthe professorship at Neuchatel was now rapidly bringing the matter\r\nto a happy conclusion.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO LOUIS COULON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 4, 1832.\r\n\r\nI have received your kind letter with great pleasure and hasten to\r\nreply. What you write gives me the more satisfaction because it\r\nopens to me in the near future the hope of establishing myself in\r\nyour neighborhood and devoting to my country the fruits of my\r\nlabor. It is true, as you suppose, that the death of M. Cuvier has\r\nsensibly changed my position; indeed, I have already been asked to\r\ncontinue his work on fishes in connection with M. Valenciennes, who\r\nmade me this proposition the day after your letter reached me. The\r\nconditions offered me are, indeed, very tempting, but I am too\r\nlittle French by character, and too anxious to live in Switzerland,\r\nnot to prefer the place you can offer me, however small the\r\nappointments, if they do but keep me above actual embarrassment. I\r\nsay thus much only in order to answer that clause in your letter\r\nwhere you touch upon this question. I would add that I leave the\r\nfield quite free in this respect, and that I am yours without\r\nreserve, if, indeed, within the fortnight, the urgency of the\r\nParisians does not carry the day, or, rather, as soon as I write\r\nyou that I have been able finally to withdraw. You easily\r\nunderstand that I cannot bluntly decline offers which seem to those\r\nwho make them so brilliant. But I shall hold out against them to\r\nthe utmost. My course with reference to my own publications will\r\nhave shown you that I do not care for a lucrative position from\r\npersonal interest; that, on the contrary, I should always be ready\r\nto use such means as I may have at my disposition for the\r\nadvancement of the institution confided to my care.\r\n\r\nMy work will still detain me for four or five months at Paris,--my\r\ntime being after that completely at my disposal. The period at\r\nwhich I should like to begin my lectures is therefore very near,\r\nand I think if your people are favorably disposed toward the\r\ncreation of a new professorship we must not let them grow cold. But\r\nyou have shown me so much kindness that I may well leave to your\r\ncare, in concert with your friends, the decision of this point; the\r\nmore so since you are willing to take charge of my interests, until\r\nyou see the success of what you are pleased to look upon as an\r\nadvantage to your institution, while for me it is the realization\r\nof a sincere desire to do what I can for the advancement of\r\nscience, and the instruction of our youth. . .\r\n\r\nThe next letter from M. Coulon (June 18, 1832) announces that the\r\nsum of eighty louis having been guaranteed for three years, chiefly\r\nby private individuals, but partly also by the city, they were now\r\nable to offer a chair of natural history at once to their young\r\ncountryman. In conclusion, he adds:--\r\n\r\n\"I can easily understand that the brilliant offers made you in\r\nParis strongly counterbalance a poor little professorship of\r\nnatural history at Neuchatel, and may well cause you to hesitate;\r\nespecially since your scientific career there is so well begun. On\r\nthe other hand, you cannot doubt our pleasure in the prospect of\r\nhaving you at Neuchatel, not only because of the friendship felt\r\nfor you by many persons here, but also on account of the lustre\r\nwhich a chair of natural history so filled would shed upon our\r\ninstitution. Of this our subscribers are well aware, and it\r\naccounts for the rapid filling of the list. I am very anxious, as\r\nare all these gentlemen, to know your decision, and beg you\r\ntherefore to let us hear from you as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Humboldt to M. Coulon, about this time, is an earnest\r\nof his watchful care over the interests of Agassiz.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO LOUIS COULON.\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, July 25, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .I do not write to ask a favor, but only to express my warm\r\ngratitude for your noble and generous dealings with the young\r\nsavant, M. Agassiz, who is well worthy your encouragement and the\r\nprotection of your government. He is distinguished by his talents,\r\nby the variety and substantial character of his attainments, and by\r\nthat which has a special value in these troubled times, his natural\r\nsweetness of disposition.\r\n\r\nThrough our common friend, M. von Buch, I have known for many years\r\nthat you study natural history with a success equal to your zeal,\r\nand that you have brought together fine collections, which you\r\nplace at the disposal of others with a noble liberality. It\r\ngratifies me to see your kindness toward a young man to whom I am\r\nso warmly attached; whom the illustrious Cuvier, also, whose loss\r\nwe must ever deplore, would have recommended with the same\r\nheartiness, for his faith, like mine, was based on those admirable\r\nworks of Agassiz which are now nearly completed. . .\r\n\r\nI have strongly advised M. Agassiz not to accept the offers made to\r\nhim at Paris since M. Cuvier's death, and his decision has\r\nanticipated my advice. How happy it would be for him, and for the\r\ncompletion of the excellent works on which he is engaged, could he\r\nthis very year be established on the shores of your lake! I have no\r\ndoubt that he will receive the powerful protection of your worthy\r\ngovernor, to whom I shall repeat my requests, and who honors me, as\r\nwell as my brother, with a friendship I warmly appreciate. M. von\r\nBuch also has promised me, before leaving Berlin for Bonn and\r\nVienna, to add his entreaty to mine. . .He is almost as much\r\ninterested as myself in M. Agassiz and his work on fossil fishes,\r\nthe most important ever undertaken, and equally exact in its\r\nrelation to zoological characters and to geological deposits. . .\r\n\r\nThe next letter from Agassiz to his influential friend is written\r\nafter his final acceptance of the Neuchatel professorship.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .I would most gladly have answered your delightful letter at\r\nonce, and have told you how smoothly all has gone at Neuchatel.\r\nYour letters to M. de Coulon and to General von Pfuel have wrought\r\nmarvels; but they are now inclined to look upon me there as a\r\nwonder from the deep,* (* Ein blaues Meerwunder.) and I must exert\r\nmyself to the utmost lest my actual presence should give the lie to\r\nfame. It is all right. I shall be the less likely to relax in\r\ndevotion to my work.\r\n\r\nThe real reason of my silence has been that I was unwilling to\r\nacknowledge so many evidences of efficient sympathy and friendly\r\nencouragement by an empty letter. I wished especially to share with\r\nyou the final result of my investigations on the fossil fishes, and\r\nfor that purpose it was necessary to revise my manuscripts and take\r\nan account of my tables in order to condense the whole in a few\r\nphrases. I have already told you that the investigation of the\r\nliving fishes had suggested to me a new classification, in which\r\nfamilies as at present circumscribed respectively received new, and\r\nto my thinking more natural positions, based upon other\r\nconsiderations than those hitherto brought forward. I did not at\r\nfirst lay any special stress on my classification. . .My object was\r\nonly to utilize certain structural characters which frequently\r\nrecur among fossil forms, and which might therefore enable me to\r\ndetermine remains hitherto considered of little value. . .Absorbed\r\nin the special investigation, I paid no heed to the edifice which\r\nwas meanwhile unconsciously building itself up. Having however\r\ncompleted the comparison of the fossil species in Paris, I wanted,\r\nfor the sake of an easy revision of the same, to make a list\r\naccording to their succession in geological formations, with a view\r\nof determining the characteristics more exactly and bringing them\r\nby their enumeration into bolder relief. What was my joy and\r\nsurprise to find that the simplest enumeration of the fossil fishes\r\naccording to their geological succession was also a complete\r\nstatement of the natural relations of the families among\r\nthemselves; that one might therefore read the genetic development\r\nof the whole class in the history of creation, the representation\r\nof the genera and species in the several families being therein\r\ndetermined; in one word, that the genetic succession of the fishes\r\ncorresponds perfectly with their zoological classification, and\r\nwith just that classification proposed by me. The question\r\ntherefore in characterizing formations is no longer that of the\r\nnumerical preponderance of certain genera and species, but of\r\ndistinct structural relations, carried through all these formations\r\naccording to a definite direction, following each other in an\r\nappointed order, and recognizable in the organisms as they are\r\nbrought forth. . .If my conclusions are not overturned or modified\r\nthrough some later discovery, they will form a new basis for the\r\nstudy of fossils. Should you communicate my discovery to others I\r\nshall be especially pleased, because it may be long before I can\r\nbegin to publish it myself, and many may be interested in it. This\r\nseems to me the most important of my results, though I have also,\r\npartly from perfect specimens, partly from fragments, identified\r\nsome five hundred extinct species, and more than fifty extinct\r\ngenera, beside reestablishing three families no longer represented.\r\n\r\nCotta has written me in very polite terms that he could not\r\nundertake anything new at present; he would rather pay, without regard\r\nto profit, for what has been done thus far, and lets me have fifteen\r\nhundred francs. This makes it possible for me to leave Dinkel in Paris\r\nto complete the drawings. Although it often seems to me hard, I must\r\nreconcile myself to the thought of leaving investigations which are\r\nactually completed, locked up in my desk. . .\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n1832-1834: AGE 25-27.\r\n\r\nEnters upon his Professorship at Neuchatel.\r\nFirst Lecture.\r\nSuccess as a Teacher.\r\nLove of Teaching.\r\nInfluence upon the Scientific Life of Neuchatel.\r\nProposal from University of Heidelberg.\r\nProposal declined.\r\nThreatened Blindness.\r\nCorrespondence with Humboldt.\r\nMarriage.\r\nInvitation from Charpentier.\r\nInvitation to visit England.\r\nWollaston Prize.\r\nFirst Number of \"Poissons Fossiles.\"\r\nReview of the Work.\r\n\r\nTHE following autumn Agassiz assumed the duties of his\r\nprofessorship at Neuchatel. His opening lecture \"Upon the Relations\r\nbetween the different branches of Natural History and the then\r\nprevailing tendencies of all the Sciences\" was given on the 12th of\r\nNovember, 1832, at the Hotel de Ville. Judged by the impression\r\nmade upon the listeners as recorded at the time, this introductory\r\ndiscourse must have been characterized by the same broad spirit of\r\ngeneralization which marked Agassiz's later teaching. Facts in his\r\nhands fell into their orderly relation as parts of a connected\r\nwhole, and were never presented merely as special or isolated\r\nphenomena. From the beginning his success as an instructor was\r\nundoubted. He had, indeed, now entered upon the occupation which\r\nwas to be from youth to old age the delight of his life. Teaching\r\nwas a passion with him, and his power over his pupils might be\r\nmeasured by his own enthusiasm. He was intellectually, as well as\r\nsocially, a democrat, in the best sense. He delighted to scatter\r\nbroadcast the highest results of thought and research, and to adapt\r\nthem even to the youngest and most uninformed minds. In his later\r\nAmerican travels he would talk of glacial phenomena to the driver\r\nof a country stage-coach among the mountains, or to some workman,\r\nsplitting rock at the road-side, with as much earnestness as if he\r\nhad been discussing problems with a brother geologist; he would\r\ntake the common fisherman into his scientific confidence, telling\r\nhim the intimate secrets of fish structure or fish-embryology, till\r\nthe man in his turn grew enthusiastic, and began to pour out\r\ninformation from the stores of his own rough and untaught habits of\r\nobservation. Agassiz's general faith in the susceptibility of the\r\npopular intelligence, however untrained, to the highest truths of\r\nnature, was contagious, and he created or developed that in which\r\nhe believed.\r\n\r\nIn Neuchatel the presence of the young professor was felt at once\r\nas a new and stimulating influence. The little town suddenly became\r\na centre of scientific activity. A society for the pursuit of the\r\nnatural sciences, of which he was the first secretary, sprang into\r\nlife. The scientific collections, which had already attained, under\r\nthe care of M. Louis Coulon, considerable value, presently assumed\r\nthe character and proportions of a well-ordered museum. In M.\r\nCoulon Agassiz found a generous friend and a scientific colleague\r\nwho sympathized with his noblest aspirations, and was ever ready to\r\nsustain all his efforts in behalf of scientific progress. Together\r\nthey worked in arranging, enlarging, and building up a museum of\r\nnatural history which soon became known as one of the best local\r\ninstitutions of the kind in Europe.\r\n\r\nBeside his classes at the gymnasium, Agassiz collected about him,\r\nby invitation, a small audience of friends and neighbors, to whom\r\nhe lectured during the winter on botany, on zoology, on the\r\nphilosophy of nature. The instruction was of the most familiar and\r\ninformal character, and was continued in later years for his own\r\nchildren and the children of his friends. In the latter case the\r\nsubjects were chiefly geology and geography in connection with\r\nbotany, and in favorable weather the lessons were usually given in\r\nthe open air. One can easily imagine what joy it must have been for\r\na party of little playmates, boys and girls, to be taken out for\r\nlong walks in the country over the hills about Neuchatel, and\r\nespecially to Chaumont, the mountain which rises behind it, and\r\nthus to have their lessons, for which the facts and scenes about\r\nthem furnished subject and illustration, combined with pleasant\r\nrambles. From some high ground affording a wide panoramic view\r\nAgassiz would explain to them the formation of lakes, islands,\r\nrivers, springs, water-sheds, hills, and valleys. He always\r\ninsisted that physical geography could be better taught to children\r\nin the vicinity of their own homes than by books or maps, or even\r\nglobes. Nor did he think a varied landscape essential to such\r\ninstruction. Undulations of the ground, some contrast of hill and\r\nplain, some sheet of water with the streams that feed it, some\r\nridge of rocky soil acting as a water-shed, may be found\r\neverywhere, and the relation of facts shown perhaps as well on a\r\nsmall as on a large scale.\r\n\r\nWhen it was impossible to give the lessons out of doors, the\r\nchildren were gathered around a large table, where each one had\r\nbefore him or her the specimens of the day, sometimes stones and\r\nfossils, sometimes flowers, fruits, or dried plants. To each child\r\nin succession was explained separately what had first been told to\r\nall collectively. When the talk was of tropical or distant\r\ncountries pains were taken to procure characteristic specimens, and\r\nthe children were introduced to dates, bananas, cocoa-nuts, and\r\nother fruits, not easily to be obtained in those days in a small\r\ninland town. They, of course, concluded the lesson by eating the\r\nspecimens, a practical illustration which they greatly enjoyed. A\r\nvery large wooden globe, on the surface of which the various\r\nfeatures of the earth as they came up for discussion could be\r\nshown, served to make them more clear and vivid. The children took\r\ntheir own share in the instruction, and were themselves made to\r\npoint out and describe that which had just been explained to them.\r\nThey took home their collections, and as a preparation for the next\r\nlesson were often called upon to classify and describe some unusual\r\nspecimen by their own unaided efforts. There was no tedium in the\r\nclass. Agassiz's lively, clear, and attractive method of teaching\r\nawakened their own powers of observation in his little pupils, and\r\nto some at least opened permanent sources of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHis instructions to his older pupils were based on the same\r\nmethods, and were no less acceptable to them than to the children.\r\nIn winter his professional courses to the students were chiefly\r\nupon zoology and kindred topics; in the summer he taught them\r\nbotany and geology, availing himself of the fine days for\r\nexcursions and practical instruction in the field. Professor Louis\r\nFavre, speaking of these excursions, which led them sometimes into\r\nthe gorges of the Seyon, sometimes into the forests of Chaumont,\r\nsays: \"They were fete days for the young people, who found in their\r\nprofessor an active companion, full of spirits, vigor, and gayety,\r\nwhose enthusiasm kindled in them the sacred fire of science.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before his growing reputation brought him\r\ninvitations from elsewhere. One of the first of these was from\r\nHeidelberg.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR TIEDEMANN TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG, December 4, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .Last autumn, when I had the pleasure of meeting you in\r\nCarlsruhe, I proposed to you to give some lectures on Natural\r\nHistory at this university. Professor Leuckart, who till now\r\nrepresented zoology here, is called to Freiburg, and you would\r\ntherefore be the only teacher in that department. The university\r\nbeing so frequented, a numerous audience may be counted upon. The\r\nzoological collection, by no means an insignificant one, is open to\r\nyour use. Professor Leuckart received a salary of five hundred\r\nflorins. This is now unappropriated, and I do not doubt that the\r\ngovernment, conformably to the proposition of the medical faculty,\r\nwould give you the appointment on the same terms. By your knowledge\r\nyou are prepared for the work of an able academical teacher. My\r\nadvice is, therefore, that you should not bind yourself to any\r\nlyceum or gymnasium, as a permanent position; such a place would\r\nnot suit a cultivated scientific man, nor does it offer a field for\r\nan accomplished scholar. Consider carefully, therefore, a question\r\nwhich concerns the efficiency of your life, and give me the result\r\nof your deliberation as soon as possible. Should it be favorable to\r\nthe acceptance of my proposition, I hope you will find yourself\r\nhere at Easter as full professor, with a salary of five hundred\r\nflorins, and a fitting field of activity for your knowledge. The\r\nfees for lectures and literary work might bring you in an\r\nadditional fifteen hundred gulden yearly. If you accede to this\r\noffer send me your inaugural dissertation, and make me acquainted\r\nwith your literary work, that I may take the necessary steps with\r\nthe Curatorio. Consider this proposition as a proof of my high\r\nappreciation of your literary efforts and of my regard for you\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nAgassiz's next letter to Humboldt is to consult him with respect to\r\nthe call from Heidelberg, while it is also full of pleasure at the\r\nwarm welcome extended to him in Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1832.\r\n\r\n. . .At last I am in Neuchatel, having, indeed, begun my lectures\r\nsome weeks ago. I have been received in a way I could never have\r\nanticipated, and which can only be due to your good-will on my\r\nbehalf and your friendly recommendation. You have my warmest thanks\r\nfor the trouble you have taken about me, and for your continued\r\nsympathy. Let me show you by my work in the years to come, rather\r\nthan by words, that I am in earnest about science, and that my\r\nspirit is not irresponsive to a noble encouragement such as you\r\nhave given me.\r\n\r\nYou will have received my letter from Carlsruhe. Could I only tell\r\nyou all that I have since thought and observed about the history of\r\nour earth's development, the succession of the animal populations,\r\nand their genetic classification! It cannot easily be compressed\r\nwithin letter limits; I will, nevertheless, attempt it when my\r\nlectures make less urgent claim upon me, and my eyes are less\r\nfatigued. I should defer writing till then were it not that to-day\r\nI have something of at least outside interest to announce. It\r\nconcerns the inclosed letter received to-day. (The offer of a\r\nprofessorship at Heidelberg.) Should you think that I need not take\r\nit into consideration, and you have no time to answer me, let me\r\nknow your opinion by your silence. I will tell you the reasons\r\nwhich would induce me to remain for the present in Neuchatel, and I\r\nthink you will approve them. First, as my lectures do not claim a\r\ngreat part of my time I shall have the more to bestow on other\r\nwork; add to this the position of Neuchatel, so favorable for\r\nobservations such as I propose making on the history of development\r\nin several classes of animals; then the hope of freeing myself from\r\nthe burden of my collections; and next, the quiet of my life here\r\nwith reference to my somewhat overstrained health. Beside my wish\r\nto remain, these favorable circumstances furnish a powerful motive,\r\nand then I am satisfied that people here would assist me with the\r\ngreatest readiness should my publications not succeed otherwise. As\r\nto the publication of my fishes, I can, after all, better direct\r\nthe lithographing of the plates here. I have just written to Cotta\r\nconcerning this, proposing also that he should advance the cost of\r\nthe lithographs. I shall attend to it all carefully, and be content\r\nfor the present with my small means. From the gradual sale he can,\r\nlittle by little, repay my expenses, and I shall ask no profit\r\nuntil the success of the work warrants it. I await his answer. This\r\nproposal seems to me the best and the most likely to advance the\r\npublication of this work.\r\n\r\nSince I arrived here some scientific efforts have been made with\r\nthe help of M. Coulon. We have already founded a society of Natural\r\nHistory,* (* Societe des Sciences Naturelles de Neuchatel.) and I\r\nhope, should you make your promised visit next year, you will find\r\nthis germ between foliage and flower at least, though perhaps not\r\nyet ripened into seed. . .\r\n\r\nM. Coulon told me the day before yesterday that he had spoken with\r\nM. de Montmollin, the Treasurer, who would write to M. Ancillon\r\nconcerning the purchase of my collection. . .Will you have the\r\nkindness, when occasion offers, to say a word to M. Ancillon about\r\nit?. . .Not only would this collection be of the greatest value to\r\nthe museum here, but its sale would also advance my farther\r\ninvestigations. With the sum of eighty louis, which is all that is\r\nsubscribed for my professorship, I cannot continue them on any\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nI await now with anxiety Cotta's answer to my last proposition; but\r\nwhatever it be, I shall begin the lithographing of the plates\r\nimmediately after the New Year, as they must be carried on under my\r\nown eye and direction. This I can well do since my uncle, Dr. Mayor\r\nin Lausanne, gives me fifty louis toward it, the amount of one\r\nyear's pay to Weber, my former lithographer in Munich. I have\r\ntherefore written him to come, and expect him after New Year. With\r\nmy salary I can also henceforth keep Dinkel, who is now in Paris,\r\ndrawing the last fossils which I described. . .\r\n\r\nNo answer to this letter has been found beyond such as is implied\r\nin the following to M. Coulon.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO M. COULON, FILS.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, January 21, 1833.\r\n\r\n. . .It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the flattering\r\nwelcome offered by you and your fellow-citizens to M. Agassiz, who\r\nstands so high in science, and whose intellectual qualities are\r\nenhanced by his amiable character. They write me from Heidelberg\r\nthat they intend the place of M. Leuckart in zoology for my young\r\nfriend. The choice is proposed by M. Tiedemann, and certainly\r\nnothing could be more honorable to M. Agassiz. Nevertheless, I hope\r\nthat he will refuse it. He should remain for some years in your\r\ncountry, where a generous encouragement facilitates the publication\r\nof his work, which is of equal importance to zoology and geology.\r\n\r\nI have spoken with M. Ancillon, and have left with him an official\r\nnotice respecting the purchase of the Agassiz collection. The\r\ndifficulty will be found, as in all human affairs, in the prose of\r\nlife, in money. M. Ancillon writes me this morning: \"Your paper in\r\nfavor of M. Agassiz is a scientific letter of credit which we shall\r\ntry to honor. The acquisition of a superior man and a superior\r\ncollection at the same time would be a double conquest for the\r\nprincipality of Neuchatel. I have requested a report from the\r\nCouncil of State on the means of accomplishing this, and I hope\r\nthat private individuals may do something toward it.\" Thus you see\r\nthe affair is at least on the right road. I do not think, however,\r\nthat the royal treasury will give at present more than a thousand\r\nPrussian crowns toward it. . .\r\n\r\nRegarding the invitation to Heidelberg, Agassiz's decision was\r\nalready made. A letter to his brother toward the close of December\r\nmentions that he is offered a professorship at the University of\r\nHeidelberg, but that, although his answer has not actually gone, he\r\nhas resolved to decline it; adding that the larger salary is\r\ncounterbalanced in his mind by the hope of selling his collection\r\nat Neuchatel, and thus freeing himself from a heavy burden.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was now threatened with a great misfortune. Already, in\r\nParis, his eyes had begun to suffer from the strain of microscopic\r\nwork. They now became seriously impaired; and for some months he\r\nwas obliged to abate his activity, and to refrain even from writing\r\na letter. During this time, while he was shut up in a darkened\r\nroom, he practiced the study of fossils by touch alone, using even\r\nthe tip of the tongue to feel out the impression, when the fingers\r\nwere not sufficiently sensitive. He said he was sure at the time\r\nthat he could bring himself in this way to such delicacy of touch\r\nthat the loss of sight would not oblige him to abandon his work.\r\nAfter some months his eyes improved, and though at times threatened\r\nwith a return of the same malady, he was able, throughout life, to\r\nuse his eyes more uninterruptedly than most persons. His lectures,\r\nalways delivered extemporaneously, do not seem to have been\r\nsuspended for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Agassiz to Humboldt is taken from a rough\r\nand incomplete draught, which was evidently put aside (perhaps on\r\naccount of the trouble in his eyes), and only completed in the\r\nfollowing May. Although imperfect, it explains Humboldt's answer,\r\nwhich is not only interesting in itself, but throws light on\r\nAgassiz's work at this period.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, January 27, 1833.\r\n\r\n. . .A thousand thanks for your last most welcome letter. I can\r\nhardly tell you what pleasure it gave me, or how I am cheered and\r\nstimulated to new activity by intercourse with you on so intimate a\r\nfooting. Since I wrote you, some things have become more clear to\r\nme, as, for instance, my purpose of publishing the \"Fossil Fishes\"\r\nhere. Certain doubts remain in my mind, however, about which, as\r\nwell as about other matters, I would ask your advice. Now that\r\nCotta is dead, I cannot wait till I have made an arrangement with\r\nhis successor. I therefore allow the \"Fresh-Water Fishes\" to lie by\r\nand drive on the others. Upon careful examination I have found, to\r\nmy astonishment, that all necessary means for the publication of\r\nsuch a work are to be had here: two good lithographers and two\r\nprinting establishments, both of which have excellent type. I have\r\nsent for Weber to engrave the plates, or draw them on stone; he\r\nwill be here at the end of the month. Then I shall begin at once,\r\nand hope in May to send out the first number. The great difficulty\r\nremains now in the distribution of the numbers, and in finding a\r\nsufficient sale so that they may follow each other with regularity.\r\nI think it better to begin the publication as a whole than to send\r\nout an abridgment in advance. The species can be characterized only\r\nby good illustrations. A summary always requires farther\r\ndemonstration, whereas, if I give the plates at once I can shorten\r\nthe text and present the general results as an introduction to the\r\nfirst number. With twelve numbers, of twenty plates each, followed\r\nby about ten pages of text, I can tell all that I have to say. The\r\ncost of one hundred and fifty copies printed here would, according\r\nto careful inquiry, be covered by seventy subscriptions if the\r\nprice were put at one louis-d'or the number.\r\n\r\nNow comes the question whether I should print more than one hundred\r\nand fifty copies. On account of the expense I shall not preserve\r\nthe stones. For the distribution of the copies and the collecting\r\nof the money could you, perhaps, recommend me to some house in\r\nBerlin or Leipzig, who would take the work for sale in Germany on\r\ncommission under reasonable conditions? For England, I wrote\r\nyesterday to Lyell, and to-morrow I shall write to Levrault and\r\nBossange.\r\n\r\nBoth the magistrates and private individuals here are now much\r\ninterested in public instruction, and I am satisfied that sooner or\r\nlater my collection will be purchased, though nothing has been said\r\nabout it lately.* (* His collection was finally purchased by the\r\ncity of Neuchatel in the spring of 1833.)\r\n\r\nFor a closer description of my family of Lepidostei, to which\r\nbelong all the ante-chalk bony fishes, I am anxious to have for\r\ndissection a Polypterus Bichir and a Lepidosteus osseus, or any\r\nother species belonging exclusively to the present creation.\r\nHitherto, I have only been able to examine and describe the\r\nskeleton and external parts. If you could obtain a specimen of both\r\nfor me you would do me the greatest service. If necessary, I will\r\nengage to return the preparations. I beg for this most earnestly.\r\nForgive the many requests contained in this letter, and see in it\r\nonly my ardent desire to reach my aim, in which you have already\r\nhelped me so often and so kindly.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nSANS SOUCI, July 4, 1833.\r\n\r\n. . .I am happy in your success, my dear Agassiz, happy in your\r\ncharming letter of May 22nd, happy in the hope of having been able\r\nto do something that may be useful to you for the subscription. The\r\nPrince Royal's name seemed to me rather important for you. I have\r\ndelayed writing, not because I am one of the most persecuted men in\r\nEurope (the persecution goes on crescendo; there is not a scholar\r\nin Prussia or Germany having anything to ask of the King, or of M.\r\nd'Altenstein, who does not think it necessary to make me his agent,\r\nwith power of attorney), but because it was necessary to await the\r\nPrince Royal's return from his military circuit, and the\r\nopportunity of speaking to him alone, which does not occur when I\r\nam with the King.\r\n\r\nYour prospectus is full of interest, and does ample justice to\r\nthose who have provided you with materials. To name me among them\r\nwas an affectionate deceit, the ruse of a noble soul like yours; I\r\nam a little vexed with you about it.* (* The few words which called\r\nforth this protest from Humboldt were as follows. After naming all\r\nthose from whom he had received help in specimens or otherwise,\r\nAgassiz concludes:--\"Finally, I owe to M. de Humboldt not only\r\nimportant notes on fossil fishes, but so many kindnesses in\r\nconnection with my work that in enumerating them I should fear to\r\nwound the delicacy of the giver.\" This will hardly seem an\r\nexaggeration to those who know the facts of the case.)\r\n\r\nHere is the beginning of a list. I think the Department of the\r\nMines de Province will take three or four more copies. We have not\r\ntheir answer yet. Do not be frightened at the brevity of the list\r\n. . .I am, however, the least apt of all men in collecting\r\nsubscriptions, seeing no one but the court, and forced to be out of\r\ntown three or four days in the week. On account of this same\r\ninaptitude, I beg you to send me, through the publisher, only my\r\nown three copies, and to address the others, through the publisher\r\nalso, to the individuals named on the list, merely writing on each\r\ncopy that the person has subscribed on the list of M. de Humboldt.\r\n\r\nWith all my affection for you, my dear friend, it would be\r\nimpossible for me to take charge of the distribution of your\r\nnumbers or the returns. The publishing houses of Dummler or of\r\nHumblot and Dunker would be useful to you at Berlin. I find it\r\ndifficult to believe that you will navigate successfully among\r\nthese literary corsairs! I have had a short eulogium of your work\r\ninserted in the Berliner Staats-Zeitung. You see that I do not\r\nneglect your interests, and that, for love of you, I even turn\r\njournalist. You have omitted to state in your prospectus whether\r\nyour plates are lithographed, as I fear they are, and also whether\r\nthey are colored, which seems to me unnecessary. Have your superb\r\noriginal drawings remained in your possession, or are they included\r\nin the sale of your collection?. . .\r\n\r\nI could not make use of your letter to the King, and I have\r\nsuppressed it. You have been ill-advised as to the forms.\r\n\"Erhabener Konig\" has too poetical a turn; we have here the most\r\nprosaic and the most degrading official expressions. M. de Pfuel\r\nmust have some Arch-Prussian with him, who would arrange the\r\nformula of a letter for you. At the head there must be \"Most\r\nenlightened, most powerful King,--all gracious sovereign and lord.\"\r\nThen you begin, \"Your Royal Majesty, deeply moved, I venture to lay\r\nat your feet most humbly my warmest thanks for the support so\r\ngraciously granted to the purchase of my collection for the\r\nGymnasium in Neuchatel. Did I know how to write,\" etc. The rest of\r\nyour letter was very good; put only \"so much grace as to answer\"\r\ninstead of \"so much kindness.\" You should end with the words, \"I\r\nremain till death, in deepest reverence, the most humble and\r\nfaithful servant of your Royal Majesty.\" The whole on small folio,\r\nsealed, addressed outside, \"To the King's Majesty, Berlin.\" Send\r\nthe letter, not through me, but officially, through M. de Pfuel.*\r\n(* At the head there must be \"Allerdurchlauchtigster,\r\ngrossmachtigster Konig,--allergnadigster Konig und Herr.\" Then you\r\nbegin, \"Euer koniglichen Majestat, wage ich meinen lebhaftesten\r\nDank fur die allergnadigst bewilligte Unterstutzung zum Ankauf\r\nmeiner Sammlung fur das Gymnasium in Neuchatel tief geruhrt\r\nallerunterthanigst zu Fussen zu legen. Wusste ich zu schreiben,\"\r\netc. The rest of your letter was very good,--put only, \"so vieler\r\nGnade zu entsprechen\" instead of \"so vieler Gute.\" You should end\r\nwith the words, \"Ich ersterbe in tiefster Ehrfurcht Euer\r\nkoniglicher Majestat aller onter thanigsten getreuester.\" The whole\r\nin small folio, sealed, addressed outside, \"An des Konig's\r\nMajestat, Berlin.\" These forms are no longer in use. They belong to\r\na past generation.)\r\n\r\nThe letter to the King is not absolutely necessary, but it will\r\ngive pleasure, for the King likes any affectionate demonstration\r\nfrom the country that has now become yours.* (* It may not be known\r\nto all readers that Neuchatel was then under Prussian sovereignty.)\r\nIt will be useful, also, with reference to our request for the\r\npurchase of some copies, which we will make to the King as soon as\r\nthe first number has appeared. Had I obtained the King's name for\r\nyou to-day (which would have been difficult, since the King detests\r\nsubscriptions), we should have spoiled the sequence. It seems to me\r\nthat a letter of acknowledgment from you to M. Ancillon would be\r\nvery suitable also. Do not think it is too late. One addresses him\r\nas \"Monsieur et plus votre Excellence.\" I am writing the most\r\npedantic letter in the world in answer to yours, so full of charm.\r\nIt must seem to you absurd that I write you in French, when you,\r\nFrench by origin, or rather by language, prefer to write me in\r\nGerman. Pray tell me, did you learn German, which you write with\r\nsuch purity, as a child?\r\n\r\nI am happy to see that you publish the whole together. The\r\nparceling out of such a work would have led to endless delays; but,\r\nfor mercy's sake, take care of your eyes; they are OURS. I have not\r\nneglected the subscriptions in Russia, but I have, as yet, no\r\nanswer. At a venture, I have placed the name of M. von Buch on my\r\nlist. He is absent; it is said that he will go to Greece this\r\nsummer. Pray make it a rule not to give away copies of your work.\r\nIf you follow that inclination you will be pecuniarily ruined.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have been present at your course of lectures. What\r\nyou tell me of them delights me, though I am ready to do battle\r\nwith you about those metamorphoses of our globe which have even\r\nslipped into your title. I see by your letter that you cling to the\r\nidea of internal vital processes of the earth, that you regard the\r\nsuccessive formations as different phases of life, the rocks as\r\nproducts of metamorphosis. I think this symbolical language should\r\nbe employed with great reserve, I know that point of view of the\r\nold \"Naturphilosophie;\" I have examined it without prejudice, but\r\nnothing seems to me more dissimilar than the vital action of the\r\nmetamorphosis of a plant in order to form the calyx or the flower,\r\nand the successive formation of beds of conglomerate. There is\r\norder, it is true, in the superposed beds, sometimes an alternation\r\nof the same substance, an interior cause,--sometimes even a\r\nsuccessive development, starting from a central heat; but can the\r\nterm \"life\" be applied to this kind of movement? Limestone does not\r\ngenerate sandstone. I do not know that there exists what\r\nphysiologists call a vital force, different from, or opposed to,\r\nthe physical forces which we recognize in all matter; I think the\r\nvital process is only a particular mode of action, of limitation of\r\nthose physical forces; action, the nature of which we have not yet\r\nfully sounded. I believe there are nervous storms (electric) like\r\nthose which set fire to the atmosphere, but that special action\r\nwhich we call organic, in which every part becomes cause or effect,\r\nseems to me distinct from the changes which our planet has\r\nundergone. I pause here, for I feel that I must annoy you, and I\r\ncare for you too much to run that risk. Moreover, a superior man\r\nlike yourself, my dear friend, floats above material things and\r\nleaves a margin for philosophic doubt.\r\n\r\nFarewell; count on the little of life that remains to me, and on my\r\naffectionate devotion. At twenty-six years of age, and possessed of\r\nso much knowledge, you are only entering upon life, while I am\r\npreparing to depart; leaving this world far different from what I\r\nhoped it would be in my youth. I will not forget the Bichir and the\r\nLepidosteus. Remember always that your letters give me the greatest\r\npleasure. . .\r\n\r\n[P.S.] Look carefully at the new number of Poggendorf, in which you\r\nwill find beautiful discoveries of Ehrenberg (microscopical) on the\r\ndifference of structure between the brain and the nerves of motion,\r\nalso upon the crystals forming the silvered portion of the\r\nperitoneum of Esox lucius.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1833, Agassiz's marriage to Cecile Braun, the sister of\r\nhis life-long friend, Alexander Braun, took place. He brought his\r\nwife home to a small apartment in Neuchatel, where they began their\r\nhousekeeping after the simplest fashion, with such economy as their\r\nvery limited means enforced. Her rare artistic talent, hitherto\r\ndevoted to her brother's botanical pursuits, now found a new field.\r\nTrained to accuracy in drawing objects of Natural History, she had\r\nan artist's eye for form and color. Some of the best drawings in\r\nthe Fossil Fishes and the Fresh-Water Fishes are from her hand.\r\nThroughout the summer, notwithstanding the trouble in his eyes,\r\nAgassiz had been still pressing on these works. His two artists,\r\nMr. Dinkel and Mr. Weber, the former in Paris, the latter in\r\nNeuchatel, were constantly busy on his plates.\r\n\r\nAlthough Agassiz was at this time only twenty-six years of age, his\r\ncorrespondence already shows that the interest of scientific men,\r\nall over Europe, was attracted to him and to his work. From\r\ninvestigators of note in his own country, from those of France,\r\nItaly, and Germany, from England, and even from America, the\r\ndistant El Dorado of naturalists in those days, came offers of\r\ncooperation, accompanied by fossil fishes or by the drawings of\r\nrare or unique specimens. He was known in all the museums of Europe\r\nas an indefatigable worker and collector, seeking everywhere\r\nmaterials for comparison.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters of this date is one from Charpentier, one of the\r\npioneers of glacial investigation, under whose auspices, two years\r\nlater, Agassiz began his inquiries into glacial phenomena. He\r\nwrites him from the neighborhood of Bex, his home in the valley of\r\nthe Rhone, the classic land of glacial work; but he writes of\r\nAgassiz's special subjects, inviting him to come and see such\r\nfossils as were to be found in his neighborhood, and to investigate\r\ncertain phenomena of upheaval and of plutonic action in the same\r\nregion, little dreaming that the young zoologist was presently to\r\njoin him in his own chosen field of research.\r\n\r\nAgassiz now began also to receive pressing invitations from the\r\nEnglish naturalists, from Buckland, Lyell, Murchison, and others,\r\nto visit England, and examine their wonderful collections of fossil\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR BUCKLAND TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nOXFORD, December 25, 1833.\r\n\r\n. . .I should very much like to put into your hands what few\r\nmaterials I possess in the Oxford Museum relating to fossil fishes,\r\nand am also desirous that you should see the fossil fish in the\r\nvarious provincial museums of England, as well as in London. Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton has a very large collection of fishes from Engi and\r\nOeningen, which he wishes to place at your disposition. Like\r\nmyself, he would willingly send you drawings, but drawings made\r\nwithout knowledge of the anatomical details which you require,\r\ncannot well represent what the artist himself does not perceive. I\r\nwould willingly lend you my specimens, if I could secure them\r\nagainst the barbarous hands of the custom-house officials. What I\r\nwould propose to you as a means of seeing all the collections of\r\nEngland, and gaining at the same time additional subscriptions for\r\nyour work, is, that you should come to England and attend the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science in September\r\nnext. There you will meet all the naturalists of England, and I do\r\nnot doubt that among them you will find a good many subscribers.\r\nYou will likewise see a new mine of fossil fishes in the clayey\r\nschist of the coal formation at Newhaven, on the banks of the\r\nForth, near Edinburgh. You can also make arrangements to visit the\r\nmuseums of York, Whitby, Scarborough, and Leeds, as well as the\r\nmuseum of Sir Philip Egerton, on your way to and from Edinburgh.\r\nYou may, likewise, visit the museums of London, Cambridge, and\r\nOxford; everywhere there are fossil fishes; and traveling by coach\r\nin England is so rapid, easy, and cheap, that in six weeks or less\r\nyou can accomplish all that I have proposed. As I seriously hope\r\nthat you will come to England for the months of August and\r\nSeptember, I say nothing at present of any other means of putting\r\ninto your hands the drawings or specimens of our English fossil\r\nfishes. I forgot to mention the very rich collection of fossil\r\nfishes in the Museum of Mr. Mantell, at Brighton, where, I think,\r\nyou could take the weekly steam-packet for Rotterdam as easily as\r\nin London, and thus arrive in Neuchatel from London in a very few\r\ndays. . .\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO PROFESSOR BUCKLAND.\r\n\r\n. . .I thank you most warmly for the very important information you\r\nhave so kindly given me respecting the rich collections of England;\r\nI will, if possible, make arrangements to visit them this year, and\r\nin that case I will beg you to let me have a few letters of\r\nrecommendation to facilitate my examination of them in detail. Not\r\nthat I question for a moment the liberality of the English\r\nnaturalists. All the continental savants who have visited your\r\nmuseums have praised the kindness shown in intrusting to them the\r\nrarest objects, and I well know that the English rival other\r\nnations in this respect, and even leave them far behind. But one\r\nmust have merited such favors by scientific labors; to a beginner\r\nthey are always a free gift, wholly undeserved. . .\r\n\r\nA few months later Agassiz received a very gratifying and\r\nsubstantial mark of the interest felt by English naturalists in his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LYELL TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nSOMERSET HOUSE, LONDON, February 4, 1834.\r\n\r\n. . .It is with the greatest pleasure that I announce to you good\r\nnews. The Geological Society of London desires me to inform you\r\nthat it has this year conferred upon you the prize bequeathed by\r\nDr. Wollaston. He has given us the sum of one thousand pounds\r\nsterling, begging us to expend the interest, or about seven hundred\r\nand fifty francs every year, for the encouragement of the science\r\nof geology. Your work on fishes has been considered by the Council\r\nand the officers of the Geological Society worthy of this prize,\r\nDr. Wollaston having said that it could be given for unfinished\r\nworks. The sum of thirty guineas, or 31 pounds 10 shillings\r\nsterling, has been placed in my hands, but I would not send you the\r\nmoney before knowing exactly where you were and learning from you\r\nwhere you wish it to be paid. You will probably like an order on\r\nsome Swiss banker.\r\n\r\nI cannot yet give you the extract from the address of the President\r\nin which your work is mentioned, but I shall have it soon. In the\r\nmean time I am desired to tell you that the Society declines to\r\nreceive your magnificent work as a gift, but wishes to subscribe\r\nfor it, and has already ordered a copy from the publishers. . .\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO LYELL.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, March 25, 1834.\r\n\r\n. . .You cannot imagine the joy your letter has given me. The prize\r\nawarded to me is at once so unexpected an honor and so welcome an\r\naid that I could hardly believe my eyes when, with tears of relief\r\nand gratitude, I read your letter. In the presence of a savant, I\r\nneed not be ashamed of my penury, since I have spent the little I\r\nhad, wholly in scientific researches. I do not, therefore, hesitate\r\nto confess to you that at no time could your gift have given me\r\ngreater pleasure. Generous friends have helped me to bring out the\r\nfirst number of my \"Fossil Fishes;\" the plates of the second are\r\nfinished, but I was greatly embarrassed to know how to print a\r\nsufficient number of copies before the returns from the first\r\nshould be paid in. The text is ready also, so that now, in a\r\nfortnight, I can begin the distribution, and, the rotation once\r\nestablished, I hope that preceding numbers will always enable me to\r\npublish the next in succession without interruption. I even count\r\nupon this resource as affording me the means of making a journey to\r\nEngland before long. If no obstacle arises I hope to accomplish\r\nthis during the coming summer, and to be present at the next\r\nmeeting of the English naturalists.\r\n\r\nI do not live the less happily on account of my anxieties, but I am\r\nsometimes obliged to work more than I well can, or ought in reason\r\nto do. . .The second number of my \"Fossil Fishes\" contains the\r\nbeginning of the anatomy of the fishes, but only such portions as\r\nare to be found in the fossil state. I have begun with the scales;\r\nlater, I treat of the bones and the teeth. Then comes the\r\ncontinuation of the description of the Ganoids and the Scomberoids,\r\nand an additional sheet contains a sketch of my ichthyological\r\nclassification. The plates are even more successful than those of\r\nthe first number. If all goes well the third number will appear\r\nnext July. I long to visit your rich collections; I hope that\r\nwhenever it becomes possible for me to do so, I shall have the good\r\nfortune to find you in London. . .\r\n\r\nI have thought a letter addressed to the President of the Society\r\nin particular, and to the members in general, would be fitting.\r\nWill you have the kindness to deliver it for me to Mr. Murchison?\r\n\r\nThe first number of the \"Fossil Fishes\" had already appeared, and\r\nhad been greeted with enthusiasm by scientific men. Elie de\r\nBeaumont writes Agassiz in June, 1834: \"I have read with great\r\npleasure your first number; it promises us a work as important for\r\nscience as it is remarkable in execution. Do not let yourself be\r\ndiscouraged by obstacles of any kind; they will give way before the\r\nconcert of approbation which so excellent a work will awaken. I\r\nshall always be glad to aid in overcoming any one of them.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is as well to give here a slight sketch of this work,\r\nthe execution of which was carried on during the next ten years\r\n(1833-1843). The inscription tells, in few words, the author's\r\nreverence for Humboldt and his personal gratitude to him. \"These\r\npages owe to you their existence; accept their dedication.\" The\r\ntitle gives in a broad outline the comprehensive purpose of the\r\nwork:\r\n\r\n\"Researches on the Fossil Fishes: comprising an Introduction to the\r\nStudy of these Animals; the Comparative Anatomy of Organic Systems\r\nwhich may contribute to facilitate the Determination of Fossil\r\nSpecies; a New Classification of Fishes expressing their Relations\r\nto the Series of Formations; the Explanation of the Laws of their\r\nSuccession and Development during all the Changes of the\r\nTerrestrial Globe, accompanied by General Geological\r\nConsiderations; finally, the Description of about a thousand\r\nSpecies which no longer exist, and whose Characters have been\r\nrestored from Remains contained in the Strata of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe most novel results comprised in this work were: first, the\r\nremodeling of the classification of the whole type of fishes,\r\nfossil and living, and especially the separation of the Ganoids\r\nfrom all other fishes, under the rank of a distinct order; second,\r\nthe recognition of those combinations of reptilian and bird-like\r\ncharacters in the earlier geological fishes, which led the author\r\nto call them prophetic types; and third, his discovery of an\r\nanalogy between the embryological phases of the higher present\r\nfishes and the gradual introduction of the whole type on earth, the\r\nseries in growth and the series in time revealing a certain mutual\r\ncorrespondence. As these comprehensive laws have thrown light upon\r\nother types of the animal kingdom beside that of fishes, their\r\ndiscovery may be said to have advanced general zoology as well as\r\nichthyology.\r\n\r\nThe Introduction presents, as it were, the prelude to this vast\r\nchapter of natural history in the simultaneous appearance of the\r\nfour great types of the animal kingdom: Radiates, Mollusks,\r\nArticulates, and Vertebrates. Then comes the orderly development of\r\nthe class by which the vertebrate plan was first expressed, namely,\r\nthe fishes. Underlying all its divisions and subdivisions, is the\r\naverage expression of the type in the past and present; the\r\nPlacoids and Ganoids, with their combination of reptilian and\r\nfishlike features, characterizing the earlier geological epochs,\r\nwhile in the later the simple bony fishes, the Cycloids and\r\nCtenoids, take the ascendancy. Here, for the first time, Agassiz\r\npresents his \"synthetic or prophetic types,\" namely, early types\r\nembracing, as it were, in one large outline, features afterward\r\nindividualized in special groups, and never again reunited. No less\r\nstriking than these general views of structural relations are the\r\nclearness and simplicity with which the distribution of the whole\r\nclass of fishes in relation to the geological formations, or, in\r\nother words, to the physical history of the earth, is shown. In\r\nreading this introductory chapter, one familiar with Agassiz as a\r\npublic teacher will almost hear his voice marshaling the long\r\nprocession of living beings, as he was wont to do, in their gradual\r\nintroduction upon the earth. Indeed, his whole future work in\r\nichthyology, and one might almost say in general zoology, was here\r\nsketched.\r\n\r\nThe technicalities of this work, at once so comprehensive in its\r\ncombinations and so minute in its details, could interest only the\r\nprofessional reader, but its generalizations may well have a\r\ncertain attraction for every thoughtful mind. It treats of the\r\nrelations, anatomical, zoological, and geological, between the\r\nwhole class of fishes, fossil and living, illustrated by numerous\r\nplates, while additional light is thrown on the whole by the\r\nrevelations of embryology.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding these striking differences,\" says the author in\r\nthe opening of the fifth chapter on the relations of fishes in\r\ngeneral, \"it is none the less evident to the attentive observer\r\nthat one single idea has presided over the development of the whole\r\nclass, and that all the deviations lead back to a primary plan, so\r\nthat even if the thread seem broken in the present creation, one\r\ncan reunite it on reaching the domain of fossil ichthyology.\"* (*\r\nVolume 1 chapter 5 pages 92, 93.)\r\n\r\nHaving shown how the present creation has given him the key to past\r\ncreations, how the complete skeleton of the living fishes has\r\nexplained the scattered fragments of the ancient ones, especially\r\nthose of which the soft cartilaginous structure was liable to\r\ndecay, he presents two modes of studying the type as a whole;\r\neither in its comparative anatomy, including in the comparison the\r\nwhole history of the type, fossil and living, or in its comparative\r\nembryology. \"The results,\" he adds, \"of these two methods of study\r\ncomplete and control each other.\" In all his subsequent researches\r\nindeed, the history of the individual in its successive phases went\r\nhand in hand with the history of the type. He constantly tested his\r\nzoological results by his embryological investigations.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful description of the dorsal chord in its\r\nembryological development, he shows that a certain parallelism\r\nexists between the comparative degrees of development of the\r\nvertebral column in the different groups of fishes, and the phases\r\nof its embryonic development in the higher fishes. Farther on he\r\nshows a like coincidence between the development of the system of\r\nfins in the different groups of fishes, and the gradual growth and\r\ndifferentiation of the fins in the embryo of the higher living\r\nfishes.* (* \"Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles\", volume 1\r\nchapter 5 page 102.) \"There is, then,\" he concludes, \"as we have\r\nsaid above, a certain analogy, or rather a certain parallelism, to\r\nbe established between the embryological development of the\r\nCycloids and Ctenoids, and the genetic or paleontological\r\ndevelopment of the whole class. Considered from this point of view,\r\nno one will dispute that the form of the caudal fin is of high\r\nimportance for zoological and paleontological considerations, since\r\nit shows that the same thought, the same plan, which presides\r\nto-day over the formation of the embryo, is also manifested in the\r\nsuccessive development of the numerous creation which have formerly\r\npeopled the earth.\" Agassiz says himself in his Preface: \"I have\r\nsucceeded in expressing the laws of succession and of the organic\r\ndevelopment of fishes during all geological epochs; and science may\r\nhenceforth, in seeing the changes of this class from formation to\r\nformation, follow the progress of organization in one great\r\ndivision of the animal kingdom, through a complete series of the\r\nages of the earth.\" This is not inconsistent with his position as\r\nthe leading opponent of the development or Darwinian theories. To\r\nhim, development meant development of plan as expressed in\r\nstructure, not the change of one structure into another. To his\r\napprehension the change was based upon intellectual, not upon\r\nmaterial causes. He sums up his own conviction with reference to\r\nthis question as follows:* (* \"Recherches sur les Poissons\r\nFossiles\" volume 1 chapter 6 pages 171, 172. \"Essay on the\r\nClassification of Fishes.\") \"Such facts proclaim aloud principles\r\nnot yet discussed in science, but which paleontological researches\r\nplace before the eyes of the observer with an ever-increasing\r\npersistency. I speak of the relations of the creation with the\r\ncreator. Phenomena closely allied in the order of their succession,\r\nand yet without sufficient cause in themselves for their\r\nappearance; an infinite diversity of species without any common\r\nmaterial bond, so grouping themselves as to present the most\r\nadmirable progressive development to which our own species is\r\nlinked,--are these not incontestable proofs of the existence of a\r\nsuperior intelligence whose power alone could have established such\r\nan order of things?. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"More than fifteen hundred species of fossil fishes, which I have\r\nlearned to know, tell me that species do not pass insensibly one\r\ninto another, but that they appear and disappear unexpectedly,\r\nwithout direct relations with their precursors; for I think no one\r\nwill seriously pretend that the numerous types of Cycloids and\r\nCtenoids, almost all of which are contemporaneous with one an\r\nother, have descended from the Placoids and Ganoids. As well might\r\none affirm that the Mammalia, and man with them, have descended\r\ndirectly from fishes. All these species have a fixed epoch of\r\nappearance and disappearance; their existence is even limited to an\r\nappointed time. And yet they present, as a whole, numerous\r\naffinities more or less close, a definite coordination in a given\r\nsystem of organization which has intimate relations with the mode\r\nof existence of each type, and even of each species. An invisible\r\nthread unwinds itself throughout all time, across this immense\r\ndiversity, and presents to us as a definite result, a continual\r\nprogress in the development of which man is the term, of which the\r\nfour classes of vertebrates are intermediate forms, and the\r\ntotality of invertebrate animals the constant accessory\r\naccompaniment.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of carrying out comparisons so rigorous and\r\nextensive as were needed in order to reconstruct the organic\r\nrelations between the fossil fishes of all geological formations\r\nand those of the present world, is best told by the author.* (*\r\n\"Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles\" volume 1. Addition a la\r\nPreface.) \"Possessing no fossil fishes myself, and renouncing\r\nforever the acquisition of collections so precious, I have been\r\nforced to seek the materials for my work in all the collections of\r\nEurope containing such remains; I have, therefore, made frequent\r\njourneys in Germany, in France, and in England, in order to\r\nexamine, describe, and illustrate the objects of my researches. But\r\nnotwithstanding the cordiality with which even the most precious\r\nspecimens have been placed at my disposition, a serious\r\ninconvenience has resulted from this mode of working, namely, that\r\nI have rarely been able to compare directly the various specimens\r\nof the same species from different collections, and that I have\r\noften been obliged to make my identification from memory, or from\r\nsimple notes, or, in the more fortunate cases, from my drawings\r\nonly. It is impossible to imagine the fatigue, the exhaustion of\r\nall the faculties, involved in such a method. The hurry of\r\ntraveling, joined to the lack of the most ordinary facilities for\r\nobservation, has not rendered my task more easy. I therefore claim\r\nindulgence for such of my identifications as a later examination,\r\nmade at leisure, may modify, and for descriptions which sometimes\r\nbear the stamp of the precipitation with which they have been\r\nprepared.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, this experience of Agassiz's earlier life which\r\nmade him so anxious to establish a museum of comparative zoology in\r\nthis country,--a museum so abundant and comprehensive in material,\r\nthat the student should not only find all classes of the animal\r\nkingdom represented within its walls, but preserved also in such\r\nnumbers as to allow the sacrifice of many specimens for purposes of\r\ncomparison and study. He was resolved that no student should stand\r\nthere baffled at the door of knowledge, as he had often done\r\nhimself, when shown the one precious specimen, which could not be\r\nremoved, or even examined on the spot, because unique.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n1834-1837: AGE 27-30.\r\n\r\nFirst Visit to England.\r\nReception by Scientific Men.\r\nWork on Fossil Fishes there.\r\nLiberality of English Naturalists.\r\nFirst Relations with American Science.\r\nFarther Correspondence with Humboldt.\r\nSecond Visit to England.\r\nContinuation of \"Fossil Fishes.\"\r\nOther Scientific Publications.\r\nAttention drawn to Glacial Phenomena.\r\nSummer at Bex with Charpentier.\r\nSale of Original Drawings for \"Fossil Fishes.\"\r\nMeeting of Helvetic Society.\r\nAddress on Ice-Period.\r\nLetters from Humboldt and Von Buch.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1834, according to his cherished hope, Agassiz went to\r\nEngland, and was received by the scientific men with a cordial\r\nsympathy which left not a day or an hour of his short sojourn there\r\nunoccupied. The following letter from Buckland is one of many\r\nproffering hospitality and friendly advice on his arrival.\r\n\r\nDR. BUCKLAND TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nOXFORD, August 26, 1834.\r\n\r\n. . .I am rejoiced to hear of your safe arrival in London, and\r\nwrite to say that I am in Oxford, and that I shall be most happy to\r\nreceive you and give you a bed in my house if you can come here\r\nimmediately. I expect M. Arago and Mr. Pentland from Paris tomorrow\r\n(Wednesday) afternoon. I shall be most happy to show you our Oxford\r\nMuseum on Thursday or Friday, and to proceed with you toward\r\nEdinburgh. Sir Philip Egerton has a fine collection of fossil\r\nfishes near Chester, which you should visit on your road. I have\r\npartly engaged myself to be with him on Monday, September 1st, but\r\nI think it would be desirable for you to go to him Saturday, that\r\nyou may have time to take drawings of his fossil fishes.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell certainly what day I shall leave Oxford until I see\r\nM. Arago, whom I hope you will meet at my house, on your arrival in\r\nOxford. I shall hope to see you Wednesday evening or Thursday\r\nmorning. Pray come to my house in Christ Church, with your baggage,\r\nthe moment you reach Oxford. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz always looked back with delight on this first visit to\r\nGreat Britain. It was the beginning of his life-long friendship\r\nwith Buckland, Sedgwick, Murchison, Lyell, and others of like\r\npursuits and interests. Made welcome in many homes, he could\r\nscarcely respond to all the numerous invitations, social and\r\nscientific, which followed the Edinburgh meeting.\r\n\r\nGuided by Dr. Buckland, to whom not only every public and private\r\ncollection, but every rare specimen in the United Kingdom, seems to\r\nhave been known, he wandered from treasure to treasure. Every day\r\nbrought its revelation, until, under the accumulation of new facts,\r\nhe almost felt himself forced to begin afresh the work he had\r\nbelieved well advanced. He might have been discouraged by a wealth\r\nof resources which seemed to open countless paths, leading he knew\r\nnot whither, but for the generosity of the English naturalists who\r\nallowed him to cull, out of sixty or more collections, two thousand\r\nspecimens of fossil fishes, and to send them to London, where, by\r\nthe kindness of the Geological Society, he was permitted to deposit\r\nthem in a room in Somerset House. The mass of materials once sifted\r\nand arranged, the work of comparison and identification became\r\ncomparatively easy. He sent at once for his faithful artist, Mr.\r\nDinkel, who began, without delay, to copy all such specimens as\r\nthrew new light on the history of fossil fishes, a work which\r\ndetained him in England for several years.\r\n\r\nAgassiz made at this time two friends, whose sympathy and\r\ncooperation in his scientific work were invaluable to him for the\r\nrest of his life. Sir Philip Egerton and Lord Cole (Earl of\r\nEnniskillen) owned two of the most valuable collections of fossil\r\nfishes in Great Britain.* (* Now the property of the British\r\nMuseum.) To aid him in his researches, their most precious\r\nspecimens were placed at Agassiz's disposition; his artist was\r\nallowed to work for months on their collections, and even after\r\nAgassiz came to America, they never failed to share with him, as\r\nfar as possible, the advantages arising from the increase of their\r\nmuseums. From this time his correspondence with them, and\r\nespecially with Sir Philip Egerton, is closely connected with the\r\never-growing interest as well as with the difficulties of his\r\nscientific career. Reluctantly, and with many a backward look, he\r\nleft England in October, and returned to his lectures in Neuchatel,\r\ntaking with him such specimens as were indispensable to the\r\nprogress of his work. Every hour of the following winter which\r\ncould be spared from his lectures was devoted to his fossil fishes.\r\n\r\nA letter of this date from Professor Silliman, of New Haven,\r\nConnecticut, marks the beginning of his relations with his future\r\nNew England home, and announces his first New England subscribers.\r\n\r\nYALE COLLEGE NEW HAVEN, UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA, April 22,\r\n1835.\r\n\r\n. . .From Boston, March 6th, I had the honor to thank you for your\r\nletter of January 5th, and for your splendid present of your great\r\nwork on fossil fishes--livraison 1-22--received, with the plates. I\r\nalso gave a notice of the work in the April number of the Journal*\r\n(* \"The American Journal of Science and Arts\".) (this present\r\nmonth), and republished Mr. Bakewell's account of your visit to Mr.\r\nMantell's museum.\r\n\r\nIn Boston I made some little efforts in behalf of your work, and\r\nhave the pleasure of naming as follows:--\r\n\r\nHarvard University, Cambridge (Cambridge is only four miles from\r\nBoston), by Hon. Josiah Quincy, President.\r\n\r\nBoston Athenaeum, by its Librarian.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Green, Esquire, President of the Boston Natural History\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nI shall make application to some other institutions or individuals,\r\nbut do not venture to promise anything more than my best exertions\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz little dreamed, as he read this letter, how familiar these\r\nfar-off localities would become to him, or how often, in after\r\nyears, he would traverse by day and by night the four miles which\r\nlay between Boston and his home in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAgassiz still sought and received, as we see by the following\r\nletter, Humboldt's sympathy in every step of his work.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, May, 1835.\r\n\r\nI am to blame for my neglect of you, my dear friend, but when you\r\nconsider the grief which depresses me,* (* Owing to the death of\r\nhis brother, William von Humboldt.) and renders me unfit to keep up\r\nmy scientific connections, you will not be so unkind as to bear me\r\nany ill-will for my long silence. You are too well aware of my high\r\nesteem for your talents and your character--you know too well the\r\naffectionate friendship I bear you--to fear for a moment that you\r\ncould be forgotten.\r\n\r\nI have seen the being I loved most, and who alone gave me some\r\ninterest in this arid land, slowly decline. For four long years my\r\nbrother had suffered from a weakness of all the muscles, which made\r\nme always fear that the seat of the trouble was the medulla\r\noblongata. Yet his step was firm; his head was entirely clear. The\r\nhigher intellectual faculties retained all their energy. He was\r\nengaged from twelve to thirteen hours a day on his works, reading\r\nor rather dictating, for a nervous trembling of the hand prevented\r\nhim from using a pen. Surrounded by a numerous family; living on a\r\nspot created, so to speak, by himself, and in a house which he had\r\nadorned with antique statues; withdrawn also from affairs, he was\r\nstill attached to life. The illness which carried him off in ten\r\ndays--an inflammation of the chest--was but a secondary symptom of\r\nhis disease. He died without pain, with a strength of character and\r\na serenity of mind worthy of the greatest admiration. It is cruel\r\nto see so noble an intelligence struggle during ten long days\r\nagainst physical destruction. We are told that in great grief we\r\nshould turn with redoubled energy to the study of nature. The\r\nadvice is easy to give; but for a long time even the wish for\r\ndistraction is wanting.\r\n\r\nMy brother leaves two works which we intend to publish: one upon\r\nthe languages and ancient Indian civilization of the Asiatic\r\narchipelago, and the other upon the structure of languages in\r\ngeneral, and the influence of that structure upon the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of nations. This last work has great beauty of style.\r\nWe shall soon begin the publication of it. My brother's extensive\r\ncorrespondence with all those countries over which his philological\r\nstudies extended brings upon me just at present, such a\r\nmultiplicity of occupations and duties that I can only write you\r\nthese few lines, my dear friend, as a pledge of my constant\r\naffection, and, I may also add, my admiration of your eminent\r\nworks. It is a pleasure to watch the growing renown of those who\r\nare dear to us; and who should merit success more than you, whose\r\nelevation of character is proof against the temptations of literary\r\nself-love? I thank you for the little you have told me of your home\r\nlife. It is not enough to be praised and recognized as a great and\r\nprofound naturalist; to this one must add domestic happiness as\r\nwell. . .\r\n\r\nI am about finishing my long and wearisome work of (illegible); a\r\ncritical examinationinto the geography of the Middle Ages, of which\r\nfifty sheets are already printed. I will send you the volumes as\r\nsoon as they appear, in octavo. I devoured your fourth number; the\r\nplates are almost finer than the previous ones; and the text,\r\nthough I have only looked it through hastily, interested me deeply,\r\nespecially the analytical catalogue of Bolca, and the more general\r\nand very philosophical views of fishes in general, pages 57-64. The\r\nlatter is also remarkable in point of style. . .\r\n\r\nM. von Buch, who has just left me, sends you a warm greeting. None\r\nthe less does he consider the method of issuing your text in\r\nfragments from different volumes, altogether diabolical. I also\r\ncomplain a little, though in all humility; but I suppose it to be\r\nconnected with the difficulty of concluding any one family, when\r\nnew materials are daily accumulating on your hands. Continue then\r\nas before. In my judgment, M. Agassiz never does wrong. . .\r\n\r\nThe above letter, though written in May, did not reach Agassiz\r\nuntil the end of July, when he was again on his way to England,\r\nwhere his answer is dated.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n(LONDON), October--, 1835.\r\n\r\n. . .I cannot express to you my pleasure in reading your letter of\r\nMay 10th (which was, unhappily, only delivered to me on my passage\r\nthrough Carlsruhe, at the end of July). . .To know that I have\r\noccupied your thoughts a moment, especially in days of trial and\r\nsorrow such as you have had to bear, raises me in my own eyes, and\r\nredoubles my hope for the future. And just now such encouragement\r\nis particularly cheering under the difficulties which I meet in\r\ncompleting my task in England. I have now been here nearly two\r\nmonths, and I hope before leaving to finish the description of all\r\nthat I brought together at the Geological Society last year.\r\nKnowing that you are in Paris, however, I cannot resist the\r\ntemptation of going to see you; indeed, should your stay be\r\nprolonged for some weeks, it would be my most direct path for home.\r\nI should like to tell you a little of what I have done, and how the\r\nworld has gone with me since we last met. . .I have certainly\r\ncommitted an imprudence in throwing myself into an enterprise so\r\nvast in proportion to my means as my \"Fossil Fishes.\" But, having\r\nbegun it, I have no alternative; my only safety is in success. I\r\nhave a firm conviction that I shall bring my work to a happy issue,\r\nthough often in the evening I hardly know how the mill is to be\r\nturned to-morrow. . .\r\n\r\nBy a great good fortune for me, the British Association, at the\r\nsuggestion of Buckland, Sedgwick, and Murchison, has renewed, for\r\nthe present year, its vote of one hundred guineas toward the\r\nfacilitating of researches upon the fossil fishes of England, and I\r\nhope that a considerable part of this sum may be awarded to me, in\r\nwhich case I may be able to complete the greater number of the\r\ndrawings I need. If I had obtained in France only half the\r\nsubscriptions I have had in England, I should be afloat; but thus\r\nfar M. Bailliere has only disposed of some fifteen copies. . .My\r\nwork advances fairly; I shall soon have described all the species I\r\nknow, numbering now about nine hundred. I need some weeks in Paris\r\nfor the comparison of several tertiary species with living ones in\r\norder to satisfy myself of their specific identity, and then my\r\ntask will be accomplished. Next comes the putting in order of all\r\nmy notes. My long vacations will give me time to do this with the\r\ngreatest care. . .\r\n\r\nHis second visit to England, during which the above letter was\r\nwritten, was chiefly spent in reviewing the work of his artist,\r\nwhom he now reinforced with a second draughtsman, M. Weber, the\r\nsame who had formerly worked with him in Munich. He also attended\r\nthe meeting of the British Association in Dublin, stayed a few days\r\nat Oulton Park for another look at the collections of Sir Philip\r\nEgerton, made a second grand tour among the other fossil fishes of\r\nEngland and Ireland, and returned to Neuchatel, leaving his two\r\nartists in London with their hands more than full.\r\n\r\nWhile Agassiz thus pursued his work on fossil fishes with ardor and\r\nan almost perilous audacity, in view of his small means, he found\r\nalso time for various other investigations. During the year 1836,\r\nthough pushing forward constantly the publication of the \"Poissons\r\nFossiles,\" his \"Prodromus of the Class of Echinodermata\" appeared\r\nin the Memoirs of the Natural History Society of Neuchatel, as well\r\nas his paper on the fossil Echini belonging to the Neocomian group\r\nof the Neuchatel Jura, accompanied by figures. Not long after, he\r\npublished in the Memoirs of the Helvetic Society his descriptions\r\nof fossil Echini peculiar to Switzerland, and issued also the first\r\nnumber of a more extensive work, \"Monographie d'Echinodermes.\"\r\nDuring this year he received a new evidence of the sympathy of the\r\nEnglish naturalists, in the Wollaston medal awarded to him by the\r\nLondon Geological Society.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1836 was an eventful one for Agassiz,--the opening,\r\nindeed, of a new and brilliant chapter in his life. The attention\r\nof the ignorant and the learned had alike been called to the\r\nsingular glacial phenomena of movement and transportation in the\r\nAlpine valleys. The peasant had told his strange story of boulders\r\ncarried on the back of the ice, of the alternate retreat and\r\nadvance of glaciers, now shrinking to narrower limits, now plunging\r\nforward into adjoining fields, by some unexplained power of\r\nexpansion and contraction. Scientific men were awake to the\r\ninterest of these facts, but had considered them only as local\r\nphenomena. Venetz and Charpentier were the first to detect their\r\nwider significance. The former traced the ancient limits of the\r\nAlpine glaciers as defined by the frame-work of debris or loose\r\nmaterial they had left behind them; and Charpentier went farther,\r\nand affirmed that all the erratic boulders scattered over the plain\r\nof Switzerland and on the sides of the Jura had been thus\r\ndistributed by ice and not by water, as had been supposed.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was among those who received this hypothesis as improbable\r\nand untenable. Still, he was anxious to see the facts in place, and\r\nCharpentier was glad to be his guide. He therefore passed his\r\nvacation, during this summer of 1836, at the pretty town of Bex, in\r\nthe valley of the Rhone. Here he spent a number of weeks in\r\nexplorations, which served at the same time as a relaxation from\r\nhis more sedentary work. He went expecting to confirm his own\r\ndoubts, and to disabuse his friend Charpentier of his errors. But\r\nafter visiting with him the glaciers of the Diablerets, those of\r\nthe valley of Chamounix, and the moraines of the great valley of\r\nthe Rhone and its principal lateral valleys, he came away satisfied\r\nthat a too narrow interpretation of the phenomena was Charpentier's\r\nonly mistake.\r\n\r\nDuring this otherwise delightful summer, he was not without renewed\r\nanxiety lest he should be obliged to suspend the publication of the\r\nFossil Fishes for want of means to carry it on. On this account he\r\nwrites from Bex to Sir Philip Egerton in relation to the sale of\r\nhis original drawings, the only property he possessed. \"It is\r\nabsolutely impossible,\" he says, \"for me to issue even another\r\nnumber until this sale is effected. . .I shall consider myself more\r\nthan repaid if I receive, in exchange for the whole collection of\r\ndrawings, simply what I have expended upon them, provided I may\r\nkeep those which have yet to be lithographed until that be done.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip made every effort to effect a sale to the British\r\nMuseum. He failed at the moment, but the collection was finally\r\npurchased and presented to the British Museum by a generous\r\nrelative of his own, Lord Francis Egerton. In the mean time, Sir\r\nPhilip and Lord Cole, in order to make it possible for Agassiz to\r\nretain the services of Mr. Dinkel, proposed to pay his expenses\r\nwhile he was drawing such specimens from their own collections as\r\nwere needed for the work. These drawings were, of course, finally\r\nto remain their own property.\r\n\r\nDuring his sojourn at Bex, Agassiz's intellect and imagination had\r\nbeen deeply stirred by the glacial phenomena. In the winter of\r\n1837, on his return to Neuchatel, he investigated anew the slopes\r\nof the Jura, and found that the facts there told the same story.\r\nAlthough he resumed with unabated ardor his various works on\r\nfishes, radiates, and mollusks, a new chapter of nature was all the\r\nwhile unfolding itself in his fertile brain. When the Helvetic\r\nAssociation assembled at Neuchatel in the following summer, the\r\nyoung president, from whom the members had expected to hear new\r\ntidings of fossil fishes, startled them by the presentation of a\r\nglacial theory, in which the local erratic phenomena of the Swiss\r\nvalleys assumed a cosmic significance. It is worthy of remark here\r\nthat the first large outlines in which Agassiz, when a young man,\r\nplanned his intellectual work gave the key-note to all that\r\nfollowed. As the generalizations on which all his future zoological\r\nresearches were based, are sketched in the Preface to his \"Poissons\r\nFossiles,\" so his opening address to the Helvetic Society in 1837\r\nunfolds the glacial period as a whole, much as he saw it at the\r\nclose of his life, after he had studied the phenomena on three\r\ncontinents. In this address he announced his conviction that a\r\ngreat ice-period, due to a temporary oscillation of the temperature\r\nof the globe, had covered the surface of the earth with a sheet of\r\nice, extending at least from the north pole to Central Europe and\r\nAsia. \"Siberian winter,\" he says, \"established itself for a time\r\nover a world previously covered with a rich vegetation and peopled\r\nwith large mammalia, similar to those now inhabiting the warm\r\nregions of India and Africa. Death enveloped all nature in a\r\nshroud, and the cold, having reached its highest degree, gave to\r\nthis mass of ice, at the maximum of tension, the greatest possible\r\nhardness.\" In this novel presentation the distribution of erratic\r\nboulders, instead of being classed among local phenomena, was\r\nconsidered \"as one of the accidents accompanying the vast change\r\noccasioned by the fall of the temperature of our globe before the\r\ncommencement of our epoch.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, throwing the gauntlet down to the old expounders\r\nof erratic phenomena upon the principle of floods, freshets, and\r\nfloating ice. Many well-known geologists were present at the\r\nmeeting, among them Leopold von Buch, who could hardly contain his\r\nindignation, mingled with contempt, for what seemed to him the view\r\nof a youthful and inexperienced observer. One would have liked to\r\nhear the discussion which followed, in special section, between Von\r\nBuch, Charpentier, and Agassiz. Elie de Beaumont, who should have\r\nmade the fourth, did not arrive till later. Difference of opinion,\r\nhowever, never disturbed the cordial relation which existed between\r\nVon Buch and his young opponent. Indeed, Agassiz's reverence and\r\nadmiration for Von Buch was then, and continued throughout his\r\nlife, deep and loyal.\r\n\r\nNot alone from the men who had made these subjects their special\r\nstudy, did Agassiz meet with discouragements. The letters of his\r\nbeloved mentor, Humboldt, in 1837, show how much he regretted that\r\nany part of his young friend's energy should be diverted from\r\nzoology, to a field of investigation which he then believed to be\r\none of theory rather than of precise demonstration. He was,\r\nperhaps, partly influenced by the fact that he saw through the\r\nprejudiced eyes of his friend Von Buch. \"Over your and\r\nCharpentier's moraines,\" he says, in one of his letters, \"Leopold\r\nvon Buch rages, as you may already know, considering the subject,\r\nas he does, his exclusive property. But I too, though by no means\r\nso bitterly opposed to new views, and ready to believe that the\r\nboulders have not all been moved by the same means, am yet inclined\r\nto think the moraines due to more local causes.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter shows that Humboldt was seriously anxious lest this\r\nnew field of activity, with its fascinating speculations, should\r\ndraw Agassiz away from his ichthyological researches.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, December 2, 1837.\r\n\r\nI have this moment received, my dear friend, by the hand of M. de\r\nWerther, the cabinet minister, your eighth and ninth numbers, with\r\na fine pamphlet of text. I hasten to express my warm thanks, and I\r\ncongratulate the public on your somewhat tardy resolution to give a\r\nlarger proportion of text. One should flatter neither the king, nor\r\nthe people, nor one's dearest friend. I maintain, therefore, that\r\nno one has told you forcibly enough how the very persons who justly\r\nadmire your work, constantly complain of this fragmentary style of\r\npublication, which is the despair of those who have not the leisure\r\nto place your scattered sheets where they belong and disentangle\r\nthe skein.* (* Owing to the irregularity with which he received and\r\nwas forced to work up his material, Agassiz was often either in\r\nadvance or in arrears with certain parts of his subject, so that\r\nhis plates and his text did not keep pace with each other, thus\r\ncausing his readers much annoyance.)\r\n\r\nI think you would do well to publish for a while more text than\r\nplates. You could do this the better because your text is\r\nexcellent, full of new and important ideas, expressed with\r\nadmirable clearness. The charming letter (again without a date)\r\nwhich preceded your package impressed me painfully. I see you are\r\nill again; you complain of congestion of the head and eyes. For\r\nmercy's sake take care of your health which is so dear to us. I am\r\nafraid you work too much, and (shall I say it frankly?) that you\r\nspread your intellect over too many subjects at once. I think that\r\nyou should concentrate your moral and also your pecuniary strength\r\nupon this beautiful work on fossil fishes. In so doing you will\r\nrender a greater service to positive geology, than by these general\r\nconsiderations (a little icy withal) on the revolutions of the\r\nprimitive world; considerations which, as you well know, convince\r\nonly those who give them birth. In accepting considerable sums from\r\nEngland, you have, so to speak, contracted obligations to be met\r\nonly by completing a work which will be at once a monument to your\r\nown glory and a landmark in the history of science. Admirable and\r\nexact as your researches on other fossils are, your contemporaries\r\nclaim from you the fishes above all. You will say that this is\r\nmaking you the slave of others; perfectly true, but such is the\r\npleasing position of affairs here below. Have I not been driven for\r\nthirty-three years to busy myself with that tiresome America, and\r\nam I not, even yet, daily insulted because, after publishing\r\nthirty-two volumes of the great edition in folio and in quarto, and\r\ntwelve hundred plates, one volume of the historical section is\r\nwanting? We men of letters are the servants of an arbitrary master,\r\nwhom we have imprudently chosen, who flatters and pets us first,\r\nand then tyrannizes over us if we do not work to his liking. You\r\nsee, my dear friend, I play the grumbling old man, and, at the risk\r\nof deeply displeasing you, place myself on the side of the despotic\r\npublic. . .\r\n\r\nWith reference to the general or periodical lowering of the\r\ntemperature of the globe, I have never thought it necessary, on\r\naccount of the elephant of the Lena, to admit that sudden frost of\r\nwhich Cuvier used to speak. What I have seen in Siberia, and what\r\nhas been observed in Captain Beechey's expedition on the northwest\r\ncoast of America, simply proves that there exists a layer of frozen\r\ndrift, in the fissures of which (even now) the muscular flesh of\r\nany animal which should accidentally fall into them would be\r\npreserved intact. It is a slight local phenomenon. To me, the\r\nensemble of geological phenomena seems to prove, not the prevalence\r\nof this glacial surface on which you would carry along your\r\nboulders, but a very high temperature spreading almost to the\r\npoles, a temperature favorable to organizations resembling those\r\nnow living in the tropics. Your ice frightens me, and gladly as I\r\nwould welcome you here, my dear friend, I think, perhaps, for the\r\nsake of your health, and also that you may not see this country,\r\nalways so hideous, under a sheet of snow and ice (in February), you\r\nwould do better to come two months later, with the first verdure.\r\nThis is suggested by a letter received yesterday by M. d'O--, which\r\nalarmed me a little, because the state of your eyes obliged you to\r\nwrite by another hand. Pray do not think of traveling before you\r\nare quite well. I close this letter, feeling sure that it does not\r\ncontain a line which is not an expression of friendship and of the\r\nhigh esteem I bear you. The magnificence of your last numbers,\r\neight and nine, cannot be told. How admirably executed are your\r\nMacropoma, the Ophiopris procerus, Mantell's great beast, the\r\nminute details of the Dercetis, Psammodus,. . .the skeletons. . .\r\nThere is nothing like it in all that we possess upon vertebrates. I\r\nhave also begun to study your text, so rich in well arranged facts;\r\nthe monograph of the Lepidostei, the passage upon the bony rays,\r\nand, dear Agassiz, I could hardly believe my eyes, sixty-five\r\ncontinuous pages of the third volume, without interruption! You\r\nwill spoil the public. But, my good friend, you have already\r\ninformation upon a thousand species; \"claudite jam rivos!\" You say\r\nyour work can go on if you have two hundred subscribers; but if you\r\ncontinue to support two traveling draughtsmen, I predict, as a\r\npractical man, that it cannot go on. You cannot even publish what\r\nyou have gathered in the last five years. Consider that in\r\nattempting to give a review of all the fossil fishes which now\r\nexist in collections, you pursue a phantom which ever flies before\r\nyou. Such a work would not be finished in less than fifteen years,\r\nand besides, this NOW is an uncertain element. Cannot you conquer\r\nyourself so far as to finish what you have in your possession at\r\npresent? Recall your artists. With the reputation you enjoy in\r\nEurope, whatever might essentially change your opinion on certain\r\norganisms would willingly be sent to you. If you continue to keep\r\ntwo ambassadors in foreign lands, the means you destine for the\r\nengraving and printing will soon be absorbed. You will struggle\r\nwith domestic difficulties, and at sixty years of age (tremble at\r\nthe sight of this number!) you will be as uncertain as you are\r\nto-day, whether you possess, even in your collection of drawings,\r\nall that is to be found among amateurs. How exhaust an ocean in\r\nwhich the species are indefinitely increasing? Finish, first, what\r\nyou have this December, 1837, and then, if the subject does not\r\nweary you, publish the supplements in 1847. You must not forget\r\nthat these supplements will be of two kinds: 1st. Ideas which\r\nmodify some of your old views. 2nd. New species. Only the first\r\nkind of supplement would be really desirable. Furthermore, you must\r\nregain your intellectual independence and not let yourself be\r\nscolded any more by M. de Humboldt. Little will it avail you should\r\nI vanish from the scene of this world with your fourteenth number!\r\nWhen I am a fossil in my turn I shall still appear to you as a\r\nghost, having under my arm the pages you have failed to interpolate\r\nand the volume of that eternal America which I owe to the public. I\r\nclose with a touch of fun, in order that my letter may seem a\r\nlittle less like preaching. A thousand affectionate remembrances.\r\nNo more ice, not much of echinoderms, plenty of fish, recall of\r\nambassadors in partibus, and great severity toward the\r\nbook-sellers, an infernal race, two or three of whom have been\r\nkilled under me.\r\n\r\nA. DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nI sigh to think of the trouble my horrible writing will give you.\r\n\r\nA letter of about the same date from Von Buch shows that, however\r\nhe might storm at Agassiz's heterodox geology, he was in full\r\nsympathy with his work in general.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD VON BUCH TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nDecember 22, 1837.\r\n\r\n. . .Pray reinstate me in the good graces of my unknown benefactor\r\namong you. By a great mistake the reports of the Society forwarded\r\nto me from Neuchatel have been sent back. As it is well known at\r\nthe post-office that I do not keep the piles of educational\r\njournals sent to me from France, the postage on them being much too\r\nheavy for my means, they took it for granted that this journal, the\r\ncharges on which amounted to several crowns, was of the number. I\r\nam very sorry. I do not even know the contents of the journal, but\r\nI suppose it contained papers of yours, full of genius and ardor. I\r\nlike your way of looking at nature, and I think you render great\r\nservice to science by your observations. A right spirit will\r\nreadily lead you to see that this is the true road to glory, far\r\npreferable to the one which leads to vain analogies and\r\nspeculations, the time for which is long past. I am grieved to hear\r\nthat you are not well, and that your eyes refuse their service. M.\r\nde Humboldt tells me that you are seeking a better climate here, in\r\nthe month of February. You may find it, perhaps, thanks to our\r\nstoves. But as we shall still have plenty of ice in the streets,\r\nyour glacial opinions will not find a market at that season. I\r\nshould like to present you with a memoir or monograph of mine, just\r\npublished, on Spirifer and Orthis, but I will take good care to let\r\nno one pay postage on a work which, by its nature, can have but a\r\nvery limited interest. . .I will await your arrival to give you\r\nthese descriptions. I am expecting the numbers of your Fossil\r\nFishes, which have not yet come. Humboldt often speaks of them to\r\nme. Ah! how much I prefer you in a field which is wholly your own\r\nthan in one where you break in upon the measured and cautious\r\ntread, introduced by Saussure in geology. You, too, will reconsider\r\nall this, and will yet treat the views of Saussure and Escher with\r\nmore respect. Everything here turns to infusoria. Ehrenberg has\r\njust discovered that an apparently sandy deposit, twenty feet in\r\nthickness, under the \"Luneburgerheyde,\" is composed entirely of\r\ninfusoria of a kind still living in the neighborhood of Berlin.\r\nThis layer rests upon a brown deposit known to be ten feet in\r\nthickness. The latter consists, for one fifth of the depth, of pine\r\npollen, which burns. The rest is of infusoria. Thus these animals,\r\nwhich the naked eye has not power to discern, have themselves the\r\npower to build up mountain chains. . .\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n1837-1839: AGE 30-32.\r\n\r\nInvitation to Professorships at Geneva and Lausanne.\r\nDeath of his Father.\r\nEstablishment of Lithographic Press at Neuchatel.\r\nResearches upon Structure of Mollusks.\r\nInternal Casts of Shells.\r\nGlacial Explorations.\r\nViews of Buckland.\r\nRelations with Arnold Guyot.\r\nTheir Work together in the Alps.\r\nLetter to Sir Philip Egerton concerning Glacial Work.\r\nSummer of 1839.\r\nPublication of \"Etudes sur les Glaciers.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Agassiz's daring treatment of the glacial phenomena had\r\nexcited much opposition and angry comment, it had also made a\r\npowerful impression by its eloquence and originality. To this may\r\nbe partly due the fact that about this time he was strongly urged\r\nfrom various quarters to leave Neuchatel for some larger field. One\r\nof the most seductive of these invitations, owing to the\r\naffectionate spirit in which it was offered, came through Monsieur\r\nde la Rive, in Geneva.\r\n\r\nM. AUGUSTE DE LA RIVE TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nGENEVA, May 12, 1836.\r\n\r\n. . .I have not yet received your address. I hope you will send it\r\nto me without delay, for I am anxious to bring it before our\r\nreaders. I hope also that you will not forget what you have\r\npromised me for the \"Bibliotheque Universelle.\" I am exceedingly\r\nanxious to have your cooperation; the more so that it will\r\nreinforce that of several distinguished savants whose assistance I\r\nhave recently secured.\r\n\r\nIf I weary you with a second letter, however, it is not only to\r\nremind you of your promise about the \"Bibliotheque Universelle,\"\r\nbut for another object still more important and urgent. The matter\r\nstands thus. Our academic courses have just opened under favorable\r\nauspices. The number of students is much increased, and,\r\nespecially, we have a good many from Germany and England. This\r\ncircumstance makes us feel more strongly the importance of\r\ncompleting our organization, and of doing this wisely and quickly.\r\nI will not play the diplomat with you, but will frankly say,\r\nwithout circumlocution, that you seem to me the one essential, the\r\none indispensable man. After having talked with some influential\r\npersons here, I feel sure that if you say to me, \"I will come,\" I\r\ncan obtain for you the following conditions: 1st. A regular salary\r\nof three thousand francs, beside the student fees, which, in view\r\nof the character of your instruction, your reputation, and the\r\nnovelty of your course, I place too low at a thousand francs; of\r\nthis I am convinced. 2nd. The vacant professorship is one of\r\ngeology and mineralogy, but should you wish it De la Planche will\r\ncontinue to teach the mineralogy, and you will replace it by\r\npaleontology, or any other subject which may suit you. . .Add to\r\nthis resource that of a popular course for the world outside,\r\nladies and others, which you might give in the winter, as at\r\nNeuchatel. The custom here is to pay fifty francs for the course of\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty lectures. You will easily see that for\r\nsuch a course you would have at least as large an audience here as\r\nat Neuchatel. This is the more likely because there is a demand for\r\nthese courses, Pictet being dead, and M. Rossi and M. de Castella\r\nhaving ceased to give them. No one has come forward as their heir,\r\nfine as the inheritance is; some are too busy, others have not the\r\nkind of talent needed, and none have attempted to replace these\r\ngentlemen in this especial line, one in which you excel, both by\r\nyour gifts and your fortunate choice of a subject more in vogue\r\njust now than any other. Come then, to work in this rich vein\r\nbefore others present themselves for the same purpose. Finally,\r\nsince I must make up your budget, the \"Bibliotheque Universelle,\"\r\nwhich pays fifty francs a sheet, would be always open to you; there\r\nyou could bring the fruits of your productive leisure. Certainly it\r\nwould be easy for you to make in this way an additional thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a statement, precise and full, of the condition of\r\nthings, and of what you may hope to find here. The moment is\r\npropitious; there is a movement among us just now in favor of the\r\nsciences, and this winter the plan of a large building for our\r\nmuseum and library will be presented to our common council. The\r\nwork should begin next summer; you well know how much we should\r\nvalue your ideas and your advice on this subject. There may also be\r\nquestion of a director for the museum, and of an apartment for him\r\nin the new edifice; you will not doubt to whom such a place would\r\nbe offered. But let us not draw upon the future; let us limit\r\nourselves to the present, and see whether what I propose suits you\r\n. . .Come! let yourself be persuaded. Sacrifice the capital to a\r\nprovincial town. At Berlin, no doubt, you would be happy and\r\nhonored; at Geneva, you would be the happiest, the most honored.\r\nLook at--, who shone as a star of the first magnitude at Geneva,\r\nand who is but a star of second or third rank in Paris. This, to be\r\nsure, would not be your case; nevertheless, I am satisfied that at\r\nGeneva, where you would be a second de Saussure, your position\r\nwould be still more brilliant. I know that these motives of\r\nscientific self-love have little weight with you; nevertheless,\r\nwishing to omit nothing, I give them for what they are worth. But\r\nmy hope rests far more on the arguments I have first presented;\r\nthey come from the heart, and with you the heart responds as\r\nreadily as the genius. But enough! I will not fatigue you with\r\nfarther considerations. I think I have given you all the points\r\nnecessary for your decision. Be so kind as to let me know as soon\r\nas possible what you intend to do. Have the kindness also not to\r\nspeak of the contents of this letter, and remember that it is not\r\nthe Rector of the Academy of Geneva, but the Professor Auguste de\r\nla Rive, who writes in his own private person. Promptitude and\r\nsilence, then, are the two recommendations which I make to you\r\nwhile we await the Yes we so greatly desire. . .\r\n\r\nMore tempting still must have been the official invitation received\r\na few months later to a professorship at Lausanne, strengthened as\r\nit was by the affectionate entreaties of relations and friends,\r\nurging him for the sake of family ties and patriotism to return to\r\nthe canton where he had passed his earlier years. But he had cast\r\nin his lot with the Neuchatelois and was proof against all\r\narguments. He remained faithful to the post he had chosen until he\r\nleft it, temporarily as he then believed, to come to America. The\r\ncitizens of his adopted town expressed their appreciation of his\r\nloyalty to them in a warm letter of thanks, begging, at the same\r\ntime, his acceptance of the sum of six thousand francs, payable by\r\ninstallments during three years.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1837 was a sad one to Agassiz and to his whole\r\nfamily; his father died at Concise, carried off by a fever while\r\nstill a comparatively young man. The pretty parsonage, to which\r\nthey were so much attached, passed into other hands, and\r\nthenceforward the home of Madame Agassiz was with her children,\r\namong whom she divided her time.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Agassiz founded a lithographic printing establishment in\r\nNeuchatel, which was carried on for many years under his direction.\r\nThus far his plates had been lithographed in Munich. Their\r\nexecution at such a distance involved constant annoyance, and\r\nsometimes great waste of time and money, in sending the proofs to\r\nand fro for correction. The scheme of establishing a lithographic\r\npress, to be in a great degree at his charge, was certainly an\r\nimprudent one for a poor man; but Agassiz hoped not only to\r\nfacilitate his own publications by this means, but also to raise\r\nthe standard of execution in works of a purely scientific\r\ncharacter. Supported partly by his own exertions, partly by the\r\ngenerosity of others, the establishment was almost exclusively\r\ndependent upon him for its unceasing activity. He was fortunate in\r\nsecuring for its head M. Hercule Nicolet, a very able lithographic\r\nartist, who had had much experience in engraving objects of natural\r\nhistory, and was specially versed in the recently invented art of\r\nchromatic lithography.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was now driving all his steeds abreast. Beside his duties\r\nas professor, he was printing at the same time his \"Fossil Fishes,\"\r\nhis \"Fresh-Water Fishes,\" and his investigations on fossil\r\nEchinoderms and Mollusks,--the illustrations for all these various\r\nworks being under his daily supervision. The execution of these\r\nplates, under M. Nicolet's care, was admirable for the period.\r\nProfessor Arnold Guyot, in his memoir of Agassiz, says of the\r\nplates for the \"Fresh-Water Fishes\": \"We wonder at their beauty,\r\nand at their perfection of color and outline, when we remember that\r\nthey were almost the first essays of the newly-invented art of\r\nlithochromy, produced at a time when France and Belgium were\r\nshowering rewards on very inferior work of the kind, as the\r\nforemost specimens of progress in the art.\"\r\n\r\nAll this work could hardly be carried on single handed. In 1837 M.\r\nEdouard Desor joined Agassiz in Neuchatel, and became for many\r\nyears his intimate associate in scientific labors. A year or two\r\nlater M. Charles Vogt also united himself to the band of\r\ninvestigators and artists who had clustered about Agassiz as their\r\ncentral force. M. Ernest Favre says of this period of his life: \"He\r\ndisplayed during these years an incredible energy, of which the\r\nhistory of science offers, perhaps, no other example.\"\r\n\r\nAmong his most important zoological researches at this time were\r\nthose upon mollusks. His method of studying this class was too\r\noriginal and too characteristic to be passed by without notice. The\r\nscience of conchology had heretofore been based almost wholly upon\r\nthe study of the empty shells. To Agassiz this seemed superficial.\r\nLonging to know more of the relation between the animal and its\r\nouter covering, he bethought himself that the inner moulding of the\r\nshell would give at least the form of its old inhabitant. For the\r\npractical work he engaged an admirable moulder, M. Stahl, who\r\ncontinued to be one of his staff at the lithographic establishment\r\nuntil he became permanently employed at the Jardin des Plantes.\r\nWith his help and that of M. Henri Ladame, professor of physics and\r\nchemistry at Neuchatel, who prepared the delicate metal alloys in\r\nwhich the first mould was taken, Agassiz obtained casts in which\r\nthe form of the animals belonging to the shells was perfectly\r\nreproduced. This method has since passed into universal use. By its\r\naid he obtained a new means of ascertaining the relations between\r\nfossil and living mollusks. It was of vast service to him in\r\npreparing his \"Etudes critiques sur les Mollusques fossiles,\"--a\r\nquarto volume with nearly one hundred plates.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Sir Philip Egerton gives some account of\r\nhis undertakings at this time, and of the difficulties entailed\r\nupon him by their number and variety.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, August 10, 1838.\r\n\r\n. . .These last months have been a time of trial to me, and I have\r\nbeen forced to give up my correspondence completely in order to\r\nmeet the ever-increasing demands of my work. You know how difficult\r\nit is to find a quiet moment and an easy mind for writing, when one\r\nis pursued by printing or lithographic proofs, and forced besides\r\nto prepare unceasing occupation for numerous employees. Add to this\r\nthe close research required by the work of editing, and you surely\r\nwill find an excuse for my delay. I think I have already written\r\nyou that in order to have everything under my own eye, I had\r\nfounded a lithographic establishment at Neuchatel in the hope of\r\navoiding in future the procrastinations to which my proofs were\r\nliable when the work was done at Munich. . .I hope that my new\r\npublications will be sufficiently well received to justify me in\r\nsupporting an establishment unique of its kind, which I have\r\nfounded solely in the interest of science and at the risk of my\r\npeace and my health. If I give you all these details, it is simply\r\nto explain my silence, which was caused not by pure negligence, but\r\nby the demands of an undertaking in the success of which my very\r\nexistence is involved. . .This week I shall forward to the\r\nSecretary of the British Association for the Advancement of Science\r\nall that I have been able to do thus far, being unable to bring it\r\nmyself, as I had hoped. You would oblige me greatly if you would\r\ngive a look at these different works, which may, I hope, have\r\nvarious claims on your interest. First, there is the tenth number\r\nof the \"Fossil Fishes,\" though the whole supply of publisher's\r\ncopies will only be sent a few weeks later. Then there are the\r\nseven first plates of my sea-urchins, engraved with much care and\r\nwith many details. A third series of plates relates to critical\r\nstudies on fossil mollusks, little or erroneously known, and on\r\ntheir internal casts. This is a quite novel side of the study of\r\nshells, and will throw light on the organization of animals known\r\nhitherto only by the shell. I have made a plaster collection of\r\nthem for the Geological Society. They have been packed some time,\r\nbut my late journey to Paris has prevented me from forwarding them\r\ntill now. As soon as I have a moment, I shall make out the\r\ncatalogue and send it on. When you go to London, do not fail to\r\nexamine them; the result is curious enough. Finally, the plates for\r\nthe first number of my \"Fresh-Water Fishes\" are in great part\r\nfinished, and also included in my package for Newcastle. . .The\r\nplates are executed by a new process, and printed in various tints\r\non different stones, resulting in a remarkable uniformity of\r\ncoloring in all the impressions. . .\r\n\r\nSuch are the new credentials with which I present myself, as I\r\nbring my thanks for the honor paid to me by my nomination for the\r\nvacancy in the Royal Society of London. If unbounded devotion to\r\nthe interests of science constituted a sufficient title to such a\r\ndistinction, I should be the less surprised at the announcement\r\ncontained in your last letter. The action of the Royal Society, so\r\nflattering to the candidate of your choice, has satisfied a desire\r\nwhich I should hardly have dared to form for many a year,--that of\r\nbecoming a member of a body so illustrious as the Royal Society of\r\nLondon. . .\r\n\r\nEach time I write I wish I could close with the hope of seeing you\r\nsoon; but I must work incessantly; that is my lot, and the\r\nhappiness I find in it gives a charm to my occupations however\r\nnumerous they may be. . .\r\n\r\nWhile Agassiz's various zoological works were thus pressed with\r\nunceasing activity, the glaciers and their attendant phenomena,\r\nwhich had so captivated his imagination, were ever present to his\r\nthought. In August of the year 1838, a year after he had announced\r\nat the meeting of the Helvetic Society his comprehensive theory\r\nrespecting the action of ice over the whole northern hemisphere, he\r\nmade two important excursions in the Alps. The first was to the\r\nvalley of Hassli, the second to the glaciers of Mont Blanc. In both\r\nhe was accompanied by his scientific collaborator, M. Desor, whose\r\nintrepidity and ardor hardly fell short of his own; by Mr. Dinkel\r\nas artist, and by one or two students and friends. These excursions\r\nwere a kind of prelude to his more prolonged sojourns on the Alps,\r\nand to the series of observations carried on by him and his\r\ncompanions, which attracted so much attention in later years. But\r\nthough Agassiz carried with him, on these first explorations, only\r\nthe simplest means of investigation and experiment, they were no\r\namateur excursions. On these first Alpine journeys he had in his\r\nmind the sketch he meant to fill out. The significance of the\r\nphenomena was already clear to him. What he sought was the\r\nconnection. Following the same comparative method, he intended to\r\ntrack the footsteps of the ice as he had gathered and put together\r\nthe fragments of his fossil fishes, till the scattered facts should\r\nfall into their natural order once more and tell their story from\r\nbeginning to end.\r\n\r\nIn his explorations of 1838 he found everywhere the same phenomena;\r\nthe grooved and polished and graven surfaces and the rounded and\r\nmodeled rocks, often lying far above and beyond the present limits\r\nof the glaciers; the old moraines, long deserted by the ice, but\r\ndefining its ancient frontiers; the erratic blocks, transported far\r\nfrom their place of origin and disposed in an order and position\r\nunexplained by the agency of water.\r\n\r\nThese excursions, though not without their dangers and fatigues,\r\nwere full of charm for men who, however serious their aims, were\r\nstill young enough to enter like boys into the spirit of adventure.\r\nAgassiz himself was but thirty-one; an ardent pedestrian, he\r\ndelighted in feats of walking and climbing. His friend Dinkel\r\nrelates that one day, while pausing at Grindelwald for refreshment,\r\nthey met an elderly traveler who asked him, after listening awhile\r\nto their gay talk, in which appeals were constantly made to\r\n\"Agassiz,\" if that was perhaps the son of the celebrated professor\r\nof Neuchatel. The answer amazed him; he could hardly believe that\r\nthe young man before him was the naturalist of European reputation.\r\nIn connection with this journey occurs the first attempt at an\r\nEnglish letter found among Agassiz's papers. It is addressed to\r\nBuckland, and contains this passage: \"Since I saw the glaciers I am\r\nquite of a snowy humor, and will have the whole surface of the\r\nearth covered with ice, and the whole prior creation dead by cold.\r\nIn fact, I am quite satisfied that ice must be taken [included] in\r\nevery complete explanation of the last changes which occurred at\r\nthe surface of Europe.\" Considered in connection with their\r\nsubsequent work together in the ancient ice-beds and moraines of\r\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, it is curious to find\r\nBuckland answering: \"I am sorry that I cannot entirely adopt the\r\nnew theory you advocate to explain transported blocks by moraines;\r\nfor supposing it adequate to explain the phenomena of Switzerland,\r\nit would not apply to the granite blocks and transported gravel of\r\nEngland, which I can only explain by referring to currents of\r\nwater.\" During the same summer Mrs. Buckland writes from\r\nInterlaken, in the course of a journey in Switzerland with her\r\nhusband. . .\"We have made a good tour of the Oberland and have seen\r\nglaciers, etc., but Dr. Buckland is as far as ever from agreeing\r\nwith you.\" We shall see hereafter how completely he became a\r\nconvert to Agassiz's glacial theory in its widest acceptation.\r\n\r\nOne friend, scarcely mentioned thus far in this biography, was yet,\r\nfrom the beginning, the close associate of Agassiz's glacier work.\r\nArnold Guyot and he had been friends from boyhood. Their university\r\nlife separated them for a time, Guyot being at Berlin while Agassiz\r\nwas at Munich, and they became colleagues at Neuchatel only after\r\nAgassiz had been for some years established there. From that time\r\nforward there was hardly any break in their intercourse; they came\r\nto America at about the same time, and finally settled as\r\nprofessors, the one at Harvard College, in Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, and the other at the College of New Jersey, in\r\nPrinceton. They shared all their scientific interests; and when\r\nthey were both old men, Guyot brought to Agassiz's final\r\nundertaking, the establishment of a summer school at Penikese, a\r\ncooperation as active and affectionate as that he had given in his\r\nyouth to his friend's scheme for establishing a permanent\r\nscientific summer station in the high Alps.\r\n\r\nIn a short visit made by Agassiz to Paris in the spring of 1838 he\r\nunfolded his whole plan to Guyot, then residing there, and\r\npersuaded him to undertake a certain part of the investigation.\r\nDuring this very summer of 1838, therefore, while Agassiz was\r\ntracing the ancient limits of the ice in the Bernese Oberland and\r\nthe Haut Valais, and later, in the valley of Chamounix, Guyot was\r\nstudying the structure and movement of the ice during a six weeks'\r\ntour in the central Alps. At the conclusion of their respective\r\njourneys they met to compare notes, at the session of the\r\nGeological Society of France, at Porrentruy, where Agassiz made a\r\nreport upon the general results of his summer's work; while Guyot\r\nread a paper, the contents of which have never been fully\r\npublished, upon the movement of glaciers and upon their internal\r\nfeatures, including the laminated structure of the ice, the\r\nso-called blue bands, deep down in the mass of the glacier.* (* See\r\n\"Memoir of Louis Agassiz\" by Arnold Guyot, written for the United\r\nStates National Academy of Sciences, page 38.) In the succeeding\r\nyears of their glacial researches together, Guyot took for his\r\nshare the more special geological problems, the distribution of\r\nerratic boulders and of the glacial drift, as connected with the\r\nancient extension of the glaciers. This led him away from the\r\ncentral station of observation to remoter valleys on the northern\r\nand southern slopes of the Alps, where he followed the descent of\r\nthe glacial phenomena to the plains of central Europe on the one\r\nside and to those of northern Italy on the other. We therefore\r\nseldom hear of him with the band of workers who finally settled on\r\nthe glacier of the Aar, because his share of the undertaking became\r\na more isolated one. It was nevertheless an integral part of the\r\noriginal scheme, which was carried on connectedly to the end, the\r\nresults of the work in the different departments being constantly\r\nreported and compared. So much was this the case, that the\r\nintention of Agassiz had been to embody the whole in a publication,\r\nthe first part of which should contain the glacial system of\r\nAgassiz; the second the Alpine erratics, by Guyot; while the third\r\nand final portion, by E. Desor, should treat of the erratic\r\nphenomena outside of Switzerland. The first volume alone was\r\ncompleted. Unlooked for circumstances made the continuation of the\r\nwork impossible, and the five thousand specimens of the erratic\r\nrocks of Switzerland collected by Professor Guyot, in preparation\r\nfor his part of the publication, are now deposited in the College\r\nof New Jersey, at Princeton.\r\n\r\nIn the following summer of 1839 Agassiz took the chain of Monte\r\nRosa and Matterhorn as the field of a larger and more systematic\r\nobservation. On this occasion, the usual party consisting of\r\nAgassiz, Desor, M. Bettanier, an artist, and two or three other\r\nfriends, was joined by the geologist Studer. Up to this time he had\r\nbeen a powerful opponent of Agassiz's views, and his conversion to\r\nthe glacial theory during this excursion was looked upon by them\r\nall as a victory greater than any gained over the regions of ice\r\nand snow. Some account of this journey occurs in the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, September 10, 1839.\r\n\r\n. . .Under these circumstances, I thought I could not do better\r\nthan to pass some weeks in the solitude of the high Alps; I lived\r\nabout a fortnight in the region of the glaciers, ascending some new\r\nfield of ice every day, and trying to scale the sides of our\r\nhighest peaks. I thus examined in succession all the glaciers\r\ndescending from the majestic summits of Monte Rosa and the\r\nMatterhorn, whose numerous crests form a most gigantic\r\namphitheatre, which lifts itself above the everlasting snow.\r\nAfterward I visited the sea of ice which, under the name of the\r\nglacier of Aletsch, flows from the Jungfrau, the Monch, and the\r\nEiger toward Brieg; thence I went to the glacier of the Rhone, and\r\nfrom there, establishing my headquarters at the Hospice of the\r\nGrimsel, I followed the glacier of the Aar to the foot of the\r\nFinsteraarhorn. There I ascertained the most important fact that I\r\nnow know concerning the advance of glaciers, namely, that the cabin\r\nconstructed by Hugi in 1827, at the foot of the Abschwung, is now\r\nfour thousand feet lower down. Slight as is the inclination of the\r\nglacier, this cabin has been carried on by the ice with astonishing\r\nrapidity, and still more important is it that this rapidity has\r\nbeen on the increase; for in 1830 the cabin was only some hundred\r\nfeet from the rock, in 1836 it had already passed over a distance\r\nfrom [word torn away] of two thousand feet, and in the last three\r\nyears it has again doubled that distance. Not only have I confirmed\r\nmy views upon glaciers and their attendant phenomena, on this new\r\nground, but I have completed my examination of a number of details,\r\nand have had besides the satisfaction of convincing one of my most\r\nsevere opponents of the exactness of my observations, namely, M.\r\nStuder, who accompanied me on a part of these excursions. . .\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1840 was fully occupied by the preparation for the\r\npublication of the \"Etudes sur les Glaciers,\" which appeared before\r\nthe year was out, accompanied by an atlas of thirty-two plates. The\r\nvolume of text consisted of an historical resume of all that had\r\npreviously been done in the study of glaciers, followed by an\r\naccount of the observations of Agassiz and his companions during\r\nthe last three or four years upon the glaciers of the Alps. Their\r\nstructure, external aspect, needles, tables, perched blocks, gravel\r\ncones, rifts, and crevasses, as well as their movements, mode of\r\nformation, and internal temperature, were treated in succession.\r\nBut the most interesting chapters, from the author's own point of\r\nview, and those which were most novel for his readers, were the\r\nconcluding ones upon the ancient extension of the Swiss glaciers,\r\nand upon the former existence of an immense, unbroken sheet of ice,\r\nwhich had once covered the whole northern hemisphere. No one before\r\nhad drawn such vast conclusions from the local phenomena of the\r\nAlpine valleys. \"The surface of Europe,\" says Agassiz, \"adorned\r\nbefore by a tropical vegetation and inhabited by troops of large\r\nelephants, enormous hippopotami, and gigantic carnivora, was\r\nsuddenly buried under a vast mantle of ice, covering alike plains,\r\nlakes, seas and plateaus. Upon the life and movement of a powerful\r\ncreation fell the silence of death. Springs paused, rivers ceased\r\nto flow, the rays of the sun, rising upon this frozen shore (if,\r\nindeed, it was reached by them), were met only by the breath of the\r\nwinter from the north and the thunders of the crevasses as they\r\nopened across the surface of this icy sea.\"* (* \"Etudes sur les\r\nGlaciers\" Chapter 8 page 35.) The author goes on to state that on\r\nthe breaking up of this universal shroud the ice must have lingered\r\nlongest in mountainous strongholds, and that all these fastnesses\r\nof retreat became, as the Alps are now, centres of distribution for\r\nthe broken debris and rocky fragments which are found scattered\r\nwith a kind of regularity along certain lines, and over given areas\r\nin northern and central Europe. How he followed out this idea in\r\nhis subsequent investigations will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n1840-1842: AGE 33-35.\r\n\r\nSummer Station on the Glacier of the Aar.\r\nHotel des Neuchatelois.\r\nMembers of the Party.\r\nWork on the Glacier.\r\nAscent of the Strahleck and the Siedelhorn.\r\nVisit to England.\r\nSearch for Glacial Remains in Great Britain.\r\nRoads of Glen Roy.\r\nViews of English Naturalists concerning Agassiz's Glacial Theory.\r\nLetter from Humboldt.\r\nWinter Visit to Glacier.\r\nSummer of 1841 on the Glacier.\r\nDescent into the Glacier.\r\nAscent of the Jungfrau.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1840 Agassiz made his first permanent station on\r\nthe Alps. Hitherto the external phenomena, the relation of the ice\r\nto its surroundings, and its influence upon them, had been the\r\nchief study. Now the glacier itself was to be the main subject of\r\ninvestigation, and he took with him a variety of instruments for\r\ntesting temperatures: barometers, thermometers, hygrometers, and\r\npsychometers; beside a boring apparatus, by means of which\r\nself-registering thermometers might be lowered into the heart of\r\nthe glacier. To these were added microscopes for the study of such\r\ninsects and plants as might be found in these ice-bound regions.\r\nThe Hospice of the Grimsel was selected as his base of supplies,\r\nand as guides Jacob Leuthold and Johann Wahren were chosen. Both of\r\nthese had accompanied Hugi in his ascension of the Finsteraarhorn\r\nin 1828, and both were therefore thoroughly familiar with all the\r\ndangers of Alpine climbing. The lower Aar glacier was to be the\r\nscene of their continuous work, and the centre from which their\r\nascents of the neighboring summits would be made. Here, on the\r\ngreat median moraine, stood a huge boulder of micaceous schist. Its\r\nupper surface projected so as to form a roof, and by closing it in\r\non one side with a stone wall, leveling the floor by a judicious\r\narrangement of flat slabs, and rigging a blanket in front to serve\r\nas a curtain across the entrance, the whole was presently\r\ntransformed into a rude hut, where six persons could find\r\nsleeping-room. A recess, sheltered by the rock outside, served as\r\nkitchen and dining-room; while an empty space under another large\r\nboulder was utilized as a cellar for the keeping of provisions.\r\nThis was the abode so well known afterward as the Hotel des\r\nNeuchatelois. Its first occupants were Louis Agassiz, Edouard\r\nDesor, Charles Vogt, Francois de Pourtales, Celestin Nicolet, and\r\nHenri Coulon. It afforded, perhaps, as good a shelter as they could\r\nhave found in the old cabin of Hugi, where they had hoped to make\r\ntheir temporary home. In this they were disappointed, for the cabin\r\nhad crumbled on its last glacial journey. The wreck was lying two\r\nhundred feet below the spot where they had seen the walls still\r\nstanding the year before.\r\n\r\nThe work was at once distributed among the different members of the\r\nparty,--Agassiz himself, assisted by his young friend and favorite\r\npupil, Francois de Pourtales, retaining for his own share the\r\nmeteorological observations, and especially those upon the internal\r\ntemperature of the glaciers.* (* See \"Tables of Temperature,\r\nMeasurements\" etc., in Agassiz's \"Systeme Glaciaire\". These results\r\nare also recorded in a volume entitled \"Sejours dans les Glaciers\",\r\nby Edouard Desor, a collection of very bright and entertaining\r\narticles upon the excursions and sojourns made in the Alps, during\r\nsuccessive summers, by Agassiz and his scientific staff.) To M.\r\nVogt fell the microscopic study of the red snow and the organic\r\nlife contained in it; to M. Nicolet, the flora of the glaciers and\r\nthe surrounding rocks; to M. Desor, the glacial phenomena proper,\r\nincluding those of the moraines. He had the companionship and\r\nassistance of M. Henri Coulon in the long and laborious excursions\r\nrequired for this part of the work.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for scientific details. For the results of\r\nAgassiz's researches on the Alpine glaciers, to which he devoted\r\nmuch of his time and energy during ten years, from 1836 to 1846,\r\nthe reader is referred to his two larger works on this subject, the\r\n\"Etudes sur les Glaciers,\" and the \"Systeme Glaciaire.\" Of the work\r\naccomplished by him and his companions during these years this\r\nslight summary is given by his friend Guyot.* (* See Biographical\r\nSketch, published by Professor A. Guyot, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited States National Academy.) \"The position of eighteen of the\r\nmost prominent rocks on the glacier was determined by careful\r\ntriangulation by a skillful engineer, and measured year after year\r\nto establish the rate of motion of every part. The differences in\r\nthe rate of motion in the upper and lower part of the glacier, as\r\nwell as in different seasons of the year, was ascertained; the\r\namount of the annual melting was computed, and all the phenomena\r\nconnected with it studied. All the surrounding peaks,--the\r\nJungfrau, the Schreckhorn, the Finsteraarhorn, most of them until\r\nthen reputed unscalable,--were ascended, and the limit of glacial\r\naction discovered; in short all the physical laws of the glacier\r\nwere brought to light.\"\r\n\r\nWe now return to the personal narrative. After a number of days\r\nspent in the study of the local phenomena, the band of workers\r\nturned their attention to the second part of their programme,\r\nnamely, the ascent of the Strahleck, by crossing which and\r\ndescending on the other side, they intended to reach Grindelwald.\r\nOne morning, then, toward the end of August, their guides,\r\naccording to agreement, aroused them at three o'clock,--an hour\r\nearlier than their usual roll-call. The first glance outside spread\r\na general chill of disappointment over the party, for they found\r\nthemselves beleaguered by a wall of fog on every side. But\r\nLeuthold, as he lighted the fire and prepared breakfast, bade them\r\nnot despair,--the sun might make all right. In a few moments, one\r\nby one, the summits of the Schreckhorn, the Finsteraarhorn, the\r\nOberaarhorn, the Altmaner, the Scheuchzerhorn, lighted by the first\r\nrays of the sun, came out like islands above the ocean of mist,\r\nwhich softly broke away and vanished with the advancing light. In\r\nabout three hours they reached the base of the Strahleck. Their two\r\nguides, Leuthold and Wahren, had engaged three additional men for\r\nthis excursion, so that they now had five guides, none of whom were\r\nsuperfluous, since they carried with them various barometric\r\ninstruments which required careful handling. They began the ascent\r\nin single file, but the slopes soon became so steep and the light\r\nsnow (in which they floundered to the knees at every step) so deep,\r\nthat the guides resorted to the usual method in such cases of tying\r\nthem all together. The two head guides alone, Leuthold and Wahren,\r\nremained detached, clearing the snow in front of them, cutting\r\nsteps in the ice, and giving warning, by cry and gesture, of any\r\nhidden danger in the path. At nine o'clock, after an hour's\r\nclimbing, they stepped upon the small plateau, evenly covered with\r\nunbroken snow, formed by the summit of the Strahleck.\r\n\r\nThe day had proved magnificent. With a clear sky above them, they\r\nlooked down upon the valley of Grindelwald at their feet, while\r\naround and below them gathered the Scheideck and the Faulhorn, the\r\npyramidal outline of the Niesen, and the chain of the Stockhorn. In\r\nfront lay the great masses of the Eiger and the Monch, while to the\r\nsouthwest the Jungfrau rose above the long chain of the\r\nViescherhorner. The first pause of silent wonder and delight, while\r\nthey released themselves from their cords and arranged their\r\ninstruments, seems to have been succeeded by an outburst of\r\nspirits; for in the journal of the youngest of the party, Francois\r\nde Pourtales, then a lad of seventeen, we read: \"The guides began\r\nto wrestle and we to dance, when suddenly we saw a female chamois,\r\nfollowed by her young, ascending a neighboring slope, and presently\r\nfour or five more stretched their necks over a rock, as if to see\r\nwhat was going on. Breathless the wrestlers and the dancers paused,\r\nfearing to disturb by the slightest movement creatures so shy of\r\nhuman approach. They drew nearer until within easy gunshot\r\ndistance, and then galloping along the opposite ridge disappeared\r\nover the summit.\"\r\n\r\nThe party passed more than an hour on the top of the Strahleck,\r\nmaking observations and taking measurements. Then having rested and\r\nbroken their fast with such provisions as they had brought, they\r\nprepared for a descent, which proved the more rapid, since much of\r\nit was a long slide. Tied together once more, they slid, wherever\r\nthey found it possible to exchange the painful and difficult\r\nwalking for this simpler process. \"Once below these slopes of\r\nsnow,\" says the journal of young de Pourtales again, \"rocks almost\r\nvertical, or narrow ledges covered with grass, served us as a road\r\nand brought us to the glacier of the Grindelwald. To reach the\r\nglacier itself we traversed a crevasse of great depth, and some\r\ntwenty feet wide; on a bridge of ice, one or two feet in width, and\r\nbroken toward the end, where we were obliged to spring across. Once\r\non the glacier the rest was nothing. The race was to the fastest,\r\nand we were soon on the path of the tourists.\" Reaching the village\r\nof Grindelwald at three o'clock in the afternoon, they found it\r\ndifficult to persuade the people at the inn that they had left the\r\nglacier of the Aar that morning. From Grindelwald they returned by\r\nthe Scheideck to the Grimsel, visiting on their way the upper\r\nglacier of Grindelwald, the glacier of Schwartzwald, and that of\r\nRosenlaui, in order to see how far these had advanced since their\r\nlast visit to them. After a short rest at the Hospice of the\r\nGrimsel, Agassiz returned with two or three of his companions to\r\ntheir hut on the Aar glacier for the purpose of driving stakes into\r\nthe holes previously bored in the ice. He hoped by means of these\r\nstakes to learn the following year what had been the rate of\r\nmovement of the glacier. The summer's work closed with the ascent\r\nof the Siedelhorn. In all these ascents, the utmost pains was taken\r\nto ascertain how far the action of the ice might be traced upon\r\nthese mountain peaks and the limits determined at which the\r\npolished surfaces ceased, giving place to the rough, angular rock\r\nwhich had never been modeled by the ice.\r\n\r\nAgassiz had hardly returned from the Alps when he started for\r\nEngland. He had long believed that the Highlands of Scotland, the\r\nhilly Lake Country of England, and the mountains of Wales and\r\nIreland, would present the same phenomena as the valleys of the\r\nAlps. Dr. Buckland had offered to be his guide in this search after\r\nglacier tracks, as he had formerly been in the hunt after fossil\r\nfishes in Great Britain. When, therefore, the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association at Glasgow, at which they were both present,\r\nwas over, they started together for the Highlands. In a lecture\r\ndelivered by Agassiz, at his summer school at Penikese, a few\r\nmonths before his death, he recurred to this journey with the\r\nenthusiasm of a young man. Recalling the scientific isolation in\r\nwhich he then stood, opposed as he was to all the prominent\r\ngeologists of the day, he said: \"Among the older naturalists, only\r\none stood by me. Dr. Buckland, Dean of Westminster, who had come to\r\nSwitzerland at my urgent request for the express purpose of seeing\r\nmy evidence, and who had been fully convinced of the ancient\r\nextension of ice there, consented to accompany me on my glacier\r\nhunt in Great Britain. We went first to the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nand it is one of the delightful recollections of my life that as we\r\napproached the castle of the Duke of Argyll, standing in a valley\r\nnot unlike some of the Swiss valleys, I said to Buckland: 'Here we\r\nshall find our first traces of glaciers;' and, as the stage entered\r\nthe valley, we actually drove over an ancient terminal moraine,\r\nwhich spanned the opening of the valley.\" In short, Agassiz found,\r\nas he had anticipated, that in the mountains of Scotland, Wales,\r\nand the north of England, the valleys were in many instances\r\ntraversed by terminal moraines and bordered by lateral ones, as in\r\nSwitzerland. Nor were any of the accompanying phenomena wanting.\r\nThe characteristic traces left by the ice, as well known to him now\r\nas the track of the game to the hunter; the peculiar lines,\r\nfurrows, and grooves; the polished surfaces, the roches moutonnees;\r\nthe rocks, whether hard or soft, cut to one level, as by a rigid\r\ninstrument; the unstratified drift and the distribution of loose\r\nmaterial in relation to the ancient glacier beds,--all agreed with\r\nwhat he already knew of glacial action. He visited the famous\r\n\"roads of Glen Roy\" in the Grampian Hills, where so many geologists\r\nhad broken a lance in defense of their theories of subsidence and\r\nupheaval, of ancient ocean-levels and sea-beaches, formed at a time\r\nwhen they believed Glen Roy and the adjoining valleys to have been\r\nso many fiords and estuaries. To Agassiz, these parallel terraces\r\nexplained themselves as the shores of a glacial lake, held back in\r\nits bed for a time by neighboring glaciers descending from more\r\nsheltered valleys. The terraces marked the successively lower\r\nlevels at which the water stood, as these barriers yielded, and\r\nallowed its gradual escape.* (* For details, see a paper by Agassiz\r\non \"The Glacial Theory and its Recent Progress\" in the \"Edinburgh\r\nNew Philosophical Journal\" October 1842, accompanied by a map of\r\nthe Glen Roy region, and also an article entitled \"Parallel Roads\r\nof Glen Roy, in Scotland,\" in the second volume of Agassiz's\r\n\"Geological Sketches\".) The glacial action in the whole\r\nneighborhood was such as to leave no doubt in the mind of Agassiz\r\nthat Glen Roy and the adjoining glens, or valleys, had been the\r\ndrainage-bed for the many glaciers formerly occupying the western\r\nranges of the Grampian Hills. He returned from his tour satisfied\r\nthat the mountainous districts of Great Britain had all been\r\ncentres of glacial distribution, and that the drift material and\r\nthe erratic boulders, scattered over the whole country, were due to\r\nexactly the same causes as the like phenomena in Switzerland. On\r\nthe 4th of November, 1840, he read a paper before the Geological\r\nSociety of London, giving a summary of the scientific results of\r\ntheir excursion, followed by one from Dr. Buckland, who had become\r\nan ardent convert to his views. Apropos of this meeting, Dr.\r\nBuckland writes in advance as follows:--\r\n\r\nTAYMOUTH CASTLE, October 15, 1840.\r\n\r\n. . .Lyell has adopted your theory in toto!!! On my showing him a\r\nbeautiful cluster of moraines, within two miles of his father's\r\nhouse, he instantly accepted it, as solving a host of difficulties\r\nthat have all his life embarrassed him. And not these only, but\r\nsimilar moraines and detritus of moraines, that cover half of the\r\nadjoining counties are explicable on your theory, and he has\r\nconsented to my proposal that he should immediately lay them all\r\ndown on a map of the county and describe them in a paper to be read\r\nthe day after yours at the Geological Society. I propose to give in\r\nmy adhesion by reading, the same day with yours, as a sequel to\r\nyour paper, a list of localities where I have observed similar\r\nglacial detritus in Scotland, since I left you, and in various\r\nparts of England.\r\n\r\nThere are great reefs of gravel in the limestone valleys of the\r\ncentral bog district of Ireland. They have a distinct name, which I\r\nforget. No doubt they are moraines; if you have not, ere you get\r\nthis, seen one of them, pray do so.* (* Agassiz was then staying at\r\nFlorence Court, the seat of the Earl of Enniskillen, in County\r\nFermanagh, Ireland. While there he had an opportunity of studying\r\nmost interesting glacial phenomena. ) But it will not be worth\r\nwhile to go out of your way to see more than one; all the rest must\r\nfollow as a corollary. I trust you will not fail to be at Edinboro'\r\non the 20th, and at Sir W. Trevelyan's on the 24th. . .\r\n\r\nA letter of later date in the same month shows that Agassiz felt\r\nhis views to be slowly gaining ground among his English friends.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nLONDON, November 24, 1840.\r\n\r\n. . .Our meeting on Wednesday passed off very well; none of my\r\nfacts were disturbed, though Whewell and Murchison attempted an\r\nopposition; but as their objections were far-fetched, they did not\r\nproduce much effect. I was, however, delighted to have some\r\nappearance of serious opposition, because it gave me a chance to\r\ninsist upon the exactness of my observations, and upon the want of\r\nsolidity in the objections brought against them. Dr. Buckland was\r\ntruly eloquent. He has now full possession of this subject; is,\r\nindeed, completely master of it.\r\n\r\nI am happy to tell you that everything is definitely arranged with\r\nLord Francis,* (* Apropos of the sale of his original drawings of\r\nfossil fishes to Lord Francis Egerton.) and that I now feel within\r\nmyself a courage which doubles my strength. I have just written to\r\nthank him. To-morrow I shall devote to the fossils sent me by Lord\r\nEnniskillen, a list of which I will forward to you. . .\r\n\r\nWe append here, a little out of the regular course, a letter from\r\nHumboldt, which shows that he too was beginning to look more\r\nleniently upon Agassiz's glacial conclusions.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, August 15, 1840.\r\n\r\nI am the most guilty of mortals, my dear friend. There are not\r\nthree persons in the world whose remembrance and affection I value\r\nmore than yours, or for whom I have a warmer love and admiration,\r\nand yet I allow half the year to pass without giving you a sign of\r\nlife, without any expression of my warm gratitude for the\r\nmagnificent gifts I owe to you.* (* Probably the plates of the\r\n\"Fresh-Water Fishes\" and other illustrated publications.)\r\n\r\nI am a little like my republican friend who no longer answers any\r\nletters because he does not know where to begin. I receive on an\r\naverage fifteen hundred letters a year. I never dictate. I hold\r\nthat resort in horror. How dictate a letter to a scholar for whom\r\none has a real regard? I allow myself to be drawn into answering\r\nthe persons I know least, whose wrath is the most menacing. My\r\nnearer friends (and none are more dear to me than yourself) suffer\r\nfrom my silence. I count with reason upon their indulgence. The\r\ntone of your excellent letters shows that I am right. You spoil me.\r\nYour letters continue to be always warm and affectionate. I receive\r\nfew like them. Since two thirds of the letters addressed to me\r\n(partly copies of letters written to the king or the ministers)\r\nremain unanswered, I am blamed, charged with being a parvenu\r\ncourtier, an apostate from science. This bitterness of individual\r\nclaims does not diminish my ardent desire to be useful. I act\r\noftener than I answer. I know that I like to do good, and this\r\nconsciousness gives me tranquillity in spite of my over burdened\r\nlife. You are happy, my dear Agassiz, in the more simple and yet\r\ntruly proud position which you have created for yourself. You ought\r\nto take satisfaction in it as the father of a family, as an\r\nillustrious savant, as the originator and source of so many new\r\nideas, of so many great and noble conceptions.\r\n\r\nYour admirable work on the fossil fishes draws to a close. The last\r\nnumber, so rich in discoveries, and the prospectus, explaining the\r\ntrue state of this vast publication, have soothed all irritation\r\nregarding it. It is because I am so attached to you that I rejoice\r\nin the calmer atmosphere you have thus established about you. The\r\napproaching completion of the fossil fishes delivers me also from\r\nthe fear that a too great ardor might cause you irreparable losses.\r\nYou have shown not only what a talent like yours can accomplish,\r\nbut also how a noble courage can triumph over seemingly\r\ninsurmountable obstacles.\r\n\r\nIn what words shall I tell you how greatly our admiration is\r\nincreased by this new work of yours on the Fresh-Water Fishes?\r\nNothing has appeared more admirable, more perfect in drawing and\r\ncolor. This chromatic lithography resembles nothing we have had\r\nthus far. What taste has directed the publication! Then the short\r\ndescriptions accompanying each plate add singularly to the charm\r\nand the enjoyment of this kind of study. Accept my warm thanks, my\r\ndear friend. I not only delivered your letter and the copy with it\r\nto the king, but I added a short note on the merit of such an\r\nundertaking. The counselor of the Royal Cabinet writes me\r\nofficially that the king has ordered the same number of copies of\r\nthe Fresh-Water Fishes as of the Fossil Fishes; that is to say, ten\r\ncopies. M. de Werther has already received the order. This is, to\r\nbe sure, but a slight help; still, it is all that I have been able\r\nto obtain, and these few copies, with the king's name as\r\nsubscriber, will always be useful to you.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this letter without asking your pardon for some\r\nexpressions, too sharp, perhaps, in my former letters, about your\r\nvast geological conceptions. The very exaggeration of my\r\nexpressions must have shown you how little weight I attached to my\r\nobjections. . .My desire is always to listen and to learn. Taught\r\nfrom my youth to believe that the organization of past times was\r\nsomewhat tropical in character, and startled therefore at these\r\nglacial interruptions, I cried \"Heresy!\" at first. But should we\r\nnot always listen to a friendly voice like yours? I am interested\r\nin whatever is printed on these topics; so, if you have published\r\nanything at all complete lately on the ensemble of your geological\r\nideas, have the great kindness to send it to me through a\r\nbook-seller. . .\r\n\r\nShall I tell you anything of my own poor and superannuated works?\r\nThe sixth volume is wanting to my \"Geography of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury\" (Examen Critique). It will appear this summer. I am also\r\nprinting the second volume of a new work to be entitled \"Central\r\nAsia.\" It is not a second edition of \"Asiatic Fragments,\" but a new\r\nand wholly different work. The thirty-five sheets of the last\r\nvolume are printed, but the two volumes will only be issued\r\ntogether. You can judge of the difficulty of printing at Paris and\r\ncorrecting proofs here,--at Poretz or at Toplitz. I am just now\r\nbeginning to print the first number of my physics of the world,\r\nunder the title of \"Cosmos:\" in German, \"Ideen zur erner physischen\r\nWeltbeschreibung.\" It is in no sense a reproduction of the lectures\r\nI gave here. The subject is the same, but the presentation does not\r\nat all recall the form of a popular course. As a book, it has a\r\nsomewhat graver and more elevated style. A \"spoken book\" is always\r\na poor book, just as lectures read are poor however well prepared.\r\nPublished courses of lectures are my detestation. Cotta is also\r\nprinting a volume of mine in German, \"Physikalische geographische\r\nErinnerungen.\" Many unpublished things concerning the volcanoes of\r\nthe Andes, about currents, etc. And all this at the age when one\r\nbegins to petrify! It is very rash! May this letter prove to you\r\nand to Madame Agassiz that I am petrifying only at the extremities,\r\n--the heart is still warm. Retain for me the affection which I hold\r\nso dear.\r\n\r\nA. DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, or, rather, in the early days of March,\r\n1841, Agassiz visited, in company with M. Desor, the glacier of the\r\nAar and that of Rosenlaui. He wished to examine the stakes planted\r\nthe summer before on the glacier of the Aar, and to compare the\r\nwinter and summer temperature within as well as without the mass of\r\nice. But his chief object was to ascertain whether water still\r\nflowed from beneath the glaciers during the frosts of winter. This\r\nfact would have a direct bearing upon the theory which referred the\r\nmelting and movement of the glaciers chiefly to their lower\r\nsurface, explaining them by the central heat of the earth as their\r\nmain cause. Satisfied as he was of the fallacy of this notion,\r\nAgassiz still wished to have the evidence of the glacier itself.\r\nThe journey was, of course, a difficult one at such a season, but\r\nthe weather was beautiful, and they accomplished it in safety,\r\nthough not without much suffering. They found no water except the\r\npure and limpid water from springs that never freeze. The glacier\r\nlay dead in the grasp of winter. The results of this journey,\r\ntables of temperature, etc., are recorded in the \"Systeme\r\nGlaciaire.\"\r\n\r\nIn E. Desor's \"Sejours dans les Glaciers\" is found an interesting\r\ndescription of the incidents of this excursion and the appearance\r\nof the glaciers in winter. In ascending the course of the Aar they\r\nfrequently crossed the shrunken river on natural snow bridges, and\r\napproaching the Handeck over fearfully steep slopes of snow they\r\nhad some difficulty in finding the thread of water which was all\r\nthat remained of the beautiful summer cascade. On the glacier of\r\nthe Aar they found the Hotel des Neuchatelois buried in snow, while\r\nthe whole surface of the glacier as well as the surrounding peaks,\r\nfrom base to summit, wore the same spotless mantle. The\r\nFinsteraarhorn alone stood out in bold relief, black against a\r\nwhite world, its abrupt slopes affording no foothold for the snow.\r\nThe scene was far more monotonous than in summer. Crevasses, with\r\ntheir blue depths of ice, were closed; the many-voiced streams were\r\nstill; the moraines and boulders were only here and there visible\r\nthrough the universal shroud. The sky was without a cloud, the air\r\ntransparent, but the glitter of the uniform white surface was\r\nexquisitely painful to the eyes and skin, and the travelers were\r\nobliged to wrap their heads in double veils. They found the glacier\r\nof Rosenlaui less enveloped in snow than that of the Aar; and\r\nthough the magnificent ice-cave, so well known to travelers for its\r\nazure tints, was inaccessible, they could look into the vault and\r\nsee that the habitual bed of the torrent was dry. The journey was\r\naccomplished in a week without any untoward accident.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1841 Agassiz made a longer Alpine sojourn than\r\never before. The special objects of the season's work were the\r\ninternal structure of these vast moving fields of ice, the\r\nessential conditions of their origin and continued existence, the\r\naction of water within them as influencing their movement, and\r\ntheir own agency in direct contact with the beds and walls of the\r\nvalleys they occupied. The fact of their former extension and their\r\npresent oscillations might be considered as established. It\r\nremained to explain these facts with reference to the conditions\r\nprevailing within the mass itself. In short, the investigation was\r\npassing from the domain of geology to that of physics. Agassiz, who\r\nwas as he often said of himself no physicist, was the more anxious\r\nto have the cooperation of the ablest men in that department, and\r\nto share with them such facilities for observation and such results\r\nas he had thus far accumulated. In addition to his usual\r\ncollaborators, M. Desor and M. Vogt, he had, therefore, invited as\r\nhis guest, during part of the season, the distinguished physicist,\r\nProfessor James D. Forbes, of Edinburgh, who brought with him his\r\nfriend, Mr. Heath, of Cambridge.* (* As the impressions of Mr.\r\nForbes were only made known in connection with his own later and\r\nindependent researches it is unnecessary to refer to them here.) M.\r\nEscher de la Linth took also an active part in the work of the\r\nlater summer. To his working corps Agassiz had added the foreman of\r\nM. Kahli, an engineer at Bienne, to whom he had confided his plans\r\nfor the summer, and who furnished him with a skilled workman to\r\ndirect the boring operations, assist in measurements, etc. The\r\nartist of this year was M. Jacques Burkhardt, a personal friend of\r\nAgassiz, and his fellow-student at Munich, where he had spent some\r\ntime at the school of art. As a draughtsman he was subsequently\r\nassociated with Agassiz in his work at various times, and when they\r\nboth settled in America Mr. Burkhardt became a permanent member of\r\nAgassiz's household, accompanied him on his journeys, and remained\r\nwith him in relations of uninterrupted and affectionate regard till\r\nhis own death in 1867. He was a loyal friend and a warm-hearted\r\nman, with a thread of humor running through his dry good sense,\r\nwhich made him a very amusing and attractive companion.\r\n\r\nAs it was necessary, in view of his special programme of work, to\r\npenetrate below the surface of the glacier, and reach, if possible,\r\nits point of contact with the valley bottom, Agassiz had caused a\r\nlarger boring apparatus than had been used before, to be\r\ntransported to the old site on the Aar glacier. The results of\r\nthese experiments are incorporated in the \"Systeme Glaciaire,\"\r\npublished in 1846, with twenty-four folio plates and two maps. They\r\nwere of the highest interest with reference to the internal\r\nstructure and temperature of the ice and the penetrability of its\r\nmass, pervious throughout, as it proved, to air and water. On one\r\noccasion the boring-rod, having been driven to a depth of one\r\nhundred and ten feet, dropped suddenly two feet lower, showing that\r\nit had passed through an open space hidden in the depth of the ice.\r\nThe release of air-bubbles at the same time gave evidence that this\r\nglacial cave, so suddenly broken in upon, was not hermetically\r\nsealed to atmospheric influences from without.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was not satisfied with the report of his instruments from\r\nthese unknown regions. He determined to be lowered into one of the\r\nso-called wells in the glacier, and thus to visit its interior in\r\nperson. For this purpose he was obliged to turn aside the stream\r\nwhich flowed into the well into a new bed which he caused to be dug\r\nfor it. This done, he had a strong tripod erected over the opening,\r\nand, seated upon a board firmly attached by ropes, he was then let\r\ndown into the well, his friend Escher lying flat on the edge of the\r\nprecipice, to direct the descent and listen for any warning cry.\r\nAgassiz especially desired to ascertain how far the laminated or\r\nribboned structure of the ice (the so-called blue bands) penetrated\r\nthe mass of the glacier. This feature of the glacier had been\r\nobserved and described by M. Guyot (see page 292), but Mr. Forbes\r\nhad called especial attention to it, as in his belief connected\r\nwith the internal conditions of the glacier. It was agreed, as\r\nAgassiz bade farewell to his friends on this curious voyage of\r\ndiscovery, that he should be allowed to descend until he called out\r\nthat they were to lift him. He was lowered successfully and without\r\naccident to a depth of eighty feet. There he encountered an\r\nunforeseen difficulty in a wall of ice which divided the well into\r\ntwo compartments. He tried first the larger one, but finding it\r\nsplit again into several narrow tunnels, he caused himself to be\r\nraised sufficiently to enter the smaller, and again proceeded on\r\nhis downward course without meeting any obstacle. Wholly engrossed\r\nin watching the blue bands, still visible in the glittering walls\r\nof ice, he was only aroused to the presence of approaching danger\r\nby the sudden plunge of his feet into water. His first shout of\r\ndistress was misunderstood, and his friends lowered him into the\r\nice-cold gulf instead of raising him. The second cry was effectual,\r\nand he was drawn up, though not without great difficulty, from a\r\ndepth of one hundred and twenty-five feet. The most serious peril\r\nof the ascent was caused by the huge stalactites of ice, between\r\nthe points of which he had to steer his way. Any one of them, if\r\ndetached by the friction of the rope, might have caused his death.\r\nHe afterward said: \"Had I known all its dangers, perhaps I should\r\nnot have started on such an adventure. Certainly, unless induced by\r\nsome powerful scientific motive, I should not advise any one to\r\nfollow my example.\" On this perilous journey he traced the\r\nlaminated structure to a depth of eighty feet, and even beyond,\r\nthough with less distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe summer closed with their famous ascent of the Jungfrau. The\r\nparty consisted of twelve persons Agassiz, Desor, Forbes, Heath,\r\nand two travelers who had begged to join them,--M. de Chatelier, of\r\nNantes, and M. de Pury, of Neuchatel, a former pupil of Agassiz.\r\nThe other six were guides; four beside their old and tried friends,\r\nJacob Leuthold and Johann Wahren. They left the hospice of the\r\nGrimsel on the 27th of August, at four o'clock in the morning.\r\nCrossing the Col of the Oberaar they descended to the snowy plateau\r\nwhich feeds the Viescher glacier. In this grand amphitheatre,\r\nwalled in by the peaks of the Viescherhorner, they rested for their\r\nmidday meal. In crossing these fields of snow, while walking with\r\nperfect security upon what seemed a solid mass, they observed\r\ncertain window-like openings in the snow. Stooping to examine one\r\nof them, they looked into an immense open space, filled with soft\r\nblue light. They were, in fact, walking on a hollow crust, and the\r\nsmall window was, as they afterward found, opposite a large\r\ncrevasse on the other side of this ice-cavern, through which the\r\nlight entered, flooding the whole vault and receiving from its icy\r\nwalls its exquisite reflected color.* (* The effect is admirably\r\ndescribed by M. Desor in his account of this excursion, \"Sejours\r\ndans les Glaciers\" page 367.)\r\n\r\nOnce across the fields of snow and neve, a fatiguing walk of five\r\nhours brought them to the chalets of Meril,* (* Sometimes Moril,\r\nbut I have retained the spelling of M. Desor.--E.C.A.) where they\r\nexpected to sleep. The night which should have prepared them for\r\nthe fatigue of the next day was, however, disturbed by an untoward\r\naccident. The ladder left by Jacob Leuthold when last here with\r\nHugi in 1832, nine years before, and upon which he depended, had\r\nbeen taken away by a peasant of Viesch. Two messengers were sent in\r\nthe course of the night to the village to demand its restoration.\r\nThe first returned unsuccessful; the second was the bearer of such\r\nthreats of summary punishment from the whole party that he carried\r\nhis point, and appeared at last with the recovered treasure on his\r\nback. They had, in the mean while, lost two hours. They should have\r\nbeen on their road at three o'clock; it was now five. Jacob warned\r\nthem therefore that they must make all speed, and that any one who\r\nfelt himself unequal to a forced march should stay behind. No one\r\nresponded to his suggestion, and they were presently on the road.\r\n\r\nPassing Lake Meril, with its miniature icebergs, they reached the\r\nglacier of the Aletsch and its snow-fields, where the real\r\ndifficulties and dangers of the ascent were to begin. In this great\r\nsemicircular space, inclosed by the Jungfrau, the Monch, and the\r\nlesser peaks of this mountain group, lies the Aletsch reservoir of\r\nsnow or neve. As this spot presented a natural pause between the\r\nlaborious ascent already accomplished and the immense declivities\r\nwhich lay before them yet to be climbed, they named it Le Repos,\r\nand halted there for a short rest. Here they left also every\r\nneedless incumbrance, taking only a little bread and wine, in case\r\nof exhaustion, some meteorological instruments, and the inevitable\r\nladder, axe, and ropes of the Alpine climber. On their left, to the\r\nwest of the amphitheatre, a vast passage opened between the\r\nJungfrau and the Kranzberg, and in this could be distinguished a\r\nseries of terraces, one above the other. The story is the usual\r\none, of more or less steep slopes, where they sank in the softer\r\nsnow or cut their steps in the icy surfaces; of open crevasses,\r\ncrossed by the ladder, or the more dangerous ones, masked by snow,\r\nover which they trod cautiously, tied together by the rope. But\r\nthere was nothing to appall the experienced mountaineer with firm\r\nfoot and a steady head, until they reached a height where the\r\nsummit of the Jungfrau detached itself in apparently inaccessible\r\nisolation from all beneath or around it. To all but the guides\r\ntheir farther advance seemed blocked by a chaos of precipices,\r\neither of snow and ice or of rock. Leuthold remained however\r\nquietly confident, telling them he clearly saw the course he meant\r\nto follow. It began by an open gulf of unknown depth, though not\r\ntoo wide to be spanned by their ladder twenty-three feet in length.\r\nOn the other side of this crevasse, and immediately above it, rose\r\nan abrupt wall of icy snow. Up this wall Leuthold and another guide\r\nled the way, cutting steps as they went. When half way up they\r\nlowered the rope, holding one end, while their companions fastened\r\nthe other to the ladder, so that it served them as a kind of\r\nhand-rail, by which to follow. At the top they found themselves on\r\na terrace, beyond which a far more moderate slope led to the Col of\r\nRoththal, overlooking the Aletsch valley on one side, the Roththal\r\non the other. From this point the ascent was more and more steep\r\nand very slow, as every step had to be cut. Their difficulties were\r\nincreased, also, by a mist which gathered around them, and by the\r\nintense cold. Leuthold kept the party near the border of the ridge,\r\nbecause there the ice yielded more readily to the stroke of the\r\naxe; but it put their steadiness of nerve to the greatest test, by\r\nkeeping the precipice constantly in view, except when hidden by the\r\nfog. Indeed, they could drive their alpenstocks through the\r\noverhanging rim of frozen snow, and look sheer down through the\r\nhole thus made to the amphitheatre below. One of the guides left\r\nthem, unable longer to endure the sight of these precipices so\r\nclose at hand. As they neared their goal they feared lest the mist\r\nmight, at the last, deprive them of the culminating moment for\r\nwhich they had braved such dangers. But suddenly, as if touched by\r\ntheir perseverance, says M. Desor, the veil of fog lifted, and the\r\nsummit of the Jungfrau, in its final solitude, rose before them.\r\nThere was still a certain distance to be passed before they\r\nactually reached the base of the extreme peak. Here they paused,\r\nnot without a certain hesitation, for though the summit lay but a\r\nfew feet above them, they were separated from it by a sharp and\r\nseemingly inaccessible ridge. Even Agassiz, who was not easily\r\ndiscouraged, said, as he looked up at this highest point of the\r\nfortress they had scaled \"We can never reach it.\" For all answer,\r\nJacob Leuthold, their intrepid guide, flinging down everything\r\nwhich could embarrass his movements, stretched his alpenstock over\r\nthe ridge as a grappling pole, and, trampling the snow as he went,\r\nso as to flatten his giddy path for those who were to follow, was\r\nin a moment on the top. To so steep an apex does this famous peak\r\nnarrow, that but one person can stand on the summit at a time, nor\r\nwas even this possible till the snow was beaten down. Returning on\r\nhis steps, Leuthold, whose quiet, unflinching audacity of success\r\nwas contagious, assisted each one to stand for a few moments where\r\nhe had stood. The fog, the effect of which they had so much feared,\r\nnow lent something to the beauty of the view from this sublime\r\nfoothold. Masses of vapor rolled up from the Roththal on the\r\nsouthwest, but, instead of advancing to envelop them, paused at a\r\nlittle distance arrested by some current from the plain. The\r\ntemperature being below freezing point, the drops of moisture in\r\nthis wall of vapor were congealed into ice-crystals, which\r\nglittered like gold in the sunlight and gave back all the colors of\r\nthe rainbow.\r\n\r\nWhen all the party were once more assembled at the base of the\r\npeak, Jacob, whose resources never failed, served to each one a\r\nlittle wine, and they rested on the snow before beginning their\r\nperilous descent. Of living things they saw only a hawk, poised in\r\nthe air above their heads; of plants, a few lichens, where the\r\nsurface of the rock was exposed. It was four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon before they started on their downward path, turning their\r\nfaces to the icy slope, and feeling for the steps behind them, some\r\nseven hundred in all, which had been cut in ascending. In about an\r\nhour they reached the Col of the Roththal, where the greatest\r\ndifficulties of the ascent had begun and the greatest dangers of\r\nthe descent were over. So elated were they by the success of the\r\nday, and so regardless of lesser perils after those they had passed\r\nthrough, that they were now inclined to hurry forward incautiously.\r\nJacob, prudent when others were rash, as he was bold when others\r\nwere intimidated, constantly called them to order with his:\r\n\"Hubschle! nur immer hubschle!\" (\"Gently! always gently!\")\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock they were once more at Le Repos, having retraced\r\ntheir steps in two hours over a distance which had cost them six in\r\ngoing. Evening was now falling, but daylight was replaced by\r\nmoonlight, and when they reached the glacier its whole surface\r\nshone with a soft silvery lustre, broken here and there by the\r\ngigantic shadow of some neighboring mountain thrown black across\r\nit. At about nine o'clock, just as they had passed that part of the\r\nglacier which was, on account of the frequent crevasses, the most\r\ndangerous, they were cheered by the sound of a distant yodel. It\r\nwas the call of a peasant who had been charged to meet them with\r\nprovisions, at a certain distance above Lake Meril, in case they\r\nshould be overcome by hunger and fatigue. The most acceptable thing\r\nhe brought was his great wooden bucket, filled with fresh milk. The\r\npicture of the party, as they stood around him in the moonlight,\r\ndipping eagerly into his bucket, and drinking in turn until they\r\nhad exhausted the supply, is so vivid, that one shares their good\r\nspirits and their enjoyment. Thus refreshed, they started on the\r\nlast stage of their journey, three leagues of which yet lay before\r\nthem, and at half-past eleven arrived at the chalets of Meril,\r\nwhich they had left at dawn.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the party broke up, and Agassiz and Desor,\r\naccompanied by their friend, M. Escher de la Linth, returned to the\r\nGrimsel, and after a day's rest there repaired once more to the\r\nHotel des Neuchatelois. They remained on the glacier until the 5th\r\nof September, spending these few last days in completing their\r\nmeasurements, and in planting the lines of stakes across the\r\nglacier, to serve as a means of determining its rate of movement\r\nduring the year, and the comparative rapidity of that movement at\r\ncertain fixed points. Thus concluded one of the most eventful\r\nseasons Agassiz and his companions had yet passed upon the Alps.*\r\n(* Though quoting his exact language only in certain instances, the\r\naccount of this and other Alpine ascensions described above has\r\nbeen based upon M. E. Desor's \"Sejours dans les Glaciers\". His very\r\nspirited narratives, added to my own recollections of what I had\r\nheard from Mr. Agassiz himself on the same subject, have given me\r\nmy material.--E.C.A.)\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n1842-1843: AGE 35-36.\r\n\r\nZoological Work uninterrupted by Glacial Researches.\r\nVarious Publications.\r\n\"Nomenclator Zoologicus.\"\r\n\"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae.\"\r\nCorrespondence with English Naturalists.\r\nCorrespondence with Humboldt.\r\nGlacial Campaign of 1842.\r\nCorrespondence with Prince de Canino concerning Journey to United States.\r\nFossil Fishes from the Old Red Sandstone.\r\nGlacial Campaign of 1843.\r\nDeath of Leuthold, the Guide.\r\n\r\nAlthough his glacier work was now so prominent a feature of\r\nAgassiz's scientific life, his zoological studies, especially his\r\nichthyological researches, and more especially his work on fossil\r\nfishes, went on with little interruption. His publications upon\r\nFossil Mollusks,* (* \"Etudes Critiques sur les Mollusques Fossiles\"\r\n4 numbers quarto with 100 plates.) upon Tertiary Shells,* (*\r\n\"Iconographie des Coquilles Tertiaires reputees identiques sur les\r\nvivans\" 1 number quarto 14 plates.) upon Living and Fossil\r\nEchinoderms,* (* \"Monographie d'Echinodermes vivans et fossiles\" 4\r\nnumbers quarto with 37 plates.) with many smaller monographs on\r\nspecial subjects, were undertaken and completed during the most\r\nactive period of his glacial investigations. More surprising is it\r\nto find him, while pursuing new lines of investigation with\r\npassionate enthusiasm, engaged at the same time upon works\r\nseemingly so dry and tedious as his \"Nomenclator Zoologicus,\" and\r\nhis \"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae.\"\r\n\r\nThe former work, a large quarto volume with an Index,* (* The Index\r\nwas also published separately as an octavo.) comprised an\r\nenumeration of all the genera of the animal kingdom, with the\r\netymology of their names, the names of those who had first proposed\r\nthem, and the date of their publication. He obtained the\r\ncooperation of other naturalists, submitting each class as far as\r\npossible for revision to the leaders in their respective\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nIn his letter of presentation to the library of the Neuchatel\r\nAcademy, addressed to M. le Baron de Chambrier, President of the\r\nAcademic Council, Agassiz thus describes the Nomenclator.\r\n\r\n. . .\"Have the kindness to accept for the library of the Academy\r\nthe fifth number of a work upon the sources of zoological\r\ncriticism, the publication of which I have just begun. It is a work\r\nof patience, demanding long and laborious researches. I had\r\nconceived the plan in the first years of my studies, and since then\r\nhave never lost sight of it. I venture to believe it will be a\r\nbarrier against the Babel of confusion which tends to overwhelm the\r\ndomain of zoological synonymy. My book will be called 'Nomenclator\r\nZoologicus.'\". . .\r\n\r\nThe Bibliographia (4 volumes, octavo) was in some measure a\r\ncomplement of the Nomenclator, and contained a list of all the\r\nauthors named in the latter, with notices of their works. It\r\nappeared somewhat later, and was published by the Ray Society in\r\nEngland, in 1848, after Agassiz had left Europe for the United\r\nStates. The material for this work also had been growing upon his\r\nhands for years. Feeling more and more the importance of such a\r\nregister as a guide for students, he appealed to naturalists in all\r\nparts of Europe for information upon the scientific bibliography of\r\ntheir respective countries, and at last succeeded in cataloguing,\r\nwith such completeness as was possible, all known works and all\r\nscattered memoirs on zoology and geology. Unable to publish this\r\ncostly but unremunerative material, he was delighted to give it up\r\nto the Ray Society. The first three volumes were edited with\r\ncorrections and additions by Mr. H.E. Strickland, who died before\r\nthe appearance of the fourth volume, which was finally completed\r\nunder the care of his father-in-law, Sir William Jardine.\r\n\r\nThe ability, so eminently possessed by Agassiz of dealing with a\r\nnumber of subjects at once, was due to no superficial versatility.\r\nTo him his work had but one meaning. It was never disconnected in\r\nhis thought, and therefore he turned from his glaciers to his\r\nfossils, and from the fossil to the living world, with the feeling\r\nthat he was always dealing with kindred problems, bound together by\r\nthe same laws. Nowhere is this better seen than in the records of\r\nthe scientific society of Neuchatel, the society he helped to found\r\nin the first months of his professorship, and to which he always\r\nremained strongly attached, being a constant attendant at its\r\nsessions from 1833 to 1846. Here we find him from month to month,\r\nwith philosophic breadth of thought, treating of animals in their\r\nwidest relations, or describing minute structural details with the\r\nskill of a specialist. He presents organized beings in their\r\ngeological succession, in their geographical distribution, in their\r\nembryonic development. He reviews and remodels laws of\r\nclassification. Sometimes he illustrates the fossil by the living\r\nworld, sometimes he finds the key to present phenomena in the\r\nremote past. He reconstructs the history of the glacial period, and\r\npoints to its final chapter in the nearest Alpine valleys,\r\nconnecting these facts again with like phenomena in distant parts\r\nof the globe. But however wide his range and however various his\r\ntopics, under his touch they are all akin, all coordinate parts of\r\na whole which he strives to understand in its entirety. A few\r\nextracts from his correspondence will show him in his different\r\nlines of research at this time.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is from Edward Forbes, one of the earliest\r\nexplorers of the deep-sea fauna. Agassiz had asked him for some\r\nhelp in his work upon echinoderms.\r\n\r\nEDWARD FORBES TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n21 LOTHIAN ST., EDINBURGH, February 13, 1841.\r\n\r\n. . .A letter from you was to me one of the greatest of pleasures,\r\nand with great delight (though, I fear, imperfectly) I have\r\nexecuted the commission you gave me. It should have been done much\r\nsooner had not the storms been so bad in the sea near this that,\r\nuntil three days ago, I was not able to procure a living sea-urchin\r\nfrom which to make the drawings required. . .You have made all the\r\ngeologists glacier-mad here, and they are turning Great Britain\r\ninto an ice-house. Some amusing and very absurd attempts at\r\nopposition to your views have been made by one or two\r\npseudo-geologists; among others, poor--, who has read a paper at\r\nthe Royal Society here, maintaining that all the appearances you\r\nrefer to glaciers were caused by blocks of ice which floated this\r\nway in the Deluge! and that the fossils of the pleistocene strata\r\nwere mollusks, etc., which, climbing upon the ice-blocks, were\r\ncarried to warmer seas against their will!! To my mind, one of the\r\nbest proofs of the truth of your views lies in the decidedly arctic\r\ncharacter of the pleistocene fauna, which must be referred to the\r\nglacier time, and by such reference is easily understood. I mean\r\nduring the summer to collect data on that point, in order to\r\npresent a mass of geological proofs of your theory.\r\n\r\nDr. Traill tells me you are proposing to visit England again during\r\nthe coming summer. If you do, I hope we shall meet, when I shall\r\nhave many things to show you, which time did not permit when you\r\nwere here. I look anxiously for the forth-coming number of your\r\nhistory of the Echinodermata. . .\r\n\r\nFROM SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.\r\n\r\nJune 13, 1842.\r\n\r\n. . .Your letters have given me great pleasure: first, in assuring\r\nme that your zeal in ichthyology is undiminished, and that you are\r\nabout to give such striking proofs of it to the British\r\nAssociation; and next that you still pursue with enthusiasm your\r\nadmirable researches upon the glaciers. I should be charmed to put\r\nmyself under your guidance for a walk on the glaciers of the Aar,\r\nbut I hardly dare promise it yet. . .Even were I to make every\r\nhaste, I doubt if it be possible to reach your Swiss meeting in\r\ntime. It is just possible that I may find you in your glacial\r\ncantonment after your return, but even this will depend upon\r\ncircumstances over which I have no control.\r\n\r\nI send this letter to you by my friend, Admiral Sir Charles\r\nMalcolm, who passes through Neuchatel on his way to Geneva.\r\nAccompanying it is a copy of my last discourse, which I request you\r\nto accept and to read all parts of it. You will see that I have\r\ngrappled honestly and according to my own faith with your ice, but\r\nhave never lost sight of your great merit. My concluding paragraph\r\nwill convince you and all your friends that if I am wrong it is not\r\nfrom any preconceived notions, but only because I judge from what\r\nyou will call incomplete evidence. Your \"Venez voir!\" still sounds\r\nin my ears. . .\r\n\r\nMurchison remained for many years an opponent of the glacial theory\r\nin its larger application. In the discourse to which the above\r\nletter makes allusion (Address at the Anniversary Meeting of the\r\nGeological Society of London, 1842.* (* Extract from Report in\r\nvolume 33 of the \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\".)) is this\r\npassage: \"Once grant to Agassiz that his deepest valleys of\r\nSwitzerland, such as the enormous Lake of Geneva, were formerly\r\nfilled with snow and ice, and I see no stopping place. From that\r\nhypothesis you may proceed to fill the Baltic and the northern\r\nseas, cover southern England and half of Germany and Russia with\r\nsimilar icy sheets, on the surfaces of which all the northern\r\nboulders might have been shot off. So long as the greater number of\r\nthe practical geologists of Europe are opposed to the wide\r\nextension of a terrestrial glacial theory, there can be little risk\r\nthat such a doctrine should take too deep a hold of the mind. . .\r\nThe existence of glaciers in Scotland and England (I mean in the\r\nAlpine sense) is not, at all events, established to the\r\nsatisfaction of what I believe to be by far the greater number of\r\nBritish geologists.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, with rare candor, Murchison wrote to Agassiz as\r\nfollows; by its connection, though not by its date, the extract is\r\nin place here: \"I send you my last anniversary address, which I\r\nwrote entirely myself; and I beg you to believe that in the part of\r\nit that refers to the glacial period, and to Europe as it was\r\ngeographically, I have had the sincerest pleasure in avowing that I\r\nwas wrong in opposing as I did your grand and original idea of my\r\nnative mountains. Yes! I am now convinced that glaciers did descend\r\nfrom the mountains to the plains as they do now in Greenland.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1842, at about the same date with Murchison's\r\nletter disclaiming the glacial theory, Agassiz received, on the\r\nother hand, a new evidence, and one which must have given him\r\nespecial pleasure, of the favorable impression his views were\r\nmaking in some quarters in England.\r\n\r\nFROM DR. BUCKLAND.\r\n\r\nOXFORD, July 22, 1842.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am sure, rejoice with me at the adhesion of C. Darwin\r\nto the doctrine of ancient glaciers in North Wales, of which I send\r\nyou a copy, and which was communicated to me by Dr. Tritten, during\r\nthe late meeting at Manchester, in time to be quoted by me versus\r\nMurchison, when he was proclaiming the exclusive agency of floating\r\nicebergs in drifting erratic blocks and making scratched and\r\npolished surfaces. It has raised the glacial theory fifty per cent,\r\nas far as relates to glaciers descending inclined valleys; but\r\nHopkins and the Cantabrigians are still as obstinate as ever\r\nagainst allowing the power of expansion to move ice along great\r\ndistances on horizontal surfaces. . .\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter referred to above.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO DR. TRITTEN.\r\n\r\nYesterday (and the previous days) I had some most interesting work\r\nin examining the marks left by EXTINCT glaciers. I assure you, an\r\nextinct volcano could hardly leave more evident traces of its\r\nactivity and vast powers. I found one with the lateral moraine\r\nquite perfect, which Dr. Buckland did not see. Pray if you have any\r\ncommunication with Dr. Buckland give him my warmest thanks for\r\nhaving guided me, through the published abstract of his memoir, to\r\nscenes, and made me understand them, which have given me more\r\ndelight than I almost remember to have experienced since I first\r\nsaw an extinct crater. The valley about here and the site of the\r\ninn at which I am now writing must once have been covered by at\r\nleast 800 or 1,000 feet in thickness of solid ice! Eleven years ago\r\nI spent a whole day in the valley where yesterday everything but\r\nthe ice of the glaciers was palpably clear to me, and I then saw\r\nnothing but plain water and bare rock. These glaciers have been\r\ngrand agencies. I am the more pleased with what I have seen in\r\nNorth Wales, as it convinces me that my view of the distribution of\r\nthe boulders on the South American plains, as effected by floating\r\nice, is correct. I am also more convinced that the valleys of Glen\r\nRoy and the neighboring parts of Scotland have been occupied by\r\narms of the sea, and very likely (for in that point I cannot, of\r\ncourse, doubt Agassiz and Buckland) by glaciers also.\r\n\r\nIt continued to be a grief to Agassiz that Humboldt, the oldest of\r\nall his scientific friends, and the one whose opinion he most\r\nreverenced, still remained incredulous. Humboldt's letters show\r\nthat Agassiz did not willingly renounce the hope of making him a\r\nconvert. Agassiz's own letters to Humboldt are missing from this\r\ntime onward. Overwhelmed with occupation, and more at his ease in\r\nhis relations with the older scientific men, he had ceased to make\r\nthe rough drafts in which his earlier correspondence is recorded.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, March 2, 1842.\r\n\r\n. . .When one has been so long separated, even accidentally, from a\r\nfriend as I have been from you, my dear Agassiz, it is difficult to\r\nfind beginning or end to a letter. The kindly remembrance which you\r\nsend me is evidence that my long silence has not seemed strange to\r\nyou. . .It would be wasting words to tell you how I have been\r\nprevented, by the distractions of my life, always increasing with\r\nold age, from acknowledging the admirable things received from you,\r\n--upon living and fossil fishes, echinoderms, and glaciers. My\r\nadmiration of your boundless activity, of your beautiful\r\nintellectual life, increases with every year. This admiration for\r\nyour work and your bold excursions is based upon the most careful\r\nreading of all the views and investigations, for which I have to\r\nthank you. This very week I have read with great satisfaction your\r\ntruly philosophical address, and your long treatise in Cotta's\r\nfourth \"Jahresschrift.\" Even L. von Buch confessed that the first\r\nhalf of your treatise, the living presentation of the succession of\r\norganized beings, was full of truth, sagacity, and novelty.\r\n\r\nI in no way reproach you, my dear friend, for the urgent desire\r\nexpressed in all your letters, that your oldest friends should\r\naccept your comprehensive geological view of your ice-period. It is\r\nvery noble and natural to wish that what has impressed us as true\r\nshould also be recognized by those we love. . .I believe I have\r\nread and compared all that has been written for and against the\r\nice-period, and also upon the transportation of boulders, whether\r\npushed along or carried by floods or gliding over slopes. My own\r\nopinion, as you know, can have no weight or authority, since I have\r\nnot myself seen the most decisive points. Indeed I am, perhaps\r\nwrongly, inclined to look upon all geological theories as having\r\ntheir being in a mythical region, in which, with the progress of\r\nphysics, the phantasms are modified century by century. But the\r\n\"elephants caught in the ice,\" and Cuvier's \"instantaneous change\r\nof climate,\" seem to me no more intelligible today than when I\r\nwrote my Asiatic fragments. According to all that we know of the\r\ndecrease of heat in the earth, I cannot understand such a change of\r\ntemperature in a space of time which does not also allow for the\r\ndecaying of flesh. I understand much better how wolves, hares, and\r\ndogs, should they fall to-day into clefts of the frozen regions of\r\nNorthern Siberia (and the so-called \"elephant-ice\" is in plain\r\nprose only porphyritic drift mixed with ice-crystals, true drift\r\nmaterial), might retain their flesh and muscles. . .But I am only a\r\ngrumbling rebellious subject in your kingdom. . .Do not be vexed\r\nwith a friend who is more than ever impressed with your services to\r\ngeology, your philosophical views of nature, your profound\r\nknowledge of organized beings. . .\r\n\r\nWith old attachment and the warmest friendship, your\r\n\r\nA. DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nIn the same strain is this extract from another letter of\r\nHumboldt's, written two or three months later.\r\n\r\n. . .\"'Grace from on high,' says Madame de Sevigne, 'comes slowly.'\r\nI especially desire it for the glacial period and for that fatal\r\ncap of ice which frightens me, child of the equator that I am. My\r\nheresy, of little importance, since I have seen nothing, does not,\r\nI assure you, my dear Agassiz, diminish my ardent desire that all\r\nyour observations should be published. . .I rejoice in the good\r\nnews you give me of the fishes. I should pain you did I add that\r\nthis work of yours, by the light it has shed on the organic\r\ndevelopment of animals, makes the true foundation of your glory.\".\r\n. .\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, June, 1842.\r\n\r\n. . .I am hard at work on the fishes of the \"Old Red,\" and will\r\nsend you at Manchester a part at least of the plates, with a\r\ngeneral summary of the species of that formation. I aim to finish\r\nthe work with such care that it shall mark a sensible advance in\r\nichthyology. I hope it will satisfy you. . .You ask me how I intend\r\nto finish my Fossil Fishes? As follows: As soon as the number on\r\nthe species of the \"Old Red\" is finished, I shall complete the\r\ngeneral outline of the work as I did with volume 4, in order that\r\nthe arrangement and character of all the families in the four\r\norders may be studied in their zoological affinities, with their\r\ngenera and principal species. But as this outline can no longer\r\ncontain the innumerable species now known to me, I take up\r\nmonographically the species from the different geological\r\nformations in the order of the deposits, and publish as many\r\nsupplements as there are great formations rich in fossil fishes. I\r\nshall limit myself to the species described in the body of the\r\nwork, merely adding the description of the new species in each\r\ndeposit, and such additions as I may have to make for those already\r\nknown. In this way, those who wish to study fossil fishes from the\r\nzoological stand-point can turn to the work in the original form,\r\nwhile those who wish to study them in their geological relations\r\ncan confine themselves to the supplements. By means of double\r\nregisters at the end of each volume, these two distinct parts of\r\nthe work will be again united as a complete whole. This is the only\r\nplan I have been able to devise by which I could publish in\r\nsuccession all my materials without burdening my first subscribers,\r\nwho will thus be free to accept the supplements or not, as they\r\nprefer. Should you have occasion to mention this arrangement to the\r\nfriends of fossil ichthyology, pray do so; it seems to me for the\r\ninterest of the matter that it should be known. . .I propose to\r\nresume with new zeal my researches upon the fossil fishes as soon\r\nas I return from an excursion I wish to make in July and August to\r\nthe glacier of the Aar, where I hope, by a last visit this year, to\r\nconclude my labors on this subject. You will be glad to learn that\r\nthe beautiful barometer you gave me has been my faithful companion\r\nin the Alps. . .I have the pleasure to tell you that the King of\r\nPrussia has made me a handsome gift of nearly 200 pounds for the\r\ncontinuance of my glacial work. I feel, therefore, the greater\r\ncertainty of completing what remains for me to do. . .\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1842 opened on the 4th of July. The boulder had\r\nceased to be a safe shelter, and was replaced by a rough frame\r\ncabin covered with canvas. If the party had some regrets in leaving\r\ntheir picturesque hut beneath the rock, the greater comfort of the\r\nnew abode consoled them. It had several divisions. A sleeping-place\r\nfor the guides and workmen was partitioned off from a middle room\r\noccupied by Agassiz and his friends, while the front space served\r\nas dining-room, sitting-room, and laboratory. This outer apartment\r\nboasted a table and one or two benches; even a couple of chairs\r\nwere kept as seats of honor for occasional guests. A shelf against\r\nthe wall and a few pegs accommodated books, instruments, coats,\r\netc., and a plank floor, on which to spread their blankets at\r\nnight, was a good exchange for the frozen surface of the glacier.*\r\n(* In bidding farewell to the boulder which had been the first\r\n\"Hotel des Neuchatelois\" we may add a word of its farther fortunes.\r\nIt had begun to split in 1841, and was completely rent asunder in\r\n1844, after which frost and rain completed its dismemberment.\r\nStrange to say, during the last summer (1884) certain fragments of\r\nthe mass have been found, inscribed with the names of some of the\r\nparty; one of the blocks bearing beside names, the mark \"Number 2\".\r\nThe account says \"The middle stone, the one numbered 2, was at the\r\nintersecting point of two lines drawn from the Pavilion Dollfuss to\r\nthe Scheuchzerhorn on the one part, and from the Rothhorn to the\r\nThierberg on the other.\" According to the measurements taken by\r\nAgassiz, the Hotel des Neuchatelois in 1840 stood at 797 metres\r\nfrom the promontory of Abschwung. We are thus enabled, by referring\r\nto the large glacier map of Wild and Stengel, to compare the\r\npresent with the then position of the stone, and thereby ascertain\r\nthe progress of the glacier since the time in question. Thus the\r\nboulder still contributes something toward the sequel of the work\r\nbegun by those who once found shelter beneath it.--E.C.A.)\r\n\r\nMr. Wild, an engineer of known ability, was now a member of their\r\nparty, as a topographical survey was to be one of the chief objects\r\nof the summer's work. The results of this survey, which was\r\ncontinued during two summers, are embodied in the map accompanying\r\nAgassiz's \"Systeme Glaciaire.\" Experiments upon the extent and\r\nconnection of the net-work of capillary fissures that admitted\r\nwater into the interior of the glaciers, occupied Agassiz's own\r\nattention during a great part of the summer. In order to ascertain\r\nthis, colored liquids were introduced into the glacier by means of\r\nboring, and it was found that they threaded their way through the\r\nmass of the ice and reappeared at lower points with astonishing\r\nrapidity. A gallery was cut at a depth of ten metres below the\r\nsurface, through a wall of ice intervening between two crevasses.\r\nThe colored liquid poured into a hole above soon appeared on the\r\nceiling of the gallery. The experimenters were surprised to find\r\nthat at night the same result was obtained, and that the liquid\r\npenetrated from the surface to the roof of the gallery even more\r\nquickly than during the day. This was explained by the fact that\r\nthe fissures were then free from any moisture arising from surface\r\nmelting, so that the passage through them was unimpeded.* (*\r\nDistrust has been thrown upon these results by the failure of more\r\nrecent attempts to repeat the same experiments. In reference to\r\nthis, Agassiz himself says \"The infiltration has been denied in\r\nconsequence of the failure of some experiments in which an attempt\r\nwas made to introduce colored fluids into the glacier. To this I\r\ncan only answer that I succeeded completely myself in the self-same\r\nexperiment which a later investigator found impracticable, and that\r\nI see no reason why the failure of the latter attempt should cast a\r\ndoubt upon the success of the former. The explanation of the\r\ndifference in the result may perhaps be found in the fact that as a\r\nsponge gorged with water can admit no more fluid than it already\r\ncontains, so the glacier, under certain circumstances, and\r\nespecially at noonday in summer, may be so soaked with water that\r\nall attempts to pour colored fluids into it would necessarily\r\nfail.\"--See \"Geological Sketches\" by L. Agassiz, page 236.)\r\n\r\nThe comparative rate of advance in the different parts of the\r\nglacier was ascertained this summer with greater precision than\r\nbefore. The rows of stakes planted in a straight line across the\r\nglacier by Agassiz and Escher de la Linth, in the previous\r\nSeptember, now described a crescent with the curve turned toward\r\nthe terminus of the glacier, showing, contrary to the expectation\r\nof Agassiz, that the centre moved faster than the sides. The\r\ncorrespondence of the curve in the stratification with that of the\r\nline of stakes confirmed this result. The study of the\r\nstratification of the snow was a marked feature of the season's\r\nwork, and Agassiz believed, as will be seen by a later letter, that\r\nhe had established this fact of glacial structure beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe origin and mode of formation of the crevasses also especially\r\noccupied the observers. On the 7th of August, Agassiz had an\r\nopportunity of watching this phenomenon in its initiation.\r\nAttracted to a certain spot on the glacier by a commotion among his\r\nworkmen, he found them alarmed at the singular noises and movements\r\nin the ice. \"I heard,\" he says, \"at a little distance a sound like\r\nthe simultaneous discharge of fire-arms; hurrying in the direction\r\nof the noise, it was repeated under my feet with a movement like\r\nthat of a slight earthquake; the ground seemed to shift and give\r\nway under me, but now the sound differed from the preceding, and\r\nresembled a crumbling of rocks, without, however, any perceptible\r\nsinking of the surface. The glacier actually trembled,\r\nnevertheless; for a block of granite three feet in diameter,\r\nperched on a pedestal two feet high, suddenly fell down. At the\r\nsame instant a crack opened between my feet and ran rapidly across\r\nthe glacier in a straight line.\"* (* Extract from a letter of Louis\r\nAgassiz to M. Arago dated from the Hotel des Neuchatelois, Glacier\r\nof the Aar, August 7, 1842.) On this occasion Agassiz saw three\r\ncrevasses formed in an hour and a half, and heard others opening at\r\na greater distance from him. He counted eight new fissures in a\r\nspace of one hundred and twenty-five feet. The phenomenon continued\r\nthroughout the evening, and recurred, though with less frequency,\r\nduring the night. The cracks were narrow, the largest an inch and a\r\nhalf in width, and their great depth was proved by the rapidity\r\nwith which they drained any standing water in their immediate\r\nvicinity. \"A boring-hole,\" says Agassiz, \"one hundred and thirty\r\nfeet deep and six inches in diameter, full of water, was completely\r\nemptied in a few minutes, showing that these narrow cracks\r\npenetrated to great depths.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer's work included observations also on the comparative\r\nmovement of the glacier during the day and night, on the surface\r\nwaste of the mass, its reparation, on the neve and snow of the\r\nupper regions, on the meridian holes, the sun-dials of the\r\nglaciers, as they have been called.* (* \"Here and there on the\r\nglacier there are patches of loose material, dust, sand, or gravel,\r\naccumulated by diminutive water-rills and small enough to become\r\nheated during the day. They will, of course, be warmed first on\r\ntheir eastern side, then still more powerfully on their southern\r\nside, and, in the afternoon, with less force again, on their\r\nwestern side, while the northern side will remain comparatively\r\ncool. Thus around more than half of their circumference they melt\r\nthe ice in a semicircle, and the glacier is covered with little\r\ncrescent-shaped troughs of this description, with a steep wall on\r\none side and a shallow one on the other, and a little heap of loose\r\nmaterials in the bottom. They are the sun-dials of the glacier,\r\nrecording the hour by the advance of the sun's rays upon them.\"--\"\r\nGeological Sketches\" by L. Agassiz page 293.) On the whole, the\r\nmost important result of the campaign was the topographical survey\r\nof the glacier, recorded in the map published in Agassiz's second\r\nwork on the glacier.\r\n\r\nAt about this time there begin to be occasional references in his\r\ncorrespondence to a journey of exploration in the United States.\r\nEspecially was this plan in frequent discussion between him and\r\nCharles Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, a naturalist almost as ardent\r\nas himself, with whom he had long been in intimate scientific\r\ncorrespondence. In April, 1842, the prince writes him: \"I indulge\r\nmyself in dreaming of the journey to America in which you have\r\npromised to accompany me. What a relaxation! and at the same time\r\nwhat an amount of useful work!\" Again, a few months later, \"You\r\nmust keep me well advised of your plans, and I, in my turn, will\r\ntry so to arrange my affairs as to find myself free in the spring\r\nof 1844 for a voyage, the chief object of which will be to show my\r\noldest son the country where he was born, and where man may develop\r\nfree of shackles. The mere anticipation of this journey is\r\ndelightful to me, since I shall have you at my side, and may thus\r\nfeel sure that it will make an epoch in science.\" This letter is\r\nanswered from the glacier; the first part refers to the\r\nNomenclator, in regard to which he often consulted the prince.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO THE PRINCE OF CANINO.\r\n\r\nGLACIER OF THE AAR, September 1, 1842.\r\n\r\n. . .I thank you most sincerely for the pains you have so kindly\r\ntaken with my proof, and for pointing out the faults and omissions\r\nyou have noticed in my register of birds. I made the corrections at\r\nonce, and have taken the liberty of mentioning on the cover of this\r\nnumber the share you have consented to take in my Nomenclator. I\r\nshall try to do better and better in the successive classes, but\r\nyou well know the impossibility of avoiding grave errors in such a\r\nwork, and that they can be wholly weeded out only in a second and\r\nthird edition. I should have written sooner in answer to your last,\r\nhad not your letter reached me on the Glacier of the Aar, where I\r\nhave been since the beginning of July, following up observations,\r\nthe results of which become every day more important and more\r\nconvincing. The most striking fact, one which I think I have placed\r\nbeyond the reach of doubt, is the primitive stratification of the\r\nneve, or fields of snow,--stratified from the higher regions across\r\nthe whole course of the glacier to its lower extremity. I have\r\nprepared a general map, with transverse sections, showing how the\r\nlayers lift themselves on the borders of the glacier and also at\r\ntheir junction, where two glaciers meet at the outlet of adjoining\r\nvalleys; and how, also, the waving lines formed by the layers on\r\nthe surface change to sharper concentric curves with a marked axis,\r\nas the glacier descends to lower levels. For a full demonstration\r\nof the matter, I ought to send you my map and plans, of which I\r\nhave, as yet, no duplicates; but the fact is incontestable, and you\r\nwill oblige me by announcing it in the geological section at Padua.\r\nM. Charpentier, who is going to your meeting, will contest it, but\r\nyou can tell him from me that it is as evident as the\r\nstratification of the Neptunic rocks. To see and understand it\r\nfully, however, one must stand well above the glacier, so as to\r\ncommand the surface as a whole in one view. I would add that I am\r\nnot now alluding to the blue and white bands in the ice of which I\r\nspoke to you last year; this is a quite distinct phenomenon.\r\n\r\nI wish I could accept your kind invitation, but until I have gone\r\nto the bottom of the glacier question and terminated my \"Fossil\r\nFishes,\" I do not venture to move. It is no light task to finish\r\nall this before our long journey, to which I look forward, as it\r\ndraws nearer, with a constantly increasing interest. I am very\r\nsorry not to join you at Florence. It would have been a great\r\npleasure for me to visit the collections of northern Italy in your\r\ncompany. . .I write you on a snowy day, which keeps me a prisoner\r\nin my tent; it is so cold that I can hardly hold my pen, and the\r\nwater froze at my bedside last night. The greatest privation is,\r\nhowever, the lack of fruit and vegetables. Hardly a potato once a\r\nfortnight, but always and every day, morning and night, mutton,\r\neverlasting mutton, and rice soup. As early as the end of July we\r\nwere caught for three days by the snow; I fear I shall be forced to\r\nbreak up our encampment next week without having finished my work.\r\nWhat a contrast between this life and that of the plain! I am\r\nafraid my letter may be long on the road before reaching the mail,\r\nand I pause here that I may not miss the chance of forwarding it by\r\na man who has just arrived with provisions and is about to return\r\nto the hospice of the Grimsel, where some trustworthy guide will\r\nundertake to deliver it at the first post-office.\r\n\r\nNo sooner is Agassiz returned from the glacier than we meet him\r\nagain in the domain of his fossil fishes.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, December 15, 1842.\r\n\r\n. . .In the last few months I have made an important step in the\r\nidentification of fossil fishes. The happy idea occurred to me of\r\napplying the microscope to the study of fragments of their bones,\r\nespecially those of the head, and I have found in their structure\r\nmodifications as remarkable and as numerous as those which Mr. Owen\r\ndiscovered in the structure of teeth. Here there is a vast new\r\nfield to explore. I have already applied it to the identification\r\nof the fossil fishes in the Old Red of Russia sent me for that\r\npurpose by Mr. Murchison. You will find more ample details about it\r\nin my report to him. I congratulate myself doubly on the results;\r\nfirst, because of their great importance in paleontology, and also\r\nbecause they will draw more closely my relations with Mr. Owen,\r\nwhom I always rejoice to meet on the same path with myself, and\r\nwhom I believe incapable of jealousy in such matters. . .The only\r\npoint indeed, on which I think I may have a little friendly\r\ndifference with him, is concerning the genus Labyrinthodon, which I\r\nam firmly resolved, on proofs that seem to me conclusive, to claim\r\nfor the class of fishes.* (* On seeing Owen's evidence some years\r\nlater, Agassiz at once acknowledged himself mistaken on this point.\r\n) As soon as I have time I will write to Mr. Owen, but this need\r\nnot prevent you from speaking to him on the subject if you have an\r\nearly opportunity to do so. I am now exclusively occupied with the\r\nfossil fishes, which at any cost I wish to finish this winter. . .\r\nBefore even returning to my glacier work, I will finish my\r\nmonograph of the Old Red, so that you may present it at the Cork\r\nmeeting, which it will be impossible for me to attend. . .I am\r\ninfinitely grateful to you and Lord Enniskillen for your\r\nwillingness to trust your Sheppy fishes to me; I shall thus be\r\nprepared in advance for a strict determination of these fossils.\r\nHaving them for some time before my eyes, I shall become familiar\r\nwith all the details. When I know them thoroughly, and have\r\ncompared them with the collections of skeletons in the Museums of\r\nParis, of Leyden, of Berlin, and of Halle, I will then come to\r\nEngland to see what there may be in other collections which I\r\ncannot have at my disposal here.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1843, apart from his duties as professor, was devoted\r\nto the completion of the various zoological works on which he was\r\nengaged, and to the revision of materials he had brought back from\r\nthe glacier. His habits with reference to physical exercise were\r\nvery irregular. He passed at once from the life of the mountaineer\r\nto that of the closet student. After weeks spent on the snow and\r\nice of the glacier, constantly on foot and in the open air, he\r\nwould shut himself up for a still longer time in his laboratory,\r\nmotionless for hours at his microscope by day, and writing far into\r\nthe night, rarely leaving his work till long after midnight. He was\r\nalso forced at this time to press forward his publications in the\r\nhope that he might have some return for the sums he had expended\r\nupon them. This was indeed a very anxious period of his life. He\r\ncould never be brought to believe that purely intellectual aims\r\nwere not also financially sound, and his lithographic\r\nestablishment, his glacier work, and his costly researches in\r\nzoology had proved far beyond his means. The prophecies of his old\r\nfriend Humboldt were coming true. He was entangled in obligations,\r\nand crushed under the weight of his own undertakings. He began to\r\ndoubt the possibility of carrying out his plan of a scientific\r\njourney to the United States.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO THE PRINCE OF CANINO.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, April, 1843.\r\n\r\n. . .I have worked like a slave all winter to finish my fossil\r\nfishes; you will presently receive my fifteenth and sixteenth\r\nnumbers, forwarded two days since, with more than forty pages of\r\ntext, containing many new observations. I shall allow myself no\r\ninterruption until this work is finished, hoping thereby to obtain\r\na little freedom, for if my position here is not changed I shall be\r\nforced to seek the means of existence elsewhere. Meantime,\r\nextravagant projects present themselves, as is apt to be the case\r\nwhen one is in difficulties. That of accompanying you to the United\r\nStates was so tempting, that I am bitterly disappointed to think\r\nthat its execution becomes impossible in my present circumstances.\r\nAll my projects for further publications must also be adjourned, or\r\nperhaps renounced. . .Possibly, when my work on the fossil fishes\r\nis completed, the sale of some additional copies may help me to\r\nrise again. And yet I have not much hope of this, since all the\r\nattempts of my friends to obtain subscriptions for me in France and\r\nRussia have failed: because the French government takes no interest\r\nin what is done out of Paris; and in Russia such researches, having\r\nlittle direct utility, are looked upon with indifference. Do you\r\nthink any position would be open to me in the United States, where\r\nI might earn enough to enable me to continue the publication of my\r\nunhappy books; which never pay their way because they do not meet\r\nthe wants of the world?. . .\r\n\r\nIn the following July we find him again upon the glacier. But the\r\ncampaign of 1843 opened sadly for the glacial party. Arriving at\r\nMeiringen they heard that Jacob Leuthold was ill and would probably\r\nbe unable to accompany them. They went to his house, and found him,\r\nindeed, the ghost of his former self, apparently in a rapid\r\ndecline. Nevertheless, he welcomed them gladly to his humble home,\r\nand would have kept them for some refreshment. Fearing to fatigue\r\nhim, however, they stayed but a few moments. As they left, one of\r\nthe party pointed to the mountains, adding a hope that he might\r\nsoon join them. His eyes filled with tears; it was his only answer,\r\nand he died three days later. He was but thirty-seven years of age,\r\nand at that time the most intrepid and the most intelligent of the\r\nOberland guides. His death was felt as a personal grief by the band\r\nof workers whose steps he had for years guided over the most\r\ndifficult Alpine passes.\r\n\r\nThe summer's work continued and completed that of the last season.\r\nOn leaving the glacier the year before they had marked a network of\r\nloose boulders, such as travel with the ice, and also a number of\r\nfixed points in the valley walls, comparing and registering their\r\ndistance from each other. They had also sunk a line of stakes\r\nacross the glacier. The change in the relative position of the two\r\nsets of signals and the curve in their line of stakes gave them,\r\nself-recorded, as it were, the rate of advance of the glacier as a\r\nwhole, and also the comparative rate of progression in its\r\ndifferent parts. Great pains was also taken during the summer to\r\nmeasure the advance in every twenty-four hours, as well as to\r\ncompare the diurnal with the nocturnal movement, and to ascertain\r\nthe amount of surface waste. The season was an unfavorable one,\r\nbeginning so late and continuing so cold that the period of work\r\nwas shortened.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\n1843-1846: AGE 36-39.\r\n\r\nCompletion of Fossil Fishes.\r\nFollowed by Fossil Fishes of the Old Red Sandstone.\r\nReview of the Later Work.\r\nIdentification of Fishes by the Skull.\r\nRenewed Correspondence with Prince Canino about Journey\r\n   to the United States.\r\nChange of Plan owing to the Interest of the King of Prussia\r\n   in the Expedition.\r\nCorrespondence between Professor Sedgwick and Agassiz on\r\n   Development Theory.\r\nFinal Scientific Work in Neuchatel and Paris.\r\nPublication of \"Systeme Glaciaire.\"\r\nShort Stay in England.\r\nFarewell Letter from Humboldt.\r\nSails for United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the \"Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles\" was completed,\r\nand fast upon its footsteps, in 1844, followed the author's\r\n\"Monograph on the Fossil Fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, or the\r\nDevonian System of Great Britain and Russia,\" a large quarto volume\r\nof text, accompanied by forty-one plates. Nothing in his\r\npaleontological studies ever interested Agassiz more than this\r\ncurious fauna of the Old Red, so strange in its combinations that\r\neven well-informed naturalists had attributed its fossil remains to\r\nvarious classes of the animal kingdom in turn, and, indeed, long\r\nremained in doubt as to their true nature. Agassiz says himself in\r\nhis Preface: \"I can never forget the impression produced upon me by\r\nthe sight of these creatures, furnished with appendages resembling\r\nwings, yet belonging, as I had satisfied myself, to the class of\r\nfishes. Here was a type entirely new to us, about to reenter (for\r\nthe first time since it had ceased to exist) the series of beings;\r\nnor could anything, thus far revealed from extinct creations, have\r\nled us to anticipate its existence. So true is it that observation\r\nalone is a safe guide to the laws of development of organized\r\nbeings, and that we must be on our guard against all those systems\r\nof transformation of species so lightly invented by the\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\nThe author goes on to state that the discovery of these fossils was\r\nmainly due to Hugh Miller, and that his own work had been confined\r\nto the identification of their character and the determination of\r\ntheir relations to the already known fossil fishes. This work, upon\r\na type so extraordinary, implied, however, innumerable and\r\nreiterated comparisons, and a minute study of the least fragments\r\nof the remains which could be procured. The materials were chiefly\r\nobtained in Scotland; but Sir Roderick Murchison also contributed\r\nhis own collection from the Old Red of Russia, and various other\r\nspecimens from the same locality. Not only on account of their\r\npeculiar structure were the fishes of the Old Red interesting to\r\nAgassiz, but also because, with this fauna, the vertebrate type\r\ntook its place for the first time in what were then supposed to be\r\nthe most ancient fossiliferous beds. When Agassiz first began his\r\nresearches on fossil fishes, no vertebrate form had been discovered\r\nbelow the coal. The occurrence of fishes in the Devonian and\r\nSilurian beds threw the vertebrate type back, as he believed, into\r\nline with all the invertebrate classes, and seemed to him to show\r\nthat the four great types of the animal kingdom, Radiates,\r\nMollusks, Articulates, and Vertebrates, had appeared together.* (*\r\nIntroduction to the \"Poissons Fossiles de Vieux Gres Rouge\" page\r\n22.) \"It is henceforth demonstrated,\" says Agassiz, \"that the\r\nfishes were included in the plan of the first organic combinations\r\nwhich made the point of departure for all the living inhabitants of\r\nour globe in the series of time.\"\r\n\r\nIn his opinion this simultaneity of appearance, as well as the\r\nrichness and variety displayed by invertebrate classes from the\r\nbeginning, made it* (* Introduction to the \"Poissons Fossiles du\r\nVieux Gres Rouge\" page 21.) \"impossible to refer the first\r\ninhabitants of the earth to a few stocks, subsequently\r\ndifferentiated under the influence of external conditions of\r\nexistence.\". . .He adds:* (* Introduction to the \"Poissons Fossiles\r\nde Vieux Gres Rouge\" page 24.) \"I have elsewhere presented my views\r\nupon the development through which the successive creations have\r\npassed during the history of our planet. But what I wish to prove\r\nhere, by a careful discussion of the facts reported in the\r\nfollowing pages, is the truth of the law now so clearly\r\ndemonstrated in the series of vertebrates, that the successive\r\ncreations have undergone phases of development analogous to those\r\nof the embryo in its growth and similar to the gradations shown by\r\nthe present creation in the ascending series, which it presents as\r\na whole. One may consider it as henceforth proved that the embryo\r\nof the fish during its development, the class of fishes as it at\r\npresent exists in its numerous families, and the type of fish in\r\nits planetary history, exhibit analogous phases through which one\r\nmay follow the same creative thought like a guiding thread in the\r\nstudy of the connection between organized beings.\" Following this\r\ncomparison closely, he shows how the early embryonic condition of\r\nthe present fishes is recalled by the general disposition of the\r\nfins in the fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, and especially by the\r\ncaudal fin, making the unevenly lobed tail, so characteristic of\r\nthese ancient forms. This so called heterocercal tail is only known\r\nto exist, as a permanent adult feature, in the sturgeons of to-day.\r\nThe form of the head and the position of the mouth and eyes in the\r\nfishes of the Old Red were also shown to be analogous with\r\nembryonic phases of our present fishes. From these analogies, and\r\nalso from the ascendancy of fishes as the only known vertebrate,\r\nand therefore as the highest type in those ancient deposits,\r\nAgassiz considered this fauna as representing \"the embryonic age of\r\nthe reign of fishes;\" and he sums up his results in conclusion in\r\nthe following words: \"The facts, taken as a whole, seem to me to\r\nshow, not only that the fishes of the Old Red constitute an\r\nindependent fauna, distinct from those of other deposits, but that\r\nthey also represent in their organization the most remarkable\r\nanalogy with the first phases of embryonic development in the bony\r\nfishes of our epoch, and a no less marked parallelism with the\r\nlower degrees of certain types of the class as it now exists on the\r\nsurface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said by one of the biographers of Agassiz,* (* \"Louis\r\nAgassiz: Notice biographique\" par Ernest Favre.) in reference to\r\nthis work upon the fishes of the Old Red Sandstone: \"It is\r\ndifficult to understand why the results of these admirable\r\nresearches, and of later ones made by him, did not in themselves\r\nlead him to support the theory of transformation, of which they\r\nseem the natural consequence.\" It is true that except for the\r\nfrequent allusion to a creative thought or plan, this introduction\r\nto the Fishes of the Old Red might seem to be written by an\r\nadvocate of the development theory rather than by its most\r\ndetermined opponent, so much does it deal with laws of the organic\r\nworld, now used in support of evolution. These comprehensive laws,\r\nannounced by Agassiz in his \"Poissons Fossiles,\" and afterward\r\nconstantly reiterated by him, have indeed been adopted by the\r\nwriters on evolution, though with a wholly different\r\ninterpretation. No one saw more clearly than Agassiz the relation\r\nwhich he first pointed out, between the succession of animals of\r\nthe same type in time and the phases of their embryonic growth\r\nto-day, and he often said, in his lectures, \"the history of the\r\nindividual is the history of the type.\" But the coincidence between\r\nthe geological succession, the embryonic development, the\r\nzoological gradation, and the geographical distribution of animals\r\nin the past and the present, rested, according to his belief, upon\r\nan intellectual coherence and not upon a material connection. So,\r\nalso, the variability, as well as the constancy, of organized\r\nbeings, at once so plastic and so inflexible, seemed to him\r\ncontrolled by something more than the mechanism of self-adjusting\r\nforces. In this conviction he remained unshaken all his life,\r\nalthough the development theory came up for discussion under so\r\nmany various aspects during that time. His views are now in the\r\ndescending scale; but to give them less than their real prominence\r\nhere would be to deprive his scientific career of its true basis.\r\nBelief in a Creator was the keynote of his study of nature.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the comprehensive results of Agassiz's\r\npaleontological researches, and especially of his \"Fossil Fishes,\"\r\nArnold Guyot says:* (* See \"Biographical Memoir of Louis Agassiz\"\r\npage 28.)--\"Whatever be the opinions which many may entertain as to\r\nthe interpretation of some of these generalizations, the vast\r\nimportance of these results of Agassiz's studies may be appreciated\r\nby the incontestable fact, that nearly all the questions which\r\nmodern paleontology has treated are here raised and in great\r\nmeasure solved. They already form a code of general laws which has\r\nbecome a foundation for the geological history of the life-system,\r\nand which the subsequent investigations of science have only\r\nmodified and extended, not destroyed. Nowhere did the mind of\r\nAgassiz show more power of generalization, more vigor, or more\r\noriginality. The discovery of these great truths is truly his work;\r\nhe derived them immediately from nature by his own observations.\r\nHence it is that all his later zoological investigations tend to a\r\ncommon aim, namely, to give by farther studies, equally\r\nconscientious but more extensive, a broader and more solid basis to\r\nthose laws which he had read in nature and which he had proclaimed\r\nat that early date in his immortal work, 'Poissons Fossiles.' Let\r\nus not be astonished that he should have remained faithful to these\r\nviews to the end of his life. It is because he had SEEN that he\r\nBELIEVED, and such a faith is not easily shaken by new hypotheses.\"\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO SIR PHILIP EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, September 7, 1844.\r\n\r\n. . .I write in all haste to ask for any address to which I can\r\nsafely forward my report on the Sheppy fishes, so that they may\r\narrive without fail in time for the meeting at York. Since my last\r\nletter I have made progress in this kind of research. I have\r\nsacrificed all my duplicates of our present fishes to furnish\r\nskeletons. I have prepared more than a hundred since I last wrote\r\nyou, and I can now determine the family, and even the genus, simply\r\nby seeing the skull. There remains nothing impossible now in the\r\ndetermination of fishes, and if I can obtain certain exotic genera,\r\nwhich I have not as yet, I can make an osteology of fishes as\r\ncomplete as that which we possess for the other classes of\r\nvertebrates. Every family has its special type of skull. All this\r\nis extremely interesting. I have already corrected a mass of\r\ninaccurate identifications established upon external characters;\r\nand as for fossils, I have recognized and characterized seventeen\r\nnew genera among the less perfect undetermined specimens you have\r\nsent me. Several families appear now for the first time among the\r\nfossils. I have been able to determine to what family all the\r\ndoubtful genera belong; indeed Sheppy will prove as rich in species\r\nas Mont Bolca. When you see your specimens again you will hardly\r\nrecognize them, they are so changed; I have chiseled and cleaned\r\nthem, until they are almost like anatomical preparations. Try to\r\nprocure as many more specimens as possible and send them to me. I\r\ncannot stir from Neuchatel, now that I am so fully in the spirit of\r\nwork, and besides it would be a useless expense. . .You will\r\nreceive with my report the three numbers which complete my\r\nmonograph of the Fishes of the Old Red. I feel sure, in advance,\r\nthat you will be satisfied with them. . .\r\n\r\nSIR PHILIP EGERTON TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nTOLLY HOUSE, ALNESS, ROSS-SHIRE. September 15, 1844.\r\n\r\n. . .I have only this day received your letter of the 6th, and I\r\nfear much you will scarcely receive this in time to make it\r\navailable. I shall not be able to reach York for the commencement\r\nof the meeting, but hope to be there on Saturday, September 28th. A\r\nparcel will reach me in the shortest possible time addressed Sir P.\r\nEgerton, Donnington Rectory, York. I am delighted with the bright\r\nresults of your comparison of the Sheppy fossils with recent forms.\r\nYou appear to have opened out an entirely new field of\r\ninvestigation, likely to be productive of most brilliant results.\r\nShould any accident delay the arrival of your monograph for the\r\nYork meeting, I shall make a point of communicating to our\r\nscientific friends the contents of your letter, as I know they will\r\nrejoice to hear of the progress of fossil ichthyology in your\r\nmasterly hands. When next you come, I wish you could spend a few\r\ndays here. We are surrounded on all sides by the debris of the\r\nmoraines of the ancient glaciers that descended the flank of Ben\r\nWyvis, and I think you would find much to interest you in tracing\r\ntheir relations. We have also the Cromarty Fish-beds within a few\r\nmiles, and many other objects of geological interest. . .I shall\r\nsee Lord Enniskillen at York, and will tell him of your success. We\r\nshall, of course, procure all the Sheppy fish we can either by\r\npurchase or exchange. . .\r\n\r\nThe pressure of work upon his various publications detained Agassiz\r\nat home during the summer of 1844. For the first time he was unable\r\nto make one of the glacial party this year, but the work was\r\ncarried on uninterruptedly, and the results reported to him.\r\nMeantime his contemplated journey to the United States flitted\r\nconstantly before him.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO THE PRINCE OF CANINO.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, November 19, 1844.\r\n\r\n. . .Your idea of an illustrated American ichthyology is admirable.\r\nBut for that we ought to have with us an artist clever enough to\r\npaint fishes rapidly from the life. Work but half done is no longer\r\npermissible in our days. . .In this matter I think there is a\r\njustice due to Rafinesque. However poor his descriptions, he\r\nnevertheless first recognized the necessity of multiplying genera\r\nin ichthyology, and that at a time when the thing was far more\r\ndifficult than now. Several of his genera have even the priority\r\nover those now accepted, and I think in the United States it would\r\nbe easier than elsewhere to find again a part of the materials on\r\nwhich he worked. We must not neglect from this time forth to ask\r\nAmericans to put us in the way of extending this work throughout\r\nNorth America. If you accept me for your collaborator, I will at\r\nonce do all that I can on my side to bring together notes and\r\nspecimens. I will write to several naturalists in the United\r\nStates, and tell them that as I am to accompany you on your voyage\r\nI should be glad to know in advance what they have done in\r\nichthyology, so that we may be the better prepared to profit by our\r\nshort sojourn in their country. However, I will do nothing before\r\nhaving your directions, which, for the sake of the matter in hand,\r\nI should be glad to receive as early as possible. . .\r\n\r\nThe next letter announces a new aspect of the projected journey. In\r\nexplanation, it should be said that finding Agassiz might be\r\nprevented by his poverty from going, the prince had invited him to\r\nbe his guest for a summer in the United States.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO THE PRINCE OF CANINO.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, January 7, 1845.\r\n\r\n. . .I have received an excellent piece of news from Humboldt,\r\nwhich I hasten to share with you. I venture to believe that it will\r\nplease you also. . .I had written to Humboldt of our plans, and of\r\nyour kind offer to take me with you to the United States, telling\r\nhim at the same time how much I regretted that I should be unable\r\nto visit the regions which attracted me the most from a geological\r\npoint of view, and asking him if it would be possible to interest\r\nthe king in this journey and obtain means from his majesty for a\r\nlonger stay on the other side of the Atlantic. I have just received\r\na delightful and most unexpected reply. The king will grant me 15,\r\n000 francs for this object, so that I shall, in any event, be able\r\nto make the journey. All the more do I desire to make it in your\r\nsociety, and I think by combining our forces we shall obtain more\r\nimportant results; but I am glad that I can do it without being a\r\nburden to you. Before answering Humboldt, I am anxious to know\r\nwhether your plans are definitely decided upon for this summer, and\r\nwhether this arrangement suits you. . .\r\n\r\nThe pleasant plan so long meditated was not to be fulfilled. The\r\nprince was obliged to defer the journey and never accomplished it.\r\nThis was a great disappointment to Agassiz.\r\n\r\n\"Am I then to go without you,\" he writes; \"is this irrevocable? If\r\nI were to defer my departure till September would it then be\r\npossible for you to leave Rome? It would be too delightful if we\r\ncould make this journey together. I wish also, before starting, to\r\nreview everything that has been done of late in paleontology,\r\nzoology, and comparative anatomy, that I may, in behalf of all\r\nthese sciences, take advantage of the circumstances in which I\r\nshall be placed. . .Whatever befalls me, I feel that I shall never\r\ncease to consecrate my whole energy to the study of nature; its all\r\npowerful charm has taken such possession of me that I shall always\r\nsacrifice everything to it; even the things which men usually value\r\nmost.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz had determined, before starting on his journey, to complete\r\nall his unfinished works, and to put in order his correspondence\r\nand collections, including the vast amount of specimens sent him\r\nfor identification or for his own researches. The task of \"setting\r\nhis house in order\" for a change which, perhaps, he dimly felt to\r\nbe more momentous than it seemed, proved long and laborious. From\r\nall accounts, he performed prodigies of work, but the winter and\r\nspring passed, and the summer of 1845 found him still at his post.\r\n\r\nHumboldt writes him not without anxiety lest his determination to\r\ncomplete all the tasks he had undertaken, including the\r\nNomenclator, should involve him in endless delays and perplexities.\r\n\r\nHUMBOLDT TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, September 16, 1845.\r\n\r\n. . .Your Nomenclator frightens me with its double entries. The\r\nMilky Way must have crossed your path, for you seem to be dealing\r\nwith nebulae which you are trying to resolve into stars. For pity's\r\nsake husband your strength. You treat this journey as if it were\r\nfor life. As to finishing,--alas! my friend, one does not finish.\r\nConsidering all that you have in your well-furnished brain beside\r\nyour accumulated papers, half the contents of which you do not\r\nyourself know, your expression \"aufraumen,\"--to put in final order,\r\nis singularly inappropriate. There will always remain some\r\nburdensome residue,--last things not yet accounted for. I beg you,\r\nthen, not to abuse your strength. Be content to finish only what\r\nseems to you nearest completion,--the most advanced of your work.\r\n\r\nYour letter reached me, unaccompanied, however, by the books it\r\nannounces. They are to come, no doubt, in some other way. Spite of\r\nthe demands made upon me by the continuation of my \"Cosmos,\" I\r\nshall find time to read and profit by your introduction to the Old\r\nRed. I am inclined to sing hymns of praise to the Hyperboreans who\r\nhave helped you in this admirable work. What you say of the\r\nspecific difference in vertical line and of the increased number of\r\nbiological epochs is full of interest and wisdom. No wonder you\r\nrebel against the idea that the Baltic contains microscopic animals\r\nidentical with those of the chalk! I foresee, however, a new battle\r\nof Waterloo between you and my friend Ehrenberg, who accompanied me\r\nlately, just after the Victoria festivals, to the volcanoes of the\r\nEifel with Dechen. Not an inch of ground without infusoria in those\r\nregions! For Heaven's sake do not meddle with the infusoria before\r\nyou have seen the Canada Lakes and completed your journey. Defer\r\nthem till some more tranquil period of your life. . .I must close\r\nmy letter with the hope that you will never doubt my warm\r\naffection. Assuredly I shall find no fault with any course of\r\nlectures you may give in the new world, nor do I see the least\r\nobjection to giving them for money. You can thus propagate your\r\nfavorite views and spread useful knowledge, while at the same time\r\nyou will, by most honorable and praiseworthy means, provide\r\nadditional funds for your traveling expenses. . .\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence with Professor Adam Sedgwick is of\r\ninterest, as showing his attitude and that of Agassiz toward\r\nquestions which have since acquired a still greater scientific\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ADAM SEDGWICK TO LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nTRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, April 10, 1845.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PROFESSOR,\r\n\r\nThe British Association is to meet here about the middle of June,\r\nand I trust that the occasion will again bring you to England and\r\ngive me the great happiness of entertaining you in Trinity College.\r\nIndeed, I wish very much to see you; for many years have now\r\nelapsed since I last had that pleasure. May God long preserve your\r\nlife, which has been spent in promoting the great ends of truth and\r\nknowledge! Your great work on fossil fishes is now before me, and I\r\nalso possess the first number of your monograph upon the fishes of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone. I trust the new numbers will follow the\r\nfirst in rapid succession. I love now and then to find a\r\nresting-place; and your works always give me one. The opinions of\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire and his dark school seem to be gaining some\r\nground in England. I detest them, because I think them untrue. They\r\nshut out all argument from DESIGN and all notion of a Creative\r\nProvidence, and in so doing they appear to me to deprive physiology\r\nof its life and strength, and language of its beauty and meaning. I\r\nam as much offended in taste by the turgid mystical bombast of\r\nGeoffroy as I am disgusted by his cold and irrational materialism.\r\nWhen men of his school talk of the elective affinity of organic\r\ntypes, I hear a jargon I cannot comprehend, and I turn from it in\r\ndisgust; and when they talk of spontaneous generation and\r\ntransmutation of species, they seem to me to try nature by an\r\nhypothesis, and not to try their hypothesis by nature. Where are\r\ntheir facts on which to form an inductive truth? I deny their\r\nstarting condition. \"Oh! but\" they reply, \"we have progressive\r\ndevelopment in geology.\" Now, I allow (as all geologists must do) a\r\nKIND OF PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT. For example, the first fish are\r\nbelow the reptiles; and the first reptiles older than man. I say,\r\nwe have successive forms of animal life adapted to successive\r\nconditions (so far, proving design), and not derived in natural\r\nsuccession in the ordinary way of generation. But if no single fact\r\nin actual nature allows us to suppose that the new species and\r\norders were produced successively in the natural way, how did they\r\nbegin? I reply, by a way out of and above common known, material\r\nnature, and this way I call CREATION. Generation and creation are\r\ntwo distinct ideas, and must be described by two distinct words,\r\nunless we wish to introduce utter confusion of thought and\r\nlanguage. In this view I think you agree with me; for I spoke to\r\nyou on the subject when we met (alas, TEN years since!) at Dublin.\r\nWould you have the great kindness to give me your most valuable\r\nopinion on one or two points?\r\n\r\n(1.) Is it possible, according to the known laws of actual nature,\r\nor is it probable, on any analogies of nature, that the vast series\r\nof fish, from those of the Ludlow rock and the Old Red Sandstone to\r\nthose of our actual seas, lakes, and rivers, are derived from one\r\ncommon original low type, in the way of development and by\r\npropagation or natural breeding? I should say, NO. But my knowledge\r\nis feeble and at second-hand. Yours is strong and from the\r\nfountain-head.\r\n\r\n(2.) Is the organic type of fish higher now than it was during the\r\ncarboniferous period, when the Sauroids so much abounded? If the\r\nprogressive theory of Geoffroy be true, in his sense, each class of\r\nanimals ought to be progressive in its organic type. It appears to\r\nme that this is not true. Pray tell me your own views on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n(3.) There are \"ODD FISH\" (as we say in jest) in the Old Red\r\nSandstone. Do these so graduate into crustaceans as to form\r\nanything like such an organic link that one could, by generation,\r\ncome naturally from the other? I should say, NO, being instructed\r\nby your labors. Again, allowing this, for the sake of argument, are\r\nthere not much higher types of fish which are contemporaneous with\r\nthe lower types (if, indeed, they be lower), and do not these\r\nnobler fish of the Old Red Sandstone stultify the hypothesis of\r\nnatural generative development?\r\n\r\n(4.) Will you give me, in a few general words, your views of the\r\nscale occupied by the fish of the Old Red, considered as a natural\r\ngroup? Are they so rudimentary as to look like abortions or\r\ncreatures derived from some inferior class, which have not yet by\r\ndevelopment reached the higher type of fish? Again, I should say,\r\nNO; but I long for an answer from a great authority like yours. I\r\nam most anxious for a good general conception of the fish of the\r\nOld Red, with reference to some intelligible scale.\r\n\r\n(5.) Lastly, is there the shadow of ground for supposing that by\r\nany natural generative development the Ichthyosaurians and other\r\nkindred forms of reptile have come from Sauroid, or any other type\r\nof fish? I believe you will say, NO. At any rate, the facts of\r\ngeology lend no support to such a view, for the nobler forms of\r\nReptile appear in strata below those in which the Ichthyosaurians,\r\netc., are first seen. But I must not trouble you with more\r\nquestions. Professor Whewell is now Master of Trinity College. We\r\nshall all rejoice to see you.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Professor, your most faithful and most grateful\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nA. SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nFROM LOUIS AGASSIZ TO A. SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nNEUCHATEL, June, 1845.\r\n\r\n. . .I reproach myself for not acknowledging at once your most\r\ninteresting letter of April 10th. But you will easily understand\r\nthat in the midst of the rush of work consequent upon my\r\npreparation for a journey of several years' duration I have not\r\nnoticed the flight of time since I received it, until to-day, when\r\nthe sight of the date fills me with confusion. And yet, for years,\r\nI have not received a letter which has given me greater pleasure or\r\nmoved me more deeply. I have felt in it and have received from it\r\nthat vigor of conviction which gives to all you say or write a\r\nvirile energy, captivating alike to the listener or the reader.\r\nLike you, I am pained by the progress of certain tendencies in the\r\ndomain of the natural sciences; it is not only the arid character\r\nof this philosophy of nature (and by this I mean, not NATURAL\r\nPHILOSOPHY, but the \"Natur-philosophie\" of the Germans and French)\r\nwhich alarms me. I dread quite as much the exaggeration of\r\nreligious fanaticism, borrowing fragments from science, imperfectly\r\nor not at all understood, and then making use of them to prescribe\r\nto scientific men what they are allowed to see or to find in\r\nNature. Between these two extremes it is difficult to follow a safe\r\nroad. The reason is, perhaps, that the domain of facts has not yet\r\nreceived a sufficiently general recognition, while traditional\r\nbeliefs still have too much influence upon the study of the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nWishing to review such ideas as I had formed upon these questions,\r\nI gave a public course this winter upon the plan of creation as\r\nshown in the development of the animal kingdom. I wish I could send\r\nit to you, for I think it might please you. Unhappily, I had no\r\ntime to write it out, and have not even an outline of it. But I\r\nintend to work further upon this subject and make a book upon it\r\none of these days. If I speak of it to-day it is because in this\r\ncourse I have treated all the questions upon which you ask my\r\nopinion. Let me answer them here after a somewhat aphoristic\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nI find it impossible to attribute the biological phenomena, which\r\nhave been and still are going on upon the surface of our globe, to\r\nthe simple action of physical forces. I believe they are due, in\r\ntheir entirety, as well as individually, to the direct intervention\r\nof a creative power, acting freely and in an autonomic way. . .I\r\nhave tried to make this intentional plan in the organization of the\r\nanimal kingdom evident, by showing that the differences between\r\nanimals do not constitute a material chain, analogous to a series\r\nof physical phenomena, bound together by the same law, but present\r\nthemselves rather as the phases of a thought, formulated according\r\nto a definite aim. I think we know enough of comparative anatomy to\r\nabandon forever the idea of the transformation of the organs of one\r\ntype into those of another. The metamorphoses of certain animals,\r\nand especially of insects, so often cited in support of this idea,\r\nprove, by the fixity with which they repeat themselves in\r\ninnumerable species, exactly the contrary. In the persistency of\r\nthese metamorphoses, distinct for each species and known to repeat\r\nthemselves annually in a hundred thousand species, and to have done\r\nso ever since the present order of things was established on the\r\nearth, have we not the most direct proof that the diversity of\r\ntypes is not due to external natural influences? I have followed\r\nthis idea in all the types of the animal kingdom. I have also tried\r\nto show the direct intervention of a creative power in the\r\ngeographical distribution of organized beings on the surface of the\r\nglobe when the species are definitely circumscribed. As evidence of\r\nthe fixity of generic types and the existence of a higher and free\r\ncausal power, I have made use of a method which appears to me new\r\nas a process of reasoning. The series of reptiles, for instance, in\r\nthe family of lizards, shows apodal forms, forms with rudimentary\r\nfeet, then with a successively larger number of fingers until we\r\nreach, by seemingly insensible gradations, the genera Anguis,\r\nOphisaurus, and Pseudopus, the Chamosauria, Chirotes, Bipes, Sepo,\r\nScincus, and at last the true lizards. It would seem to any\r\nreasonable man that these types are the transformations of a single\r\nprimitive type, so closely do the modifications approach each\r\nother; and yet I now reject any such supposition, and after having\r\nstudied the facts most thoroughly, I find in them a direct proof of\r\nthe creation of all these species. It must not be forgotten that\r\nthe genus Anguis belongs to Europe, the Ophisaurus to North\r\nAmerica, the Pseudopus to Dalmatia and the Caspian steppe, the Sepo\r\nto Italy, etc. Now, I ask how portions of the earth so absolutely\r\ndistinct could have combined to form a continuous zoological\r\nseries, now so strikingly distributed, and whether the idea of this\r\ndevelopment could have started from any other source than a\r\ncreative purpose manifested in space? These same purposes, this\r\nsame constancy in the employment of means toward a final end, may\r\nbe read still more clearly in the study of the fossils of the\r\ndifferent creations. The species of all the creations are\r\nmaterially and genealogically as distinct from each other as those\r\nof the different points on the surface of the globe. I have\r\ncompared hundreds of species reputed identical in various\r\nsuccessive deposits,--species which are always quoted in favor of a\r\ntransition, however indirect, from one group of species to another,\r\n--and I have always found marked specific differences between them.\r\nIn a few weeks I will send you a paper which I have just printed on\r\nthis subject, where it seems to me this view is very satisfactorily\r\nproved. The idea of a procreation of new species by preceding ones\r\nis a gratuitous supposition opposed to all sound physiological\r\nnotions. And yet it is true that, taken as a whole, there is a\r\ngradation in the organized beings of successive geological\r\nformations, and that the end and aim of this development is the\r\nappearance of man. But this serial connection of all successive\r\ncreatures is not material; taken singly these groups of species\r\nshow no relation through intermediate forms genetically derived one\r\nfrom the other. The connection between them becomes evident only\r\nwhen they are considered as a whole emanating from a creative\r\npower, the author of them all. To your special questions I may now\r\nvery briefly reply.\r\n\r\nHave fishes descended from a primitive type? So far am I from\r\nthinking this possible, that I do not believe there is a single\r\nspecimen of fossil or living fish, whether marine or fresh-water,\r\nthat has not been created with reference to a special intention and\r\na definite aim, even though we may be able to detect but a portion\r\nof these numerous relations and of the essential purpose.\r\n\r\nAre the present fishes superior to the older ones? As a general\r\nproposition, I would say, NO; it seems to me even that the fishes\r\nwhich preceded the appearance of reptiles in the plan of creation\r\nwere higher in certain characters than those which succeeded them;\r\nand it is a strange fact that these ancient fishes have something\r\nanalogous with reptiles, which had not then made their appearance.\r\nOne would say that they already existed in the creative thought,\r\nand that their coming, not far removed, was actually anticipated.\r\n\r\nCan the fishes of the Old Red be considered the embryos of those of\r\nlater epochs? Of course they are the first types of the vertebrate\r\nseries, including the most ancient of the Silurian system; but they\r\neach constitute an independent fauna, as numerous in the places\r\nwhere these earlier fishes are found, as the present fishes in any\r\narea of similar extent on our sea-shore to-day. I now know one\r\nhundred and four species of fossil fish from the Old Red, belonging\r\nto forty-four genera, comprised under seven families, between\r\nseveral of which there is but little analogy as to organization. It\r\nis therefore impossible to look upon them as coming from one\r\nprimitive stock. The primitive diversity of these types is quite as\r\nremarkable as that of those belonging to later epochs. It is\r\nnevertheless true that, regarded as part of the general plan of\r\ncreation, this fauna presents itself as an inferior type of the\r\nvertebrate series, connecting itself directly in the creative\r\nthought with the realization of later forms, the last of which (and\r\nthis seems to me to have been the general end of creation) was to\r\nplace man at the head of organized beings as the key-stone and term\r\nof the whole series, the final point in the premeditated intention\r\nof the primitive plan which has been carried out progressively in\r\nthe course of time. I would even say that I believe the creation of\r\nman has closed creation on this earth, and I draw this conclusion\r\nfrom the fact that the human genus is the first cosmopolite type in\r\nNature. One may even affirm that man is clearly announced in the\r\nphases of organic development of the animal kingdom as the final\r\nterm of this series.\r\n\r\nLastly: Is there any reason to believe that the Ichthyosaurians are\r\ndescendants of the Sauroid fishes which preceded the appearance of\r\nthese reptiles? Not the least. I should consider any naturalist who\r\nwould seriously present the question in this light as incapable of\r\ndiscussing it or judging it. He would place himself outside of the\r\nfacts and would reason from a basis of his own creating. . .\r\n\r\nIn the \"Revue Suisse\" of April, 1845, there is a notice of the\r\ncourse of lectures to which reference is made in the above letter.\r\n\r\n\"A numerous audience assembled on the 26th of March for the opening\r\nof a course by Professor Agassiz on the 'Plan of Creation.' It is\r\nwith an ever new pleasure that our public come together to listen\r\nto this savant, still so young and already so celebrated. Not\r\ncontent with pursuing in seclusion his laborious scientific\r\ninvestigations, he makes a habit of communicating, almost annually,\r\nto an audience less restricted than that of the Academy the general\r\nresult of some of his researches. All the qualities to which Mr.\r\nAgassiz has accustomed his listeners were found in the opening\r\nprelude; the fullness and freedom of expression which give to his\r\nlectures the character of a scientific causerie; the dignified ease\r\nof bearing, joined with the simplicity and candor of a savant who\r\nteaches neither by aphorisms nor oracles, but who frankly admits\r\nthe public to the results of his researches; the power of\r\ngeneralization always based upon a patient study of facts, which he\r\nknows how to present with remarkable clearness in a language that\r\nall can understand. We will not follow the professor in tracing the\r\noutlines of his course. Suffice it to say that he intends to show\r\nin the general development of the animal kingdom the existence of a\r\ndefinite preconceived plan, successively carried out; in other\r\nwords, the manifestation of a higher thought,--the thought of God.\r\nThis creative thought may be studied under three points of view: as\r\nshown in the relations which, spite of their manifold diversity,\r\nconnect all the species now living on the surface of the globe; in\r\ntheir geographical distribution; and in the succession of beings\r\nfrom primitive epochs until the present condition of things.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1845 was the last which Agassiz passed at home. It\r\nwas broken by a short and hurried visit to the glacier of the Aar,\r\nrespecting which no details have been preserved. He did not then\r\nknow that he was taking a final leave of his cabin among the rocks\r\nand ice. Affairs connected with the welfare of the institution in\r\nNeuchatel, with which he had been so long connected, still detained\r\nhim for a part of the winter, and he did not leave for Paris until\r\nthe first week in March, 1846. His wife and daughters had already\r\npreceded him to Germany, where he was to join them again on his way\r\nto Paris, and where they were to pass the period of his absence,\r\nunder the care of his brother-in-law, Mr. Alexander Braun, then\r\nliving at Carlsruhe. His son was to remain at school at Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nIt was two o'clock at night when he left his home of so many years.\r\nThere had been a general sadness at the thought of his departure,\r\nand every testimony of affection and respect accompanied him. The\r\nstudents came in procession with torch-lights to give him a parting\r\nserenade, and many of his friends and colleagues were also present\r\nto bid him farewell. M. Louis Favre says in his Memoir, \"Great was\r\nthe emotion at Neuchatel when the report was spread abroad that\r\nAgassiz was about to leave for a long journey. It is true he\r\npromised to come back, but the New World might shower upon him such\r\nmarvels that his return could hardly be counted upon. The young\r\npeople, the students, regretted their beloved professor not only\r\nfor his scientific attainments, but for his kindly disposition, the\r\ncharm of his eloquence, the inspiration of his teaching; they\r\nregretted also the gay, animated, untiring companion of their\r\nexcursions, who made them acquainted with nature, and knew so well\r\nhow to encourage and interest them in their studies.\"\r\n\r\nPausing at Carlsruhe on his journey, he proceeded thence to Paris,\r\nwhere he was welcomed with the greatest cordiality by scientific\r\nmen. In recognition of his work on the \"Fossil Fishes\" the Monthyon\r\nPrize of Physiology was awarded him by the Academy. He felt this\r\ndistinction the more because the bearing of such investigations\r\nupon experimental physiology had never before been pointed out, and\r\nit showed that he had succeeded in giving a new direction and a\r\nmore comprehensive character to paleontological research. He passed\r\nsome months in Paris, busily occupied with the publication of the\r\n\"Systeme Glaciaire,\" his second work on the glacial phenomena. The\r\n\"Etudes sur les Glaciers\" had simply contained a resume of all the\r\nresearches undertaken upon the Alpine fields of ice and the results\r\nobtained up to 1840, inclusive of the author's own work and his\r\nwider interpretation of the facts. The \"Systeme Glaciaire\" was, on\r\nthe contrary, an account of a connected plan of investigation\r\nduring a succession of years, upon a single glacier, with its\r\ngeodetic and topographic features, its hydrography, its internal\r\nstructure, its atmospheric conditions, its rate of annual and\r\ndiurnal progress, and its relations to surrounding glaciers. All\r\nthe local phenomena, so far as they could be observed, were\r\nsubjected to a strict scrutiny, and the results corrected by\r\ncareful comparison, during five seasons. As we have seen, and as\r\nAgassiz himself says in his Preface, this band of workers had\r\n\"lived in the intimacy of the glacier, striving to draw from it the\r\nsecret of its formation and its annual advance.\" The work was\r\naccompanied by three maps and nine plates. In such a volume of\r\ndetail there is no room for picturesque description, and little is\r\ntold of the wonderful scenes they witnessed by day and night,\r\nnothing of personal peril and adventure.\r\n\r\nThis task concluded, he went to England, where he was to spend the\r\nfew remaining days previous to his departure. Among the last words\r\nof farewell which reached him just as he was leaving the Old World,\r\nlittle thinking then that he was to make a permanent home in\r\nAmerica, were these lines from Humboldt, written at Sans Souci: \"Be\r\nhappy in this new undertaking, and preserve for me the first place\r\nunder the head of friendship in your heart. When you return I shall\r\nbe here no more, but the king and queen will receive you on this\r\n'historic hill' with the affection which, for so many reasons, you\r\nmerit. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Your illegible but much attached friend,\r\n\r\n\"A. HUMBOLDT.\"\r\n\r\nSo closed this period of Agassiz's life. The next was to open in\r\nnew scenes, under wholly different conditions. He sailed for\r\nAmerica in September, 1846.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\nIN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\n1846: AGE 39.\r\n\r\nArrival at Boston.\r\nPrevious Correspondence with Charles Lyell and Mr. John A. Lowell\r\n   concerning Lectures at the Lowell Institute.\r\nRelations with Mr. Lowell.\r\nFirst Course of Lectures.\r\nCharacter of Audience.\r\nHome Letter giving an Account of his first Journey\r\n   in the United States.\r\nImpressions of Scientific Men, Scientific Institutions\r\n   and Collections.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ arrived in Boston during the first week of October, 1846.\r\nHe had not come to America without some prospect of employment\r\nbeside that comprised in his immediate scientific aims. In 1845,\r\nwhen his plans for a journey in the United States began to take\r\ndefinite shape, he had written to ask Lyell whether,\r\nnotwithstanding his imperfect English, he might not have some\r\nchance as a public lecturer, hoping to make in that way additional\r\nprovision for his scientific expenses beyond the allowance he was\r\nto receive from the King of Prussia. Lyell's answer, written by his\r\nwife, was very encouraging.\r\n\r\nLONDON, February 28, 1845.\r\n\r\n. . .My husband thinks your plan of lecturing a very good one, and\r\nsure to succeed, for the Americans are fond of that kind of\r\ninstruction. We remember your English was pleasant, and if you have\r\nbeen practicing since, you have probably gained facility in\r\nexpression, and a little foreign accent would be no drawback. You\r\nmight give your lectures in several cities, but he would like very\r\nmuch if you could give a course at the Lowell Institute at Boston,\r\nan establishment which pays very highly. . .In six weeks you might\r\nearn enough to pay for a twelve months' tour, besides passing an\r\nagreeable time at Boston, where there are several eminent\r\nnaturalists. . .As my husband is writing to Mr. Lowell to-morrow\r\nupon other matters, he will ask him whether there is any course still\r\nopen, for he feels sure in that case they would be glad to have\r\nyou. . .Mr. Lowell is sole trustee of the Institute, and can nominate\r\nwhom he pleases. It was very richly endowed for the purpose of\r\nlectures by a merchant of Boston, who died a few years ago. You\r\nwill get nothing like the same remuneration anywhere else. . .\r\n\r\nLyell and Mr. Lowell soon arranged all preliminaries, and it was\r\nunderstood that Agassiz should begin his tour in the United States\r\nby a course of lectures in Boston before the Lowell Institute. A\r\nmonth or two before sailing he writes as follows to Mr. Lowell.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 6, 1846.\r\n\r\n. . .Time is pressing, summer is running away, and I feel it a duty\r\nto write to you about the contemplated lectures, that you may not\r\nbe uncertain about them. So far as the subject is concerned, I am\r\nquite ready; all the necessary illustrations are also completed,\r\nand if I am not mistaken they must by this time be in your hands\r\n. . .I understand from Mr. Lyell that you wish me to lecture in\r\nOctober. For this also I am quite prepared, as I shall, immediately\r\nafter my arrival in Boston, devote all my time to the consideration\r\nof my course. If a later date should suit your plans better, I have\r\nno objection to conform to any of your arrangements, as I shall at\r\nall events pass the whole winter on the shores of the Atlantic, and\r\nbe everywhere in reach of Boston in a very short time. . .With your\r\napprobation, I would give to my course the title of \"Lectures on\r\nthe Plan of the Creation, especially in the Animal Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThus was Agassiz introduced to the institution under whose auspices\r\nhe first made acquaintance with his American audiences. There he\r\nbecame a familiar presence during more than a quarter of a century.\r\nThe enthusiastic greeting accorded to him, as a stranger whose\r\nreputation had preceded him, ripened with years into an\r\naffectionate welcome from friends and fellow-citizens, whenever he\r\nappeared on the platform. In the director of the institution, Mr.\r\nJohn A. Lowell, he found a friend upon whose sympathy and wise\r\ncounsels he relied in all his after years. The cordial reception he\r\nmet from him and his large family circle made him at once at home\r\nin a strange land.\r\n\r\nNever was Agassiz's power as a teacher, or the charm of his\r\npersonal presence more evident than in his first course of Lowell\r\nLectures. He was unfamiliar with the language, to the easy use of\r\nwhich his two or three visits in England, where most of his\r\nassociates understood and spoke French, had by no means accustomed\r\nhim. He would often have been painfully embarrassed but for his own\r\nsimplicity of character. Thinking only of his subject and never of\r\nhimself, when a critical pause came, he patiently waited for the\r\nmissing word, and rarely failed to find a phrase which was\r\nexpressive if not technically correct. He often said afterward that\r\nhis sole preparation for these lectures consisted in shutting\r\nhimself up for hours and marshaling his vocabulary, passing in\r\nreview, that is, all the English words he could recall. As the\r\nLyells had prophesied, his foreign accent rather added a charm to\r\nhis address, and the pauses in which he seemed to ask the\r\nforbearance of the audience, while he sought to translate his\r\nthought for them, enlisted their sympathy. Their courtesy never\r\nfailed him. His skill in drawing with chalk on the blackboard was\r\nalso a great help both to him and to them. When his English was at\r\nfault he could nevertheless explain his meaning by illustrations so\r\ngraphic that the spoken word was hardly missed. He said of himself\r\nthat he was no artist, and that his drawing was accurate simply\r\nbecause the object existed in his mind so clearly. However this may\r\nbe, it was always pleasant to watch the effect of his drawings on\r\nthe audience. When showing, for instance, the correspondence of the\r\narticulate type, as a whole, with the metamorphoses of the higher\r\ninsects, he would lead his listeners along the successive phases of\r\ninsect development, talking as he drew and drawing as he talked,\r\ntill suddenly the winged creature stood declared upon the\r\nblackboard, almost as if it had burst then and there from the\r\nchrysalis, and the growing interest of his hearers culminated in a\r\nburst of delighted applause.\r\n\r\nAfter the first lecture in Boston there was no doubt of his\r\nsuccess. He carried his audience captive. His treatment of the\r\nanimal kingdom on the broad basis of the comparative method, in\r\nwhich the great types were shown in their relation to each other\r\nand to the physical history of the world, was new to his hearers.\r\nAgassiz had also the rare gift of divesting his subject of\r\ntechnicalities and superfluous details. His special facts never\r\nobscured the comprehensive outline, which they were intended to\r\nfill in and illustrate.\r\n\r\nThis simplicity of form and language was especially adapted to the\r\naudience he had now to address, little instructed in the facts or\r\nthe nomenclature of science, though characterized by an eager\r\ncuriosity. A word respecting the quality of the Lowell Institute\r\naudience of those days, as new to the European professor as he to\r\nthem, is in place here. The institution was intended by its founder\r\nto fertilize the general mind rather than to instruct the selected\r\nfew. It was liberally endowed, the entrance was free, and the\r\ntickets were drawn by lot. Consequently the working men and women\r\nhad as good an opportunity for places as their employers. As the\r\nremuneration, however, was generous, and the privilege of lecturing\r\nthere was coveted by literary and scientific men of the first\r\neminence, the instruction was of a high order, and the tickets, not\r\nto be had for money, were as much in demand with the more\r\ncultivated and even with the fashionable people of the community as\r\nwith their poorer neighbors. This audience, composed of strongly\r\ncontrasted elements and based upon purely democratic principles,\r\nhad, from the first, a marked attraction for Agassiz. A teacher in\r\nthe widest sense, he sought and found his pupils in every class.\r\nBut in America for the first time did he come into contact with the\r\ngeneral mass of the people on this common ground, and it influenced\r\nstrongly his final resolve to remain in this country. Indeed, the\r\nsecret of his greatest power was to be found in the sympathetic,\r\nhuman side of his character. Out of his broad humanity grew the\r\ngenial personal influence, by which he awakened the enthusiasm of\r\nhis audiences for unwonted themes, inspired his students to\r\ndisinterested services like his own, delighted children in the\r\nschool-room, and won the cordial interest as well as the\r\ncooperation in the higher aims of science, of all classes whether\r\nrich or poor.\r\n\r\nHis first course was to be given in December. Having, therefore, a\r\nfew weeks to spare, he made a short journey, stopping at New Haven\r\nto see the elder Silliman, with whom he had long been in\r\ncorrespondence. Shortly before leaving Europe he had written him,\r\n\"I can hardly tell you with what pleasure I look forward to seeing\r\nyou, and making the personal acquaintance of the distinguished\r\nsavans of your country, whose works I have lately been studying\r\nwith especial care. There is something captivating in the\r\nprodigious activity of the Americans, and the thought of contact\r\nwith the superior men of your young and glorious republic renews my\r\nown youth.\" Some account of this journey, including his first\r\nimpressions of the scientific men as well as the scientific\r\nsocieties and collections of the United States, is given in the\r\nfollowing letter. It is addressed to his mother, and with her to a\r\nsocial club of intimate friends and neighbors in Neuchatel, at\r\nwhose meetings he had been for years an honored guest.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, December, 1846.\r\n\r\n. . .Having no time to write out a complete account of my journey\r\nof last month, I will only transcribe for you some fugitive notes\r\nscribbled along the road in stages or railroad carriages. They bear\r\nthe stamp of hurry and constant interruption.\r\n\r\nLeaving Boston the 16th of October, I went by railroad to New\r\nHaven, passing through Springfield. The rapidity of the locomotion\r\nis frightful to those who are unused to it, but you adapt yourself\r\nto the speed, and soon become, like all the rest of the world,\r\nimpatient of the slightest delay. I well understand that an\r\nantipathy for this mode of travel is possible. There is something\r\ninfernal in the irresistible power of steam, carrying such heavy\r\nmasses along with the swiftness of lightning. The habits growing\r\nout of continued contact with railroads, and the influence they\r\nexert on a portion of the community, are far from agreeable until\r\none is familiar with them. You would cry out in dismay did you see\r\nyour baggage flung about pell-mell like logs of wood, trunks,\r\nchests, traveling-bags, hat-boxes, all in the same mill, and if\r\nhere and there something goes to pieces no one is astonished; never\r\nmind! we go fast,--we gain time,--that is the essential thing.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the country differ so greatly from ours that it\r\nseems to me impossible to form a just estimate regarding them, or,\r\nindeed, to pronounce judgment at all upon a population so active\r\nand mobile as that of the Northern States of the Union, without\r\nhaving lived among them for a long time. I do not therefore attempt\r\nany such estimate. I can only say that the educated Americans are\r\nvery accessible and very pleasant. They are obliging to the utmost\r\ndegree; indeed, their cordiality toward strangers exceeds any that\r\nI have met elsewhere. I might even add that if I could complain of\r\nanything it would be of an excess, rather than a lack, of\r\nattention. I have often found it difficult to make it understood\r\nthat the hotel, where I can work at my ease, suits me better than\r\nthe proffered hospitality. . .\r\n\r\nBut what a country is this! all along the road between Boston and\r\nSpringfield are ancient moraines and polished rocks. No one who had\r\nseen them upon the track of our present glaciers could hesitate as\r\nto the real agency by which all these erratic masses, literally\r\ncovering the country, have been transported. I have had the\r\npleasure of converting already several of the most distinguished\r\nAmerican geologists to my way of thinking; among others, Professor\r\nRogers, who will deliver a public lecture upon the subject next\r\nTuesday before a large audience.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of American life is to be found in the\r\nfrequent public meetings where addresses are delivered. Shortly\r\nafter my arrival in Boston I was present at a meeting of some three\r\nthousand workmen, foremen of workshops, clerks, and the like. No\r\nmeeting could have been more respectable and well-conducted. All\r\nwere neatly dressed; even the simplest laborer had a clean shirt.\r\nIt was a strange sight to see such an assemblage, brought together\r\nfor the purpose of forming a library, and listening attentively in\r\nperfect quiet for two hours to an address on the advantages of\r\neducation, of reading, and the means of employing usefully the\r\nleisure moments of a workman's life. The most eminent men vie with\r\neach other in instructing and forming the education of the\r\npopulation at large. I have not yet seen a man out of employment or\r\na beggar, except in New York, which is a sink for the emptyings of\r\nEurope. Yet do not think that I forget the advantages of our old\r\ncivilization. Far from it. I feel more than ever the value of a\r\npast which belongs to you and in which you have grown up.\r\nGenerations must pass before America will have the collections of\r\nart and science which adorn our cities, or the establishments for\r\npublic instruction, sanctuaries as it were, consecrated by the\r\ndevotion of those who give themselves wholly to study. Here all the\r\nworld works to gain a livelihood or to make a fortune. Few\r\nestablishments (of learning) are old enough, or have taken\r\nsufficiently deep root in the habits of the people, to be safe from\r\ninnovation; very few institutions offer a combination of studies\r\nsuch as, in its ensemble, meets the demands of modern civilization.\r\nAll is done by the single efforts of individuals or of\r\ncorporations, too often guided by the needs of the moment. Thus\r\nAmerican science lacks the scope which is characteristic of higher\r\ninstruction in our old Europe. Objects of art are curiosities but\r\nlittle appreciated and usually still less understood. On the other\r\nhand, the whole population shares in the advanced education\r\nprovided for all. . .From Springfield the railroad follows the\r\ncourse of the Connecticut as far as Hartford, turning then directly\r\ntoward the sea-coast. The valley strikingly resembles that of the\r\nRhine between Carlsruhe and Heidelberg. The same rock, the same\r\naspect of country, and gres bigarre* (* Trias.) everywhere. The\r\nforest reminds one of Odenwald and of Baden-Baden. Nearer the coast\r\nare cones of basalt like those of Brissac and the Kaiserstuhl. The\r\nerratic phenomena are also very marked in this region; polished\r\nrocks everywhere, magnificent furrows on the sandstone and on the\r\nbasalt, and parallel moraines defining themselves like ramparts\r\nupon the plain.\r\n\r\nAt New Haven I passed several days at the house of Professor\r\nSilliman, with whom I have been in correspondence for several\r\nyears. The University (Yale) owes to the efforts of the Professor a\r\nfine collection of minerals and extensive physical and chemical\r\napparatus. Silliman is the patriarch of science in America. For\r\nthirty years he has edited an important scientific journal, the\r\nchannel through which, ever since its foundation, European\r\nscientific researches have reached America. . .One of his\r\nsons-in-law, Mr. Shepard,* (* An error: Mr. Shepard was not the\r\nson-in-law of Professor Silliman.--ED.) is also chemical professor\r\nin the University of South Carolina. Another, Mr. Dana, still a\r\nvery young man, strikes me as likely to be the most distinguished\r\nnaturalist of the United States. He was a member of the expedition\r\naround the world under the command of Captain Wilkes, and has just\r\npublished a magnificent volume containing monographs of all the\r\nspecies of polyps and corals, with curious observations on their\r\nmode of growth and on the coral islands. I was surprised to find in\r\nthe collection at New Haven a fine specimen of the great fossil\r\nsalamander of Oeningen, the \"Homo diluvii testis\" of Scheuchzer.\r\n\r\nFrom New Haven I went to New York by steamboat. The Sound, between\r\nLong Island and the coast of Connecticut, presents a succession of\r\ncheerful towns and villages, with single houses scattered over the\r\ncountry, while magnificent trees overhang the sea; we constantly\r\ndisturbed numbers of aquatic birds which, at our approach,\r\nfluttered up around the steamer, only to alight farther on. I have\r\nnever seen such flocks of ducks and gulls.\r\n\r\nAt New York I hastened to see Auguste Mayor, of whom my uncle will\r\nno doubt have given you news, since I wrote to him. Obliged to\r\ncontinue my road in order to join Mr. Gray at Princeton I stopped\r\nbut one day in New York, the greater part of which I passed with\r\nMr. Redfield, author of a paper on the fossil fishes of\r\nConnecticut. His collection, which he has placed at my disposal,\r\nhas great interest for me; it contains a large number of fossil\r\nfishes of different kinds, from a formation in which but one\r\nspecies has been found in Europe. The new red sandstone of\r\nConnecticut will also fill a gap in the history of fossil fishes,\r\nand this acquisition is so much the more important, because, at the\r\nepoch of the gres bigarre, a marked change took place in the\r\nanatomical character of fishes. It presents an intermediate type\r\nbetween the primitive fishes of the ancient deposits and the more\r\nregular forms of the jurassic deposits.\r\n\r\nMr. Asa Gray, professor of botany at Cambridge, near Boston, had\r\noffered to accompany me on my journey to Washington. We were to\r\nmeet at the house of Professor Torrey, at Princeton, a small town\r\nhalf a day's journey from New York, and the seat of a considerable\r\nuniversity, one of the oldest in the United States. The physical\r\ndepartment, under the direction of Professor Henry, is remarkably\r\nrich in models of machinery and in electrical apparatus, to which\r\nthe professor especially devotes himself. The museum contains a\r\ncollection of animals and fossil remains. In the environs of the\r\ntown, in the ditches, is found a rare kind of turtle, remarkable\r\nfor the form of the jaws and the length of the tail. I wish very\r\nmuch to procure one, were it only to oblige Professor Johannes\r\nMuller, of Berlin, who especially desires one for investigation.\r\nBut I have failed thus far; the turtles are already withdrawn into\r\ntheir winter quarters. Mr. Torrey promises me some, however, in the\r\nspring. It is not easy to get them because their bite is dreaded.\r\n\r\nAfter this I passed four days in Philadelphia. Here,\r\nnotwithstanding my great desire to see the beautiful country along\r\nthe shores of the rich bay of Delaware and the banks of the\r\nSchuylkill, between which the city lies, I was entirely occupied\r\nwith the magnificent collections of the Academy of Science and of\r\nthe Philosophical Society. The zoological collections of the\r\nAcademy of Science are the oldest in the United States, the only\r\nones, except those of the Wilkes Expedition, which can equal in\r\ninterest those of Europe. There are the collections of Say, the\r\nearliest naturalist of distinction in the United States; there are\r\nalso the fossil remains and the animals described by Harlan, by\r\nGodman, and by Hayes, and the fossils described by Conrad and\r\nMorton. Dr. Morton's unique collection of human skulls is also to\r\nbe found in Philadelphia. Imagine a series of six hundred skulls,\r\nmostly Indian, of all the tribes who now inhabit or formerly\r\ninhabited America. Nothing like it exists elsewhere. This\r\ncollection alone is worth a journey to America. Dr. Morton has had\r\nthe kindness to give me a copy of his great illustrated work\r\nrepresenting all the types of his collection. Quite recently a\r\ngenerous citizen of Philadelphia has enriched this museum with the\r\nfine collection of birds belonging to the Duke of Rivoli. He bought\r\nit for 37,000 francs, and presented it to his native city.\r\n\r\nThe number of fossil remains comprised in these collections is very\r\nconsiderable; mastodons especially, and fossils of the cretaceous\r\nand jurassic deposits. . .Imagine that all this is at my full\r\ndisposal for description and illustration, and you will understand\r\nmy pleasure. The liberality of the American naturalists toward me\r\nis unparalleled.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention Mr. Lea's collection of fresh-water\r\nshells,--a series of the magnificent Unios of the rivers and lakes\r\nof America, comprising four hundred species, represented by some\r\nthirty specimens of each. Mr. Lea has promised me specimens of all\r\nthe species. Had I not been bound by an engagement at Washington,\r\nand could I have remained three or four days longer in order to\r\nlabel and pack them, I might have taken at once these valuable\r\nobjects, which will be of great importance in verifying and\r\nrectifying the synonyms of European conchologists. After having\r\nseen the astonishing variations undergone by these shells in their\r\ngrowth, I am satisfied that all which European naturalists have\r\nwritten on this subject must be revised. Only with the help of a\r\nvery full series of individuals can one fully understand these\r\nanimals, and we have only single specimens in our collections. If I\r\nhad time and means to have drawings made of all these forms, the\r\ncollection of Mr. Lea would be at my command for the purpose, and\r\nthe work would be a very useful one for science.\r\n\r\nThere are several other private and public collections at\r\nPhiladelphia, which I have only seen cursorily; that of the Medical\r\nSchool, for instance, and that of the older Peale, who discovered\r\nthe first mastodon found in the United States, now mounted in his\r\nmuseum. Beside these, there is the collection of Dr. Griffith, rich\r\nin skulls from the Gulf of Mexico; that of Mr. Ord, and others.\r\nDuring my stay in Philadelphia, there was also an exhibition of\r\nindustrial products at the Franklin Institute, where I especially\r\nremarked the chemical department. There are no less than three\r\nprofessors of chemistry in Philadelphia,--Mr. Hare, Mr. Booth, and\r\nMr. Frazer. The first is, I think, the best known in Europe.\r\n\r\nHow a nearer view changes the aspect of things! I thought myself\r\ntolerably familiar with all that is doing in science in the United\r\nStates, but I was far from anticipating so much that is interesting\r\nand important. What is wanting to all these men is neither zeal nor\r\nknowledge. In both, they seem to compete with us, and in ardor and\r\nactivity they even surpass most of our savans. What they need is\r\nleisure. I have never felt more forcibly what I owe to the king for\r\nenabling me to live for science alone, undisturbed by anxieties and\r\ndistractions. Here, I do not lose a moment, and when I receive\r\ninvitations outside the circle of men whom I care particularly to\r\nknow, I decline, on the ground that I am not free to dispose for my\r\npleasure of time which does not belong to me. For this no one can\r\nquarrel with me, and so far as I myself am concerned, it is much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nI stopped at Baltimore only long enough to see the city. It was\r\nSunday, and as I could make no visits, and was anxious to arrive in\r\ngood time at Washington, I took advantage of the first train. The\r\ncapital of the United States is laid out upon a gigantic scale,\r\nand, consequently, portions of the different quarters are often to\r\nbe traced only by isolated houses here and there,--a condition\r\nwhich has caused it to be called the \"City of Magnificent\r\nDistances.\" Some of the streets are very handsome, and the capitol\r\nitself is really imposing. Their profound veneration for the\r\nfounder of their liberty and their republic is a noble trait of the\r\nAmerican people. The evidences of this are to be seen everywhere.\r\nNo less than two hundred towns, villages, and counties bear his\r\nname, rather to the inconvenience of the postal administration.\r\n\r\nAfter having visited the capitol and the presidential mansion, and\r\ndelivered my letters for the Prussian Minister, I went to the\r\nMuseum of the National Institute. I was impatient to satisfy myself\r\nas to the scientific value of the results obtained in the field of\r\nmy own studies by the voyage of Captain Wilkes around the world,\r\n--this voyage having been the object of equally exaggerated praise\r\nand criticism. I confess that I was agreeably surprised by the\r\nrichness of the zoological and geological collections; I do not\r\nthink any European expedition has done more or better; and in some\r\ndepartments, in that of the Crustacea, for example, the collection\r\nat Washington surpasses in beauty and number of specimens all that\r\nI have seen. It is especially to Dr. Pickering and Mr. Dana that\r\nthese collections are due. As the expedition did not penetrate to\r\nthe interior of the continents in tropical regions, the collections\r\nof birds and mammals, which fell to the charge of Mr. Peale, are\r\nless considerable. Mr. Gray tells me, however, that the botanical\r\ncollections are very large. More precious, perhaps, than all the\r\ncollections are the magnificent drawings of mollusks, zoophytes,\r\nfishes, and reptiles, painted from life by Mr. Drayton. All these\r\nplates, to the number of about six hundred, are to be engraved, and\r\nindeed are already, in part, executed. I can only compare them to\r\nthose of the Astrolabe, although they are very superior in variety\r\nof position and naturalness of attitude to those of the French\r\nExpedition. This is particularly true of the mollusks and fishes.\r\nThe zoophytes are to be published; they are admirable in detail.\r\nThe hydrographic portion and the account of the voyage, edited by\r\nCaptain Wilkes (unhappily he was absent and I did not see him), has\r\nbeen published for some time, and comprises an enormous mass of\r\ninformation, its chief feature being charts to the number of two\r\nhundred. It is amazing; the number of soundings extraordinarily\r\nlarge.* (* Agassiz subsequently took some part in working up the\r\nfish collections from this expedition, but the publication was\r\nstopped for want of means to carry it on.)\r\n\r\nAt Washington are also to be seen the headquarters of the Coast\r\nSurvey, where the fine charts of the coasts and harbors now making\r\nunder direction of Dr. Bache are executed. These charts are\r\nadmirably finished. Dr. Bache, the superintendent, was in camp, so\r\nthat I could not deliver my letters for him. I saw, however,\r\nColonel Abert, the head of the topographic office, who gave me\r\nimportant information about the West for the very season when I am\r\nlikely to be there. I am indebted to him also for a series of\r\ndocuments concerning the upper Missouri and Mississippi, California\r\nand Oregon, printed by order of the government, and for a\r\ncollection of fresh-water shells from those regions. I should like\r\nto offer him, in return, such sheets of the Federal Map as have\r\nappeared. I beg Guyot to send them to me by the first occasion.\r\n\r\nAs I was due in Boston on an appointed day I was obliged to defer\r\nmy visit to Richmond, Charleston, and other places in the South. I\r\nhad, beside, gathered so much material that I had need of a few\r\nquiet weeks to consider and digest it all. Returning therefore to\r\nPhiladelphia, I made there the acquaintance of Mr. Haldeman, author\r\nof a monograph on the fresh-water shells of the United States. I\r\nhad made an appointment to meet him at Philadelphia, being unable\r\nto make a detour of fifty leagues in order to visit him at his own\r\nhome, which is situated beyond the lines of rapid transit. He is a\r\ndistinguished naturalist, equally well versed in several branches\r\nof our science. He has made me acquainted, also, with a young\r\nnaturalist from the interior of Pennsylvania, Mr. Baird, professor\r\nat Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, who offered me\r\nduplicates from his collections of birds and other animals. In\r\norder to avail myself more promptly of this and like acquisitions,\r\nI wish that M. Coulon would send me at the close of the winter all\r\nthat he can procure of the common European birds, of our small\r\nmammalia, and some chamois skins, adding also the fish that Charles\r\nput aside for me before his departure. It would be safest to send\r\nthem to the care of Auguste Mayor.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia I separated from my traveling companion, Mr. Gray,\r\nwho was obliged to return to his home. From Philadelphia, Mr.\r\nHaldeman and Mr. Lea accompanied me to Bristol, where Mr. Vanuxem\r\npossesses an important collection of fossils from ancient deposits,\r\nduplicates of which he promises me. Mr. Vanuxem is one of the\r\nofficial geologists of the State of New York, and author of one of\r\na series of volumes upon the geology of the State, about which I\r\nshall presently have something to say. To gain time I took the\r\nnight train from Bristol to New York, and arrived at Mayor's at\r\nmidnight, having written him to expect me.\r\n\r\nThe next day I visited the market, and in five days I had filled a\r\ngreat barrel with different kinds of fish and fresh-water turtles,\r\nbeside making several skeletons and various dissections of\r\nmollusks. Wishing to employ my time as usefully as possible, I\r\npostponed my visits to the savans of the city, and the delivery of\r\nmy letters, till I was on the eve of departure, that I might avoid\r\nall invitations. I had especial pleasure in making the acquaintance\r\nof the two Le Contes, father and son, who own the finest collection\r\nof insects in the United States. I can easily make some thousand\r\nexchanges with them when I receive those that M. Coulon has put\r\naside for me, with a view to exchange. . .Every morning Auguste\r\nMayor went with me to the market before going to his office and\r\nhelped me to carry my basket when it was too heavy. One day I\r\nbrought back no less than twenty-four turtles, taken in one draught\r\nof the net. I made four skeletons, and dissected several others.\r\nUnder such conditions the day ought to have thirty-six working\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWere I an artist, instead of describing my voyage from New York to\r\nAlbany, I would draw you a panorama of the shores of the Hudson. I\r\nknow nothing except the banks of the Rhine to compare with those of\r\nthis magnificent river. The resemblance between them is striking;\r\nthe sites, the nature of the rocks, the appearance of the towns and\r\nvillages, the form of the Albany bridges, even the look of the\r\ninhabitants, of whom the greater number are of Dutch or German\r\norigin,--all are similar.\r\n\r\nI stopped at West Point to make the acquaintance of Professor\r\nBailey of the Military School there. I already knew him by\r\nreputation. He is the author of very detailed and interesting\r\nresearches upon the microscopic animalcules of America. I had a\r\npamphlet to deliver to him from Ehrenberg, who has received from\r\nhim a great deal of material for his large work on fossil\r\nInfusoria. I spent three most delightful days with him, passed\r\nchiefly in examining his collections, from which he gave me many\r\nspecimens. We also made several excursions in the neighborhood, in\r\norder to study the erratic phenomena and the traces of glaciers,\r\nwhich everywhere cover the surface of the country. Polished rocks,\r\nas distinct as possible; moraines continuous over large spaces;\r\nstratified drift, as on the borders of the glacier of Grindelwald;\r\nin short, all the usual accompaniments of the glaciers are there,\r\nand one may follow the \"roches moutonnees\" with the eye to a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAlbany is the seat of government of the State of New York. It has a\r\nmedical school, an agricultural society, a geological museum, an\r\nanatomical museum, and a museum of natural history. The government\r\nhas just completed the publication of a work, unique of its kind, a\r\nnatural history of the State in sixteen volumes, quarto, with\r\nplates; twenty-five hundred copies have been printed, only five\r\nhundred of which are for sale, the rest being distributed\r\nthroughout the State. Four volumes are devoted to geology and\r\nmining alone, the others to zoology, botany, and agriculture. Yes,\r\ntwenty-five hundred copies of a work in sixteen volumes, quarto,\r\nscattered throughout the State of New York alone! When I think that\r\nI began my studies in natural history by copying hundreds of pages\r\nfrom a Lamarck which some one had lent me, and that to-day there is\r\na State in which the smallest farmer may have access to a costly\r\nwork, worth a library to him in itself, I bless the efforts of\r\nthose who devote themselves to public instruction. . .I have not\r\nneglected the opportunity offered by the North River (the Hudson)\r\nfor the study of the fresh-water fishes of this country. I have\r\nfilled a barrel with them. The species differ greatly from ours,\r\nwith the exception of the perch, the eel, the pike, and the sucker,\r\nin which only a practiced eye could detect the difference; all the\r\nrest belong to genera unknown in Europe, or, at least, in\r\nSwitzerland. . .\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to procure also, in the few days of my stay,\r\nall the species taken in the lakes and rivers around Albany.\r\nSeveral others have been given me from Lake Superior. Since my\r\nreturn to Boston I have been collecting birds and comparing them\r\nwith those of Europe. If M. Coulon could obtain for me a collection\r\nof European eggs, even the most common, I could exchange them for\r\nan admirable series of the native species here. I have also\r\nprocured several interesting mammals; among others, two species of\r\nhares different from those I brought from Halifax, striped\r\nsquirrels, etc.\r\n\r\nI will tell you another time something of the collections of Boston\r\nand Cambridge, the only ones in the United States which can rival\r\nthose of Philadelphia. To-day I have made my first attempt at\r\nlecturing. Of that, also, I will tell you more in my next letter,\r\nwhen I know how it has been liked. It is no small matter to satisfy\r\nan audience of three thousand people in a language with which you\r\nare but little familiar. . .\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14.\r\n\r\n1846-1847: AGE 39-40.\r\n\r\nCourse of Lectures in Boston on Glaciers.\r\nCorrespondence with Scientific Friends in Europe.\r\nHouse in East Boston.\r\nHousehold and Housekeeping.\r\nIllness.\r\nLetter to Elie de Beaumont.\r\nLetter to James D. Dana.\r\n\r\nTHE course at the Lowell Institute was immediately followed by one\r\nupon glaciers, the success of which was guaranteed by private\r\nsubscription,--an unnecessary security, since the audience,\r\nattracted by the novelty and picturesqueness of the subject, as\r\nwell as by the charm of presentation and fullness of illustration,\r\nwas large and enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was evidently encouraged himself by his success, for toward\r\nthe close of his Lowell Lectures he writes as follows:--\r\n\r\nTO CHANCELLOR FAVARGEZ.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, December 31, 1846.\r\n\r\n. . .Beside my lecture course, now within a few days of its\r\nconclusion, and the ever-increasing work which grows on my hands in\r\nproportion as I become familiar with the environs of Boston, where\r\nI shall still remain a few weeks longer, I have so much to do in\r\nkeeping up my journals, notes, and observations that I have not\r\nfound a moment to write you since the last steamer. . .Never did\r\nthe future look brighter to me than now. If I could for a moment\r\nforget that I have a scientific mission to fulfill, to which I will\r\nnever prove recreant, I could easily make more than enough by\r\nlectures which would be admirably paid and are urged upon me, to\r\nput me completely at my ease hereafter. But I will limit myself to\r\nwhat I need in order to repay those who have helped me through a\r\ndifficult crisis, and that I can do without even turning aside from\r\nmy researches. Beyond that all must go again to science,--there\r\nlies my true mission. I rejoice in what I have been able to do thus\r\nfar, and I hope that at Berlin they will be satisfied with the\r\nresults which I shall submit to competent judges on my return. If I\r\nonly have time to finish what I have begun! You know my plans are\r\nnot wont to be too closely restricted.\r\n\r\nWhy do you not write to me? Am I then wholly forgotten in your\r\npleasant circle while my thoughts are every day constantly with my\r\nNeuchatel friends?. . .\r\n\r\nMidnight, January 1st. A happy new year to you and to all members\r\nof the Tuesday Club. Bonjour et bon an. . .\r\n\r\nSome portions of Agassiz's correspondence with his European friends\r\nand colleagues during the winter and summer of 1847 give a clew to\r\nthe occupations and interests of his new life, and keep up the\r\nthread of the old one.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ TO M. DECAISNE.\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1847.\r\n\r\n. . .I write only to thank you for the pleasure your note gave me.\r\nWhen one is far away, as I am, from everything belonging to one's\r\npast life, the merest sign of friendly remembrance is a boon. Do\r\nnot infer from this that America does not please me. On the\r\ncontrary, I am delighted with my stay here, although I do not quite\r\nunderstand all that surrounds me; or I should perhaps rather say\r\nthat many principles which, theoretically, we have been wont to\r\nthink perfect in themselves, seem in their application to involve\r\nresults quite contrary to our expectations. I am constantly asking\r\nmyself which is better,--our old Europe, where the man of\r\nexceptional gifts can give himself absolutely to study, opening\r\nthus a wider horizon for the human mind, while at his side\r\nthousands barely vegetate in degradation or at least in\r\ndestitution; or this new world, where the institutions tend to keep\r\nall on one level as part of the general mass,--but a mass, be it\r\nsaid, which has no noxious elements. Yes, the mass here is\r\ndecidedly good. All the world lives well, is decently clad, learns\r\nsomething, is awake and interested. Instruction does not, as in some\r\nparts of Germany for instance, furnish a man with an intellectual\r\ntool and then deny him the free use of it. The strength of America\r\nlies in the prodigious number of individuals who think and work at\r\nthe same time. It is a severe test of pretentious mediocrity, but\r\nI fear it may also efface originality . . .You are right in\r\nbelieving that one works, or at least that one CAN work, better\r\nin Paris than elsewhere, and I should esteem myself happy if I had\r\nmy nest there, but who will make it for me? I am myself incapable\r\nof making efforts for anything but my work. . .\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO MILNE EDWARDS.\r\n\r\nMay 31, 1847.\r\n\r\n. . .After six weeks of an illness which has rendered me unfit for\r\nserious work I long to be transported into the circle of my Paris\r\nfriends, to find myself again among the men whose devotion to\r\nscience gives them a clear understanding of its tendency and\r\ninfluence. Therefore I take my way quite naturally to the Rue\r\nCuvier and mount your stairs, confident that there I shall find\r\nthis chosen society. Question upon question greets me regarding\r\nthis new world, on the shore of which I have but just landed, and\r\nyet about which I have so much to say that I fear to tire my\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\nNaturalist as I am, I cannot but put the people first,--the people\r\nwho have opened this part of the American continent to European\r\ncivilization. What a people! But to understand them you must live\r\namong them. Our education, the principles of our society, the\r\nmotives of our actions, differ so greatly from what I see here,\r\nthat I should try in vain to give you an idea of this great nation,\r\npassing from childhood to maturity with the faults of spoiled\r\nchildren, and yet with the nobility of character and the enthusiasm\r\nof youth. Their look is wholly turned toward the future; their\r\nsocial life is not yet irrevocably bound to exacting antecedents,\r\nand thus nothing holds them back, unless, perhaps, a consideration\r\nfor the opinion in which they may be held in Europe. This deference\r\ntoward England (unhappily, to them, Europe means almost exclusively\r\nEngland) is a curious fact in the life of the American people. They\r\nknow us but little, even after having made a tour in France, or\r\nItaly, or Germany. From England they receive their literature, and\r\nthe scientific work of central Europe reaches them through English\r\nchannels. . .Notwithstanding this kind of dependence upon England,\r\nin which American savans have voluntarily placed themselves, I have\r\nformed a high opinion of their acquirements, since I have learned\r\nto know them better, and I think we should render a real service to\r\nthem and to science, by freeing them from this tutelage, raising\r\nthem in their own eyes, and drawing them also a little more toward\r\nourselves. Do not think that these remarks are prompted by the\r\nleast antagonism toward English savans, whom no one more than\r\nmyself has reason to regard with affection and esteem. But since\r\nthese men are so worthy to soar on their own wings, why not help\r\nthem to take flight? They need only confidence, and some special\r\nrecognition from Europe would tend to give them this. . .\r\n\r\nAmong the zoologists of this country I would place Mr. Dana at the\r\nhead. He is still very young, fertile in ideas, rich in facts,\r\nequally able as geologist and mineralogist. When his work on corals\r\nis completed, you can better judge of him. One of these days you\r\nwill make him a correspondent of the Institute, unless he kills\r\nhimself with work too early, or is led away by his tendency to\r\ngeneralization. Then there is Gould, author of the malacologic\r\nfauna of Massachusetts, and who is now working up the mollusks of\r\nthe Wilkes Expedition. De Kay and Lea, whose works have long been\r\nknown, are rather specialists, I should say. I do not yet know\r\nHolbrook personally. Pickering, of the Wilkes Expedition, is a well\r\nof science, perhaps the most erudite naturalist here. Haldeman\r\nknows the fresh-water gasteropods of this country admirably well,\r\nand has published a work upon them. Le Conte is a critical\r\nentomologist who seems to me thoroughly familiar with what is doing\r\nin Europe. In connection with Haldeman he is working up the\r\narticulates of the Wilkes Expedition. Wyman, recently made\r\nprofessor at Cambridge, is an excellent comparative anatomist, and\r\nthe author of several papers on the organization of fishes. . .The\r\nbotanists are less numerous, but Asa Gray and Dr. Torrey are known\r\nwherever the study of botany is pursued. Gray, with his\r\nindefatigable zeal, will gain upon his competitors. . .The\r\ngeologists and mineralogists form the most numerous class among the\r\nsavans of the country. The fact that every state has its corps of\r\nofficial geologists has tended to develop study in this direction\r\nto the detriment of other branches, and will later, I fear, tend to\r\nthe detriment of science itself; for the utilitarian tendency thus\r\nimpressed on the work of American geologists will retard their\r\nprogress. With us, on the contrary, researches of this kind\r\nconstantly tend to assume a more and more scientific character.\r\nStill, the body of American geologists forms, as a whole, a most\r\nrespectable contingent. The names of Charles T. Jackson, James\r\nHall, Hitchcock, Henry and William Rogers (two brothers), have long\r\nbeen familiar to European science. After the geologists, I would\r\nmention Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia, well known as the author of\r\nseveral papers upon fossils, and still better by his great work\r\nupon the indigenous races of America. He is a man of science in the\r\nbest sense; admirable both as regards his knowledge and his\r\nactivity. He is the pillar of the Philadelphia Academy.\r\n\r\nThe chemists and physicists, again, form another utilitarian class\r\nof men in this country. As with many of them purely scientific work\r\nis not their sole object, it is difficult for an outsider to\r\ndistinguish between the clever manipulators and those who have\r\nhigher aims. . .\r\n\r\nThe mathematicians have also their culte, dating back to Bowditch,\r\nthe translator of the \"Mecanique celeste,\" and the author of a work\r\non practical navigation. He died in Boston, where they are now\r\nerecting a magnificent monument to his memory. Mr. Peirce,\r\nprofessor at Cambridge, is considered here the equal of our great\r\nmathematicians. It is not for me, who cannot do a sum in addition,\r\nto pretend to a judgment in the matter.* (* Though Agassiz was no\r\nmathematician, and Peirce no naturalist, they soon found that their\r\nintellectual aims were the same, and they became very close\r\nfriends.)\r\n\r\nYou are familiar, no doubt, with the works of Captain Wilkes and\r\nthe report of his journey around the world. His charts are much\r\npraised. The charts of the coasts and harbors of the United States,\r\nmade under the direction of Dr. Bache and published at government\r\nexpense, are admirable. The reports of Captain Fremont concerning\r\nhis travels are also most interesting and instructive; to botanists\r\nespecially so, on account of the scientific notes accompanying\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI will not speak at length of my own work,--my letter is already\r\ntoo long. During the winter I have been chiefly occupied in making\r\ncollections of fishes and birds, and also of the various woods. The\r\nforests here differ greatly from ours in the same latitude. I have\r\neven observed that they resemble astonishingly the forests of the\r\nMolasse epoch, and the analogy is heightened by that between the\r\nanimals of this country and those of the eastern coasts of Asia as\r\ncompared with those of the Molasse, such as the chelydras, andreas,\r\netc. I will send a report upon this to M. Brongniart as soon as I\r\nhave the time to prepare it. On the erratic phenomena, also, I have\r\nmade numerous observations, which I am anxious to send to M. de\r\nBeaumont. These phenomena, so difficult of explanation with us,\r\nbecome still more complicated here, both on account of their\r\ncontact with the sea and of the vast stretches of flat country over\r\nwhich they extend.\r\n\r\nFor the last few days I have been especially occupied with the\r\ndevelopment of the medusae. In studying the actiniae I have made a\r\nstriking discovery, and I should be glad if you would communicate\r\nit to the Academy in advance of the illustrated paper on the same\r\nsubject, which I hope soon to send you. Notwithstanding their\r\nstar-like appearance, the star-fishes have, like the sea-urchins,\r\nindications by no means doubtful, of a symmetrical disposition of\r\ntheir organs in pairs, and an anterior and posterior extremity\r\neasily recognized by the special form of their oral opening. I have\r\nnow satisfied myself that the madrepores have something analogous\r\nto this in the arrangement of their partitions, so that I am\r\ntempted to believe that this tendency to a symmetrical arrangement\r\nof parts in pairs, is a general character of polyps, disguised by\r\ntheir radiating form. Among the medusae something similar exists in\r\nthe disposition of the marginal appendages and the ocelli. I attach\r\nthe more importance to these observations, because they may lead to\r\na clearer perception than we have yet reached of the natural\r\nrelations between the radiates and the other great types of the\r\nanimal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis summer I hope to explore the lower lakes of Canada, and also\r\nthe regions lying to the eastward as far as Nova Scotia; in the\r\nautumn I shall resume my excursions on the coast and in the\r\nAlleghenies, and shall pass a part of the winter in the Carolinas.\r\nI will soon write to Monsieur Brongniart concerning my plans for\r\nnext year. If the Museum were desirous to aid me in my\r\nundertakings, I should like to make a journey of exploration next\r\nsummer in a zone thus far completely neglected by naturalists, the\r\nregion, namely, of the small lakes to the west of Lake Superior,\r\nwhere the Mississippi takes its rise, and also of that lying\r\nbetween this great basin of fresh water and the southern arm of\r\nHudson Bay. I would employ the autumn in exploring the great valley\r\nof the Mississippi, and would pass the winter on the borders of the\r\nGulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo carry out such projects, however, I have need of larger\r\nresources than I can create by my own efforts, and I shall soon be\r\nat the end of the subsidy granted me by the King of Prussia. I\r\nshall, however, subordinate all these projects to the possibilities\r\nof which you kindly tell me. Notwithstanding the interest offered\r\nby the exploration of a country so rich as this, notwithstanding\r\nthe gratifying welcome I have received here, I feel, after all,\r\nthat nowhere can one work better than in our old Europe, and the\r\nfriendship you have shown me is a more than sufficient motive,\r\nimpelling me to return as soon as possible to Paris. Remember me\r\nto our common friends. I have made some sufficiently interesting\r\ncollections which I shall forward to the Museum; they will show\r\nyou that I have done my best to fulfill my promises, forgetting\r\nno one. . .\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1847 Agassiz established himself in a small house\r\nat East Boston, sufficiently near the sea to be a convenient\r\nstation for marine collections. Here certain members of his old\r\nworking corps assembled about him, and it soon became, like every\r\nplace he had ever inhabited, a hive of industry. Chief among his\r\ncompanions were Count Francois de Pourtales, who had accompanied\r\nhim to this country; Mr. E. Desor, who soon followed him to\r\nAmerica; and Mr. Jacques Burkhardt, who had preceded them all, and\r\nwas now draughtsman in chief to the whole party. To his labors were\r\nsoon added those of Mr. A. Sonrel, the able lithographic artist,\r\nwho illustrated the most important works subsequently published by\r\nAgassiz. To an exquisite skill in his art he added a quick,\r\nintelligent perception of structural features from the naturalist's\r\npoint of view, which made his work doubly valuable. Besides those\r\nabove-mentioned, there were several assistants who shared the\r\nscientific work in one department or another.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that this rather original establishment had\r\nthe aspect of a laboratory rather than a home, domestic comfort\r\nbeing subordinate to scientific convenience. Every room served in\r\nsome sort the purposes of an aquarium or a studio, while garret and\r\ncellar were devoted to collections. The rules of the household were\r\nsufficiently elastic to suit the most erratic student. A sliding\r\nscale for meals allowed the greatest freedom for excursions along\r\nthe neighboring shores and beaches, and punctuality in work was the\r\nonly punctuality demanded.\r\n\r\nAgassiz himself was necessarily often absent, for the maintenance\r\nof the little colonydepended in great degree upon his exertions.\r\nDuring the winter of 1847, while continuing his lectures in Boston\r\nand its vicinity, he lectured in other places also. It is difficult\r\nto track his course at this time; but during the winters of 1847\r\nand 1848 he lectured in all the large eastern cities, New York,\r\nAlbany, Philadelphia, and Charleston, S.C. Everywhere he drew large\r\ncrowds, and in those days his courses of lectures were rarely\r\nallowed to close without some public expression of gratitude and\r\nappreciation from the listeners. Among his papers are preserved\r\nseveral sets of resolutions from medical and scientific societies,\r\nfrom classes of students, and from miscellaneous audiences,\r\nattesting the enthusiasm awakened by his instruction. What he\r\nearned in this way enabled him to carry on his work and support his\r\nassistants. Still, the strain upon his strength, combined with all\r\nthat he was doing beside in purely scientific work, was severe, and\r\nbefore the twelvemonth was out he was seriously ill. At this time\r\nDr. B.E. Cotting, a physician whose position as curator of the\r\nLowell Institute had brought him into contact with Agassiz, took\r\nhim home to his house in the country, where he tended him through\r\nsome weeks of tedious illness, hastening his convalescence by\r\nexcursions in all the neighboring country, from which they returned\r\nladen with specimens,--plants, birds, etc. In this hospitable home\r\nhe passed his fortieth birthday, the first in this country. His\r\nhost found him standing thoughtful and abstracted by the window.\r\n\"Why so sad?\" he asked. \"That I am so old, and have done so\r\nlittle,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks he was able to return to his work, and the next\r\nletter gives some idea of his observations, especially upon the\r\ntraces of glacial action in the immediate vicinity of Boston and\r\nupon the shores of Massachusetts Bay. Indeed, he never lost sight\r\nof these features, which had caught his attention the moment he\r\nlanded on the continent. In one of his later lectures he gives a\r\nstriking account of this first impression.\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1846,\" he says, \"six years after my visit to\r\nGreat Britain in search of glaciers, I sailed for America. When the\r\nsteamer stopped at Halifax, eager to set foot on the new continent\r\nso full of promise for me, I sprang on shore and started at a brisk\r\npace for the heights above the landing. On the first undisturbed\r\nground, after leaving the town, I was met by the familiar signs,\r\nthe polished surfaces, the furrows and scratches, the LINE\r\nENGRAVING, so well known in the Old World; and I became convinced\r\nof what I had already anticipated as the logical sequence of my\r\nprevious investigations, that here also this great agent had been\r\nat work.\" The incident seems a very natural introduction to the\r\nfollowing letter, written a few months later:--\r\n\r\nTO ELIE DE BEAUMONT.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, August 31, 1847.\r\n\r\n. . .I have waited to write until I should have some facts\r\nsufficiently important to claim your attention. In truth, the study\r\nof the marine animals, which I am, for the first time, able to\r\nobserve in their natural conditions of existence, has engrossed me\r\nalmost exclusively since I came to the United States, and only\r\nincidentally, as it were, I have turned my attention to\r\npaleontology and geology. I must, however, except the glacial\r\nphenomena, a problem, the solution of which always interests me\r\ndeeply. This great question, far from presenting itself more simply\r\nhere, is complicated by peculiarities never brought to my notice in\r\nEurope. Happily for me, Mr. Desor, who had been in Scandinavia\r\nbefore joining me here, called my attention at once to certain\r\npoints of resemblance between the phenomena there and those which I\r\nhad seen in the neighborhood of Boston. Since then, we have made\r\nseveral excursions together, have visited Niagara, and, in short,\r\nhave tried to collect all the special facts of glacial phenomena in\r\nAmerica. . .You are, no doubt, aware that the whole rocky surface\r\nof the ground here is polished. I do not think that anywhere in the\r\nworld there exist polished and rounded rocks in better preservation\r\nor on a larger scale. Here, as elsewhere, erratic debris are\r\nscattered over these surfaces, scratched pebbles impacted in mud,\r\nforming unstratified masses mixed with and covered by large erratic\r\nboulders, more or less furrowed or scratched, the upper ones being\r\nusually angular and without marks. The absence of moraines,\r\nproperly so-called, in a country so little broken, is not\r\nsurprising; I have, however, seen very distinct ones in some\r\nvalleys of the White Mountains and in Vermont. Up to this time\r\nthere had been nothing very new in the aspect of the phenomena as a\r\nwhole; but on examining attentively the internal arrangement of all\r\nthese materials, especially in the neighborhood of the sea, one\r\nsoon becomes convinced that the ocean has partially covered and\r\nmore or less remodeled them. In certain places there are patches of\r\nstratified sand interposed between masses of glacial drift-deposit;\r\nelsewhere, banks of sand and pebbles crown the irregularities of\r\nthe glacial deposit, or fill in its depressions; in other\r\nlocalities the glacial pebbles may be washed and completely cleared\r\nof mud, retaining, however, their markings; or again, these\r\nmarkings may have disappeared, and the material is arranged in\r\nlines or ramparts, as it were, of diverse conformation, in which\r\nMr. Desor recognized all the modifications of the \"oesars\" of\r\nScandinavia. The disposition of the oesars, as seen here, is\r\nevidently due entirely to the action of the waves, and their\r\nfrequency along the coast is a proof of this. In a late excursion\r\nwith Captain Davis on board a government vessel I learned to\r\nunderstand the mode of formation of the submarine dikes bordering\r\nthe coast at various distances, which would be oesars were they\r\nelevated; with the aid of the dredge I satisfied myself of their\r\nidentity. With these facts before me I cannot doubt that the oesars\r\nof the United States consist essentially of glacial material\r\nremodeled by the sea; while farther inland, though here and there\r\nreaching the sea-coast, we have unchanged glacial drift deposit. At\r\nsome points the alteration is so slight as to denote only a\r\nmomentary rise of the sea. Under these circumstances one would\r\nnaturally look for fossils in the drift, and M. Desor, in company\r\nwith M. de Pourtales, was the first to find them, at Brooklyn, in\r\nLong Island, which lies to the south of New York. They were\r\nimbedded in a glacial clay deposit, having all the ordinary\r\ncharacter of such deposits, with only slight traces of stratified\r\nsand. It is true that the greater number of these fossils (all\r\nbelonging to species now living on the coast) were broken into\r\nangular fragments, not excepting even the thick tests of the Venus\r\nmercenaria. . .\r\n\r\nThe suburb of Boston where I am living (East Boston) is built on an\r\nisland, one kilometer and a half long, extending from north to\r\nsoutheast, and varying in width at different points from two to six\r\nor seven hundred metres. Its height above the sea-level is about\r\nsixty feet. This little island is composed entirely of glacial\r\nmuddy deposit, containing scratched pebbles mixed with larger\r\nboulders or blocks, and covered also with a considerable number of\r\nboulders of divers forms and dimensions. At East Boston you cannot\r\nsee what underlies this deposit; but no doubt it rests upon a\r\nrounded mass of granite, polished and grooved like several others\r\nin Boston harbor. . .\r\n\r\nIn our journey to Niagara, Mr. Desor and I assured ourselves that\r\nthe river deposits, in which, among other things, the mastodon is\r\nfound with the fresh-water shells of Goat Island, are posterior to\r\nthe drift. It is a fact worth consideration that the mastodons\r\nfound in Europe are buried in true tertiary formations, while the\r\ngreat mastodon of the United States is certainly posterior to the\r\ndrift. . .In another letter I will tell you something of my\r\nobservations upon the geographical distribution of marine animals\r\nat different depths and on different bottoms, and also upon the\r\nrelations between this distribution and that of the fossils in the\r\ntertiary deposits. . .* (* I have left out a portion of this letter\r\nwhich appeared in the first edition of the book, because I learned\r\nthat the facts there given concerning the deposit of Zostera marina\r\nwere not substantiated, and that Agassiz consequently did not\r\nforward the letter in its first form. The remainder of this chapter\r\nappears in this edition for the first time.--E.C.A.)\r\n\r\nAlthough so deeply interested by the geological features of the\r\ncountry, Agassiz was nevertheless drawn even more strongly to the\r\nstudy of the marine animals for which his position on the sea-coast\r\ngave him such opportunities as he had never before had. The next\r\nletter shows how fully his time was occupied, and how fascinating\r\nthis new field of observation was to him. The English is still a\r\nlittle foreign. He was not yet quite at home in the language which\r\nhe afterward wrote and spoke with such fluency.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nEAST BOSTON, September, 1847.\r\n\r\n. . .What have you thought of me all this time, not having written\r\na single line neither to you nor to Professor Silliman after the\r\nkind reception I have met with by your whole family? Pray excuse me\r\nand consider, if you please, the difficulty under which I labor,\r\nhaving every day to look after hundreds of new things which always\r\ncarry me beyond usual hours of working, when I am then so much\r\ntired that I can think of nothing. Nevertheless, it is a delightful\r\nlife to be allowed to examine in a fresh state so many things of\r\nwhich I had but an imperfect knowledge from books. The Boston\r\nmarket supplies me with more than I can examine.\r\n\r\nSince I had the pleasure of seeing you I have been very successful\r\nin collecting specimens, especially in New York and Albany. In\r\nWashington I have been delighted to see the collections of the\r\nExploring Expedition. They entitle you to the highest thanks from\r\nall scientific naturalists, and I hope it will be also felt in the\r\nsame manner by your countrymen at large. . .I long for the\r\nopportunity of studying your fossil shells. As soon as I have gone\r\nover my Lowell lectures I hope to be able to move. I shall only\r\npack up what I have already collected; but I cannot yet tell you\r\nprecisely the time.\r\n\r\nI began studying your \"Zoophytes,\" but it is so rich a book that I\r\nproceed slowly. For years I have not learned so much from a book as\r\nfrom yours. As I soon saw I would not be able to go through in a\r\nshort time, I sent a short preliminary report to one of our most\r\nwidely diffused papers, \"Preussische Staats Zeitung,\" giving only\r\nthe general impression of your work, and I shall send to Erichson a\r\nfuller scientific report after I have done with the whole volume.\r\n\r\nAs I happen to have a lithograph of the original specimen of the\r\nHomo deluvii testis of Scheuchzer, I will forward it to Professor\r\nSilliman with this letter. I expect you will find it the\r\ncounterpart of the specimen in your museum; or very nearly in the\r\nsame state of preservation.\r\n\r\nHaving just lately received my books, I also inclose a pamphlet\r\nfrom Ehrenberg, which he desired me to leave with you, and also\r\nthe books Professor Silliman has had the kindness to lend me. . .\r\nI have made many observations which I wish to publish, but I can\r\nfind no time to write them for you now. I must wait till the\r\nweather is so dull as to bring nothing into the hands of gunners\r\nand fishermen. . .\r\n\r\nSo closed his first year in America. The second unfolded events\r\nboth in the home he had left and in the one to which he had\r\nunconsciously come, which were to shape his future career, and\r\nexert the most powerful influence upon his whole life.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\n1847-1850: AGE 40-43.\r\n\r\nExcursions on Coast Survey Steamer.\r\nRelations with Dr. Bache, the Superintendent of the Coast Survey.\r\nPolitical Disturbances in Switzerland.\r\nChange of Relations with Prussia.\r\nScientific School established in Cambridge.\r\nChair of Natural History offered to Agassiz.\r\nAcceptance.\r\nRemoval to Cambridge.\r\nLiterary and Scientific Associations there and in Boston.\r\nHousehold in Cambridge.\r\nBeginning of Museum.\r\nJourney to Lake Superior.\r\n\"Report, with Narration.\"\r\n\"Principles of Zoology,\" by Agassiz and Gould.\r\nLetters from European Friends respecting these Publications.\r\nLetter from Hugh Miller.\r\nSecond Marriage.\r\nArrival of his Children in America.\r\n\r\nOne of Agassiz's great pleasures in the summer of 1847 consisted in\r\nexcursions on board the Coast Survey steamer Bibb, then employed in\r\nthe survey of the harbor and bay of Boston, under command of\r\nCaptain (afterward Admiral) Charles Henry Davis. Under no more\r\nkindly auspices could Agassiz's relations with this department of\r\ngovernment work have been begun. \"My cabin,\" writes Captain Davis,\r\nafter their first trip together, \"seems lonely without you.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto the sea-shore had been a closed book to the Swiss\r\nnaturalist, and now it opened to him a field of research almost as\r\nstimulating as his own glaciers. Born and bred among the mountains,\r\nhe knew marine animals only as they can be known in dried and\r\nalcoholic specimens, or in a fossil state. From the Bibb he writes\r\nto a friend on shore: \"I learn more here in a day than in months\r\nfrom books or dried specimens. Captain Davis is kindness itself.\r\nEverything I can wish for is at my disposal so far as it is\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bache was at this time Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and\r\nhe saw at once how the work of the naturalist might ally itself\r\nwith the professional work of the Survey to the greater usefulness\r\nof both. From the beginning to the end of his American life,\r\ntherefore, the hospitalities of the United States Coast Survey were\r\nopen to Agassiz. As a guest on board her vessels he studied the\r\nreefs of Florida and the Bahama Banks, as well as the formations of\r\nour New England shores. From the deck of the Bibb, in connection\r\nwith Count de Pourtales, his first dredging experiments were\r\nundertaken; and his last long voyage around the continent, from\r\nBoston to San Francisco, was made on board the Hassler, a Coast\r\nSurvey vessel fitted out for the Pacific shore. Here was another\r\ndetermining motive for his stay in this country. Under no other\r\ngovernment, perhaps, could he have had opportunities so invaluable\r\nto a naturalist.\r\n\r\nBut events were now passing in Europe which made his former\r\nposition there, as well as that of many of his old friends, wholly\r\nunstable. In February, 1848, the proclamation of the French\r\nrepublic broke upon Europe like a clap of thunder from a clear sky.\r\nThe news created great disturbances in Switzerland, and especially\r\nin the canton of Neuchatel, where a military force was immediately\r\norganized by the republican party in opposition to the\r\nconservatives, who would fain have continued loyal to the Prussian\r\nking. For the moment all was chaos, and the prospects of\r\ninstitutions of learning were seriously endangered. The republican\r\nparty carried the day; the canton of Neuchatel ceased to be a\r\ndependence of the Prussian monarchy, and became merged in the\r\ngeneral confederation of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time that Agassiz, in consequence of this change\r\nof conditions, was honorably discharged from the service of the\r\nPrussian king, a scientific school was organized at Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, in direct connection with Harvard University. This\r\nschool, known as the Lawrence Scientific School, owed its existence\r\nto the generosity of Abbott Lawrence, formerly United States\r\nMinister at the Court of St. James. He immediately offered the\r\nchair of Natural History (Zoology and Geology) to Agassiz, with a\r\nsalary of fifteen hundred dollars, guaranteed by Mr. Lawrence\r\nhimself, until such time as the fees of the students should be\r\nworth three thousand dollars to their professor. This time never\r\ncame. Agassiz's lectures, with the exception of the more technical\r\nones addressed to small classes, were always fully attended, but\r\nspecial students were naturally very few in a department of pure\r\nscience, and their fees never raised the salary of the professor\r\nperceptibly. This was, however, counterbalanced in some degree by\r\nthe clause in his contract which allowed him entire freedom for\r\nlectures elsewhere, so that he could supplement his restricted\r\nincome from other sources.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this new position Agassiz now removed his\r\nbachelor household to Cambridge, where he opened his first course\r\nin April, 1848. He could hardly have come to Harvard at a more\r\nauspicious moment, so far as his social and personal relations were\r\nconcerned. The college was then on a smaller scale than now, but\r\nupon its list of professors were names which would have given\r\ndistinction to any university. In letters, there were Longfellow\r\nand Lowell, and Felton, the genial Greek scholar, of whom\r\nLongfellow himself wrote, \"In Attica thy birthplace should have\r\nbeen.\" In science, there were Peirce, the mathematician, and Dr.\r\nAsa Gray, then just installed at the Botanical Garden, and Jeffries\r\nWyman, the comparative anatomist, appointed at about the same time\r\nwith Agassiz himself. To these we might almost add, as influencing\r\nthe scientific character of Harvard, Dr. Bache, the Superintendent\r\nof the Coast Survey, and Charles Henry Davis, the head of the\r\nNautical Almanac, since the kindly presence of the former was\r\nconstantly invoked as friend and counselor in the scientific\r\ndepartments, while the latter had his residence in Cambridge, and\r\nwas as intimately associated with the interests of Harvard as if he\r\nhad been officially connected with the university.\r\n\r\nA more agreeable set of men, or one more united by personal\r\nrelations and intellectual aims, it would have been difficult to\r\nfind. In connection with these names, those of Prescott, Ticknor,\r\nMotley, and Holmes also arise most naturally, for the literary men\r\nand scholars of Cambridge and Boston were closely united; and if\r\nEmerson, in his country home at Concord, was a little more\r\nwithdrawn, his influence was powerful in the intellectual life of\r\nthe whole community, and acquaintance readily grew to friendship\r\nbetween him and Agassiz. Such was the pleasant and cultivated\r\ncircle into which Agassiz was welcomed in the two cities, which\r\nbecame almost equally his home, and where the friendships he made\r\ngradually transformed exile into household life and ties.\r\n\r\nIn Cambridge he soon took his share in giving as well as receiving\r\nhospitalities, and his Saturday evenings were not the less\r\nattractive because of the foreign character and somewhat unwonted\r\ncombination of the household. Over its domestic comforts now\r\npresided an old Swiss clergyman, Monsieur Christinat. He had been\r\nattached to Agassiz from childhood, had taken the deepest interest\r\nin his whole career, and, as we have seen, had assisted him to\r\ncomplete his earlier studies. Now, under the disturbed condition of\r\nthings at home, he had thrown in his lot with him in America. \"If\r\nyour old friend,\" he writes, \"can live with his son Louis, it will\r\nbe the height of his happiness.\" To Agassiz his presence in the\r\nhouse was a benediction. He looked after the expenses, and acted as\r\ncommissary in chief to the colony. Obliged, as Agassiz was,\r\nfrequently to be absent on lecturing tours, he could, with perfect\r\nsecurity, intrust the charge of everything connected with the\r\nhousehold to his old friend, from whom he was always sure of an\r\naffectionate welcome on his return. In short, so far as an old man\r\ncould, \"papa Christinat,\" as he was universally called in this\r\nmiscellaneous family, strove to make good to him the absence of\r\nwife and children.\r\n\r\nThe make-up of the settlement was somewhat anomalous. The house,\r\nthough not large, was sufficiently roomy, and soon after Agassiz\r\nwas established there he had the pleasure of receiving under his\r\nroof certain friends and former colleagues, driven from their\r\nmoorings in Europe by the same disturbances which had prevented him\r\nfrom returning there. The arrival among them of Mr. Guyot, with\r\nwhom his personal and scientific intimacy was of such long\r\nstanding, was a great happiness. It was especially a blessing at\r\nthis time, for troubles at home weighed upon Agassiz and depressed\r\nhim. His wife, always delicate in health, had died, and although\r\nhis children were most affectionately provided for in her family\r\nand his own, they were separated from each other, as well as from\r\nhim; nor did he think it wise to bring them while so young, to\r\nAmerica. The presence, therefore, of one who was almost like a\r\nbrother in sympathy and companionship, was now more than welcome.\r\nHis original staff of co-workers and assistants still continued\r\nwith him, and there were frequent guests besides, chiefly\r\nforeigners, who, on arriving in a new country, found their first\r\nanchorage and point of departure in this little European\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe house stood in a small plot of ground, the cultivation of which\r\nwas the delight of papa Christinat. It soon became a miniature\r\nzoological garden, where all sorts of experiments in breeding and\r\nobservations on the habits of animals, were carried on. A tank for\r\nturtles and a small alligator in one corner, a large hutch for\r\nrabbits in another, a cage for eagles against the wall, a tame bear\r\nand a family of opossums, made up the menagerie, varied from time\r\nto time by new arrivals.\r\n\r\nBut Agassiz could not be long in any place without beginning to\r\nform a museum. When he accepted the chair offered him at Cambridge,\r\nthere were neither collections nor laboratories belonging to his\r\ndepartment. The specimens indispensable to his lectures were\r\ngathered almost by the day, and his outfit, with the exception of\r\nthe illustrations he had brought from Europe, consisted of a\r\nblackboard and a lecture-room. There was no money for the necessary\r\nobjects, and the want of it had to be supplied by the professor's\r\nown industry and resources. On the banks of the Charles River, just\r\nwhere it is crossed by Brighton Bridge, was an old wooden shanty\r\nset on piles; it might have served perhaps, at some time, as a\r\nbathing or a boat house. The use of this was allowed Agassiz for\r\nthe storing of such collections as he had brought together. Pine\r\nshelves nailed against the walls served for cases, and with a table\r\nor two for dissection this rough shelter was made to do duty as a\r\nkind of laboratory. The fact is worth noting, for here was the\r\nbeginning of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, now\r\nadmitted to a place among the great institutions of its kind in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1848 Agassiz organized an expedition entirely\r\nafter his own heart, inasmuch as it combined education with\r\nobservation in the field. The younger portion of the party\r\nconsisted of several of his special pupils, and a few other Harvard\r\nstudents who joined the expedition from general interest. Beside\r\nthese, there were several volunteer members, who were either\r\nnaturalists or had been attracted to the undertaking by their love\r\nof nature and travel. Their object was the examination of the\r\neastern and northern shores of Lake Superior from Sault Ste. Marie\r\nto Fort William, a region then little known to science or to\r\ntourists. Agassiz taught along the road. At evening, around the\r\ncamp-fire, or when delayed by weather or untoward circumstances, he\r\nwould give to his companions short and informal lectures, it might\r\nbe on the forest about them, or on the erratic phenomena in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood,--on the terraces of the lake shore, or on\r\nthe fish of its waters. His lecture-room, in short, was everywhere;\r\nhis apparatus a traveling blackboard and a bit of chalk; while his\r\nillustrations and specimens lay all around him, wherever the party\r\nchanced to be.\r\n\r\nTo Agassiz himself the expedition was of the deepest interest.\r\nGlacial phenomena had, as we have seen, met him at every turn since\r\nhis arrival in the United States, but nowhere had he found them in\r\ngreater distinctness than on the shores of Lake Superior. As the\r\nevidence accumulated about him, he became more than ever satisfied\r\nthat the power which had modeled and grooved the rocks all over the\r\ncountry, and clothed it with a sheet of loose material reaching to\r\nthe sea, must have been the same which had left like traces in\r\nEurope. In a continent of wide plains and unbroken surfaces, and,\r\ntherefore, with few centres of glacial action, the phenomena were\r\nmore widely and uniformly scattered than in Europe. But their\r\nspecial details, down to the closest minutiae, were the same, while\r\ntheir definite circumscription and evenness of distribution forbade\r\nthe idea of currents or floods as the moving cause. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, Agassiz recognized at once the comprehensive scope of\r\nthe phenomena. The whole history reconstructed itself in his mind,\r\nto the time when a sheet of ice clothed the land, reaching the\r\nAtlantic sea-board, as it now does the coast of Spitzbergen and the\r\nArctic shores.\r\n\r\nHe made also a careful survey of the local geology of Lake\r\nSuperior, and especially of the system of dykes, by the action of\r\nwhich he found that its bed had been excavated, and the outline of\r\nits shores determined. But perhaps the inhabitants of the lake\r\nitself occupied him even more than its conformation or its\r\nsurrounding features. Not only for its own novelty and variety, but\r\nfor its bearing on the geographical distribution of animals, the\r\nfauna of this great sheet of fresh water interested him deeply. On\r\nthis journey he saw at Niagara for the first time a living\r\ngar-pike, the only representative among modern fishes of the fossil\r\ntype of Lepidosteus. From this type he had learned more perhaps\r\nthan from any other, of the relations between the past and the\r\npresent fishes. When a student of nineteen years of age, his first\r\nsight of a stuffed skin of a gar-pike in the Museum of Carlsruhe\r\ntold him that it stood alone among living fishes. Its true alliance\r\nwith the Lepidosteus of the early geological ages became clear to\r\nhim only later in his study of the fossil fishes. He then detected\r\nthe reptilian character of the type, and saw that from the\r\narticulation of the vertebrae the head must have moved more freely\r\non the trunk than that of any fish of our days. To his great\r\ndelight, when the first living specimen of the gar-pike, or modern\r\nLepidosteus, was brought to him, it moved its head to the right and\r\nleft and upward, as a Saurian does and as no other fish can.\r\n\r\nThe result of this expedition was a valuable collection of fishes\r\nand a report upon the fauna and the geology of Lake Superior,\r\ncomprising the erratic phenomena. A narrative written by James\r\nElliot Cabot formed the introduction to the report, and it was also\r\naccompanied by two or three shorter contributions on special\r\nsubjects from other members of the party. The volume was\r\nillustrated by a number of plates exquisitely drawn and colored on\r\nstone by A. Sonrel.\r\n\r\nThis was not Agassiz's first publication in America. His\r\n\"Principles of Zoology\" (Agassiz and Gould) was published in 1848.\r\nThe book had a large sale, especially for schools. Edition followed\r\nedition, but the sale of the first part was checked by the want of\r\nthe second, which was never printed. Agassiz was always swept along\r\nso rapidly by the current of his own activity that he was sometimes\r\nforced to leave behind him unfinished work. Before the time came\r\nfor the completion of the second part of the zoology, his own\r\nknowledge had matured so much, that to be true to the facts, he\r\nmust have remodeled the whole of the first part, and for this he\r\nnever found the time. Apropos of these publications the following\r\nletters are in place.\r\n\r\nFROM SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.\r\n\r\nBELGRAVE SQUARE, October 3, 1849.\r\n\r\n. . .I thank you very sincerely for your most captivating general\r\nwork on the \"Principles of Zoology.\" I am quite in love with it. I\r\nwas glad to find that you had arranged the nummulites with the\r\ntertiary rocks, so that the broad generalization I attempted in my\r\nlast work on the Alps, Apennines, and Carpathians is completely\r\nsustained zoologically, and you will not be sorry to see the\r\nstratigraphical truth vindicated (versus E. de Beaumont and--). I\r\nbeseech you to look at my memoir, and especially at my reasoning\r\nabout the miocene and pliocene divisions of the Alps and Italy. It\r\nseems to me manifest that the percentage system derived from marine\r\nlife can never be applied to tertiary TERRESTRIAL successions. . .\r\n\r\nMy friends have congratulated me much on this my last effort, and\r\nas Lyell and others most interested in opposing me have been\r\nforward in approval, I begin to hope that I am not yet quite done\r\nup; and that unlike the Bishop of Oviedo, my last sermon \"ne sent\r\npas de l'apoplexie.\" I have, nevertheless, been desperately out of\r\nsorts and full of gout and liver and all kinds of irritation this\r\nsummer, which is the first for many a long year in which I have\r\nbeen unable to take the field. The meeting at Birmingham, however,\r\nrevived me. Professor W. Rogers will have told you all about our\r\ndoings. Buckland is up to his neck in \"sewage,\" and wishes to\r\nchange all underground London into a fossil cloaca of pseudo\r\ncoprolites. This does not quite suit the chemists charged with\r\nsanitary responsibilities; for they fear the Dean will poison half\r\nthe population in preparing his choice manures! But in this as in\r\neverything he undertakes there is a grand sweeping view.\r\n\r\nWhen are we to meet again? And when are we to have a \"stand-up\r\nfight\" on the erratics of the Alps? You will see by the abstract of\r\nmy memoir appended to my Alpine affair that I have taken the field\r\nagainst the extension of the Jura! In a word, I do not believe that\r\ngreat trunk glaciers ever filled the valleys of the Rhone, etc.\r\nPerhaps you will be present at our next meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Edinburgh, August, 1850. Olim meminisse juvabit! and\r\nthen, my dear and valued and most enlightened friend, we may study\r\nonce more together the surface of my native rocks for \"auld lang\r\nsyne.\". . .\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nDOWN, FARNBOROUGH, KENT, June 15 [1850, probably].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have seldom been more deeply gratified than by receiving your\r\nmost kind present of \"Lake Superior.\" I had heard of it, and had\r\nmuch wished to read it, but I confess it was the very great honor\r\nof having in my possession a work with your autograph, as a\r\npresentation copy, that has given me such lively and sincere\r\npleasure. I cordially thank you for it. I have begun to read it\r\nwith uncommon interest, which I see will increase as I go on.\r\n\r\nThe Cirripedia, which you and Dr. Gould were so good as to send me,\r\nhave proved of great service to me. The sessile species from\r\nMassachusetts consist of five species. . .Of the genus Balanus, on\r\nthe shores of Britain, we have ONE species (B. perforata\r\nBruguiere), which you have not in the United States, in the same\r\nway as you exclusively have B. eburneus. All the above species\r\nattain a somewhat larger average size on the shores of the United\r\nStates than on those of Britain, but the specimens from the glacial\r\nbeds of Uddevalla, Scotland, and Canada, are larger even than those\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOnce again allow me to thank you with cordiality for the pleasure\r\nyou have given me.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with the highest respect, your truly obliged,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Hugh Miller concerning Agassiz's\r\nintention of introducing \"The Footprints of the Creator\" to the\r\nAmerican public by a slight memoir of Miller is of interest here.\r\nIt is to be regretted that with this exception no letters have been\r\nfound from him among Agassiz's papers, though he must have been in\r\nfrequent correspondence with him, and they had, beside their\r\nscientific sympathy, a very cordial personal relation.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, 2 STUART STREET, May 25, 1850.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI was out of town when your kind letter reached here, and found\r\nsuch an accumulation of employment on my return that it is only now\r\nI find myself able to devote half an hour to the work of reply, and\r\nto say how thoroughly sensible I am of the honor you propose doing\r\nme. It never once crossed my mind when, in writing my little\r\nvolume, the \"Footprints,\" I had such frequent occasion to refer to\r\nmy master, our great authority in ichthyic history, that he himself\r\nwould have associated his name with it on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic, and referred in turn to its humble writer.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying parcel I send you two of my volumes, which you\r\nmay not yet have seen, and in which you may find some materials for\r\nyour proposed introductory memoir. At all events they may furnish\r\nyou with amusement in a leisure hour. The bulkier of the two,\r\n\"Scenes and Legends,\" of which a new edition has just appeared, and\r\nof which the first edition was published, after lying several years\r\nbeside me, in 1835, is the earliest of my works to which I attached\r\nmy name. It forms a sort of traditionary history of a district of\r\nScotland, about two hundred miles distant from the capital, in\r\nwhich the character of the people has been scarce at all affected\r\nby the cosmopolitanism which has been gradually modifying and\r\naltering it in the larger towns; and as it has been frequently\r\nremarked,--I know not with what degree of truth,--that there is a\r\ncloser resemblance between the Scotch and Swiss than between any\r\nother two peoples of Europe, you may have some interest in\r\ndetermining whether the features of your own country-folk are not\r\nsometimes to be seen in those of mine, as exhibited in my legendary\r\nhistory. Certainly both countries had for many ages nearly the same\r\nsort of work to do; both had to maintain a long and ultimately\r\nsuccessful war of independence against nations greatly more\r\npowerful than themselves; and as their hills produced little else\r\nthan the \"soldier and his sword,\" both had to make a trade abroad\r\nof that art of war which they were compelled in self-defense to\r\nacquire at home. Even in the laws of some nations we find them\r\ncuriously enough associated together. In France, under the old\r\nregime, the personal property of all strangers dying in the\r\ncountry, SWISS AND SCOTS EXCEPTED, was forfeited to the king.\r\n\r\nThe other volume, \"First Impressions of England and its People,\"\r\ncontains some personal anecdotes and some geology. But the\r\nnecessary materials you will chiefly find in the article from the\r\n\"North British Review\" which I also inclose. It is from the pen of\r\nSir David Brewster, with whom for the last ten years I have spent a\r\nfew very agreeable days every year at Christmas, under the roof of\r\na common friend,--one of the landed proprietors of Fifeshire. Sir\r\nDavid's estimate of the writer is, I fear, greatly too high, but\r\nhis statement of facts regarding him is correct; and I think you\r\nwill find it quite full enough for the purposes of a brief memoir.\r\nWith his article I send you one of my own, written about six years\r\nago for the same periodical, as the subject is one in which, from\r\nits connection with your master study,--the natural history of\r\nfishes,--you may take more interest than most men. It embodies,\r\nfrom observation, what may be regarded as THE NATURAL HISTORY OF\r\nTHE FISHERMAN, and describes some curious scenes and appearances\r\nwhich I witnessed many years ago when engaged, during a truant\r\nboyhood, in prosecuting the herring fishery as an amateur. Many of\r\nmy observations of natural phenomena date from this idle, and yet\r\nnot wholly wasted, period of my life.\r\n\r\nWith the volumes I send also a few casts of my less fragile\r\nspecimens of Asterolepis. Two of the number, those of the external\r\nand internal surfaces of the creature's cranial buckler, are really\r\nvery curious combinations of plates, and when viewed in a slant\r\nlight have a decidedly sculpturesque and not ungraceful effect. I\r\nhave seen on our rustic tombstones worse representations of angels,\r\nwinged and robed, than that formed by the central plates of the\r\ninterior surface when the light is made to fall along their higher\r\nprotuberances, leaving the hollows in the shade. You see how truly\r\nyour prediction regarding the flatness of the creature's head is\r\nsubstantiated by these casts; it is really not easy to know how,\r\nplaced on so flat a surface, the eyes could have been very\r\navailable save for star-gazing; but as nature makes no mistakes in\r\nsuch matters, it is possible that the creature, like the\r\nflatfishes, may have lived much at the bottom, and that most of the\r\nseeing it had use for may have been seeing in an upward direction.\r\nNone of my other specimens of bucklers are so entire and in so good\r\na state of keeping as the two from which I have taken the casts,\r\nbut they are greatly larger. One specimen, nearly complete,\r\nexhibits an area about four times as great as the largest of these\r\ntwo, and I have fragments of others which must have belonged to\r\nfish still more gigantic. The two other casts are of specimens of\r\ngill covers, which in the Asterolepis, as in the sturgeon,\r\nconsisted each of a single plate. In both the exterior surface of\r\nthe buckler and of the operculum the tubercles are a good deal\r\nenveloped in the stone, which is of a consistency too hard to be\r\nremoved without injuring what it overlies; but you will find them\r\nin the smaller cast which accompanies the others, and which, as\r\nshown by the thickness of the plate in the original, indicates\r\ntheir size and form in a large individual, very characteristically\r\nshown. So coral-like is their aspect, that if it was from such a\r\ncast, not a fossil (which would, of course, exhibit the\r\npeculiarities of the bone), that Lamarck founded his genus\r\nMonticularia, I think his apology for the error might almost be\r\nmaintained as good. I am sorry I cannot venture on taking casts\r\nfrom some of my other specimens; but they are exceedingly fragile,\r\nand as they are still without duplicates I am afraid to hazard\r\nthem. Since publishing my little volume I have got several new\r\nplates of Asterolepis,--a broad palatal plate, covered with\r\ntubercles, considerably larger than those of the creature's\r\nexternal surface,--a key-stone shaped plate, placed, when in situ,\r\nin advance of the little plate between the eyes, which form the\r\nhead and face of the effigy in the centre of the buckler,--and a\r\nside-plate, into which the condyloid processes of the lower jaw\r\nwere articulated, and which exhibited the processes on which these\r\nhinged. There are besides some two or three plates more, whose\r\nplaces I have still to find. The small cast, stained yellow, is\r\ntaken from an instructive specimen of the jaws of coccosteus, and\r\nexhibits a peculiarity which I had long suspected and referred to\r\nin the first edition of my volume on the Old Red Sandstone in\r\nrather incautious language, but which a set of my specimens now\r\nfully establishes. Each of the under jaws of the fish was furnished\r\nwith two groups of teeth: one group in the place where, in\r\nquadrupeds, we usually find the molars; and another group in the\r\nline of the symphyses. And how these both could have acted is a\r\nproblem which our anatomists here--many of whom have carefully\r\nexamined my specimen--seem unable, and in some degree, indeed,\r\nafraid to solve.\r\n\r\nI have written to the Messrs. Gould, Kendall & Lincoln to say that\r\nthe third edition of the \"Footprints\" differs from the first and\r\nsecond only by the addition of a single note and an illustrative\r\ndiagram, both of which I have inclosed to them in my communication.\r\nI anticipate much pleasure from the perusal of your work on Lake\r\nSuperior, when it comes to hand, which, as your publishers have\r\nintrusted it to the care of a gentleman visiting this country,\r\nwill, I think, be soon. It is not often that a region so remote and\r\nso little known as that which surrounds the great lake of America\r\nis visited by a naturalist of the first class. From such a terra\r\nincognita, at length unveiled to eyes so discerning, I anticipate\r\nstrange tidings.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear sir, with respect and admiration, very truly yours,\r\n\r\nHUGH MILLER.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1850 Agassiz married Elizabeth Cabot Cary,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Graves Cary, of Boston. This marriage confirmed\r\nhis resolve to remain, at least for the present, in the United\r\nStates. It connected him by the closest ties with a large family\r\ncircle, of which he was henceforth a beloved and honored member,\r\nand made him the brother-in-law of one of his most intimate friends\r\nin Cambridge, Professor C.C. Felton. Thus secure of favorable\r\nconditions for the care and education of his children, he called\r\nthem to this country. His son (then a lad of fifteen years of age)\r\nhad joined him the previous summer. His daughters, younger by\r\nseveral years than their brother, arrived the following autumn, and\r\nhome built itself up again around him.\r\n\r\nThe various foreign members of his household had already scattered.\r\nOne or two had returned to Europe, others had settled here in\r\npermanent homes of their own. Among the latter were Professor Guyot\r\nand M. de Pourtales, who remained, both as scientific colleagues\r\nand personal friends, very near and dear to him all his life. \"Papa\r\nChristinat\" had also withdrawn. While Agassiz was absent on a\r\nlecturing tour, the kind old man, knowing well the opposition he\r\nshould meet, and wishing to save both himself and his friend the\r\npain of parting, stole away without warning and went to New\r\nOrleans, where he had obtained a place as pastor. This was a great\r\ndisappointment to Agassiz, who had urged him to make his home with\r\nhim, a plan in which his wife and children cordially concurred, but\r\nwhich did not approve itself to the judgment of his old friend. M.\r\nChristinat afterward returned to Switzerland, where he ended his\r\ndays. He wrote constantly until his death, and was always kept\r\nadvised of everything that passed in the family at Cambridge. Of\r\nthe old household, Mr. Burkhardt alone remained a permanent member\r\nof the new one.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\n1850-1852: AGE 43-45.\r\n\r\nProposition from Dr. Bache.\r\nExploration of Florida Reefs.\r\nLetter to Humboldt concerning Work in America.\r\nAppointment to Professorship of Medical College in Charleston, S.C.\r\nLife at the South.\r\nViews concerning Races of Men.\r\nPrix Cuvier.\r\n\r\nTHE following letter from the Superintendent of the Coast Survey\r\ndetermined for Agassiz the chief events of the winter of 1851.\r\n\r\nFROM ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.\r\n\r\nWEBB'S HILL, October 30, 1850.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you to devote six weeks or two months to\r\nthe examination of the Florida reefs and keys in connection with\r\ntheir survey? It is extremely important to ascertain what they are\r\nand how formed. One account treats them as growing corals, another\r\nas masses of something resembling oolite, piled together,\r\nbarrier-wise. You see that this lies at the root of the progress of\r\nthe reef, so important to navigation, of the use to be made of it\r\nin placing our signals, of the use as a foundation for\r\nlight-houses, and of many other questions practically important and\r\nof high scientific interest. I would place a vessel at your\r\ndisposal during the time you were on the reef, say six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe changes at or near Cape Florida, from the Atlantic coast and\r\nits siliceous sand, to the Florida coast and its coral sand, must\r\nbe curious. You will be free to move from one end of the reef to\r\nthe other, which will be, say one hundred and fifty miles. Motion\r\nto eastward would be slow in the windy season, though favored by\r\nthe Gulf Stream as the winds are \"trade.\" Whatever collections you\r\nmight make would be your own. I would only ask for the survey such\r\ninformation and such specimens as would be valuable to its\r\noperations, especially to its hydrography, and some report on these\r\nmatters. As this will, if your time and engagements permit, lead to\r\na business arrangement, I must, though reluctantly, enter into\r\nthat. I will put aside six hundred dollars for the two months,\r\nleaving you to pay your own expenses; or, if you prefer it, will\r\npay all expenses of travel, including subsistence, to and from Key\r\nWest, and furnish vessel and subsistence while there, and four\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nWhat results would flow to science from your visit to that region!\r\nYou have spoken of the advantage of using our vessels when they\r\nwere engaged in their own work. Now I offer you a vessel the\r\nmotions of which you will control, and the assistance of the\r\nofficers and crew of which you will have. You shall be at no\r\nexpense for going and coming, or while there, and shall choose your\r\nown time. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz accepted this proposal with delight, and at once made\r\narrangements to take with him a draughtsman and an assistant, in\r\norder to give the expedition such a character as would make it\r\nuseful to science in general, as well as to the special objects of\r\nthe Coast Survey. It will be seen that Dr. Bache gladly concurred\r\nin all these views.\r\n\r\nFROM ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 18, 1850.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nOn the basis of our former communications I have been, as the time\r\nserved, raising a superstructure. I have arranged with Lieutenant\r\nCommander Alden to send the schooner W.A. Graham, belonging to the\r\nCoast Survey, under charge of an officer who will take an interest\r\nin promoting the great objects in which you will be engaged, to Key\r\nWest, in time to meet you on your arrival in the Isabel of the\r\n15th, from Charleston to Key West. The vessel will be placed at\r\nyour absolute disposal for four to six weeks, as you may find\r\ndesirable, doing just such things as you require, and going to such\r\nplaces as you direct. If you desire more than a general direction,\r\nI will give any specific ones which you may suggest. . .\r\n\r\nI have requested that room be made in the cabin for you and for two\r\naids, as you desire to take a draughtsman with you; and in\r\nreference to your enlarged plan of operating, of which I see the\r\nadvantage, I have examined the financial question, and propose to\r\nadd two hundred dollars to the six hundred in my letter of October\r\n30th, to enable you to execute it. I would suggest that you stop a\r\nday in Washington on your way to Charleston, to pick up the\r\ntopographical and geographical information which you desire, and to\r\nhave all matters of a formal kind arranged to suit your convenience\r\nand wishes, which, I am sure, will all be promotive of the objects\r\nin view from your visit to Florida. . .You say I shall smile AT\r\nyour plans,--instead of which, they have been smiled ON; now, there\r\nis a point for you,--a true Saxon distinction.\r\n\r\nIf you succeed (and did you ever fail!?) in developing for our\r\nCoast Survey the nature, structure, growth, and all that, of the\r\nFlorida reefs, you will have conferred upon the country a priceless\r\nfavor. . .\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of the Coast Survey never had cause to regret\r\nthe carte-blanche he had thus given. A few weeks, with the\r\nfacilities so liberally afforded, gave Agassiz a clew to all the\r\nphenomena he had been commissioned to examine, and enabled him to\r\nexplain the relation between the keys and the outer and inner\r\nreefs, and the mud swamps, or more open channels, dividing them,\r\nand to connect these again with the hummocks and everglades of the\r\nmain-land. It remains to be seen whether his theory will hold good,\r\nthat the whole or the greater part of the Florida peninsula has,\r\nlike its southern portion, been built up of concentric reefs. But\r\nhis explanation of the present reefs, their structure, laws of\r\ngrowth, relations to each other and to the main-land, as well as to\r\nthe Gulf Stream and its prevailing currents, was of great practical\r\nservice to the Coast Survey. It was especially valuable in\r\ndetermining how far the soil now building up from accumulations of\r\nmud and coral debris was likely to remain for a long time shifting\r\nand uncertain, and how far and in what localities it might be\r\nrelied upon as affording a stable foundation. When, at the meeting\r\nof the American Association in the following spring, Agassiz gave\r\nan account of his late exploration, Dr. Bache, who was present,\r\nsaid that for the first time he understood the bearing of the whole\r\nsubject, though he had so long been trying to unravel it.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written immediately after Agassiz's\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nTO SIR CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 26, 1851.\r\n\r\n. . .I have spent a large part of the winter in Florida, with a\r\nview of studying the coral reefs. I have found that they constitute\r\na new class of reefs, distinct from those described by Darwin and\r\nDana under the name of fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. I\r\nhave lately read a paper upon that subject before the American\r\nAcademy, which I shall send you as soon as it is printed. The case\r\nis this. There are several concentric reefs separated by deep\r\nchannels; the peninsula of Florida itself is a succession of such\r\nreefs, the everglades being the filled-up channels, while the\r\nhummocks were formerly little intervening islands, like the\r\nmangrove islands in the present channels. But what is quite\r\nremarkable, all these concentric reefs are upon one level, above\r\nthat of the sea, and there is no indication whatever of upheaval.\r\nYou will find some observations upon upheavals, etc., in Silliman,\r\nby Tuomey; it is a great mistake, as I shall show. The Tortugas are\r\na real atoll, but formed without the remotest indication of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nOf course this does not interfere in the least with the views of\r\nDarwin, for the whole ground presents peculiar features. I wish you\r\nwould tell him something about this. One of the most remarkable\r\npeculiarities of the rocks in the reefs of the Tortugas consists in\r\ntheir composition; they are chiefly made up of CORALLINES,\r\nlimestone algae, and, to a small extent only, of real corals. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz's report to the Coast Survey upon the results of this first\r\ninvestigation made by him upon the reefs of Florida was not\r\npublished in full at the time. The parts practically most important\r\nto the Coast Survey were incorporated in their subsequent charts;\r\nthe more general scientific results, as touching the physical\r\nhistory of the peninsula as a whole, appeared in various forms,\r\nwere embodied in Agassiz's lectures, and were printed some years\r\nafter in his volume entitled \"Methods of Study.\" The original\r\nreport, with all the plates prepared for it, was published in the\r\n\"Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology,\" under the\r\nsupervision of Alexander Agassiz, after the death of his father. It\r\nforms a quarto volume, containing some sixty pages of text, with\r\ntwenty-two plates, illustrative of corals and coral structure, and\r\na map of Southern Florida with its reefs and keys.\r\n\r\nThis expedition was also of great importance to Agassiz's\r\ncollections, and to the embryo museum in Cambridge. It laid the\r\nfoundation of a very complete collection of corals of all varieties\r\nand in all stages of growth. All the specimens, from huge coral\r\nheads and branching fans down to the most minute single corals,\r\nwere given up to him, the value of the whole being greatly enhanced\r\nby the drawings taken on the spot from the living animals.\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs also the following fragment of a letter to\r\nHumboldt.\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n[Probably 1852,--date not given.]\r\n\r\n. . .What a time has passed since my last letter! Had you not been\r\nconstantly in my thoughts, and your counsels always before me as my\r\nguide, I should reproach myself for my silence. I hope my two\r\npapers on the medusae, forwarded this year, have reached you, and\r\nalso one upon the classification of insects, as based upon their\r\ndevelopment. I have devoted myself especially to the organization\r\nof the invertebrate animals, and to the facts bearing upon the\r\nperfecting of their classification. I have succeeded in tracing the\r\nsame identity of structure between the three classes of radiates,\r\nand also between those of mollusks, as has already been recognized\r\nin the vertebrates, and partially in the articulates. It is truly a\r\npleasure for me now to be able to demonstrate in my lectures the\r\ninsensible gradations existing between polyps, medusae, and\r\nechinoderms, and to designate by the same name organs seemingly so\r\ndifferent. Especially has the minute examination of the thickness\r\nof the test in echinoderms revealed to me unexpected relations\r\nbetween the sea-urchin and the medusa. No one suspects, I fancy, at\r\nthis moment, that the solid envelope of the Scutellae and the\r\nClypeasters is traversed by a net-work of radiating tubes,\r\ncorresponding to those of the medusae, so well presented by\r\nEhrenberg in Aurelia aurita. If the Berlin zoologists will take the\r\ntrouble to file off the surface of the test of an Echinarachnius\r\nparma, they will find a circular canal as large and as continuous\r\nas that of the medusae. The aquiferous tubes specified above open\r\ninto this canal. But the same thing may be found under various\r\nmodifications in other genera of the family. Since I have succeeded\r\nin injecting colored liquid into the beroids, for instance, and\r\nkeeping them alive with it circulating in their transparent mass, I\r\nam able to show the identity of their zones of locomotive fringes\r\n(combs), from which they take their name of Ctenophorae, with the\r\nambulacral (locomotive) apparatus of the echinoderms. Furnished\r\nwith these facts, it is not difficult to recognize true beroidal\r\nforms in the embryos of sea-urchins and star-fishes, published by\r\nMuller in his beautiful plates, and thus to trace the medusoid\r\norigin of the echinoderms, as the polypoid origin of the medusae\r\nhas already been recognized. I do not here allude to their\r\nprimitive origin, but simply to the general fact that among\r\nradiates the embryos of the higher classes represent, in miniature,\r\ntypes of the lower classes, as, for instance, those of the\r\nechinoderms resemble the medusae, those of the medusae the polyps.\r\nHaving passed the greater part of last winter in Florida, where I\r\nwas especially occupied in studying the coral reefs, I had the best\r\nopportunity in the world for prosecuting my embryological\r\nresearches upon the stony corals. I detected relations among them\r\nwhich now enable me to determine the classification of these\r\nanimals according to their mode of development with greater\r\ncompleteness than ever before, and even to assign a superior or\r\ninferior rank to their different types, agreeing with their\r\ngeological succession, as I have already done for the fishes. I am\r\non the road to the same results for the mollusks and the\r\narticulates, and can even now say in general terms, that the most\r\nancient representatives of all the families belonging to these\r\ngreat groups, strikingly recall the first phases in the embryonic\r\ndevelopment of their successors in more recent formations, and even\r\nthat the embryos of comparatively recent families recall families\r\nbelonging to ancient epochs. You will find some allusion to these\r\nresults in my Lectures on Embryology, given in my \"Lake Superior,\"\r\nof which I have twice sent you a copy, that it might reach you the\r\nmore surely; but these first impressions have assumed greater\r\ncoherence now, and I constantly find myself recurring to my fossils\r\nfor light upon the embryonic forms I am studying and vice versa,\r\nconsulting my embryological drawings in order to decipher the\r\nfossils with greater certainty.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the sea and the ease with which I can visit any\r\npart of the coast within a range of some twenty degrees give me\r\ninexhaustible resources for the whole year, which, as time goes on,\r\nI turn more and more to the best account. On the other hand, the\r\nabundance and admirable state of preservation of the fossils found\r\nin our ancient deposits, as well as the regular succession of the\r\nbeds containing them, contribute admirable material for this kind\r\nof comparative study. . .\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 Agassiz was invited to a professorship at the\r\nMedical College in Charleston, S.C. This was especially acceptable\r\nto him, because it substituted a regular course of instruction to\r\nstudents, for the disconnected lectures given to miscellaneous\r\naudiences, in various parts of the country, by which he was obliged\r\nto eke out his small salary and provide for his scientific\r\nexpenses. While more fatiguing than class-room work, these\r\nscattered lectures had a less educational value, though, on the\r\nother hand, they awakened a very wide-spread interest in the study\r\nof nature. The strain of constant traveling for this purpose, the\r\nmore harassing because so unfavorable to his habits of continuous\r\nwork, had already told severely upon his health; and from this\r\npoint of view also the new professorship was attractive, as\r\npromising a more quiet, though no less occupied, life. The lectures\r\nwere to be given during the three winter months, thus occupying the\r\ninterval between his autumn and spring courses at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nHe assumed his new duties at Charleston in December, 1851, and by\r\nthe kindness of his friend Mrs. Rutledge, who offered him the use\r\nof her cottage for the purpose, he soon established a laboratory on\r\nSullivan's Island, where the two or three assistants he had brought\r\nwith him could work conveniently. The cottage stood within hearing\r\nof the wash of the waves, at the head of the long, hard sand beach\r\nwhich fringed the island shore for some three or four miles. There\r\ncould hardly be a more favorable position for a naturalist, and\r\nthere, in the midst of their specimens, Agassiz and his band of\r\nworkers might constantly be found. His studies here were of the\r\ngreater interest to him because they connected themselves with his\r\nprevious researches, not only upon the fishes, but also upon the\r\nlower marine animals of the coast of New England and of the Florida\r\nreefs; so that he had now a basis for comparison of the fauna\r\nscattered along the whole Atlantic coast of the United States. The\r\nfollowing letter gives some idea of his work at this time.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nCHARLESTON, January 26, 1852.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nYou should at least know that I think of you often on these shores.\r\nAnd how could I do otherwise when I daily find new small crustacea,\r\nwhich remind me of the important work you are now preparing on that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOf course, of the larger ones there is nothing to be found after\r\nProfessor Gibbes has gone over the ground, but among the lower\r\norders there are a great many in store for a microscopic observer.\r\nI have only to regret that I cannot apply myself more steadily. I\r\nfind my nervous system so over-excited that any continuous exertion\r\nmakes me feverish. So I go about as much as the weather allows, and\r\ngather materials for better times.\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting medusae have been already observed; among\r\nothers, the entire metamorphosis and alternate generation of a new\r\nspecies of my genus tiaropsis. You will be pleased to know that\r\nhere, as well as at the North, tiaropsis is the medusa of a\r\ncampanularia. Mr. Clark, one of my assistants, has made very good\r\ndrawings of all its stages of growth, and of various other hydroid\r\nmedusae peculiar to this coast. Mr. Stimpson, another very\r\npromising young naturalist, who has been connected with me for some\r\ntime in the same capacity, draws the crustacea and bryozoa, of\r\nwhich there are also a good many new ones here. My son and my old\r\nfriend Burkhardt are also with me (upon Sullivan's Island), and\r\nthey look after the larger species, so that I shall probably have\r\ngreatly increased my information upon the fauna of the Atlantic\r\ncoast by the time I return to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIn town, where I go three times a week to deliver lectures at the\r\nMedical College (beside a course just now in the evening also\r\nbefore a mixed audience), I have the rest of my family, so that\r\nnothing would be wanting to my happiness if my health were only\r\nbetter. . .What a pity that a man cannot work as much as he would\r\nlike; or at least accomplish what he aims at. But no doubt it is\r\nbest it should be so; there is no harm in being compelled by\r\nnatural necessities to limit our ambition,--on the contrary, the\r\nbetter sides of our nature are thus not allowed to go to sleep.\r\nHowever, I cannot but regret that I am unable at this time to trace\r\nmore extensively subjects for which I should have ample\r\nopportunities here, as for instance the anatomy of the echinoderms,\r\nand also the embryology of the lower animals in general. . .\r\n\r\nThis winter, notwithstanding the limitations imposed upon his work\r\nby the state of his health, was a very happy one to Agassiz. As\r\nmentioned in the above letter his wife and daughters had\r\naccompanied him to Charleston, and were established there in\r\nlodgings. Their holidays and occasional vacations were passed at\r\nthe house of Dr. John E. Holbrook (the \"Hollow Tree\"), an\r\nexquisitely pretty and picturesque country place in the\r\nneighborhood of Charleston. Here Agassiz had been received almost\r\nas one of the family on his first visit to Charleston, shortly\r\nafter his arrival in the United States. Dr. Holbrook's name, as the\r\nauthor of the \"Herpetology of South Carolina,\" had long been\r\nfamiliar to him, and he now found a congenial and affectionate\r\nfriend in the colleague and fellow-worker, whose personal\r\nacquaintance he had been anxious to make. Dr. Holbrook's wife, a\r\ndirect descendant of John Rutledge of our revolutionary history,\r\nnot only shared her husband's intellectual life, but had herself\r\nrare mental qualities, which had been developed by an unusually\r\ncomplete and efficient education. The wide and various range of her\r\nreading, the accuracy of her knowledge in matters of history and\r\nliterature, and the charm of her conversation, made her a\r\ndelightful companion. She exercised the most beneficent influence\r\nupon her large circle of young people, and without any effort to\r\nattract, she drew to herself whatever was most bright and clever in\r\nthe society about her. The \"Hollow Tree,\" presided over by its\r\nhospitable host and hostess was, therefore, the centre of a\r\nstimulating and cultivated social intercourse, free from all gene\r\nor formality. Here Agassiz and his family spent many happy days\r\nduring their southern sojourn of 1852. The woods were yellow with\r\njessamine, and the low, deep piazza was shut in by vines and roses;\r\nthe open windows and the soft air full of sweet, out-of-door\r\nfragrance made one forget, spite of the wood fire on the hearth,\r\nthat it was winter by the calendar. The days, passed almost wholly\r\nin the woods or on the veranda, closed with evenings spent not\r\ninfrequently in discussions upon the scientific ideas and theories\r\nof the day, carried often beyond the region of demonstrated facts\r\ninto that of speculative thought. An ever-recurring topic was that\r\nof the origin of the human race. It was Agassiz's declared belief\r\nthat man had sprung not from a common stock, but from various\r\ncentres, and that the original circumscription of these primordial\r\ngroups of the human family corresponded in a large and general way\r\nwith the distribution of animals and their combination into faunae.\r\n* (* See \"Sketch of the Natural Provinces of the Animal World and\r\ntheir Relation to the Different Types of Man\" included in Nott &\r\nGliddon's \"Types of Mankind\".) His special zoological studies were\r\ntoo engrossing to allow him to follow this line of investigation\r\nclosely, but it was never absent from his view of the animal\r\nkingdom as a whole. He valued extremely Mrs. Holbrook's thoughtful\r\nsympathy, and as the following letter connects itself with the\r\nwinter evening talks by the \"Hollow Tree\" fireside, and was\r\nsuggested by them, it may be given here, though in date it is a\r\nlittle in advance of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. HOLBROOK.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July, 1852.\r\n\r\n. . .I am again working at the human races, and have opened another\r\nline of investigation in that direction. The method followed by\r\nformer investigators does not seem to me to have been altogether\r\nthe best, since there is so little agreement between them. The\r\ndifficulty has, no doubt, arisen on one side from the circumstance\r\nthat the inquirer sought for evidence of the unity of all races,\r\nexpecting the result to agree with the prevailing interpretation of\r\nGenesis; and on the other from too zoological a point of view in\r\nweighing the differences observed. Again, both have almost set\r\naside all evidence not directly derived from the examination of the\r\nraces themselves. It has occurred to me that as a preliminary\r\ninquiry we ought to consider the propriety of applying to man the\r\nsame rules as to animals, examining the limits within which they\r\nobtain, and paying due attention to all circumstances bearing upon\r\nthe differences observed among men, from whatever quarter in the\r\nstudy of nature they may be gathered. What do the monkeys say to\r\nthis? or, rather, what have they to tell in reference to it? There\r\nare among them as great, and, indeed, even greater, differences\r\nthan among men, for they are acknowledged to constitute different\r\ngenera, and are referred to many, indeed to more than a hundred,\r\nspecies; but they are the nearest approach to the human family, and\r\nwe may at least derive some hints from them. How much mixture there\r\nis among these species, if any, is not at all ascertained; indeed,\r\nwe have not the least information respecting their intercourse; but\r\none point is certain,--zoologists agree as little among themselves\r\nrespecting the limits of these species as they do respecting the\r\naffinities of the races of men. What some consider as distinct\r\nspecies, others consider as mere varieties, and these varieties or\r\nspecies differ in particulars neither more constant nor more\r\nimportant than those which distinguish the human races. The fact\r\nthat they are arranged in different genera, species, and varieties\r\ndoes not lessen the value of the comparison; for the point in\r\nquestion is just to know whether nations, races, and what have also\r\nbeen called families of men, such as the Indo-Germanic, the\r\nSemitic, etc., do not in reality correspond to the families,\r\ngenera, and species of monkeys. Now the first great subdivisions\r\namong the true monkeys (excluding Makis and Arctopitheci) are\r\nfounded upon the form of the nose, those of the new world having a\r\nbroad partition between the nostrils, while those of the old world\r\nhave it narrow. How curious that this fact, which has been known to\r\nnaturalists for half a century, as presenting a leading feature\r\namong monkeys, should have been overlooked in man, when, in\r\nreality, the negroes and Australians differ in precisely the same\r\nmanner from the other races; they having a broad partition, and\r\nnostrils opening sideways, like the monkeys of South America, while\r\nthe other types of the human family have a narrow partition and\r\nnostrils opening downward, like the monkeys of Asia and Africa.\r\nAgain, the minor differences, such as the obliquity of the anterior\r\nteeth, the thickness of the lips, the projection of the\r\ncheek-bones, the position of the eyes, the characteristic hair, or\r\nwool, afford as constant differences as those by which the\r\nchimpanzees, orangs, and gibbons are separated into distinct\r\ngenera; and their respective species differ no more than do the\r\nGreeks, Germans, and Arabs,--or the Chinese, Tartars, and Finns,\r\n--or the New Zealanders and Malays, which are respectively referred\r\nto the same race. The truth is, that the different SPECIES admitted\r\nby some among the orangs are in reality RACES among monkeys, or\r\nelse the races among men are nothing more than what are called\r\nspecies among certain monkeys. . .Listen for a moment to the\r\nfollowing facts, and when you read this place a map of the world\r\nbefore you. Upon a narrow strip of land along the Gulf of Guinea,\r\nfrom Cape Palmas to the Gaboon, live two so-called species of\r\nchimpanzee; upon the islands of Sumatra and Borneo live three or\r\nfour orangs; upon the shores of the Gulf of Bengal, including the\r\nneighborhood of Calcutta, Burmah, Malacca, Sumatra, Borneo, and\r\nJava together, ten or eleven species of gibbons, all of which are\r\nthe nearest relatives to the human family, some being as large as\r\ncertain races of men; altogether, fifteen species of anthropoid\r\nmonkeys playing their part in the animal population of the world\r\nupon an area not equaling by any means the surface of Europe. Some\r\nof these species are limited to Borneo, others to Sumatra, others\r\nto Java alone, others to the peninsula of Malacca; that is to say\r\nto tracts of land similar in extent to Spain, France, Italy, and\r\neven to Ireland; distinct animals, considered by most naturalists\r\nas distinct species, approaching man most closely in structural\r\neminence and size, limited to areas not larger than Spain or Italy.\r\nWhy, then, should not the primitive theatre of a nation of men have\r\nbeen circumscribed within similar boundaries, and from the\r\nbeginning have been as independent as the chimpanzee of Guinea, or\r\nthe orangs of Borneo and Sumatra? Of course, the superior powers of\r\nman have enabled him to undertake migrations, but how limited are\r\nthese, and how slight the traces they have left behind them. . .\r\nUnfortunately for natural history, history so-called has recorded\r\nmore faithfully the doings of handfuls of adventurers than the real\r\nhistory of the primitive nations with whom the migrating tribes\r\ncame into contact. But I hope it will yet be possible to dive under\r\nthese waves of migration, to remove, as it were, the trace of their\r\npassage, and to read the true history of the past inhabitants of\r\nthe different parts of the world, when it will be found, if all\r\nanalogies are not deceptive, that every country equaling in extent\r\nthose within the limits of which distinct nationalities are known\r\nto have played their part in history, has had its distinct\r\naborigines, the character of which it is now the duty of\r\nnaturalists to restore, if it be not too late, in the same manner\r\nas paleontologists restore fossil remains. I have already made some\r\nattempts, by studying ancient geography, and I hope the task may\r\nyet be accomplished. . .Look, for instance, at Spain. The Iberians\r\nare known as the first inhabitants, never extending much beyond the\r\nPyrenees to the Garonne, and along the gulfs of Lyons and Genoa. As\r\nearly as during the period of Phoenician prosperity they raised\r\nwool from their native sheep, derived from the Mouflon, still found\r\nwild in Spain, Corsica, and Sardinia; they had a peculiar breed of\r\nhorses, to this day differing from all other horses in the world.\r\nIs this not better evidence of their independent origin, than is\r\nthe fancied lineage with the Indo-Germanic family of their Oriental\r\ndescent? For we must not forget, in connection with this, that the\r\nBasque language was once the language of all Spain, that which the\r\nIberian spoke, and which has no direct relation to Sanskrit.\r\n\r\nI have alluded but slightly to the negro race, and not at all to\r\nthe Indians. I would only add with reference to these that I begin\r\nto perceive the possibility of distinguishing different centres of\r\ngrowth in these two continents. If we leave out of consideration\r\nfancied migrations, what connection can be traced, for instance,\r\nbetween the Eskimos, along the whole northern districts of this\r\ncontinent, and the Indians of the United States, those of Mexico,\r\nthose of Peru, and those of Brazil? Is there any real connection\r\nbetween the coast tribes of the northwest coast, the mound\r\nbuilders, the Aztec civilization, the Inca, and the Gueranis? It\r\nseems to me no more than between the Assyrian and Egyptian\r\ncivilization. And as to negroes, there is, perhaps, a still greater\r\ndifference between those of Senegal, of Guinea, and the Caffres and\r\nHottentots, when compared with the Gallahs and Mandingoes. But\r\nwhere is the time to be taken for the necessary investigations\r\ninvolved in these inquiries? Pray write to me soon what you say to\r\nall this, and believe me always your true friend,\r\n\r\nL. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1852, while still in Charleston, Agassiz heard\r\nthat the Prix Cuvier, now given for the first time, was awarded to\r\nhim for the \"Poissons Fossiles.\" This gratified him the more\r\nbecause the work had been so directly bequeathed to him by Cuvier\r\nhimself. To his mother, through whom he received the news in\r\nadvance of the official papers, it also gave great pleasure. \"Your\r\nfossil fishes,\" she says, \"which have cost you so much anxiety, so\r\nmuch toil, so many sacrifices, have now been estimated at their\r\ntrue value by the most eminent judges. . .This has given me such\r\nhappiness, dear Louis, that the tears are in my eyes as I write it\r\nto you.\" She had followed the difficulties of his task too closely\r\nnot to share also its success.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\n1852-1855: AGE 45-48.\r\n\r\nReturn to Cambridge.\r\nAnxiety about Collections.\r\nPurchase of Collections.\r\nSecond Winter in Charleston.\r\nIllness.\r\nLetter to James D.

By this time he had become intimate with\r\nProfessor Henry, at whose hospitable house he and his family were\r\nstaying during their visit at Washington. He had the warmest\r\nsympathy not only with Professor Henry's scientific work and\r\ncharacter, but also with his views regarding the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, of which he had become the Superintendent shortly\r\nafter Agassiz arrived in this country. Agassiz himself was soon\r\nappointed one of the Regents of the Institution and remained upon\r\nthe Board until his death.\r\n\r\nAgassiz now began to feel an increased anxiety about his\r\ncollections. During the six years of his stay in the United States\r\nhe had explored the whole Atlantic sea-board as well as the lake\r\nand river system of the Eastern and Middle States, and had amassed\r\nsuch materials in natural history as already gave his collections,\r\nin certain departments at least, a marked importance. In the lower\r\nanimals, and as illustrating the embryology of the marine\r\ninvertebrates, they were especially valuable. It had long been a\r\nfavorite idea with him to build up an embryological department in\r\nhis prospective museum; the more so because such a provision on any\r\nlarge scale had never been included in the plan of the great\r\nzoological institutions, and he believed it would have a direct and\r\npowerful influence on the progress of modern science. The\r\ncollections now in his possession included ample means for this\r\nkind of research, beside a fair representation of almost all\r\nclasses of the animal kingdom. Packed together, however, in the\r\nnarrowest quarters, they were hardly within his own reach, much\r\nless could they be made available for others. His own resources\r\nwere strained to the utmost, merely to save these precious\r\nmaterials from destruction. It is true that in 1850 the sum of four\r\nhundred dollars, to be renewed annually, was allowed him by the\r\nUniversity for their preservation, and a barrack-like wooden\r\nbuilding on the college grounds, far preferable to the bath-house\r\nby the river, was provided for their storage. But the cost of\r\nkeeping them was counted by thousands, not by hundreds, and the\r\ngreater part of what Agassiz could make by his lectures outside of\r\nCambridge was swallowed up in this way. It was, perhaps, the\r\nknowledge of this which induced certain friends, interested in him\r\nand in science, to subscribe twelve thousand dollars for the\r\npurchase of his collections, to be thus permanently secured to\r\nCambridge. This gave him back, in part, the sum he had already\r\nspent upon them, and which he was more than ready to spend again in\r\ntheir maintenance and increase.\r\n\r\nThe next year showed that his over-burdened life was beginning to\r\ntell upon his health. Scarcely had he arrived in Charleston and\r\nbegun his course at the Medical College when he was attacked by a\r\nviolent fever, and his life was in danger for many days.\r\nFortunately for him his illness occurred at the \"Hollow Tree,\"\r\nwhere he was passing the Christmas holidays. Dr. and Mrs. Holbrook\r\nwere like a brother and sister to him, and nothing could exceed the\r\nkindness he received under their roof. One young friend who had\r\nbeen his pupil, and to whom he was much attached, Dr. St. Julian\r\nRavenel, was constantly at his bedside. His care was invaluable,\r\nfor he combined the qualities of physician and nurse. Under such\r\nwatchful tending, Agassiz could hardly fail to mend if cure were\r\nhumanly possible. The solicitude of these nearer friends seemed to\r\nbe shared by the whole community, and his recovery gave general\r\nrelief. He was able to resume his lectures toward the end of\r\nFebruary. Spite of the languor of convalescence his elastic mind\r\nwas at once ready for work, as may be seen by the following extract\r\nfrom one of his first letters.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nSULLIVAN'S ISLAND, CHARLESTON, February 16, 1853.\r\n\r\n. . .It seems, indeed, to me as if in the study of the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals the present condition of the animal kingdom\r\nwas too exclusively taken into consideration. Whenever it can be\r\ndone, and I hope before long it may be done for all classes, it\r\nwill be desirable to take into account the relations of the living\r\nto the fossil species. Since you are as fully satisfied as I am\r\nthat the location of animals, with all their peculiarities, is not\r\nthe result of physical influences, but lies within the plans and\r\nintentions of the Creator, it must be obvious that the successive\r\nintroduction of all the diversity of forms which have existed from\r\nthe first appearance of any given division of the animal kingdom up\r\nto the present creation, must have reference to the location of\r\nthose now in existence. For instance, if it be true among mammalia\r\nthat the highest types, such as quadrumana, are essentially\r\ntropical, may it not be that the prevailing distribution of the\r\ninferior pachyderms within the same geographical limits is owing to\r\nthe circumstance that their type was introduced upon earth during a\r\nwarmer period in the history of our globe, and that their present\r\nlocation is in accordance with that fact, rather than related to\r\ntheir degree of organization? The pentacrinites, the lowest of the\r\nechinoderms, have only one living representative in tropical\r\nAmerica, where we find at the same time the highest and largest\r\nspatangi and holothuridae. Is this not quite a parallel case with\r\nthe monkeys and pachyderms? for once crinoids were the only\r\nrepresentatives of the class of echinoderms. May we not say the\r\nsame of crocodiles when compared with the ancient gigantic\r\nsaurians? or are the crocodiles, as an order, distinct from the\r\nother saurians, and really higher than the turtles? Innumerable\r\nquestions of this kind, of great importance for zoology, are\r\nsuggested at every step, as soon as we compare the present\r\ndistribution of animals with that of the inhabitants of former\r\ngeological periods. Among crustacea, it is very remarkable that\r\ntrilobites and limulus-like forms are the only representatives of\r\nthe class during the paleozoic ages; that macrourans prevailed in\r\nthe same manner during the secondary period; and that brachyurans\r\nmake their appearance only in the tertiary period. Do you discover\r\nin your results any connection between such facts and the present\r\ndistribution of crustacea? There is certainly one feature in their\r\nclassification which must appear very striking,--that, taken on a\r\nlarge scale, the organic rank of these animals agrees in the main\r\nwith their order of succession in geological times; and this fact\r\nis of no small importance when it is found that the same\r\ncorrespondence between rank and succession obtains through all\r\nclasses of the animal kingdom, and that similar features are\r\ndisplayed in the embryonic growth of all types so far as now known.\r\n\r\nBut I feel my head is growing dull, and I will stop here. Let me\r\nconclude by congratulating you on having completed your great work\r\non crustacea. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz returned to the North in the spring of 1853 by way of the\r\nMississippi, stopping to lecture at Mobile, New Orleans, and St.\r\nLouis. On leaving Charleston he proffered his resignation with deep\r\nregret, for, beside the close personal ties he had formed, he was\r\nattached to the place, the people, and to his work there. He had\r\nhoped to establish a permanent station for sustained observations\r\nin South Carolina, and thus to carry on a series of researches\r\nwhich, taken in connection with his studies on the New England\r\ncoast and its vicinity, and on the Florida reefs and shores, would\r\nafford a wide field of comparison. This was not to be, however. The\r\nMedical College refused, indeed, to accept his resignation,\r\ngranting him, at the same time, a year of absence. But it soon\r\nbecame evident that his health was seriously shaken, and that he\r\nneeded the tonic of the northern winter. He was, indeed, never\r\nafterward as strong as he had been before this illness.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1854 was passed in Cambridge with such quiet and rest\r\nas the conditions of his life would allow. In May of that year he\r\nreceived an invitation to the recently established University of\r\nZurich, in Switzerland. His acceptance was urged upon the ground of\r\npatriotism as well as on that of a liberal endowment both for the\r\nprofessor, and for the museum of which he was to have charge. The\r\noffer was tempting, but Agassiz was in love (the word is not too\r\nstrong) with the work he had undertaken and the hopes he had formed\r\nin America. He believed that by his own efforts, combined with the\r\nenthusiasm for science which he had aroused and constantly strove\r\nto keep alive and foster in the community, he should at last\r\nsucceed in founding a museum after his own heart in the United\r\nStates,--a museum which should not be a mere accumulation, however\r\nvast or extensive, of objects of natural history, but should have a\r\nwell-combined and clearly expressed educational value. As we shall\r\nsee, neither the associations of his early life nor the most\r\ntempting scientific prizes in the gift of the old world could\r\ndivert him from this settled purpose. The proposition from Zurich\r\nwas not official, but came through a friend and colleague, for whom\r\nhe had the deepest sympathy and admiration,--Oswald Heer. To work\r\nin his immediate neighborhood would have been in itself a\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR OSWALD HEER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 9, 1855.\r\n\r\nMY HONORED FRIEND,\r\n\r\nHow shall I make you understand why your kind letter, though it\r\nreached me some months ago, has remained till now unanswered. It\r\nconcerns a decision of vital importance to my whole life, and in\r\nsuch a case one must not decide hastily, nor even with too\r\nexclusive regard for one's own preference in the matter. You cannot\r\ndoubt that the thought of joining an institution of my native\r\ncountry, and thus helping to stimulate scientific progress in the\r\nland of my birth, my home, and my early friends, appeals to all I\r\nhold dear and honorable in life. On the other side I have now been\r\neight years in America, have learned to understand the advantages\r\nof my position here, and have begun undertakings which are not yet\r\nbrought to a conclusion. I am aware also how wide an influence I\r\nalready exert upon this land of the future,--an influence which\r\ngains in extent and intensity with every year,--so that it becomes\r\nvery difficult for me to discern clearly where I can be most useful\r\nto science. Among my privileges I must not overlook that of passing\r\nmuch of my time on the immediate sea-shore, where the resources for\r\nthe zoologist and embryologist are inexhaustible. I have now a\r\nhouse distant only a few steps from an admirable locality for these\r\nstudies, and can therefore pursue them uninterruptedly throughout\r\nthe whole year, instead of being limited, like most naturalists, to\r\nthe short summer vacations. It is true I miss the larger museums,\r\nlibraries, etc., as well as the stimulus to be derived from\r\nassociation with a number of like-minded co-workers, all striving\r\ntoward the same end. With every year, however, the number of able\r\nand influential investigators increases here, and among them are\r\nsome who might justly claim a prominent place anywhere. . .\r\n\r\nNeither are means for publication lacking. The larger treatises\r\nwith costly illustrations appear in the Smithsonian Contributions,\r\nin the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, in those\r\nof the Academy of Natural Sciences, and in the Memoirs of the\r\nAmerican Academy; while the smaller communications find a place in\r\nSilliman's Journal, in the Journal of the Boston Natural History\r\nSociety, and in the proceedings of other scientific societies.\r\nMuseums also are already founded;. . .and beside these there are a\r\nnumber of private collections in single departments of zoology. . .\r\nBetter than all this, however, is the lively and general interest\r\ntaken in the exploration of the country itself. Every scientific\r\nexpedition sent out by the government to the interior, or to the\r\nWestern States of Oregon and California, is accompanied by a\r\nscientific commission,--zoologists, geologists, and botanists. By\r\nthis means magnificent collections, awaiting only able\r\ninvestigators to work them up, have been brought together. Indeed,\r\nI do not believe that as many new things are accumulated anywhere\r\nas just here, and it is my hope to contribute hereafter to the more\r\ncritical and careful examination of these treasures. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have asked myself for months past how I ought to\r\ndecide; not what were my inclinations, for that is not the\r\nquestion,--but what was my duty toward science? After the most\r\ncareful consideration I am no longer in doubt, and though it\r\ngrieves me to do so, I write to beg that you will withdraw from any\r\naction which might bring me a direct call to the professorship in\r\nZurich. I have decided to remain here for an indefinite time, under\r\nthe conviction that I shall exert a more advantageous and more\r\nextensive influence on the progress of science in this country than\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nI regret that I cannot accept your offer of the Oeningen fossils.\r\nIn the last two years I have spent more than 20,000 francs on my\r\ncollection, and must not incur any farther expense of that kind at\r\npresent. As soon, however, as I have new means at my command such a\r\ncollection would be most welcome, and should it remain in your\r\nhands I may be very glad to take it. Neither can I make any\r\nexchange of duplicates just now, as I have not yet been able to\r\nsort my collections and set aside the specimens which may be\r\nconsidered only as materials for exchange. Can you procure for me\r\nGlarus fishes in any considerable number? I should like to purchase\r\nthem for my collection, and do not care for single specimens of\r\nevery species, but would prefer whole suites that I may revise my\r\nformer identifications in the light of a larger insight.\r\n\r\nRemember me kindly to all my Zurich friends, and especially to\r\nArnold Escher. . .\r\n\r\nAgassiz's increasing and at last wholly unmanageable correspondence\r\nattests the general sympathy for and cooperation with his\r\nscientific aims in the United States. In 1853, for instance, he had\r\nissued a circular, asking for collections of fishes from various\r\nfresh-water systems of the United States, in order that he might\r\nobtain certain data respecting the laws of their distribution and\r\nlocalization. To this he had hundreds of answers coming from all\r\nparts of the country, many of them very shrewd and observing,\r\ngiving facts respecting the habits of fishes, as well as concerning\r\ntheir habitat, and offering aid in the general object. Nor were\r\nthese empty promises. A great number and variety of collections,\r\nnow making part of the ichthyological treasures of the Museum at\r\nCambridge, were forwarded to him in answer to this appeal. Indeed,\r\nhe now began to reap, in a new form, the harvest of his wandering\r\nlecture tours. In this part of his American experience he had come\r\ninto contact with all classes of people, and had found some of his\r\nmost intelligent and sympathetic listeners in the working class.\r\nNow that he needed their assistance he often found his co-laborers\r\namong farmers, stock-raisers, sea-faring men, fishermen, and\r\nsailors. Many a New England captain, when he started on a cruise,\r\nhad on board collecting cans, furnished by Agassiz, to be filled in\r\ndistant ports or nearer home, as the case might be, and returned to\r\nthe Museum at Cambridge. One or two letters, written to scientific\r\nfriends at the time the above-mentioned circular was issued, will\r\ngive an idea of the way in which Agassiz laid out such\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 8, 1853.\r\n\r\n. . .I have been lately devising some method of learning how far\r\nanimals are truly autochthones, and how far they have extended\r\ntheir primitive boundaries. I will attempt to test that question\r\nwith Long Island, the largest of all the islands along our coast.\r\nFor this purpose I will for the present limit myself to the\r\nfresh-water fishes and shells, and for the sake of comparison I\r\nwill try to collect carefully all the species living in the rivers\r\nof Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, and see whether they are\r\nidentical with those of the island. Whatever may come out of such\r\nan investigation it will, at all events, furnish interesting data\r\nupon the local distribution of the species. . .I am almost\r\nconfident that it will lead to something interesting, for there is\r\none feature of importance in the case; the present surface of Long\r\nIsland is not older than the drift period; all its inhabitants\r\nmust, therefore, have been introduced since that time. I shall see\r\nthat I obtain similar collections from the upper course of the\r\nConnecticut, so as to ascertain whether there, as in the\r\nMississippi, the species differ at different heights of the river\r\nbasin. . .\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR S.S. HALDEMAN, COLUMBIA, PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 9, 1853.\r\n\r\n. . .While ascending the great Mississippi last spring I was struck\r\nwith the remarkable fact that the fishes differ essentially in the\r\ndifferent parts of that long water-course,--a fact I had already\r\nnoticed in the Rhine, Rhone, and Danube, though there the\r\ndifference arises chiefly from the occurrence, in the higher Alpine\r\nregions, of representatives of the trout family which are not found\r\nin the main river course. In the Mississippi, however, the case is\r\notherwise and very striking, inasmuch as we find here, at separate\r\nlatitudes, distinct species of the same genera, somewhat like the\r\ndifferences observed in distinct water-basins; and yet the river is\r\never flowing on past these animals, which remain, as it were,\r\nspell-bound to the regions most genial to them. The question at\r\nonce arises, do our smaller rivers present similar differences? I\r\nhave already taken steps to obtain complete collections of fishes,\r\nshells, and crayfishes from various stations on the Connecticut and\r\nthe Hudson, and their tributaries; and I should be very happy if I\r\ncould include the Susquehanna, Delaware, and Ohio in my\r\ncomparisons. My object in writing now is to inquire whether you\r\ncould assist me in making separate collections, as complete as\r\npossible, of all these animals from the north and west branches of\r\nthe Susquehanna, from the main river either at Harrisburg or\r\nColumbia, and from the Juniata, also from the Schuylkill, Lehigh,\r\nand Delaware, and from the Allegheny and Monongahela. I have Swiss\r\nfriends in the State of New York who have promised me to collect\r\nthe fishes from the head-waters of the Delaware and Susquehanna\r\nwithin the limits of the State of New York. I cannot, of course,\r\nexpect you to survey your State for me, but among your acquaintance\r\nin various parts of your State are there not those who, with proper\r\ndirections, could do the work for me? I would, of course, gladly\r\nrepay all their expenses. The subject seems to me so important as\r\nto justify any effort in that direction. Little may be added to the\r\nknowledge of the fishes themselves, for I suppose most of the\r\nspecies have been described either by De Kay, Kirtland, or Storer;\r\nbut a careful study of their special geographical distribution may\r\nfurnish results as important to zoology as the knowledge of the\r\nspecies themselves. If you cannot write yourself, will you give me\r\nthe names of such persons as might be persuaded to aid in the\r\nmatter. I know from your own observations in former times that you\r\nhave already collected similar facts for the Unios, so that you\r\nwill at once understand and appreciate my object. . .\r\n\r\nHe writes in the same strain and for the same object to Professor\r\nYandell, of Kentucky, adding: \"In this respect the State of\r\nKentucky is one of the most important of the Union, not only on\r\naccount of the many rivers which pass through its territory, but\r\nalso because it is one of the few States the fishes of which have\r\nbeen described by former observers, especially by Rafinesque in his\r\n\"Ichthyologia Ohioensis,\" so that a special knowledge of all his\r\noriginal types is a matter of primary importance for any one who\r\nwould compare the fishes of the different rivers of the West. . .Do\r\nyou know whether there is anything left of Rafinesque's collection\r\nof fishes in Lexington, and if so, whether the specimens are\r\nlabeled, as it would be very important to identify his species from\r\nhis own collection and his own labels? I never regretted more than\r\nnow that circumstances have not yet allowed me to visit your State\r\nand make a stay in Louisville.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Agassiz moved to a larger house, built for him by the\r\ncollege. Though very simple, it was on a liberal scale with respect\r\nto space; partly in order to accommodate his library, consisting of\r\nseveral thousand volumes, now for the first time collected and\r\narranged in one room. He became very fond of this Cambridge home,\r\nwhere, with few absences, he spent the remainder of his life. The\r\narchitect, Mr. Henry Greenough, was his personal friend, and from\r\nthe beginning the house adapted itself with a kindly readiness to\r\nwhatever plans developed under its roof. As will be seen, these\r\nwere not few, and were sometimes of considerable moment. For his\r\nwork also the house was extremely convenient. His habits in this\r\nrespect were, however, singularly independent of place and\r\ncircumstance. Unlike most studious men, he had no fixed spot in the\r\nhouse for writing. Although the library, with the usual outfit of\r\nwell-filled shelves, maps, large tables, etc., held his materials,\r\nhe brought what he needed for the evening by preference to the\r\ndrawing-room, and there, with his paper on his knee, and his books\r\nfor reference on a chair beside him, he wrote and read as busily as\r\nif he were quite alone. Sometimes when dancing and music were going\r\non among the young people of the family and their guests, he drew a\r\nlittle table into the corner of the room, and continued his\r\noccupations as undisturbed and engrossed as if he had been in\r\ncomplete solitude,--only looking up from time to time with a\r\npleased smile or an apt remark, which showed that he did not lose\r\nbut rather enjoyed what was going on about him.\r\n\r\nHis children's friends were his friends. As his daughters grew up,\r\nhe had the habit of inviting their more intimate companions to his\r\nlibrary for an afternoon weekly. On these occasions there was\r\nalways some subject connected with the study of nature under\r\ndiscussion, but the talk was so easy and so fully illustrated that\r\nit did not seem like a lesson. It is pleasant to remember that in\r\nlater years Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson revived this custom for his own\r\ndaughters; and their friends (being, indeed, with few changes, the\r\nsame set of young people as had formerly met in Agassiz's library)\r\nused to meet in Mr. Emerson's study at Concord for a similar\r\nobject. He talked to them of poetry and literature and philosophy\r\nas Agassiz had talked to them of nature. Those were golden days,\r\nnot to be forgotten by any who shared their happy privilege.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1855 Agassiz endeavored to resume his public\r\nlectures as a means of increasing his resources. He was again,\r\nhowever, much exhausted when spring came, and it seemed necessary\r\nto seek some other means of support, for without considering\r\nscientific expenses, his salary of fifteen hundred dollars did not\r\nsuffice for the maintenance of his family. Under these\r\ncircumstances it occurred to his wife and his two older children,\r\nnow of an age to assist her in such a scheme, that a school for\r\nyoung ladies might be established in the upper part of the new and\r\nlarger house. By the removal of one or two partitions, ample room\r\ncould be obtained for the accommodation of a sufficient number of\r\npupils, and if successful such a school would perhaps make good in\r\na pecuniary sense the lecturing tours which were not only a great\r\nfatigue to Agassiz, but an interruption also to all consecutive\r\nscientific work. In consultation with friends these plans were\r\npartly matured before they were confided to Agassiz himself. When\r\nthe domestic conspirators revealed their plot, his surprise and\r\npleasure knew no bounds. The first idea had been simply to\r\nestablish a private school on the usual plan, only referring to his\r\ngreater experience for advice and direction in its general\r\norganization. But he claimed at once an active share in the work.\r\nUnder his inspiring influence the outline enlarged, and when the\r\ncircular announcing the school was issued, it appeared under his\r\nname, and contained these words in addition to the programme of\r\nstudies: \"I shall myself superintend the methods of instruction and\r\ntuition, and while maintaining that regularity and precision in the\r\nstudies so important to mental training shall endeavor to prevent\r\nthe necessary discipline from falling into a lifeless routine,\r\nalike deadening to the spirit of teacher and pupil. It is farther\r\nmy intention to take the immediate charge of the instruction in\r\nPhysical Geography, Natural History, and Botany, giving a lecture\r\ndaily, Saturdays excepted, on one or other of these subjects,\r\nillustrated by specimens, models, maps, and drawings.\"\r\n\r\nIn order not to interrupt the course of the narrative, the history\r\nof this undertaking in its sequence and general bearing on his life\r\nand work may be completed here in a few words. This school secured\r\nto him many happy and comparatively tranquil years. It enabled him\r\nto meet both domestic and scientific expenses, and to pay the heavy\r\ndebt he had brought from Europe as the penalty of his \"Fossil\r\nFishes\" and his investigations on the glaciers. When the school\r\nclosed after eight years he was again a free man. With an increased\r\nsalary from the college, and with such provision for the Museum\r\n(thanks to the generosity of the State and of individuals) as\r\nrendered it in a great degree independent, he was never again\r\ninvolved in the pecuniary anxieties of his earlier career. The\r\noccupation of teaching was so congenial to him that his part in the\r\ninstruction of the school did not at any time weigh heavily upon\r\nhim. He never had an audience more responsive and more eager to\r\nlearn than the sixty or seventy girls who gathered every day at the\r\nclose of the morning to hear his daily lecture; nor did he ever\r\ngive to any audience lectures more carefully prepared, more\r\ncomprehensive in their range of subjects, more lofty in their tone\r\nof thought. As a teacher he always discriminated between the\r\nspecial student, and the one to whom he cared to impart only such a\r\nknowledge of the facts of nature, as would make the world at least\r\npartially intelligible to him. To a school of young girls he did\r\nnot think of teaching technical science, and yet the subjects of\r\nhis lectures comprised very abstruse and comprehensive questions.\r\nIt was the simplicity and clearness of his method which made them\r\nso interesting to his young listeners. \"What I wish for you,\" he\r\nwould say, \"is a culture that is alive, active, susceptible of\r\nfarther development. Do not think that I care to teach you this or\r\nthe other special science. My instruction is only intended to show\r\nyou the thoughts in nature which science reveals, and the facts I\r\ngive you are useful only, or chiefly, for this object.\"\r\n\r\nRunning over the titles of his courses during several consecutive\r\nyears of this school instruction they read: Physical Geography and\r\nPaleontology; Zoology; Botany; Coral Reefs; Glaciers; Structure and\r\nFormation of Mountains; Geographical Distribution of Animals;\r\nGeological Succession of Animals; Growth and Development of\r\nAnimals; Philosophy of Nature, etc. With the help of drawings,\r\nmaps, bas-reliefs, specimens, and countless illustrations on the\r\nblackboard, these subjects were made clear to the pupils, and the\r\nlecture hour was anticipated as the brightest of the whole morning.\r\nIt soon became a habit with friends and neighbors, and especially\r\nwith the mothers of the scholars, to drop in for the lectures, and\r\nthus the school audience was increased by a small circle of older\r\nlisteners. The corps of teachers was also gradually enlarged. The\r\nneighborhood of the university was a great advantage in this\r\nrespect, and Agassiz had the cooperation not only of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Professor Felton, but of others among his\r\ncolleagues, who took classes in special departments, or gave\r\nlectures in history and literature.\r\n\r\nThis school opened in 1855 and closed in 1863. The civil war then\r\nengrossed all thoughts, and interfered somewhat also with the\r\nsuccess of private undertakings. Partly on this account, partly\r\nalso because it had ceased to be a pecuniary necessity, it seemed\r\nwise to give up the school at this time. The friendly relations\r\nformed there did not, however, cease with it. For years afterward\r\non the last Thursday of June (the day of the annual closing of the\r\nschool) a meeting of the old pupils was held at the Museum, which\r\ndid not exist when the school began, but was fully established\r\nbefore its close. There Agassiz showed them the progress of his\r\nscientific work, told them of his future plans for the institution,\r\nand closed with a lecture such as he used to give them in their\r\nschool-days. The last of these meetings took place in 1873, the\r\nlast year of his own life. The memory of it is connected with a\r\ngift to the Museum of four thousand and fifty dollars from a number\r\nof the scholars, now no longer girls, but women with their own\r\ncares and responsibilities. Hearing that there was especial need of\r\nmeans for the care of the more recent collections, they had\r\nsubscribed this sum among themselves to express their affection for\r\ntheir old teacher, as well as their interest in his work, and in\r\nthe institution he had founded. His letter of acknowledgment to the\r\none among them who had acted as their treasurer makes a fitting\r\nclose to this chapter.\r\n\r\n. . .Hardly anything in my life has touched me more deeply than the\r\ngift I received this week from my school-girls. From no source in\r\nthe world could sympathy be more genial to me. The money I shall\r\nappropriate to a long-cherished scheme of mine, a special work in\r\nthe Museum which must be exclusively my own,--the arrangement of a\r\nspecial collection illustrating in a nutshell, as it were, all the\r\nrelations existing among animals,--which I have deferred because\r\nother things were more pressing, and our means have been\r\ninsufficient. The feeling that you are all working with me will be\r\neven more cheering than the material help, much needed as that is.\r\nI wish I could write to each individually. I shall try to find some\r\nmeans of expressing my thanks more widely. Meantime I write to you\r\nas treasurer, and beg you, as far as you can do so without too much\r\ntrouble, to express my gratitude to others. Will you also say to\r\nthose whom you chance to meet that I shall be at the Museum on the\r\nlast Thursday of June, at half-past eleven o'clock. I shall be\r\ndelighted to see all to whom it is convenient to come. The Museum\r\nhas grown not only in magnitude, but in scientific significance,\r\nand I like from time to time to give you an account of its\r\nprogress, and of my own work and aims. How much thought and care\r\nand effort this kind plan of yours must have involved, scattered as\r\nyou all are! It cannot have been easy to collect the names and\r\naddresses of all those whose signatures it was delightful to me to\r\nsee again. Words seem to me very poor, but you will accept for\r\nyourself and your school-mates the warm thanks and affectionate\r\nregards of your old friend and teacher.\r\n\r\nL.R. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\n1855-1860: AGE 48-53.\r\n\r\n\"Contributions to Natural History of the United States.\"\r\nRemarkable Subscription.\r\nReview of the Work.\r\nIts Reception in Europe and America.\r\nLetters from Humboldt and Owen concerning it.\r\nBirthday.\r\nLongfellow's Verses.\r\nLaboratory at Nahant.\r\nInvitation to the Museum of Natural History in Paris.\r\nFounding of Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge.\r\nSummer Vacation in Europe.\r\n\r\nA few months earlier than the school circular Agassiz issued\r\nanother prospectus, which had an even more important bearing upon\r\nhis future work. This was the prospectus for his \"Contributions to\r\nthe Natural History of the United States.\" It was originally\r\nplanned in ten volumes, every volume to be, however, absolutely\r\nindependent, so that the completeness of each part should not be\r\nimpaired by any possible interruption of the sequence. The mass of\r\noriginal material accumulated upon his hands ever since his arrival\r\nin America made such a publication almost imperative, but the\r\ncostliness of a large illustrated work deterred him. The \"Poissons\r\nFossiles\" had shown him the peril of entering upon such an\r\nenterprise without capital. Perhaps he would never have dared to\r\nundertake it but for a friendly suggestion which opened a way out\r\nof his perplexities. Mr. Francis C. Gray, of Boston, who felt not\r\nonly the interest of a personal friend in the matter, but also that\r\nof one who was himself a lover of letters and science, proposed an\r\nappeal to the public spirit of the country in behalf of a work\r\ndevoted entirely to the Natural History of the United States. Mr.\r\nGray assumed the direction of the business details, set the\r\nsubscription afloat, stimulated its success by his own liberal\r\ncontributions, by letters, by private and public appeals. The\r\nresult far exceeded the most sanguine expectations of those\r\ninterested in its success. Indeed, considering the purely\r\nscientific character of the work, the number of subscribers for it\r\nwas extraordinary, and showed again the hold Agassiz had taken upon\r\nthe minds and affections of the people in general. The contributors\r\nwere by no means confined to Boston and Cambridge, although the\r\nMassachusetts list was naturally the largest, nor were they found\r\nexclusively among literary and scientific circles. On the contrary,\r\nthe subscription list, to the astonishment of the publishers, was\r\nincreased daily by unsolicited names, sent in from all sections of\r\nthe country, and from various grades of life and occupation. In\r\nreference to the character of this subscription Agassiz says in his\r\nPreface: \"I must beg my European readers to remember that this work\r\nis written in America, and more especially for Americans; and that\r\nthe community to which it is particularly addressed has very\r\ndifferent wants from those of the reading public in Europe. There\r\nis not a class of learned men here distinct from the other\r\ncultivated members of the community. On the contrary, so general is\r\nthe desire for knowledge, that I expect to see my book read by\r\noperatives, by fishermen, by farmers, quite as extensively as by\r\nthe students in our colleges or by the learned professions, and it\r\nis but proper that I should endeavor to make myself understood by\r\nall.\" If Agassiz, perhaps, overestimated in this statement the\r\nappreciation of the reading public in the United States for pure\r\nscientific research, it was because the number and variety of his\r\nsubscribers gave evidence of a cordiality toward his work which\r\nsurprised as much as it gratified him. On the list there were also\r\nsome of his old European subscribers to the \"Poissons Fossiles,\"\r\namong them the King of Prussia, who still continued, under the\r\ninfluence of Humboldt, to feel an interest in his work.\r\n\r\nFROM HUMBOLDT TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1, 1856.\r\n\r\n. . .I hear that by some untoward circumstances, no doubt\r\naccidental, you have never received, my dear Agassiz, the letter\r\nexpressing the pleasure which I share with all true lovers of\r\nscience respecting your important undertaking, \"Contributions to\r\nthe Natural History of the United States.\" You must have been\r\nastonished at my silence, remembering, not only the affectionate\r\nrelations we have held to each other ever since your first sojourn\r\nat Paris, but also the admiration I have never ceased to feel for\r\nthe great and solid works which we owe to your sagacious mind and\r\nyour incomparable intellectual energy. . .I approve especially the\r\ngeneral conceptions which lie at the base of the plan you have\r\ntraced. I admire the long series of physiological investigations,\r\nbeginning with the embryology of the so-called simple and lower\r\norganisms and ascending by degrees to the more complicated. I\r\nadmire that ever-renewed comparison of the types belonging to our\r\nplanet, in its present condition, with those now found only in a\r\nfossil state, so abundant in the immense space lying between the\r\nshores opposite to northern Europe and northern Asia. The\r\ngeographical distribution of organic forms in curves of equal\r\ndensity of occupation represents in great degree the inflexions of\r\nthe isothermal lines. . .I am charged by the king, who knows the\r\nvalue of your older works, and who still feels for you the\r\naffectionate regard which he formerly expressed in person, to\r\nrequest that you will place his name at the head of your long list\r\nof subscribers. He wishes that an excursion across the Atlantic\r\nvalley may one day bring you, who have so courageously braved\r\nAlpine summits, to the historic hill of Sans Souci. . .\r\n\r\nSomething of Agassiz's astonishment and pleasure at the\r\nencouragement given to his projected work is told in his letters.\r\nTo his old friend Professor Valenciennes, in Paris, he writes: \"I\r\nhave just had an evidence of what one may do here in the interest\r\nof science. Some six months ago I formed a plan for the publication\r\nof my researches in America, and determined to carry it out with\r\nall possible care and beauty of finish. I estimated my materials at\r\nten volumes, quarto, and having fixed the price at 60 francs (12\r\ndollars) a volume, thought I might, perhaps, dispose of five\r\nhundred. I brought out my prospectus, and I have to-day seventeen\r\nhundred subscribers. What do you say to that for a work which is to\r\ncost six hundred francs a copy, and of which nothing has as yet\r\nappeared? Nor is the list closed yet, for every day I receive new\r\nsubscriptions,--this very morning one from California! Where will\r\nnot the love of science find its niche!\". . .\r\n\r\nIn the same strain he says, at a little later date, to Sir Charles\r\nLyell: \"You will, no doubt, be pleased to learn that the first\r\nvolume of my new work, 'Contributions to the Natural History of the\r\nUnited States,' which is to consist of ten volumes, quarto, is now\r\nprinting, to come out this summer. I hope it will show that I have\r\nnot been idle during ten years' silence. I am somewhat anxious\r\nabout the reception of my first chapter, headed, 'Classification,'\r\nwhich contains anything but what zoologists would generally expect\r\nunder that head. The subscription is marvelous. Conceive twenty-one\r\nhundred names before the appearance of the first pages of a work\r\ncosting one hundred and twenty dollars! It places in my hands the\r\nmeans of doing henceforth for Natural History what I had never\r\ndreamed of before.\". . .\r\n\r\nThis work, as originally planned, was never completed. It was cut\r\nshort by ill-health and by the pressure of engagements arising from\r\nthe rapid development of the great Museum, which finally became, as\r\nwill be seen, the absorbing interest of his life. As it stands, the\r\n\"Contributions to the Natural History of the United States\"\r\nconsists of four large quarto volumes. The first two are divided\r\ninto three parts, namely: 1st. An Essay on Classification. 2nd. The\r\nNorth American Testudinata. 3rd. The Embryology of the Turtle,--the\r\nlatter two being illustrated by thirty-four plates. The third and\r\nfourth volumes are devoted to the Radiata, and consist of five\r\nparts, namely: 1st. Acalephs in general. 2nd. Ctenophorae. 3rd.\r\nDiscophorae. 4th. Hydroida. 5th. Homologies of the Radiates,\r\n--illustrated by forty-six plates.* (* The plates are of rare\r\naccuracy and beauty, and were chiefly drawn by A. Sonrel, though\r\nmany of the microscopic drawings were made by Professor H.J. Clark,\r\nwho was at that time Agassiz's private assistant. For details\r\nrespecting Professor Clark's share in this work, and also\r\nconcerning the aid of various kinds furnished to the author during\r\nits preparation, the reader is referred to the Preface of the\r\nvolumes themselves.)\r\n\r\nFor originality of material, clearness of presentation, and beauty\r\nof illustration, these volumes have had their full recognition as\r\nmodels of scientific work. Their philosophy was, perhaps, too much\r\nout of harmony with the current theories of the day to be\r\nacceptable. In the \"Essay on Classification\" especially, Agassiz\r\nbrought out with renewed earnestness his conviction that the animal\r\nworld rests upon certain abstract conceptions, persistent and\r\nindestructible. He insists that while physical influences maintain,\r\nand within certain limits modify, organisms, they have never\r\naffected typical structure,--those characters, namely, upon which\r\nthe great groups of the animal kingdom are united. From his point\r\nof view, therefore, what environment can do serves to emphasize\r\nwhat it cannot do. For the argument on which these conclusions are\r\nbased we refer to the book itself. The discussion of this question\r\noccupies, however, only the first portion of the volume, two thirds\r\nof which are devoted to a general consideration of classification,\r\nand the ideas which it embodies, with a review of the modern\r\nsystems of zoology.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was one of many in the same tone received from\r\nhis European correspondents concerning this work.\r\n\r\nFROM RICHARD OWEN.\r\n\r\nDecember 9, 1857.\r\n\r\n. . .I cannot permit a day to elapse without thanking you for the\r\ntwo volumes of your great work on American zoology, which, from\r\nyour masterly and exhaustive style of treatment, becomes the most\r\nimportant contribution to the right progress of zoological science\r\nin all parts of the world where progress permits its cultivation.\r\nIt is worthy of the author of the classical work on fossil fishes;\r\nand such works, like the Cyclopean structures of antiquity, are\r\nbuilt to endure. I feel and I beg to express a fervent hope that\r\nyou may be spared in health and vigor to see the completion of your\r\ngreat plan.\r\n\r\nI have placed in Mr. Trubner's hands a set of the numbers (6) of my\r\n\"History of British Fossil Reptiles,\" which have already appeared;\r\na seventh will soon be out, and as they will be sent to you in\r\nsuccession I hope you will permit me to make a small and inadequate\r\nreturn for your liberality in the gift of your work by adding your\r\nname to the list of my subscribers. . .\r\n\r\nBelieve me always truly yours,\r\n\r\nRICHARD OWEN.\r\n\r\nAgassiz had promised himself that the first volume of his new work\r\nshould be finished in time for his fiftieth birthday,--a milestone\r\nalong the road, as it were, to mark his half century. Upon this\r\nself-appointed task he spent himself with the passion dominated by\r\npatience, which characterized him when his whole heart was bent\r\ntoward an end. For weeks he wrote many hours of the day and a great\r\npart of the night, going out sometimes into the darkness and the\r\nopen air to cool the fever of work, and then returning to his desk\r\nagain. He felt himself that the excitement was too great, and in\r\nproportion to the strain was the relief when he set the seal of\r\nfinis on his last page within the appointed time.\r\n\r\nHis special students, young men who fully shared his scientific\r\nlife and rewarded his generosity by an affectionate devotion,\r\nknowing, perhaps, that he himself associated the completion of his\r\nbook with his birthday, celebrated both events by a serenade on the\r\neve of his anniversary. They took into their confidence Mr. Otto\r\nDresel, warmly valued by Agassiz both as friend and musician, and\r\nhe arranged their midnight programme for them. Always sure of\r\nfinding their professor awake and at work at that hour, they\r\nstationed the musicians before the house, and as the last stroke of\r\ntwelve sounded, the succeeding stillness was broken by men's voices\r\nsinging a Bach choral. When Agassiz stepped out to see whence came\r\nthis pleasant salutation, he was met by his young friends bringing\r\nflowers and congratulations. Then followed one number after another\r\nof the well-ordered selection, into which was admitted here and\r\nthere a German student song in memory of Agassiz's own university\r\nlife at Heidelberg and Munich. It was late, or rather early, since\r\nthe new day was already begun, before the little concert was over\r\nand the guests had dispersed. It is difficult to reproduce with\r\nanything like its original glow and coloring a scene of this kind.\r\nIt will no more be called back than the hour or the moonlight night\r\nwhich had the warmth and softness of June. It is recorded here only\r\nbecause it illustrates the intimate personal sympathy between\r\nAgassiz and his students.\r\n\r\nFor this occasion also were written the well-known birthday verses\r\nby Longfellow, which were read the next day at a dinner given to\r\nAgassiz by the \"Saturday Club.\" In speaking of Longfellow's\r\nrelation to this club, Holmes says \"On one occasion he read a short\r\npoem at the table. It was in honor of Agassiz's birthday, and I\r\ncannot forget the very modest, delicate musical way in which he\r\nread his charming verses.\" Although included in many collections of\r\nLongfellow's Poems, they are reproduced here, because the story\r\nseems incomplete without them.\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY OF AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n    It was fifty years ago,\r\n    In the pleasant month of May,\r\n    In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,\r\n    A child in its cradle lay.\r\n\r\n    And Nature, the old nurse, took\r\n    The child upon her knee,\r\n    Saying: \"Here is a story-book\r\n    Thy Father has written for thee.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Come wander with me,\" she said,\r\n    \"Into regions yet untrod;\r\n    And read what is still unread\r\n    In the manuscripts of God.\"\r\n\r\n    And he wandered away and away\r\n    With Nature, the dear old nurse,\r\n    Who sang to him night and day\r\n    The rhymes of the universe.\r\n\r\n    And whenever the way seemed long,\r\n    Or his heart began to fail,\r\n    She would sing a more wonderful song,\r\n    Or tell a more marvelous tale.\r\n\r\n    So she keeps him still a child,\r\n    And will not let him go,\r\n    Though at times his heart beats wild\r\n    For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;\r\n\r\n    Though at times he hears in his dreams\r\n    The Ranz des Vaches of old,\r\n    And the rush of mountain streams\r\n    From glaciers clear and cold;\r\n\r\n    And the mother at home says, \"Hark!\r\n    For his voice I listen and yearn;\r\n    It is growing late and dark,\r\n    And my boy does not return!\"\r\n\r\nMay 28, 1857.\r\n\r\nLongfellow had an exquisite touch for occasions of this kind,\r\nwhether serious or mirthful. Once, when some years after this\r\nAgassiz was keeping Christmas Eve with his children and\r\ngrandchildren, there arrived a basket of wine containing six old\r\nbottles of rare vintage. They introduced themselves in a charming\r\nFrench \"Noel\" as pilgrims from beyond the sea who came to give\r\nChristmas greeting to the master of the house. Gay pilgrims were\r\nthese six \"gaillards,\" and they were accompanied by the following\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\n\"A Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all the house of Agassiz!\r\n\r\n\"I send also six good wishes in the shape of bottles. Or is it\r\nwine?\r\n\r\n\"It is both; good wine and good wishes, and kind memories of you on\r\nthis Christmas Eve.\"\r\n\r\nH.W.L.\r\n\r\nAn additional word about the \"Saturday Club,\" the fame of which has\r\nspread beyond the city of its origin, may not be amiss here.\r\nNotwithstanding his close habits of work Agassiz was eminently\r\nsocial, and to this club he was especially attached. Dr. Holmes\r\nsays of it in his volume on Emerson, who was one of its most\r\nconstant members: \"At one end of the table sat Longfellow, florid,\r\nquiet, benignant, soft-voiced, a most agreeable rather than a\r\nbrilliant talker, but a man upon whom it was always pleasant to\r\nlook,--whose silence was better than many another man's\r\nconversation. At the other end sat Agassiz, robust, sanguine,\r\nanimated, full of talk, boy-like in his laughter. The stranger who\r\nshould have asked who were the men ranged along the sides of the\r\ntable would have heard in answer the names of Hawthorne, Motley,\r\nDana, Lowell, Whipple, Peirce, the distinguished mathematician,\r\nJudge Hoar, eminent at the bar and in the cabinet, Dwight, the\r\nleading musical critic of Boston for a whole generation, Sumner,\r\nthe academic champion of freedom, Andrew, 'the great War Governor'\r\nof Massachusetts, Dr. Howe, the philanthropist, William Hunt, the\r\npainter, with others not unworthy of such company.\" We may complete\r\nthe list and add the name of Holmes himself, to whose presence the\r\nclub owed so much of its wit and wisdom. In such company the guests\r\nwere tempted to linger long, and if Holmes has described the circle\r\naround the table, Lowell has celebrated the late walk at night\r\nacross the bridge as he and Agassiz returned to Cambridge on foot\r\ntogether. To break the verse by quotation would mar the quiet scene\r\nand interrupt the rambling pleasant talk it so graphically\r\ndescribes. But we may keep the parting words:\r\n\r\n\"At last, arrived at where our paths divide,'Good night!' and, ere\r\nthe distance grew too wide, 'Good night!' again; and now with\r\ncheated ear I half hear his who mine shall never hear.\"\r\n\r\n(* See Memorial poem, entitled \"Agassiz\", by James Russell Lowell.)\r\n\r\nAgassiz was now the possessor of a small laboratory by the\r\nimmediate sea-coast. It was situated on the northeastern shore of\r\nNahant, within a stone's throw of broken and bold rocks, where the\r\ndeep pools furnished him with ever fresh specimens from natural\r\naquariums which were re-stocked at every rise of the tide. This\r\nlaboratory, with a small cottage adjoining, which was shared during\r\nthe summer between his own family and that of Professor Felton, was\r\nthe gift of his father-in-law, Mr. Cary. So carefully were his\r\nwishes considered that the microscope table stood on a flat rock\r\nsunk in the earth and detached from the floor, in order that no\r\nfootstep or accidental jarring of door or window in other parts of\r\nthe building might disturb him at his work.\r\n\r\nThere, summer after summer, he pursued his researches on the\r\nmedusae; from the smaller and more exquisite kinds, such as the\r\nPleurobrachyias, Idyias, and Bolinas, to the massive Cyaneas, with\r\ntheir large disks and heavy tentacles, many yards in length.\r\nNothing can be prettier than the smaller kinds of jellyfishes.\r\nTheir structure is so delicate, yet so clearly defined, their color\r\nso soft, yet often so brilliant, their texture so transparent, that\r\nyou seek in vain among terrestrial forms for terms of comparison,\r\nand are tempted to say that nature has done her finest work in the\r\nsea rather than on land. Sometimes hundreds of these smaller\r\nmedusae might be seen floating together in the deep glass bowls, or\r\njars, or larger vessels with which Agassiz's laboratory at Nahant\r\nwas furnished. When the supply was exhausted, new specimens were\r\neasily to be obtained by a row in a dory a mile or two from shore,\r\neither in the hot, still noon, when the jelly-fish rise toward the\r\nsurface, or at night, over a brilliantly phosphorescent sea, when\r\nthey are sure to be abundant, since they themselves furnish much of\r\nthe phosphorescence. In these little excursions, many new and\r\ninteresting things came to his nets beside those he was seeking.\r\nThe fishermen, also, were his friends and coadjutors. They never\r\nfailed to bring him whatever of rare or curious fell into their\r\nhands, sometimes even turning aside from their professional calling\r\nto give the laboratory preference over the market.\r\n\r\nNeither was his summer work necessarily suspended during winter,\r\nhis Cambridge and Nahant homes being only about fifteen miles\r\ndistant from each other. He writes to his friends, the Holbrooks,\r\nat this time, \"You can hardly imagine what a delightful place\r\nNahant is for me now. I can trace the growth of my little marine\r\nanimals all the year round without interruption, by going\r\noccasionally over there during the winter. I have at this moment\r\nyoung medusae budding from their polyp nurses, which I expect to\r\nsee freeing themselves in a few weeks.\" In later years, when his\r\ninvestigations on the medusae were concluded, so far as any\r\nteaching from the open book of Nature can be said to be concluded,\r\nhe pursued here, during a number of years, investigations upon the\r\nsharks and skates. For this work, which should have made one of the\r\nseries of \"Contributions,\" he left much material, unhappily not\r\nready for publication.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1857, Agassiz received the following letter from M.\r\nRouland, Minister of Public Instruction in France.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 19, 1857.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nBy the decease of M. d'Orbigny the chair of paleontology in the\r\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris becomes vacant. You are French;\r\nyou have enriched your native country by your eminent works and\r\nlaborious researches. You are a corresponding member of the\r\nInstitute. The emperor would gladly recall to France a savant so\r\ndistinguished. In his name I offer you the vacant chair, and should\r\ncongratulate your country on the return of a son who has shown\r\nhimself capable of such devotion to science.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my highest esteem,\r\n\r\nROULAND.\r\n\r\nHad it been told to Agassiz when he left Europe that in ten years\r\nhe should be recalled to fill one of the coveted places at the\r\nJardin des Plantes, the great centre of scientific life and\r\ninfluence in France, he would hardly have believed himself capable\r\nof refusing it. Nor does a man reject what would once have seemed\r\nto him a great boon without a certain regret. Such momentary regret\r\nhe felt perhaps, but not an instant of doubt. His answer expressed\r\nhis gratitude and his pleasure in finding himself so remembered in\r\nEurope. He pleaded his work in America as his excuse for declining\r\na position which he nevertheless considered the most brilliant that\r\ncould be offered to a naturalist. In conclusion he adds: \"Permit me\r\nto correct an error concerning myself. I am not French, although of\r\nFrench origin. My family has been Swiss for centuries, and spite of\r\nmy ten years' exile I am Swiss still.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence did not end here. A few months later the offer\r\nwas courteously renewed by M. Rouland, with the express condition\r\nthat the place should remain open for one or even two years to\r\nallow time for the completion of the work Agassiz had now on hand.\r\nTo this second appeal he could only answer that his work here was\r\nthe work not of years, but of his life, and once more decline the\r\noffer. That his refusal was taken in good part is evident from the\r\nfact that the order of the Legion of Honor was sent to him soon\r\nafter, and that from time to time he received friendly letters from\r\nthe Minister of Public Instruction, who occasionally consulted him\r\nupon general questions of scientific moment.\r\n\r\nThis invitation excited a good deal of interest among Agassiz's old\r\nfriends in Europe. Some urged him to accept it, others applauded\r\nhis resolve to remain out of the great arena of competition and\r\nambition. Among the latter was Humboldt. The following extract is\r\nfrom a letter of his (May 9, 1858) to Mr. George Ticknor, of\r\nBoston, who had been one of Agassiz's kindest and best friends in\r\nAmerica from the moment of his arrival. \"Agassiz's large and\r\nbeautiful work (the first two volumes) reached me a few days since.\r\nIt will produce a great effect both by the breadth of its general\r\nviews and by the extreme sagacity of its special embryological\r\nobservations. I have never believed that this illustrious man, who\r\nis also a man of warm heart, a noble soul, would accept the\r\ngenerous offers made to him from Paris. I knew that gratitude would\r\nkeep him in the new country, where he finds such an immense\r\nterritory to explore, and such liberal aid in his work.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing of this offer to a friend Agassiz himself says: \"On one\r\nside, my cottage at Nahant by the sea-shore, the reef of Florida,\r\nthe vessels of the Coast Survey at my command from Nova Scotia to\r\nMexico, and, if I choose, all along the coast of the Pacific,--and\r\non the other, the Jardin des Plantes, with all its accumulated\r\ntreasures. Rightly considered, the chance of studying nature must\r\nprevail over the attractions of the (Paris) Museum. I hope I shall\r\nbe wise enough not to be tempted even by the prospect of a new\r\nedition of the 'Poissons Fossiles.'\"\r\n\r\nTo his old friend Charles Martins, the naturalist, he writes: \"The\r\nwork I have undertaken here, and the confidence shown in me by\r\nthose who have at heart the intellectual development of this\r\ncountry, make my return to Europe impossible for the present; and,\r\nas you have well understood, I prefer to build anew here rather\r\nthan to fight my way in the midst of the coteries of Paris. Were I\r\noffered absolute power for the reorganization of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, with a revenue of fifty thousand francs, I should not\r\naccept it. I like my independence better.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that Agassiz had received and declined this offer from the\r\nFrench government seemed to arouse anew the public interest in his\r\nprojects and prospects here. It was felt that a man who was ready\r\nto make an alliance so uncompromising with the interests of science\r\nin the United States should not be left in a precarious and\r\ndifficult position. His collections were still heaped together in a\r\nslight wooden building. The fact that a great part of them were\r\npreserved in alcohol made them especially in danger from fire. A\r\nspark, a match carelessly thrown down, might destroy them all in\r\nhalf an hour, for with material so combustible, help would be\r\nunavailing. This fear was never out of his mind. It disturbed his\r\npeace by day and his rest by night. That frail structure, crowded\r\nfrom garret to cellar with seeming rubbish, with boxes, cases,\r\nbarrels, casks still unpacked and piled one above the other, held\r\nfor him the treasure out of which he would give form and substance\r\nto the dream of his boyhood and the maturer purpose of his manhood.\r\nThe hope of creating a great museum intelligently related in all\r\nits parts, reflecting nature, and illustrating the history of the\r\nanimal kingdom in the past and the present, had always tempted his\r\nimagination. Nor was it merely as a comprehensive and orderly\r\ncollection that he thought of it. From an educational point of view\r\nit had an even greater value for him. His love of teaching prompted\r\nhim no less than his love of science. Indeed, he hoped to make his\r\nideal museum a powerful auxiliary in the interests of the schools\r\nand teachers throughout the State, and less directly throughout the\r\ncountry. He hoped it would become one of the centres for the\r\nradiation of knowledge, and that the investigations carried on\r\nwithin its walls would find means of publication, and be a fresh,\r\noriginal contribution to the science of the day. This hope was\r\nfully realized. The first number of the Museum Bulletin was\r\npublished in March, 1863, the first number of the Illustrated\r\nCatalogue in 1864, and both publications have been continued with\r\nregularity ever since.* (* At the time of Agassiz's death nearly\r\nthree volumes of the Bulletin had been published, and the third\r\nvolume of the \"Memoirs\" (Illustrated Catalogue Number 7) had been\r\nbegun.)\r\n\r\nIn laying out the general plan, which was rarely absent from his\r\nthought, he distinguished between the demands which the specialist\r\nand the general observer might make upon an institution intended to\r\ninstruct and benefit both. Here the special student should find in\r\nthe laboratories and work rooms all the needed material for his\r\ninvestigations, stored in large collections, with duplicates enough\r\nto allow for that destruction of specimens which is necessarily\r\ninvolved in original research. The casual visitor meanwhile should\r\nwalk through exhibition rooms, not simply crowded with objects to\r\ndelight and interest him, but so arranged that the selection of\r\nevery specimen should have reference to its part and place in\r\nnature; while the whole should be so combined as to explain, so far\r\nas known, the faunal and systematic relations of animals in the\r\nactual world, and in the geological formations; or, in other words,\r\ntheir succession in time, and their distribution in space.\r\n\r\nA favorite part of his plan was a room which he liked to call his\r\nsynoptic room. Here was to be the most compact and yet the fullest\r\nstatement in material form of the animal kingdom as a whole, an\r\nepitome of the creation, as it were. Of course the specimens must\r\nbe few in so limited a space, but each one was to be characteristic\r\nof one or other of the various groups included under every large\r\ndivision. Thus each object would contribute to the explanation of\r\nthe general plan. On the walls there were to be large, legible\r\ninscriptions, serving as a guide to the whole, and making this room\r\na simple but comprehensive lesson in natural history. It was\r\nintended to be the entrance room for visitors, and to serve as an\r\nintroduction to the more detailed presentation of the same vast\r\nsubject, given by the faunal and systematic collections in the\r\nother exhibition rooms.\r\n\r\nThe standard of work involved in this scheme is shown in many of\r\nhis letters to his students and assistants, to whom he looked for\r\naid in its execution. To one he writes: \"You will get your synoptic\r\nseries only after you have worked up in detail the systematic\r\ncollection as a whole, the faunal collections in their totality,\r\nthe geological sequence of the entire group under consideration, as\r\nwell as its embryology and geographical distribution. Then alone\r\nwill you be able to know the representatives in each series which\r\nwill best throw light upon it and complete the other series.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not live to fill in this comprehensive outline with the\r\ncompleteness which he intended, but all its details were fully\r\nexplained by him before his death, and since that time have been\r\ncarried out by his son, Alexander Agassiz. The synoptic room, and\r\nin great part the systematic and faunal collections, are now\r\narranged and under exhibition, and the throngs of visitors during\r\nall the pleasant months of the year attest the interest they\r\nexcite.\r\n\r\nThis conception, of which the present Museum is the expression, was\r\nmatured in the brain of the founder before a brick of the building\r\nwas laid, or a dollar provided for the support of such an\r\ninstitution. It existed for him as his picture does for the artist\r\nbefore it lives upon the canvas. One must have been the intimate\r\ncompanion of his thoughts to know how and to what degree it\r\npossessed his imagination, to his delight always, yet sometimes to\r\nhis sorrow also, for he had it and he had it not. The thought alone\r\nwas his; the means of execution were far beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nHis plan was, however, known to many of his friends, and especially\r\nhe had explained it to Mr. Francis C. Gray, whose intellectual\r\nsympathy made him a delightful listener to the presentation of any\r\nenlightened purpose. In 1858 Mr. Gray died, leaving in his will the\r\nsum of fifty thousand dollars for the establishment of a Museum of\r\nComparative Zoology, with the condition that this sum should be\r\nused neither for the erection of buildings nor for salaries, but\r\nfor the purely scientific needs of such an institution. Though this\r\nbequest was not connected in set terms with the collections already\r\nexisting in Cambridge, its purpose was well understood; and Mr.\r\nGray's nephew, Mr. William Gray, acting upon the intention of his\r\nuncle as residuary legatee, gave it into the hands of the President\r\nand Fellows of Harvard University. In passing over this trust, the\r\nfollowing condition, among others, was made, namely: \"That neither\r\nthe collections nor any building which may contain the same shall\r\never be designated by any other name than the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology at Harvard.\" This is worth noting, because the title was\r\nchosen and insisted upon by Agassiz himself in opposition to many\r\nwho would have had it called after him. To such honor as might be\r\nfound in connecting his own name with a public undertaking of any\r\nkind he was absolutely indifferent. It was characteristic of him to\r\nwish, on the contrary, that the name should be as impersonal and as\r\ncomprehensive as the uses and aims of the institution itself. Yet\r\nhe could not wholly escape the distinction he deprecated. The\r\npopular imagination, identifying him with his work, has\r\nre-christened the institution; and, spite of its legal title, its\r\nfamiliar designation is almost invariably the \"Agassiz Museum.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gray's legacy started a movement which became every day more\r\nactive and successful. The university followed up his bequest by a\r\ngrant of land suitable for the site of the building, and since the\r\nGray fund provided for no edifice, an appeal was made to the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts to make good that deficiency. The\r\nLegislature granted lands to the amount of one hundred thousand\r\ndollars, on condition that a certain additional contribution should\r\nbe made by private subscription. The sum of seventy-one thousand\r\none hundred and twenty-five dollars, somewhat exceeding that\r\nstipulated, was promptly subscribed, chiefly by citizens of Boston\r\nand Cambridge, and Agassiz himself gave all the collections he had\r\nbrought together during the last four or five years, estimated,\r\nmerely by the outlay made upon them, at ten thousand dollars. The\r\narchitects, Mr. Henry Greenough and Mr. George Snell, offered the\r\nplan as their contribution. The former had long been familiar with\r\nAgassiz's views respecting the internal arrangements of the\r\nbuilding. The main features had been discussed between them, and\r\nnow, that the opportunity offered, the plan was practically ready\r\nfor execution. These events followed each other so rapidly that\r\nalthough Mr. Gray's bequest was announced only in December, 1858,\r\nthe first sod was turned and the corner-stone of the future Museum\r\nwas laid on a sunny afternoon in the following June, 1859.* (* The\r\nplan, made with reference to the future increase as well as the\r\npresent needs of the Museum, included a main building 364 feet in\r\nlength by 64 in width, with wings 205 feet in length by 64 in\r\nwidth, the whole enclosing a hollow square. The structure erected\r\n1859-60 was but a section of the north wing, being two fifths of\r\nits whole length. This gave ample space at the time for the\r\nimmediate requirements of the Museum. Additions have since been\r\nmade, and the north wing is completed, while the Peabody Museum\r\noccupies a portion of the ground allotted to the south wing.)\r\n\r\nThis event, so full of significance for Agassiz, took place a few\r\ndays before he sailed for Europe, having determined to devote the\r\nfew weeks of the college and school vacation to a flying visit in\r\nSwitzerland. The incidents of this visit were of a wholly domestic\r\nnature and hardly belong here. He paused a few days in Ireland and\r\nEngland to see his old friends, the Earl of Enniskillen and Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton, and review their collections. A day or two in\r\nLondon gave him, in like manner, a few hours at the British Museum,\r\na day with Owen at Richmond, and an opportunity to greet old\r\nfriends and colleagues called together to meet him at Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison's. He allowed himself also a week in Paris, made\r\ndelightful by the cordiality and hospitality of the professors of\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes, and by the welcome he received at the\r\nAcademy, when he made his appearance there. The happiest hours of\r\nthis brief sojourn in Paris were perhaps spent with his old and\r\ndear friend Valenciennes, the associate of earlier days in Paris,\r\nwhen the presence of Cuvier and Humboldt gave a crowning interest\r\nto scientific work there.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris he hastened on to his mother in Switzerland, devoting to\r\nher and to his immediate family all the time which remained to him\r\nbefore returning to his duties in Cambridge. They were very happy\r\nweeks, passed, for the most part, in absolute retirement, at\r\nMontagny, near the foot of the Jura, where Madame Agassiz was then\r\nresiding with her daughter. The days were chiefly spent in an\r\nold-fashioned garden, where a corner shut in by ivy and shaded by\r\ntrees made a pleasant out-of-door sitting-room. There he told his\r\nmother, as he had never been able to tell her in letters, of his\r\nlife and home in the United States, and of the Museum to which he\r\nwas returning, and which was to give him the means of doing for the\r\nstudy of nature all he had ever hoped to accomplish. His quiet stay\r\nhere was interrupted only by a visit of a few days to his sister at\r\nLausanne, and a trip to the Diablerets, where his brother, then a\r\ngreat invalid, was staying. He also passed a day or two at Geneva,\r\nwhere he was called to a meeting of the Helvetic Society, which\r\ngave him an opportunity of renewing old ties of friendship, as well\r\nas scientific relations, with the naturalists of his own country,\r\nwith Pictet de la Rive, de Candolle, Favre, and others.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\n1860-1863: AGE 53-56.\r\n\r\nReturn to Cambridge.\r\nRemoval of Collection to New Museum Building.\r\nDistribution of Work.\r\nRelations with his Students.\r\nBreaking out of the War between North and South.\r\nInterest of Agassiz in the Preservation of the Union.\r\nCommencement of Museum Publications.\r\nReception of Third and Fourth Volumes of \"Contributions.\"\r\nCopley Medal.\r\nGeneral Correspondence.\r\nLecturing Tour in the West.\r\nCircular Letter concerning Anthropological Collections.\r\nLetter to Mr. Ticknor concerning Geographical Distribution of Fishes\r\n   in Spain.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Cambridge at the end of September, Agassiz found\r\nthe Museum building well advanced. It was completed in the course\r\nof the next year, and the dedication took place on the 13th\r\nNovember, 1860. The transfer of the collections to their new and\r\nsafe abode was made as rapidly as possible, and the work of\r\ndeveloping the institution under these more favorable conditions\r\nmoved steadily on. The lecture rooms were at once opened, not only\r\nto students but to other persons not connected with the university.\r\nEspecially welcome were teachers of schools for whom admittance was\r\nfree. It was a great pleasure to Agassiz thus to renew and\r\nstrengthen his connection with the teachers of the State, with\r\nwhom, from the time of his arrival in this country, he had held\r\nmost cordial relations, attending the Teachers' Institutes,\r\nvisiting the normal schools, and associating himself actively, as\r\nfar as he could, with the interests of public education in\r\nMassachusetts. From this time forward his college lectures were\r\nopen to women as well as to men. He had great sympathy with the\r\ndesire of women for larger and more various fields of study and\r\nwork, and a certain number of women have always been employed as\r\nassistants at the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe story of the next three years was one of unceasing but\r\nseemingly uneventful work. The daylight hours from nine or ten\r\no'clock in the morning were spent, with the exception of the hour\r\ndevoted to the school, at the Museum, not only in personal\r\nresearches and in lecturing, but in organizing, distributing, and\r\nsuperintending the work of the laboratories, all of which was\r\ndirected by him. Passing from bench to bench, from table to table,\r\nwith a suggestion here, a kindly but scrutinizing glance there, he\r\nmade his sympathetic presence felt by the whole establishment. No\r\nman ever exercised a more genial personal influence over his\r\nstudents and assistants. His initiatory steps in teaching special\r\nstudents of natural history were not a little discouraging.\r\nObservation and comparison being in his opinion the intellectual\r\ntools most indispensable to the naturalist, his first lesson was\r\none in LOOKING. He gave no assistance; he simply left his student\r\nwith the specimen, telling him to use his eyes diligently, and\r\nreport upon what he saw. He returned from time to time to inquire\r\nafter the beginner's progress, but he never asked him a leading\r\nquestion, never pointed out a single feature of the structure,\r\nnever prompted an inference or a conclusion. This process lasted\r\nsometimes for days, the professor requiring the pupil not only to\r\ndistinguish the various parts of the animal, but to detect also the\r\nrelation of these details to more general typical features. His\r\nstudents still retain amusing reminiscences of their despair when\r\nthus confronted with their single specimen; no aid to be had from\r\noutside until they had wrung from it the secret of its structure.\r\nBut all of them have recognized the fact that this one lesson in\r\nlooking, which forced them to such careful scrutiny of the object\r\nbefore them, influenced all their subsequent habits of observation,\r\nwhatever field they might choose for their special subject of\r\nstudy. One of them who was intending to be an entomologist\r\nconcludes a very clever and entertaining account of such a first\r\nlesson, entirely devoted to a single fish, with these words: \"This\r\nwas the best entomological lesson I ever had,--a lesson whose\r\ninfluence has extended to the details of every subsequent study; a\r\nlegacy the professor has left to me, as he left it to many others,\r\nof inestimable value, which we could not buy, with which we could\r\nnot part.\"* (* \"In the Laboratory with Agassiz\", by S.H. Scudder.)\r\n\r\nBut if Agassiz, in order to develop independence and accuracy of\r\nobservation, threw his students on their own resources at first,\r\nthere was never a more generous teacher in the end than he. All his\r\nintellectual capital was thrown open to his pupils. His original\r\nmaterial, his unpublished investigations, his most precious\r\nspecimens, his drawings and illustrations were at their command.\r\nThis liberality led in itself to a serviceable training, for he\r\ntaught them to use with respect the valuable, often unique, objects\r\nintrusted to their care. Out of the intellectual good-fellowship\r\nwhich he established and encouraged in the laboratory grew the\r\nwarmest relations between his students and himself. Many of them\r\nwere deeply attached to him, and he was extremely dependent upon\r\ntheir sympathy and affection. By some among them he will never be\r\nforgotten. He is still their teacher and their friend, scarcely\r\nmore absent from their work now than when the glow of his\r\nenthusiasm made itself felt in his personal presence.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the distribution of his time in these busy days.\r\nHaving passed, as we have seen, the greater part of the day in the\r\nMuseum and the school, he had the hours of the night for writing,\r\nand rarely left his desk before one or two o'clock in the morning,\r\nor even later. His last two volumes of the \"Contributions,\" upon\r\nthe Acalephs, were completed during these years. In the mean time,\r\nthe war between North and South had broken out, and no American\r\ncared more than he for the preservation of the Union and the\r\ninstitutions it represented. He felt that the task of those who\r\nserved letters and science was to hold together the intellectual\r\naims and resources of the country during this struggle for national\r\nexistence, to fortify the strongholds of learning, abating nothing\r\nof their efficiency, but keeping their armories bright against the\r\nreturn of peace, when the better weapons of civilization should\r\nagain be in force. Toward this end he worked with renewed ardor,\r\nand while his friends urged him to suspend operations at the Museum\r\nand husband his resources until the storm should have passed over,\r\nhe, on the contrary, stimulated its progress by every means in his\r\npower. Occasionally he was assisted by the Legislature, and early\r\nin this period an additional grant of ten thousand dollars was made\r\nto the Museum. With this grant was begun the series of illustrated\r\npublications already mentioned, known as the \"Bulletin of the\r\nMuseum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this period he urged also the foundation of a National\r\nAcademy of Sciences, and was active in furthering its organization\r\nand incorporation (1863) by Congress. With respect to this effort,\r\nand to those he was at the same time making for the Museum, he was\r\nwont to recall the history of the University of Berlin. In an\r\nappeal to the people in behalf of the intellectual institutions of\r\nthe United States during the early years of the war he says: \"A\r\nwell known fact in the history of Germany has shown that the moment\r\nof political danger may be that in which the firmest foundations\r\nfor the intellectual strength of a country may be laid. When in\r\n1806, after the battle of Jena, the Prussian monarchy had been\r\ncrushed and the king was despairing even of the existence of his\r\nrealm, he planned the foundation of the University of Berlin, by\r\nthe advice of Fichte, the philosopher. It was inaugurated the very\r\nyear that the despondent monarch returned to his capital. Since\r\nthat time it has been the greatest glory of the Prussian crown, and\r\nhas made Berlin the intellectual centre of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added here as an evidence of Agassiz's faith in the\r\ninstitutions of the United States and in her intellectual progress\r\nthat he was himself naturalized in the darkest hour of the war,\r\nwhen the final disruption of the country was confidently prophesied\r\nby her enemies. By formally becoming a citizen of the United States\r\nhe desired to attest his personal confidence in the stability of\r\nher Constitution and the justice of her cause.\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown upon the work and incidents of these years by\r\nthe following letters:--\r\n\r\nFROM SIR PHILIP DE GREY EGERTON.\r\n\r\nLONDON, ALBEMARLE ST., April 16, 1861.\r\n\r\nMON CHER AGASS,* (* An affectionate abbreviation which Sir Philip\r\noften used for him.)\r\n\r\nI have this morning received your handsome and welcome present of\r\nthe third volume of your great undertaking, and this reminds me how\r\nremiss I have been in not writing to you sooner. In fact, I have\r\nhad nothing worth writing about, and I know your time is too\r\nvaluable to be intrenched upon by letters of mere gossip. I have\r\nnot of course had time to peruse any portion of the monograph, but\r\nI have turned over the pages and seen quite enough to sharpen my\r\nappetite for the glorious scientific feast you have so liberally\r\nprovided. And now that the weight is off your mind, I hope shortly\r\nto hear that you are about to fulfill this year the promise you\r\nmade of returning to England for a good long visit, only postponed\r\nby circumstances you could not have foreseen. Now that you have\r\nyour son as the sharer of your labors, you will be able to leave\r\nhim in charge during your absence, and so divest your mind of all\r\ncare and anxiety with reference to matters over the water. Here we\r\nare all fighting most furiously about Celts and flint implements,\r\nstruggle for life, natural selection, the age of the world, races\r\nof men, biblical dates, apes, and gorillas, etc., and the last duel\r\nhas been between Owen and Huxley on the anatomical distinction of\r\nthe pithecoid brain compared with that of man. Theological\r\ncontroversy has also been rife, stirred up by the \"Essays and\r\nReviews,\" of which you have no doubt heard much. For myself, I have\r\nbeen busy preparing, in conjunction with Huxley, another decade of\r\nfossil fishes, all from the old red of Scotland. . .Enniskillen is\r\nquite well. He is now at Lyme Regis. . .\r\n\r\nAt about this time the Copley Medal was awarded to Agassiz, a\r\ndistinction which was the subject of cordial congratulation from\r\nhis English friends.\r\n\r\nFROM SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.\r\n\r\nBELGRAVE SQUARE, March, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 14th February was a great surprise to me. I\r\nblamed myself for not writing you sooner than I did on the event\r\nwhich I had long been anxious to see realized; but I took it for\r\ngranted that you had long before received the official announcement\r\nfrom the foreign secretary that you were, at the last anniversary\r\nof the Royal Society, the recipient of the highest honor which our\r\nbody can bestow, whether on a foreigner or a native. . .On going to\r\nthe Royal Society to-day I found that the President and Secretaries\r\nwere much surprised that you had never answered the official letter\r\nsent to you on the 1st or 2nd December by the Foreign Secretary,\r\nProfessor Muller, of Cambridge. He wrote to announce the award, and\r\ntold you the Copley Medal was in his safe keeping till you wrote to\r\nsay what you wished to have done with it. I have now recommended\r\nhim to transmit it officially to you through the United States\r\nMinister, Mr. Adams. In these times of irritation, everything which\r\nsoothes and calms down angry feelings ought to be resorted to; and\r\nI hope it may be publicly known that when our newspapers were\r\nreciprocating all sorts of rudenesses, the men of science of\r\nEngland thought of nothing but honoring a beloved and eminent\r\nsavant of America.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your clear and manly view of the North and South,\r\nwhich I shall show to all our mutual friends. Egerton, who is now\r\nhere, was delighted to hear of you, as well as Huxley, Lyell, and\r\nmany others. . .\r\n\r\nIn a paper just read to the Geological Society Professor Ramsay has\r\nmade a stronger demand on the powers of ice than you ever did. He\r\nimagines that every Swiss lake north and south (Geneva, Neuchatel,\r\nComo, etc.) has been scooped out, and the depressions excavated by\r\nthe abrading action of the glaciers.\r\n\r\nFROM SIR PHILIP DE GREY EGERTON.\r\n\r\nALBEMARLE ST., LONDON, March 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nMON CHER AGASS,\r\n\r\nAs I am now settled in London for some months, I take the first\r\nopportunity of writing to congratulate you on the distinction which\r\nhas been conferred upon you by the Royal Society, and I will say\r\nthat you have most fully earned it. I rejoice exceedingly in the\r\ndecision the Council have arrived at. I only regret I was not on\r\nthe Council myself to have advocated your high claims and taken a\r\nshare in promoting your success. It is now long since I have heard\r\nfrom you, but this terrible disruption between the North and South\r\nhas, I suppose, rendered the pursuit of science rather difficult,\r\nand the necessary funds also difficult of attainment. I should like\r\nvery much to hear how you are getting on, and whether there is any\r\nlikelihood of your being able to come over in the course of the\r\nsummer or autumn. I fully expected you last year, and was very much\r\ndisappointed that you could not realize your intention. I have this\r\nday sent to you through Bailliere, the last decade of the Jermyn\r\nSt. publications.* (* Publications of the Geological Survey of\r\nEngland.) You will see that Huxley has taken up the subject of the\r\nDevonian fishes in a truly scientific spirit. . .\r\n\r\nFROM OWEN TO AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nBRITISH MUSEUM, August 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nI have received, and since its reception have devoted most of my\r\nspare moments to the study of, your fourth volume of the \"Natural\r\nHistory of the United States,\"--a noble contribution to our\r\nscience, and worthy of your great name.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the unity of plan pervading the diversities of\r\nthe Polyps, Hydroids, Acalephal and Echinodermal modifications of\r\nyour truly natural group of Radiates, is to my mind perfect, and I\r\ntrust that the harsh and ugly and essentially error-breeding name\r\nof Coelenterata may have received its final sentence of exile from\r\nlasting and rational zoological terminology.\r\n\r\nI shall avail myself of opportunities for bringing myself to your\r\nrecollection by such brochures as I have time for. One of them will\r\nopen to your view something of the nature of the contest here\r\nwaging to obtain for England a suitable Museum of Natural History,\r\nequivalent to her wealth and colonies and maritime business. In\r\nthis I find you a valuable ally, and have cited from the Reports of\r\nyour Museum of Comparative Zoology in support of my own claims for\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear from Mr. Bates that the Megatherium had not gone\r\nto the bottom, but had been rescued, and that it was probably ere\r\nthis in your Museum at Cambridge. I trust it may be so.\r\n\r\nA line from you or the sight of any friend of yours is always\r\ncheering to me. Our friends Enniskillen and Egerton are both\r\nwell. . .\r\n\r\nI remain ever truly yours,\r\n\r\nRICHARD OWEN.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen by a previous letter from Sir Roderick Murchison,\r\nAgassiz tried from time to time to give his English friends more\r\njust views of our national struggle. The letter to which the\r\nfollowing is an answer is missing, but one may easily infer its\r\ntenor, and the pleasure it had given him.\r\n\r\nTO SIR PHILIP DE GREY EGERTON.\r\n\r\nNAHANT, MASSACHUSETTS, August 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n. . .I feel so thankful for your words of sympathy, that I lose not\r\nan hour in expressing my feeling. It has been agonizing week after\r\nweek to receive the English papers, and to see there the noble\r\ndevotion of the men of the North to their country and its\r\ngovernment, branded as the service of mercenaries. You know I am\r\nnot much inclined to meddle with politics; but I can tell you that\r\nI have never seen a more generous and prompt response to the call\r\nof country than was exhibited last year, and is exhibiting now, in\r\nthe loyal United States. In the last six weeks nearly 300,000 men\r\nhave volunteered, and I am satisfied that the additional 300,000\r\nwill be forthcoming without a draft in the course of the next\r\nmonth. And believe me, it is not for the sake of the bounty they\r\ncome forward, for our best young men are the first to enlist; if\r\nanything can be objected to these large numbers of soldiers, it is\r\nthat it takes away the best material that the land possesses. I\r\nthank you once more for your warm sympathy. I needed it the more,\r\nas it is almost the first friendly word of that kind I have\r\nreceived from England, and I began to question the humanity of your\r\ncivilization. . .Under present circumstances, you can well imagine\r\nthat I cannot think of leaving Cambridge, even for a few weeks,\r\nmuch as I wish to take some rest, and especially to meet your kind\r\ninvitation. But I feel that I have a debt to pay to my adopted\r\ncountry, and all I can now do is to contribute my share toward\r\nmaintaining the scientific activity which has been awakened during\r\nthe last few years, and which even at this moment is on the\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nI am now at Nahant, on the sea-shore, studying embryology chiefly\r\nwith reference to paleontology, and the results are most\r\nsatisfactory. I have had an opportunity already of tracing the\r\ndevelopment of the representatives of three different families,\r\nupon the embryology of which we had not a single observation thus\r\nfar, and of making myself familiar with the growth of many others.\r\nWith these accessions I propose next winter seriously to return to\r\nmy first scientific love. . .\r\n\r\nI have taken with me to the sea-shore your and Huxley's\r\n\"Contributions to the Devonian Fishes,\" and also your notice of\r\nCarboniferous fish-fauna; but I have not yet had a chance to study\r\nthem critically, from want of time, having been too successful with\r\nthe living specimens to have a moment for the fossils. The season\r\nfor sea-shore studies is, however, drawing rapidly to an end, and\r\nthen I shall have more leisure for my old favorites.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear such accounts of the sufferings of the\r\nmanufacturing districts in England. I wish I could foretell the end\r\nof our conflict; but I do not believe it can now be ended before\r\nslavery is abolished, though I thought differently six months ago.\r\nThe most conservative men at the North have gradually come to this\r\nconviction, and nobody would listen for a moment to a compromise\r\nwith the southern slave power. Whether we shall get rid of it by\r\nwar measures or by an emancipation proclamation, I suppose the\r\nPresident himself does not yet know. I do not think that we shall\r\nwant more money than the people are willing to give. Private\r\ncontributions for the comfort of the army are really unbounded. I\r\nknow a gentleman, not among the richest in Boston, who has already\r\ncontributed over 30,000 dollars; and I heard yesterday of a\r\nshop-boy who tendered all his earnings of many years to the relief\r\ncommittee,--2,000 dollars, retaining NOTHING for himself,--and so\r\nit goes all round. Of course we have croakers and despondent\r\npeople, but they no longer dare to raise their voices; from which I\r\ninfer that there is no stopping the storm until by the natural\r\ncourse of events the atmosphere is clear and pure again.\r\n\r\nEver truly your friend,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nAgassiz had now his time more at his own disposal since he had\r\ngiven up his school and had completed also the fourth volume of his\r\n\"Contributions.\" Leisure time he could never be said to have, but\r\nhe was free to give all his spare time and strength to the Museum,\r\nand to this undivided aim, directly or indirectly, the remainder of\r\nhis life was devoted. Although at intervals he received generous\r\naid from the Legislature or from private individuals for the\r\nfurther development of the Museum, its growth outran such\r\nprovision, and especially during the years of the war the problem\r\nof meeting expenses was often difficult of solution. To provide for\r\nsuch a contingency Agassiz made in the winter of 1863 the most\r\nextensive lecturing tour he had ever undertaken, even in his\r\nbusiest lecturing days. He visited all the large cities and some of\r\nthe smaller towns from Buffalo to St. Louis. While very\r\nremunerative, and in many respects delightful, since he was\r\nreceived with the greatest cordiality, and lectured everywhere to\r\nenthusiastic crowds, this enterprise was, nevertheless, of doubtful\r\neconomy even for his scientific aims. Agassiz was but fifty-six,\r\nyet his fine constitution began to show a fatigue hardly justified\r\nby his years, and the state of his health was already a source of\r\nserious anxiety to his friends. He returned much exhausted, and\r\npassed the summer at Nahant, where the climate always benefited\r\nhim, while his laboratory afforded the best conditions for work. If\r\nthis summer home had a fault, it was its want of remoteness. He was\r\nalmost as much beset there, by the interruptions to which a man in\r\nhis position is liable, as in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nHis letters show how constantly during this nominal vacation his\r\nMuseum and its interests occupied his thoughts. One is to his\r\nbrother-in-law, Thomas G. Cary, whose residence was in San\r\nFrancisco, and who had been for years his most efficient aid in\r\nobtaining collections from the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS G. CARY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nDEAR TOM,\r\n\r\nFor many years past your aid in fostering the plans of the Museum\r\nin Cambridge has greatly facilitated the progress of that\r\nestablishment in everything relating to the Natural History of\r\nCalifornia, and now that it has become desirable to extend our\r\nscheme to objects which have thus far been neglected I make another\r\nappeal to you.\r\n\r\nEvery day the history of mankind is brought into more and more\r\nintimate connection with the natural history of the animal\r\ncreation, and it is now indispensable that we should organize an\r\nextensive collection to illustrate the natural history of the\r\nuncivilized races. Your personal acquaintance with business friends\r\nin almost every part of the globe has suggested to me the propriety\r\nof addressing to you a circular letter, setting forth the objects\r\nwanted, and requesting of you the favor to communicate it as widely\r\nas possible among your friends.\r\n\r\nTo make the most instructive collections relative to the natural\r\nhistory of mankind, two classes of specimens should be brought\r\ntogether, one concerning the habits and pursuits of the races, the\r\nother concerning the physical constitution of the races themselves.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the first it would be desirable to collect\r\narticles of clothing and ornaments of all the races of men, their\r\nimplements, tools, weapons, and such models or drawings of their\r\ndwellings as may give an idea of their construction; small canoes\r\nand oars as models of their vessels, or indications of their\r\nprogress in navigation; in one word, everything that relates to\r\ntheir avocations, their pursuits, their habits, their mode of\r\nworship, and whatever may indicate the dawn or progress of the arts\r\namong them. As to articles of clothing, it would be preferable to\r\nselect such specimens as have actually been worn or even cast off,\r\nrather than new things which may be more or less fanciful and not\r\nindicate the real natural condition and habits of a race.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the collections intended to illustrate the physical\r\nconstitution of the races it is more difficult to obtain\r\ninstructive specimens, as the savage races are generally inclined\r\nto hold sacred all that relates to their dead; yet whenever an\r\nopportunity is afforded to obtain skulls of the natives of\r\ndifferent parts of the world, it should be industriously improved,\r\nand good care taken to mark the skulls in such a way that their\r\norigin cannot be mistaken. Beside this, every possible effort\r\nshould be made to obtain perfect heads, preserved in alcohol, so\r\nthat all their features may be studied minutely and compared. Where\r\nthis cannot be done portraits or photographs may be substituted.\r\n\r\nTrusting that you may help me in this way to bring together in\r\nCambridge a more complete collection, illustrative of the natural\r\nhistory of mankind than exists thus far anywhere,* (* All the\r\nethnographical collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology\r\nhave now been transferred to the Peabody Museum, where they more\r\nproperly belong.)\r\n\r\nI remain, ever truly your friend and brother,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Mr. Ticknor is in the same spirit as\r\nprevious ones to Mr. Haldeman and others, concerning the\r\ndistribution of fishes in America. It is given at the risk of some\r\nrepetition, because it illustrates Agassiz's favorite idea that a\r\nkey to the original combination of faunae in any given system of\r\nfresh waters, might be reached through a closer study than has yet\r\nbeen possible of the geographical or local circumscription of their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nTO MR. GEORGE TICKNOR.\r\n\r\nNAHANT, October 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAmong the schemes which I have devised for the improvement of the\r\nMuseum, there is one for the realization of which I appeal to your\r\naid and sympathy. Thus far the natural productions of the rivers\r\nand lakes of the world have not been compared with one another,\r\nexcept what I have done in comparing the fishes of the Danube with\r\nthose of the Rhine and of the Rhone, and those of the great\r\nCanadian lakes with those of the Swiss lakes.\r\n\r\nI now propose to resume this subject on the most extensive scale,\r\nsince I see that it has the most direct bearing upon the\r\ntransmutation theory. . .First let me submit to you my plan.\r\n\r\nRivers and lakes are isolated by the land and sea from one another.\r\nThe question is, then, how they came to be peopled with inhabitants\r\ndiffering both from those on land and those in the sea, and how\r\ndoes it come that every hydrographic basin has its own inhabitants\r\nmore or less different from those of any other basin? Take the\r\nGanges, the Nile, and the Amazons. There is not a living being in\r\nthe one alike to any one in the others, etc. Now to advance the\r\ninvestigation to the point where it may tell with reference to the\r\nscientific doctrines at present under discussion, it is essential\r\nto know the facts in detail, with reference to every fresh-water\r\nbasin on earth. I have already taken means to obtain the tenants of\r\nall the rivers of Brazil, and partly of Russia, and I hope you may\r\nbe able to put me in the way of getting those of Spain, if not of\r\nsome other country beside. The plan I propose for that country\r\nwould be worthy of the Doctors of Salamanca in her brightest days.\r\nIf this alone were carried out, it would be, I believe, sufficient\r\nto settle the whole question.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to obtain separate collections from all the principal\r\nrivers of Spain and Portugal, and even to have several separate\r\ncollections from the larger rivers, one from their lower course,\r\none from their middle course, and another from their head-waters.\r\nTake, for instance, the Douro. One collection ought to be made at\r\nOporto, and several higher up, among its various tributaries and in\r\nits upper course; say, one at Zamora and Valladolid, one at\r\nSalamanca from the Tormes River, one at Leon from the Esla River,\r\none at Burgos and Palencia from the northern tributaries, one at\r\nSoria and Segovia from the southern tributaries. If this could be\r\ndone on such a scale as I propose, it would in itself be a work\r\nworthy of the Spanish government, and most creditable to any man\r\nwho should undertake it. The fact is that nothing of the kind has\r\never been done yet anywhere. A single collection from the Minho\r\nwould be sufficient, say from Orense or Melgaco. From the northern\r\nrivers along the gulf of Biscay all that would be necessary would\r\nbe one thoroughly complete collection from one of the little rivers\r\nthat come down from the mountains of Asturias, say from Oviedo.\r\n\r\nThe Ebro would require a more elaborate survey. From its upper\r\ncourse, one collection would be needed from Haro or Frias or\r\nMiranda; another from Saragossa, and one from its mouth, including\r\nthe minnows common among the brackish waters near the mouth of\r\nlarge rivers. In addition to this, one or two of the tributaries of\r\nthe Ebro, coming down from the Pyrenees, should be explored in the\r\nsame manner; say one collection from Pampeluna, and one from Urgel,\r\nor any other place on the southern slope of the Pyrenees. A\r\ncollection made at Barcelona from the river and the brackish\r\nmarshes would be equally desirable; another from the river at\r\nValencia, and, if possible, also from its head-waters at Ternel;\r\nanother from the river Segura at Murcia, and somewhere in the\r\nmountains from its head-waters. Granada would afford particular\r\ninterest as showing what its mountain streams feed. A collection\r\nfrom the Almeria River at Almeria, or from any of the small rivers\r\nof the southern coast of Spain, would do; and it would be the more\r\ninteresting if another from the river Xenil could be obtained at or\r\nnear Granada, to compare with the inhabitants of the waters upon\r\nthe southern slope of the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nNext would come the Guadalquivir, from which a collection should be\r\nmade at San Lucar, with the brackish water species; another at\r\nSeville or Cordova, one among the head-waters from the Sierra\r\nNevada, and another from the mountains of the Mancha. From the\r\nGuadiana a collection from Villa Real, with the brackish species;\r\none from Badajoz, and one from the easternmost headwaters, and\r\nabout where the river is lost under ground.\r\n\r\nThe Tagus would again require an extensive exploration. In the\r\nfirst place a thorough collection of all the species found in the\r\ngreat estuary ought to be made with the view of ascertaining how\r\nfar marine Atlantic species penetrate into the river basin; then\r\none from Santarem, and another either from Talavera or Toledo or\r\nAranjuez, and one from the head-waters in Guadalaxara, and another\r\nin Molina.\r\n\r\nThe collections made at different stations ought carefully to be\r\nkept in distinct jars or kegs, with labels so secure that no\r\nconfusion or mistake can arise. But the specimens collected at the\r\nsame station may be put together in the same jar. These collections\r\nrequire, in fact, very little care. (Here some details about mode\r\nof putting up specimens, transportation, etc.) If the same person\r\nshould collect upon different stations, either in the same or in\r\ndifferent hydrographic basins, the similarity of the specimens\r\nshould not be a reason for neglecting to preserve them. What is\r\naimed at is not to secure a variety of species, but to learn in\r\nwhat localities the same species may occur again and again, and\r\nwhat are the localities which nourish different species, no matter\r\nwhether these species are in themselves interesting or not, new to\r\nscience or known for ages, whether valuable for the table or unfit\r\nto eat. The mere fact of their distribution is the point to be\r\nascertained, and this, as you see, requires the most extensive\r\ncollections, affording in themselves comparatively little interest,\r\nbut likely to lead, by a proper discussion of the facts, to the\r\nmost unexpected philosophical results. . .Do, please, what you can\r\nin this matter. Spain alone might give us the materials to solve\r\nthe question of transmutation versus creation. I am going to make a\r\nsimilar appeal to my friends in Russia for materials from that\r\ncountry, including Siberia and Kamschatka. Our own rivers are not\r\neasily accessible now.\r\n\r\nEver truly your friend,\r\n\r\nL. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\n1863-1864: AGE 56-57.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with Dr. S.G. Howe.\r\nBearing of the War on the Position of the Negro Race.\r\nAffection for Harvard College.\r\nInterest in her General Progress.\r\nCorrespondence with Emerson concerning Harvard.\r\nGlacial Phenomena in Maine.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ'S letters give little idea of the deep interest he felt in\r\nthe war between North and South, and its probable issue with\r\nreference to the general policy of the nation, and especially to\r\nthe relation between the black and white races. Although any\r\njudgment upon the accuracy of its conclusions would now be\r\npremature, the following correspondence between Agassiz and Dr. S.\r\nG. Howe is nevertheless worth considering, as showing how the\r\nproblem presented itself to the philanthropist and the naturalist\r\nfrom their different stand-points.\r\n\r\nFROM DR. S.G. HOWE.\r\n\r\nPORTSMOUTH, August 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nYou will learn by a glance at the inclosed circular the object of\r\nthe commission of which I am a member.\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the subject to be examined and reported upon,\r\nthe more I am impressed by its vastness; the more I see that its\r\nproper treatment requires a consideration of political,\r\nphysiological, and ethnological principles. Before deciding upon\r\nany political policy, it is necessary to decide several important\r\nquestions, which require more knowledge for their solution than I\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nAmong these questions, this one occupies me most now. Is it\r\nprobable that the African race, represented by less than two\r\nmillion blacks and a little more than two million mulattoes,\r\nunrecruited by immigration, will be a persistent race in this\r\ncountry? or will it be absorbed, diluted, and finally effaced by\r\nthe white race, numbering twenty-four millions, and continually\r\nincreased by immigration, beside natural causes.\r\n\r\nWill not the general practical amalgamation fostered by slavery\r\nbecome more general after its abolition? If so, will not the\r\nproportion of mulattoes become greater and that of the pure blacks\r\nless? With an increase and final numerical prevalence of mulattoes\r\nthe question of the fertility of the latter becomes a very\r\nimportant element in the calculation. Can it be a persistent race\r\nhere where pure blacks are represented by 2, and the whites by\r\n20-24?\r\n\r\nIs it not true that in the Northern States at least the mulatto is\r\nunfertile, leaving but few children, and those mainly lymphatic and\r\nscrofulous?\r\n\r\nIn those sections where the blacks and mulattoes together make from\r\nseventy to eighty and even ninety per cent of the whole population\r\nwill there be, after the abolition of slavery, a sufficiently large\r\ninflux of whites to counteract the present numerical preponderance\r\nof blacks?\r\n\r\nIt looks now as if the whites would EXPLOITER the labors of the\r\nblacks, and that social servitude will continue long in spite of\r\npolitical equality.\r\n\r\nYou will see the importance of considering carefully the natural\r\nlaws of increase and their modification by existing causes before\r\ndeciding upon any line of policy.\r\n\r\nIf there be irresistible natural tendencies to the growth of a\r\npersistent black race in the Gulf and river States, we must not\r\nmake bad worse by futile attempts to resist it. If, on the other\r\nhand, the natural tendencies are to the diffusion and final\r\ndisappearance of the black (and colored) race, then our policy\r\nshould be modified accordingly.\r\n\r\nI should be very glad, my dear sir, if you could give me your views\r\nupon this and cognate matters. If, however, your occupations will\r\nnot permit you to give time to this matter, perhaps you will assist\r\nme by pointing to works calculated to throw light upon the subject\r\nof my inquiry, or by putting me in correspondence with persons who\r\nhave the ability and the leisure to write about it.\r\n\r\nI remain, dear sir, faithfully,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL G. HOWE.\r\n\r\nTO DR. S.G. HOWE.\r\n\r\nNAHANT, August 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nWhen I acknowledged a few days ago the receipt of your invitation\r\nto put in writing my views upon the management of the negro race as\r\npart of the free population of the United States, I stated to you\r\nthat there was a preliminary question of the utmost importance to\r\nbe examined first, since whatever convictions may be formed upon\r\nthat point must necessarily influence everything else relating to\r\nthe subject. The question is simply this: Is there to be a\r\npermanent black population upon the continent after slavery is\r\neverywhere abolished and no inducement remains to foster its\r\nincrease? Should this question be answered in the negative, it is\r\nevident that a wise policy would look to the best mode of removing\r\nthat race from these States, by the encouragement and acceleration\r\nof emigration. Should the question be answered, on the contrary, in\r\nthe affirmative, then it is plain that we have before us one of the\r\nmost difficult problems, upon the solution of which the welfare of\r\nour own race may in a measure depend, namely, the combination in\r\none social organization of two races more widely different from one\r\nanother than all the other races. In effecting this combination it\r\nbecomes our duty to avoid the recurrence of great evils, one of\r\nwhich is already foreshadowed in the advantage which unscrupulous\r\nmanagers are taking of the freedmen, whenever the latter are\r\nbrought into contact with new social relations.\r\n\r\nI will, for the present, consider only the case of the unmixed\r\nnegroes of the Southern States, the number of which I suppose to be\r\nabout two millions. It is certainly not less,--it may be a little\r\nmore. From whatever point of view you look upon these people you\r\nmust come to the conclusion that, left to themselves, they will\r\nperpetuate their race ad infinitum where they are. According to the\r\nprevalent theory of the unity of mankind it is assumed that the\r\ndifferent races have become what they are in consequence of their\r\nsettlement in different parts of the world, and that the whole\r\nglobe is everywhere a fit abode for human beings who adapt\r\nthemselves to the conditions under which they live. According to\r\nthe theory of a multiple origin of mankind the different races have\r\nfirst appeared in various parts of the globe, each with the\r\npeculiarities best suited to their primitive home. Aside from these\r\ntheoretical views the fact is, that some races inhabit very\r\nextensive tracts of the earth's surface, and are now found upon\r\nseparate continents, while others are very limited in their range.\r\nThis distribution is such that there is no reason for supposing\r\nthat the negro is less fitted permanently to occupy at least the\r\nwarmer parts of North and South America, than is the white race to\r\nretain possession of their more temperate portions. Assuming our\r\npure black race to be only two millions, it is yet larger than the\r\nwhole number of several races that have held uninterrupted\r\npossession of different parts of the globe ever since they have\r\nbeen known to the white race. Thus the Hottentots and the\r\nAbyssinians have maintained themselves in their respective homes\r\nwithout change ever since their existence has been known to us,\r\neven though their number is less than that of our pure black\r\npopulation. The same, also, is the case with the population of\r\nAustralia and of the Pacific islands. The Papuan race, the Negrillo\r\nrace, the Australian race proper, distinct from one another, as\r\nwell as from all other inhabitants of the earth, number each fewer\r\ninhabitants than already exist of the negro race in the United\r\nStates alone, not to speak of Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThis being the case there is, it seems to me, no more reason to\r\nexpect a disappearance of the negro race from the continent of\r\nAmerica without violent interference, than to expect a\r\ndisappearance of the races inhabiting respectively the South Sea\r\nIslands, Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, or any other part of the\r\nglobe tenanted by the less populous races. The case of the American\r\nIndians, who gradually disappear before the white race, should not\r\nmislead us, as it is readily accounted for by the peculiar\r\ncharacter of that race. The negro exhibits by nature a pliability,\r\na readiness to accommodate himself to circumstances, a proneness to\r\nimitate those among whom he lives,--characteristics which are\r\nentirely foreign to the Indian, while they facilitate in every way\r\nthe increase of the negro. I infer, therefore, from all these\r\ncircumstances that the negro race must be considered as permanently\r\nsettled upon this continent, no less firmly than the white race,\r\nand that it is our duty to look upon them as co-tenants in the\r\npossession of this part of the world.\r\n\r\nRemember that I have thus far presented the case only with\r\nreference to the Southern States, where the climate is particularly\r\nfavorable to the maintenance and multiplication of the negro race.\r\nBefore drawing any inference, however, from my first assertion that\r\nthe negro will easily and without foreign assistance maintain\r\nhimself and multiply in the warmer parts of this continent, let us\r\nconsider a few other features of this momentous question of race.\r\nWhites and blacks may multiply together, but their offspring is\r\nnever either white or black; it is always mulatto. It is a\r\nhalf-breed, and shares all the peculiarities of half-breeds, among\r\nwhose most important characteristics is their sterility, or at\r\nleast their reduced fecundity. This shows the connection to be\r\ncontrary to the normal state of the races, as it is contrary to the\r\npreservation of species in the animal kingdom. . .Far from\r\npresenting to me a natural solution of our difficulties, the idea\r\nof amalgamation is most repugnant to my feelings. It is now the\r\nfoundation of some of the most ill-advised schemes. But wherever it\r\nis practiced, amalgamation among different races produces shades of\r\npopulation, the social position of which can never be regular and\r\nsettled. From a physiological point of view, it is sound policy to\r\nput every possible obstacle to the crossing of the races, and the\r\nincrease of half-breeds. It is unnatural, as shown by their very\r\nconstitution, their sickly physique, and their impaired fecundity.\r\nIt is immoral and destructive of social equality as it creates\r\nunnatural relations and multiplies the differences among members of\r\nthe same community in a wrong direction.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is plain that the policy to be adopted toward the\r\nmiscellaneous colored population with reference to a more or less\r\ndistant future should be totally different from that which applies\r\nto the pure black; for while I believe that a wise social economy\r\nwill foster the progress of every pure race, according to its\r\nnatural dispositions and abilities, and aim at securing for it a\r\nproper field for the fullest development of all its capabilities, I\r\nam convinced also that no efforts should be spared to check that\r\nwhich is inconsistent with the progress of a higher civilization\r\nand a purer morality. I hope and trust that as soon as the\r\ncondition of the negro in the warmer parts of our States has been\r\nregulated according to the laws of freedom, the colored population\r\nin the more northern parts of the country will diminish. By a\r\nnatural consequence of unconquerable affinities, the colored people\r\nin whom the negro nature prevails will tend toward the South, while\r\nthe weaker and lighter ones will remain and die out among us.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these views upon the fundamental questions concerning\r\nthe races, the next point for consideration is the policy to be\r\nadopted under present circumstances, in order to increase the\r\namount of good which is within our grasp and lessen the evil which\r\nwe may avert. This will be for another letter.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nI am so deeply impressed with the dangers awaiting the progress of\r\ncivilization, should the ideas now generally prevalent about\r\namalgamation gain sufficient ascendancy to exert a practical\r\ninfluence upon the management of the affairs of the nation, that I\r\nbeg leave to urge a few more considerations upon that point.\r\n\r\nIn the first place let me insist upon the fact that the population\r\narising from the amalgamation of two races is always degenerate,\r\nthat it loses the excellences of both primitive stocks to retain\r\nthe vices or defects of both, and never to enjoy the physical vigor\r\nof either. In order clearly to appreciate the tendencies of\r\namalgamation, it is indispensable to discriminate correctly between\r\nthe differences distinguishing one race from another and those\r\nexisting between different nationalities of the same race. For\r\nwhile the mixture of nationalities of the same race has always\r\nproved beneficial as far as we are taught by history, the mixture\r\nof races has produced a very different result. We need only look at\r\nthe inhabitants of Central America, where the white, the negro, and\r\nthe Indian races are more or less blended, to see the baneful\r\neffects of such an amalgamation. The condition of the Indians on\r\nthe borders of civilization in the United States and in Canada, in\r\ntheir contact with the Anglo-Saxons as well as with the French,\r\ntestifies equally to the pernicious influence of amalgamation of\r\nraces. The experience of the Old World points in the same direction\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, in Australia; everywhere, in fact,\r\nhistory speaks as loudly in favor of the mixture of clearly related\r\nnations as she does in condemnation of the amalgamation of remote\r\nraces. We need only think of the origin of the English nation, of\r\nthat of the United States, etc. The question of breeding in-and-in,\r\nthat of marriage among close relations, is again quite distinct. In\r\nfact, there is hardly a more complicated subject in physiology, or\r\none requiring nicer discriminations, than that of the\r\nmultiplication of man, and yet it is constantly acted upon as if it\r\nneeded no special knowledge. I beseech you, therefore, while you\r\nare in a position to exert a leading influence in the councils of\r\nthe nation upon this most important subject to allow no\r\npreconceived view, no favorite schemes, no immediate object, to\r\nbias your judgment and mislead you. I do not pretend to be in\r\npossession of absolute truth. I only urge upon you the\r\nconsideration of unquestionable facts before you form a final\r\nopinion and decide upon a fixed policy. Conceive for a moment the\r\ndifference it would make in future ages for the prospects of\r\nrepublican institutions, and our civilization generally, if instead\r\nof the manly population descended from cognate nations the United\r\nStates should be inhabited by the effeminate progeny of mixed\r\nraces, half Indian, half negro, sprinkled with white blood. Can you\r\ndevise a scheme to rescue the Spaniards of Mexico from their\r\ndegradation? Beware, then, of any policy which may bring our own\r\nrace to their level.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead me naturally to the inquiry into the\r\npeculiarities of the two races, in order to find out what may be\r\nmost beneficial for each. I rejoice in the prospect of universal\r\nemancipation, not only from a philanthropic point of view, but also\r\nbecause hereafter the physiologist and ethnographer may discuss the\r\nquestion of the races and advocate a discriminating policy\r\nregarding them, without seeming to support legal inequality. There\r\nis no more one-sided doctrine concerning human nature than the idea\r\nthat all men are equal, in the sense of being equally capable of\r\nfostering human progress and advancing civilization, especially in\r\nthe various spheres of intellectual and moral activity. If this be\r\nso, then it is one of our primary obligations to remove every\r\nobstacle that may retard the highest development, while it is\r\nequally our duty to promote the humblest aspirations that may\r\ncontribute to raise the lowest individual to a better condition in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe question is, then, what kind of common treatment is likely to\r\nbe the best for all men, and what do the different races, taken\r\nsingly, require for themselves? That legal equality should be the\r\ncommon boon of humanity can hardly be matter for doubt nowadays,\r\nbut it does not follow that social equality is a necessary\r\ncomplement of legal equality. I say purposely legal equality, and\r\nnot political equality, because political equality involves an\r\nequal right to every public station in life, and I trust we shall\r\nbe wise enough not to complicate at once our whole system with new\r\nconflicting interests, before we have ascertained what may be the\r\npractical working of universal freedom and legal equality for two\r\nraces, so different as the whites and negroes, living under one\r\ngovernment. We ought to remember that what we know of the negro,\r\nfrom the experience we have had of the colored population of the\r\nNorth, affords but a very inadequate standard by which to judge of\r\nthe capabilities of the pure blacks as they exist in the South. We\r\nought, further, to remember that the black population is likely at\r\nall times to outnumber the white in the Southern States. We should\r\ntherefore beware how we give to the blacks rights, by virtue of\r\nwhich they may endanger the progress of the whites before their\r\ntemper has been tested by a prolonged experience. Social equality I\r\ndeem at all times impracticable,--a natural impossibility, from the\r\nvery character of the negro race. Let us consider for a moment the\r\nnatural endowments of the negro race as they are manifested in\r\nhistory on their native continent, as far as we can trace them\r\nback, and compare the result with what we know of our own\r\ndestinies, in order to ascertain, within the limits of probability,\r\nwhether social equality with the negro is really an impossibility.\r\n\r\nWe know of the existence of the negro race, with all its physical\r\npeculiarities, from the Egyptian monuments, several thousand years\r\nbefore the Christian era. Upon these monuments the negroes are so\r\nrepresented as to show that in natural propensities and mental\r\nabilities they were pretty much what we find them at the present\r\nday,--indolent, playful, sensual, imitative, subservient,\r\ngood-natured, versatile, unsteady in their purpose, devoted and\r\naffectionate. From this picture I exclude the character of the\r\nhalf-breeds, who have, more or less, the character of their white\r\nparents. Originally found in Africa, the negroes seem at all times\r\nto have presented the same characteristics wherever they have been\r\nbrought into contact with the white race; as in Upper Egypt, along\r\nthe borders of the Carthaginian and Roman settlements in Africa, in\r\nSenegal in juxtaposition with the French, in Congo in juxtaposition\r\nwith the Portuguese, about the Cape and on the eastern coast of\r\nAfrica in juxtaposition with the Dutch and the English. While Egypt\r\nand Carthage grew into powerful empires and attained a high degree\r\nof civilization; while in Babylon, Syria, and Greece were developed\r\nthe highest culture of antiquity, the negro race groped in\r\nbarbarism and NEVER ORIGINATED A REGULAR ORGANIZATION AMONG\r\nTHEMSELVES. This is important to keep in mind, and to urge upon the\r\nattention of those who ascribe the condition of the modern negro\r\nwholly to the influence of slavery. I do not mean to say that\r\nslavery is a necessary condition for the organization of the negro\r\nrace. Far from it. They are entitled to their freedom, to the\r\nregulation of their own destiny, to the enjoyment of their life, of\r\ntheir earnings, of their family circle. But with all this nowhere\r\ndo they appear to have been capable of rising, by themselves, to\r\nthe level of the civilized communities of the whites, and therefore\r\nI hold that they are incapable of living on a footing of social\r\nequality with the whites in one and the same community without\r\nbecoming an element of social disorder.* (* I fear the expression\r\n\"social equality\" may be misunderstood in this connection. It means\r\nhere only the relations which would arise from the mixture of the\r\ntwo races, and thus affect the organization of society as a whole.\r\nIt does not refer to any superficial or local social rules, such as\r\nsharing on common ground public conveyances, public accommodations,\r\nand the like.--ED.)\r\n\r\nI am not prepared to state what political privileges they are fit\r\nto enjoy now; though I have no hesitation in saying that they\r\nshould be equal to other men before the law. The right of owning\r\nproperty, of bearing witness, of entering into contracts, of buying\r\nand selling, of choosing their own domicile, would give them ample\r\nopportunity of showing in a comparatively short time what political\r\nrights might properly and safely be granted to them in successive\r\ninstallments. No man has a right to what he is unfit to use. Our\r\nown best rights have been acquired successively. I cannot,\r\ntherefore, think it just or safe to grant at once to the negro all\r\nthe privileges which we ourselves have acquired by long struggles.\r\nHistory teaches us what terrible reactions have followed too\r\nextensive and too rapid changes. Let us beware of granting too much\r\nto the negro race in the beginning, lest it become necessary\r\nhereafter to deprive them of some of the privileges which they may\r\nuse to their own and our detriment. All this I urge with reference\r\nto the pure blacks of the South. As to the half-breeds, especially\r\nin the Northern States, I have already stated it to be my opinion\r\nthat their very existence is likely to be only transient, and that\r\nall legislation with reference to them should be regulated with\r\nthis view, and so ordained as to accelerate their disappearance\r\nfrom the Northern States.\r\n\r\nLet me now sum up my answer to some of your direct questions.\r\n\r\n1st. Is it probable that the African race will be a persistent race\r\nin this country, or will it be absorbed, diluted, and finally\r\neffaced by the white race?\r\n\r\nI believe it will continue in the Southern States, and I hope it\r\nmay gradually die out at the North, where it has only an artificial\r\nfoothold, being chiefly represented by half-breeds, who do not\r\nconstitute a race by themselves.\r\n\r\n2nd. Will not the practical amalgamation fostered by slavery become\r\nmore general after its abolition?\r\n\r\nBeing the result of the vices engendered by slavery, it is to be\r\nhoped that the emancipation of the blacks, by securing to them a\r\nlegal recognition of their natural ties, will tend to diminish this\r\nunnatural amalgamation and lessen everywhere the number of these\r\nunfortunate half-breeds. My reason for believing that the colored\r\npopulation of the North will gradually vanish is founded in great\r\ndegree upon the fact that that population does not increase where\r\nit exists now, but is constantly recruited by an influx from the\r\nSouth. The southern half-breeds feel their false position at the\r\nSouth more keenly than the blacks, and are more inclined to escape\r\nto the North than the individuals of purer black blood. Remove the\r\noppression under which the colored population now suffers, and the\r\ncurrent will at once be reversed; blacks and mulattoes of the North\r\nwill seek the sunny South. But I see no cause which should check\r\nthe increase of the black population in the Southern States. The\r\nclimate is genial to them; the soil rewards the slightest labor\r\nwith a rich harvest. The country cannot well be cultivated without\r\nreal or fancied danger to the white man, who, therefore, will not\r\nprobably compete with the black in the labors of the field, thus\r\nleaving to him an opportunity for easy and desirable support.\r\n\r\n3rd. In those sections where the blacks and mulattoes together make\r\nfrom seventy to eighty and even ninety per cent of the population\r\nwill there be, after the abolition of slavery, a sufficiently large\r\ninflux of whites to counteract the present numerical preponderance\r\nof blacks?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question correctly we must take into consideration\r\nthe mode of distribution of the white and of the colored population\r\nin the more Southern States. The whites inhabit invariably the\r\nsea-shores and the more elevated grounds, while the blacks are\r\nscattered over the lowlands. This peculiar localization is rendered\r\nnecessary by the physical constitution of the country. The lowlands\r\nare not habitable in summer by the whites between sunset and\r\nsunrise. All the wealthy whites, and in the less healthy regions\r\neven the overseers, repair in the evening to the sea-shore or to\r\nthe woodlands, and return only in the morning to the plantation,\r\nexcept during the winter months, after the first hard frost, when\r\nthe country is everywhere habitable by all. This necessarily limits\r\nthe area which can be tenanted by the whites, and in some States\r\nthat area is very small as compared with that habitable by the\r\nblacks. It is therefore clear that with a free black population,\r\nenjoying identical rights with the whites, these States will sooner\r\nor later become negro States, with a comparatively small white\r\npopulation. This is inevitable; we might as soon expect to change\r\nthe laws of nature as to avert this result. I believe it may in a\r\ncertain sense work well in the end. But any policy based upon\r\ndifferent expectations is doomed to disappointment.\r\n\r\n4th. How to prevent the whites from securing the lion's share of\r\nthe labor of the blacks?\r\n\r\nThis is a question which my want of familiarity with the operations\r\nof the laboring classes prevents me from answering in a manner\r\nsatisfactory to myself. Is it not possible to apply to the\r\nsuperintendence of the working negroes something like the system\r\nwhich regulates the duties of the foreman in all our manufacturing\r\nestablishments?\r\n\r\nI should like to go on and attempt to devise some scheme in\r\nconformity with the convictions I have expressed in these letters.\r\nBut I have little ability in the way of organizing, and then the\r\nsubject is so novel that I am not prepared to propose anything very\r\ndefinite.\r\n\r\nEver truly yours,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFROM DR. S.G. HOWE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, August 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from expressing my thanks for your prompt\r\ncompliance with my request, and for your two valuable letters.\r\n\r\nBe assured I shall try to keep my mind open to conviction and to\r\nforbear forming any theory before observing a wide circle of facts.\r\nI do not know how you got the idea that I had decided in favor of\r\nanything about the future of the colored population. I have\r\ncorresponded with the founders of \"La Societe Cosmopolite pour la\r\nfusion des races humaines\" in France,--an amalgamation society,\r\nfounded upon the theory that the perfect man is to be the result of\r\nthe fusion of all the races upon earth. I have not, however, the\r\nhonor of being a member thereof. Indeed, I think it hardly exists.\r\nI hear, too, that several of our prominent anti-slavery gentlemen,\r\nworthy of respect for their zeal and ability, have publicly\r\nadvocated the doctrines of amalgamation; but I do not know upon\r\nwhat grounds.\r\n\r\nI do, indeed, hold that in this, as in other matters, we are to do\r\nthe manifest right, regardless of consequences. If you ask me who\r\nis to decide what is the manifest right, I answer, that in morals,\r\nas well as in mathematics, there are certain truths so simple as to\r\nbe admitted at sight as axioms by every one of common intelligence\r\nand honesty. The right to life is as clear as that two and two make\r\nfour, and none dispute it. The right to liberty and to ownership of\r\nproperty fairly earned is just as clear to the enlightened mind as\r\nthat 5 x 6 = 30; but the less enlightened may require to reflect\r\nabout it, just as they may want concrete signs to show that five\r\ntimes six do really make thirty. As we ascend in numbers and in\r\nmorals, the intuitive perceptions become less and less; and though\r\nthe truths are there, and ought to be admitted as axiomatic, they\r\nare not at once seen and felt by ordinary minds.\r\n\r\nNow so far as the rights of blacks and the duties of whites are\r\nmanifest to common and honest minds, so far would I admit the first\r\nand perform the second, though the heavens fall. I would not only\r\nadvocate entire freedom, equal rights and privileges, and open\r\ncompetition for social distinction, but what now seems to me the\r\nshocking and downward policy of amalgamation. But the heavens are\r\nnot going to fall, and we are not going to be called upon to favor\r\nany policy discordant with natural instincts and cultivated tastes.\r\n\r\nA case may be supposed in which the higher race ought to submit to\r\nthe sad fate of dilution and debasement of its blood,--as on an\r\nisland, and where long continued wrong and suffering had to be\r\natoned for. But this is hardly conceivable, because, even in what\r\nseems punishment and atonement, the law of harmonious development\r\nstill rules. God does not punish wrong and violence done to one\r\npart of our nature, by requiring us to do wrong and violence to\r\nanother part. Even Nemesis wields rather a guiding-rod than a\r\nscourge. We need take no step backward, but only aside, to get\r\nsooner into the right path.\r\n\r\nSlavery has acted as a disturbing force in the development of our\r\nnational character and produced monstrous deformities of a bodily\r\nas well as moral nature, for it has impaired the purity and lowered\r\nthe quality of the national blood. It imported Africans, and, to\r\nprevent their extinction by competition with a more vigorous race,\r\nit set a high premium on colored blood. It has fostered and\r\nmultiplied a vigorous black race, and engendered a feeble mulatto\r\nbreed. Many of each of these classes have drifted northward, right\r\nin the teeth of thermal laws, to find homes where they would never\r\nlive by natural election. Now, by utterly rooting out slavery, and\r\nby that means alone, shall we remove these disturbing forces and\r\nallow fair play to natural laws, by the operation of which, it\r\nseems to me, the colored population will disappear from the\r\nNorthern and Middle States, if not from the continent, before the\r\nmore vigorous and prolific white race. It will be the duty of the\r\nstatesman to favor, by wise measures, the operation of these laws\r\nand the purification and elevation of the national blood.\r\n\r\nIn the way of this is the existence of the colored population of\r\nthe Northern and Middle States. Now, while we should grant to every\r\nhuman being all the rights we claim for ourselves, and bear in mind\r\nthe cases of individual excellence of colored people, we must, I\r\nthink, admit that mulattoism is hybridism, and that it is unnatural\r\nand undesirable. It has been brought to its present formidable\r\nproportions by several causes,--mainly by slavery. Its evils are to\r\nbe met and lessened as far as may be, by wise statesmanship and by\r\nenlightenment of public opinion. These may do much.\r\n\r\nSome proclaim amalgamation as the remedy, upon the theory that by\r\ndiluting black blood with white blood in larger and larger\r\nproportions, it will finally be so far diluted as to be\r\nimperceptible and will disappear. They forget that we may not do\r\nthe wrong that right may come of it. They forget that no amount of\r\ndiffusion will exterminate whatever exists; that a pint of ink\r\ndiffused in a lake is still there, and the water is only the less\r\npure.\r\n\r\nOthers persist that mulattoism is not and cannot be persistent\r\nbeyond four generations. In other words, that like some other\r\nabnormal and diseased conditions it is self-limiting, and that the\r\nbody social will be purged of it.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these and other theories, it is our duty to gather\r\nas many facts and as much knowledge as is possible, in order to\r\nthrow light upon every part of the subject; nobody can furnish more\r\nthan you can.\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL G. HOWE.* (* In this correspondence with Dr. Howe, one or\r\ntwo phrases in Agassiz's letters are interpolated from a third\r\nunfinished letter, which was never forwarded to Dr. Howe. These\r\nsentences connect themselves so directly with the sense of the\r\nprevious letters that it seemed worth while to add them.--ED.)\r\n\r\nThe Museum and his own more immediate scientific work must\r\nnaturally take precedence in any biography of Agassiz, and perhaps,\r\nfor this reason, too little prominence has been given in these\r\npages to his interest in general education, and especially in the\r\ngeneral welfare and progress of Harvard College. He was deeply\r\nattached to the University with which he had identified himself in\r\nAmerica. While he strained every nerve to develop his own\r\nscientific department, which had no existence at Harvard until his\r\nadvent there, no one of her professors was more concerned than\r\nhimself for the organization of the college as a whole. A lover of\r\nletters as well as a devotee of nature, he valued every provision\r\nfor a well proportioned intellectual training. He welcomed the\r\ncreation of an Academic Council for the promotion of free and\r\nfrequent interchange of opinion between the different heads of\r\ndepartments, and, when in Cambridge, he was never absent from the\r\nmeetings. He urged, also, the introduction of university lectures,\r\nto the establishment of which he largely contributed, and which he\r\nwould fain have opened to all the students. He advocated the\r\nextension of the elective system, believing that while it might\r\nperhaps give a pretext for easy evasion of duty to the more\r\ninefficient and lazy students, it gave larger opportunities to the\r\nbetter class, and that the University should adapt itself to the\r\nlatter rather than the former. \"The bright students,\" he writes to\r\na friend, \"are now deprived of the best advantages to be had here,\r\nbecause the dull or the indifferent must still be treated as\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nThe two following letters, from their bearing on general university\r\nquestions, are not out of place here. Though occasioned by a slight\r\nmisconception, they are so characteristic of the writers, and of\r\ntheir relation to each other, that it would be a pity to omit them.\r\n\r\nTO RALPH WALDO EMERSON.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR EMERSON,\r\n\r\nIf your lecture on universities, the first of your course, has been\r\ncorrectly reported to me, I am almost inclined to quarrel with you\r\nfor having missed an excellent chance to help me, and advance the\r\ntrue interests of the college. You say that Natural History is\r\ngetting too great an ascendancy among us, that it is out of\r\nproportion to other departments, and hint that a check-rein would\r\nnot be amiss on the enthusiastic professor who is responsible for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nDo you not see that the way to bring about a well-proportioned\r\ndevelopment of all the resources of the University is not to check\r\nthe natural history department, but to stimulate all the others?\r\nnot that the zoological school grows too fast, but that the others\r\ndo not grow fast enough? This sounds invidious and perhaps somewhat\r\nboastful; but it is you and not I who have instituted the\r\ncomparison. It strikes me you have not hit upon the best remedy for\r\nthis want of balance. If symmetry is to be obtained by cutting down\r\nthe most vigorous growth, it seems to me it would be better to have\r\na little irregularity here and there. In stimulating, by every\r\nmeans in my power, the growth of the Museum and the means of\r\neducation connected with it, I am far from having a selfish wish to\r\nsee my own department tower above the others. I wish that every one\r\nof my colleagues would make it hard for me to keep up with him, and\r\nthere are some among them, I am happy to say, who are ready to run\r\na race with me. Perhaps, after all, I am taking up the cudgels\r\nagainst you rather prematurely. If I had not been called to New\r\nHaven, Sunday before last, by Professor Silliman's funeral, I\r\nshould have been present at your lecture myself. Having missed it,\r\nI may have heard this passage inaccurately repeated. If so, you\r\nmust forgive me, and believe me always, whatever you did or did not\r\nsay,\r\n\r\nEver truly your friend,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFROM RALPH WALDO EMERSON.\r\n\r\nCONCORD, December 13, 1864.\r\n\r\nDEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nI pray you have no fear that I did, or can, say any word unfriendly\r\nto you or to the Museum, for both of which blessings--the cause and\r\nthe effect--I daily thank Heaven! May you both increase and\r\nmultiply for ages!\r\n\r\nI cannot defend my lectures,--they are prone to be clumsy and\r\nhurried botches,--still less answer for any report,--which I never\r\ndare read; but I can tell you the amount of my chiding. I vented\r\nsome of the old grudge I owe the college now for forty-five years,\r\nfor the cruel waste of two years of college time on mathematics\r\nwithout any attempt to adapt, by skillful tutors, or by private\r\ninstruction, these tasks to the capacity of slow learners. I still\r\nremember the useless pains I took, and my serious recourse to my\r\ntutor for aid which he did not know how to give me. And now I see\r\nto-day the same indiscriminate imposing of mathematics on all\r\nstudents during two years,--ear or no ear, you shall all learn\r\nmusic,--to the waste of time and health of a large part of every\r\nclass. It is both natural and laudable in each professor to magnify\r\nhis department, and to seek to make it the first in the world if he\r\ncan. But of course this tendency must be corrected by securing in\r\nthe constitution of the college a power in the head (whether\r\nsingular or plural) of coordinating all the parts. Else, important\r\ndepartments will be overlaid, as in Oxford and in Harvard, natural\r\nhistory was until now. Now, it looks as if natural history would\r\nobtain in time to come the like predominance as mathematics have\r\nhere, or Greek at Oxford. It will not grieve me if it should, for\r\nwe are all curious of nature, but not of algebra. But the necessity\r\nof check on the instructors in the head of the college, I am sure\r\nyou will agree with me, is indispensable. You will see that my\r\nallusion to naturalists is only incidental to my statement of my\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\nBut I have made my letter ridiculously long, and pray you to\r\nremember that you have brought it on your own head. I do not know\r\nthat I ever attempted before an explanation of any speech.\r\n\r\nAlways with entire regard yours,\r\n\r\nR.W. EMERSON.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, in September, 1864, Agassiz made an excursion\r\ninto Maine, partly to examine the drift phenomena on the islands\r\nand coast of that State, and partly to study the so-called\r\n\"horse-backs.\" The journey proved to be one of the most interesting\r\nhe had made in this country with reference to local glacial\r\nphenomena. Compass in hand, he followed the extraordinary ridges of\r\nmorainic material lying between Bangor and Katahdin, to the Ebeene\r\nMountains, at the foot of which are the Katahdin Iron Works.\r\nReturning to Bangor, he pursued, with the same minute\r\ninvestigation, the glacial tracks and erratic material from that\r\nplace to the seacoast and to Mount Desert. The details of this\r\njourney and its results are given in one of the papers contained in\r\nthe second volume of his \"Geological Sketches.\" In conclusion, he\r\nsays; \"I suppose these facts must be far less expressive to the\r\ngeneral observer than to one who has seen this whole set of\r\nphenomena in active operation. To me they have been for many years\r\nso familiar in the Alpine valleys, and their aspect in those\r\nregions is so identical with the facts above described, that\r\nparadoxical as the statement may seem, the presence of the ice is\r\nnow an unimportant element to me in the study of glacial phenomena;\r\nno more essential than is the flesh to the anatomist who studies\r\nthe skeleton of a fossil animal.\"\r\n\r\nThis journey in Maine, undertaken in the most beautiful season of\r\nthe American year, when the autumn glow lined the forest roads with\r\nred and gold, was a great refreshment to Agassiz. He had been far\r\nfrom well, but he returned to his winter's work invigorated and\r\nwith a new sense of hope and courage.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21.\r\n\r\n1865-1868: AGE 58-61.\r\n\r\nLetter to his Mother announcing Journey to Brazil.\r\nSketch of Journey.\r\nKindness of the Emperor.\r\nLiberality of the Brazilian Government.\r\nCorrespondence with Charles Sumner.\r\nLetter to his Mother at Close of Brazil Journey.\r\nLetter from Martius concerning Journey in Brazil.\r\nReturn to Cambridge.\r\nLectures in Boston and New York.\r\nSummer at Nahant.\r\nLetter to Professor Peirce on the Survey of Boston Harbor.\r\nDeath of his Mother.\r\nIllness.\r\nCorrespondence with Oswald Heer.\r\nSummer Journey in the West.\r\nCornell University.\r\nLetter from Longfellow.\r\n\r\nTHE next important event in the life of Agassiz, due in the first\r\ninstance to his failing health, which made some change of scene and\r\nclimate necessary, is best announced by himself in the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 22, 1865.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER,\r\n\r\nYou will shed tears of joy when you read this, but such tears are\r\nharmless. Listen, then, to what has happened. A few weeks ago I was\r\nthinking how I should employ my summer. I foresaw that in going to\r\nNahant I should not find the rest I need after all the fatigue of\r\nthe two last years, or, at least, not enough of change and\r\nrelaxation. I felt that I must have new scenes to give me new life.\r\nBut where to go and what to do?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I wrote you last year of the many marks of kindness I have\r\nreceived from the Emperor of Brazil, and you remember that at the\r\ntime of my debut as an author, my attention was turned to the\r\nnatural history of that country. Lately, also, in a course of\r\nlectures at the Lowell Institute, I have been led to compare the\r\nAlps, where I have passed so many happy years, with the Andes,\r\nwhich I have never seen. In short, the idea came to me gradually,\r\nthat I might spend the summer at Rio de Janeiro, and that, with the\r\npresent facilities for travel, the journey would not be too\r\nfatiguing for my wife. . .Upon this, then, I had decided, when most\r\nunexpectedly, and as the consummation of all my wishes, my pleasure\r\ntrip was transformed into an important scientific expedition for\r\nthe benefit of the Museum, by the intervention of one of my\r\nfriends, Mr. Nathaniel Thayer. By chance I met him a week ago in\r\nBoston. He laughed at me a little about my roving disposition, and\r\nthen asked me what plans I had formed for the Museum, in connection\r\nwith my journey. I answered that, thinking especially of my health,\r\nI had provided only for the needs of myself and my wife during an\r\nabsence of six or eight months. Then ensued the following\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"But, Agassiz, that is hardly like you; you have never been away\r\nfrom Cambridge without thinking of your Museum.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough; but I am tired,--I need rest. I am going to loaf a\r\nlittle in Brazil.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have had a fortnight of that kind of thing you will be as\r\nready for work as ever, and you will be sorry that you have not\r\nmade some preparation to utilize the occasion and the localities in\r\nthe interest of the Museum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have some such misgiving; but I have no means for anything\r\nbeyond my personal expenses, and it is no time to ask sacrifices\r\nfrom any one in behalf of science. The country claims all our\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose some one offered you a scientific assistant, all\r\nexpenses paid, what would you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that I had never thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many assistants could you employ?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would be the expense of each one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose about twenty-five hundred dollars; at least, that is\r\nwhat I have counted upon for myself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's reflection he resumed:--\r\n\r\n\"If it suits you then, Agassiz, and interferes in no way with the\r\nplans for your health, choose your assistants among the employees\r\nof your Museum or elsewhere, and I will be responsible for all the\r\nscientific expenses of the expedition.\". . .\r\n\r\nMy preparations are made. I leave probably next week, from New\r\nYork, with a staff of assistants more numerous, and, I think, as\r\nwell chosen, as those of any previous undertaking of the kind.* (*\r\nBeside the six assistants provided for by Mr. Thayer, there were a\r\nnumber of young volunteer aids who did excellent work on the\r\nexpedition.)\r\n\r\n. . .All those who know me seem to have combined to heighten the\r\nattraction of the journey, and facilitate it in every respect. The\r\nPacific Mail Steamship Company has invited me to take passage with\r\nmy whole party on their fine steamer, the Colorado. They will take\r\nus, free of all expense, as far as Rio de Janeiro,--an economy of\r\nfifteen thousand francs at the start. Yesterday evening I received\r\na letter from the Secretary of the Navy, at Washington, desiring\r\nthe officers of all vessels of war stationed along the coasts I am\r\nto visit, to give me aid and support in everything concerning my\r\nexpedition. The letter was written in the kindest terms, and\r\ngratified me the more because it was quite unsolicited. I am really\r\ntouched by the marks of sympathy I receive, not only from near\r\nfriends, but even from strangers. . .I seem like the spoiled child\r\nof the country, and I hope God will give me strength to repay in\r\ndevotion to her institutions and to her scientific and intellectual\r\ndevelopment, all that her citizens have done for me.\r\n\r\nI am forgetting that you will be anxious to know what special work\r\nI propose to do in the interest of science in Brazil. First, I hope\r\nto make large collections of all such objects as properly belong in\r\na Museum of Natural History, and to this end I have chosen from\r\namong the employees of our Museum one representative from each\r\ndepartment. My only regret is that I must leave Alex in Cambridge\r\nto take care of the Museum itself. He will have an immense amount\r\nof work to do, for I leave him only six out of our usual staff of\r\nassistants. In the second place, I intend to make a special study\r\nof the habits, metamorphoses, anatomy, etc., of the Amazonian\r\nfishes. Finally, I dream sometimes of an ascension of the Andes, if\r\nI do not find myself too old and too heavy for climbing. I should\r\nlike to see if there were not also large glaciers in this chain of\r\nmountains, at the period when the glaciers of the Alps extended to\r\nthe Jura. . .But this latter part of my plan is quite uncertain,\r\nand must depend in great degree upon our success on the Amazons.\r\nAccompanied as I am with a number of aides naturalistes, we ought\r\nto be able among us to bring together large collections, and even\r\nto add duplicates, which I can then, on my return, distribute to\r\nthe European Museums, in exchange for valuable specimens.\r\n\r\nWe leave next week, and I hope to write you from Rio a letter which\r\nwill reach you about the date of my birthday. A steamer leaves\r\nBrazil once a month for England. If my arrival coincides with her\r\ndeparture you shall not be disappointed in this.\r\n\r\nWith all my heart,\r\n\r\nYOUR LOUIS.\r\n\r\nThe story of this expedition has been told in the partly\r\nscientific, partly personal diary published after Agassiz's return,\r\nunder the title of \"A Journey in Brazil,\" and therefore a full\r\naccount of it here would be mere repetition. He was absent sixteen\r\nmonths. The first three were spent in Rio de Janeiro, and in\r\nexcursions about the neighborhood of her beautiful bay and the\r\nsurrounding mountains. For greater efficiency and promptness he\r\ndivided his party into companies, each working separately, some in\r\ncollecting, others in geological surveys, but all under one\r\ncombined plan of action.\r\n\r\nThe next ten months were passed in the Amazonian region. This part\r\nof the journey had the charm of purely tropical scenery, and\r\nAgassiz, who was no less a lover of nature than a naturalist,\r\nenjoyed to the utmost its beauty and picturesqueness. Much of the\r\ntime he and his companions were living on the great river itself,\r\nand the deck of the steamer was by turns laboratory, dining-room,\r\nand dormitory. Often, as they passed close under the banks of the\r\nriver, or between the many islands which break its broad expanse\r\ninto narrow channels, their improvised working room was\r\novershadowed by the lofty wall of vegetation, which lifted its\r\ndense mass of trees and soft drapery of vines on either side. Still\r\nmore beautiful was it when they left the track of the main river\r\nfor the water-paths hidden in the forest. Here they were rowed by\r\nIndians in \"montarias,\" a peculiar kind of boat used by the\r\nnatives. It has a thatched hood at one end for shelter from rain or\r\nsun. Little sun penetrates, however, to the shaded \"igarape\"\r\n(boat-path), along which the montaria winds its way under a vault\r\nof green. When traveling in this manner, they stopped for the\r\nnight, and indeed sometimes lingered for days, in Indian\r\nsettlements, or in the more secluded single Indian lodges, which\r\nare to be found on the shores of almost every lake or channel. In\r\nthis net-work of fresh waters, threading the otherwise impenetrable\r\nwoods, the humblest habitation has its boat and landing-place. With\r\nhis montaria and his hammock, his little plantation of bananas and\r\nmandioca, and the dwelling, for which the forest about him supplies\r\nthe material, the Amazonian Indian is supplied with all the\r\nnecessities of life.\r\n\r\nSometimes the party were settled, for weeks at a time, in more\r\ncivilized fashion, in the towns or villages on the banks of the\r\nmain river, or its immediate neighborhood, at Manaos, Ega, Obydos,\r\nand elsewhere. Wherever they sojourned, whether for a longer or a\r\nshorter time, the scientific work went on uninterruptedly. There\r\nwas not an idle member in the company.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he left Rio de Janeiro, Agassiz had the companionship\r\nof a young Brazilian officer of the engineer corps, Major Coutinho.\r\nThoroughly familiar with the Amazons and its affluents, at home\r\nwith the Indians, among whom he had often lived, he was the pearl\r\nof traveling companions as well as a valuable addition to the\r\nscientific force. Agassiz left the Amazonian valley in April, and\r\nthe two remaining months of his stay in Brazil were devoted to\r\nexcursions along the coast, especially in the mountains back of\r\nCeara, and in the Organ mountains near Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end this journey fulfilled Agassiz's brightest\r\nanticipations. Mr. Thayer, whose generosity first placed the\r\nexpedition on so broad a scientific basis, continued to give it his\r\ncordial support till the last specimen was stored in the Museum.\r\nThe interest taken in it by the Emperor of Brazil, and the\r\nliberality of the government toward it, also facilitated all\r\nAgassiz's aims and smoothed every difficulty in the path. On\r\nstarting he had set before himself two subjects of inquiry. These\r\nwere, first, the fresh-water fauna of Brazil, of the greater\r\ninterest to him, because of the work on the Brazilian Fishes, with\r\nwhich his scientific career had opened; and second, her glacial\r\nhistory, for he believed that even these latitudes must have been,\r\nto a greater or less degree, included in the ice-period. The first\r\nthree months spent in Rio de Janeiro and its environs gave him the\r\nkey to phenomena connected with both these subjects, and he\r\nfollowed them from there to the head-waters of the Amazons, as an\r\nIndian follows a trail. The distribution of life in the rivers and\r\nlakes of Brazil, the immense number of species and their local\r\ncircumscription, as distinct faunae in definite areas of the same\r\nwater-basin, amazed him; while the character of the soil and other\r\ngeological features confirmed him in his preconceived belief that\r\nthe glacial period could not have been less than cosmic in its\r\ninfluence. He was satisfied that the tropical, as well as the\r\ntemperate and arctic regions, had been, although in a less degree,\r\nfashioned by ice.\r\n\r\nJust before leaving the United States he received a letter of\r\nfriendly farewell from Charles Sumner, and his answer, written on\r\nthe Rio Negro, gives some idea of the conditions under which he\r\ntraveled, and of the results he had obtained. As the letters\r\nexplain each other, both are given here.\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful expedition that you are about to commence,--in\r\ncontrast with the deeds of war. And yet you are going forth to\r\nconquer new realms, and bring them under a sway they have not yet\r\nknown. But science is peaceful and bloodless in her conquests. May\r\nyou return victorious! I am sure you will. Of course you will see\r\nthe Emperor of Brazil, whose enlightened character is one of the\r\nhappy accidents of government. . .You are a naturalist; but you are\r\na patriot also. If you can take advantage of the opportunities\r\nwhich you will surely enjoy, and plead for our country, to the end\r\nthat its rights may be understood, and the hardships it has been\r\nobliged to endure may be appreciated, you will render a service to\r\nthe cause of international peace and good-will.\r\n\r\nYou are to have great enjoyment. I imagine you already very happy\r\nin the scenes before you. I, too, should like to see Nature in her\r\nmost splendid robes; but I must stay at home and help keep the\r\npeace. Good-by--Bon voyage!\r\n\r\nEver sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES SUMNER.\r\n\r\nRIO NEGRO; ON BOARD THE BRAZILIAN WAR STEAMER IBICUHY, December 26,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SUMNER,\r\n\r\nThe heading of these lines tells a long and interesting story. Here\r\nI am, sailing on the Rio Negro, with my wife and a young Brazilian\r\nfriend, provided with all the facilities which modern improvements,\r\nthe extraordinary liberality of the Brazilian government, and the\r\nkindness of our commander can bestow, and pursuing my scientific\r\ninvestigations with as much ease as if I were in my study, or in\r\nthe Museum at Cambridge,--with this enormous difference, that I am\r\nwriting on deck, protected by an awning from the hot sun, and\r\nsurrounded by all the luxuriance of the richest tropical\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThe kind reception I met at the hands of the emperor on my arrival\r\nat Rio has been followed by every possible attention and mark of\r\ngood-will toward me personally, but usually tendered in such a way\r\nas to show that an expression of cordiality toward the United\r\nStates was intended also in the friendly feeling with which\r\neverything was done to facilitate my researches. In the first\r\nplace, the emperor gave me as a traveling companion an extremely\r\nintelligent and well-educated Brazilian, the man of all others whom\r\nI should have chosen had I been consulted beforehand; and for the\r\nsix months during which we have been on our journey here, I have\r\nnot been able to spend a dollar except for my personal comfort, and\r\nfor my collections. All charges for transportation of persons and\r\nbaggage in public conveyances, as well as for specimens, have\r\neverywhere been remitted by order of the government. This is not\r\nall; when we reached Para the Brazilian Steamship Company placed a\r\nsteamer at my disposal, that I might stop where I pleased on the\r\nway, and tarry as long as I liked instead of following the ordinary\r\nline of travel. In this way I ascended the Amazons to Manaos, and\r\nfrom there, by the ordinary steamer, reached the borders of Peru,\r\nmaking prolonged stays at Manaos and at Ega, and sending out\r\nexploring parties up the Javary, the Jutay, the Ica, etc. On my\r\nreturn to Manaos, at the junction of the Rio Negro and the Amazons,\r\nI found the Ibicuhy awaiting me with an order from the Minister of\r\nPublic Works, placing her at my disposal for the remainder of my\r\nstay in the waters of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe Ibicuhy is a pretty little war steamer of 120 horse power,\r\ncarrying six thirty-two pound guns. On board of her, and in company\r\nwith the President of the Province, I have already visited that\r\nextraordinary network of river anastomoses and lakes, stretching\r\nbetween the river Madeira and the Amazons to the river Tapajos, and\r\nnow I am ascending the Rio Negro, with the intention of going up as\r\nfar as the junction of the Rio Branco with the Rio Negro. That the\r\nBrazilian government should be able and willing to offer such\r\nfacilities for the benefit of science, during a time of war, when\r\nall the resources of the nation are called upon in order to put an\r\nend to the barbarism of Paraguay, is a most significant sign of the\r\ntendencies prevailing in the administration. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the emperor is the soul of the whole. This liberality has\r\nenabled me to devote all my resources to the making of collections,\r\nand the result of my researches has, of course, been proportionate\r\nto the facilities I have enjoyed. Thus far, the whole number of\r\nfishes known from the Amazons has amounted to a little over one\r\nhundred, counting everything that may exist from these waters, in\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes, the British Museum, the museums of Munich,\r\nBerlin, Vienna, etc.; while I have collected and now hold, in good\r\nstate of preservation, fourteen hundred and forty-two species, and\r\nmay get a few hundred more before returning to Para. I have so many\r\nduplicates that I may make every other museum tributary to ours, so\r\nfar as the fresh-water animals of Brazil are concerned. This may\r\nseem very unimportant to a statesman. But I am satisfied that it\r\naffords a standard by which to estimate the resources of Brazil, as\r\nthey may be hereafter developed. The basin of the Amazons is\r\nanother Mississippi, having a tropical climate, tempered by\r\nmoisture. Here is room for a hundred million happy human beings.\r\n\r\nEver truly your friend,\r\n\r\nL. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nThe repose of the return voyage, after sixteen months of such\r\nuninterrupted work, and of fresh impressions daily crowding upon\r\neach other, was most grateful to Agassiz. The summary of this\r\ndelightful journey may close as it began with a letter to his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nAT SEA, July 7, 1866.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER,\r\n\r\nWhen you receive this letter we shall be, I hope, at Nahant, where\r\nour children and grandchildren are waiting for us. To-morrow we\r\nshall stop at Pernambuco, where I shall mail my letter to you by a\r\nFrench steamer.\r\n\r\nI leave Brazil with great regret. I have passed nearly sixteen\r\nmonths in the uninterrupted enjoyment of this incomparable tropical\r\nnature, and I have learned many things which have enlarged my range\r\nof thought, both concerning organized beings and concerning the\r\nstructure of the earth. I have found traces of glaciers under this\r\nburning sky; a proof that our earth has undergone changes of\r\ntemperature more considerable than even our most advanced\r\nglacialists have dared to suggest. Imagine, if you can, floating\r\nice under the equator, such as now exists on the coasts of\r\nGreenland, and you will probably have an approximate idea of the\r\naspect of the Atlantic Ocean at that epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the basin of the Amazons especially, that my\r\nresearches have been crowned with an unexpected success. Spix and\r\nMartius, for whose journey I wrote, as you doubtless remember, my\r\nfirst work on fishes, brought back from there some fifty species,\r\nand the sum total known now, taking the results of all the\r\ntravelers who have followed up the inquiry, does not amount to two\r\nhundred. I had hoped, in making fishes the special object of my\r\nresearches, to add perhaps a hundred more. You will understand my\r\nsurprise when I rapidly obtained five or six hundred, and finally,\r\non leaving Para, brought away nearly two thousand,--that is to say,\r\nten times more than were known when I began my journey.* (* This\r\nestimate was made in the field when close comparison of specimens\r\nfrom distant localities was out of the question. The whole\r\ncollection has never been worked up, and it is possible that the\r\nnumber of new species it contains, though undoubtedly greatly in\r\nexcess of those previously known from the Amazons, may prove to be\r\nless than was at first supposed.--ED.) A great part of this success\r\nis due to the unusual facilities granted me by the Brazilian\r\ngovernment. . .To the Emperor of Brazil I owe the warmest\r\ngratitude. His kindness to me has been beyond all bounds. . .He\r\neven made for me, while he was with the army last summer, a\r\ncollection of fishes from the province of Rio Grande du Sud. This\r\ncollection would do honor to a professional naturalist. . .\r\n\r\nGood-by, dear mother.\r\n\r\nWith all my heart,\r\n\r\nYOUR LOUIS.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from old Professor Martius in Munich, of\r\nuncertain date, but probably in answer to one of March, 1866, is\r\ninteresting, as connecting this journey with his own Brazilian\r\nexpedition almost half a century before.\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR MARTIUS.\r\n\r\nFebruary 26, 1867.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nYour letter of March 20th last year was most gratifying to me as a\r\ntoken of your affectionate remembrance. You will easily believe\r\nthat I followed your journey on the Amazons with the greatest\r\ninterest, and without any alloy of envy, though your expedition was\r\nundertaken forty years later than mine, and under circumstances so\r\nmuch more favorable. Bates, who lived for years in that country,\r\nhas borne me witness that I was not wanting in courage and industry\r\nduring an exploration which lasted eleven months; and I therefore\r\nbelieve that you also, in reviewing on the spot my description of\r\nthe journey, will not have passed an unfavorable judgment. Our\r\ngreatest difficulty was the small size of our boat which was so\r\nweak as to make the crossing of the river always dangerous. I shall\r\nlook forward with great pleasure to the more detailed account of\r\nyour journey, and also the plan of your route, which I hope you\r\nwill send me. Can you tell me anything about the human skeletons at\r\nthe Rio St. Antonio in St. Paul? I am very glad to know that you\r\nhave paid especial attention to the palms, and I entreat you to\r\nsend me the essential parts of every species which you hold to be\r\nnew, because I wish to work out the palms for the Flora\r\nBrasiliensis this year. I wish I might find among them some new\r\ngenus or species, which then should bear your name.\r\n\r\nDo you intend to publish an account of your journey, or shall you\r\nconfine yourself entirely to a report on your observations on\r\nNatural History? With a desire to explain the numerous names of\r\nanimals, plants, and places, which are derived from the Tupee\r\nlanguage, I have studied it for years that I might be able to use\r\nit fluently. Perhaps you have seen my \"Glossaria lignareus\r\nbrasiliensium.\" It contains also 1150 names of animals. To this\r\nwork belong, likewise, my ethnographical contributions, of which\r\nforty-five sheets are already printed, to be published I hope next\r\nyear. I am curious to hear your geological conclusions. I am myself\r\ninclined to the belief that men existed in South America previous\r\nto the latest geological catastrophes. As you have seen so many\r\nNorth American Indians, you will be able to give interesting\r\nexplanations of their somatic relations to the South American\r\nIndians. Why could you not send me, as secretary of the\r\nmathematical and physical section, a short report of your principal\r\nresults? It would then be printed in the report of our meetings,\r\nwhich, as the forerunner of other publications, could hardly fail\r\nto be agreeable to you. You no doubt see our friend Asa Gray\r\noccasionally. Remember me cordially to him, and tell him I look\r\neagerly for an answer to my last letter. The year 'sixty-six has\r\ntaken from us many eminent botanists, Gusone, Mettenius, Von\r\nSchlechtendal, and Fresenius. I hear but rarely from our excellent\r\nfriend Alexander Braun. He does not resist the approach of old age\r\nso well as you, my dear friend. You are still the active\r\nnaturalist, fresh and well preserved, to judge by your photograph.\r\nThank you for it; I send mine in return. My wife still holds in\r\nwarm remembrance the days when you, a bright, pleasant young\r\nfellow, used to come and see us,--what a long stretch of time lies\r\nbetween. Much is changed about me. Of former friends only Kobell\r\nand Vogel remain; Zuccarini, Wagner, Oken, Schelling, Sieber,\r\nFuchs, Walther,--all these have gone home. All the pleasanter is it\r\nthat you, on the other side of the ocean, think sometimes of your\r\nold friend, to whom a letter from you will be always welcome.\r\nRemember me to your family, though I am not known to them. May the\r\npresent year bring you health, cheerfulness, and the full enjoyment\r\nof your great and glorious success.\r\n\r\nWith warm esteem and friendship, always yours,\r\n\r\nMARTIUS.\r\n\r\nAgassiz arrived in Cambridge toward the end of August, 1866. After\r\nthe first excitement of meeting family and friends was over, he\r\ntook up his college and museum work again. He had left for Brazil\r\nat the close of a course before the Lowell Institute, and his first\r\npublic appearance after his return was on the same platform. The\r\nrush for tickets was far in excess of the supply, and he was\r\nwelcomed with the most ardent enthusiasm. It continued unabated to\r\nthe close, although the lectures borrowed no interest from personal\r\nadventure or incidents of travel, but dealt almost wholly with the\r\nintellectual results and larger scientific generalizations growing\r\nout of the expedition. Later in the winter he gave a course also at\r\nthe Cooper Institute, in New York, which awakened the same interest\r\nand drew crowds of listeners. The resolution offered by Bancroft,\r\nthe historian, at the close of the course, gives an idea of its\r\ncharacter, and coming from such a source, may not unfitly be\r\ntranscribed here.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That the thanks of this great assembly of delighted\r\nhearers be given to the illustrious Professor Agassiz, for the\r\nfullness of his instruction, for the clearness of his method of\r\nillustration, for his exposition of the idea as antecedent to form;\r\nof the superiority of the undying, original, and eternal force over\r\nits transient manifestations; for happy hours which passed too\r\nrapidly away; for genial influences of which the memory will last\r\nthrough our lives.\r\n\r\nAll his leisure hours during the winter of 1867 were given to the\r\nreview and arrangement of the great collections he had brought\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nTO SIR PHILIP DE GREY EGERTON.\r\n\r\nMUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS., March 26,\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nI know you will be pleased to hear that I have returned to the\r\nstudy of fishes, and that I am not likely to give it up again for\r\nyears to come. My success in collecting in the Amazons has been so\r\nunexpected that it will take me years to give an account of what I\r\nhave found, and I am bound to show that the strange statements that\r\nhave gone abroad are strictly correct. Yes, I have about eighteen\r\nhundred new species of fishes from the basin of the Amazons! The\r\ncollection is now in Cambridge, for the most part in good\r\npreservation. It suggests at once the idea that either the other\r\nrivers of the world have been very indifferently explored, or that\r\ntropical America nourishes a variety of animals unknown to other\r\nregions. In this dilemma it would be worth while to send some\r\nnaturalist to investigate the Ganges or the Bramaputra, or some of\r\nthe great Chinese rivers. Can it not be done by order of the\r\nBritish government?\r\n\r\nPlease send me whatever you may publish upon the fossil fishes in\r\nyour possession. I frequently sigh for another session in your\r\nmuseum, and it is not improbable that I shall solicit an invitation\r\nfrom you in a few years, in order to revise my views of the whole\r\nsubject in connection with what I am now learning of the living\r\nfishes. By the way, I have eleven hundred colored drawings of the\r\nspecies of Brazil made from life by my old friend Burkhardt, who\r\naccompanied me on this journey.\r\n\r\nMy recent studies have made me more adverse than ever to the new\r\nscientific doctrines which are flourishing now in England. This\r\nsensational zeal reminds me of what I experienced as a young man in\r\nGermany, when the physio-philosophy of Oken had invaded every\r\ncentre of scientific activity; and yet, what is there left of it? I\r\ntrust to outlive this mania also. As usual, I do not ask beforehand\r\nwhat you think of it, and I may have put my hand into a hornet's\r\nnest; but you know your old friend Agass, and will forgive him if\r\nhe hits a tender spot. . .\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1867 was passed very tranquilly at his Nahant\r\nlaboratory, in that quiet work with his specimens and his\r\nmicroscope which pleased him best. The following letter to\r\nProfessor Benjamin Peirce, who was then Superintendent of the Coast\r\nSurvey, shows, however, his unfailing interest in the bearing of\r\nscientific researches on questions of public utility.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR PEIRCE, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE COAST SURVEY.\r\n\r\nNAHANT, September 11, 1867.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nFar from considering your request a tax upon my time, it gives me\r\nthe greatest pleasure to have an opportunity of laying before you\r\nsome statements and reflections, which I trust may satisfy you that\r\ngeology and natural history can be made subservient to the great\r\ninterests of a civilized community, to a far greater extent than is\r\ngenerally admitted.\r\n\r\nThe question of the harbor of Boston, for instance, has a\r\ngeological and zoological side, thus far only indirectly\r\nconsidered. In order to ascertain whence the materials are derived\r\nwhich accumulate in the harbor, the shores ought to be studied\r\ngeologically with a kind of accuracy and minuteness, never required\r\nby geological surveys made for economical purposes. The banks of\r\nthe harbor, wherever it is not rock-bound, consist of drift, which\r\nitself rests upon the various rock formations of the district. Now\r\nthis drift, as I have ascertained, formerly extended many miles\r\nbeyond our present shores, and is still slowly washed away by the\r\naction of tides, winds, and currents. Until you know with precision\r\nthe mineralogical composition of the drift of the immediate\r\nvicinity, so accurately indeed as to be able to recognize it in any\r\nnew combination into which it may be brought when carried off by\r\nthe sea, all your examination of soundings may be of little use.\r\nShould it, however, be ascertained that the larger amount of loose\r\nmaterial spreading over the harbor is derived from some one or\r\nother of the drift islands in the bay, the building of sea-walls to\r\nstop the denudation may be of greater and more immediate use than\r\nany other operation. Again, it is geologically certain that all the\r\ndrift islands of the harbor have been formed by the encroachment of\r\nthe sea upon a sheet of drift, which once extended in unbroken\r\ncontinuity from Cape Ann to Cape Cod and farther south. This sheet\r\nof drift is constantly diminishing, and in centuries to come,\r\nwhich, notwithstanding the immeasurable duration of geological\r\nperiods, may be reached, I trust, while the United States still\r\nremains a flourishing empire, it will be removed still further; so\r\nfar indeed, that I foresee the time when the whole peninsula of\r\nCape Cod shall disappear. Under these circumstances, it is the duty\r\nof a wise administration to establish with precision the rate and\r\nthe extent of this destruction, that the coming generations may be\r\nforewarned. In connection with this I would advise the making of a\r\nthorough survey of the harbor, to ascertain the extent of rock\r\nsurface and of drift, and the relative position of the two, with\r\nmaps to show their relations to the different levels of the sea,\r\nwhereby the unequal action of the tides upon the various beaches\r\nmay be estimated.\r\n\r\nThe zoological side of the question relates to the amount of loose\r\nmaterials accumulating in consequence of the increase of animal and\r\nvegetable life, especially of those microscopic beings which,\r\nnotwithstanding their extraordinary minuteness, form in course of\r\ntime vast deposits of solid materials. Ehrenberg has shown that the\r\nharbor of Wismar, on the Prussian coast of the Baltic, is filling,\r\nnot in consequence of the accumulation of inorganic sediments, but\r\nby the rapid increase and decay of innumerable animalcules. To what\r\nextent such deposits may accumulate has also been shown by\r\nEhrenberg, who ascertained, many years ago, that the city of Berlin\r\nrests upon a deposit of about eighteen feet in thickness,\r\nconsisting almost exclusively of the solid parts of such\r\nmicroscopic beings. These two cases may suffice to show how\r\nimportant may be a zoological investigation of the harbor deposits.\r\n\r\nI need hardly add that the deposits floated into the harbor, by the\r\nnumerous rivers and creeks which empty into it, ought to be\r\ninvestigated with the same care and minuteness as the drift\r\nmaterials. This investigation should also include the drainage of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nBut this is only a small part of the application I would recommend\r\nto be made of geological and zoological knowledge, to the purposes\r\nof the Coast Survey. The reefs of Florida are of the deepest\r\ninterest, and the mere geodetic and hydrographic surveys of their\r\nwhole range would be far from exhausting the subject. It is my\r\ndeliberate opinion that the great reefs of Florida should be\r\nexplored with as much minuteness and fullness as the Gulf Stream,\r\nand that the investigation will require as much labor as has thus\r\nfar been bestowed on the Gulf Stream. Here again geological and\r\nzoological knowledge is indispensable to the completion of the\r\nwork. The reef is formed mainly by the accumulation of solid\r\nmaterials from a variety of animals and a few plants. The relations\r\nof these animals and plants to one another while alive, in and upon\r\nthe reef, ought to be studied more fully than has been the case\r\nheretofore, in order to determine with certainty the share they\r\nhave in the formation of these immense submarine walls so dangerous\r\nto navigation. The surveys, as they have been made thus far,\r\nfurnish only the necessary information concerning the present form\r\nand extent of the reef. But we know that it is constantly changing,\r\nincreasing, enlarging, spreading, rising in such a way and at such\r\na rate, that the surveys of one century become insufficient for the\r\nnext. A knowledge of these changes can only be obtained by a\r\nnaturalist, familiar with the structure and mode of growth of the\r\nanimals. The survey I made about fifteen years ago, at the request\r\nof your lamented predecessor, could only be considered as a\r\nreconnaissance, in view of the extent and importance of the work. I\r\nwould, therefore, recommend you to organize a party specially\r\ndetailed to carry on these investigations in connection with, and\r\nby the side of, the regular geodetic and hydrographic survey. Here,\r\nalso, would geological knowledge be of great advantage to the\r\nexplorer. In confirmation of my recommendation I need only remind\r\nyou of a striking fact in the history of our science. More than\r\nthirty years ago, before Dana and Darwin had published their\r\nbeautiful investigations upon the coral reefs, a pupil of mine, the\r\nlate Armand Gressly, had traced the structure and mode of growth of\r\ncoral reefs and atolls in the Jura mountains, thus anticipating, by\r\na geological investigation, results afterward obtained by dredging\r\nin the ocean. The structure of the reefs of our shores is,\r\ntherefore, more likely to be fully understood by one who is\r\nentirely familiar with zoology and geology than by a surveyor who\r\nhas no familiarity with either of these sciences.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why I would urge upon you the application\r\nof natural sciences to the work of the survey. The depth of the\r\nocean is a great obstacle to a satisfactory exploration of its\r\nbottom. But we know now that nearly all dry land has been sea\r\nbottom before it was raised above the level of the water. This is\r\nat least the case with all the stratified rocks and aqueous\r\ndeposits forming part of the earth's crust. Now it would greatly\r\nfacilitate the study of the bottom of the sea if, after\r\nascertaining by soundings the general character of the bottom in\r\nany particular region, corresponding bottoms on dry land were\r\nexamined, so that by a comparison of the one with the other, both\r\nmight be better understood. The shoals of the southern coast of\r\nMassachusetts have been surveyed, and their position is now known\r\nwith great accuracy; but their internal structure, their mode of\r\nformation, is only imperfectly ascertained, owing to the difficulty\r\nof cutting into them and examining in situ the materials of which\r\nthey are composed. Nothing, on the contrary, is easier than to\r\nexplore the structure or composition of drift hills which are cut\r\nthrough by all our railroad tracks. Now the shoals and rips of\r\nNantucket have their counterparts on the main-land; and even along\r\nthe shores of Boston Harbor, in the direction of Dorchester and\r\nMilton, such shoals may be examined, far away from the waters to\r\nwhich they owe their deposits. Here, then, is the place to complete\r\nthe exploration, for which soundings and dredgings give only\r\nimperfect information.\r\n\r\nI need not extend these remarks further in order to satisfy you of\r\nthe importance of geological and zoological researches in\r\nconnection with the regular operations of the Coast Survey. Permit\r\nme, however, to add a few words upon some points which, as it seems\r\nto me, belong legitimately to the Coast Survey, and to which\r\nsufficient attention has not yet been paid. I allude, first, to the\r\nsalt marshes of our shores, their formation and uses, as well as\r\ntheir gradual disappearance under the advance of the sea; second,\r\nto the extended low islands in the form of reefs along the coast of\r\nthe Southern States, the bases of which may be old coral reefs;\r\nthird, the form of all our estuaries, which has resulted from the\r\nconflict of the sea with the drift formation, and is therefore, in\r\na measure, a geological problem; fourth, the extensive deposits of\r\nforaminifera along the coast, which ought to be compared with the\r\ndeposits of tripoli found in many tertiary formations; fifth, the\r\ngeneral form and outline of our continent, with all its\r\nindentations, which are due to their geological structure. Indeed,\r\nthe shore everywhere is the result of the conflict of the ocean\r\nwith the rock formation of the land, and therefore as much a\r\nquestion for geology as geodesy to answer.\r\n\r\nShould the preceding remarks induce you to carry my suggestions\r\ninto practical operation, be assured that it will at all times give\r\nme the greatest pleasure to contribute to the success of your\r\nadministration, not only by advice, but by actual participation in\r\nyour work whenever that is wanted. The scientific men of America\r\nlook to you for the publication of the great results already\r\nsecured by the Coast Survey, well knowing that this national\r\nenterprise can only be benefited by the high-minded course which\r\nhas at all times marked your intellectual career.\r\n\r\nEver truly your friend,\r\n\r\nL. AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nThis year closed for Agassiz with a heavy sorrow. His mother's\r\nhealth had been failing of late, and November brought the news of\r\nher death. Separated though they were, there had never been any\r\nbreak in their intercourse. As far as he could, he kept her advised\r\nof all his projects and undertakings, and his work was no less\r\ninteresting to her when the ocean lay between them than when he\r\ncould daily share it with her. She had an unbounded sympathy with\r\nhim in the new ties he had formed in this country, and seemed\r\nindeed as intimately allied with his later life here as with its\r\nearlier European portion.\r\n\r\nHis own health, which had seemed for a time to have regained the\r\nvigor of youth, broke down again in the following spring, and an\r\nattack about the region of the heart disabled him for a number of\r\nweeks. To this date belongs a short correspondence between Agassiz\r\nand Oswald Heer. Heer's work on the Fossil Flora of the Arctics had\r\nrecently appeared, and a presentation copy from him reached Agassiz\r\nas he was slowly regaining strength after his illness, although\r\nstill confined to the house. It could not have come at a happier\r\nmoment, for it engrossed him completely, and turned his thoughts\r\naway from the occupations which he was not yet allowed to resume.\r\nThe book had a twofold interest for him: although in another branch\r\nof science, it was akin to his own earlier investigations, inasmuch\r\nas it reconstructed the once rich flora of the polar regions as he\r\nhimself had reconstructed the fauna of past geological times; it\r\nclothed their frozen fields with forests as he had sheeted now\r\nfertile lands with ice. In short, it appealed powerfully to the\r\nimagination, and no child in the tedious hours of convalescence was\r\never more beguiled by a story-book than he by the pictures which\r\nthis erudite work called up.\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ TO OSWALD HEER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 12, 1868.\r\n\r\nMY HONORED COLLEAGUE,\r\n\r\nYour beautiful book on the Fossil Arctic Flora reached me, just as\r\nI was recovering from a tedious and painful illness. I could,\r\ntherefore, take it in hand at once, and have been delighted with\r\nit. You give a captivating picture of the successive changes which\r\nthe Arctic regions have undergone. No work could be more valuable,\r\neither as a means of opening recent investigations in Paleontology\r\nto the larger public, or of advancing science itself. If I can find\r\nthe time I mean to prepare an abridgment in popular form for one of\r\nour reviews. Meantime I have written to Professor Henry,\r\nSuperintendent of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, that\r\nhe should subscribe for a number of copies to be distributed among\r\nless wealthy establishments. I hope he will do this, and I shall\r\ncontinue to urge it, since my friendly relations with him give me a\r\nright so to do. I have, moreover, written to the directors of\r\nvarious prominent institutions, in order that your work, so far as\r\nis possible for works of that kind, may become known in the United\r\nStates, and reach such persons as would naturally be interested in\r\nit. . .\r\n\r\nWith friendly remembrance, yours always,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nThe answer is some months later in date, but is given here for its\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nFROM OSWALD HEER.\r\n\r\nZURICH, December 8, 1868.\r\n\r\nMY HONORED FRIEND,\r\n\r\nYour letter of last May gave me the greatest pleasure, and I should\r\nhave answered it earlier had I not heard that you had gone to the\r\nRocky Mountains, and supposed, therefore, that my letter would\r\nhardly find you at home again before the late autumn. I will delay\r\nwriting no longer,--the more so because I have received, through\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, your great work on the Natural History\r\nof the United States. Valuable as it is in itself, it has a double\r\nattraction for me as the gift of the author. Accept my warm thanks.\r\nIt will always be to me a token of your friendly regard. It gave me\r\ngreat satisfaction to know that my Fossil Arctic Flora had met with\r\nyour approval. Since then many new facts have come to light tending\r\nto confirm my results. The Whymper Expedition brought to England a\r\nnumber of fossil plants, which have been sent to me for\r\nexamination. I found eighty species, of which thirty-two from North\r\nGreenland are new, so that we now know 137 species of Miocene\r\nplants from North Greenland (70 degrees north latitude). It was a\r\nreal delight to me to find the fruit cup of the Castanea [chestnut]\r\ninclosing three seeds (three Kastanica) and covered with prickles\r\nlike the Castanea vesca; and, furthermore, I was able to prove by\r\nthe flowers, which were preserved with the fruit, that the\r\nsupposition given in the Arctic Flora (page 106) was correct;\r\nnamely, that the leaves of the Fagus castaneafolia Ung. truly\r\nbelong to a Castanea. As several fruits are contained in one fruit\r\ncup, this Miocene Castanea must have been nearer to the European\r\nspecies (C. vesca) than to the American Castanea (the C. pumila\r\nMicha). The leaves have been drawn in the Flora Arctica, and are\r\nalso preserved in the Whymper collection.\r\n\r\nI have received very beautiful and large leaves of the Castanea\r\nwhich I have called C. Ungeri, from Alaska. I am now occupied in\r\nworking up this fossil Alaskan flora; the plants are in great part\r\ndrawn, and contain magnificent leaves. The treatise will be\r\npublished by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm; I hope to send you a\r\ncopy a few months hence. This flora is remarkable for its\r\nresemblance to the European Miocene flora. The liquidambar, as well\r\nas several poplars and willows, cannot be distinguished from those\r\nof Oeningen; the same is true of an Elm, a Carpinus, and others. As\r\nAlaska now belongs to the United States, it is to be hoped that\r\nthese collecting stations, which have already furnished such\r\nmagnificent plants, will be farther ransacked. . .Hoping that you\r\nhave returned safely from your journey, and that these lines may\r\nfind you well, I remain, with cordial greeting,\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nOSWALD HEER.\r\n\r\nShortly after Agassiz's recovery, in July, 1868, he was invited by\r\nMr. Samuel Hooper to join a party of friends, tired members of\r\nCongress and business men, on an excursion to the West, under\r\nconditions which promised not only rest and change, but an\r\nopportunity for studying glacial phenomena over a broad region of\r\nprairie and mountain which Agassiz had never visited. They were to\r\nmeet at Chicago, keep on from there to St. Paul, and down the\r\nMississippi, turning off through Kansas to the eastern branch of\r\nthe Pacific Railroad, at the terminus of which they were to meet\r\nGeneral Sherman with ambulances and an escort for conveyance across\r\nthe country to the Union Pacific Railroad, returning then by\r\nDenver, Utah, and Omaha, and across the State of Iowa to the\r\nMississippi once more. This journey was of great interest to\r\nAgassiz, and its scientific value was heightened by a subsequent\r\nstay of nearly two months at Ithaca, N.Y., on his return. Cornell\r\nUniversity was then just opened at Ithaca, and he had accepted an\r\nappointment as non-resident professor, with the responsibility of\r\ndelivering annually a course of lectures on various subjects of\r\nnatural history. New efforts in behalf of education always\r\nattracted him, and this drew him with an even stronger magnet than\r\nusual, involving as it did an untried experiment--the attempt,\r\nnamely, to combine the artisan with the student, manual labor with\r\nintellectual work. The plan was a generous one, and stimulated both\r\npupils and teachers. Among the latter none had greater sympathy\r\nwith the high ideal and broad humanity of the undertaking than\r\nAgassiz.* (* Very recently a memorial tablet has been placed in the\r\nChapel at Cornell University by the trustees, recording their\r\ngratitude for the share he took in the initiation of the\r\ninstitution.)\r\n\r\nBeside the enthusiasm which he brought to his special work, he\r\nfound an added pleasure at Cornell in the fact that the region in\r\nwhich the new university was situated contained another chapter in\r\nthe book of glacial records he had so long been reading, and made\r\nalso, as the following letter tells us, a natural sequence to his\r\nrecent observations in the West.\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA RIVE.\r\n\r\nITHACA, October 26, 1868.\r\n\r\n. . .I am passing some weeks here, and am studying the erratic\r\nphenomena, and especially the formation of the many small lakes\r\nwhich literally swarm in this region, and are connected in various\r\nways with the glacial epoch. The journey which I have just\r\ncompleted has furnished me with a multitude of new facts concerning\r\nthe glacial period, the long continuance of which, and its\r\nimportance with reference to the physical history of the globe,\r\nbecome daily more clear to me. The origin and mode of formation of\r\nthe vast system of our American rivers have especially occupied me,\r\nand I think I have found the solution of the problem which they\r\npresent. This system reproduces the lines followed by the water\r\nover the surface of the ground moraines, which covered the whole\r\ncontinent, when the great sheet of ice which modeled the drift\r\nbroke up and melted away. This conclusion will, no doubt, be as\r\nslow of acceptance as was the theory of the ancient extension of\r\nglaciers. But that does not trouble me. For my own part I am\r\nconfident of its truth, and after having seen the idea of a glacial\r\nepoch finally adopted by all except those who are interested in\r\nopposing it on account of certain old and artificial theories, I\r\ncan wait a little till the changes which succeeded that epoch are\r\nalso understood. I have obtained direct proof that the prairies of\r\nthe West rest upon polished rock. It has happened in the course of\r\nrecent building on the prairie, that the native rock has been laid\r\nbare here and there, and this rock is as distinctly furrowed by the\r\naction of the glacier and by its engraving process, as the Handeck,\r\nor the slopes of the Jura. I have seen magnificent slabs in\r\nNebraska in the basin of the river Platte. Do not the physicists\r\nbegin to think of explaining to us the probable cause of changes so\r\nremarkable and so well established? We can no longer evade the\r\nquestion by supposing these phenomena to be due to the action of\r\ngreat currents. We have to do first with sheets of ice, five or six\r\nthousand feet in thickness (an estimate which can be tested by\r\nindirect measurements in the Northern States), covering the whole\r\ncontinent, and then with the great currents which ensued upon the\r\nbreaking up of that mass of ice. He who does not distinguish\r\nbetween these two series of facts, and perceive their connection,\r\ndoes not understand the geology of the Quaternary epoch. . .\r\n\r\nOf about this date is the following pleasant letter from Longfellow\r\nto Agassiz. Although it has no special bearing upon what precedes,\r\nit is inserted here, because their near neighborhood and constant\r\npersonal intercourse, both at Cambridge and Nahant, made letters\r\nrare between them. Friends who see each other so often are\r\ninfrequent correspondents.\r\n\r\nROME, December 31, 1868.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AGASSIZ,\r\n\r\nI fully intended to write you from Switzerland, that my letter\r\nmight come to you like a waft of cool air from a glacier in the\r\nheat of summer. But alas! I did not find cool air enough for\r\nmyself, much less to send across the sea. Switzerland was as hot as\r\nCambridge, and all life was taken out of me; and the letter\r\nremained in the inkstand. I draw it forth as follows.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I most wished to say, and which I say first, is\r\nthe delight with which I found your memory so beloved in England.\r\nAt Cambridge, Professor Sedgwick said, \"Give my love to Agassiz.\r\nGive him the blessing of an old man.\" In London, Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison said, \"I have known a great many men that I liked; but I\r\nLOVE Agassiz.\" In the Isle of Wight, Darwin said, \"What a set of\r\nmen you have in Cambridge! Both our universities put together\r\ncannot furnish the like. Why, there is Agassiz,--he counts for\r\nthree.\"\r\n\r\nOne of my pleasantest days in Switzerland was that passed at\r\nYverdon. In the morning I drove out to see the Gasparins. In their\r\nabundant hospitality they insisted upon my staying to dinner, and\r\nproposed a drive up the valley of the Orbe. I could not resist; so\r\nup the lovely valley we drove, and passed the old chateau of the\r\nReine Berthe, one of my favorite heroines, but, what was far more\r\nto me, passed the little town of Orbe. There it stands, with its\r\nold church tower and the trees on the terrace, just as when you\r\nplayed under them as a boy. It was very, very pleasant to behold\r\n. . .Thanks for your letter from the far West. I see by the papers\r\nthat you have been lecturing at the Cornell University.\r\n\r\nWith kindest greetings and remembrances, always affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nH.W.L.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22.\r\n\r\n1868-1871: AGE 61-64.\r\n\r\nNew Subscription to Museum.\r\nAdditional Buildings.\r\nArrangement of New Collections.\r\nDredging Expedition on Board the Bibb.\r\nAddress at the Humboldt Centennial.\r\nAttack on the Brain.\r\nSuspension of Work.\r\nWorking Force at the Museum.\r\nNew Accessions.\r\nLetter from Professor Sedgwick.\r\nLetter from Professor Deshayes.\r\nRestored Health.\r\nHassler Voyage proposed.\r\nAcceptance.\r\nScientific Preparation for the Voyage.\r\n\r\nAgassiz returned to Cambridge to find the Museum on an improved\r\nfooting financially. The Legislature had given seventy-five\r\nthousand dollars for an addition to the building, and private\r\nsubscriptions had doubled this sum, in order to provide for the\r\npreservation and arrangement of the new collections. In\r\nacknowledging this gift of the Legislature in his Museum Report for\r\n1868 Agassiz says:--\r\n\r\n\"While I rejoice in the prospect of this new building, as affording\r\nthe means for a complete exhibition of the specimens now stored in\r\nour cellars and attics and encumbering every room of the present\r\nedifice, I yet can hardly look forward to the time when we shall be\r\nin possession of it without shrinking from the grandeur of our\r\nundertaking. The past history of our science rises before me with\r\nits lessons. Thinking men in every part of the world have been\r\nstimulated to grapple with the infinite variety of problems,\r\nconnected with the countless animals scattered without apparent\r\norder throughout sea and land. They have been led to discover the\r\naffinities of various living beings. The past has yielded up its\r\nsecrets, and has shown them that the animals now peopling the earth\r\nare but the successors of countless populations which have preceded\r\nthem, and whose remains are buried in the crust of our globe.\r\nFurther study has revealed relations between the animals of past\r\ntime and those now living, and between the law of succession in the\r\nformer and the laws of growth and distribution in the latter, so\r\nintimate and comprehensive that this labyrinth of organic life\r\nassumes the character of a connected history, which opens before us\r\nwith greater clearness in proportion as our knowledge increases.\r\nBut when the museums of the Old World were founded, these relations\r\nwere not even suspected. The collections of natural history,\r\ngathered at immense expense in the great centres of human\r\ncivilization, were accumulated mainly as an evidence of man's\r\nknowledge and skill in exhibiting to the best advantage, not only\r\nthe animals, but the products and curiosities of all sorts from\r\nvarious parts of the world. While we admire and emulate the\r\nindustry and perseverance of the men who collected these materials,\r\nand did in the best way the work it was possible to do in their\r\ntime for science, we have no longer the right to build museums\r\nafter this fashion. The originality and vigor of one generation\r\nbecome the subservience and indolence of the next, if we only\r\nrepeat the work of our predecessors. They prepared the ground for\r\nus by accumulating the materials for extensive comparison and\r\nresearch. They presented the problem; we ought to be ready with the\r\nsolution. If I mistake not, the great object of our museums should\r\nbe to exhibit the whole animal kingdom as a manifestation of the\r\nSupreme Intellect. Scientific investigation in our day should be\r\ninspired by a purpose as animating to the general sympathy, as was\r\nthe religious zeal which built the Cathedral of Cologne or the\r\nBasilica of St. Peter's. The time is passed when men expressed\r\ntheir deepest convictions by these wonderful and beautiful\r\nreligious edifices; but it is my hope to see, with the progress of\r\nintellectual culture, a structure arise among us which may be a\r\ntemple of the revelations written in the material universe. If this\r\nbe so, our buildings for such an object can never be too\r\ncomprehensive, for they are to embrace the infinite work of\r\nInfinite Wisdom. They can never be too costly, so far as cost\r\nsecures permanence and solidity, for they are to contain the most\r\ninstructive documents of Omnipotence.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz gave the winter of 1869 to identifying, classifying, and\r\ndistributing the new collections. A few weeks in the spring were,\r\nhowever, passed with his friend Count de Pourtales in a dredging\r\nexpedition on board the Coast Survey Steamer Bibb, off the coast of\r\nCuba, on the Bahama Banks, and among the reefs of Florida. This\r\ndredging excursion, though it covered a wider ground than any\r\nprevious one, was the third deep-sea exploration undertaken by M.\r\nde Pourtales under the auspices of the Coast Survey. His\r\ninvestigations may truly be said to have exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence upon this line of research, and to have led the way to\r\nthe more extended work of the same kind carried on by the Coast\r\nSurvey in later years. He had long wished to show his old friend\r\nand teacher some of the rich dredging grounds he had discovered\r\nbetween Florida and the West Indies, and they thoroughly enjoyed\r\nthis short period of work together. Every day and hour brought some\r\nnew interest, and excess of material seemed the only difficulty.\r\n\r\nThis was Agassiz's last cruise in the Bibb, on whose hospitable\r\ndeck he had been a welcome guest from the first year of his arrival\r\nin this country. The results of this expedition, as connected with\r\nthe present conformation of the continent and its probable\r\ngeological history in the past, were given as follows in the Museum\r\nBulletin of the same year.\r\n\r\nREPORT UPON DEEP SEA DREDGINGS.*\r\n\r\n(* \"Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology\" 1 Number 13 1869\r\npages 368, 369.)\r\n\r\nBY LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen of the deep-sea bottom, I am already led to\r\ninfer that among the rocks forming the bulk of the stratified crust\r\nof our globe, from the oldest to the youngest formation, there are\r\nprobably none which have been formed in very deep waters. If this\r\nbe so, we shall have to admit that the areas now respectively\r\noccupied by our continents, as circumscribed by the two hundred\r\nfathom curve or thereabout, and the oceans at greater depth, have\r\nfrom the beginning retained their relative outline and position;\r\nthe continents having at all times been areas of gradual upheaval\r\nwith comparatively slight oscillations of rise and subsidence, and\r\nthe oceans at all times areas of gradual depression with equally\r\nslight oscillations. Now that the geological constitution of our\r\ncontinent is satisfactorily known over the greatest part of its\r\nextent, it seems to me to afford the strongest evidence that this\r\nhas been the case; while there is no support whatever for the\r\nassumption that any part of it has sunk again to any very great\r\ndepth after its rise above the surface of the ocean. The fact that\r\nupon the American continent, east of the Rocky Mountains, the\r\ngeological formations crop out in their regular succession, from\r\nthe oldest azoic and primordial deposits to the cretaceous\r\nformation, without the slightest indication of a great subsequent\r\nsubsidence, seems to me the most complete and direct demonstration\r\nof my proposition. Of the western part of the continent I am not\r\nprepared to speak with the same confidence. Moreover, the position\r\nof the cretaceous and tertiary formations along the low grounds\r\neast of the Allegheny range is another indication of the permanence\r\nof the ocean trough, on the margin of which these more recent beds\r\nhave been formed. I am well aware that in a comparatively recent\r\nperiod, portions of Canada and the United States, which now stand\r\nsix or seven hundred feet above the level of the sea, have been\r\nunder water; but this has not changed the configuration of the\r\ncontinent, if we admit that the latter is in reality circumscribed\r\nby the two hundred fathom curve of depth.\r\n\r\nThe summer was passed in his beloved laboratory at Nahant (as it\r\nproved, the last he ever spent there), where he was still\r\ncontinuing the preparation of his work on sharks and skates. At the\r\nclose of the summer, he interrupted this occupation for one to\r\nwhich he brought not only the reverence of a disciple, but a\r\nlife-long debt of personal gratitude and affection. He had been\r\nentreated to deliver the address at the Humboldt Centennial\r\nCelebration (September 15, 1869), organized under the auspices of\r\nthe Boston Society of Natural History. He had accepted the\r\ninvitation with many misgivings, for to literary work as such he\r\nwas unaccustomed, and in the field of the biographer he felt\r\nhimself a novice. His preparation for the task was conscientious\r\nand laborious. For weeks he shut himself up in a room of the Public\r\nLibrary in Boston and reviewed all the works of the great master,\r\nliving, as it were, in his presence. The result was a very concise\r\nand yet full memoir, a strong and vigorous sketch of Humboldt's\r\nresearches, and of their influence not only upon higher education\r\nat the present day, but on our most elementary instruction, until\r\nthe very \"school-boy is familiar with his methods, yet does not\r\nknow that Humboldt is his teacher.\" Agassiz's picture of this\r\ngenerous intellect, fertilizing whatever it touched, was made the\r\nmore life-like by the side lights which his affection for Humboldt\r\nand his personal intercourse with him in the past enabled him to\r\nthrow upon it. Emerson, who was present, said of this address,\r\n\"that Agassiz had never delivered a discourse more wise, more\r\nhappy, or of more varied power.\" George William Curtis writes of\r\nit: \"Your discourse seems to me the very ideal of such an address,\r\n--so broad, so simple, so comprehensive, so glowing, so profoundly\r\nappreciative, telling the story of Humboldt's life and work as I am\r\nsure no other living man can tell it.\" In memory of this occasion\r\nthe \"Humboldt Scholarship\" was founded at the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while to consider now whether this effort, added\r\nto the pressing work of the year, hastened the attack which\r\noccurred soon after, with its warning to Agassiz that his\r\novertasked brain could bear no farther strain. The first seizure,\r\nof short duration, but affecting speech and motion while it lasted,\r\nwas followed by others which became less and less acute until they\r\nfinally disappeared. For months, however, he was shut up in his\r\nroom, absolutely withdrawn from every intellectual effort, and\r\nforbidden by his physicians even to think. The fight with his own\r\nbrain was his greatest difficulty, and perhaps he showed as much\r\npower in compelling his active intellect to stultify itself in\r\nabsolute inactivity for the time, as he had ever shown in giving it\r\nfree rein. Yet he could not always banish the Museum, the\r\npassionate dream of his American life. One day, after dictating\r\nsome necessary directions concerning it, he exclaimed, with a sort\r\nof despairing cry, \"Oh, my Museum! my Museum! always uppermost, by\r\nday and by night, in health and in sickness, always--ALWAYS!\"\r\n\r\nHe was destined, however, to a few more years of activity, the\r\nreward, perhaps, of his patient and persistent struggle for\r\nrecovery. After a winter of absolute seclusion, passed in his sick\r\nchamber, he was allowed by his physician, in the spring of 1870, to\r\nseek change at the quiet village of Deerfield on the Connecticut\r\nRiver. Nature proved the best physician. Unable when he arrived to\r\ntake more than a few steps without vertigo, he could, before many\r\nweeks were over, walk several miles a day. Keen as an Egyptologist\r\nfor the hieroglyphics of his science, he was soon deciphering the\r\nlocal inscriptions of the glacial period, tracking the course of\r\nthe ice on slab and dike and river-bed,--on every natural surface.\r\nThe old music sang again in his ear and wooed him back to life.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, his assistants and students were doing all in\r\ntheir power to keep the work of the Museum at high-water mark. The\r\npublications, the classification and arrangement of the more recent\r\ncollections, the distribution of such portions as were intended for\r\nthe public, the system of exchanges, went on uninterruptedly. The\r\nworking force at the Museum was, indeed, now very strong. In great\r\ndegree it was, so to speak, home-bred. Agassiz had gradually\r\ngathered about him, chiefly from among his more special students, a\r\nstaff of assistants who were familiar with his plans and shared his\r\nenthusiasm. To these young friends he was warmly attached. It would\r\nbe impossible to name them all, but the knot of younger men who\r\nwere for years his daily associates in scientific work, whose\r\nsympathy and cooperation he so much valued, and who are now in\r\ntheir turn growing old in the service of science, will read the\r\nroll-call between the lines, and know that none are forgotten here.\r\nYears before his own death, he had the pleasure of seeing several\r\nof them called to important scientific positions, and it was a\r\ncogent evidence to him of the educational efficiency of the Museum,\r\nthat it had supplied to the country so many trained investigators\r\nand teachers. Through them he himself teaches still. There was a\r\nprophecy in Lowell's memorial lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"He was a Teacher: why be grieved for him\r\n    Whose living word still stimulates the air?\r\n    In endless file shall loving scholars come,\r\n    The glow of his transmitted touch to share.\"\r\n\r\nBeside these, there were several older, experienced naturalists,\r\nwho were permanently or transiently engaged at the Museum. Some\r\nwere heads of departments, while others lent assistance\r\noccasionally in special work. Again the list is too long for\r\nenumeration, but as the veteran among the older men Mr. J.G.\r\nAnthony should be remembered. Already a conchologist of forty\r\nyears' standing when he came to the Museum in 1863, he devoted\r\nhimself to the institution until the day of his death, twenty years\r\nlater. Among those who came to give occasional help were Mr.\r\nLesquereux, the head of paleontological botany in this country; M.\r\nJules Marcou, the geologist; and M. de Pourtales, under whose care\r\nthe collection of corals was constantly improved and enlarged. The\r\nlast named became at last wholly attached to the Museum, sharing\r\nits administration with Alexander Agassiz after his father's death.\r\n\r\nTo this band of workers some accessions had recently been made.\r\nMore than two years before, Agassiz had been so fortunate as to\r\nsecure the assistance of the entomologist, Dr. Hermann Hagen, from\r\nKonigsberg, Prussia. He came at first only for a limited time, but\r\nhe remained, and still remains, at the Museum, becoming more and\r\nmore identified with the institution, beside filling a place as\r\nprofessor in Harvard University. His scientific sympathy and\r\nsupport were of the greatest value to Agassiz during the rest of\r\nhis life. A later new-corner, and a very important one at the\r\nMuseum, was Dr. Franz Steindachner, of Vienna, who arrived in the\r\nspring of 1870 to put in final order the collection of Brazilian\r\nfishes, and passed two years in this country. Thus Agassiz's hands\r\nwere doubly strengthened. Beside having the service of the salaried\r\nassistants and professors, the Museum received much gratuitous aid.\r\nAmong the scientific volunteers were numbered for years Francois de\r\nPourtales, Theodore Lyman, James M. Barnard, and Alexander Agassiz,\r\nwhile the business affairs of the institution were undertaken by\r\nThomas G. Cary, Agassiz's brother-in-law. The latter had long been\r\nof great service to the Museum as collector on the Pacific coast,\r\nwhere he had made this work his recreation in the leisure hours of\r\na merchant's life.* (* For the history of the Museum in later times\r\nreference is made to the regular reports and publications of the\r\ninstitution.)\r\n\r\nBroken as he was in health, it is amazing to see the amount of work\r\ndone or directed by Agassiz during this convalescent summer of\r\n1870. The letters written by him in this time concerning the Museum\r\nalone would fill a good-sized volume. Such a correspondence is\r\nunfit for reproduction here, but its minuteness shows that almost\r\nthe position of every specimen, and the daily, hourly work of every\r\nindividual in the Museum, were known to him. The details of\r\nadministration form, however, but a small part of the material of\r\nthis correspondence. The consideration and discussion of the future\r\nof the Museum with those most nearly concerned, fill many of the\r\nletters. They give evidence of a fostering and far-reaching care,\r\nwhich provided for the growth and progress of the Museum, long\r\nafter his own share in it should have ceased.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Agassiz's scientific life in the United States, its\r\nbrilliant successes, and the genial generous support which it\r\nreceived in this country, it is natural to give prominence to the\r\nbrighter side. And yet it must not be forgotten that like all men\r\nwhose ideals outrun the means of execution, he had moments of\r\nintense depression and discouragement. Some of his letters, written\r\nat this time to friends who controlled the financial policy of the\r\nMuseum, are almost like a plea for life. While the trustees urge\r\nsafe investments and the expenditure of income alone, he believes\r\nthat in proportion to the growth and expansion of the Museum will\r\nbe its power of self-maintenance and its claim on the community at\r\nlarge. In short, expenditure seemed to him the best investment,\r\ninsuring a fair return, on the principle that the efficiency and\r\nusefulness of an institution will always be the measure of the\r\nsupport extended to it. The two or three following letters, in\r\nanswer to letters from Agassiz which cannot be found, show how\r\nearnestly, in spite of physical depression, he strove to keep the\r\nMuseum in relation with foreign institutions, to strengthen the\r\nformer, and cooperate as far as possible with the latter.\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR VON SIEBOLD.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, 1869.\r\n\r\n. . .Most gladly shall I meet your wishes both with regard to the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Central Europe and to your desire for the\r\nmeans of direct comparison between the fishes brought by Spix from\r\nBrazil and described by you, and those you have recently yourself\r\ncollected in the Amazons. The former, with one exception, are still\r\nin existence and remain undisturbed, for since your day no one has\r\ncared to work at the fishes or reptiles. Schubert took no interest\r\nin the zoological cabinet intrusted to him; and Wagner, who later\r\nrelieved him of its management, cared chiefly for the mammals. I\r\nhave now, however, given particular attention to the preservation\r\nof everything determined by you, so far as it could be found, and\r\nam truly glad that this material is again to be called into the\r\nservice of science. Of course I had to ask permission of the\r\n\"General Conservatorium of Scientific Collections\" before sending\r\nthis property of the state on so long a journey. At my urgent\r\nrequest this permission was very cordially granted by Herr von\r\nLiebig, especially as our collection is likely to be increased by\r\nthe new forms you offer us.\r\n\r\nAs to the fresh-water fishes I must beg for a little time. At the\r\nfish market, in April or May, I can find those Cyprinoids, the\r\nmales of which bear at the spawning season that characteristic\r\neruption of the skin, which has so often and so incorrectly led to\r\nthe making of new species. . .\r\n\r\nFrom your son Alexander I receive one beautiful work after another.\r\nGive him my best thanks for these admirable gifts, which I enter\r\nwith sincere pleasure in my catalogue of books. You are indeed\r\nhappy to have such a co-worker at your side. At the next\r\nopportunity I shall write my thanks to him personally.\r\n\r\nHow is Dr. Hermann Hagen pleased with his new position? I think the\r\npresence of this superior entomologist will exert a powerful and\r\nimportant influence upon the development of entomology in North\r\nAmerica. . .\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR G.P. DESHAYES.\r\n\r\nMUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, PARIS, February 4, 1870.\r\n\r\nYour letter was truly an event, my dear friend, not only for me but\r\nfor our Museum. . .How happy you are, and how enviable has been\r\nyour scientific career, since you have had your home in free\r\nAmerica! The founder of a magnificent institution, to which your\r\nglorious name will forever remain attached, you have the means of\r\ncarrying out whatever undertaking commends itself to you as useful.\r\nMen and things, following the current that sets toward you, are\r\ndrawn to your side. You desire, and you see your desires carried\r\nout. You are the sovereign leader of the scientific movement around\r\nyou, of which you yourself have been the first promoter.\r\n\r\nWhat would our old Museum not have gained in having at its head a\r\nman like you! We should not now be lying stagnant in a space so\r\ninsufficient that our buildings, by the mere force of\r\ncircumstances, are transformed into store-houses, where objects of\r\nstudy are heaped together, and can be of no use to any one. . .You\r\ncan fancy how much I envy your organization. It depressed me to\r\nread your letter, with its brilliant proposals of exchange,\r\nremembering how powerless we are to meet even a small number of\r\nthem. Your project is certainly an admirable one; to find the\r\nscientific nomenclature where it is best established, and by the\r\nhelp of good specimens transport it to your own doors. Nothing\r\ncould be better, and I would gladly assist in it. But to succeed in\r\nthis excellent enterprise one must have good duplicate specimens;\r\nnot having them, one must have money. As a conclusion to your\r\nletter, the question of money was brought before my assembled\r\ncolleagues, but the answer was vague and uncertain. I must, then,\r\nfind resources in some other way, and this is what I propose to do\r\n. . .[Here follow some plans for exchange.] Beside this, I will\r\nbusy myself in getting together authentic collections from our\r\nFrench seas, both Oceanic and Mediterranean, and even from other\r\npoints in the European seas. Meantime, you shall have your share\r\nhenceforth in whatever comes to me. . .I learn from your son that\r\nyour health is seriously attacked. I was grieved to hear it. Take\r\ncare of yourself, my dear friend. You are still needed in this\r\nworld; you have a great work to accomplish, the end and aim of\r\nwhich you alone are able to reach. You must, therefore, still stand\r\nin the breach for some years to come.\r\n\r\nYour letter, which shows me the countless riches you have to offer\r\nat the Museum, puts me in the frame of mind of the child who was\r\noffered his choice in a toy-shop. \"I choose everything,\" he said. I\r\ncould reply in the same way. I choose all you offer me. Still, one\r\nmust be reasonable, and I will therefore name, as the thing I\r\nchiefly desire, the remarkable fauna dredged from the Gulf Stream.\r\nLet me add, however, in order to give you entire freedom, that\r\nwhatever you may send to the Museum will be received with sincere\r\nand ardent gratitude.\r\n\r\nAnd so, farewell, my dear friend, with a warm shake of the hand and\r\nthe most cordial regard.\r\n\r\nDESHAYES.\r\n\r\nThe next is in answer to a letter from Agassiz to the veteran\r\nnaturalist, Professor Sedgwick, concerning casts of well-known\r\nfossil specimens in Cambridge, England. Though the casts were\r\nunattainable, the affectionate reply gave Agassiz keen pleasure.\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR ADAM SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE, NORWICH, August 9, 1871.\r\n\r\nMY VERY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND,\r\n\r\n. . .I of course showed your letter to my friend Seeley, and after\r\nsome consultation with men of practical knowledge, it was\r\nconsidered almost impossible to obtain such casts of the reptilian\r\nbones as you mention. The specimens of the bones are generally so\r\nrugged and broken, that the artists would find it extremely\r\ndifficult to make casts from them without the risk of damaging\r\nthem, and the authorities of the university, who are the\r\nproprietors of the whole collection in my Museum, would be\r\nunwilling to encounter that risk. Mr. Seeley, however, fully\r\nintends to send you a gutta-percha cast of the cerebral cavity of\r\none of our important specimens described in \"Seeley's Catalogue,\"\r\nbut he is full of engagements and may not hitherto have realized\r\nhis intentions. As for myself, at present I can do nothing except\r\nhobble daily on my stick from my house to the Cathedral, for I am\r\nafflicted by a painful lameness in my left knee. The load of years\r\nbegins to press upon me (I am now toiling through my 87th year),\r\nand my sight is both dim and irritable, so that, as a matter of\r\nnecessity, I am generally compelled to employ an amanuensis. That\r\npart is now filled by a niece who is to me in the place of a dear\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you that the meetings of the British Association\r\nare still continued, and the last session (this year at Edinburgh)\r\nonly ended yesterday. Let me correct a mistake. I met you first at\r\nEdinburgh in 1834, the year I became Canon, and again at Dublin in\r\n1835. . .It is a great pleasure to me, my dear friend, to see again\r\nby the vision of memory that fine youthful person, that benevolent\r\nface, and to hear again, as it were, the cheerful ring of the sweet\r\nand powerful voice by which you made the old Scotchmen start and\r\nstare, while you were bringing to life again the fishes of their\r\nold red sandstone. I must be content with the visions of memory and\r\nthe feelings they again kindle in my heart, for it will never be my\r\nhappiness to see your face again in this world. But let me, as a\r\nChristian man, hope that we may meet hereafter in heaven, and see\r\nsuch visions of God's glory in the moral and material universe, as\r\nshall reduce to a mere germ everything which has been elaborated by\r\nthe skill of man, or revealed to God's creatures. I send you an old\r\nman's blessing, and remain,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nADAM SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1870, Agassiz was able to return to Cambridge and the\r\nMuseum, and even to resume his lectures, which were as vigorous and\r\nfresh as ever. So entirely did he seem to have recovered, that in\r\nthe course of the winter the following proposition was made to him\r\nby his friend, Professor Benjamin Peirce, then Superintendent of\r\nthe Coast Survey.\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR PEIRCE.\r\n\r\nCOAST SURVEY OFFICE, WASHINGTON, February 18, 1871.\r\n\r\n. . .I met Sumner in the Senate the day before yesterday, and he\r\nexpressed immense delight at a letter he had received from\r\nBrown-Sequard, telling him that you were altogether free from\r\ndisease. . .Now, my dear friend, I have a very serious proposition\r\nfor you. I am going to send a new iron surveying steamer round to\r\nCalifornia in the course of the summer. She will probably start at\r\nthe end of June. Would you go in her, and do deep-sea dredging all\r\nthe way round? If so, what companions will you take? If not, who\r\nshall go?. . .\r\n\r\nFROM AGASSIZ TO PROFESSOR PEIRCE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 20, 1871.\r\n\r\n. . .I am overjoyed at the prospect your letter opens before me. Of\r\ncourse I will go, unless Brown-Sequard orders me positively to stay\r\non terra firma. But even then, I should like to have a hand in\r\narranging the party, as I feel there never was, and is not likely\r\nsoon again to be, such an opportunity for promoting the cause of\r\nscience generally, and that of natural history in particular. I\r\nwould like Pourtales and Alex to be of the party, and both would\r\ngladly join if they can. Both are as much interested about it as I\r\nam, and I have no doubt between us we may organize a working team,\r\nstrong enough to do something creditable. It seems to me that the\r\nbest plan to pursue in the survey would be to select carefully a\r\nfew points (as many as time would allow) on shore, from which to\r\nwork at right angles with the coast, to as great a distance as the\r\nresults would justify, and then move on to some other head-land. If\r\nthis plan be adopted, it would be desirable to have one additional\r\nobserver to make collections on shore, to connect with the result\r\nof the dredgings. This would be the more important as, with the\r\nexception of Brazil, hardly anything is known of the shore faunae\r\nupon the greater part of the South American coast. For shore\r\nobservations I should like a man of the calibre of Dr.\r\nSteindachner, who has spent a year on the coast of Senegal, and\r\nwould thus bring a knowledge of the opposite side of the Atlantic\r\nas a starting basis of comparison. . .\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with his physicians, it was decided that Agassiz\r\nmight safely undertake the voyage in the Hassler, that it might\r\nindeed be of benefit to his health. His party of naturalists, as\r\nfinally made up, consisted of Agassiz himself, Count de Pourtales,\r\nDr. Franz Steindachner, and Mr. Blake, a young student from the\r\nMuseum, who accompanied Agassiz as assistant and draughtsman. Dr.\r\nThomas Hill, ex-president of Harvard University, was also on the\r\nexpedition, and though engaged in special investigations of his\r\nown, he joined in all the work with genial interest. The vessel was\r\ncommanded by Captain (now Commodore) Philip C. Johnson, whose\r\ncourtesy and kindness made the Hassler a floating home to the\r\nguests on board. So earnest and active was the sympathy felt by him\r\nand his officers in the scientific interests of the expedition,\r\nthat they might be counted as a valuable additional volunteer\r\ncorps. Among them should be counted Dr. William White, of\r\nPhiladelphia, who accompanied the expedition in a partly\r\nprofessional, partly scientific capacity.\r\n\r\nThe hopes Agassiz had formed of this expedition, as high as those\r\nof any young explorer, were only partially fulfilled. His\r\nenthusiasm, though it had the ardor of youth, had none of its\r\nvagueness. In a letter to Mr. Peirce, published in the Museum\r\nBulletin at this time, there is this passage: \"If this world of\r\nours is the work of intelligence and not merely the product of\r\nforce and matter, the human mind, as a part of the whole, should so\r\nchime with it, that from what is known it may reach the unknown. If\r\nthis be so, the knowledge gathered should, within the limits of\r\nerror which its imperfection renders unavoidable, enable us to\r\nforetell what we are likely to find in the deepest abysses of the\r\nsea.\" He looked, in short, for the solution of special problems\r\ndirectly connected with all his previous work. He believed the\r\ndeeper sea would show forms of life akin to animals of earlier\r\ngeological times, throwing new light on the relation between the\r\nfossil and the living world. In the letter above quoted, he even\r\nnamed the species he expected to find most prevalent in those\r\ngreater depths: as, for instance, representatives of the older\r\nforms of Ganoids and Selachians; Cephalopods, resembling the more\r\nancient chambered shells; Gasteropods, recalling the tertiary and\r\ncretaceous types; and Acephala, resembling those of the jurassic\r\nand cretaceous formations. He expected to find Crustaceans also,\r\nmore nearly approaching the ancient Trilobites than those now\r\nliving on the surface of the globe; and among Radiates he looked\r\nfor the older forms of sea-urchins, star-fishes, and corals.\r\nAlthough the collections brought together on this cruise were rich\r\nand interesting, they gave but imperfect answers to these\r\ncomprehensive questions. Owing to defects in the dredging\r\napparatus, the hauls from the greatest depths were lost.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the glacial period he anticipated still more\r\npositive results. In the same letter the following passage occurs:\r\n\"There is, however, still one kind of evidence wanting, to remove\r\nall doubt that the greater extension of glaciers in former ages was\r\nconnected with cosmic changes in the physical condition of our\r\nglobe. Namely, all the phenomena relating to the glacial period\r\nmust be found in the southern hemisphere, accompanied by the same\r\ncharacteristic features as in the north, but with this essential\r\ndifference,--that everything must be reversed. The trend of the\r\nglacial abrasions must be from the south northward, the lee-side of\r\nabraded rocks must be on the north side of the hills and mountain\r\nranges, and the boulders must have traveled from the south to their\r\npresent position. Whether this be so or not, has not yet been\r\nascertained by direct observation. I expect to find it so\r\nthroughout the temperate and cold zones of the southern hemisphere,\r\nwith the exception of the present glaciers of Terra del Fuego and\r\nPatagonia, which may have transported boulders in every direction.\r\nEven in Europe, geologists have not yet sufficiently discriminated\r\nbetween local glaciers and the phenomena connected with their\r\ndifferent degrees of successive retreat on the one hand; and, on\r\nthe other, the facts indicating the action of an extensive sheet of\r\nice moving over the whole continent from north to south. Among the\r\nfacts already known from the southern hemisphere are the so-called\r\nrivers of stone in the Falkland Islands, which attracted the\r\nattention of Darwin during his cruise with Captain Fitzroy, and\r\nwhich have remained an enigma to this day. I believe it will not be\r\ndifficult to explain their origin in the light of the glacial\r\ntheory, and I fancy they may turn out to be ground moraines similar\r\nto the 'horsebacks' in Maine.\r\n\r\n\"You may ask what this question of drift has to do with deep-sea\r\ndredging? The connection is closer than may at first appear. If\r\ndrift is not of glacial origin, but is the product of marine\r\ncurrents, its formation at once becomes a matter for the Coast\r\nSurvey to investigate. But I believe it will be found in the end,\r\nthat so far from being accumulated by the sea, the drift of the\r\nPatagonian lowlands has been worn away by the sea to its present\r\noutline, like the northern shores of South America and Brazil.\". . .\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for a detailed account of the voyage of the\r\nHassler, but enough may be told to show something of Agassiz's own\r\nshare in it. A journal of scientific and personal experience, kept\r\nby Mrs. Agassiz under his direction, was nearly ready for\r\npublication at the time of his death. The two next chapters,\r\ndevoted to the cruise of the Hassler, are taken from that\r\nmanuscript. A portion of it appeared many years ago in the pages of\r\nthe \"Atlantic Monthly.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23.\r\n\r\n1871-1872: AGE 64-65.\r\n\r\nSailing of the Hassler.\r\nSargassum Fields.\r\nDredging at Barbados.\r\nFrom the West Indies to Rio de Janeiro.\r\nMonte Video.\r\nQuarantine.\r\nGlacial Traces in the Bay of Monte Video.\r\nThe Gulf of Mathias.\r\nDredging off Gulf of St. George.\r\nDredging off Cape Virgens.\r\nPossession Bay.\r\nSalt Pool.\r\nMoraine.\r\nSandy Point.\r\nCruise through the Straits.\r\nScenery.\r\nWind Storm.\r\nBorja Bay.\r\nGlacier Bay.\r\nVisit to the Glacier.\r\nChorocua Bay.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was to have started in August, but, owing to various\r\ndelays in her completion, she was not ready for sea until the late\r\nautumn. She finally sailed on December 4, 1871, on a gray\r\nafternoon, which ushered in the first snow-storm of the New England\r\nwinter. Bound for warmer skies, she was, however, soon in the\r\nwaters of the Gulf Stream, where the work of collecting began in\r\nthe fields of Sargassum, those drifting, wide-spread expanses of\r\nloose sea-weed carrying a countless population, lilliputian in\r\nsize, to be sure, but very various in character. Agassiz was no\r\nless interested than other naturalists have been in the old\r\nquestion so long asked and still unanswered, about the Sargassum.\r\n\"Where is its home, and what its origin? Does it float, a rootless\r\nwanderer on the deep, or has it broken away from some submarine\r\nattachment?\" He had passed through the same region before, in going\r\nto Brazil, but then he was on a large ocean steamer, while from the\r\nlittle Hassler, of 360 tons, one could almost fish by hand from the\r\nSargassum fields. Some of the chief results are given in the\r\nfollowing letter.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR PEIRCE.\r\n\r\nST. THOMAS, December 15, 1871.\r\n\r\n. . .As soon as we reached the Gulf Stream we began work. Indeed,\r\nPourtales had organized a party to study the temperatures as soon\r\nas we passed Gay Head, and will himself report to you his results.\r\nMy own attention was entirely turned to the Gulf weed and its\r\ninhabitants, of which we made extensive collections. Our\r\nobservations on the floating weed itself favor the view of those\r\nwho believe it to be torn from rocks, on which Sargassum naturally\r\ngrows. I made a simple experiment which seems to me conclusive. Any\r\nbranch of the sea-weed which is deprived of its FLOATS sinks at\r\nonce to the bottom of the water, and these floats are not likely to\r\nbe the first parts developed from the spores. Moreover, after\r\nexamining large quantities of the weed, I have not seen a single\r\nbranch, however small, which did not show marks of having been torn\r\nfrom a solid attachment.\r\n\r\nYou may hardly feel an interest in my zoological observations, but\r\nI am sure you will be glad to learn that we had the best\r\nopportunity of carefully examining most of the animals known to\r\ninhabit the Gulf weed, and some also which I did not know to occur\r\namong them. The most interesting discovery of our voyage thus far,\r\nhowever, is that of a nest built by a fish, and floating on the\r\nbroad ocean with its living freight. On the 13th, Mr. Mansfield,\r\none of our officers, brought me a ball of Gulf weed which he had\r\njust picked up, and which excited my curiosity to the utmost. It\r\nwas a round mass of Sargassum about the size of two fists. The bulk\r\nof the ball was made up of closely packed branches and leaves, held\r\ntogether by fine threads, running through them in every direction,\r\nwhile other branches hung more loosely from the margin. Placed in a\r\nlarge bowl of water it became apparent that the loose branches\r\nserved to keep the central mass floating, cradle-like, between\r\nthem. The elastic threads, which held the ball of Gulf weed\r\ntogether, were beaded at intervals, sometimes two or three beads\r\nclose together, or a bunch of them hanging from the same cluster of\r\nthreads, or occasionally scattered at a greater distance from each\r\nother. Nowhere was there much regularity in the distribution of the\r\nbeads. They were scattered pretty uniformly throughout the whole\r\nball of seaweed, and were themselves about the size of an ordinary\r\npin's head. Evidently we had before us a nest of the most curious\r\nkind, full of eggs. What animal could have built this singular\r\nnest? It did not take long to ascertain the class to which it\r\nbelonged. A common pocket lens revealed at once two large eyes on\r\nthe side of the head, and a tail bent over the back of the body, as\r\nin the embryo of ordinary fishes shortly before the period of\r\nhatching. The many empty egg cases in the nest gave promise of an\r\nearly opportunity of seeing some embryos, freeing themselves from\r\ntheir envelope. Meanwhile a number of these eggs containing live\r\nembryos were cut out of the nest and placed in separate glass jars,\r\nin order to multiply the chances of preserving them; while the nest\r\nas a whole was secured in alcohol, as a memorial of our discovery.\r\n\r\nThe next day I found two embryos in my glass jars; they moved\r\noccasionally in jerks, and then rested a long time motionless on\r\nthe bottom of the jar. On the third day I had over a dozen of these\r\nyoung fishes, the oldest beginning to be more active. I need not\r\nrelate in detail the evidence I soon obtained that these embryos\r\nwere actually fishes. . .But what kind of fish was it? At about the\r\ntime of hatching, the fins differ too much from those of the adult,\r\nand the general form has too few peculiarities, to give any clew to\r\nthis problem. I could only suppose it would prove to be one of the\r\npelagic species of the Atlantic. In former years I had made a\r\ncareful study of the pigment cells of the skin in a variety of\r\nyoung fishes, and I now resorted to this method to identify my\r\nembryos. Happily we had on board several pelagic fishes alive. The\r\nvery first comparison I made gave the desired result. The pigment\r\ncell of a young Chironectes pictus proved identical with those of\r\nour little embryos. It thus stands, as a well authenticated fact,\r\nthat the common pelagic Chironectes of the Atlantic, named Ch.\r\npictus by Cuvier, builds a nest for its eggs in which the progeny\r\nis wrapped up with the materials of which the nest itself is\r\ncomposed; and as these materials consist of the living Gulf weed,\r\nthe fish cradle, rocking upon the deep ocean, is carried along as\r\nin an arbor, which affords protection and afterwards food also, to\r\nits living freight. This marvelous story acquires additional\r\ninterest, when we consider the characteristic peculiarities of the\r\ngenus Chironectes. As its name indicates, it has fin-like hands;\r\nthat is to say, the pectoral fins are supported by a kind of long\r\nwrist-like appendage, and the rays of the ventrals are not unlike\r\nrude fingers. With these limbs these fishes have long been known to\r\nattach themselves to sea-weeds, and rather to walk than to swim in\r\ntheir natural element. But now that we know their mode of\r\nreproduction, it may fairly be asked if the most important use of\r\ntheir peculiarly constructed fins is not the building of their\r\nnest?. . .There thus remains one closing chapter to the story. May\r\nsome naturalist, becalmed among the Gulf weed, have the good\r\nfortune to witness the process by which the nest is built. . .\r\n\r\nThis whole investigation was of the greatest interest to Agassiz,\r\nand, coming so early in the voyage, seemed a pleasant promise of\r\nits farther opportunities. The whole ship's company soon shared his\r\nenthusiasm, and the very sailors gathered about him in the\r\nintervals of their work, or hung on the outskirts of the scientific\r\ncircle. A pause of a few days was made at one or two of the West\r\nIndian islands, at St. Thomas and Barbados. At the latter, the\r\nfirst cast of the large dredge was made on a ledge of shoals in a\r\ndepth of eighty fathoms, and, among countless other things, a\r\nnumber of stemmed crinoids and comatulae were brought up. An ardent\r\nstudent of the early fossil echinoderms, it was a great pleasure to\r\nAgassiz to gather their fresh and living representatives. It was\r\nlike turning a leaf of the past and finding the subtle thread which\r\nconnects it with the present.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR PEIRCE.\r\n\r\nPERNAMBUCO, January 16, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PEIRCE,\r\n\r\nI should have written to you from Barbados, but the day before we\r\nleft the island was favorable for dredging, and our success in that\r\nline was so unexpectedly great, that I could not get away from the\r\nspecimens, and made the most of them for study while I had the\r\nchance. We made only four hauls, in between seventy-five and one\r\nhundred and twenty fathoms. But what hauls! Enough to occupy half a\r\ndozen competent zoologists for a whole year, if the specimens could\r\nbe kept fresh for that length of time. The first haul brought up a\r\nChemidium-like sponge; the next gave us a crinoid, very much like\r\nthe Rhizocrinus lofotensis, but probably different; the third, a\r\nliving Pleurotomaria; the fourth, a new genus of Spatangoids, etc.,\r\netc., not to speak of the small fry. We had the crinoid alive for\r\nten or twelve hours. When contracted, the pinnules are pressed\r\nagainst the arms, and the arms themselves shut against one another,\r\nso that the whole looks like a swash made up of a few long, coarse\r\ntwines. When the animal opens, the arms at first separate without\r\nbending outside, so that the whole looks like an inverted pentapod;\r\nbut gradually the tips of the arms bend outward as the arms diverge\r\nmore and more, and when fully expanded the crown has the appearance\r\nof a lily of the L. martagon type, in which each petal is curved\r\nupon itself, the pinnules of the arms spreading laterally more and\r\nmore, as the crown is more fully open. I have not been able to\r\ndetect any motion in the stem traceable to contraction, though\r\nthere is no stiffness in its bearing. When disturbed, the pinnules\r\nof the arms first contract, the arms straighten themselves out, and\r\nthe whole gradually and slowly closes up. It was a very impressive\r\nsight for me to watch the movements of the creature, for it not\r\nonly told of its own ways, but at the same time afforded a glimpse\r\ninto the countless ages of the past, when these crinoids, so rare\r\nand so rarely seen nowadays, formed a prominent feature of the\r\nanimal kingdom. I could see, without great effort of the\r\nimagination, the shoal of Lockport teeming with the many genera of\r\ncrinoids which the geologists of New York have rescued from that\r\nprolific Silurian deposit, or recall the formations of my native\r\ncountry, in the hill-sides of which also, among fossils indicating\r\nshoal water deposits, other crinoids abound, resembling still more\r\nclosely those we find in these waters. The close affinities of\r\nRhizocrinus with Apiocrinoids are further exemplified by the fact\r\nthat when the animal dies, it casts off its arms, like Apiocrinus,\r\nthe head of which is generally found without arms. And now the\r\nquestion may be asked, what is the meaning of the occurrence of\r\nthese animals in deep waters at the present day, when, in former\r\nages, similar types inhabited shallow seas? Of the fact there can\r\nbe no doubt, for it is not difficult to adduce satisfactory\r\nevidence of the shoal-like character of the Silurian deposits of\r\nthe State of New York; their horizontal position, combined with the\r\ngradual recession of the higher beds in a southerly direction,\r\nleaves no doubt upon this point; and in the case of the jurassic\r\nformation alluded to above, the combination of the crinoids with\r\nfossils common upon coral reefs, and their presence in atolls of\r\nthat period, are satisfactory proofs of my assertion. What does it\r\nmean, then, when we find the Pentacrinus and Rhizocrinus of the\r\nWest Indies in deep water only? It seems to me that there is but\r\none explanation of the fact, namely, that in the progress of the\r\nearth's growth, we must look for such a displacement of the\r\nconditions favorable to the maintenance of certain lower types, as\r\nmay recall most fully the adaptations of former ages. It was in\r\nthis sense I alluded, in my first letter to you, to the probability\r\nof our finding in deeper water representatives of earlier\r\ngeological types; and if my explanation is correct, my anticipation\r\nis also fully sustained. But do the deeper waters of the present\r\nconstitution of our globe really approximate the conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of animal life, which existed in the shallower seas of\r\npast geological ages? I think they do, or at least I believe they\r\napproach it as nearly as anything can in the present order of\r\nthings upon earth; for the depths of the ocean alone can place\r\nanimals under a pressure corresponding to that caused by the heavy\r\natmosphere of earlier periods. But, of course, such high pressure\r\nas animals meet in great depths cannot be a favorable condition for\r\nthe development of life; hence the predominance of lower forms in\r\nthe deep sea. The rapid diminution of light with the increasing\r\ndepth, and the small amount of free oxygen in these waters under\r\ngreater and greater pressure, not to speak of other limitations\r\narising from the greater uniformity of the conditions of existence,\r\nthe reduced amount and less variety of nutritive substances, etc.,\r\netc., are so many causes acting in the same direction and with\r\nsimilar results. For all these reasons, I have always expected to\r\nfind that the animals living in great depths would prove to be of a\r\nstanding, in the scale of structural complications, inferior to\r\nthose found in shoal waters or near shore; and the correlation\r\nelsewhere pointed out between the standing of animals and their\r\norder of succession in geological times (see \"Essay on\r\nClassification \") justifies another form of expression of these\r\nfacts, namely, that in deeper waters we should expect to find\r\nrepresentatives of earlier geological periods. There is in all this\r\nnothing which warrants the conclusion that any of the animals now\r\nliving are lineal descendants of those of earlier ages; nor does\r\ntheir similarity to those of earlier periods justify the statement\r\nthat the cretaceous formation is still extant. It would be just as\r\ntrue to nature to say that the tertiaries are continued in the\r\ntropics, on account of the similarity of the miocene mammalia to\r\nthose of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nWe have another case in the Pleurotomaria. It is not long since it\r\nhas been made known that the genus Pleurotomaria is not altogether\r\nextinct, a single specimen having been discovered about ten years\r\nago in the West Indies. Even Pictet, in the second edition of his\r\nPaleontology, still considers Pleurotomaria as extinct, and as\r\nbelonging to the fossiliferous formations which extend from the\r\nSilurian period to the Tertiary. Of the living species found at\r\nMarie Galante, nothing is known except the specific characteristics\r\nof the shell. We dredged it in one hundred and twenty fathoms, on\r\nthe west side of Barbados, alive, and kept it alive for twenty-four\r\nhours, during which time the animal expanded and showed its\r\nremarkable peculiarities. It is unquestionably the type of a\r\ndistinct family, entirely different from the other Mollusks with\r\nwhich it has been hitherto associated. Mr. Blake has made fine\r\ncolored drawings of it, which may be published at some future\r\ntime. . .The family of the Pleurotomariae numbers between four and\r\nfive hundred fossil species, beginning in the Silurian deposits, but\r\nespecially numerous in the carboniferous and jurassic formations.\r\n\r\nThe sponges afford another interesting case. When the first number\r\nof the great work of Goldfuss, on the fossils of Germany, made its\r\nappearance, about half a century ago, the most novel types it made\r\nknown were several genera of sponges from the jurassic and\r\ncretaceous beds, described under the names of Siphonia, Chemidium,\r\nand Scyphia. Nothing of the kind has been known among the living to\r\nthis day; and yet, the first haul of the dredge near Barbados gave\r\nus a Chemidium, or, at least, a sponge so much like the fossil\r\nChemidium, that it must remain for future comparisons to determine\r\nwhether there are any generic differences between our living sponge\r\nand the fossil. The next day brought us a genuine Siphonia, another\r\ngenus thus far only known from the jurassic beds; and it is worth\r\nrecording, that I noticed in the collection of Governor Rawson\r\nanother sponge,--brought to him by a fisherman who had caught it on\r\nhis line, on the coast of Barbados,--which belongs to the genus\r\nScyphia. Thus the three characteristic genera of sponges from the\r\nsecondary formation, till now supposed to be extinct, are all three\r\nrepresented in the deep waters of the West Indies. . .\r\n\r\nAnother family of organized beings offers a similar testimony to\r\nthat already alluded to. If there is a type of Echinoderms\r\ncharacteristic of a geological period, it is the genus Micraster of\r\nthe cretaceous formation, in its original circumscription. No\r\nspecies of this genus is known to have existed during the Tertiary\r\nera, and no living species has as yet been made known. You may\r\ntherefore imagine my surprise when the dredge first yielded three\r\nspecimens of a small species of that particular group of the genus,\r\nwhich is most extensively represented in the upper cretaceous beds.\r\n\r\nOther examples of less importance might be enumerated; suffice it\r\nnow to add that my expectation of finding in deep waters animals\r\nalready known, but thus far exceedingly rare in museums, is already\r\nin a measure realised. . .\r\n\r\nLittle can be said of the voyage from the West Indies to Rio de\r\nJaneiro. It had the usual vicissitudes of weather, with here and\r\nthere a flight (so it might justly be called) of flying-fish, a\r\nschool of porpoises or dog-fish, or a sail in the distance, to\r\nbreak the monotony. At Rio de Janeiro it became evident that the\r\nplan of the voyage must be somewhat curtailed. This was made\r\nnecessary partly by the delays in starting,--in consequence of\r\nwhich the season would be less favorable than had been anticipated\r\nalong certain portions of the proposed route,--and partly by the\r\ndefective machinery, which had already given some trouble to the\r\nCaptain. The Falkland Islands, the Rio Negro, and the Santa Cruz\r\nrivers were therefore renounced; with what regret will be\r\nunderstood by those who know how hard it is to be forced to break\r\nup a scheme of work, which was originally connected in all its\r\nparts. The next pause was at Monte Video; but as there was a strict\r\nquarantine, Agassiz was only allowed to land at the Mount, a hill\r\non the western side of the bay, the geology of which he was anxious\r\nto examine. He found true erratics--loose pebbles, granite, gneiss,\r\nand granitic sandstone, having no resemblance to any native rock in\r\nthe vicinity--scattered over the whole surface of the hill to its\r\nvery summit. The hill itself had also the character of the \"roches\r\nmoutonnees\" modeled by ice in the northern hemisphere. As these\r\nwere the most northern erratics and glaciated surfaces reported in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, the facts there were very interesting to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith dredgings off the Rio de la Plata, and along the coast between\r\nthat and the Rio Negro, the vessel held on her way to the Gulf of\r\nMathias, a deep, broad bay running some hundred miles inland, and\r\nsituated a little south of the Rio Negro. Here some necessary\r\nrepairs enforced a pause, of which Agassiz took advantage for\r\ndredging and for studying the geology of the cliffs along the north\r\nside of the bay. As seen from the vessel, they seemed to be\r\nstratified with extraordinary evenness and regularity to within a\r\nfew feet of the top, the summit being crowned with loose sand.\r\nFarther on, they sank to sand dunes piled into rounded banks and\r\nsoftly moulded ledges, like snow-drifts. Landing the next day at a\r\nbold bluff marked Cliff End on the charts, he found the lower\r\nstratum to consist of a solid mass of tertiary fossils, chiefly\r\nimmense oysters, mingled, however, with sea-urchins. Superb\r\nspecimens were secured,--large boulders crowded with colossal\r\nshells and perfectly preserved echini. From the top of the cliff,\r\nlooking inland, only a level plain was seen, stretching as far as\r\nthe eye could reach, broken by no undulations, and covered with\r\nlow, scrubby growth. The seine was drawn on the beach, and yielded\r\na good harvest for the fish collection. At evening the vessel\r\nanchored at the head of the bay, off the Port of San Antonio. The\r\nname would seem to imply some settlement; but a more lonely spot\r\ncannot be imagined. More than thirty years ago, Fitzroy had sailed\r\nup this bay, partially surveyed it, and marked this harbor on his\r\nchart. If any vessel has broken the loneliness of its waters since,\r\nno record of any such event has been kept. Of the presence of man,\r\nthere was no sign. Yet the few days passed there were among the\r\npleasantest of the voyage to Agassiz. The work of the dredge and\r\nseine was extremely successful, and the rambles inland were\r\ngeological excursions of great interest. Here he had the first\r\nsight of the guanaco of the Patagonian plains. The weather was\r\nfine, and at night-fall, to the golden light of sunset succeeded\r\nthe fitful glow, over land and water, of the bonfires built by the\r\nsailors on the beach. Returning to the ship after dark, the various\r\nparties assembled in the wardroom, to talk over the events of the\r\nday and lay out plans for the morrow. These are the brightest hours\r\nin such a voyage, when the novelty of the locality gives a zest to\r\nevery walk or row, and all are full of interest in a new and\r\nexciting life. One is more tolerant even of monotonous natural\r\nfeatures in a country so isolated, so withdrawn from human life and\r\noccupation. The very barrenness seems in harmony with the intense\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nThe Hassler left her anchorage on this desolate shore on an evening\r\nof singular beauty. It was difficult to tell when she was on her\r\nway, so quietly did she move through the glassy waters, over which\r\nthe sun went down in burnished gold, leaving the sky without a\r\ncloud. The light of the beach fires followed her till they too\r\nfaded, and only the phosphorescence of the sea attended her into\r\nthe night. Rough and stormy weather followed this fair start, and\r\nonly two more dredgings were possible before reaching the Strait of\r\nMagellan. One was off the Gulf of St. George, where gigantic\r\nstar-fishes seemed to have their home. One of them, a superb\r\nbasket-fish, was not less than a foot and a half in diameter; and\r\nanother, like a huge sunflower of reddish purple tint, with\r\nstraight arms, thirty-seven in number, radiating from the disk, was\r\nof about the same size. Many beautiful little sea-urchins came up\r\nin the same dredging. About fifty miles north of Cape Virgens, in\r\ntolerably calm weather, another haul was tried, and this time the\r\ndredge returned literally solid with Ophiurans.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, March 13th, on a beautifully clear morning, like the\r\nbest October weather in New England, the Hassler rounded Cape\r\nVirgens and entered the Strait of Magellan. The tide was just on\r\nthe flood, and all the conditions favorable for her run to her\r\nfirst anchorage in the Strait at Possession Bay. Here the working\r\nforce divided, to form two shore parties, one of which, under\r\nAgassiz's direction, the reader may follow. The land above the\r\nfirst shore bluff at Possession Bay rises to a height of some four\r\nhundred feet above the sea-level, in a succession of regular\r\nhorizontal terraces, of which Agassiz counted eight. On these\r\nterraces, all of which are built, like the shore-bluffs, of\r\ntertiary deposits, were two curious remnants of a past state of\r\nthings. The first was a salt-pool lying in a depression on the\r\nsecond terrace, some one hundred and fifty feet above the sea. This\r\npool contained living marine shells, identical with those now found\r\nalong the shore. Among them were Fusus, Mytilus, Buccinum,\r\nFissurella, Patella, and Voluta, all found in the same numeric\r\nrelations as those in which they now exist upon the beach below.\r\nThis pool is altogether too high to be reached by any tidal\r\ninfluence, and undoubtedly indicates an old sea-level, and a\r\ncomparatively recent upheaval of the shore. The second was a\r\ngenuine moraine, corresponding in every respect to those which\r\noccur all over the northern hemisphere. Agassiz came upon it in\r\nascending to the third terrace above the salt-pool and a little\r\nfarther inland. It had all the character of a terminal moraine in\r\ncontact with an actual glacier. It was composed of heterogeneous\r\nmaterials,--large and small pebbles and boulders impacted together\r\nin a paste of clayey gravel and sand. The ice had evidently\r\nadvanced from the south, for the mass had been pushed steeply up on\r\nthe southern side, and retained so sharp an inclination on that\r\nface that but little vegetation had accumulated upon it. The\r\nnorthern side, on the contrary, was covered with soil and\r\novergrown; it sloped gently off,--pebbles and larger stones being\r\nscattered beyond it. The pebbles and boulders of this moraine were\r\npolished, scratched, and grooved, and bore, in short, all the usual\r\nmarks of glacial action. Agassiz was naturally delighted with this\r\ndiscovery. It was a new link in the chain of evidence, showing that\r\nthe drift phenomena are connected at the south as well as at the\r\nnorth with the action of ice, and that the frozen Arctic and\r\nAntarctic fields are but remnants of a sheet of ice, which has\r\nretreated from the temperate zones of both hemispheres to the polar\r\nregions. The party pushed on beyond the moraine to a hill of\r\nconsiderable height, which gave a fine view of the country toward\r\nMount Aymon and the so-called Asses' Ears. They brought back a\r\nvariety of game, but their most interesting scientific acquisitions\r\nwere boulders from the moraine scored with glacial characters, and\r\nshells from the salt pool.\r\n\r\nStill accompanied by beautiful weather, the Hassler anchored at the\r\nElizabeth Islands and at San Magdalena. Here Agassiz had an\r\nopportunity of examining the haunts and rookeries of the penguins\r\nand cormorants, and obtaining fine specimens of both. As the\r\nbreeding places and the modes of life of these animals have been\r\ndescribed by other travelers, there is nothing new to add from his\r\nimpressions, until the vessel anchored, on the 16th March, before\r\nSandy Point, the only permanent settlement in the Strait.\r\n\r\nHere there was a pause of several days, which gave Agassiz an\r\nopportunity to draw the seine with large results for his marine\r\ncollections. By the courtesy of the Governor, he had also an\r\nopportunity of making an excursion along the road leading to the\r\ncoal-mines. The wooded cliffs, as one ascends the hills toward the\r\nmines, are often bold and picturesque, and Agassiz found that\r\nportions of them were completely built of fossil shells. There is\r\nan oyster-bank, some one hundred feet high, overhanging the road in\r\nmassive ledges that consist wholly of oyster-valves, with only\r\nearth enough to bind them together. He was inclined, from the\r\ncharacter of the shells, to believe that the coal must be\r\ncretaceous rather than tertiary.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 19th March, the Hassler left Sandy Point. The\r\nweather was beautiful,--a mellow autumn day with a reminiscence of\r\nsummer in its genial warmth. The cleft summit of Sarmiento was\r\nclear against the sky, and the snow-fields, swept over by alternate\r\nlight and shadow, seemed full of soft undulations. The evening\r\nanchorage was in the Bay of Port Famine, a name which marks the\r\nsite of Sarmiento's ill-fated colony, and recalls the story of the\r\nmen who watched and waited there for the help that never came. The\r\nstay here was short, and Agassiz spent the time almost wholly in\r\nstudying the singularly regular, but completely upturned strata\r\nwhich line the beach, with edges so worn down as to be almost\r\ncompletely even with each other.\r\n\r\nFor many days after this, the Hassler pursued her course, past a\r\nseemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the\r\npale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every\r\nrift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to\r\njoin the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them.\r\nEvery night she anchored in the sheltered harbors formed by the\r\ninlets and fords which break the base of the rocky walls, and often\r\nlead into narrower ocean defiles penetrating, one knows not\r\nwhither, into the deeper heart of these great mountain masses.\r\n\r\nThese were weeks of exquisite delight to Agassiz. The vessel often\r\nskirted the shore so closely that its geology could be studied from\r\nthe deck. The rounded shoulders of the mountains, in marked\r\ncontrast to their peaked and jagged crests, the general character\r\nof the snow-fields and glaciers, not crowded into narrow valleys as\r\nin Switzerland, but spread out on the open slopes of the loftier\r\nranges, or, dome like, capping their summits,--all this afforded\r\ndata for comparison with his past experience, and with the\r\nknowledge he had accumulated upon like phenomena in other regions.\r\nHere, as in the Alps, the abrupt line, where the rounded and worn\r\nsurfaces of the mountains (moutonnees, as the Swiss say) yield to\r\ntheir sharply cut, jagged crests, showed him the ancient and\r\nhighest line reached by the glacial action. The long, serrated edge\r\nof Mount Tarn, for instance, is like a gigantic saw, while the\r\nlower shoulders of the mass are hummocked into a succession of\r\nrounded hills. In like manner the two beautiful valleys, separated\r\nby a bold bluff called Bachelor's Peak, are symmetrically rounded\r\non their slopes, while their summits are jagged and rough.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the Hassler encountered one of those sudden and\r\nstartling flaws of wind common to the Strait. The breeze, which had\r\nbeen strong all day, increased with sudden fury just as the vessel\r\nwas passing through a rather narrow channel, which gave the wind\r\nthe additional force of compression. In an inconceivably short\r\ntime, the channel was lashed into a white foam; the roar of wind\r\nand water was so great you could not hear yourself speak, though\r\nthe hoarse shout of command and the answering cry of the sailors\r\nrose above the storm. To add to the confusion, a loose sail slatted\r\nas if it would tear itself in pieces, with that sharp, angry,\r\nrending sound which only a broad spread of loose canvas can make.\r\nIt became impossible to hold the vessel against the amazing power\r\nof the blast, and the Captain turned her round with the intention\r\nof putting her into Borja Bay, not far from which, by good fortune,\r\nshe chanced to be. As she came broadside to the wind in turning, it\r\nseemed as if she must be blown over, so violently did she careen.\r\nOnce safely round, she flew before the wind, which now became her\r\nally instead of her enemy, and by its aid she was soon abreast of\r\nBorja Bay. Never was there a more sudden transition from chaos to\r\npeace than that which ensued as she turned in from the tumult in\r\nthe main channel to the quiet waters of the bay. The Hassler almost\r\nfilled the tiny harbor shut in between mountains. She lay there\r\nsafe and sheltered in breathless calm, while the storm raged and\r\nhowled outside. These frequent, almost land-locked coves, are the\r\nsafety of navigators in these straits; but after this day's\r\nexperience, it was easy to understand how sailing vessels may be\r\nkept waiting for months between two such harbors, struggling vainly\r\nto make a few miles and constantly driven back by sudden squalls.\r\n\r\nIn this exquisite mountain-locked harbor, the vessel was\r\nweather-bound for a couple of days. Count Pourtales availed himself\r\nof this opportunity to ascend one of the summits. Up to a height of\r\nfifteen hundred feet, the rock was characterized by the smoothed,\r\nrounded surfaces which Agassiz had observed along his whole route\r\nin the Strait. Above that height all was broken and rugged, the\r\nline of separation being as defined as on any valley wall in\r\nSwitzerland. It was again impossible to decide, on such short\r\nobservation, whether these effects were due to local glacial\r\naction, or whether they belonged to an earlier general ice-period.\r\nBut Agassiz became satisfied, as he advanced, that the two sets of\r\nphenomena existed together, as in the northern hemisphere. The\r\ngeneral aspect of the opposite walls of the Strait confirmed him in\r\nthe idea that the sheet of ice in its former extension had advanced\r\nfrom south to north, grinding its way against and over the southern\r\nwall to the plains beyond. In short, he was convinced that, as a\r\nsheet of ice has covered the northern portion of the globe, so a\r\nsheet of ice has covered also the southern portion, advancing, in\r\nboth instances, far toward the equatorial regions. His observations\r\nin Europe, in North America, and in Brazil seemed here to have\r\ntheir closing chapter.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in his mind, he did not fail to pause before\r\nGlacier Bay, noted for its immense glacier, which seems, as seen\r\nfrom the main channel, to plunge sheer down into the waters of the\r\nbay. A boat party was soon formed to accompany him to the glacier.\r\nIt proved less easy of access than it looked at a distance. A broad\r\nbelt of wood, growing, as Agassiz afterward found, on an\r\naccumulation of old terminal moraines, spanned the lower valley\r\nfrom side to side. Through this wood there poured a glacial river,\r\nemptying itself into the bay. Strange to say, this glacier-washed\r\nforest, touching the ice on one side and the sea on the other, was\r\nfull of flowers. The red bells of the glossy-leaved Desfontainia,\r\nthe lovely pink blossoms of the Phylesia, the crimson berries of\r\nthe Pennetia, stood out in bright relief from a background of mossy\r\ntree-trunks and rocks. After an hour's walking, made laborious by\r\nthe spongy character of the ground,--a mixture of loose soil and\r\ndecaying vegetation, in which one sank knee-deep,--the gleam of the\r\nice began to shimmer through the trees; and issuing from the wood,\r\nthe party found themselves in front of a glacier wall, stretching\r\nacross the whole valley and broken into deep rifts, caves, and\r\ncrevasses of dark blue ice. The glacier was actually about a mile\r\nwide; but as the central portion was pressed forward in advance of\r\nthe sides, the whole front was not presented at once. It formed a\r\nsharp crescent, with the curve turned outward. One of the caves in\r\nthis front wall was some thirty or forty feet high, about a hundred\r\nfeet deep, and two or three yards wide at the entrance. At the\r\nfurther end it narrowed to a mere gallery, where the roof was\r\npierced by a circular window, quite symmetrical in shape, through\r\nwhich one looked up to the blue sky and drifting clouds. There must\r\nbe strange effects in this ice-cavern, when the sun is high and\r\nsends a shaft of light through its one window to illuminate the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThis first excursion was a mere reconnaissance. An approximate idea\r\nof the dimensions of the glacier, and some details of its\r\nstructure, were obtained on a second visit the following day. The\r\nanchorage for the night was in Playa Parda Cove, one of the most\r\nbeautiful of the many beautiful harbors of the Magellan Strait. It\r\nis entered by a deep, narrow slit, cut into the mountains on the\r\nnorthern side of the Strait, and widening at its farther end into a\r\nkind of pocket or basin, hemmed in between rocky walls bordered by\r\nforests, and overhung by snow and ice-fields. The next morning at\r\nhalf-past three o'clock, just as moonlight was fading before the\r\ndawn, and the mountains were touched with the coming day, the\r\nreveille was sounded for those who were to return to Glacier Bay.\r\nThis time Agassiz divided his force so that they could act\r\nindependently of each other, though under a general plan laid out\r\nby him. M. de Pourtales and Dr. Steindachner ascended the mountain\r\nto the left of the valley, following its ridge, in the hope of\r\nreaching a position from which they could discover the source and\r\nthe full length of the glacier. In this they did not succeed,\r\nthough M. de Pourtales estimated its length, as far as he could see\r\nfrom any one point, to be about three miles, beyond which it was\r\nlost in the higher range. It made part of a net-work of glaciers\r\nrunning back into a large massif of mountains, and fed by many a\r\nneve on their upper slopes. The depth as well as the length of this\r\nglacier remains somewhat problematical, and indeed all the\r\nestimates in so cursory a survey must be considered as\r\napproximations rather than positive results. The glazed surface of\r\nthe ice is an impediment to any examination from the upper side. It\r\nwould be impossible to spring from brink to brink of a crevasse, as\r\nis so constantly done by explorers of Alpine glaciers where the\r\nedges of the cracks are often snowy or granular. Here the edges of\r\nthe crevasses are sharp and hard, and to spring across one of any\r\nsize would be almost certain death. There is no hold for an Alpine\r\nstock, no grappling point for hands or feet. Any investigation from\r\nthe upper surface would, therefore, require special apparatus, and\r\nmuch more time than Agassiz and his party could give. Neither was\r\nan approach from the side very easy. The glacier arches so much in\r\nthe centre, and slopes away so steeply, that when one is in the\r\nlateral depression between it and the mountain, one faces an almost\r\nperpendicular wall of ice, which blocks the vision completely. M.\r\nde Pourtales measured one of the crevasses in this wall, and found\r\nthat it had a depth of some seventy feet. Judging from the\r\nremarkable convexity of the glacier, it can hardly be less in the\r\ncentre than two or three times its thickness on the edges,\r\n--something over two hundred feet, therefore. Probably none of\r\nthese glaciers of the Strait of Magellan are as thick as those of\r\nSwitzerland, though they are often much broader. The mountains are\r\nnot so high, the valleys not so deep, as in the Alps; the ice is\r\nconsequently not packed into such confined troughs. By some of the\r\nparty an attempt was made to ascertain the rate of movement,\r\nsignals having been adjusted the day before for its measurement.\r\nDuring the middle of the day, it advanced at the rate of ten inches\r\nand a fraction in five hours. One such isolated observation is of\r\ncourse of little comparative value. For himself, Agassiz reserved\r\nthe study of the bay, the ancient bed of the glacier in its former\r\nextension. He spent the day in cruising about the bay in the\r\nsteam-launch, landing at every point he wished to investigate. His\r\nfirst care was to examine minutely the valley walls over which the\r\nglacier must once have moved. Every characteristic feature, known\r\nin the Alps as the work of the glaciers, was not only easily\r\nrecognizable here, but as perfectly preserved as anywhere in\r\nSwitzerland. The rounded knolls to which De Saussure first gave the\r\nname of roches moutonnees were smoothed, polished, scratched, and\r\ngrooved in the direction of the ice movement, the marks running\r\nmostly from south to north, or nearly so. The general trend of the\r\nscratches and furrows showed them to have been continuous from one\r\nknoll to another. The furrows were of various dimensions, sometimes\r\nshallow and several inches broad, sometimes narrow with more\r\ndefined limits, gradually passing into mere lines on a very\r\nsmoothly polished surface. Even the curious notches scooped out of\r\nthe even surfaces, and technically called \"coups de gouge,\" were\r\nnot wanting. In some places the seams of harder rock stood out for\r\na quarter of an inch or so above adjoining decomposed surfaces; in\r\nsuch instances the dike alone retained the glacial marks, which had\r\nbeen worn away from the softer rock.\r\n\r\nThe old moraines were numerous and admirably well preserved.\r\nAgassiz examined with especial care one colossal lateral moraine,\r\nstanding about two miles below the present terminus of the ice and\r\nfive hundred feet above the sea-level. It consisted of the same\r\nrocks as those found on the present terminal moraine, part of them\r\nbeing rounded and worn, while large, angular boulders rested above\r\nthe smaller materials. This moraine forms a dam across a trough in\r\nthe valley wall, and holds back the waters of a beautiful lake,\r\nabout a thousand feet in length and five hundred in width, shutting\r\nit in just as the Lake of Meril in Switzerland is held in its basin\r\nby the glacier of Aletsch. There are erratics some two or three\r\nhundred feet above this great moraine, showing that the glacier\r\nmust have been more than five hundred feet thick when it left this\r\naccumulation of loose materials at such a height. It then united,\r\nhowever, with a large glacier more to the west. Its greatest\r\nthickness, as an independent glacier, is no doubt marked, not by\r\nthe boulders lying higher up, but by the large moraine which shuts\r\nin the lake. The direct connection of this moraine with the glacier\r\nin its former extension is still further shown by two other\r\nmoraines, on lower levels and less perfect, but having the same\r\nrelation to the present terminus of the ice. The lower of these is\r\nonly one hundred and fifty feet above the actual level of the\r\nglacier. These three moraines occur on the western slope of the\r\nbay. The eastern slope is more broken, and while the rounded knolls\r\nare quite as distinct and characteristic, the erratics are more\r\nloosely scattered over the surface. In mineralogical character they\r\nagree with those on the western wall of the bay. Upon the summits\r\nof some small islands at the entrance of the bay, there are also\r\nsome remnants of terminal moraines, formed by the glacier when it\r\nreached the main channel; that is, when it was some three miles\r\nlonger than now.\r\n\r\nThe more recent oscillations, marking the advance and retreat of\r\nthe glacier within certain limits, are shown by the successive\r\nmoraines heaped up in advance of the present terminal wall. The\r\ncentral motion here, as in all the Swiss glaciers, is greater than\r\nthe lateral, the ice being pushed forward in the middle faster than\r\non the sides. But there would seem to be more than one axis of\r\nprogression in this broad mass of ice; for though the centre is\r\npushed out beyond the rest, the terminal wall does not present one\r\nuniform curve, but forms a number of more or less projecting angles\r\nor folds. A few feet in front of this wall is a ridge of loose\r\nmaterials, stones, pebbles, and boulders, repeating exactly the\r\noutline of the ice where it now stands; a few feet in advance of\r\nthis, again, is another ridge precisely like it; still a few feet\r\nbeyond, another; and so on, for four or five concentric zigzag\r\ncrescent-shaped moraines, followed by two others more or less\r\nmarked, till they fade into the larger morainic mass, upon which\r\nstands the belt of wood dividing the present glacier from the bay.\r\nAgassiz counted eight distinct moraines between the glacier and the\r\nbelt of wood, and four concentric moraines in the wood itself. It\r\nis plain that the glacier has ploughed into the forest within some\r\nnot very remote period, for the trees along its margin are loosened\r\nand half uprooted, though not yet altogether decayed. In the\r\npresence of the glacier one ceases to wonder at the effects\r\nproduced by so powerful an agent. This sheet of ice, even in its\r\npresent reduced extent, is about a mile in width, several miles in\r\nlength, and at least two hundred feet in depth. Moving forward as\r\nit does ceaselessly, and armed below with a gigantic file,\r\nconsisting of stones, pebbles, and gravel, firmly set in the ice,\r\nwho can wonder that it should grind, furrow, round, and polish the\r\nsurfaces over which it slowly drags its huge weight. At once\r\ndestroyer and fertilizer, it uproots and blights hundreds of trees\r\nin its progress, yet feeds a forest at its feet with countless\r\nstreams; it grinds the rocks to powder in its merciless mill, and\r\nthen sends them down, a fructifying soil, to the wooded shore\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nAgassiz would gladly have stayed longer in the neighborhood of\r\nGlacier Bay, and have made it the central point of a more detailed\r\nexamination of the glacial phenomena in the Strait. But the\r\nsouthern winter was opening, and already gave signs of its\r\napproach. At dawn on the 26th of March, therefore, the Hassler left\r\nher beautiful anchorage in Playa Parda Cove, six large glaciers\r\nbeing in sight from her deck as she came out. The scenery during\r\nthe morning had a new scientific interest for Agassiz, because the\r\nvessel kept along the northern side of the Strait, while the course\r\nhitherto had been nearer the southern shore. He could thus better\r\ncompare the differences between the two walls of the Strait. The\r\nfact that the northern wall is more evenly worn, more rounded than\r\nthe southern, had a special significance for him, as corresponding\r\nwith like facts in Switzerland, and showing that the ice-sheet had\r\nadvanced across the Strait with greater force in its ascending than\r\nin its descending path. The north side being the strike side, the\r\nice would have pushed against it with greater force. Such a\r\ndifference between the two sides of any hollow or depression in the\r\ndirect path of the ice is well known in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, a pause was made in Chorocua Bay, where Captain\r\nMayne's chart makes mention of a glacier descending into the water.\r\nThere is, indeed, a large glacier on its western side, but so\r\ninaccessible, that any examination of it would have required days\r\nrather than hours. No one, however, regretted the afternoon spent\r\nhere, for the bay was singularly beautiful. On either side, deep\r\ngorges, bordered by richly-wooded cliffs and overhung by ice and\r\nsnow-fields, were cut into the mountains. Where these channels\r\nmight lead, into what dim recesses of ocean and mountain, could\r\nonly be conjectured. The bay, with all its inlets and fiords, was\r\nstill as a church. Voices and laughter seemed an intrusion, and a\r\nlouder shout came back in echoes from far-off hidden retreats. Only\r\nthe swift steamer-ducks, as they shot across, broke the glassy\r\nsurface of the water with their arrow-like wake. From this point\r\nthe Hassler crossed to Sholl Bay, and anchored at the entrance of\r\nSmythe's Channel. As sunset faded over the snow mountains opposite\r\nher anchorage, their white reflection lay like marble in the water.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24.\r\n\r\n1872: AGE 65.\r\n\r\nPicnic in Sholl Bay.\r\nFuegians.\r\nSmythe's Channel.\r\nComparison of Glacial Features with those of the Strait of Magellan.\r\nAncud.\r\nPort of San Pedro.\r\nBay of Concepcion.\r\nThree Weeks in Talcahuana.\r\nCollections.\r\nGeology.\r\nLand Journey to Santiago.\r\nScenes along the Road.\r\nReport on Glacial Features to Mr. Peirce.\r\nArrival at Santiago.\r\nElection as Foreign Associate of the Institute of France.\r\nValparaiso.\r\nThe Galapagos.\r\nGeological and Zoological Features.\r\nArrival at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe next day forces were divided. The vessel put out into the\r\nStrait again for sounding and dredging, while Agassiz, with a\r\nsmaller party, landed in Sholl Bay. Here, after having made a fire\r\nand pitched a tent in which to deposit wraps, provisions etc., the\r\ncompany dispersed in various directions along the shore,\r\ngeologizing, botanizing, and collecting. Agassiz was especially\r\nengaged in studying the structure of the beach itself. He found\r\nthat the ridge of the beach was formed by a glacial moraine, while\r\naccumulations of boulders, banked up in morainic ridges, concentric\r\nwith one another and with the beach moraine, extended far out from\r\nthe shore like partly sunken reefs. The pebbles and boulders of\r\nthese ridges were not local, or, at least, only partially so; they\r\nhad the same geological character as those of the drift material\r\nthroughout the Strait.\r\n\r\nThe day was favorable for work, and there was little to remind one\r\nof approaching winter. A creek of fresh water, that ran out upon\r\none part of the beach, led up to a romantic brook, rushing down\r\nthrough a gorge bordered by moss-grown trees and carpeted by ferns\r\nand lichens in all its nooks and corners. This brook took its rise\r\nin a small lake lying some half a mile behind the beach. The\r\ncollections made along the shore in this excursion were large and\r\nvarious: star-fish, volutas, sea-urchins, sea-anemones, medusae,\r\ndoris; many small fishes, also, from the tide-pools, beside a\r\nnumber drawn in the seine.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, when the party had assembled around the beach\r\nfire for rest and refreshment, before returning to the vessel,\r\ntheir lunch was interrupted by strange and unexpected guests. A\r\nboat rounded the point of the beach, and, as it came nearer, proved\r\nto be full of Fuegian natives, men, women, children, and dogs,\r\ntheir invariable companions. The men alone landed, some six or\r\nseven in number, and came toward the tent. Nothing could be more\r\ncoarse and repulsive than their appearance, in which the brutality\r\nof the savage was in no way redeemed by physical strength or\r\nmanliness. They were almost naked, for the short, loose skins tied\r\naround the neck, and hanging from the shoulders, over the back,\r\npartly to the waist, could hardly be called clothing. With swollen\r\nbodies, thin limbs, and stooping forms; with a childish, yet\r\ncunning, leer on their faces, they crouched over the fire,\r\nspreading their hands toward its genial warmth, and all shrieking\r\nat once, \"Tabac! tabac!\" and \"Galleta!\"--biscuit. Tobacco there was\r\nnone; but the remains of the lunch, such as it was,--hard bread and\r\npork,--was distributed among them, and they greedily devoured it.\r\nThen the one who, judging from a certain deference paid him by the\r\nothers, might be the chief, or leader, seated himself on a stone\r\nand sang in a singular kind of monotonous, chanting tone. The\r\nwords, as interpreted by the gestures and expressions, seemed to be\r\nan improvisation concerning the strangers they had found upon the\r\nbeach, and were evidently addressed to them. There was something\r\ncurious in the character of this Fuegian song. Rather recitative\r\nthan singing, the measure had, nevertheless, certain divisions or\r\npauses, as if to mark a kind of rhythm. It was brought to a close\r\nat regularly recurring intervals, and ended always in the same way,\r\nand on the same note, with a rising inflection of the voice. When\r\nthe song was finished, a certain surprise and expectancy in the\r\nlisteners kept them silent. This seemed to trouble the singer, who\r\nlooked round with a comical air of inquiring disappointment. Thus\r\nreminded, the audience were quick to applaud, and then he laughed\r\nwith pleasure, imitated the clapping of the hands in an awkward\r\nway, and nothing loth, began to sing again.\r\n\r\nThe recall gun from the Hassler brought this strange scene to a\r\nclose, and the party hastened down to the beach, closely followed\r\nby their guests, who still clamorously demanded tobacco. Meanwhile\r\nthe women had brought the boat close to that of the Hassler at the\r\nlanding. They all began to laugh, talk, and gesticulate, and seemed\r\na noisy grew, chattering unceasingly, with amazing rapidity, and\r\nall together. Their boat, with the babies and dogs to add to the\r\ntumult, was a perfect babel of voices. They put off at once,\r\nkeeping as close as they could to the Hassler boat, and reaching\r\nthe vessel almost at the same time. They were not allowed to come\r\non board, but tobacco and biscuit, as well as bright calico and\r\nbeads for the women, were thrown down to them. They scrambled and\r\nsnatched fiercely, like wild animals, for whatever they could\r\ncatch. They had some idea of barter, for when they found they had\r\nreceived all that they were likely to get gratuitously, they held\r\nup bows and arrows, wicker baskets, birds, and the large\r\nsea-urchins, which are an article of food with them. Even after the\r\nsteamer had started, they still clung to the side, praying,\r\nshrieking, screaming, for more \"tabac.\" When they found it a\r\nhopeless chase, they dropped off, and began again the same chanting\r\nrecitative, waving their hands in farewell.\r\n\r\nAlways interested in the comparative study of the races, Agassiz\r\nregretted that he had no other opportunity of observing the natives\r\nof this region and comparing them with the Indians he had seen\r\nelsewhere, in Brazil and in the United States. It is true that he\r\nand his companions, when on shore, frequently came upon their\r\ndeserted camps, or single empty huts; and their canoes followed the\r\nHassler several times, but never when it was convenient to stop and\r\nlet them come up with the vessel. This particular set were not in a\r\ncanoe, but in a large boat of English build. Probably they had\r\nstolen it, or had found it, perhaps, stranded on the shore. They\r\nare usually, however, in canoes of their own making. One can only\r\nwonder that people ingenious enough to construct canoes so well\r\nmodeled and so neatly and strongly put together, should have\r\ninvented nothing better in the way of a house than a hut built of\r\nflexible branches, compared with which a wigwam is an elaborate\r\ndwelling. These huts are hood-like in shape, and too low for any\r\nposture but that of squatting or lying down. In front is always a\r\nscorched spot on the ground, where their handful of fire has\r\nsmouldered; and at one side, a large heap of empty shells, showing\r\nthat they had occupied this place until they had exhausted the\r\nsupply of mussels, on which they chiefly live. When this is the\r\ncase, they move to some other spot, gather a few branches,\r\nreconstruct their frail shelter, and continue the same life.\r\nUntaught by their necessities, they wander thus, naked and\r\nhomeless, in snow, mist, and rain, as they have done for ages,\r\nasking of the land only a strip of beach and a handful of fire; and\r\nof the ocean, shell-fish enough to save them from starvation.\r\n\r\nThe Hassler had now fairly entered upon Smythe's Channel, and was\r\nanchored at evening (March 27th) in Otway Bay, a lake-like harbor,\r\nbroken by islands. Mount Burney, a noble, snow-covered mountain,\r\ncorresponding to Mount Sarmiento in grandeur of outline, was in\r\nfull view, but was partially veiled in mist. On the following day,\r\nhowever, the weather was perfect for the sail past Sarmiento Range\r\nand Snowy Glacier, which were in sight all day. Blue could not be\r\nmore deep and pure, nor white more spotless, than their ice and\r\nsnow-fields. Toward the latter part of the day, an immense expanse\r\nof snow opened out a little beyond Snowy Range. It was covered with\r\nthe most curious snow hummocks, forming high cones over the whole\r\nsurface, their shadows slanting over the glittering snow in the\r\nafternoon sunshine. They were most fantastic in shape, and some\r\nfifty or sixty in number. At first sight, they resembled heaped-up\r\nmounds or pyramids of snow; but as the vessel approached, one group\r\nof them, so combined as to simulate a fortification, showed a face\r\nof rock where the snow had been blown away, and it seemed therefore\r\nprobable that all were alike,--snow-covered pinnacles of rock.\r\n\r\nThe evening anchorage on the 28th was in Mayne's Harbor, a pretty\r\ninlet of Owen's Island. Here the vessel was detained for\r\ntwenty-four hours by the breaking of the reversing rod. The\r\nengineers repaired it to the best of their ability, with such\r\napparatus as they had, but it was a source of anxiety till a port\r\nwas reached where a new one could be supplied. The detention, had\r\nit not been for such a cause, was welcome to the scientific party.\r\nAgassiz found the rounded and moutonnees surfaces and the general\r\nmodeling of the outlines of ice no less marked here than in the\r\nStrait; and in a ramble over the hills above the anchorage, M. de\r\nPourtales came upon very distinct glacial scorings and furrows on\r\ndikes and ledges of greenstone and syenite. They were perfectly\r\nregular, and could be connected by their trend from ledge to ledge,\r\nacross intervening spaces of softer decomposed rock, from which all\r\nsuch surface markings had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe country above Mayne's Harbor was pretty, though somewhat\r\nbarren. Beyond the narrow belt of woods bordering the shore, the\r\nwalking was over soggy hummocks, with little growth upon them\r\nexcept moss, lichens, and coarse marsh grass. These were succeeded\r\nby ridges of crumbling rock, between which were numerous small\r\nlakes. The land seemed very barren of life. Even the shores of the\r\nponds were hardly inhabited. No song of bird or buzz of insect\r\nbroke the stillness. Rock after rock was turned over in the vain\r\nexpectation of finding living things on the damp under side at\r\nleast; and the cushions of moss were broken up in the same\r\nfruitless chase. All was barren and lifeless. Not so on the shore,\r\nwhere the collecting went on rapidly. Dredge and nets were at work\r\nall the morning, and abundant collections were made also from the\r\nlittle nooks and inlets of the beach. Agassiz found two new\r\njelly-fishes, and christened them at once as the locality\r\nsuggested, one for Captain Mayne, the other for Professor Owen.\r\nNear the shore, birds also seemed more abundant. A pair of\r\nkelp-geese and a steamer duck were brought in, and one of the\r\nofficers reported humming-birds flitting across the brook from\r\nwhich the Hassler's tanks were filled.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 30th, while mountains and snow-fields,\r\nwoodland and water, still lay between moonlight and sunrise, the\r\nHassler started for Tarn Bay. It was a beautiful Easter Sunday,\r\nwith very little wind, and a soft sky, broken by few clouds. But\r\nsuch beginnings are too apt to be delusive in this region of wet\r\nand fog, and a heavy rain, with thick mist, came up in the\r\nafternoon. That night, for the first time, the Hassler missed her\r\nanchorage, and lay off the shore near an island, which afforded\r\nsome protection from the wind. A forlorn hope was detailed to the\r\nshore, where a large fire was kept burning all night, that the\r\nvessel might not lose her bearings and drift away. In the morning\r\nall was right again, and she kept on her course to Rowlet Narrows.\r\n\r\nThis passage is formed by a deep gorge, cleft between lofty walls\r\nover which many a waterfall foams from reservoirs of snow above.\r\nAgassiz observed two old glacier beds on the western side of the\r\npass--two shallow depressions, lying arid and scored between\r\nswelling wooded ridges. He had not met in all the journey a better\r\nlocality for the study of glacial effects than here. The sides of\r\nthe channel show these traces throughout their whole length. In\r\nthis same neighborhood, as a conspicuous foreground on the shore of\r\nIndian Reach, to the south of Lackawanna Cove, is a large moraine\r\nresembling the \"horse-backs,\" in the State of Maine, New England.\r\nThe top was as level as a railroad embankment. The anchorage for\r\nthe night was in Eden Harbor, and for that evening, at least, it\r\nwas lovely enough to deserve its name. The whole expanse of its\r\nland-locked waters, held between mountains and broken by islands,\r\nwas rosy and purple in the setting sun. The gates of the garden\r\nwere closed, however, not by a flaming sword, but by an\r\nimpenetrable forest, along the edge of which a scanty rim of beach\r\nhardly afforded landing or foothold. The collections here,\r\ntherefore, were small; but a good haul was made with the trawl net,\r\nwhich gathered half-a-dozen species of echinoderms, some small\r\nfishes, and a number of shells. Fog detained the vessel in Eden\r\nHarbor till a late hour in the morning, but the afternoon was\r\nfavorable for the passage through the English Narrows, the most\r\ncontracted part of Smythe's Channel. It is, indeed, a mere mountain\r\ndefile, through which the water rushes with such force that, in\r\nnavigating it, great care was required to keep the vessel off the\r\nrocks. Her anchorage at the close of the day was in Connor's Cove,\r\na miniature harbor not unlike Borja Bay in the Strait. It was a\r\ntranquil retreat. The water-birds seemed to find it so, for the\r\nsteamer ducks were trailing their long wakes through the water, and\r\na large kind of stormy petrel sailed up to the vessel, and almost\r\nput himself into the hands of the sailors, with whom he remained an\r\nunresisting prisoner.\r\n\r\nGeologically, Agassiz found Connor's Cove of especial interest. It\r\nruns east and west, opening on the eastern side of the channel; but\r\nthe knolls, that is to say, the rounded surfaces at its entrance,\r\nare furrowed across the cove, at right angles with it. In other\r\nwords, the movement of the ice, always from south to north, has\r\nbeen with Smythe's Channel, and across the Strait of Magellan.\r\nIndeed it seemed to Agassiz that all the glacial agency in Smythe's\r\nChannel, the trend of the furrows, the worn surfaces whereon they\r\nwere to be found, and the steepness of southern exposures as\r\ncompared with the more rounded opposite slopes, pointed to the same\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the third of April Agassiz left with regret this region of ocean\r\nand mountain, glacier, snow-field, and forest. The weeks he had\r\nspent there were all too short for the work he had hoped to do.\r\nYet, trained as he was in glacial phenomena, even so cursory an\r\nobservation satisfied him that in the southern, as in the northern\r\nhemisphere, the present glaciers are but a remnant of the ancient\r\nice-period.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of open sea and head winds, the next anchorage was\r\nin Port San Pedro, a very beautiful bay opening on the north side\r\nof Corcovado Gulf, with snow mountains in full sight; the Peak of\r\nCorcovado and a wonderfully symmetrical volcanic mountain,\r\nMelimoya, white as purest marble to the summit, were clearly\r\ndefined against the sky. Forests clothed the shore on every side,\r\nand the shelving beach met the wood in a bank of wild Bromelia,\r\nmost brilliant in color. Not only were excellent collections made\r\non this beach, but the shore was strewn with large accumulations of\r\nerratics. Among them was a green epidotic rock which Agassiz had\r\ntraced to this spot from the Bay of San Antonio on the Patagonian\r\ncoast, without ever finding it in place. Some of the larger\r\nboulders had glacial furrows and scratches upon them, and all the\r\nhills bordering the shore were rounded and moutonnee. One of the\r\ngreat charms for Agassiz in the scenery of all this region, and\r\nespecially in the Strait of Magellan, was a kind of home feeling\r\nthat it gave him. Although the mountains rose from the ocean,\r\ninstead of from the plain as in Switzerland, yet the snow-fields\r\nand the glaciers carried him back to his youth. To him, the sunset\r\nof this evening in the Port San Pedro, with the singular\r\ntransparent rose color over the snow mountains, and the soft\r\nsucceeding pallor, was the very reproduction of an Alpine sunset.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought a disappointment. From this point Agassiz\r\nhad hoped to continue the voyage by the inside passage between the\r\nmain-land and the island of Chiloe. This was of importance to him,\r\non account of its geological relation to Smythe's Channel and the\r\nStrait of Magellan. In the absence of any good charts of the\r\nchannel, the Captain, after examining the shoals at the entrance,\r\nwas forced to decide, almost as much to his own regret as to that\r\nof Agassiz, not to attempt the further passage. Keeping up the\r\nouter coast of Chiloe, therefore, the vessel anchored before Ancud\r\non the 8th of April. It was a heavenly day. The volcanic peak of\r\nOsorno and the whole snowy Cordilleras were unveiled. The little\r\ntown above the harbor, with its outlying farms on the green and\r\nfertile hills around, seemed like the very centre of civilization\r\nto people who had been so long out of the world. It is said to rain\r\nin Ancud three hundred and sixty-five days in the year. But on this\r\nparticular afternoon it was a very sunny place, and the inhabitants\r\nseemed to avail themselves of their rare privilege. Groups of\r\nIndians, who had come across the river in the morning to sell their\r\nmilk in the town, were resting in picturesque groups around their\r\nempty milk-cans, the women wrapped in their long shawls, the men in\r\ntheir ponchos and slouched hats; the country people were driving\r\nout their double teams of strong, powerful oxen harnessed to wooden\r\ntroughs filled with manure for the fields; the washerwomen were\r\nscrubbing and beating their linen along the roadside; the gardens\r\nof the poorest houses were bright with large shrubs of wild\r\nfuchsia, and, altogether, the aspect of the little place was\r\ncheerful and pretty. Agassiz had but two or three hours for a look\r\nat the geology. Even this cursory glance sufficed to show him that\r\nthe drift materials, even to their special mineralogical elements,\r\nwere the same as in the Magellan Strait. Here they rested, however,\r\non volcanic soil.\r\n\r\nStopping at Lota for coal, but not long enough for any scientific\r\nwork, the Hassler entered Concepcion Bay on the 15th April, and\r\nanchored near Talcahuana, where she was to remain some three weeks\r\nfor the repair of her engine. This quaint, primitive little town is\r\nbuilt upon one of the finest harbors on the Pacific coast. Agassiz\r\nwas fortunate in finding, through the kindness of Captain Johnson,\r\na partially furnished house, where several large vacant rooms,\r\nopening on the \"patio,\" served admirably as scientific\r\nlaboratories. Here, then, he established himself with his\r\nassistants. It was soon understood that every living thing would\r\nfind a market with him, and all the idle urchins about the town\r\nflocked to the house with specimens. An unceasing traffic of birds,\r\nshells, fish, etc., went on there from morning to night, and to the\r\nvarious vendors were added groups of Indians coming to have their\r\nphotographs taken. There were charming excursions and walks in the\r\nneighborhood, and the geology of the region was so interesting that\r\nit determined Agassiz to go by land from Talcahuana to Valparaiso,\r\non a search after any glacial tracks that might be found in the\r\nvalley lying between the Cordillera of the Andes and the Coast\r\nRange. Meanwhile the Hassler was to go on a dredging expedition to\r\nthe island of Juan Fernandez, and then proceed to Valparaiso, where\r\nAgassiz was to join her a fortnight later. Although this expedition\r\nwas under the patronage of the Coast Survey, the generosity of Mr.\r\nThayer, so constantly extended to scientific aims, had followed\r\nAgassiz on this second journey. To his kindness he owed the\r\npossibility of organizing an excursion apart from the direct object\r\nof the voyage. This change of plan and its cause is told in the\r\nfollowing extract from his general report to Professor Peirce:--\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27th.\r\n\r\nWhile I was transcribing my Report, Pourtales came in with the\r\nstatement that he had noticed the first indication of an Andean\r\nglacier in the vicinity. I have visited the locality twice since.\r\nIt is a magnificent polished surface, as well preserved as any I\r\nhave ever seen upon old glaciated ground or under glaciers of the\r\npresent day, with well-marked furrows and scratches. Think of it! a\r\ncharacteristic surface, indicating glacier action, in latitude 37\r\ndegrees south, at the level of the sea! The place is only a few\r\nfeet above tide level, upon the slope of a hill on which stand the\r\nruins of a Spanish fort, near the fishermen's huts of San Vicente,\r\nwhich lies between Concepcion Bay and the Bay of Aranco. Whether\r\nthe polished surface is the work of a glacier descending from the\r\nAndes to the sea-shore or not, I have not yet been able to\r\ndetermine. I find no volcanic pebbles or boulders in this vicinity,\r\nwhich, after my experience in San Carlos, I should expect all along\r\nthe shore, if the glaciers of the Andes had descended to the level\r\nof the ocean, in this part of the country. The erratics here have\r\nthe character of those observed farther south. It is true the\r\nfurrows and scratches of this polished surface run mainly from east\r\nto west; but there are some crossing the main trend, at angles\r\nranging from 20 to 30 degrees, and running south-east-north-west.\r\nMoreover, the magnetic variation is 18 degrees 3 degrees at\r\nTalcahuano April 23rd, the true meridian bearing to the right of\r\nthe magnetic. I shall soon know what to make of this, as I start\r\nto-morrow for the interior, to go to Santiago and join the ship\r\nagain at Valparaiso. I have hired a private carriage, to be able\r\nto stop whenever I wish so to do. I also take a small seine to fish\r\nfor fresh water fishes in the many streams intervening between this\r\nplace and Valparaiso. The trend of the glacial scratches in San\r\nVicente reminds me of a fact I have often observed in New England\r\nnear the sea-shore, where the glacial furrows dip to a considerable\r\nextent eastward toward the deep ocean, while further inland their\r\ntrend is more regular and due North and South. . .\r\n\r\n\"I had almost forgotten to say that I have obtained unquestionable\r\nevidence of the cretaceous age of the coal deposits of Lota and the\r\nadjoining localities, north and south, which are generally supposed\r\nto be tertiary lignites. They are overlaid by sandstone containing\r\nBaculites! I need not adduce other evidence to satisfy geologists\r\nof the correctness of my assertion. I have myself collected a great\r\nmany of these fossils, in beds resting upon coal-seams. Ever truly\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April, then, Agassiz left Talcahuana, accompanied by\r\nMrs. Agassiz, and by Dr. Steindachner, who was to assist him in\r\nmaking collections along the way. They were to travel post, along\r\nthe diligence road, until they reached Curicu, within half a day of\r\nSantiago, where railroad travel began. It was a beautiful journey,\r\nand though the rainy season was impending, the fair weather was\r\nuninterrupted. The way lay for the most part through an\r\nagricultural district of corn, wheat, and vineyards. In this\r\nstrange land, where seasons are reversed, and autumn has changed\r\nplaces with spring, the work of harvest and vintage was just going\r\non. The road was full of picturesque scenes: troops of mules might\r\nbe met, a hundred at a time, laden with corn-sacks; the queer,\r\nprimitive carts of the country creaked along, carrying huge\r\nwine-jars filled with the fresh new juice of the grape; the road\r\nwas gay with country people in their holiday dresses; the women,\r\nwho wore their bright shawls like a kind of mantle, were sometimes\r\non foot and sometimes pillioned behind the men, who were invariably\r\non horseback, and whose brilliant ponchos and fine riding added to\r\nthe impression of life and color. Rivers and streams were frequent;\r\nand as there were no bridges, the scenes at the fords, sometimes\r\ncrossed on rafts, sometimes on flat boats, worked by ropes, were\r\nexciting and picturesque. For rustic interiors along the road side,\r\nthere were the huts of the working people, rough trellises of\r\ntree-trunks interwoven with branches; green as arbors while fresh,\r\na coarse thatch when dry. There was always a large open space in\r\nfront, sheltered by the projecting thatch of the house, and\r\nfurnished sometimes with a rough table and benches. Here would be\r\nthe women at their work, or the children at play, or sometimes the\r\ndrovers taking their lunch of tortillas and wine, while their\r\nanimals munched their midday meal hard by. The scenery was often\r\nfine. On the third day the fertile soil, watered by many rivers,\r\nwas exchanged for a sandy plain, broken by a thorny mimosa\r\nscattered over the surface. This plain lay between the Cordillera\r\nof the Andes and the Coast Range. As the road advanced farther\r\ninland, the panorama of the Cordilleras became more and more\r\nstriking. In the glow of the sunset, the peaks of the abrupt,\r\njagged walls and the volcano-like summits were defined against the\r\nsky in all their rugged beauty. There was little here to remind one\r\nof the loveliness of the Swiss Alps. With no lower green slopes, no\r\nsoft pasturage grounds leading gently up to rocky heights, the\r\nAndes, at least in this part of their range, rise arid, stern, and\r\nbold from base to crest, a fortress wall unbroken by tree or shrub,\r\nor verdure of any kind, and relieved only by the rich and varied\r\ncoloring of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe lodgings for the night were found in small towns along the\r\nroad, Tome, Chilian, Linarez, Talca, Curicu, and once, when there\r\nwas no inn within reach, at a hospitable hacienda.\r\n\r\nA brief sketch of the geological observations made on this\r\nexcursion is found in a letter from Agassiz to Mr. Peirce. He never\r\nwrote out, as he had intended to do, a more detailed report.\r\n\r\nOFF GUATEMALA, July 29, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PEIRCE,\r\n\r\n. . .I have another new chapter concerning glacial phenomena,\r\ngathered during our land-journey from Talcahuana to Santiago. It is\r\nso complicated a story that I do not feel equal now to recording\r\nthe details in a connected statement, but will try to give you the\r\nmain facts in a few words.\r\n\r\nThere is a broad valley between the Andes and the Coast Range, the\r\nvalley of Chilian, extending from the Gulf of Ancud, or Port de\r\nMott, to Santiago and farther north. This valley is a continuation,\r\nupon somewhat higher level, of the channels which, from the Strait\r\nof Magellan to Chiloe, separate the islands from the main-land,\r\nwith the sole interruption of Tres Montes. Now this great valley,\r\nextending for more than twenty-five degrees of latitude, is a\r\nCONTINUOUS GLACIER BOTTOM, showing plainly that for its whole\r\nlength the great southern ice-sheet has been retreating southward\r\nin it. I could find nowhere any indication that glaciers descending\r\nfrom the Andes had crossed this valley and reached the shores of\r\nthe Pacific. In a few brief localities only did I notice Andean, i.\r\ne. volcanic, erratics upon the loose materials filling the old\r\nglacier bottom. Between Curicu and Santiago, however, facing the\r\ngorge of Tenon, I saw two distinct lateral moraines, parallel to\r\none another, chiefly composed of volcanic boulders, resting upon\r\nthe old drift, and indicating by their position the course of a\r\nlarge glacier that once poured down from the Andes of Tenon, and\r\ncrossed the main valley, without, however, extending beyond the\r\neastern slope of the Coast Range. These moraines are so well marked\r\nthat they are known throughout the country as the cerillos of\r\nTenon, but nobody suspects their glacial origin; even the\r\ngeologists of Santiago assign a volcanic origin to them. What is\r\ndifficult to describe in this history are the successive retrograde\r\nsteps of the great southern ice-field that, step by step, left\r\nlarger or smaller tracts of the valley to the north of it free of\r\nice, so that large glacial lakes could be formed, and seem, indeed,\r\nalways to have existed along the retreating edge of the great\r\nsouthern glacier. The natural consequence is that there are\r\neverywhere stratified terraces without border barriers (since these\r\nwere formed only by the ice that has vanished), resting at\r\nsuccessively higher or lower levels, as you move north or south,\r\nupon unstratified drift of older date; the northernmost of these\r\nterraces being the oldest, while those further south belong to later\r\nsteps in the waning of the ice-fields. From these data I infer that\r\nmy suggestion concerning the trend of the strike upon the polished\r\nand glaciated surface of the vicinity of Talcahuana, alluded to in\r\nthe postscript of my last letter, is probably correct. . .\r\n\r\nAt Santiago Agassiz rested a day or two. Here, as everywhere\r\nthroughout the country, he met with the greatest kindness and\r\ncordiality. A public reception and dinner were urged upon him by\r\nthe city, but his health obliged him to decline this and like\r\nhonors elsewhere. Among the letters awaiting him here, was one\r\nwhich brought him a pleasant surprise. It announced his election as\r\nForeign Associate of the Institute of France,--\"one of the eight.\"\r\nAs the crowning honor of his scientific career, this was, of\r\ncourse, very gratifying to him. In writing soon after to the\r\nEmperor of Brazil, who had expressed a warm interest in his\r\nelection, he says: \"The distinction pleased me the more because so\r\nunexpected. Unhappily it is usually a brevet of infirmity, or at\r\nleast of old age, and in my case it is to a house in ruins that the\r\ndiploma is addressed. I regret it the more because I have never\r\nfelt more disposed for work, and yet never so fatigued by it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Santiago Agassiz proceeded to Valparaiso, where he rejoined\r\nthe ship's company. The events of their cruise had been less\r\nsatisfactory than those of his land-journey, for, owing to the\r\nrottenness of the ropes, produced by dampness, the hauls of the\r\ndredge from the greatest depths had been lost. Several pauses for\r\ndredging in shallower waters were made with good success,\r\nnevertheless, on the way up the coast to Callao. From there the\r\nHassler put out to sea once more, for the Galapagos, arriving\r\nbefore Charles Island on the 10th of June, and visiting in\r\nsuccession Albemarle, James, Jarvis, and Indefatigable islands.\r\n\r\nAgassiz enjoyed extremely his cruise among these islands of such\r\nrare geological and zoological interest. Purely volcanic in\r\ncharacter, and of very recent formation, they yet support a fauna\r\nand flora quite their own, very peculiar and characteristic.\r\nAlbemarle Island was, perhaps, the most interesting of all. It is a\r\nbarren mountain rising from the sea, its base and slope covered\r\nwith small extinct craters. No less than fifty--some perfectly\r\nsymmetrical, others irregular, as if blasted out on one side--could\r\nbe counted from the deck as the vessel neared the shore. Indeed,\r\nthe whole island seemed like some subterranean furnace, of which\r\nthese craters were the chimneys. The anchorage was in Tagus Sound,\r\na deep, quiet bay, less peaceful once, for its steep sides are\r\nformed by the walls of an old crater.\r\n\r\nThe next day, June 15, was spent by the whole scientific party in a\r\nramble on shore. The landing was at the foot of a ravine. Climbing\r\nits left bank, they were led by a short walk to the edge of a large\r\ncrater, which held a beautiful lake in its cup. It was, in fact, a\r\ncrater within a crater, for a second one, equally symmetrical, rose\r\noutside and above it. Following the brink of this lake to its upper\r\nend, they struck across to the head of the ravine. It terminated in\r\na ridge, which looked down upon an immense field or sea of hardened\r\nlava, spreading over an area of several miles till it reached the\r\nocean. This ancient bed of lava was full of the most singular and\r\nfantastic details of lava structure. It was a field of charred\r\nruins, among which were more or less open caves or galleries, some\r\nlarge enough to hold a number of persons standing upright, others\r\nhardly allowing room to creep through on hands and knees. Rounded\r\ndomes were common, sometimes broken, sometimes whole; now and then\r\nsome great lava bubble was pierced with a window blasted out of the\r\nside, through which one could look down to the floor of a deep,\r\nunderground hollow.\r\n\r\nThe whole company, some six or eight persons, lunched in one of the\r\ncaves, resting on the seats formed by the ledges of lava along its\r\nsides. It had an entrance at either end, was some forty feet long,\r\nat least ten feet high in the centre, and perhaps six or eight feet\r\nwide. Probably never before had it served as a banqueting hall.\r\nSuch a hollow tunnel or arch had been formed wherever the interior\r\nof a large mass of lava, once cooled, had become heated again, and\r\nhad flowed out, leaving the outside crust standing. The whole story\r\nof this lava bed is so clearly told in its blackened and extinct\r\nremains, that it needs no stretch of the imagination to recreate\r\nthe scene. It is again, a heaving, palpitating sheet of fire; the\r\ndead slags are aglow, and the burned-out furnaces cast up their\r\nmolten, blazing contents, as of old. Now it is the home of the\r\nlarge red and orange-colored iguanas, of which a number were\r\ncaptured, both alive and dead. These islands proved, indeed,\r\nadmirable collecting grounds, the more interesting from the\r\npeculiarity of their local fauna.\r\n\r\nFROM AGASSIZ TO PROFESSOR PEIRCE.\r\n\r\nOFF GUATEMALA, July 29.\r\n\r\n. . .Our visit to the Galapagos has been full of geological and\r\nzoological interest. It is most impressive to see an extensive\r\narchipelago, of MOST RECENT ORIGIN, inhabited by creatures so\r\ndifferent from any known in other parts of the world. Here we have\r\na positive limit to the length of time that may have been granted\r\nfor the transformation of these animals, if indeed they are in any\r\nway derived from others dwelling in different parts of the world.\r\nThe Galapagos are so recent that some of the islands are barely\r\ncovered with the most scanty vegetation, itself peculiar to these\r\nislands. Some parts of their surface are entirely bare, and a great\r\nmany of the craters and lava streams are so fresh, that the\r\natmospheric agents have not yet made an impression on them. Their\r\nage does not, therefore, go back to earlier geological periods;\r\nthey belong to our times, geologically speaking. Whence, then, do\r\ntheir inhabitants (animals as well as plants) come? If descended\r\nfrom some other type, belonging to any neighboring land, then it\r\ndoes not require such unspeakably long periods for the\r\ntransformation of species as the modern advocates of transmutation\r\nclaim; and the mystery of change, with such marked and\r\ncharacteristic differences between existing species, is only\r\nincreased, and brought to a level with that of creation. If they\r\nare autochthones, from what germs did they start into existence? I\r\nthink that careful observers, in view of these facts, will have to\r\nacknowledge that our science is not yet ripe for a fair discussion\r\nof the origin of organized beings. . .\r\n\r\nThere is little to tell for the rest of the voyage that cannot be\r\ncondensed into a few words. There was a detention for despatches\r\nand for Coast Survey business at Panama,--a delay which was turned\r\nto good account in collecting, both in the Bay and on the Isthmus.\r\nAt San Diego, also, admirable collections were made, and pleasant\r\ndays were spent. This was the last station on the voyage of the\r\nHassler. She reached her destination and entered the Golden Gate on\r\nthe 24th of August, 1872. Agassiz was touched by his reception in\r\nSan Francisco. Attentions and kindnesses were showered upon him\r\nfrom all sides, but his health allowed him to accept only such\r\nhospitalities as were of the most quiet and private nature. He\r\npassed a month in San Francisco, but was unable to undertake any of\r\nthe well-known excursions to the Yosemite Valley or the great\r\ntrees. Rest and home became every day more imperative necessities.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25.\r\n\r\n1872-1873: AGE 65-66.\r\n\r\nReturn to Cambridge.\r\nSummer School proposed.\r\nInterest of Agassiz.\r\nGift of Mr. Anderson.\r\nProspectus of Penikese School.\r\nDifficulties.\r\nOpening of School.\r\nSummer Work.\r\nClose of School.\r\nLast Course of Lectures at Museum.\r\nLecture before Board of Agriculture.\r\nIllness.\r\nDeath.\r\nPlace of Burial.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1872, Agassiz returned to Cambridge. To arrange the\r\ncollections he had brought back, to write a report of his journey\r\nand its results, to pass the next summer quietly at his Nahant\r\nlaboratory, continuing his work on the Sharks and Skates, for which\r\nhe had brought home new and valuable material, seemed the natural\r\nsequence of his year of travel. But he found a new scheme of\r\neducation on foot; one for which he had himself given the first\r\nimpulse, but which some of his younger friends had carefully\r\nconsidered and discussed in his absence, being confident that with\r\nhis help it might be accomplished. The plan was to establish a\r\nsummer school of natural history somewhere on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts, where teachers from our schools and colleges could\r\nmake their vacations serviceable, both for work and recreation, by\r\nthe direct study of nature. No sooner was Agassiz once more at home\r\nthan he was confronted by this scheme, and he took it up with\r\ncharacteristic ardor. Means there were none, nor apparatus, nor\r\nbuilding, nor even a site for one. There was only the ideal, and to\r\nthat he brought the undying fervor of his intellectual faith. The\r\nprospectus was soon sketched, and, once before the public, it\r\nawakened a strong interest. In March, when the Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts made their annual visit to the Museum of Comparative\r\nzoology, Agassiz laid this new project before them as one of deep\r\ninterest for science in general, and especially for schools and\r\ncolleges throughout the land. He considered it also an educational\r\nbranch of the Museum, having, as such, a claim on their sympathy,\r\nsince it was in the line of the direct growth and continuance of\r\nthe same work. Never did he plead more eloquently for the cause of\r\neducation. His gift as a speaker cannot easily be described. It was\r\nborn of conviction, and was as simple as it was impassioned. It\r\nkept the freshness of youth, because the things of which he spoke\r\nnever grew old to him, but moved him to the last hour of his life\r\nas forcibly as in his earlier years.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Legislature, spoken in the morning, chanced to\r\nbe read in the evening papers of the same day by Mr. John Anderson,\r\na rich merchant of New York. It at once enlisted his sympathy both\r\nfor the work and for the man. Within the week he offered to\r\nAgassiz, as a site for the school, the island of Penikese, in\r\nBuzzard's Bay, with the buildings upon it, consisting of a\r\nfurnished dwelling-house and barn. Scarcely was this gift accepted\r\nthan he added to it an endowment of 50,000 dollars for the\r\nequipment of the school. Adjectives belittle deeds like these. The\r\nbare statement says more than the most laudatory epithets.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was no less surprised than touched at the aid thus\r\nunexpectedly offered. In his letter of acknowledgment he says: \"You\r\ndo not know what it is suddenly and unexpectedly to find a friend\r\nat your side, full of sympathy, and offering support to a scheme\r\nwhich you have been trying to carry out under difficulties and with\r\nvery scanty means. I feel grateful to you for making the road so\r\neasy, and I believe you will have the permanent gratitude of\r\nscientific men here and elsewhere, for I have the utmost confidence\r\nthat this summer school will give valuable opportunities for\r\noriginal research, as well as for instruction.\" At Agassiz's\r\nsuggestion the school was to bear the name of \"The Anderson School\r\nof Natural History.\" Mr. Anderson wished to substitute the name of\r\nAgassiz for his own. This Agassiz absolutely refused to permit,\r\nsaying that he was but one of many scientific men who had already\r\noffered their services to the school for the coming summer, some of\r\nwhom would, no doubt, continue to work for it in the future, and\r\nall of whom would be equally indebted to Mr. Anderson. It was,\r\ntherefore, most suitable that it should bear his name, and so it\r\nwas agreed.\r\n\r\nThus the material problem was solved. Name and habitation were\r\nfound; it remained only to organize the work for which so fitting a\r\nhome had been provided. Mr. Anderson's gift was received toward the\r\nclose of March, and, in the course of the following month, the\r\npreliminaries were concluded, and the property was transferred to\r\nthe trustees of the Anderson School.\r\n\r\nFew men would have thought it feasible to build dormitories and\r\nlaboratories, and provide working apparatus for fifty pupils as\r\nwell as for a large corps of teachers, between May and July. But to\r\nAgassiz no obstacles seemed insurmountable where great aims were\r\ninvolved, and the opening of the school was announced for the 8th\r\nof July. He left Boston on Friday, the 4th of July, for the island.\r\nAt New Bedford he was met by a warning from the architect that it\r\nwould be simply impossible to open the school at the appointed\r\ndate. With characteristic disregard of practical difficulties, he\r\nanswered that it must be possible, for postponement was out of the\r\nquestion. He reached the island on Saturday, the 5th, in the\r\nafternoon. The aspect was certainly discouraging. The dormitory was\r\nup, but only the frame was completed; there were no floors, nor was\r\nthe roof shingled. The next day was Sunday. Agassiz called the\r\ncarpenters together. He told them that the scheme was neither for\r\nmoney, nor for the making of money; no personal gain was involved\r\nin it. It was for the best interests of education, and for that\r\nalone. Having explained the object, and stated the emergency, he\r\nasked whether, under these circumstances, the next day was properly\r\nfor rest or for work. They all answered \"for work.\" They\r\naccordingly worked the following day from dawn till dark, and by\r\nnight-fall the floors were laid. On Monday, the 7th, the partitions\r\nwere put up, dividing the upper story into two large dormitories;\r\nthe lower, into sufficiently convenient working-rooms. On Tuesday\r\nmorning (the 8th), with the help of a few volunteers, chiefly\r\nladies connected with the school, who had arrived a day or two in\r\nadvance, the dormitories, which were still encumbered by shavings,\r\nsawdust, etc., were swept, and presently transformed into not\r\nunattractive sleeping-halls. They were divided by neat sets of\r\nfurniture into equal spaces, above each of which was placed the\r\nname of the person to whom it was appropriated. When all was done,\r\nthe large open rooms, with their fresh pine walls, floors, and\r\nceilings, the rows of white beds down the sides, and the many\r\nwindows looking to the sea, were pretty and inviting enough. If\r\nthey somewhat resembled hospital wards, they were too airy and\r\ncheerful to suggest sickness either of body or mind.\r\n\r\nNext, a large barn belonging to Mr. Anderson's former establishment\r\nwas cleared, and a new floor laid there also. This was hardly\r\nfinished (the last nails were just driven) when the steamer, with\r\nits large company, touched the wharf. There was barely time to\r\narrange the seats and to place a table with flowers where the\r\nguests of honor were to sit, and Agassiz himself was to stand, when\r\nall arrived. The barn was, on the whole, not a bad lecture-room on\r\na beautiful summer day. The swallows, who had their nests without\r\nnumber in the rafters, flew in and out, and twittered softly\r\noverhead; and the wide doors, standing broadly open to the blue sky\r\nand the fresh fields let in the sea-breeze, and gave a view of the\r\nlittle domain. Agassiz had arranged no programme of exercises,\r\ntrusting to the interest of the occasion to suggest what might best\r\nbe said or done. But, as he looked upon his pupils gathered there\r\nto study nature with him, by an impulse as natural as it was\r\nunpremeditated, he called upon them to join in silently asking\r\nGod's blessing on their work together. The pause was broken by the\r\nfirst words of an address no less fervent than its unspoken\r\nprelude.* (* This whole scene is fitly told in Whittier's poem,\r\n\"The Prayer of Agassiz\".)\r\n\r\nThus the day, which had been anticipated with so much anxiety,\r\npassed off, unclouded by any untoward accident, and at evening the\r\nguests had departed. Students and teachers, a company of some fifty\r\nor sixty persons, were left to share the island with the sea-gulls\r\nwhose haunt it was.\r\n\r\nWe will not enter into the daily details of the school. It was a\r\nnew phase of teaching, even for Agassiz, old as he was in the work.\r\nMost of his pupils were mature men and women, some of whom had been\r\nteachers themselves for many years. He had, therefore, trained\r\nminds to deal with, and the experience was at that time as novel as\r\nit was interesting. The novelty has worn off now. Summer schools\r\nfor advanced students, and especially for teachers, have taken\r\ntheir place in the general system of education; and, though the\r\nPenikese school may be said to have died with its master, it lives\r\nanew in many a sea-side laboratory organized on the same plan, in\r\nsummer schools of Botany and field classes of Geology. The impetus\r\nit gave was not, and cannot be, lost, since it refreshed and\r\nvitalized methods of teaching.\r\n\r\nBeside the young men who formed his corps of teachers, among whom\r\nthe resident professors were Dr. Burt G. Wilder, of Cornell\r\nUniversity, and Professor Alpheus S. Packard, now of Brown\r\nUniversity, Agassiz had with him some of his oldest friends and\r\ncolleagues. Count de Pourtales was there, superintending the\r\ndredging, for which there were special conveniences, Mr. Charles G.\r\nGalloupe having presented the school with a yacht for the express\r\npurpose. This generous gift gave Agassiz the greatest pleasure, and\r\ncompleted the outfit of the school as nothing else could have done.\r\nProfessor Arnold Guyot, also,--Agassiz's comrade in younger years,\r\n--his companion in many an Alpine excursion,--came to the island to\r\ngive a course of lectures, and remained for some time. It was their\r\nlast meeting in this world, and together they lived over their days\r\nof youthful adventure. The lectures of the morning and afternoon\r\nwould sometimes be followed by an informal meeting held on a little\r\nhill, which was a favorite resort at sunset. There the whole\r\ncommunity gathered around the two old friends, to hear them talk of\r\ntheir glacial explorations, one recalling what the other had\r\nforgotten, till the scenes lived again for themselves, and became\r\nalmost equally vivid for their listeners. The subject came up\r\nnaturally, for, strange to say, this island in a New England bay\r\nwas very suggestive of glacial phenomena. Erratic materials and\r\nboulders transported from the north were scattered over its\r\nsurface, and Agassiz found the illustrations for his lectures on\r\nthis topic ready to his hand. Indeed, some of his finest lectures\r\non the ice-period were given at Penikese.\r\n\r\nNothing could be less artificial, more free from constraint or\r\nformality, than the intercourse between him and his companions of\r\nthis summer. He was at home with every member of the settlement.\r\nIll-health did not check the readiness of his sympathy; languor did\r\nnot chill the glow of his enthusiasm. All turned to him for help\r\nand inspiration. Walking over their little sovereignty together,\r\nhunting for specimens on its beaches, dredging from the boats, in\r\nthe laboratory, or the lecture-room, the instruction had always the\r\ncharacter of the freest discussion. Yet the work, although combined\r\nwith out-of-door pleasures, and not without a certain holiday\r\nelement, was no play. On the part of the students, the application\r\nwas close and unremitting; on the part of the teachers, the\r\ninstruction, though untrammeled by routine, was sustained and\r\nsystematic.\r\n\r\nAgassiz himself frequently gave two lectures a day. In the morning\r\nsession he would prepare his class for the work of the day; in the\r\nafternoon he would draw out their own observations by questions,\r\nand lead them, by comparison and combination of the facts they had\r\nobserved, to understand the significance of their results. Every\r\nlecture from him at this time was a lesson in teaching as well as\r\nin natural history, and to many of his hearers this gave his\r\nlectures a twofold value, as bearing directly upon their own\r\noccupation. In his opening address he had said to them: \"You will\r\nfind the same elements of instruction all about you wherever you\r\nmay be teaching. You can take your classes out, and give them the\r\nsame lessons, and lead them up to the same subjects you are\r\nyourselves studying here. And this mode of teaching children is so\r\nnatural, so suggestive, so true. That is the charm of teaching from\r\nNature herself. No one can warp her to suit his own views. She\r\nbrings us back to absolute truth as often as we wander.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the bright side of the picture. Those who stood nearest to\r\nAgassiz, however, felt that the strain not only of work, but of the\r\nanxiety and responsibility attendant upon a new and important\r\nundertaking, was perilous for him. There were moments when this\r\nbecame apparent, and he himself felt the danger. He persevered,\r\nnevertheless, to the end of the summer, and only left Penikese when\r\nthe school broke up.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the story of this final effort unbroken, some\r\nevents of great interest to Agassiz and of importance to the Museum\r\nhave been omitted. In the spring the Museum had received a grant of\r\n25,000 dollars from the Legislature. To this was added 100,000\r\ndollars, a birthday gift to Agassiz in behalf of the institution he\r\nso much loved. This last sum was controlled by no official body and\r\nwas to be expended at his own good will and pleasure, either in\r\ncollections, publications, or scientific assistance, as seemed to\r\nhim best. He therefore looked forward to a year of greater ease and\r\nefficiency in scientific work than he had ever enjoyed before. On\r\nreturning from Penikese, full of the new possibilities thus opened\r\nto him, he allowed himself a short rest, partly at the sea-shore,\r\npartly in the mountains, and was again at his post in the Museum in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nHis last course of lectures there was on one of his favorite\r\ntopics,--the type of Radiates as connected with the physical\r\nhistory of the earth, from the dawn of organic life till now. In\r\nhis opening lecture he said to his class: \"You must learn to look\r\nupon fossil forms as the antiquarian looks upon his coins. The\r\nremains of animals and plants have the spirit of their time\r\nimpressed upon them, as strongly as the spirit of the age is\r\nimpressed upon its architecture, its literature, its coinage. I\r\nwant you to become so familiar with these forms, that you can read\r\noff at a glance their character and associations.\" In this spirit\r\nhis last course was conceived. It was as far-reaching and as clear\r\nas usual, nor did his delivery evince failure of strength or of\r\nmental power. If he showed in any way the disease which was even\r\nthen upon him, it was by an over-tension of the nerves, which gave\r\nincreased fervor to his manner. Every mental effort was, however,\r\nsucceeded by great physical fatigue.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he had undertaken a series of articles in the\r\n\"Atlantic Monthly,\" entitled, \"Evolution and Permanence of Type.\"\r\nThey were to have contained his own convictions regarding the\r\nconnection between all living beings, upon which his studies had\r\nled him to conclusions so different from the philosophy of the day.\r\nOf these papers, only one was completed. It was his last word upon\r\nscience; the correction of the proofsheets was the last act of his\r\nworking life, and the article was published after his death. In it\r\nhe claimed that the law of evolution, in a certain sense as true to\r\nhim as to any so-called evolutionist, was a law \"controlling\r\ndevelopment, and keeping types within appointed cycles of growth.\"\r\nHe maintained that this law acts within definite limits, and never\r\ninfringes upon the great types, each one of which is, in his view,\r\na structural unit in itself. Even metamorphoses, he adds, \"have all\r\nthe constancy and invariability of other modes of embryonic growth,\r\nand have never been known to lead to any transition of one species\r\ninto another.\" Of heredity he says: \"The whole subject of\r\ninheritance is exceedingly intricate, working often in a seemingly\r\ncapricious and fitful way. Qualities, both good and bad, are\r\ndropped as well as acquired, and the process ends sometimes in the\r\ndegradation of the type, and the survival of the unfit rather than\r\nthe fittest. The most trifling and fantastic tricks of inheritance\r\nare quoted in support of the transmutation theory; but little is\r\nsaid of the sudden apparition of powerful original qualities, which\r\nalmost always rise like pure creations, and are gone with their day\r\nand generation. The noblest gifts are exceptional, and are rarely\r\ninherited; this very fact seems to me an evidence of something more\r\nand higher than mere evolution and transmission concerned in the\r\nproblem of life. In the same way the matter of natural and sexual\r\nselection is susceptible of very various interpretations. No doubt,\r\non the whole, Nature protects her best. But it would not be\r\ndifficult to bring together an array of facts as striking as those\r\nproduced by the evolutionists in favor of their theory, to show\r\nthat sexual selection is by no means always favorable to the\r\nelimination of the chaff, and the preservation of the wheat. A\r\nnatural attraction, independent of strength or beauty, is an\r\nunquestionable element in this problem, and its action is seen\r\namong animals as well as among men. The fact that fine progeny are\r\nnot infrequently the offspring of weak parents, and vice versa,\r\npoints, perhaps, to some innate power of redress by which the\r\ncaprices of choice are counterbalanced. But there can be no doubt\r\nthat types are as often endangered as protected by the so-called\r\nlaw of sexual selection.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to the influence of climate and physical conditions,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"we all know their power for evil and for good upon\r\nliving beings. But there is, nevertheless, nothing more striking in\r\nthe whole book of nature than the power shown by types and species\r\nto resist physical conditions. Endless evidence may be brought from\r\nthe whole expanse of land and air and water, showing that identical\r\nphysical conditions will do nothing toward the merging of species\r\ninto one another, neither will variety of conditions do anything\r\ntoward their multiplication. One thing only we know absolutely, and\r\nin this treacherous, marshy ground of hypothesis and assumption, it\r\nis pleasant to plant one's foot occasionally upon a solid fact here\r\nand there. Whatever be the means of preserving and transmitting\r\nproperties, the primitive types have remained permanent and\r\nunchanged,--in the long succession of ages, amid all the appearance\r\nand disappearance of kinds, the fading away of one species and the\r\ncoming in of another,--from the earliest geological periods to the\r\npresent day. How these types were first introduced, how the species\r\nwhich have successively represented them have replaced one another,\r\n--these are the vital questions to which no answer has been given.\r\nWe are as far from any satisfactory solution of this problem as if\r\ndevelopment theories had never been discussed.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he sketches the plan of these articles. \"I hope in\r\nfuture articles to show, first, that, however broken the geological\r\nrecord may be, there is a complete sequence in many parts of it,\r\nfrom which the character of the succession may be ascertained;\r\nsecondly, that, since the most exquisitely delicate structures, as\r\nwell as embryonic phases of growth of the most perishable nature,\r\nhave been preserved from very early deposits, we have no right to\r\ninfer the disappearance of types because their absence disproves\r\nsome favorite theory; and, lastly, that there is no evidence of a\r\ndirect descent of later from earlier species in the geological\r\nsuccession of animals.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper contained the sentence so often quoted since, \"A\r\nphysical fact is as sacred as a moral principle. Our own nature\r\ndemands from us this double allegiance.\" This expressed the secret\r\nof his whole life. Every fact in nature was sacred to him, as part\r\nof an intellectual conception expressed in the history of the earth\r\nand the beings living upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of December, he was called to a meeting of the\r\nMassachusetts Board of Agriculture at Fitchburg, where he lectured\r\nin the evening on \"The structural growth of domesticated animals.\"\r\nThose who accompanied him, and knew the mental and physical\r\ndepression which had hung about him for weeks, could not see him\r\ntake his place on the platform, without anxiety. And yet, when he\r\nturned to the blackboard, and, with a single sweep of the chalk,\r\ndrew the faultless outline of an egg, it seemed impossible that\r\nanything could be amiss with the hand or the brain that were so\r\nsteady and so clear.\r\n\r\nThe end, nevertheless, was very near. Although he dined with\r\nfriends the next day, and was present at a family festival that\r\nweek, he spoke of a dimness of sight, and of feeling \"strangely\r\nasleep.\" On the 6th he returned early from the Museum, complaining\r\nof great weariness, and from that time he never left his room.\r\nAttended in his illness by his friends, Dr. Brown-Sequard and Dr.\r\nMorrill Wyman, and surrounded by his family, the closing week of\r\nhis life was undisturbed by acute suffering and full of domestic\r\nhappiness. Even the voices of his brother and sisters were not\r\nwholly silent, for the wires that thrill with so many human\r\ninterests brought their message of greeting and farewell across the\r\nocean to his bedside. The thoughts and aims for which he had lived\r\nwere often on his lips, but the affections were more vivid than the\r\nintellect in these last hours. The end came very peacefully, on the\r\n14th of December, 1873. He lies buried at Mount Auburn. The boulder\r\nthat makes his monument came from the glacier of the Aar, not far\r\nfrom the spot where his hut once stood; and the pine-trees which\r\nare fast growing up to shelter it were sent by loving hands from\r\nhis old home in Switzerland. The land of his birth and the land of\r\nhis adoption are united in his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nAar, glacier.\r\nlast visit to.\r\nboulder-monument from.\r\n\r\nAbert,
