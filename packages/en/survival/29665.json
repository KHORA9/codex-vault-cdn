One is\r\nbecause the soil is not kept clear of weeds, and the other is that it is\r\nnot properly enriched. To raise a good crop of onions requires a light,\r\nloamy soil, worked into as fine a condition as possible, to render\r\ncultivation easy.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the preparation should be done in the fall, and\r\nespecially the application of the manure. Well rotted manure is the\r\nbest, and that which is free from grass, oats, or weed seeds, should\r\nalways be selected. Of course, if the manure is properly rotted the\r\nvitality of the larger portion of the seed in it will be killed, but\r\nunless this is done it will render the cultivation much more difficult.\r\nStiff, clayey, or hard, poor land can be made a great deal better for\r\nthe onion crop by a heavy application of ashes or well rotted bagasse. I\r\nprefer to apply ashes as a top dressing in the spring, working it in the\r\nsurface, as I find by experience that they are not only valuable as a\r\nfertilizer when used in this way, but are also of great benefit in\r\nkeeping down the weeds.\r\n\r\nA plot of ground that is seeded with crab-grass should not be selected,\r\nas the pulling up of the grass injures the growth of the onions. Onions\r\nfeed near the surface; in fact, the larger portion of the bulb grows on\r\ntop of the soil, and as a natural consequence the plant food should be\r\nwell worked in the surface. Of course it is too late now to talk about\r\nfall preparation. If we want a crop of onions from seed this spring,\r\nwhatever preparation there is must be done between now and seeding. I\r\nshould plow or spade up the soil as soon as possible, if there is a thaw\r\nout either the last of this or any part of next month.\r\n\r\nIf you can save up and rot a supply of poultry manure and leaves, you\r\ncan have the very best manure for a good onion crop.\r\n\r\nAnother important point in raising a good crop of onions is to have good\r\nseed and sow it early. The first favorable time in the spring must be\r\ntaken advantage of, if you would have the best success with your crop.\r\nAs good seed is necessary in any crop, so it is with onions. Test your\r\nseed before risking your entire crop, as by the time you plant once and\r\nfail, and procure seed and plant again, it will be too late to make a\r\ngood crop. I always take advantage of the first chance in March to sow\r\nmy onion seed. We usually have a few warm days sometime about the middle\r\nof the month when this work can be done. Of course I do not say that\r\nthis is the case every year. The first favorable opportunity should be\r\ntaken advantage of, is what I want to impress upon those who expect to\r\nmake a crop; let this time come when it will, any time early in the\r\nspring. If the ground has been plowed or spaded well during the winter,\r\na good harrowing or raking should be given. If you have the poultry\r\nmanure, now is the best time to apply it, working it on top of the soil\r\nwith a rake. If you have not the poultry manure and have ashes, give a\r\ngood strong dressing of ashes, raking evenly over the surface. Mark off\r\nin drills twelve inches apart, and not more than one inch deep; lay off\r\nthe drills as narrow and as straight as possible, and then drill the\r\nseed evenly. Try to keep them in a straight row, as it will aid much in\r\nthe cultivation. Cover lightly, but press the soil firmly upon the seed.\r\nThey will withstand considerable cold, damp weather before rotting.\r\n\r\nLast year I sowed my onion seed on the 23d of March; the next ten days\r\nwere cold, rainy, dark, dismal days, with two or three freezes. Yet my\r\nonions came up all right and made a good crop.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the shoots make their appearance above the ground a good\r\nraking with a fine steel rake can be given. This will give them a good\r\nstart and destroy the young weeds that will begin to make their\r\nappearance at the same time. After the onions start to grow, cultivation\r\nis the making of the crop, and the cleaner they are kept and the oftener\r\nthe surface is stirred the better will be the crop.\r\n\r\nAs to varieties, the old Red Wethersfield and the Danvers Yellow are my\r\nfavorites. The Yellow Strasburg is a good yellow variety, and there are\r\nquite a number of others that are good. In cultivating I keep the\r\nsurface level, as they do better if kept in this way than if they are\r\nhilled up. Thin out so that the plants do not crowd each other--they\r\nshould stand two or three inches apart--if you want large onions at\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n    N. J. SHEPHERD\r\n        MILLER CO., MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYALIST 3D, 4500.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Royalist 3^{rd} 4500\r\n\r\nElmwood Stock Farm\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF COL. C. F. MILLS, SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.]\r\n\r\nThe bull Royalist 3d, 4500, here portrayed, stands at the head of the\r\nsuperb Jersey herd owned by Col. Charles F. Mills, Springfield,\r\nIllinois. He was bred by Mr. Samuel Stratton; dropped December 13, 1878;\r\ngot by imp. Royalist 2906; dam imp. Nelly 6456. Royalist 2906 received\r\nthe first prize over all Jersey in 1877; first prize and silver cup at\r\nSt. Saviour's Show in 1877; first prize at the great St. Louis Fair as\r\na three-year-old, and grand sweepstakes at St. Louis Fair in 1879 as the\r\nbest Jersey bull of any age. Her sire, Duke (76), won first prize over\r\nthe Island, Herd Book Parochial prize, and first Herd Book prize at\r\nRoyal Jersey Show in 1875. Merry Boy (61), I. H. B., grandsire of\r\nRoyalist 2906, won first prize at St. Mary's Show in 1874. Stockwell II\r\n(24), I. H. B., great-great-grandsire of Royalist 2906, won third prize\r\nover the Island and second Herd Book prize at the Royal Jersey Show,\r\n1871; the bronze medal at the Channel Island Exhibition in 1871, and\r\nthird prize at the Royal Jersey Show in 1872.\r\n\r\nNelly, the dam of Royalist 3d, 4500, has produced 21 pounds of butter in\r\nseven days since importation, and Mr. Stratton is authority for the\r\nstatement that she received the special prize at the Farmers' Club,\r\nIsland of Jersey, for the best butter cow, having made 16 pounds Jersey\r\nweight of 18 ounces to the pound, or 18 avoirdupois pounds, in seven\r\ndays. Her sire, Lemon (170), is the grandsire of Mr. C. Easthope's\r\ncelebrated Nancy Lee 7618 (test 95 lbs. 3-1/2 oz. unsalted butter in 31\r\ndays), and Daisy of St. Peters 18175 (test 20 lbs. 5-1/2 oz. unsalted\r\nbutter in seven days).\r\n\r\nTaking all things into consideration, we doubt if there is a better\r\nJersey bull in the world than Royalist 3d. Certainly he has no superior\r\nin this country. Mr. Mills' Jersey herd is a model in all respects, and\r\nthe popular chief clerk in the State Agricultural rooms may well be\r\nproud of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Importers' and Breeders' Association, Minneapolis,\r\nMinn., have bought $20,000 worth of Fresian stock of the Unadilla\r\nCompany, West Edmeston, N.

In the majority of cases the demand\r\nhas been fair; in a few very brisk; in quite a number it was said that\r\nsales could be made only at a reduction in prices. It was easy to see\r\nthat in some sections of the State the work of tile-making was overdone,\r\nthat is, the supply is in excess of the demand. It was the general\r\nexpression that prices could not be greatly reduced and leave a\r\nreasonable profit to the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nHOW TO INCREASE THE DEMAND\r\n\r\nwas the question this year. Last year at this convention the talk was\r\nupon \"How shall we supply the demand?\" The answers to the question of\r\nhow to increase the demand were various. Some advocated a rigid\r\nadherence to fair living prices, and thus teach farmers that it is\r\nuseless to wait for cheaper tile; make a first-class article and the\r\ncheap tile that is hurting the trade will be forced out of the market.\r\nThere was a general advocacy of a wider dissemination of a knowledge of\r\nthe benefits of drainage. Show farmers and fruit-growers that they can\r\nadd new acres to their farms, and take from tiled land a sufficiently\r\nincreased yield the first year to pay for tiling, and that their land is\r\nworth more dollars per acre after tiling than the expense amounts to,\r\nand the demand will multiply many fold. Teach the farmers how to lay\r\ntheir drains properly, so that no disappointment will result, and every\r\nacre drained will advertise the profits from drainage. Circulate facts\r\nin regard to drainage as contributed to the agricultural papers, and\r\neven the newspapers. Subscribe for these papers and distribute them.\r\nCirculate the essays read at tile-makers' conventions. Talk drainage\r\neverywhere and at all times. These were among the means sensibly\r\nadvocated for increasing the demand for tile.\r\n\r\nWINTER TILE-MAKING.\r\n\r\nIt is but recently that the manufacture of tile has been carried on in\r\nwinter, but now many establishments are running the year round. It was\r\nnot claimed that the business can be prosecuted as advantageously in\r\nwinter as in summer. But it gives employment to men, and the\r\nmanufactories are thus enabled to keep skilled labor always on hand. It\r\nwas thought that though the profits are small it is really better to run\r\nin winter where there is a demand for tile. In most cases it is better\r\nto make brick a portion of the year. There is always a demand for good\r\nbrick at paying prices. If it will not pay to produce all tile, or so\r\nmuch tile as may be turned out, this will afford relief and keep the\r\nmachine in motion.\r\n\r\nTILE MACHINERY.\r\n\r\nMr. Billingsby, whose position allows him an excellent opportunity of\r\njudging, said there has been rapid improvement in the machinery for\r\ntile-making. Great advance has been made in machines for preparing clay,\r\nespecially in the rapidity of handling it. The buildings for drying tile\r\nwere a great deal better than five years ago. The means of ventilation\r\nare becoming excellent. The kilns are better and can be more\r\nsatisfactorily managed. There is yet need for a cheaper tile\r\nfactory--one where the investment of only a few hundred dollars will\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nPROTECTING DRAINS.\r\n\r\nIt was generally conceded that it is best to have some device at the end\r\nof the drains to keep out rabbits, water animals, etc. Wires stretched\r\nacross did pretty well but must be carefully looked after to clear away\r\nthe roots and refuse that come through the drains. Two or three devices\r\nto take the place of wire were exhibited and were generally thought to\r\nbe greatly superior.\r\n\r\nOPEN DITCHES.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of this convention was the introduction, for the\r\nfirst time, of the discussion of tile ditching by machinery in a paper\r\nprepared by Hon. F. Plumb, of Streator, Ill. Mr. Plumb has been\r\nexperimenting for several years with tile ditches, using both animal and\r\nsteam power. He gave it as his conclusion that the machine of the future\r\nwould be a machine that would perfect the ditch by one passage over the\r\nground. He has perfected and is now manufacturing a steam power machine,\r\nat Streator, Ill., which is spoken of very highly by all who have seen\r\nit at work in the field. Mr. Plumb claims that the machine will cut\r\ntwenty rods of three-foot ditch in an hour, and give a grade and finish\r\nto the bottom of the ditch equal to the very best hand work. The\r\ncapacity of the machine is varied to any depth up to four feet, and for\r\nany sized tile up to nine-inch. Two men can operate the machine. The\r\ncost of cutting ditches, laying and covering tile is reduced to about\r\nten cents per rod. He has already sold several of his machines, and is\r\nto be congratulated on the success he has attained in securing a good\r\ntile ditcher. We can conceive of no one thing that will conduce to the\r\nsale and use of tile so much as such a machine as the Plumb Steam Tile\r\nDitcher. The machine is indorsed by C. G. Elliott, of Tonica, Drainage\r\nEngineer; by Mr. Pike, President of the convention, and others who have\r\nseen it at work in the field.\r\n\r\nLAYING TILE BY MACHINERY.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing among the devices exhibited at this convention that\r\nattracted more attention or received more favorable private comment than\r\na model of Chamberlin Brothers' Patent Apparatus for Tiling. The model\r\nonly was shown, but working machines are in operation in Iowa, and they\r\nare giving excellent satisfaction, as attested by such men as Thos. B.\r\nWales, Jr., of Iowa City, and Daniel H. Wheeler, Secretary of the\r\nNebraska State Board of Agriculture. The apparatus is upon the old\r\nprinciple of the mole ditcher requiring the same capstan power. One team\r\nis sufficient to run it. The apparatus is composed of a beam or sill,\r\nhorizontal in position, and a coulter seven feet long at the rear end of\r\nthe beam, and perpendicular to it a spirit level attached to the beam,\r\naids in regulating. The coulter can be run anywhere from one to five\r\nfeet deep. The front end of the beam is provided with a mud or stone\r\nboat to prevent sinking in the mud, and with a jack screw for regulating\r\non uneven ground. Attached to it, and following the mole, is a carrier\r\n200 feet long, made concave in form. On this the tile are laid and\r\ncarried into the ground. A start is made at an open ditch or hole of\r\nrequired depth; when the carrier is drawn in full length a hole is dug\r\njust back of the coulter, two by three feet, down to the tile, a stop\r\nplaced in front of the tile, the machine is started which draws the\r\ncarrier from under the tile, when it is again located as before, and so\r\non. Different sized moles are used according to the size of the tile to\r\nbe laid. Any one can easily count up the advantages of this mode of\r\nlaying tile, provided the machine can do the work it is claimed to do,\r\nand of this there seems to be no question, if we may believe the\r\ntestimony of those who have seen it in operation.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE LAWS.\r\n\r\nThe following by Senator Whiting, of Bureau county, was read by the\r\nSecretary:\r\n\r\nIllinois is a good State as nature made her, and drainage is destined to\r\nadd wealth almost inestimable. Drainage enterprises are everywhere\r\nseen--in extent from the small work beginning and ending in the same\r\nfield, to the levees of Sny Carte, and the canal-like channels through\r\nthe Winnebago swamps. Drainage is naturally divided into two classes:\r\n\r\n1. Individual drainage, where the land-owner has his own outlet\r\nindependent of others.\r\n\r\n2. Combined drainage where one can not drain without joining with\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of these combined works is where two only are concerned.\r\nThe Hickory Creek ditch now in progress in Bureau and Henry counties is\r\nthirteen miles long, has a district of about 15,000 acres, owned by over\r\nseventy-five persons. This combined drainage partakes of the nature of\r\npublic works. For this class the constitution has been twice amended,\r\nand many elaborate laws have been enacted. These laws have had their\r\nvicissitudes, and are not yet free from complications. The first\r\ndrainage legislation commenced forty years ago, by a special act, to\r\ndrain some wet lands near Chicago. In 1859 two special acts were passed\r\nfor lands on the American bottoms. In 1865 a general act was passed. All\r\nthese enactments were under the constitution of 1848 which was silent on\r\ndrainage, and the courts annulled most of these as unconstitutional. In\r\n1870 the new constitution was framed containing a brief provision on\r\ndrainage. The late Mr. Browning, a leading member of that convention,\r\ndrafted a drainage bill which was enacted into a law without change.\r\nLarge enterprises were organized and got well started; but again some\r\ncomplaining person appealed to the courts, and this law too, was\r\ndeclared too big for the constitution. The constitution was then\r\nenlarged to meet if possible, the views of the court. Two elaborate laws\r\non the main question were passed in 1879, and these with several\r\namendments since made rest undisturbed on the statutes. One of these is\r\ngenerally known as the \"levee law,\" and the other as the \"farm drainage\r\nact.\" They cover nearly the same subject matter, and were passed to\r\ncompromise conflicting views. These laws relate to \"combined drainage.\"\r\n\"Individual drainage\" was not discussed. As the law does not undertake\r\nto define how deep you may plow or what crop you shall raise, so it was\r\nthought unnecessary to make any provisions about the drainage of your\r\nown land.\r\n\r\nCOURT DECISION.--To the public surprise the Appellate court at Ottawa in\r\ntwo decisions pronounced individual drainage unlawful. As this decision\r\nis notable, and the subject of controversy, its history should be known.\r\nIn 1876, Mr. C. Pilgrim, of Bureau county, laid about sixty rods of\r\ntwo-inch tile up a slight depression in his corn-field, discharging the\r\nsame under a box culvert in the public road. This depression continued\r\ninto a pasture field of Mr. J. H. Mellor, of Stark county, about\r\neighteen rods to a running stream. Mr. Mellor sued Mr. Pilgrim for\r\ntrespass, and the case was twice tried successively in the circuit\r\ncourts of Stark and Bureau counties. The juries each time decided for\r\nMr. Pilgrim, but the Appellate court each time reversed the decision;\r\nand finally worried Mr. Pilgrim into yielding to a judgment of one cent\r\ndamages. The material part of that decision is as follows:\r\n\r\nMELLOR VS. PILGRIM.--\"The appellant had the right to own and possess his\r\nland free from the increased burden arising from receiving the surface\r\nwater from the land of appellee through artificial channels made by\r\nappellee, for the purpose of carrying the surface water therefrom more\r\nrapidly than the same would naturally flow; and the appellant having\r\nsuch right for any invasion thereof the law gives him an action. * * *\r\nIf, as we have seen, the appellee by making the drain in question\r\ncollected the surface water upon his own land and discharged the same\r\nupon the lands of the appellant in increased quantity and in a different\r\nmanner than the same would naturally run, the act was unlawful because\r\nof its consequences, and the subjecting of appellant's lands to such\r\nincreased and different burden than would otherwise attach to it, was an\r\ninvasion of appellant's rights from which the law implies damages, and\r\nin such case proof of the wrongful act entitles the plaintiff to recover\r\nnominal damages at least.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this decision it is not easy to see how a man can lawfully cut a\r\nrod of ditch or lay tile on his own land, unless he can contrive some\r\nway to stop the flow of water.\r\n\r\n1. The lower man may recover without proving that he is damaged because\r\nto drain is \"wrongful.\"\r\n\r\n2. Such drainage being a continuing trespass, subjects the perpetrator\r\nto never ending law suits and foredoomed defeats.\r\n\r\n3. The lower man may forbid you to drain, or exact such tribute as he\r\nmay dictate.\r\n\r\n4. As the first man below must be consulted, why not the second, and how\r\nfar this side of the Gulf is the limit of this trespass?\r\n\r\nHere, as I have elsewhere, I challenge this as bad law. It reverses the\r\norder of nature, as well as custom, and can not be endured as the public\r\npolicy of Illinois. Let us contemplate the exact opposite principle. \"A\r\nland owner may drain his land for agricultural purposes by tile or open\r\nditch, in the line of natural drainage, into any natural outlet on his\r\nown land or into any drainage depression leading to some natural\r\noutlet.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition is generally regarded as self evident, but out of\r\nrespect to the court, let us give some of the considerations on which it\r\nrests:\r\n\r\n1. Improved agriculture is an element in civilization.\r\n\r\n2. Drainage belongs to good agriculture, is extensively practiced and\r\nmust often precede the plow.\r\n\r\n3. The surplus water can not be stored or annihilated, and the course of\r\ndrainage is indicated, in most places determined by nature, in the\r\ndrainage depressions which are nature's outlets.\r\n\r\n4. The law of gravity, with or without man's work, is constant and\r\nactive in moving the waters to the lower level. The ditcher's art is to\r\nremove the obstacles to a freer flow.\r\n\r\n5. Excessive water is a foe to agriculture; and for the general good it\r\nshould be collected into channels, and as speedily as possible passed\r\nalong on its inevitable journey.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS ANSWERED.--It is said to be a universal law maxim, \"that you\r\nmay use your own as you will, but not to the detriment of your\r\nneighbor,\" and that this principle forbids this kind of drainage. This\r\nmaxim may be general, but it is not universal. My neighbor may have\r\nbuilt his house and other domestic arrangements in the lee of a natural\r\ngrove of timber on my land. The removal of this grove may be a real\r\ngrievance by giving the wind too free a sweep; yet my right to change\r\nthis waste into a grain field will not be questioned. My warranty deed\r\nis my right thus to improve my land, though it be \"to the detriment of\r\nmy neighbor.\" He should have foreseen the contingency of a removal of\r\nthese woods. On like principles a land owner may remove an excess of\r\nwater so as to raise corn and not rushes. In the removal of woods my\r\nneighbor may not have an immediate remedy for his ills, but the effect\r\nof my ditches may be turned to good account by continuing them, and thus\r\nimproving his land as I have mine. My warranty deed is my right to\r\ncultivate my own land, and this right carries the right to cultivate it\r\nin the best manner. The lower man should have taken judicial notice that\r\nwater runs down hill, and that in this progressive age ditches may be\r\ncut and tiles laid.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that this court decision follows the English Common law;\r\nand now being settled by a decision, it is not open for further\r\nconsideration. In this progressive age nothing is settled until it is\r\nsettled right. Judge Taney once judicially settled the status of the\r\nAfrican race. The common law was held to forbid the bridging of\r\nnavigable streams. Harbors could only be made where the water was salt\r\nand affected by the tides. The Dartmouth college decision was held to so\r\ncover railroad corporations as to shield them from legislative control.\r\nThese have all been overturned by the march of events, and this\r\nAppellate court decision is not necessarily immortal. For fifty years\r\nthe farmers of Illinois knew no such rule. The public roads have been\r\nimproved by side ditches which dropped the water into the first\r\ndepression. In 1873 there was placed in the road law a provision that a\r\nland owner may drain on the public road by giving timely notice, and\r\nthis stands through all revisions. Blackstone in his commentaries does\r\nnot class this kind of drainage as a nuisance or trespass to lower\r\nlands, but he does its opposite, where the lower man neglects to \"scour\"\r\na ditch, and thus sets back the water to the harm of the upper man. If\r\nthis court rule is common law, as claimed, then it may be further said\r\nthat a rule for the dark ages when drainage was exceptional, is not\r\nnecessarily the true rule, since drainage has become so large a part of\r\ngood agriculture.\r\n\r\nACTION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.--Early in the last session, bills were\r\nintroduced into each House to overturn this court decision. These were\r\ndefeated, but late in the session there passed with much unanimity a\r\nbill of the following title, which became a law: \"An act to permit\r\nowners of land to construct drains for agricultural purposes.\" Sec. 1 of\r\nthis act reads as follows: \"That the owner or owners of land in this\r\nState shall be permitted to construct drains for agricultural purposes,\r\nonly, into any natural water-course or any natural depression whereby\r\nthe water will be carried into any natural water-course, or any drain on\r\nthe public highway, if the road commissioners consent thereto, for the\r\npurpose of securing proper drainage to such land, without being liable\r\nin damages therefor to any other person or persons or corporation.\" This\r\nwas intended to establish the right of \"individual drainage.\"\r\n\r\nBut we are told that the courts will not respect this law, for the\r\nreason that it seeks to legalize trespass.\r\n\r\nHere we join issue with our objectors and stand by this declaratory law.\r\nIt embodies the general opinion and practice of the people; it is\r\nplainly conformable to the physical laws of nature and the requirements\r\nof civilization. Lands are held subject to laws thus grounded, and these\r\nconsiderations will not tolerate laws or decisions the very opposite.\r\n\r\nThese declarations are not much more radical than a declaration that we\r\nstand by the law of gravity as constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe public are busy in overturning this court decision by everywhere\r\ndisregarding it. The few who stopped draining in deference to the court,\r\nhave resumed under shelter of the statute. If all violators should be\r\nprosecuted with vigor, tile-making might decline, but courting would be\r\nlively. Courts and judges must be multiplied, and every lawyer in the\r\nState would have fat business for the next ten years. Some judge will\r\nsoon give us a precedent in accordance with reason, and this will settle\r\nthe matter as effectually as did one taste of the tree of knowledge\r\nreveal good and evil. It will soon be seen that individual interest is\r\nbest promoted by general and free drainage--that presumption should be\r\nin its favor, and that one man should not be clothed with power to stop\r\nothers from making improvements.\r\n\r\nNEW LAWS.--The next legislative work on drainage should be to revise and\r\nconsolidate the law. On some points the law is duplicate, and on one\r\ntriplicate. It is generally demanded that the law shall be less cumbrous\r\nand more summary. This can be done to some extent when it shall be found\r\nthat the courts favor drainage. So far they have had a very tender\r\nfeeling for complaints. When drainage shall be acknowledged to be\r\nlawful, laudable, and necessary, like plowing, laws may be greatly\r\nsimplified and made more effectual.\r\n\r\nRIVER DISTRICTS.--Illinois being generally level, many of our inland\r\nstreams waste a large amount of land by overflow and drift. Roads,\r\ncrops, and bridges are insecure. To a large extent this may be remedied\r\nby straightening the channels, and hereafter keeping them in repair and\r\nclear of drift wood. If the lands along these rivers, which would\r\nreceive benefits from this work, were made into a district and\r\nclassified according to benefits, the burden on them for proper\r\nimprovement would not be great, and it is believed that dollars would be\r\nrealized for cents expended. This waste is growing worse year by year.\r\nEnough land could be reclaimed along the Kaskaskia, Little Wabash, Big\r\nMuddy, Saline, and Henderson to more than make a New England State. The\r\nState may well afford to do the engineering and give an enabling act,\r\nthat the people interested may organize as they decide to improve their\r\nrespective rivers. When so improved, it will become practicable to more\r\neffectually drain the district by lateral works.\r\n\r\nIllinois being so generally level, and much of our black soil resting on\r\nclay, here is to be the favorite field for the ditcher and tile-maker.\r\nInvention has an inviting field, and already foreshadows rich results.\r\nYour association, though a private one, touches the public interest very\r\nbroadly. You reveal and make possible new sources of wealth, which\r\npromises to agriculture a new era of development. You may do much to\r\nsettle true principles and proper public policy, so that this great\r\ndrainage enterprise may move along harmoniously. The law-maker and the\r\ntile-maker are necessary factors in this grand march of improvement.\r\n\r\nOther valuable papers were read which we shall take occasion to publish\r\nat some future time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER MANAGEMENT NEEDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little forethought on a farm is a good thing. It saves time, money,\r\nand much of the vexation that is liable to come without it. Like the\r\nwatchman on a ship a good farmer must always be looking ahead. He must\r\nbe quick in his judgment of what should be done at the present time, and\r\nhe should have a good perception to show him the best thing to do for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistaken idea that many possess who think there is no brain work\r\nneeded on a farm. Farmers are usually looked upon as an ignorant class\r\nof people, especially by many of the city friends who often do not see\r\nthe large, sympathizing feelings that lie hidden beneath the rough\r\nexterior of country people. They are in many cases better educated than\r\nthey look to be, and they have a chance to use all the education they\r\nhave at their command in the performance of the many and different kinds\r\nof duties that are to be done in the occupation of agriculture. There is\r\nmuch work to be done and it requires to be done at the right time to\r\ngive a profitable return for the labor. To have things done properly a\r\nfarm requires a good manager to eke out the labor force in the way it\r\nwill do the greatest amount of work. Most farmers are willing to work,\r\nand take pleasure in doing so. All perform the harder parts of farming\r\nwith an energy that is surpassed by no other laboring class in the\r\nworld. Farmers deserve praise for this, I think, for it requires a great\r\ndeal of pluck to work as hard as many of them do.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the actual hard manual labor that pays the best. The\r\nhardest part of the work may be done and there still remain enough to\r\nrender the job far from complete. The minute parts of an occupation are\r\nthe ones that distinguish it from others. These parts constitute trades.\r\nThey require a special training to perform them, and the more perfectly\r\nthey can be performed by any one, the more successful will that person\r\nbe considered as a tradesman. A fine workman receives more pay for less\r\nwork than one who does rougher work, simply because it is the minute\r\nparts that bring in the profit. This is so in the mechanical trades; it\r\nis so also in farming and yet many seem to be unaware of the fact. How\r\nnumerous are those who leave out the minutia; mechanics learn a trade in\r\na short time at least well enough to make a living by it. Many farmers\r\nhave spent their whole lives upon farms and are still scarcely able to\r\nmake a decent living; and the reason of it is because they have left\r\nundone those parts which would, if performed, bring in profit.\r\n\r\nIt is not the lack of an education that causes so much poor success. It\r\nis a lack of care in action and a want of observation in seeing. A man's\r\nexperience is what makes him wise. He gains this experience by coming in\r\ncontact with and observing those things which he meets.\r\n\r\nIn schools children are taught from the works of men. These works are\r\narts, and since art is but the imitation of nature, all education is but\r\nimitation of that which the farmer boy has the chance of seeing before\r\nit becomes second hand. There is no place that has greater facilities to\r\ngive observation its full scope than a farm. All farmers can, with the\r\naid of the right kind of books and papers, be reasonably well educated,\r\nand most of them have a better comparative knowledge than they think\r\nthey have. Many of the city cousins are superficially educated. City\r\npeople can talk, but the greater part of the talk of many of them might\r\nbe more properly called chattering. No farmer need feel below them\r\nbecause he is more retired and has a greater amount of modesty.\r\n\r\nIt is true, perhaps, that one can not seem more insignificant than he\r\nreally is. Great men are constantly dying, but the living move on just\r\nthe same. Each person's position seems valuable to few, and yet there is\r\nalmost an entire dependence of man to man. Every one can not fill the\r\nhighest positions, but they should make the best possible use of the\r\nfaculties that are given them. If this is done there will be no regrets\r\nin the future in regard to what might have been done in the past. Life\r\nwill then be thought worth living and much more happiness will cluster\r\naround it than now does.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater lack of education, perhaps, in agriculture than in\r\nthe other vocations of man, and most farmers have a good share of well\r\ndeveloped muscle to aid them in their work. The requisites are supplied.\r\nHow many use them, at least in the way they should be used. All of the\r\nwork could be done, but there is too small a number of good managers to\r\noversee and carry out the performance of the little jobs that require to\r\nbe performed at the right time.\r\n\r\nThere are some people in every business who, in the race for success,\r\nfar outrun their competitors. This may be noticed on a farm. It takes\r\nbut a short time to tell by the work a man does whether he is a good\r\nfarmer or not. If a person is a good farmer and unites that quality to\r\nthat of business management he will be successful in his attainments.\r\nThrough success he will be honored by the members of his profession. He\r\nwill be praised by all other people, and above all he will in the silent\r\nthoughts of his own mind have the satisfaction and pleasure of knowing\r\nthat he is not a cipher in the vast human family. He will be pointed out\r\nas an example to those who are perhaps bowed down by discouragement. He\r\nwill in all probability be called lucky when his success is really due\r\nto decisions that are arrived at by the experience and close observation\r\nof the past. If more farmers would be content to give their thoughts, as\r\nwell as time, to farming, there would be more success and happiness in\r\nthe occupation that depends above all others on good management.\r\n\r\n    S. LAWRENCE.\r\n        QUINCY, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED CORN FROM SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am an interested reader of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, and knowing that\r\nthousands of farmers take the advice they get from its pages and act\r\nupon it, I wish to say that the suggestions of B. F. J., Champaign,\r\nIll., regarding seed corn from portions of the country South of us will\r\nnot do. Last spring hundreds of farmers in Western Iowa planted seed\r\ncorn that came from Kansas and Nebraska, and the result was that none of\r\nthat from Kansas ripened, while but little of the Nebraska seed did any\r\nbetter. It all grew nicely, but was still green and growing when the\r\nfrost came. It may be claimed that much of that grown from native seed\r\nwas no better, but it was better and considerable of it ripened, and\r\nfrom this native seed we have the only promise of seed for next year's\r\nplanting. If farmers expect a good crop of corn they should not get seed\r\nfrom a southern latitude. No Iowa farmer would buy seed corn now that\r\ngrew in Kentucky, Kansas, or Missouri. The only seed corn on which our\r\nfarmers rely implicitly is that which they have gathered before frost\r\ncame and hung up near the fire to be thoroughly dried before it froze.\r\nThat corn will grow.\r\n\r\n    S. L. W.\r\n        MANNING, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD AND FURROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll manures deposited by nature are left on or near the surface. The\r\nwhole tendency of manure is to go down into the soil rather than to rise\r\nfrom it. There is probably very little if any loss of nitrogen from\r\nevaporation of manure, unless it is put in piles so as to foment. Rains\r\nand dews return to the soil as much ammonia in a year as is carried off\r\nin the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nRice contains more starch than either wheat, rye, barley, oats or corn.\r\nOf these grains oats carry the least starch, but by far the largest\r\nproportion of cellulose. In nitrogenous substances wheat leads, followed\r\nby barley, oats, rye and corn, while rice is most deficient. Corn leads\r\nin fat, and oats in relative proportion of water. Wheat leads in gum and\r\nrice in salt.\r\n\r\nConvenience of farm buildings is an important aid to good farming,\r\nespecially where much stock is kept and there are many chores. Water\r\nshould always be provided in the barn-yard, the feeding boxes should be\r\nnear where the feed is kept, and the buildings should not be very far\r\nremoved from the house. If this results in more neatness about barns and\r\nbarnyards than has been thought necessary, it will be another important\r\nadvantage gained.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Elmira Farmers' Club tells the Husbandman that his\r\ncrop of sorghum got caught by the frost, and too much injured to be of\r\nvalue as a sirup-producing substance. But he fed it to his cows which\r\nate it greedily, and soon began to gain in milk. He thinks he got about\r\nas much profit from the crop as if it had been devoted to the original\r\nintent.\r\n\r\nGovernor Glick, in a short address before the State Board of\r\nAgriculture, last week, stated that Kansas history is the most\r\nremarkable on record; that in 1883 her people had more money to the head\r\nthan any other people under heaven; that the State had received 60,000\r\nimmigrant population in 1883; that it will receive 160,000 in 1884; that\r\nin ten years it will have 2,000,000 people, and that thereafter Kansas\r\nwill not care anything about bureaus of immigration--it will have people\r\nenough to work with, and the rest will come as fast as they are needed.\r\n\r\nFarmers' Call: The experiments conducted during the last season at the\r\nMissouri State Agricultural College fully demonstrate the advisability\r\nof mulching potatoes. We believe every experiment so far reported gave a\r\nsimilar result. The cost of the materials for mulching is usually very\r\nsmall, leaves or straw being plentiful and cheap upon the farm. The\r\nmaterials manure the ground; and mulching saves hoeing. The potato\r\nrequires a cooler climate and moister soil than our latitude affords.\r\nMulching tends to secure both. The result in every case has been largely\r\nincreased yields of superior quality.\r\n\r\nThe old saying, no grass no cattle, no cattle no manure, no manure no\r\ncrops, is as true to-day as when first spoken. Grass takes care of him\r\nwho sows it. The meadow is the master mine of wealth. Strong meadows\r\nfill big barns. Fat pastures make fat pockets. The acre that will carry\r\na steer carries wealth. Flush pastures make fat stock. Heavy meadows\r\nmake happy farmers. Up to my ears in soft grass laughs the fat ox. Sweet\r\npastures make sound butter. Soft hay makes strong wool. These are some\r\nof the maxims of the meadow. The grass seed to sow depends upon the soil\r\nand here every man must be his own judge. Not every farmer, however,\r\nknows the grass adapted to his soil. If he does and seeds by the bushel,\r\nor other measures, he is apt to be misled.\r\n\r\nIncluding millet and Hungarian there were in Kansas this year 3,730,150\r\nacres of land devoted to the raising of hay. The yield per acre was 1.61\r\ntons, or a total product of 6,002,576 tons. None of the tame grasses\r\nhave as yet attained a large area in this State, the most extensively\r\ngrown being timothy which has an area of 95,844 acres. The great bulk of\r\nthe grass lands mentioned above is the prairie, protected by fence. The\r\neastern third of the State probably contains four fifths of the tame\r\ngrass area. The question of the growing of tame grasses in Kansas is\r\nreceiving much attention from farmers, it becoming of vast importance as\r\npeople increase the number of their farm animals. The question no doubt\r\nwill be satisfactorily solved within a few years, and the tame grass\r\narea will increase to its just proportion.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural changes in Great Britain continue to be of a marked\r\ncharacter. The area devoted to grain crops the past year was 8,618,675\r\nacres, which is 214,705 acres less than in 1882. Potatoes were planted\r\non 543,000 acres, and turnips and Swedes on 2,029,000 acres--all\r\nshowing a slight increase; but mangolds, vetches and other green crops\r\nhave declined by 21,000 acres on the figures for the previous year.\r\nClover and the grasses show an increase of 58,500 acres. The change from\r\ntilth to permanent pasturage is again conspicuous, there being\r\n15,065,300 acres as compared with 14,821,600 last year. Ten years ago\r\ngrass covered 13,000,000 acres, while arable land has fallen during that\r\nperiod from 18,186,000 to 17,319,000 acres. Orchards are on the\r\nincrease, and also market gardening. In the matter of live stock there\r\nis an improvement which leads to the hope that the heavy losses of\r\nrecent years will be made up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIllinois Central Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe elegant equipment of coaches and sleepers being added to its various\r\nthrough routes is gaining it many friends.

Arrests are becoming frequent, and it seems likely the gang\r\nwill soon be broken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERD BOOKS AND RECORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following addresses may be of use to many readers of THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER who may wish to record stock or purchase books:\r\n\r\nAmerican Short-horn Herd Book--W.

This was a slight\r\nerror. The change was made with reference to the Fat Stock Show. In this\r\nconnection we present the argument of Hon. John P. Reynolds, on the\r\nsubject before the board and which governed the board in its action.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n_To the State Board of Agriculture._\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN.--The undersigned, Superintendent of class A., respectfully\r\nsubmits the following report for the past year, including the fair in\r\nSeptember, and the Fat Stock Show in November.\r\n\r\nTHE FAIR.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly apparent to any one familiar with the displays of\r\nprevious years in this department, that the breeding of fine cattle in\r\nthis country is, at the present time, attracting the attention and\r\ncommanding the best and most intelligent care of not alone the farmers\r\nwho have been bred to their avocation, but of capitalists, who\r\ncomprehend the great money values involved, and who either of themselves\r\nor through their sons have set out to identify themselves with this\r\ngreat interest. As the result of the fact the display of cattle was more\r\nvaried as to breeds and greater as to number, if not superior as to\r\nquality, than at any fair, while the visitors in attendance seeking to\r\npurchase and studying the question of breeds with a view to purchase for\r\nbreeding purposes, were never so numerous nor so much in earnest.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, it may easily be imagined that the awards of\r\nprizes, not for the money value of the prizes themselves, but for the\r\nbearing of such honors upon the interests of exhibitors in regard to\r\nsales, assumed an unusual importance and involved a corresponding\r\nresponsibility on the part of this board. Impressed, as I think, with a\r\nproper sense of that responsibility, and of the embarrassment which\r\nalways surround that position, as your representative I discharged the\r\nduty to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nThe most serious and perhaps, the only embarrassment which I should\r\nrefer to in this report, was the absence of so large a proportion of the\r\nmembers of awarding committees originally selected, rendering it\r\nnecessary to fill the places of the absentees by selections from the\r\nby-standers after the cattle had been called to the rings. Some of you\r\n\"have been there\" and have a realizing sense of the difficulties\r\ninvolved in the effort to make these substitutions intelligently and\r\nwith conscientious care, on the spur of the moment. To do so in all\r\ncases with satisfaction to one's self is simply impossible, and to do it\r\nin all cases with satisfaction to unlucky competing exhibitors is not to\r\nbe expected. If I could do the first and feel sure that the talisman had\r\nbeen wisely selected, it would be easy to disregard complaints, if any,\r\nwhich are known to be unjust.\r\n\r\nThe question of so modifying our committee system as to avoid the\r\nembarrassment I have referred to and thus to secure a better deserved\r\nconfidence in the justice of the awards is one I hope to hear discussed\r\nat this meeting as it has been probably at every meeting of our\r\npredecessors for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nPossibly we are in the light of our own experience, with a different\r\nsystem at the Fat Stock Shows prepared to try something else at the\r\nfairs; but of this I do not feel certain.\r\n\r\nTHE FAT STOCK SHOW.\r\n\r\nThe remarks I have made in regard to the display at the fair and the\r\ngreat interest it excited apply with, if possible, still greater force\r\nto the Fat Stock Show. Your record shows all material facts in respect\r\nto numbers and quality of the stock on exhibition, and I need not\r\nenlarge.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this enterprise, in its relation to the meat supply of\r\nthe world, can hardly be over-stated, and its direct results to the\r\nproducers of the meat producing breeds of stock as well as to the\r\nconsumers, are too apparent to require discussion.\r\n\r\nThe rules and methods adopted by the board for conducting this show\r\nseems to need but little change--some slight modifications of the\r\nrequirements of the premium list will be proposed when that subject\r\nshall come up for consideration, but beyond these there is but one\r\nsubject which I regard as of sufficient importance to demand a\r\nsuggestion from me at this time. I refer to the number of and division\r\nof duties among the awarding committees.\r\n\r\nThe method of selecting judges seems to me all right and there was much\r\nless difficulty in securing their attendance than at the fair. A few did\r\nnot respond, but their places were filled satisfactorily in most cases.\r\nThe wisdom of the appointment of your committee to decide upon the age\r\nof all animals on exhibition, prior to the commencement of the work of\r\nthe judges and entirely independent of any suggestion or wish on the\r\npart of exhibitors, was practically demonstrated so that there is\r\nprobably now no desire to discontinue it. In this case their discussions\r\ncorroborated and established the statements and good faith of the\r\nexhibitors themselves in every instance except one, in which one the\r\nresult was unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe special feature to which I desire to call your attention may perhaps\r\nbe best understood if I express my own views in regard to it.\r\n\r\nAt present it is the practice for one committee of judges to make the\r\nawards on the animals of each breed in their several rings of yearlings,\r\ntwo-year-olds, and three-year-olds. After that has been done it is the\r\npractice for another committee to select the sweepstakes animals from\r\namong all the entries of all ages of that breed without regard to the\r\nprizes which the former committee may have awarded.\r\n\r\nNow it not infrequently happens, and is always liable to occur, that the\r\nlatter committee selects as the best animal of any age one which the\r\nformer committee did not deem worthy of any prize at all or at least not\r\na first prize, when judged by them in competition with these of its own\r\nage only. Evidently there is a mistake somewhere. Both decisions can not\r\nbe correct. Both committees, we are bound to assume are equally honest,\r\ndisinterested, and competent, because the members of both committees\r\nconsidered in making up a decision such discrepancy of judgment and the\r\nsystem which renders it possible may be almost excusable, perhaps, but\r\nin the Fat Stock Show, where we deal so fully in details and exact\r\nfigures, and where we pretend to use our best efforts in every practical\r\nmanner to get at and publish for the benefit of a confiding world the\r\nreliable, bottom facts obtained by the labors of paid experts, reach a\r\nconflicting record is not, in any judgement, one to be greatly proud of.\r\n\r\nThere is one plain, just and proper remedy for this, to wit: Restrict\r\nthe award of sweepstakes prizes in the several breed rings to such\r\nanimals as have taken first premiums in the rings for ages, and restrict\r\ncompetition for _grand sweepstakes_ to such animals as have taken\r\n_sweepstake_ prizes in the breed rings as have not otherwise competed at\r\nall. The awards of all special prizes should follow the decisions in the\r\nregular rings when not offered for animals not included in the regular\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nUnder this rule every animal competing for a sweepstakes prize, with\r\npossible exceptions in the grand sweepstakes, would have received the\r\nhighest indorsement of the committees, and hence there could be no\r\npretense of prejudice on the part of the judges and hence, too, it would\r\nmatter very little whether a new competent committee were called for the\r\ngrand sweepstakes or that committee was composed of judges who served in\r\nthe rings, the latter, in my opinion, being preferable, because of their\r\nlarger opportunity in becoming familiar with the points of difference\r\nbetween the competing animals.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that no objection to the remedy as I have stated it,\r\nwould or could properly be made except by those whose animals were not\r\nincluded in the first prize or sweepstakes winners, and the only\r\nobjection I have ever heard to the adoption of the rule, even at the\r\nfairs, is based on the idea that those animals (or the owners) failing\r\nto take prizes in the rings for ages, should have a \"new trial\" before\r\nan entirely new jury in sweepstakes. But how about those who won the\r\nverdict in the first trial! Is there any justice in requiring them to\r\nsubmit to another trial between themselves and those they have once\r\nvanquished? and if there is any propriety in that, why not in still\r\nanother new trial and more new trials before new juries until every\r\nanimal in the show has received a first prize, or the treasury has been\r\nexhausted or the community fails to furnish any more jurymen?\r\n\r\nIf it were simply the \"consolation stakes\" to non-prize winners, some\r\nloose practice might seem justifiable, but it is not the best policy in\r\nconducting the competitions of the Fat Stock Show to be influenced by\r\nany considerations except those which relate to fair, impartial and\r\nintelligent decisions, and no decisions can be fair, impartial and\r\nintelligent which conflict with each other and which, as a whole, fail\r\nto form a consistent record.\r\n\r\nJOHN P. REYNOLDS,\r\n    Supt. Class A.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJames F. Scott purchased 200 mares and 500 one and two year old colts to\r\nbe delivered on the 15th of March at the San Antonio Viego ranch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING YOUNG MULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere land is not too high, and pasturage good as well as cheap, keeping\r\ngood mares from which young mules can be raised is certainly a\r\nprofitable business; especially so where corn and hay are grown on the\r\nfarm, and the mares can be profitably worked at least part of the year.\r\n\r\nWith a liberal supply of corn fodder for winter feeding, and a good\r\npasture, with hay and corn during the coldest weather, and when at work,\r\nthis branch of farming is not only easy, but certain and profitable. A\r\nmare in good condition, not counting pasturage, can be kept for eight\r\ndollars a year. Service of jack here is generally six dollars, making\r\nkeeping of mare and service cost fourteen. There has been no time since\r\nI came to this part of the State when a mule colt would not bring all\r\nthe way from twenty-five to fifty dollars, depending, of course, upon\r\nthe size, form, and general condition at weaning time. Allowing nothing\r\nfor the work the mare would be able to do, which certainly ought to be\r\nsufficient to pay for her keep, there is left a good margin for profit.\r\nOr if we count the interest on the money invested in the mare, still we\r\nhave a good profit left. The difference paid for young mules shows two\r\nfacts: first, the importance of a good sire, or jack, and the other of a\r\nwell-formed mare. It certainly costs no more money to keep a well-formed\r\nanimal than it does to keep a poor one. Of course, at the start, one may\r\nrequire a somewhat larger outlay of money, and in this way, if we count\r\nthe interest on the money invested, cause young mules to cost a trifle\r\nmore than if cheaper animals were used. But this is more than\r\ncompensated for by the larger price the colt will bring.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a mare that will bring a mule that only sells for\r\nthe lowest price here at weaning time, twenty-five dollars, and one that\r\nbrings a mule that will sell for fifty, the highest generally obtained,\r\nwould make quite an item in the amount of profit to be derived from her\r\nkeep, and especially where the same animals are kept quite a number of\r\nyears for this purpose, as is often the case.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not all; the mule will himself pay handsomely for keeping.\r\nMules a year old, that are broken to the halter, so that they can be\r\nled, bring from eighty to one hundred dollars. When two years old, and\r\nbroken to to the wagon as well as saddle, one hundred to one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five dollars is the general price. Of course a pair of well\r\nmatched mules, well broken to harness, at three or four years, will sell\r\nall the way from three to five hundred dollars, depending upon their\r\ncolor, form, size, etc. And this difference is, in nearly all cases the\r\nresult of the difference between good and poor jacks, as well as good\r\nand poor mares. One other point must always be taken into account in\r\nthis work, and that is in having mares that are sure breeders.\r\n\r\nI find that those who have made most money out of this line of farming\r\nor stock-raising are those who, when they have secured a valuable brood\r\nmare that is sure of bringing a first-class mule colt, they not only\r\nkeep her, but they take good care of her; and in this way they secure\r\nthe very best results and realize the largest profits.\r\n\r\nWhere proper care is taken not to overwork or strain them, mares can\r\nalways be profitably worked in planting and cultivating the corn crop,\r\nas well as cribbing it in the fall; fully enough work can be done to pay\r\nfor what they eat and the pasturage. So that the cost of service and\r\ninterest on the money invested is what the mule costs at weaning time.\r\nAfter that time, of course, they cost something more, as weaning time\r\ngenerally comes in the fall at about the time that pastures fail, and\r\ncorn fodder, wheat straw, and hay, with a small amount of grain during\r\nthe winter must be fed to keep the colt growing in good condition. Many\r\nfarmers who do not care to go to the trouble of breaking young mules,\r\ndispose of them at weaning time; while others find it profitable to buy\r\nthese up at whatever prices they are obtainable, and keep until they are\r\ntwo or three years old; during this time they are broken to lead, to\r\nride, and to work.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there is some risk connected with this, but, on the whole,\r\nit is considered very remunerative--so much so that many young men who\r\nmanage to get enough cash ahead will buy one or two mule colts in the\r\nfall at weaning time and keep them until well broken in, and they sell\r\nat a profit, and in this way make a good start for themselves. As\r\ncompared with other branches of stock-raising, there is less risk in\r\nthis than in almost any other branch of farm stock.\r\n\r\n    N. J.

It was largely attended by the most prominent and\r\nexperienced dairymen of this wonderful dairy State.\r\n\r\nThe people of Lake Mills did their utmost to make the visit of delegates\r\npleasant, and they succeeded admirably. The crowning feature of their\r\nhospitality was the banquet on Thursday night. The feast was prepared by\r\nthe ladies of the M. E. church. The supper, the toasts and responses,\r\nthe music and all were enjoyable in the highest degree. Wisconsin\r\ndairymen believe in banquets. A leading member of the convention\r\ndeclared that the prosperous history of the association began with its\r\nfirst banquet.\r\n\r\nGovernor Rusk was in attendance at this convention, and his address was\r\none calculated to encourage and help on the association. He assured the\r\nmembers that if they thought the association needed legislative aid, all\r\nthey have to do is to ask for it. If they ask for $5,000, he will do his\r\nbest to have the appropriation bill passed, and he will sign the\r\nenactment promptly when it reaches him for signature. He believes\r\nWisconsin one of the foremost of dairy States, and he wants it to retain\r\nits position.\r\n\r\nAmong other prominent gentlemen present who participated in the\r\ndiscussions were Prof. Henry, of the Agricultural Department of the\r\nState University; Hon. Clinton Babbitt, Secretary of the State\r\nAgricultural Society; Hon. Hiram Smith, Chester Hazen, S. Favile, J. M.\r\nSmith, J. H. Smith, J. B. Harris, Inspector of Dairy Factories, Canada,\r\nand T. D. Curtis, Syracuse, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe election of officers resulted in retaining the incumbents of last\r\nyear for another year's service. These gentlemen are: W. H. Morrison,\r\nElkhorn, President; D. W. Curtis, Fort Atkinson, Secretary; H. K.\r\nLoomis, Treasurer.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent papers read was on Co-operative Dairying, by J. B.\r\nHarris, Esq., of Antwerp, N. Y., who is employed by the Canadian\r\ngovernment as inspector of cheese and butter factories. We will give it\r\nin full, and follow next week with some account of the discussions.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATIVE CHEESE-MAKING.\r\n\r\n    In all human efforts, grand results have been attained chiefly\r\n    by concert of action.\r\n\r\n    In our own time, everything is done by co-operation. Railways\r\n    across continents, canals uniting oceans and seas, bridges\r\n    almost of fabulous proportions, enterprises in engineering and\r\n    commerce, never before known, evince the extent to which modern\r\n    genius is availing itself of concert of effort in testing human\r\n    capacity.\r\n\r\n    There is a visible tendency in all branches of business toward\r\n    co-operation and centralization.\r\n\r\n    In looking down upon a large city, the unity visible even in the\r\n    diversity of human affairs manifests itself in a manner truly\r\n    wonderful. The air is literally filled with a vast net-work of\r\n    wire, crossing and re-crossing in every conceivable direction,\r\n    and over these, backward and forward, the thoughts of men are\r\n    made to vibrate with the speed of lightning, in the elaboration\r\n    and consummation of thousands of business schemes, and the air,\r\n    as well as the buildings and streets, is full of human activity\r\n    and enterprise. The lawyer, sitting comfortably at his desk in\r\n    his office, talks with his banker, physician, grocer, a hundred\r\n    clients, and his family, all seated like him himself at home, or\r\n    at their various places of business. Thus is the telephone made\r\n    the instrument of human co-operation and concert of action.\r\n\r\n    It is now less than thirty years since dairymen stumbled into\r\n    the practice of co-operation in the business of making-cheese.\r\n    Previous to that time cheese-making in this country was, to say\r\n    the least, a crude affair. Every farmer ran his own factory,\r\n    according to his own peculiar notion, and disposed of his\r\n    products as he could \"light on\" chaps. In that day,\r\n    cheese-making was guess work and hap-hazard. To-day it is a\r\n    science. Then there were as many rules and methods as there were\r\n    men. To-day the laws which nature has enacted, to govern the\r\n    process of converting milk into cheese, are codified, and\r\n    cheese-making has become a profession. In that day the\r\n    accumulated results of the cheese industry of a neighborhood or\r\n    township was a sight to behold--all manner of circular blocks,\r\n    of concentrated error, large and small, thick and thin, when\r\n    heaped together presented a spectacle that would now bring a\r\n    smile upon the countenance of the most sober and dignified\r\n    cheese-maker in the State.\r\n\r\n    The condition of the market at that time was quite as crude and\r\n    irregular as the system, or rather the want of system, in\r\n    manufacturing. There was no cable, no regular reports from the\r\n    great business centers of the land, no regularly organized\r\n    boards of trade, railroads not as numerous, less daily papers\r\n    were in circulation, and many other circumstances which left the\r\n    seller comparatively at the mercy of the buyer, and the purchase\r\n    and sale of a dairy was conducted upon principles similar to\r\n    those usually practiced in a horse trade.\r\n\r\n    The great changes which since that day have taken place in the\r\n    dairying world are due chiefly to a division of labor, the\r\n    introduction of system and co-operation. Our machinery, we are\r\n    sorry to say, is not yet quite perfect in all its parts, and\r\n    does not move with the precision and harmony of the orchestra,\r\n    to which we have already alluded. Yet, although still in its\r\n    infancy, it has already produced and does annually produce\r\n    results grand indeed.\r\n\r\n    If we take a glance at the various industries at which men are\r\n    to-day engaged, intellectual, commercial, and mechanical, the\r\n    painstaking exactitude everywhere practiced will be found to be\r\n    a growing subject of wonder and admiration. The secret of this\r\n    lies in the fact that perfection in any department of business\r\n    not only enlarges that business but also enriches those engaged\r\n    in it. For example: there are perhaps ten times as many watches\r\n    manufactured in the world to-day as at any other period in its\r\n    history. It is a profitable business, or men would not engage in\r\n    it, and the superhuman effort that is being continually put\r\n    forth to increase the value, by making as perfect an article as\r\n    human power can produce, establishes conclusively the assertion\r\n    that there is always a profit in doing well. I am glad to\r\n    observe that in the cheese industry of the United States and\r\n    Canada, the light of this truth has to some extent aroused the\r\n    slumbering dairymen. To quote from the Utica Herald of Sept. 11,\r\n    1883: \"It is estimated that about 700,000 men are employed in\r\n    this business, in one capacity or another, and that about\r\n    15,000,000 cows are used to furnish the one product of milk. The\r\n    returns from this product are over $800,000,000. The total\r\n    amount of capital invested in dairying in the United States is\r\n    estimated to reach the enormous sum of $2,000,000,000.\" In\r\n    consulting these figures we hope there is no person so dense of\r\n    understanding as to entertain for a moment the idea that had the\r\n    old system of every man his own cheese-maker prevailed that\r\n    anything approaching this grand result would ever have been\r\n    attained. Never. The concert or effort attained in the factory\r\n    system is the key note to this grand, soul-inspiring chorus.\r\n\r\n    But an experience of twenty-five years in the dairy industry\r\n    leads me to the conclusion that in the music of our business\r\n    there is yet much discord. The dairymen and factorymen fail to\r\n    understand the spirit of the piece we are attempting to perform,\r\n    and fail to catch the idea that individual profit and prosperity\r\n    depend upon the success of the business as a whole. No chain is\r\n    stronger than its weakest link, and so long as there remains a\r\n    slovenly dairyman in the business just so long our system will\r\n    be incomplete and the working of co-operation remain imperfect.\r\n    Perfect concert of effort, unbroken unity of hand with hand, in\r\n    all the various details of the business, reaching down to the\r\n    most unimportant items in the production of milk and the making\r\n    of cheese, will produce in the long run the most profitable and\r\n    permanent results to the individual as well as to the community.\r\n\r\n    \"But,\" say some, \"there is too much of the millennium, too much\r\n    of theory, too much of the unattainable, in all this.\" To such I\r\n    answer that there is much of the millennium, much of theory, and\r\n    much of the unattainable in the Sermon on the Mount, and yet our\r\n    Divine Master preached it, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n    It may perhaps be considered chimerical and theorizing to talk\r\n    of a time when there will be no such persons among dairymen as\r\n    what are known to the cheese-maker as a skimmer or stripper, but\r\n    we hope such a time will come, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n    To what purpose do A., B., and C., and a score of other\r\n    industrious, honest, painstaking fellows, exert themselves to\r\n    collect a model dairy, sparing neither time nor expense in\r\n    providing themselves with perfect sets of improved appurtenances\r\n    for those dairies, from rich, well-watered pastures down to\r\n    good, substantial three-legged milking stools, and labor\r\n    incessantly from sunrise until sundown, that their barns may be\r\n    in perfect order and everything connected with the business neat\r\n    and clean, in order that their material may come into the hands\r\n    of the manufacturer in a perfect condition--if heedless, lazy,\r\n    shiftless, dishonest, ignorant, good-for-nothing D. keeps about\r\n    him a herd of sick, disconsolated racks-of-bones, to wander over\r\n    his arid and desolate fields in search of food and drink in\r\n    summer, or with backs humped up, hover together for shelter\r\n    under the lea of a wheat-straw stack, their only food in winter,\r\n    and using a kit of dairying tools, the very best article of\r\n    which is an old, water-soaked, dirty wooden pail, drawing his\r\n    whey from the factory in the old, rusty, time-embattled milk\r\n    cans, in which it is allowed to stand until the next milking,\r\n    and which, after an imperfect washing, and refilled and returned\r\n    to the factory, freighted with a compound sufficiently poisoned\r\n    to nullify and undo the best efforts of a hundred A., B., and\r\n    C's. It may be theorizing and visionary to talk of a time when\r\n    the spirit of co-operation shall have driven such fellows out of\r\n    the dairying business, to betake themselves with a pick-ax and\r\n    spade to the ditch, but that such a time may come ought to be\r\n    the earnest prayer of every thorough-going friend of\r\n    co-operation in the land.\r\n\r\n    It may seem like castle building and an unprofitable waste of\r\n    time to indulge in theories and construct plans by which the\r\n    rivalry among factorymen may be kept within a limit sufficiently\r\n    circumscribed to prevent the fear of loss of patronage from\r\n    interfering with, and lowering the standard of, our cheese. It\r\n    is too often the case, nowadays, that factorymen are deterred\r\n    from a full and complete discharge of their duty to themselves,\r\n    their patrons, and the world in general, by a fear, by no means\r\n    groundless, that a bold and upright course with regard to the\r\n    material brought to them will result in a damaging, if not\r\n    entire loss, of their occupation.\r\n\r\n    The unwise extent to which men have gone in the erection of\r\n    cheese factories, has increased competition to an extent\r\n    decidedly prejudicial to the interest of the cheese-consuming\r\n    world. A., having invested his entire capital in the\r\n    construction and equipment of a factory, will be quite likely,\r\n    when B., C., and D. erect factories in his immediate\r\n    neighborhood, to hold his peace when sundry varieties of swill\r\n    milk are offered at his door, instead of speaking out an\r\n    equivocal protest against the insult thus offered to his\r\n    professional pride and sense of decency.\r\n\r\n    To the dairyman naturally given to slovenly and careless habits,\r\n    the restraint to which he might otherwise be subjected is\r\n    practically removed when nearly equi-distant from his place of\r\n    abode there are three or four factories, instead of one, and he\r\n    knows that if rejected at one place, he can without\r\n    inconvenience go to another, and thus it transpires that at five\r\n    factories in every ten there will be found a conspicuous absence\r\n    of thorough and inexorable discriminations which ought always to\r\n    prevail in the receipt of milk for factory purposes.\r\n\r\n    For this abuse there is, in our estimation, a remedy however\r\n    theoretical and visionary it may appear, and that is concert of\r\n    action and co-operation among factorymen. Men in all branches of\r\n    business, nowadays, associate with each other, and form\r\n    themselves into bodies for the purpose of closer union and\r\n    mutual protection, and when this is done for the general good,\r\n    as well as individual advancement, the purpose is laudable and\r\n    universally successful.\r\n\r\n    We know of no business in which the necessity of combination is\r\n    so great as that of cheese-making, and, what, let me ask, could\r\n    be more desirable and praiseworthy than an association of\r\n    cheese-makers, for the purpose of sending the swill milk of the\r\n    country to the hogs, where it belongs, instead of making it up,\r\n    as at present, for human consumption.\r\n\r\n    We have an idea that such an association might be successfully\r\n    formed, and that, when once in effectual operation, it might ask\r\n    the legislative body of its country to enact a law, entitled \"An\r\n    Act for the suppression of swill milk, and for the general good\r\n    of mankind,\" in which it should be provided, among other things,\r\n    that in every case where a dairyman has left a factory on\r\n    account of having had his milk rejected for cause traceable to\r\n    his negligence, that in all such cases, the factory or factory\r\n    company knowingly receiving the milk of such rejected party,\r\n    shall be liable to some appropriate penalty.\r\n\r\n    The extreme sensitiveness of milk in the absorption of taint\r\n    from the atmosphere, or any substance with which it comes in\r\n    contact, ought to be thoroughly understood by all persons\r\n    engaged in handling it, but, we believe, that but few\r\n    comparatively are alive to the true facts of the case. I\r\n    herewith present several paragraphs clipped from journals of\r\n    recent date:\r\n\r\n    \"There are seventy-five cases of typhoid fever in the town of\r\n    Port Jarvis. Dr. McDonald attributes the spread of the disease\r\n    to the use of milk from the farm of Mrs. Thomas Cuddebach, in\r\n    whose family there have been several typhoid cases, holding that\r\n    the milk conveyed the disease germs. Nearly all of the parties\r\n    now sick had used milk from the farm.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A dairyman from Dundee has been apprehended and fined for\r\n    allowing his wife and daughter to milk cows and assist in the\r\n    sale of milk, after they had been engaged in nursing a child\r\n    suffering from scarlet fever. No less than nineteen cases of\r\n    fever, four of which resulted fatally, were traced to this act\r\n    of carelessness.\"\r\n\r\n    With these facts in view, how can it be expected that any amount\r\n    of diligence on the part of a cheese-maker can atone for the\r\n    unpardonable sin committed, day after day, by the heedless and\r\n    unobserving patrons, of leaving a can of freshly drawn milk\r\n    standing all night in an unwholesome barn or yard, until it has\r\n    absorbed a whole family of pestilential odors, and then to carry\r\n    it to the factory to corrupt and poison everything with which it\r\n    comes in contact.\r\n\r\n    Some may suppose it a mere theory to speak of a condition of\r\n    things in which abuses of this character can not be found, but\r\n    during an experience of five years as cheese instructor, in the\r\n    Province of Ontario, during which I superintended the making of\r\n    cheese in about 400 different factories, and during the last\r\n    year inspected the milk from about 65,000 cows, the property of\r\n    about 7,000 dairymen, I occasionally made up vats in which there\r\n    was no discoverable taint and which, I was pretty certain, came\r\n    from the farms of well drilled, well posted dairymen, and, from\r\n    a circumstance of this character, I am led to the conclusion\r\n    that what has been done once can be done again, and I make such\r\n    facts a text upon which I found my plea for more thorough\r\n    co-operation and diligent painstaking in the work of producing\r\n    milk for factory purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There may be times when peculiar atmospheric conditions will\r\n    exert unfavorable influences, and seasons when drought and wet\r\n    weather will produce changes, over which human efforts have no\r\n    control, and for these sufficient allowance must be made. We\r\n    quarrel with the stupidity, shiftlessness, and ignorance of men,\r\n    and not with the providence of God.\r\n\r\n    In this day and age of the world there is no excuse for\r\n    ignorance upon the points to which we have alluded. Wisdom\r\n    uttereth her voice in the streets, and he who will not hear her\r\n    ought to be drummed out of the camp of dairymen. As a rule, a\r\n    common carpenter puts more thought into his business in a month\r\n    than many dairymen do in a year. Indeed, it would be difficult\r\n    to point out a single branch of human industry, of one-half the\r\n    magnitude which the manufacture and sale of cheese has reached,\r\n    carried on in a manner so slipshod and slovenly as dairying.\r\n\r\n    The banker, the columns of whose ledger fail by one cent of\r\n    balancing, spares neither time nor money in searching out and\r\n    correcting the error; the merchant brings to bear upon his\r\n    business a care and insight so unceasing and laborious that his\r\n    locks are soon sprinkled with premature silver; the machinist\r\n    works to plans from which the variation of a thousandth part of\r\n    an inch can not be allowed to pass uncorrected; but the dairyman\r\n    too often stumbles along through his work without thought, or\r\n    employs the little intellect he has in putting in and harvesting\r\n    his crops, leaving the dairy in the meantime to take care of\r\n    itself. There are too many men engaged in dairying who can see\r\n    nothing in the business beyond the factory dividend; men to whom\r\n    filling the milk pail and the can are the Alpha and Omega of\r\n    life. To such men such a thing as an ambition that their county,\r\n    town, or neighborhood shall attain and hold a reputation for\r\n    being the banner cheese district of the State or nation, is as\r\n    thoroughly unknown as the configuration of the bottom of the\r\n    Dead sea.\r\n\r\n    In saying what we have about the patrons of cheese factories,\r\n    and the closer and more thorough co-operation among them, we\r\n    have been actuated by no feelings of unkindness or ill will, nor\r\n    have we arraigned them upon trivial or imaginary charges. The\r\n    indictments we have found against them are all true bills,\r\n    against which too many of them will be unable to sustain the\r\n    plea of not guilty. We have been constrained to our present\r\n    course by an overmastering sense of the importance of greater\r\n    care, deeper thought, and closer union in pushing forward one of\r\n    the greatest industries of the day. I am confident that before\r\n    another step can be taken in advance it must be preluded by a\r\n    correction of the errors which we have feebly attempted to\r\n    portray, all of which lie outside and prior to the factory. As a\r\n    body, cheese-makers can do little better than they are now\r\n    doing, until there is some improvement in the material upon\r\n    which they are called upon to exercise their skill, and the\r\n    practice of crimination and recrimination, the factorymen\r\n    tossing the blame upon the dairymen and the dairymen upon the\r\n    factorymen, which is made use of to conceal the real source of\r\n    our mistakes, will continue to shield him from the eyes of a\r\n    discriminating public until the care and diligence of dairymen\r\n    strip him of this shelter and drive him forward on the march to\r\n    improvement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _from this\r\ndate to January 1, 1885; For $2.00 you get it for one year and a\r\ncopy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nFREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any first-class\r\nweekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVETERINARY\r\n\r\n\r\nImpaction of the Paunch.\r\n\r\nImpaction of the paunch (the first stomach or rumen) in cattle,\r\nsometimes also called grainsick or mawbound, differs from bloating or\r\nhoove, mainly thereby that the distention is more solid than gaseous, it\r\nbeing either with food alone, or with food and gas. Symptomatically it\r\ndiffers also from hoove by the absence of eructation, and by the\r\nhardness of the flanks and the smaller volume of the swelling. It arises\r\nfrom gorging with almost any kind of food, even with grain or with\r\nchaff, at a sudden change of diet; but it is particularly liable to\r\narise from a surfeit of turnips, fresh grass, or any other succulent\r\nfood at the commencement of the season. The instrument called a probang\r\nought to be introduced, either to decide whether the case be one of\r\nhoove or one of mawbound, or to ascertain the degree in which the latter\r\ndisease exists. If the probang bring on a sudden rush of gas, the\r\ndisease is wholly or chiefly hoove; and if it encounter a solid\r\nresistance, the disease mawbound, and exists in a degree of aggravation\r\nproportioned to the nearness of the point at which the resistance is\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nIn mild cases of impaction of the paunch, when the animal does not seem\r\nto suffer much pain, and is not materially fevered, but merely ceases\r\nrumination or chewing of the cud, refuses to eat, and lies long and\r\nindolently in one posture, a dose of oil, or a little forced walking,\r\nare frequently sufficient to effect a cure. In cases which, though on\r\nthe whole mild, are accompanied with a kind of inertia, or with an\r\ninsuperable reluctance to rise or to move about, stimulants, such as\r\nether diluted with alcohol and water, may be required to rouse the\r\npaunch into renewed action; but whenever such remedies are necessary,\r\nthey must be given in cautious doses, and always accompanied with some\r\ngentle purgatives. In very bad cases, when the animal seems sinking\r\nthrough inertness into death, or in which moans, swells at the sides,\r\nbecomes almost as a board in the flanks, appears to suffer great and\r\nincreasing pain, and seems eventually to be overwhelmed with anguish and\r\nto be passing into unconsciousness, it must be promptly decided whether\r\nwe have sufficient time and encouragement to try the effect of\r\nstimulants, purgatives, the stomach pump, and other comparatively gentle\r\nmeasures; and if not, we should, without much delay, cut through the\r\nleft flank into the paunch, and with the hands withdraw the contents.\r\nThe cutting operation itself is attended or followed with little danger;\r\nbut in the extracting of the food, no matter how carefully performed,\r\nsome small portion is liable to drop into the abdominal cavity; and\r\nthis, in consequence of its indigested condition, resists absorption or\r\nexpulsion, undergoes an irritating decomposition, and may very probably\r\noriginate some serious inflammatory disorder. Any animal which has\r\nsuffered a very bad case of impaction of the paunch, ought, immediately\r\nafter complete restoration to health, to be sent to the shambles; for,\r\nindependently of the lurking danger consequent on the artificial\r\nextraction of the food, or even upon the relaxation which follows the\r\nadministration of a stimulant, the paunch is so much overstretched and\r\ninjured by the mechanical effects of the distension as to be temporarily\r\nincapacitated for the proper discharge of its functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueries Answered.\r\n\r\nPROBABLY RINGBONE.--W.

All\r\nthat may be expected from treatment is to retard or stay its progress or\r\ndevelopment; but in all cases more or less stiffness or lameness will\r\nremain, depending upon the extent of its development. Then, subsequent\r\nhard work, or any cause of renewed irritation, will be apt to further\r\naggravate the case, and cause additional enlargement and increasing\r\nlameness. The usual course of treatment in such cases consists in\r\nblistering or firing, or both combined, with subsequent long rest or a\r\nseason's liberty on pasture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUneasiness is a species of sagacity; a passive sagacity.

B. GALUSHA.\r\n\r\nProgress in all arts and sciences is the one grand aim of all\r\nassociations and of all agricultural and horticultural societies and\r\njournals; and to study the results of each year's experiences and\r\nobservations, comparing them with those of previous years, and also with\r\nthe ideal of perfection which each laborer in these several departments\r\nof industry has pictured in his own mind, is the best preparation for\r\nachieving desired results in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the present paper we will take a brief retrospect of the fruit crops\r\nof 1883, and inquire into the causes of successes and failures.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the strawberry, which, though small and unpretentious, has\r\nbeen from year to year rising in importance until it has become second\r\nonly to the apple in the estimation of a majority of consumers.\r\n\r\nThe past year's experience has taught, as does that of each year, that\r\ngreat care should be taken in selecting varieties adapted to each\r\nparticular soil and situation. This may be said to be the important\r\nthing in strawberry growing.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult thing to find such varieties by the ordinary means of\r\nselecting; namely, recourse to the catalogues of growers. Man has a\r\nwonderful amount of selfishness in his composition. I say wonderful, for\r\nit is a wonder when we consider how much better he would enjoy life were\r\nall selfishness eliminated from it, and benevolence, coupled with true\r\nself love, were substituted. \"Each crow thinks its own young the\r\nblackest,\" and each (almost) originator or \"exclusive owner\" of a new\r\nvariety of plant or tree, labors hard to convince himself and others\r\nthat he has the best of his kind; but, owing to the weakness of human\r\nnature, even the sincere among these are liable to be biased, and thus\r\nmislead others. The only safety, therefore, lies in planting such\r\nvarieties as you know to succeed well near you in similar soil, while\r\nnew varieties, commended as superior by persons of known integrity and\r\nexperience, for similar soil and climatic condition, should be tried\r\nonly on a small scale as an experiment. If they succeed, you can soon\r\nhave plenty of plants of your own growing--if you prefer to grow them.\r\nThis advice, though often before given will bear frequent\r\nrepetition--for the desire for \"something new\" is as prevalent with us\r\nnow as it was with the Athenians in St. Paul's time. We have seen Big\r\nBobs, Great Americans, and other monstrosities dwindle to pigmies in the\r\nhands of ordinary cultivators, and the demand for Sharpless become less\r\nsharp through its sensitiveness to the influence of Jack Frost; and\r\nhosts of other sorts, really good and valuable somewhere, and under\r\npeculiarly favorable conditions to be comparatively valueless for\r\ngeneral cultivation. Therefore every person designing to plant should\r\nrepeat to himself this injunction--\"Go slow on new varieties.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable for persons who plant for their own use solely to\r\nselect the pistillate varieties; for these, although the most profusely\r\nproductive when well fertilized, are liable to overrun their staminate\r\nneighbors, and soon render the \"strawberry patch\" unproductive, or\r\nproductive only of small or imperfect fruit. The leading pistillates\r\noffered in the catalogues now are Crescent, Col. Cheney, Windsor Chief,\r\nJersey Queen, Big Bob, Manchester, Green Prolific, Golden Defiance,\r\nChampion, Park Beauty, Gipsey, and some others.\r\n\r\nThere are a few sorts, having perfect blossoms, which give profitable\r\nreturns on a variety of soils, and which may be considered safe to\r\nplant. These are Charles Downing, Miner, Bidwell (kept in single rows or\r\nsingle plants), Piper, Cumberland Triumph, Phelps (\"Old Iron Clad\"),\r\nSucker State, Finch, Capt. Jack (acid), Longfellow (with good, rich\r\nculture), Mt. Vernon (late), and for sandy soil, Kentucky (late). This\r\nlist may be said to constitute the cream of the thousand and one\r\nvarieties offered which have been well tested. Of course those who grow\r\nstrawberries for market will plant largely of some of the pistillate\r\nsorts, owing to their great productiveness.\r\n\r\nThe past year has taught the folly of too great haste in removing the\r\ncovering from strawberry plants; as those which bloomed early were badly\r\ndamaged by the frost. Plantations, also, which were partially screened\r\nby rows and belts of evergreens produced twice to three times the\r\nquantity of fruit that was obtained from the same varieties fully\r\nexposed. Plants in orchards also escaped to a great degree, for the\r\ntrees were in leaf when the destructive frost occurred, and thus gave\r\npartial protection. Strawberries are at home in a young orchard; the\r\ncultivation given the plants is good for the trees, and the slight shade\r\nof the young trees is no perceptible detriment to the plants or fruit.\r\n\r\nThe general crop was about one-third an average--the chief damage being\r\ndone by the frost--though the tarnished plant-bug was very destructive\r\nin Southern Illinois, and did some damage in other localities. Prices\r\nwere from fifty to a hundred per cent higher than usual--supply and\r\ndemand being the factors, in the fruit trade, as well as in all others,\r\nwhich regulate prices.\r\n\r\nSpring is better than summer or autumn for planting strawberries. In\r\nthirty years' experience in strawberry culture I have never, except in\r\ntwo instances, found any advantage in summer or fall planting, and in\r\nthese pot-plants were used, which are too expensive for general planting\r\nand not always preferable. Three or four of the varieties named, 100 of\r\neach, planted as early in spring as the ground is in good condition, in\r\nrows three to three and a half feet apart, and confined, as they run, to\r\nnarrow strips, will give an abundance of fruit for two or three years\r\nfor a large family. Certainly such planting and care is as good an\r\ninvestment as can be made upon any farm or in any garden.\r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES\r\n\r\nwere more nearly a failure, generally, as a crop, in 1883, than\r\nstrawberries, but owing to a different cause, namely, the severe cold of\r\nthe previous winter. None of the cultivated varieties escaped unharmed\r\nwherever the mercury sank lower than 30 degrees below zero, and 32\r\ndegrees below was marked nearly everywhere north of the latitude of\r\nPeoria and Bloomington, in Illinois, and in many places 36 degrees below\r\nwas recorded. Blackberries also suffered; even the hardy Snyder not\r\nescaping; and a similar disaster threatens the crops of these species in\r\n1884, for as I write, on a clear, sunny day, the mercury has not risen\r\nhigher than 16 degrees below zero, and this morning (January 5,) was 33\r\ndegrees below here in Peoria, and 35 degrees below in Bloomington. The\r\ncanes went into the winter in good order, however, and, if no intense\r\ncold prevails hereafter, the damage may be less than last winter when\r\nthey were not as well hardened.\r\n\r\nSince we can not prevent the recurrence of these polar region\r\ndown-pours, we can prepare our canes of raspberries and blackberries for\r\nenduring such extreme cold, by commencing cultivation early in the\r\nspring and discontinuing by the middle of June, also by stopping the\r\ngrowth of young canes, by pinching or chopping off, when not more than\r\ntwo and a half feet high, and again, as soon as another foot in length\r\nis made, stopping both uprights and laterals. If all weak canes are kept\r\ncut out, and those shortened for fruiting the next year not allowed to\r\nstand nearer than eight or ten inches of each other, they will become\r\n\"ripe\" and firm in texture before cold weather overtakes them. The\r\nhardiest of the red varieties are Turner, Thwack, and Cuthbert; and of\r\nthe black-caps, the Soughegan (earliest), Tyler, and Gregg (latest). The\r\nblack-caps named endured the winter fully as well as the hardy red\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nOf blackberries the Snyder still heads the list for hardiness and\r\ngeneral value north of the latitude named, though Early Harvest bids\r\nfair to be of value. Taylor was damaged a little more than Snyder, while\r\nBarnard, Ancient Briton, and Stone's Hardy rank with Snyder for\r\nhardiness.\r\n\r\nRaspberries and blackberries should be planted early in the spring, if\r\nnot done in late autumn, in rows six to eight feet apart. Red\r\nraspberries may be set two feet apart in the rows, and black-caps and\r\nblackberries wider--two and one-half to four feet, according to stock of\r\nplants or desire for quick returns; for all will bear the next year\r\nafter planting. Give good cultivation the first year and mulch in the\r\nfall, along the rows of both raspberries and blackberries, with manure\r\nfree from grass seeds, and cover the entire surface between the rows of\r\nblackberries with old prairie hay, corncobs, or straw; or, if\r\ncultivation the next year is intended, the inter-row of mulch may be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nThe intense cold of these two consecutive winters should not deter land\r\nowners from planting these fruits. These extremes come in cycles; and,\r\nthough old Jupiter is now, and was last winter, exerting an unusual\r\ndisturbing influence upon our planet, he will this year calm his temper\r\nand give us nine or ten years of respite from his powerful magnetic\r\nsway.\r\n\r\nCURRANTS, GOOSEBERRIES, AND GRAPES\r\n\r\nwere less affected by the severity of the winter of '83-'84 than by the\r\nlate frosts of spring, which destroyed the young shoots of grapes and\r\nthe blossoms and young fruit of the berries. Currants are yearly growing\r\nin favor and the price of the fruit advancing; and now currant culture\r\nis profitable and likely to continue so for a series of years.\r\n\r\nGround can not well be made too rich for currants and gooseberries.\r\nPlant in rows four feet apart and plants three feet apart in the rows;\r\ngive thorough culture or deep mulch over the entire surface, cut out all\r\nwood of three years' growth (or after first crop is often considered\r\nbetter), and a good crop is almost certain. Red Dutch, White Grape,\r\nVictoria, and Versailles are still the favorites; and American Seedling\r\n(or Cluster) and Houghton are usually the most profitable gooseberries.\r\n\r\nEvery one who can raise corn and potatoes can as easily raise, with\r\nlittle trouble and expense, grapes enough for a family's use. Plant such\r\nhardy sorts as Moore's Early, Worden, Concord, and Martha, in rows seven\r\nor eight feet apart, and same distance in the row, give good cultivation\r\nthe first year, cut back to two or three feet in autumn, lay the short\r\ncanes on the ground and hold down with a spadeful of earth. Plant posts\r\nfour feet high and stretch two No. 15 wires along them--the upper one on\r\ntop--and in the spring, as the vines grow, tie to the wires, keeping one\r\ncane only for fruit this year and two new ones for next year's fruiting;\r\nand a crop is as certain as a crop of corn. Cut out weak canes every\r\nyear, and encourage those starting nearest the ground, cutting back each\r\nautumn one-half or two-thirds the growth; cut out old canes. It is not\r\nnecessary to lay the canes down and hold them to the ground or cover in\r\nthis latitude, though this work will pay well.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks orchards will be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Executive Board of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety was held in the agricultural rooms at Springfield, January 9th.\r\nPresent: John M. Pearson, Godfrey, President; A. C. Hammond, Warsaw,\r\nSecretary; S. M. Slade, Elgin, Arthur Bryant, Princeton, Dr. A. G.\r\nHumphrey, Galesburg, H. M. Dunlap, Champaign, and E. A. Reihl, Alton.\r\n\r\nA large amount of routine business was transacted, not of public\r\ninterest, after which the board proceeded to arrange for a grand fruit\r\nexhibition, to be made by the society at the next State Fair. This\r\ncollection will not be entered for a premium, but only to show the\r\ndiversified horticultural products of the State.\r\n\r\nThe public-spirited citizens of Illinois, and particularly of Chicago,\r\nhave decreed that the State Fair of 1884 shall eclipse anything of the\r\nkind ever held in the Northwest, and the State Horticultural Society,\r\ndesiring to keep abreast of the times, will make a display of fruit that\r\nthe State may well be proud of.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided to offer liberal premiums for horticultural products\r\nto be exhibited at the next winter meeting, which will be held in the\r\nIndustrial University, at Champaign, the first or second week in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion as to the best method of interesting the students\r\nin our work, it was decided to offer premiums, first and second, for the\r\nbest essays on horticultural subjects. The board and members of the\r\nsociety hope that this offer will be the means of bringing out a number\r\nof papers from the young gentlemen and ladies of the institution.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a determination evinced by the members of the board\r\nand society to make an aggressive, vigorous campaign the present year,\r\nand to bring our work more prominently before the people than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe following are the standing committees for the year:\r\n\r\n    Orchard Culture--B.

Hathaway,\r\n    Damascus.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of ad-interim committees was referred to the members of\r\nthe board from each horticultural district. A portion of them asked time\r\nfor consultation, which was granted. When the entire committee in\r\nappointed, the names will be reported to THE PRAIRIE FARMER.\r\n\r\nA. C. HAMMOND, Sec'y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOGENES IN HIS TUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd first, Diogenes would discourse of that remarkable polar wave that\r\nstruck us on Saturday the 5th of the year, and its probable effect on\r\nthe fruit product. Great fear is manifested on all sides, and not\r\nwithout grounds: yet the conditions, it seems to me, have been so\r\nfavorable that there is cause for hope. Remember that there was no very\r\nsudden change, the temperature having been low for two or three weeks\r\nbefore, and no sudden rise since. The sudden changes seem to be the\r\nones--coming in the midst of winter--that are the most destructive to\r\nour fruits. So I conclude there is ground yet for hope; and unless some\r\nfuture disaster should occur, Dio., if living, will expect to eat of\r\nseveral sorts of fruit this year grown on his own grounds. Keep in good\r\nheart, brethren; Providence will send us all we deserve.\r\n\r\nBut hasn't that man at Cape Girardeau a level head? Dio. himself could\r\nnot have given as many sensible suggestions concerning farmers'\r\nlibraries, as he did in No. 1. All farmers and horticulturists can not\r\ngo as deeply into periodicals as he, but they can profitably go much\r\ndeeper than they do. Take a farmer's home provided on his plan, and then\r\nimagine, if you can, sensible sons running off to breaking on freight\r\ntrains, or selling soap and candies behind counters! Improbable.\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, in No. 2, his thoughts on naming country houses. How\r\nsuggestive!\r\n\r\nThe Editor in No. 1, favors interdiction of French liquors, etc., as\r\nretaliation for their interdiction of American pork. Dio. says interdict\r\nthem as a matter of protection to ourselves, without regard to hog or\r\nhominy.\r\n\r\n\"Man of the Prairie\" was looking out for a little colder weather. Did he\r\nfind it--and is he satisfied?\r\n\r\nAn extremely suggestive paper that, of Prof. Budd's on the \"Cherry\r\nPossibilities.\" Further investigation in the wide field of European\r\nhorticulture is demanded, not only in regard to this but to most other\r\nfruits. Even unpromising sorts, not prized there, transplanted here, may\r\nturn out to be the most valuable of any. I fear the agricultural\r\ncolleges are not taking as much interest in this matter as they ought.\r\nOur State Society ought, and doubtless does, feel thankful to Prof. B.,\r\nfor his presence and wise counsel at its late Bloomington meeting. His\r\nremarks will be found valuable reading in the forth-coming volume of\r\nTransactions.\r\n\r\nSeedsmen's catalogues will soon be floating around thick as autumn\r\nleaves, and planters will be puzzled what to buy. My experience may be\r\nworth something: Of tomatoes, I know nothing better than Acme and\r\nTrophy, and I think favorably of the Golden Trophy--though with some the\r\ncolor is objectionable. The Short-horn carrot can't be beat for table\r\nuse, nor the Egyptian beet. Of the former, planted pretty thick in good\r\nsoil, in rows two feet apart, 400 bushels per acre can easily be grown;\r\nand besides being good for stock, they are mighty good for men and\r\nwomen. In squashes the Hubbard and Boston Marrow are standbys, and that\r\nlittle Perfect Gem is likely to prove A No. 1. And give me the Stowell\r\nEvergreen sweet corn and the Winningstadt cabbage yet all the time. But\r\nDio. will not be fooled with so many new sorts in 1884 as he has been in\r\nformer years.\r\n\r\nYes--increase the tax on dogs, and collect it; so say the Iowa\r\nstock-breeders, and so echoes every sensible friend of the farmer and\r\nhis interests.\r\n\r\nNext time Dio. proposes to call up a subject of much importance to\r\neverybody, and one that badly needs ventilating.\r\n\r\n    DIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES OF CHERRY GROWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insertion of one little word gives too unfavorable an idea of the\r\nbest varieties of the Griotte cherries, grown all over the interminable\r\nsteppes north and east of the Carpathian mountains in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs printed the paragraph reads: \"Some of the thin-twigged Griottes, with\r\ndark skins and colored juice, are as large as the Morello and nearly or\r\nquite as sweet.\"\r\n\r\nThe copy reads--or should read--\"as large as the English Morello and\r\nnearly or quid sweet.\"\r\n\r\nAs you say my object in talking the matter up is the hope of interesting\r\nsome of the large nurserymen, like those at Bloomington, in the\r\ndesirable work of importing and propagating the Griottes, Amarells, and\r\nthe Asiatic sweet cherries known as \"Spanish,\" of the East plain, on a\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nWhy should our Western propagators permit our importing of fruits,\r\nornamental trees and shrubs, to be done by the nurserymen of the Eastern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to a good map of Europe we will see at a glance that the\r\nimporting of fruits so far has been from the west coast of France,\r\nBelgium, and Holland, or from the south of England. As with our west\r\ncoast, this whole region has been made a land of verdure by the soft,\r\nhumid air of the Gulf stream. Tracing on the map the line of the\r\nCarpathian and Caucasus mountains, we find three-fourths of all Europe,\r\nnorth and east of these ranges, without a mountain or hill traced on the\r\ngreat expanse except the Valdai hills, and these are only bluffs not as\r\nhigh or extensive as those of our rivers and dividing ridges. It is the\r\ngreatest plain section of the world, and is the ancient home of the best\r\nfruits of the temperate zones. Common sense should lead us to give trial\r\nto the horticultural products of this plain. To find apples, pears,\r\ncherries, and plums as hardy, and as well adapted to the hot summers and\r\ncold winters of Illinois and Iowa as the Fameuse apple, we need not\r\nenter the empire of Russia. Northeastern Austria has a variable summer\r\nand winter climate, which will not permit the growing of apples of the\r\ngrade of hardiness of the Ben Davis, Stark, Jonathan, and Dominie; of\r\npears of the grade of Flemish Beauty, or of cherries of the grade of\r\nEarly Richmond as to foliage and ability to endure low temperature. The\r\ncommercial nursery-man who will visit the \"King's Pomological\r\nInstitute,\" at Proskau, in North Silesia, will see at a glance, as he\r\nwanders over the ground, that the fruits, forest trees, ornamental trees\r\nand shrubs of the nurseries of England, France, Belgium, etc., suddenly\r\ndisappear with the Carpathians on the edge of the great steppes.\r\n\r\n    J. L. BUDD,\r\n        AG. COLLEGE, AMES, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrunings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil for window boxes is the same as for plant culture in pots; the\r\nbest is that formed by rotted sods with a little well decomposed stable\r\nmanure mixed with it.\r\n\r\nRhubarb requires deep, rich soil. A good dressing of well-rotted manure,\r\nput on the ground this winter when it is not frozen, will start off the\r\nplants briskly in the spring. The same is true for asparagus.\r\n\r\nMr. Russel Heath, Carpenteria, Cal., has an \"English walnut orchard\" of\r\ntwo hundred acres of rich, level land, near the sea-shore. The trees are\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five years planted. His crop in 1882 was 630 sacks of\r\n70 pounds each; this season he expects the harvest will aggregate about\r\none-third more.\r\n\r\nGardener's Monthly: The writer found among the gardeners in Canada, when\r\nin that country recently, that the English plan of preserving grapes in\r\nbottles of water was in not uncommon use. The bunches are cut with\r\npieces of stems, and then so arranged that the ends are in bottles of\r\nwater. By this plan the grapes can be preserved far into the spring\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe American Cultivator: \"Can you tell we what kind of weather we may\r\nexpect next month?\" wrote a farmer to the editor of his paper, and the\r\neditor replied: \"It is my belief that the weather next month will be\r\nlike your subscription bill.\" The farmer wondered for an hour what the\r\neditor was driving at, when he happened to think of the word\r\n\"unsettled,\" and he sent a postal note forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and Fruit Grower: Mr. Willis, Lamer, a prominent fruit grower\r\nof the Cobden region, says he very distinctly remembers that the freeze\r\nof 1864 killed young fruit trees to the snow line, and that he cut his\r\npeach trees to that line, and saved that much. In 1864 the temperature\r\nwas about the same as it was on January 5, 1884--in the neighborhood of\r\n21 degrees below zero. Mr. Lamer thought no damage was done to\r\nstrawberry plants.\r\n\r\nA pomologist gives the following excellent advice in regard to\r\nmaintaining the fertility of fruit lands: \"Encourage the utmost variety\r\nof vegetable growth near and upon your orchard lands, and never rob the\r\nsoil of its honest dues. Give judicious and thorough cultivation and\r\npruning; and with our generous soils and climate, I do not believe the\r\nchild is yet born that will live to see our orchards languish on account\r\nof poverty of soil, or any necessity arise for the importation of\r\nfertilizers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Country Gentleman says two things are necessary for the growing of\r\ngood asparagus, namely, plenty of room for the plant to grow, and\r\ncopious manuring. The latter is best applied to thick beds by covering\r\nthe whole surface with manure two or three inches thick, late in autumn,\r\nand forking it in very early in spring, before the new shoots start.\r\nThick beds, however, should not be planted, but the plants allowed three\r\nor four feet each way to each. Three by five is a common and suitable\r\ndistance, and large stalks may be obtained in this way.\r\n\r\nCharles Merritt, of Battle Creek, has been very successful with\r\nstrawberries. His plan is to plant rows about two and one-half feet\r\napart and plants nine inches in the row; he prefers the spring time. He\r\nmanures highly, cultivates thoroughly and mulches with clean straw late\r\nin the autumn. The next season he gets a large crop, and, while he is\r\ntaking it off, another patch is being treated in a similar manner for\r\nthe next year's crop. The second year with any bed he simply pulls out\r\nthe weeds, and after picking turns it under. This plan proves to be\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nT. F. Leeper, of Warsaw Horticultural Society, says: I have been greatly\r\ninterested in the condition of orchards this season, and have examined\r\nquite a number. One orchard in my neighborhood died during the summer--I\r\nsupposed it was winter-killed, but an investigation showed that the\r\nroots had been destroyed by mice. Last spring I reported a number of\r\ntrees in my orchard, winter-killed. These trees have been dug up and it\r\nappears that they too, were killed by mice. In my orchard the greatest\r\ninjury by winter-killing has occurred in the draws or low places and I\r\nwould not plant another orchard without tile drawing such places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFLORICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nGleanings by an Old Florist.\r\n\r\nTHE PANSY.\r\n\r\nGray, in his Manual, says: \"Viola tricolor (pansy or heart's-ease) is\r\ncommon in dry or sandy soil. From New York to Kentucky and southward,\r\ndoubtless only a small portion of the garden pansy runs wild.\r\nNaturalized from Europe.\"\r\n\r\nSeen in this condition the flowers are very small, not more than\r\none-half an inch across and oblong in shape. Cultivated at its best it\r\nhas a flower two inches in diameter, almost an exact circle in outline.\r\n\r\nAll this has been brought about by lovers of flowers during a long\r\nperiod of years, by saving the seed of only the best, a sort of survival\r\nof the fittest, and only to be kept up by rich soil and constant\r\ncultivation, for if left to itself the pansy dwindles back into its\r\noriginal nature.\r\n\r\nIt has another peculiarity also: the young plants always bring the\r\nlargest flowers, so that if the extra large flowers are wanted they can\r\nbe obtained only by seed annually, or a division of the old roots by\r\ncuttings. The latter is too much trouble for most cultivators in the\r\ncountry, and named kinds are never thought of, while in the old they\r\nused to be; perhaps it is still common for the pansy grower to name his\r\npets, and reproduce them each year by cuttings or division of the roots.\r\n\r\nThe seed that brings the largest and best flowers generally come from\r\nGermany, although some of our own florists save them themselves for\r\nseveral consecutive years. I was a long time before any fixed character\r\nwas maintained in color in this flower, but now seed from certain kinds\r\nwill mainly reproduce its like, hence are often so used for massing\r\nkinds of a color. The plant being a native of the cooler and moister\r\nparts of Europe is better adapted to their climate than ours, and hence\r\nas our spring weather is more nearly like their original climate than\r\nour other seasons, they luxuriate in it; it is the only season in which\r\nthe florist finds much of a market for his goods, and even then he\r\nreceives some round abuse for selling very large noble flowers that\r\nquickly deteriorate after leaving his hands. This, however, is not his\r\nfault, the hot weather being one cause, the other that the plant refuses\r\nto produce large flowers except in its young state.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods adopted by a florist in the preparation of his\r\nstock; one, by sowing the seed in the fall and wintering the young\r\nplants in cold frames, or even by means of a slight protection of brush.\r\nThe other by sowing the seed on a bench in the green-house in January.\r\nIf sown in the fall early enough to get well into rough leaf, if they do\r\nnot flower in the fall, which they usually will do, they are ready to do\r\nso at the first peep of spring, as they flower at a comparatively low\r\ntemperature. If sown in January, they are transplanted once on other\r\nbenches, from which they are lifted and transferred either to the\r\noutside borders or to other cold frames as the case may be. It is not\r\nbest to keep them in a green-house longer than necessary, say the first\r\nof March, as the conditions of a green-house will bring about the small\r\nflowers similar to the hot weather of the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANSY.]\r\n\r\nBy the different systems the market florist can have his goods always at\r\ntheir best during the selling season, which ranges from the first of\r\nMarch up to the first of June. They are so easily grown he can afford to\r\nsell cheap, even if his goods are of the very best, and will usually\r\nbring about seventy-five cents by the single dozen, down to as low as\r\nthree dollars by the hundred. Enough sod should hang to the roots to\r\nkeep them fresh, and they will, after planting, go on flowering just as\r\nthough they had never been disturbed. Nothing can be done with this\r\nplant, at least worthy of the name, in the window, hence it should not\r\nbe attempted. To enjoy the large flowers as long as possible during\r\nsummer, if there is any choice of position, give them the coolest and\r\nmoistest place in the garden, not forgetting plenty of watering in dry\r\nspells. A rich, loamy soil, inclined to be porous, will give the best\r\nsatisfaction, but almost any garden soil will grow them.\r\n\r\nEDGAR SANDERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL FARM DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nWHY, WHEN, and HOW TO TILE-DRAIN\r\n--AND THE--\r\nMANUFACTURE OF DRAIN-TILE.\r\n\r\nBy C.G.

It has kept pace with the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the country, holding its steady course through all these\r\nforty-three years, encouraging, counseling, and educating its thousands\r\nof readers. It has labored earnestly in the interest of all who are\r\nengaged in the rural industries of the country, and that it has labored\r\nsuccessfully is abundantly shown by the prominence and prestige it has\r\nachieved, and the hold it has upon the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nIts managers are conscious from comparison with other journals of its\r\nclass, and from the uniform testimony of its readers, that it is\r\nforemost among the farm and home papers of the country. It will not be\r\npermitted to lose this proud position; we shall spare no efforts to\r\nmaintain its usefulness and make it indispensable to farmers,\r\nstock-raisers, feeders, dairymen, horticulturalists, gardeners, and all\r\nothers engaged in rural pursuits. It will enter upon its forty-fourth\r\nyear under auspices, in every point of view, more encouraging than ever\r\nbefore in its history. Its mission has always been, and will continue to\r\nbe--\r\n\r\nTo discuss the most approved practices in all agricultural and\r\nhorticultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nTo set forth the merits of the best breeds of domestic animals, and to\r\nelucidate the principles of correct breeding and management.\r\n\r\nTo further the work of agricultural and horticultural organization.\r\n\r\nTo advocate industrial education in the correct sense of the term.\r\n\r\nTo lead the van in the great contest of the people against monopolies\r\nand the unjust encroachments of capital.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the events and questions of the day without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nTo provide information concerning the public domain, Western soil,\r\nclimate, water, railroads, schools, churches, and society.\r\n\r\nTo answer inquiries on all manner of subjects coming within its sphere.\r\n\r\nTo furnish the latest and most important industrial news at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTo give full and reliable crop, weather, and market reports.\r\n\r\nTo present the family with pure, choice, and interesting literature.\r\n\r\nTo amuse and instruct the young folks.\r\n\r\nTo gather and condense the general news of the day.\r\n\r\nTo be, in brief, an indispensable and unexceptionable farm and home\r\ncompanion for the people of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe style and form of the paper are now exactly what they should be. The\r\npaper used is of superior quality. The type is bold and clear. The\r\nillustrations are superb. The departments are varied and carefully\r\narranged. The editorial force is large and capable. The list of\r\ncontributors is greatly increased, and embraces a stronger array of\r\ntalent than is employed on any similar paper in this country. We\r\nchallenge comparison with any agricultural journal in the land.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is designed for all sections of the country. In\r\nentering upon the campaign of 1884, we urge all patrons and friends to\r\ncontinue their good works in extending the circulation of our paper. On\r\nour part we promise to leave nothing undone that it is possible for\r\nfaithful, earnest work--aided by money and every needed mechanical\r\nfacility--to do to make the paper in every respect still better than it\r\nhas ever been before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTICE\r\n\r\nTo each Subscriber who will remit us $2.00 between now and February 1st,\r\n1884, we will mail a copy of THE PRAIRIE FARMER FOR ONE YEAR, AND ONE OF\r\nOUR NEW STANDARD TIME COMMERCIAL MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES AND\r\nCANADA--showing all the Counties, Railroads, and Principal Towns up to\r\ndate.

The total\r\nvalue of declared exports from the various United States consular\r\ndistricts in Great Britain and Ireland during the year was $165,207,987,\r\na reduction from the figures for the preceding year of $14,231,858.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Calkins, member of Congress from Indiana, succeeded on Monday in\r\ngetting a suspension of the rules and the passage of a bill providing\r\nthat in any suit against an innocent purchaser of an article\r\nmanufactured in violation of the patent law, if the plaintiff shall not\r\nrecover twenty dollars or over, he shall recover no costs. This bill is\r\na blow aimed at the drive-well patent agents, and others of that ilk who\r\nare perambulating the country to the annoyance of farmers. If the bill\r\npasses the Senate, and there appears no valid reason why it shall not,\r\nit will put an end to this species of robbery now so prevalent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only general advices we have regarding winter wheat come through the\r\nextensive grain commission house of W. T. Baker & Co., Chicago. They\r\nhave private reports which indicate that the crop maintains a very high\r\naverage, and, with the exception of a few points in Southern Illinois,\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee, is doing as well as could be expected at this\r\nseason of the year. In Kentucky and Tennessee the ground is quite bare\r\nof snow, but north of the Ohio river, from Kansas to Ohio, the wheat, as\r\na general thing, is well covered. The crop, however, was generally sown\r\nlate, and in many quarters fears are entertained of the final outcome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska State Farmers' Alliance held a meeting at Kearney on\r\nWednesday of last week.

The topics discussed will be:\r\n_Soils_--Their Origin, Physical Characteristics, Chemical Composition,\r\nDrainage, Cultivation, Fertilization; _Plants_--Their Structure, Growth,\r\nNutrition, Seeds, Movement of Sap, Development and Distribution,\r\nEconomic Products. Addresses will be given in the evenings by Dr.\r\nPeabody, Governor Hamilton and others.

All interested are\r\ncordially invited to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF COLD WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Shelton, of the Kansas Agricultural College, puts the question of\r\nsheltering stock in an exceedingly pointed manner. He has lately been\r\nfeeding ten steers in an experimental way. He found that for the period\r\nof ten days ending December 29, the average gain per head was thirty-one\r\nand one-tenth pounds. The weather was warm and sunny. The steers were\r\nfed in an unbattened board shed. During the succeeding ten days, when\r\nthe cold was intense almost the entire time, the same steers, fed on the\r\nsame rations, and in the same shed, gained but six and six-tenths pounds\r\nper head. About a year ago the Professor fed a lot of pigs for three\r\nweeks of the coldest weather, in open yards, and found them to consume\r\nmore than three times the amount of food to pound of increase than the\r\nsame number of pigs in the warm basement of the barn. He has a cow kept\r\nin a bleak \"Kansas barn\" which shrinks in her milk from one-fourth to\r\none-half after twenty-four hours of very severe weather. From all this\r\nthe conclusion is what we have so often taught in these columns, though\r\nnot as forcibly as the Professor teaches by his careful experiments,\r\nthat you can not burn feed as fuel to support the body of an animal and\r\nat the same time have the animal stow it away in the form of muscle and\r\nfat. The fact is that our farmers throw away one-half their feed in\r\nfurnishing animal heat that they might just as well save by paying a\r\nsmall lumber bill and expending a moderate amount of labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD WORK AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely the House of Representatives is getting down to solid work since\r\nthe holiday vacation. Mr. Holman, for instance, found no great\r\ndifficulty in getting a resolution passed declaring that in the judgment\r\nof the House all public lands heretofore granted to States and\r\ncorporations in aid of the construction of railroads, so far as the same\r\nis subject to forfeiture by reason of the nonfulfillment of the\r\nconditions on which the grants were made, ought to be declared forfeited\r\nby the United States, and restored to the public domain.\r\n\r\nThis was good work, but Mr. Holman's second resolution, also passed, was\r\nfully as much in accordance with public feeling and desire. It is to the\r\neffect that our laws relating to public lands should be so framed and\r\nadministered as to ultimately secure freeholds to the greatest number of\r\n_citizens_, and to this end all laws facilitating speculation in public\r\nlands authorizing or permitting entry or purchase in large bodies ought\r\nto be repealed, and all public lands adapted to agriculture, subject to\r\nbounty grants, and those in aid of education ought to be reserved for\r\nthe benefit of actual and bona fide settlers, and disposed of only under\r\nthe provisions of the homestead law.\r\n\r\nThere was some opposition to this resolution. Mr. Kasson feared such a\r\nlaw might work injury to the cattle industry. Mr. Bedford, however,\r\nneutralized Mr. Kasson's influence by declaring that he did not propose\r\nthat four or five cattle kings should own the West as four or five\r\nrailway kings own the East.\r\n\r\nIt may be that our readers would like to take down the names of members\r\nwho voted against the resolutions. Here they are: Barksdale, Bingham,\r\nBisbee, George, Horr, Kean, Libbey, Lyman, Morse, Muldrow, Poland,\r\nRanney, Reed, Rice, Russell, Stone, Van Eaton, Whiting.\r\n\r\nNow that the representatives have resolved that these things ought to be\r\ndone let us see if they will stand up to the rack and attend to their\r\npart of the doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN MEETINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb. 5 and 6--The State Horticultural Society in Senate Chamber,\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nFeb. 5--The Wisconsin Cane-Growers Association, Madison.

How much seed to acre? 3. Can blue-grass be grown\r\nsuccessfully mixed with other grasses? 4. What season and what soil is\r\nbest adapted to secure a good catch? 5. Can it be grown on low, wet\r\nland?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. There are almost as many ways to obtain a blue-grass pasture\r\nas there are men who undertake the job, though essentially the practices\r\nare alike. The usual method is to sow the seed in the spring or fall,\r\neither alone or with clover or timothy. 2. The seed is very light and\r\nchaffy, and weighs only fourteen pounds to the bushel, and the amount\r\nsown varies from five to seven pounds to the acre. 3. Yes, though after\r\na few years blue-grass, on a true blue-grass soil, roots every other\r\ngrass out and reigns with a divided empire with white clover. 4. Any\r\ngood corn or wheat soil will produce good blue-grass--the usual method\r\nof obtaining a blue-grass pasture is as follows: To one bushel of good\r\ntimothy seed one quart of red clover is added, and this quantity is made\r\nto cover from five to six acres. The seeding may be done in the fall\r\nwith fall grain, in the spring with oats, or on stubble or wheat land on\r\nthe snow in February. After, in the month of August from a peck to a\r\nhalf bushel of blue-grass is sown upon the young timothy and clover. But\r\nlittle or nothing can be seen of the blue-grass for the first year and\r\nit does not show vigorously until the third year. Thereafter if the soil\r\nis a true blue-grass one and the land is pastured, blue-grass and white\r\nclover dominate to the exclusion of everything else. Perhaps the surest\r\nway to obtain a stand of timothy and thereafter a set of blue-grass, is\r\nto prepare the land carefully and sow rye in October. On this sow\r\ntimothy and red clover as above on the snow in February or March;\r\npasture the rye, but not too closely, to 15th of May. Harvest the rye at\r\nthe usual time, and the yield will be all the better for the pasturing,\r\nand sow the blue-grass seed on the stubble in August. 5. No, but red top\r\nwill in spite of your best efforts to the contrary unless you till and\r\nthoroughly break up the land.\r\n\r\nJOHN ZIMMERMAN, CAMERON, MO.--1. Has setting trees on a fence line as\r\nposts for barb-wire been a success? 2. If so what kind of tree is the\r\nbest? 3. Will the hardy catalpa do, if so what distance apart?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. Barb-wire has not been introduced and used long enough for\r\ntrees set for the purpose of posts to grow to a sufficient size. But in\r\nmany cases aged Osage orange hedges, which have been suffered to grow\r\nup, have been thinned out so as to leave a tree every ten, twelve, or\r\nfifteen feet, and on these barbed-wires have been strung and made a\r\nfence, which so far has proved satisfactory. The same success was\r\nobtained where fruit and shade trees standing in a line have had\r\nbarbed-wire attached to them. But the precaution must be taken to nail a\r\nstrip--a common fence picket will answer--to the tree and then the\r\nbarb-wire to that. If this is not done, and the wire is fastened by a\r\nstaple to the tree, the wood soon overgrows, cracks and increases the\r\nstrain on the wire, damages the tree and spoils the fence. 2. Almost any\r\nfast growing tree will do, but hard wood varieties are preferable. 3.\r\nThe hardy catalpa may do, but for low land we would just as soon have\r\nthe common willow. Eight feet apart is a good distance. The wires may be\r\nfastened to these when they have acquired a diameter of four or five\r\ninches, and later every other post may be removed. For high and dry land\r\nin your latitude one Osage orange is worth a half-dozen catalpas,\r\nbecause it is just as easily grown--and when grown it furnishes the\r\nstrongest and most lasting timber known. We may add here, that where a\r\nfence is wanted across sloughs, or through permanently wet or moist\r\nland, posts large enough for barbed-wire may be grown in a couple of\r\nyears or so--this by cutting stakes six or seven feet long and from\r\nthree to five inches in diameter from the common willow, and setting\r\nthem in March. The stakes require attention the first summer, in case of\r\ndry weather or drouth, but nothing more than that the moist earth shall\r\nbe pressed up against them to prevent the young roots from drying out.\r\n\r\nM. D. VINCENT, SPRINGFIELD, MO.--1. Can you tell me how badly oranges\r\nwere frosted during the late cold spell in Florida? 2. Is there a record\r\nof colder weather at Charleston, S. C., Savannah, Ga., if so when was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. It is hard getting at the facts. One report is that neither\r\noranges nor the trees were injured at Palatka, fifty miles south of\r\nJacksonville, while another just as credible says the fruit was badly\r\nfrozen on the trees as far south as Enterprise, 100 miles south of\r\nJacksonville. The probabilities are, that there was a good deal of\r\ndamage done to fruit on the trees, but no permanent or serious injury to\r\nthe orchards. 2. The mercury may not have been lower for 100 years at\r\nCharleston or Savannah than the late cold spell, but during the winter\r\nof 1834-35 the weather was so severe the orange trees were killed to the\r\nground 100 miles south of Jacksonville. Snow to a foot in depth fell at\r\nMillidgeville, Ga., Lat. 33, and several inches over all northern\r\nFlorida. Some apprehensions are felt that these southern sections are\r\nnot safe from severe frosts for this winter and the next, since it is\r\npretty well known that these extreme cold periods return about every\r\nhalf-century--the winters of near fifty and one hundred years ago having\r\nbeen made remarkable by terribly severe and protracted cold.\r\n\r\nJ. H. J. WATERTOWN, WIS.--Give us the best remedy for chillblains?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Tincture of iodine painted over the parts; or 10 grains of\r\nsalicylic acid extended in an ounce of half water and half alcohol. Both\r\nto be applied with great caution, and largely diluted where the skin is\r\nbroken and ulcers have formed.\r\n\r\nCHARLES C. PETERS, OLNEY, ILL.--If you were about to plant an orchard on\r\nlevelish, but at the same time naturally well drained land, would you\r\nadvise throwing up ridges as the common custom is in some sections?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--It might be advantageous to throw up ridges so as to secure\r\npermanent moisture; but the trees should be set in the depression\r\nbetween them instead of on the ridges.\r\n\r\nTHOROUGHBRED, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a belief or an opinion current\r\namong a class of breeders, always ready to accept and experiment with\r\nnew fangled notions, that the draft breeds imported from abroad,\r\nespecially the high priced French horses, are fed from birth on a more\r\nor less regular ration of bone or flesh meal. This they claim is for the\r\npurpose of developing bone and muscle. What do you know of the facts?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Not much. Some of the foreign journals contain accounts of\r\nexperiments in feeding soluble phosphates of lime, but no two agree on\r\nresults, except that when the salt is judicially fed, no harm is done.\r\nThe subject is worthy of investigation and especially by Kentucky\r\nbreeders, since it would establish the claim that their soil, being\r\nespecially rich in the phosphates and nitrogen, produces grain, hay, and\r\nforage of superior strength for feeding purposes, which appear again, in\r\ntheir high bred stock of horses, sheep, and cattle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fourth National Agricultural Convention, under the auspices of the\r\nAmerican Agricultural Association, will be held at the Grand Central\r\nHotel, New York City, Wednesday and Thursday, February 6th and 7th,\r\n1884. Addresses will be delivered and papers read by leading thinkers\r\nand writers on topics of general interest, and all identified with\r\nagriculture and kindred pursuits are cordially invited to be present and\r\nparticipate in the proceedings. Delegates will be present from all\r\nsections of the country, and arrangements for reduced rates of fare are\r\nbeing made with the railroads leading into New York. The annual meeting\r\nfor the election of officers and the transaction of other business,\r\nincluding the matter of a national agricultural fair, will be held at 12 m.\r\nof the first day of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWayside Notes.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI notice that Mr. Sanders, of the Treasury Cattle Commission, thinks it\r\nbeneath the dignity of Congress to adopt retaliatory measures against\r\nFrance and Germany for prohibiting American pork products from entering\r\nthose countries. He thinks it a far better scheme to appoint a small\r\narmy of inspectors to examine all the pork before it is shipped from\r\nthis country. This might be more dignified, and after a time effectual,\r\nbut how shall we make France and Germany stop shipping their poisoned\r\ngoods to this country? Will they be equally \"dignified\" and appoint\r\ninspectors on their side that will be satisfactory to our people.\r\nProbably they would after a few months of prohibition; never before.\r\nDignity is a good thing, but protection to the health and wealth of the\r\npeople is better. Besides, Government inspectors are expensive luxuries,\r\nand by no means always efficient. A fat Government appointment is a nice\r\nthing--for the appointee, as Mr. Sanders is aware, but it is not\r\nprofitable to the tax-payers of the country to multiply them too\r\nextensively. In my opinion the easiest way out of the muddle is to\r\nstrike back and to hit where it will hurt worst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClinton Babbitt, Secretary of the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society,\r\nis reported to have said at the late meeting of the State Dairymen's\r\nAssociation that he had a very poor opinion of editors. In fact, that he\r\nheld them in about the same esteem as Ben Butler does. Now I don't\r\nsuppose it makes an iota of difference to any editor under the sun what\r\nButler or Babbitt think of him; what Ben and Clint need to look out for\r\nis what the editors think of them. Big Ben got an inkling of this a few\r\nweeks ago; Little Clint's turn may come next.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some time I have been noticing the advanced style of writing in the\r\ntwo or three \"Down East\" agricultural papers that come under my notice.\r\nThey bear evidences of \"culcha\" that are truly encouraging, but here is\r\na case that is actually exhilarating, or would be were it not somewhat\r\nbewildering. It is from an article about the Jersey Lily, Mrs. Langtry:\r\n\"Who ever vocalized such a word with a more complex intonation, or with\r\na more marvellously intimate union with a more inextricably intertwined\r\nrelationship to the most exquisite sensibilities that accompany and mark\r\nthe infinite flights and reachings of the soul, as within its human\r\ncasement it burns with fire divine?\" Now, I call that decidedly fine,\r\nand were I the owner of a whole herd of Jerseys I should endeavor to\r\nengage this genius to write them up for me. At any rate I think he\r\nshould be brought West to help on the Jersey boom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI sent the editors of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, the other day, from\r\nSpringfield, where I was paying a flying visit to the agricultural\r\nrooms, a copy of the Reynolds argument for a change in the awarding of\r\nsweepstakes prizes on cattle. Mr. R. applied it to the Fat Stock Show\r\nalone, and I believe the State Board adopted the suggestions. But for\r\nthe life of me I can not see why the principle is not equally applicable\r\nto the State Fair premiums, and indeed to similar exhibits at all our\r\nfairs. Next year I hope the State Board will extend the innovation to\r\nthe State Fair, and from this it may be it will extend to similar\r\norganizations of lesser magnitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI notice that the National Academy of Sciences have decided that glucose\r\nis not injurious to health. Well, this is good news, at any rate, but it\r\ndoes not follow that manufacturers and merchants have the right to mix\r\nit with cane sugar or sell it to us for genuine cane sirups, or real\r\nhoney, or pure sugar candy, or in any of the other ways in which we are\r\nmade to pay two or three times what it is really worth. It does not do\r\naway with the great need of a rigorous food adulteration act, though\r\nthere is great satisfaction in knowing that when we eat it we are not\r\ntaking in a mild death-dealing potion. But, come to think of it, there\r\nare other great scientists in the country besides those composing the\r\nNational Academy. Some of them have decided in a contrary manner. Is it\r\nnot best to have the question decided by a majority vote of reputable\r\nchemists, and then stick to the good old things, whichever way the\r\ndecision may be? On principle I don't object to suine, oleo, or any of\r\nthe objectionable articles. All I want is to know when I am buying, and\r\npaying for them in real genuine dollars. Bogus dollars are every whit as\r\nrespectable as bogus butter or bogus honey, though the law makes it a\r\nlittle unhealthy to use them with any degree of liberality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Champaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nA light rain yesterday (the 18th) was the first for five weeks, and the\r\nfirst sign of a January thaw we have had. But it began to snow at dark,\r\ncontinued lightly all night, and has been snowing, blowing, and drifting\r\nto-day up to this hour, 2 P. M. Coming soft at first, that part of it\r\nwill lay where it fell, and the uncovered portion of the wheat has got a\r\nnew blanket, which we hope will out-last January. We have had but one so\r\nlong uninterrupted spell of sleighing for these many years, and that was\r\nin the winter of '78-'79. With the exception of the few very cold days\r\nbefore and after the 5th, the month has been quite favorable for stock\r\nand all the labors of the farm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe damage done by the cold wave of January 4th to 7th is believed to be\r\ngreater than first reported. Growers tell me that Snyder blackberries\r\nare killed down to the frost line, which proves it is not iron-clad, as\r\nsome believe. Accounts from the Cobden fruit region are of the gloomiest\r\ncharacter, everything being given up for lost but the strawberries. The\r\nFruit-Grower says they will have to rely on them and their truck patches\r\nthis year, and advises an extension of early potatoes, tomatoes, and\r\nJapan melons. According to local records at Anna, there has been nothing\r\nlike it since the first week in January, 1864; and the estimate of the\r\ndamage done in '84 is computed from what followed in '64, rather than\r\nfrom what is absolutely known. Let us hope that they are mistaken, and\r\nthat the Cobden fruit region will sustain its well-earned character as\r\nthe source of a perennial fruit supply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appears the cold wave did not reach its minimum in Central Florida,\r\nlat. 27, till the night of the 9th, ice having been found on the morning\r\nof the 10th, near Enterprise, three-fourths of an inch thick. Oranges on\r\nthe trees were frozen through, and the leaves killed so they will drop.\r\nBut though here and there a branch may be frosted and will die and have\r\nto be removed, little permanent damage to the groves has probably\r\nresulted. Central Florida is distant, as the crow flies, from Central\r\nIllinois, about one thousand miles. Suppose the cold wave moved steadily\r\nsouthwest, it follows, then, its rate of speed was not far from 200\r\nmiles every twenty-four hours. It is easy to comprehend how a complete\r\nsignal service might warn of the approach of cold waves in time to take\r\nevery necessary precaution to meet and disarm them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut as much of a stinger as the late cold turn was, it was a mere cool\r\nbreeze compared with that which fell on Florida and the entire Southwest\r\nin the winter of 1834-35. Then snow covered all Northern Florida, and in\r\nCentral Georgia it lay on the ground some days, a foot deep. The young\r\norange trees were all killed to the ground, and few of the aged trees\r\nescaped without the loss of most of their branches. But they soon\r\nrecovered--sprouting from the roots and stumps with great vigor, as they\r\nwill again do after the late freeze. And this is one of the strong\r\npoints of the orange. It will sprout from the stump or root when the\r\ntrunk is removed, as surely as the young hickory or chestnut, and when\r\ntransplanted young and trees of considerable size, will bear mutilation\r\nwith about as much indifference as the Osage orange or soft maple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who expect Congress to do anything that will hurt German and\r\nFrench importers, by way of retaliation for prohibiting pork and pork\r\nproducts, will be pretty sure to be disappointed. Senator Williams is\r\nresponsible for the statement that the reason why agriculture is treated\r\nwith so much contempt, is it sustains no lobby. But you may be sure the\r\nimporters will not fail in that respect, as millions will be spent to\r\nprevent legislation which will seriously interfere with the enormous\r\nprofits of the foreign importing houses in New York. Perhaps Senator\r\nWilliams will inform us what it will cost to keep up a well appointed\r\nlobby in Washington, and how much the average one-horse lawyers in\r\nCongress expect, in money down, in the way of a retainer. Huntington\r\ncould tell, and so could Jay Gould; but both are silenced for the\r\npresent, and Villard too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Put your thumb down there.\" That the trees on low lands which bore big\r\ncrops in 1874-75, are just the trees which bore crops equally in '83,\r\nand the very trees also which have made the most vigorous growth both\r\npreviously and last year.

We have had Rock pullets commence laying at six months, and once we\r\nhad a few that didn't do a thing toward earning their own living till\r\nthey were almost eight months old; but seven months is nearer the\r\naverage, and that is what we count on when selecting the pullets that\r\nare to be kept for winter layers. The pullets that are hatched from the\r\nfirst of March up to the first of May, commence laying all along from\r\nthe middle of September to the first of December. Pullets that we want\r\nto commence laying in February, are selected from those hatched in July.\r\nIt would really be very gratifying to me if the people who know no more\r\nabout the Plymouth Rocks than they do about the fate of Charlie Ross,\r\nwould keep their twaddle out of print.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of my correspondents is very anxious to know if the Langshans are\r\nthe \"coming fowls.\" Hardly.

They\r\nwill never hold the place that the Plymouth Rocks hold. Since you wish\r\nto buy fowls of the breeds for which there will be the greatest demand\r\nnext season, I should advise you get Plymouth Rocks and Wyandottes.\r\nThese, in addition to the Light Brahmas and Brown Leghorns that you\r\nalready have, will give you the four breeds that are the most popular,\r\nand if you have good stock, and let people know that you have eggs to\r\nsell for hatching, you will probably have orders for all the eggs that\r\nyou will care to sell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent wants to know the meaning of the word \"strain,\" as\r\napplied to fowls, and I don't wonder that he asks the question, for the\r\nword is used \"promiscuous like\" by every tyro in poultry breeding.\r\n\r\nWhen any poultry-raiser has bred fowls of any breed long enough to fix\r\nhis notion of what constitutes a standard fowl of that breed upon them\r\npermanently, he may claim a \"strain.\" For instance: Smith believes that\r\nthe Light Brahmas should have very short legs, and he breeds for short\r\nlegs until they are permanently fixed, and everybody who knows anything\r\nabout Light Brahmas knows one of Smith's short-legged Brahmas at sight;\r\nthen, but not before, Smith may claim a strain of his own, and it is\r\nproper for others to speak of \"Smith's strain\" of Light Brahmas. But\r\nJohnson, who buys of Smith, or of some one who has Light Brahmas of\r\nSmith's strain, this year, should not next year talk about \"my own\r\nstrain\" of Light Brahmas. It takes years of steady, judicious breeding\r\nafter a certain type to establish what may truthfully be called a\r\nstrain, and it can only be done by breeders of rare skill and long\r\nexperience in mating fowls for breeding.\r\n\r\n    FANNY FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken Houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI often read inquiries about the best plan for building hen houses. My\r\nplan is, for 100 fowls, to build a house for them to roost in, eight or\r\neven ten feet wide and sixteen feet long, one story high with tight\r\nfloor of yellow pine flooring. I prefer a tight floor because it is\r\neasily cleaned out, and every time it is cleaned out and swept the floor\r\nshould be well covered with slaked lime; one cleaning a week is often\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nA building of the same size should be built with a dirt floor, or close\r\none, as preferred, about ten or fifteen feet from the roosting house for\r\nthe hens to lay and sit in. A petition may be made of laths dividing the\r\nhouse into two compartments, the front arranged for the laying hens and\r\nthe back compartments for sitting hens; then the laying hens will not\r\ndisturb the sitting hens. A closed passway should be made, say one and\r\none half or two feet square leading from the roosting house to the\r\nlaying house with a sliding door at each end to be used at pleasure. As\r\nit often happens in cold, snowy weather in winter it is not desirable to\r\nlet the fowls out, then the slides at each end of the passway can be\r\nopened and feed and water placed in the laying house (because the floor\r\nin that house will always be cleanest), and all the fowls will soon\r\nlearn to go in there to eat and drink, and lay if they want to. It is, I\r\nthink, bad policy to force fowls to roost, lay, and sit all in the same\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe boxes that contain the nests should be made so that they can be at\r\nany time taken out and the nests turned out in a pile, set on fire and\r\nthe boxes held over the fire to kill any lice that may be sticking to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n    B. F. C.\r\n        HIKE'S POINT, KY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA person signing himself a \"Nobleman's Gardener,\" says in an English\r\npaper that it is a mistake to use poultry manure as a top-dressing for\r\ngarden crops; for farm crops also, if the poultry and pigeon dung were\r\nin any considerable bulk. This, however, is not usually the case, and a\r\nhundred weight or two would not make much of an impression on a farm.\r\nThe manure in question is a powerful fertilizer, containing ammonia,\r\nphosphates, and carbonate of lime in considerable quantity, also uric\r\nacid, all of which are valuable ingredients for the support of crops.\r\nThe simplest method of preparing the manure for use is to partially dry\r\nit, then mix it with perfectly dry sifted soil or ashes in sufficient\r\nquantity that will enable the entire mixture to be rubbed through a\r\nhalf-inch sieve. A man can do this comfortably with the hand inclosed in\r\na thick leather glove. In this finely powdered state it can be stored in\r\na dry shed till wanted for use. It is an excellent top-dressing for\r\nonions, strawberries, and, in fact, for all vegetable crops that need\r\nassistance, also for fruit trees and lawns. It is best applied in\r\nshowery weather in the spring--for lawns at the rate of two ounces,\r\nvegetable crops and strawberries three ounces, and fruit trees four\r\nounces per square yard. If in very large bulk and needed for use in\r\nfields it would scarcely be necessary to pulverize it, as mixing it with\r\ndry soil, etc., and turning the heap over a few times would suffice for\r\nits ready application.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as\r\nthe arguments urged, which, well considered, requires as great a mental\r\nforce as the direct sequence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nCheapest Farms for Sale in Illinois.\r\n\r\nBEST FRUIT REGION IN THE STATE.\r\n\r\nSend for my List of Farms and timbered Lands for sale.\r\n    DEWITT C.

Fortunately the injury is not beyond a remedy, for it is\r\neasier to restore a growth of timber than it is to bring back fertility\r\nto a barren soil. It is easy to care for what is left and to replant and\r\nrenew the growth, and even to do this better and more quickly and with\r\nmore and quicker profit than nature has done it. It is easy, too, by a\r\nwise and practical use of the forests that are left, to so husband them\r\nas to take regular harvests from them as the farmer regularly harvests\r\nhis fields or selects the fatlings from his flocks. He does not gather\r\nin all these at one fell swoop, taking the fat and the lean and the\r\nyoung and the old, as the fisherman gathers all into his nets, and as\r\nthe lumberman has felled the woods, but he selects those that are ripe\r\nand carefully rears the rest until they are ready. Had the timber been\r\nculled in this way from the forests year by year there would have been a\r\nperiodical harvest, and as the mature trees were cut out a new growth\r\nwould spring up. But, on the contrary, as in the old fable, the goose\r\nhas been killed for its golden eggs, and the source of a lasting profit\r\nhas been recklessly sacrificed.\r\n\r\nFortunately the land is left, and can be put to its proper use as soon\r\nas it can be controlled. And still fortunately, by a wise\r\nadministration, the forests may be made a profitable source of public\r\nincome, instead of, as heretofore, the prey of the spoilers. It is\r\nuseless to complain of past mistakes. They have been, as we have pointed\r\nout, mere incidents of our system, and possibly unavoidable. But the\r\ntime has come when the system must be changed, and the necessity for a\r\nchange has become so apparent that it can not be long delayed. It is not\r\nonly the commerce of the country that must suffer by a continuance of\r\nthe system, but agriculture suffers still more; and it is not only the\r\npublic who will gain by a change, but the example will be followed by\r\nthe farmers, who will doubtless soon learn to take care of their own\r\ntimber lands and plant more, and so the benefit will be general.\r\nBesides, the farmers will not be long in discovering the profit in\r\ngrowing timber, and would plant groves as one of the most profitable\r\ncrops that could be grown upon their rougher lands, or as a resting and\r\nrestorative crop for their worn soil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the New York Academy of Science a few days ago, Professor Albert\r\nR. Leeds gave some \"facts gathered from eight years of personal\r\ninspection as to the alleged destruction of the Adirondack forests.\" He\r\nsaid that a rapid course of spoilation was going on in the outskirts of\r\nthe forest, and the effect of it would soon be felt in the flow of the\r\nHudson. The impression that the Adirondacks were pine-producing was a\r\nfalse one. Pine trees were seldom seen and the mountains were covered\r\nwith spruce and hemlock. But the spruces, owing to a disease which\r\nattacked them a few years ago, are rapidly dying off. On the Ausable\r\nriver and along the shores of Lake Champlain the destruction of the\r\nforest is especially great. Persons living about the forest start fires\r\nin the woodland which spread rapidly and are more destructive to the\r\ntrees than the lumbermen. Professor Leeds thought that the railways\r\nwhich are making their way through the forests would be an important\r\nelement in their destruction, for the sparks of the locomotives would\r\noriginate forest fires. He said that the purchase of the forests by the\r\nState might not require so great an expenditure of money as was\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn closing an article on \"Forestry and Farming,\" the Germantown\r\nTelegraph maintains that the idea that farmers and land-owners generally\r\nentertain that they may not live to enjoy the advantages of the\r\ntree-planting, should be utterly banished from their minds. It will\r\nrequire only about twenty years to realize the most liberal hopes of\r\nsuccess; at least it will add to the value of the farm by the fact that\r\nthe amount of timber is to be increased instead of diminished. We all\r\nknow how anxious every purchaser of a tract of land is to know whether\r\nthere is any and how much timber upon a farm offered for sale. In fact,\r\nthere is no greater mistake made than to cut down the wood upon a farm\r\nwhen purchased, with a view to meet the second payment; and this mistake\r\nis invariably brought home to everyone in a few years. It is like taking\r\nthe life-blood out of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Weather Wisdom.\r\n\r\nAlmost from its invention the barometer has been vaunted an indicator of\r\nimpending weather, and now we are in possession of numberless rules for\r\ninterpreting its indications, mostly of a vague and indefinite purport,\r\nfew, if any, pretending to accuracy and certainty. As mankind are always\r\ndesirous of attaining weather wisdom, these rules have tended to give\r\nthe barometer its widely recognized reputation, rather than any really\r\ninfallible principles, clearly formulated. With no other philosophical\r\ninstrument have people so deluded themselves as with the barometer.\r\nMeteorology having become almost an official monopoly, the officials\r\nseem to have made the readiest and largest amount of reputation out of\r\nthe barometer as a weather glass; for all that they have had to do is to\r\ncompile rules from a number of authors, without any necessity of\r\nacknowledgment, print as much as they please at the Government expense,\r\ngive it away freely, and the notoriety of authorship is secured easily\r\nand expeditiously. Thus the British nation has been officially supplied\r\nwith about eighteen different editions of the Barometer Manual, widely\r\ndiffering from each other according to the views of the authors; for\r\nalthough the book remains the self-styled authors change, much the same\r\nas with the Cambridge books on mathematics. A study of the edition,\r\n\"Coast or Fishery Barometer Manual,\" teaches that the barometer\r\nforetells coming weather; that it does not always foretell coming\r\nweather; that only few are able to understand much about what it does\r\ntell us; that it may be used by ordinary persons without difficulty;\r\nthat its indications are sometimes erroneous: that any one observing it\r\nonce a day may be always weatherwise; that its warnings do not apply\r\nalways to the locality of the instrument; that storms frequently occur\r\nwithout its giving any warning; that barometer depressions happen with\r\nand without gales; and similar ambiguous or contradictory assertions ad\r\nnauseam. It is perfectly astounding to contemplate that official\r\nauthority sanctions such inconsistent teaching, and moreover\r\ndisseminates it far and wide, forcing its circulation by giving it away\r\ngratuitously on humane and eleemosynary grounds. Where only such\r\nconfusing advice and direction can be given is it becoming to stamp it\r\nas official? it is lamentable inconsiderateness to expect fishermen to\r\nbe able to dodge the weather by such guidance; and it is time to stop\r\nthis easily concocted nostrum for notoriety; for it is vague and\r\ninconclusive in every precept, and has scarcely an assertion which is\r\nnot contradicted by some other.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Remarkable Electrical Discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Times of recent date states that a new electrical contrivance\r\nhas been perfected by Mr. A. St. George, the inventor of the telephone\r\nwhich bears his name. This invention, which is really supplemental to\r\nthe telephone, will enable every description of conversation carried on\r\nthrough the instrument to be not only recorded but reproduced at any\r\nfuture time. Briefly stated, Mr. St. George's invention may be thus\r\ndescribed: A circular plate of glass is coated with collodion and made\r\nsensitive as a photographic plate. This is placed in a dark box, in\r\nwhich is a slit to admit a ray of light. In front of the glass is a\r\ntelephone diaphragm, which, by its vibrations, opens and closes a small\r\nshutter through which a beam of light is constantly passing and\r\nimprinting a dark line on the glass. Vibrations of the shutter cause the\r\ndark line to vary in thickness according to the tones of the voice. The\r\nglass plate is revolved by clock work, and the conversation as it leaves\r\nthe telephone is recorded on the sensitive plate, the imprinted words\r\nspoken being fixed as is done in photography. The plate can be brought\r\nforward afterwards, and when replaced in the machine and connected with\r\na distant telephone, will, when set in motion, give back the original\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 1881, a gentleman in Newburgh, N. Y., inclosed a spider\r\nin a small paper box. He carefully guarded and watched it, and affirms\r\nthat for 204 days it partook of no food or water. It showed no\r\nemaciation, and appeared as active and strong as at first until within a\r\nvery few days of its death on May 7, 1882. Tamerlane learned patience\r\nfrom a spider; perhaps Tanner was taught by them how to fast. The Hour,\r\nfrom which we take this item, also has the following: Another spider\r\nstory is sent from California by the Rev. Dr. McCook, of honey-ant fame.\r\nHe found a small cocoon of eggs and young spiders, which had no less\r\nthan five other kinds of insects living in and about it. These intruders\r\nconsisted of small red ants, a diminutive beetle, and a series formed by\r\na minute chalcid, parasitic on a larger chalcid, which was parasitic on\r\nan ichneumon, which was parasitic on the spider. All were seeking to\r\ndevour the eggs and spiderlings, yet the whole cocoonful, victims\r\nincluded, seemed to be living on most amicable terms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVarious methods for hastening the conversion of cider into vinegar have\r\nbeen recommended. A French method is as follows: Scald three barrels or\r\ncasks with hot water, rinse thoroughly and empty. Then scald with\r\nboiling vinegar, rolling the barrels and allowing them to stand on their\r\nsides two or three days until they become thoroughly saturated with the\r\nvinegar. The barrels are then filled about one-third full with strong\r\npure cider vinegar and two gallons of cider added. Every eighth day\r\nthereafter two gallons of cider are added until the barrels are\r\ntwo-thirds full. The whole is allowed to stand fourteen days longer,\r\nwhen it will be found to be good vinegar, and one-half of it may be\r\ndrawn and the process of filling with cider be begun again. In summer\r\nthe barrels are allowed to stand exposed to the sun and in cold weather\r\nkept where the temperature is 80 degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Party of the United States Geological Survey have found it practicable\r\nto ride to the highest peak of Mount Shasta, and suggest the\r\nestablishment there of a third elevated station for weather\r\nobservations, similar to those on Pike's Peak and Mount Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA herring produces from 30,000 to 50,000 eggs, and the eggs are so small\r\nin size that 20,000 can be put one layer thick on a square foot of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOUGHS AND HOARSENESS.--The irritation which induces coughing\r\nimmediately relieved by use of \"_Brown's Bronchial Troches_.\"\r\nSold only in boxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nTo Our Readers.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is the OLDEST, MOST RELIABLE, and the LEADING\r\nAGRICULTURAL JOURNAL OF THE GREAT NORTHWEST, devoted exclusively to the\r\ninterests of the Farmer, Gardener, Florist, Stock Breeder, Dairyman,\r\nEtc., and every species of Industry connected with that great portion of\r\nthe People of the World, the PRODUCERS.

S.\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"_Walks and Talks on the Farm_,\" \"_Farm Crops_,\" \"_Harris on\r\nthe Pig_,\" _etc._\r\n\r\nWhile we have no lack of treatises upon artificial fertilizers, there is\r\nno work in which the main stay of the farm--the manure made upon the\r\nfarm is treated so satisfactorily or thoroughly as in this volume.\r\nStarting with the question,\r\n\r\n\"WHAT IS MANURE?\"\r\n\r\nthe author, well known on both sides of the water by his writings, runs\r\nthrough in sufficient detail every source of manure on the farm,\r\ndiscussing the methods of making rich manure; the proper keeping and\r\napplying it, and especially the\r\n\r\nUSES OF MANURE,\r\n\r\nand the effects of different artificial fertilizers, as compared with\r\nfarm-yard manure, upon different crops. In this he makes free use of the\r\nstriking series of experiments instituted years ago, and still\r\ncontinued, by Lawes and Gilbert, of Rothamsted, England. The\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE TABLES\r\n\r\nin which the results of these experiments are given, are here for the\r\nfirst time made accessible to the American farmer. In fact, there is\r\nscarcely any point relating to fertilizing the soil, including suitable\r\nmanures for special crops, that is not treated, and while the teachings\r\nare founded upon the most elaborate scientific researches, they are so\r\nfar divested of the technical language of science as to commend\r\nthemselves to farmers as eminently \"practical.\" It is not often that the\r\nresults of scientific investigations are presented in a manner so\r\nthoroughly popular. 12mo.

Silk culture, poultry raising, and various other themes have been\r\nthoroughly ventilated, and the result has no doubt been very beneficial;\r\nbut there are many ladies who have no opportunity to raise silk worms,\r\nor follow any business of that kind. To that class I wish to open what\r\nto me was an entirely new field.\r\n\r\nSome three months ago an uncle of mine from Albany, N. Y., was visiting\r\nat our house, and we were talking of plated ware, which he is engaged in\r\nmanufacturing, and to gratify my curiosity he made a plating machine and\r\nreplated our knives, forks, spoons and caster. It only cost $4, and it\r\ndid the work perfectly. Some of our neighbors saw what we had plated,\r\nand wanted me to do some plating for them. Since then I have worked\r\ntwenty-two days, clearing in that time $94.34. At almost every house I\r\ngot from $2 to $3 worth of plating to do, and such work is most all\r\nprofit. This business is as nice for ladies as it is for gentlemen,\r\nbeing all indoor work, and any one can do it. My brother, although he\r\nworked two days longer than I did, only made $91.50. I am getting up a\r\ncollection of curiosities, and to any of your readers that will send me\r\na specimen I will send them full directions for making and using a\r\nplating machine like mine that will plate gold, silver and nickel. Send\r\nsmall pieces of stones, ores, shells, wood, leaves of trees, plants,\r\netc. Anything small will do. What I want to get is as many different\r\nspecimens from as many different places all over the country as I can.\r\nAddress\r\n\r\n    MISS M. F. CASSEY.\r\n        OBERLIN, OHIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Night Cap.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a late letter to the August Constitution Jas. R. Randall discourses\r\nthus pleasantly of the efficiency of the night cap in producing sleep:\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o'clock at night we boarded the sleeping coach for Washington.\r\nJust before retiring for the night my mind, somehow or other, reverted\r\nto an editorial article recently published in the New York Times, half\r\nserious, half earnest, concerning the latest theory of an English\r\nphysician as to the prepotent cause of insomnia and nervous disorders\r\ngenerally. It may be remembered that to the abandonment of the night cap\r\nof our grandfathers (the cotton or flannel article, not the alcoholic)\r\nwas attributed the modern tendency of sleeplessness that make even a\r\nphilosopher like Herbert Spencer more or less of a crank. What I wanted,\r\nand wanted as the fellow did his pistol in Texas, was first-class\r\nslumber, just such unmitigated repose as occasionally comes to a highly\r\norganized baby, unvexed by colic or pure cussedness. I began to think\r\nthat perhaps that British doctor was right, and that, if it were\r\npossible, I would return to the neglected custom of my ancestors. Just\r\nat that moment I plunged my hand into my coat pocket and pulled out a\r\nsilk smoking-cap--a pretty thing, wrought for me long ago by the dainty,\r\ndelicate, deft fingers of one who now rests in the graveyard at Augusta.\r\nThis cap was the very thing. I placed it reverently upon my head, with\r\nan act of faith, and lay down. The result was magical. Never since I was\r\na boy can I remember to have experienced so perfect and delicious a\r\nrepose. Not a dream rippled the surface of my calm brain, and I awakened\r\nhours afterward with a sense of satisfaction that must be a foretaste of\r\nheaven itself. An incipient headache had vanished. Powers of mind that\r\nhad been dulled were restored to animation and keenness. Not a trace of\r\nirascibility remained; but in its place came trooping the sweet angels\r\nthat Father Faber says continually hover over the good-humored man. I\r\ndeclare that the metamorphosis was so complete that I almost needed an\r\nintroduction to my new self. And this prodigy was created by one grand,\r\ncomplete and unusual slumber, when wearing a nightcap! Subsequent\r\nexperiments have been relatively successful; so I am getting to be an\r\nenthusiast on the subject. Some folks say that it is a delusion, a mere\r\nfreak of the imagination. Be it so. If a nightcap can extinguish my\r\nimagination at bed-time, thank God for the discovery! My good old mother\r\ntells me that when I was a little fellow she used to tie a nightcap\r\nunder my chin, and that I was a famous sleeper in those times. She is a\r\nfirm believer in the efficacy. Likely enough if a man eats pickled pig's\r\nfeet at midnight or drinks unlimited whisky, even a silk or cotton\r\nnightcap may not consign him to the arms of Morpheus; but it may work\r\nwonders for a sober person who is cursed with the pestilent habit of\r\nconjuring up all manner or odd fancies when his head touches the pillow,\r\ninstead of dismissing the workmen who hammer on the forges of the brain.\r\nThe majority of the men will rather suffer nocturnal horrors than be\r\nlaughed at for wearing nightcaps; just as the majority of women will\r\nprefer to wear shoes that are instruments of disease and torture rather\r\nthan have their feet shod comfortably and sensibly. I have a clear idea\r\nas to which is the course of wisdom and which the alternative of folly.\r\nBut this is a diversion which you, readers, may smile at or not as the\r\nwhim seizes you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Treat a Boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet hold of the boy's heart. Yonder locomotive comes like a whirlwind\r\ndown the track, and a regiment of armed men might seek to arrest it in\r\nvain. It would crush them, and plunge unheeding on. But there is a\r\nlittle lever in the mechanism that at the pressure of a man's hand will\r\nslacken its speed, and in a moment bring it panting and still, like a\r\nwhipped spaniel, at your feet. By the same little lever the vast steamer\r\nis guided hither and yonder upon the sea, in spite of the adverse winds\r\nor current. That sensitive and responsive spot by which a boy's life is\r\ncontrolled is his heart. With your grasp gently and firmly on that helm,\r\nyou may pilot him whither you will. Never doubt that he has a heart. Bad\r\nand willful boys very often have the tenderest hearts hidden somewhere\r\nbeneath incrustations of sin or behind barricades of pride. And it is\r\nyour business to get at that heart, keep hold of it by sympathy,\r\nconfiding in him, manifestly working only for his good by little\r\nindirect kindnesses to his mother or sister, or even his pet dog. See\r\nhim at his home, or invite him into yours. Provide him some little\r\npleasures, set him at some little service of trust for you; love him;\r\nlove him practically. Anyway and every way rule him through his heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Etiquette now admits of a second plate of soup.\" That is all right, but\r\nif a man's appetite will not admit of a second plate of soup, etiquette\r\nis nothing to him.

On eight days of this\r\nmonth the thermometer has been below zero. It has been above the\r\nfreezing point only on one morning, the 13th. Sleighing is good, except\r\non some of the graveled roads. Cattle are in good condition. The horse\r\ndistemper prevails in some localities among colts. Hay is plenty. A few\r\nfat hogs were sold last week. One farmer, in Kaneville, sold 80 hogs,\r\naveraging 443 pounds each, at $6.10 per cwt. There are but very few fat\r\nhogs left. The cold, dry weather has improved the condition of corn in\r\nthe cribs. Coarse feed is scarce. Considerable corn has been shipped\r\nhere from Kansas. Bran and middlings are coming in from Minneapolis, and\r\nsell at $15 and and $17 per ton. Cheese factory dividends for November\r\nfrom $1.50 to $1.60 per cwt. Large quantities of milk are daily shipped\r\ninto Chicago from this county.\r\n\r\n    J. P. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI see that you request items in regard to the cold wave that swept over\r\nour country during the first week in this month. There is no doubt the\r\ncold was as intense over the country generally as it has been known for\r\nmany years, or perhaps ever before, but so far as I can learn the\r\ndamage to fruit trees, etc., is very slight. On the morning of the 16th\r\nof December we had our first snow, but the weather was quite pleasant to\r\nthe end of the year, with occasionally slight freezing, but thermometer\r\nnever down to zero.\r\n\r\nThe result of this favorable weather was the thorough ripening up of the\r\nwood of all fruit and ornamental trees, so that when on the 5th of the\r\npresent month the mercury ran down to 26 degrees below zero, and in some\r\nparts of the country far below that even, the damage was very slight.\r\nThe writer has been extensively engaged in cutting scions, and knows\r\nwhereof he speaks. I have also examined some peach trees and find the\r\nwood slightly discolored but not dead. I did not thoroughly examine the\r\nfruit buds of the peach, but suppose, of course, they are all killed.\r\nHad this intense cold weather occurred early in December, there is no\r\ndoubt but the damage would have been immense.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great loss of potatoes in cellars and pits, as most\r\npeople had worked themselves into the belief that we were to have a mild\r\nwinter, and had not prepared their cellars to resist cold at the rate of\r\n30 degrees below zero. The result is that thousands of bushels of\r\npotatoes are frozen and ruined, and although the largest crop of\r\npotatoes was raised last year that ever was raised in the United States,\r\nyet potatoes will be high priced before planting time.\r\n\r\n    H.

TERRY.\r\n        CRESCENT CITY, IA., Jan. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed Corn Famine.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably nineteen farmers in twenty must buy seed corn for next spring's\r\nplanting, on account of the failure of the '83 crop to ripen. We must\r\nlook sharp to the seeds we buy, that they are better than our own, as\r\nmany unreliable parties will offer inferior stocks, to take advantage of\r\nthe demand. We suggest that every corn grower should send to Hiram\r\nSibley & Co., the reliable seedsmen at Rochester, N. Y., and Chicago,\r\nIll., for their catalogue and seed-corn circulars. This house makes a\r\nspecialty of seed-corn and we believe that they will do what they say\r\nthey will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAPS.\r\n\r\nRAND, McNALLY & CO.'S\r\nNEW RAILROAD\r\n--AND--\r\nCOUNTY MAP\r\n--OF THE--\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n--AND--\r\nDOMINION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nSize, 4 × 2-1/2 feet, mounted on rollers to hang on the wall.

Every one predicted that when the ice\r\nshould break in the river, there would be a grand spectacle, and danger,\r\ntoo, as well; and all waited with some anxiety for the \"break\" to come.\r\n\r\nOne morning, we at the village were awakened by a deep, roaring,\r\nbooming, crashing noise, and sprang from our beds, crying:\r\n\r\n\"The ice has broken up! The ice is running out!\"\r\n\r\nIn hardly more time than it takes to tell it, we were dressed and at the\r\nback windows, which looked down upon the river!\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a grand sight!\r\n\r\nHuge cakes of ice of every shape and size were driving, tumbling,\r\ncrashing past, as if in a mad race with each other. The river, filled to\r\noverflowing, seemed in angry haste to hurl its icy burden down the falls\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nBut after a few days the river ran clear, save for the occasional\r\nbreaking of some \"jam\" above. Along the margin of the broad stream,\r\nhowever, there were here and there slight indentures, or notches, in the\r\nbanks, where the ice had escaped the mad rush of waters and still clung\r\nin considerable patches.\r\n\r\nIt was upon one of these still undisturbed patches that \"Jule\" Fisher, a\r\nrough boy of fourteen, with several of his equally rough comrades, was\r\nplaying on the lovely morning upon which my story opens.\r\n\r\nThese lads were not the sons of the steady, intelligent, church-going\r\ninhabitants of this quiet Northern hamlet, but were from the families of\r\n\"lumbermen,\" \"river-drivers\" and \"shingle-shavers.\" For some time they\r\nhad been having boisterous sport, venturing out upon the extreme edges\r\nof the ice and with long poles pushing about the stray cakes which\r\noccasionally came within their reach.\r\n\r\nAt length they grew tired of this, and began to jump upon ticklish\r\npoints of ice; and as these began to crack and show signs of breaking\r\naway, the boys would run, with wild whoops, back to shore, the very\r\ndanger seeming to add to their enjoyment. Then, with poles and \"prys,\"\r\nthey would work upon the cracking mass until it floated clear and went\r\nwhirling down the rapid current.\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy, boys!\" called Jule, who was seemingly their leader. \"Up yender's\r\na big cake that only wants a shove! Come on! Let's set 'er a-going!\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done. Away went the noisy fellows to the projecting\r\npoint of ice. A few smart jumps sent it creaking and groaning, as though\r\nstill unwilling to quit its snug winter bed. One more jump, and the boys\r\nall ran with a shout beyond the place where the ice was cracking\r\noff--all save Jule.\r\n\r\nIt had not broken clear, and he was determined to set it going, when he\r\nwould spring on the firm ice beyond, as he had done once or twice\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut this time he was over-bold and not sufficiently watchful. A large\r\ncake of ice had come floating down the river unnoticed either by him or\r\nhis friends, and striking the edge of the nearly loosened mass, shoved\r\nit out into the swift, black water.\r\n\r\nPoor Jule! He ran quickly to the freshly-broken edge--but, alas! too\r\nlate for the intended spring. The swiftly-rushing current had borne him\r\nmany yards from the shore and from his companions.\r\n\r\nThere he stood--for an instant in dumb amaze--balancing himself upon his\r\nrocking raft with the pole he had been using. To attempt to swim ashore\r\nwould have been useless. He was a clumsy swimmer at best; and the cold,\r\nrushing waters and floating ice cakes made swimming almost impossible.\r\n\r\nHe could not get off. To stay seemed sure death. Dumb with fright, for a\r\nmoment he stood in speechless terror. Then there rang across the wild,\r\nblack river and through the quiet streets of the village, such a yell of\r\nabject fear as only a lusty lad of that age can give. It was a cry that\r\nchilled the heart of every one who heard it.\r\n\r\nA \"four-days' meeting\" was in session. The village church-goers were\r\njust issuing from their houses in answer to the church bell, when that\r\npitiful cry and the shouts of \"Help! Help! A boy in the stream!\" reached\r\nthem, and drew them all quickly to the river bank.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the shore was lined with excited men and women. Yet all\r\nstood helplessly staring, while poor Jule on his ice-raft was floating\r\nsteadily down toward the falls.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget how he looked as he stood there in the middle of\r\nhis floating white throne! There was something almost heroic in his calm\r\nhelplessness. For after the first wild cry, he had not once opened his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nDownward he floated, drawn swiftly and surely on by the deep, mighty\r\nrush of waters setting into the throat of the cataract. The heavy roar\r\nfrom far below sounded like the luckless lad's knell. He stood but a\r\nsingle chance--and that was hardly a chance--of his ice-raft lodging\r\nagainst a tilted-up \"jam\" of cakes and logs which had piled against a\r\njagged ledge that rose in mid-stream, just above the brink of the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nThis \"jam\" had hung there, wavering in the flood, for thirty-six hours.\r\nEvery moment it seemed about to go off--yet still it clung, in tremor,\r\nas it seemed, at the fatal plunge which would dash it to pieces in the\r\nthundering maelstrom below.\r\n\r\nGood fortune--Providence, perhaps--so guided Jule's ice-raft that it\r\nstruck and lodged against the \"jam,\" just as the horrified watchers on\r\nshore expected to lose sight of the lad forever in the falls. \"If it\r\nwill only hang there!\" muttered scores, scarcely daring as yet to speak\r\na loud word.\r\n\r\nThey could see the cake, with Jule on it, heaving up and down with the\r\nmighty rhythmic motion of the surging torrent; and all ran along down\r\nthe banks, to come nearer. The boy stood in the very jaws of death.\r\nBeneath, the cataract roared and hurled up white gusts of spray.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, a short, thick-set man, with a round, good-natured\r\nface, joined the crowd. For a moment he stood looking out at the lad,\r\nthen slapping another young man on the shoulder, said, hurriedly, \"Isn't\r\nthere an old bateau stowed away in your shed, Lanse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, then!\" exclaimed the first speaker. \"There isn't a moment to\r\nlose.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mac,\" answered Lanse, as he hurried after him. \"I'm afraid she's\r\nno good; she's old and she's been stowed away all winter. Ten to one the\r\nold thing leaks like a riddlin' sieve.\r\n\r\n\"But we mustn't lose a chance!\" exclaimed Mac. \"That jam will go out\r\nwithin half an hour, if it doesn't within ten minutes!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the two had reached the shed. They quickly drew the bateau\r\nfrom its wintering place, and taking the long, light boat upon their\r\nshoulders, ran rapidly through the village and down to the river.\r\n\r\nMeantime, two or three other men had run to fetch \"dog warps\" and\r\n\"towing-lines,\" a large number of which are always kept in these\r\nbackwoods lumbering hamlets, for use on the rivers and lakes, when logs\r\nare rafted out in the spring.\r\n\r\nActing under Mac's prompt orders, a six-hundred foot warp was at once\r\nmade fast to a ring in the stern of a bateau, and another line laid\r\nready to bend to the first.\r\n\r\nJumping into the bateau, paddle in hand, and a boat-hook laid ready for\r\ninstant use, the bold young fellow now ordered the men to shove off the\r\nskiff into the river and then pay out the line, as he should\r\ndirect--thus lowering him, yard by yard, down toward the \"jam\" where\r\nJule stood.\r\n\r\nRod by rod, they let him down toward the roaring abyss of furious\r\nwaters, till the bateau--guided by the paddle, and held back now by the\r\nmain strength of twenty men--touched the ice-cake.\r\n\r\nBut even as it touched, the cake began to slide off the jam; and Jule\r\nwas thrown on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought, however, his courageous rescuer struck his boat-hook\r\ninto the ice and held fast while Jule, stiff with fright, tumbled in at\r\nthe bow of the bateau.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly in the boat when the whole mass of ice and logs went over\r\nthe falls.\r\n\r\nA shout arose, and when a few minutes later the bateau was drawn safely\r\nback up the stream, and Mac stepped ashore with a rather bashful smile\r\non his round, fresh face, every one joined in long and prolonged cheers.\r\n\r\nAs for Jule, he had to be helped out of the boat and led home; for he\r\nwas, as they said, \"limp as a rag;\" and it was noticed that after this\r\nperilous adventure he was a much more sober and thoughtful boy.\r\n\r\nPray do not imagine, reader, that I have been telling you a \"made-up\"\r\nstory, for what I have related is true, the writer herself being an\r\neye-witness to the incident while a teacher in a backwoods\r\nschool-district on the banks of the Aroostook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLIVE STOCK, Etc.\r\n\r\n       PUBLIC SALE\r\n           OF\r\n    Short-Horn Cattle\r\n           AT\r\n_Somers, Kenosha Co., Wis._\r\n           ON\r\n Wednesday, March 19, 1884.\r\n\r\nI will sell at public sale, at my farm near Somers, Wis., at above time\r\nand place, my entire herd of Thoroughbred Short-horn cattle, numbering\r\nforty head.

The bar-room was crowded, and a general shout of\r\nwelcome greeted him as he entered, for Amos was a generous fellow, and\r\nwas always willing to treat.\r\n\r\nThe five dollar bill was quickly broken by the jovial bar-keeper, and\r\ntwo hours later when Amos waked rather unsteadily out of the saloon, he\r\nhad not a cent in his pocket. But this did not trouble him in the least.\r\nHe had spent too much money in Sillbrook's during the last two years to\r\nthink anything of squandering in one evening such a paltry sum as five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nAs he left the saloon by the main entrance, he saw a man emerge from a\r\nside door of the building, and cross the street with rapid strides; a\r\ntall man, well dressed, and bearing about him a look of prosperity. He\r\nwore a very handsome overcoat with sealskin cuffs and collar, a sealskin\r\ncap, and well fitting gloves. Drunk as Amos was he recognized him at\r\nonce; it was Sillbrook himself.\r\n\r\n\"Been in the back room countin' up his gains, most likely,\" he muttered\r\nthickly. \"He's above standin' behind the bar nowadays.\"\r\n\r\nAmos could well remember when Sillbrook had been only a mill-hand like\r\nhimself, earning twelve dollars a week. But he had been a prudent,\r\nsaving man always, and had early made up his mind to be rich, no matter\r\nat what cost of conscience and principle. With this end in view he had\r\npurchased a saloon, and cordially invited his former fellow workers at\r\nthe mill to patronize him. This they were very willing to do, for\r\nSillbrook knew how to make his saloon attractive; and he soon had as\r\nmuch custom as he could well attend to. At length he hired a bar-keeper,\r\nand after a couple of years was never seen behind the bar himself. He\r\nhad grown rich very rapidly, and now owned one of the finest houses in\r\nthe town, and was able to gratify every taste and whim, while those who\r\nhad helped him to his wealth by drinking his liquors were as poor as\r\never--many of them poorer.\r\n\r\nAmos Derby had been one of Sillbrook's best customers ever since the\r\nsaloon had been opened, and as a natural consequence had had little to\r\nspend in comforts for his wife and children. He still lived in the small\r\ncottage he had bought on first moving to the town, and had seen it grow\r\nmore and more dilapidated every year without making any attempt to\r\nrepair it.\r\n\r\nBut though the outside was far from attractive, the inside was always\r\nneat and clean, for, whatever her faults of temper, Jane Derby was a\r\nwoman who believed thoroughly in abiding by heaven's first law, and who\r\nlabored early and late to make both ends meet, something she would not\r\nhave been able to accomplish had she not possessed skill as a\r\ndressmaker, for Amos seldom gave her any of his earnings. She was\r\nsitting in the kitchen sewing when her husband came in, and a bitter\r\nexpression crossed her face as she saw his condition.\r\n\r\n\"Drunk, as usual,\" she said, harshly, \"when were you anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you was kinder spoken, perhaps,\" answered Amos, with spirit. \"This\r\nis the sort of welcome I get every night in the week. 'Tain't much\r\nwonder I go to Sillbrook's.\" He dropped into a chair as he spoke, and\r\nbegan to pull off his boots.\r\n\r\n\"If you didn't have one excuse you'd make another,\" said Jane, flushing,\r\nand bending closer over her sewing. \"Perhaps you think I ought to feel\r\npleasant when you come home in this state. Well! it ain't human nature,\r\nthat it ain't! I mind the time you brought home your wages reg'lar,\r\nevery Sat'day night, and I was willin' enough then to speak kind to you.\r\nNow the children would starve if it wasn't for me. Where's your\r\novercoat?\" a sudden pallor creeping into her face as she asked the\r\nquestion. \"Yes! where is that overcoat?--what have you done with it that\r\nyou haven't it on--where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where d'ye s'pose?\" said Amos, roughly.\r\n\r\n\"Down at the pawn-shop, of course,\" cried his wife, angrily, \"where\r\nevery decent coat you ever had has gone. But you promised me you'd never\r\npart with this one, Amos Derby, and you've broke your word. I might have\r\nknown you would! And to think how I worked for it, and let the children\r\ndo without shoes! It's too bad! I declare it is! I gave twelve dollars\r\nfor it only a month ago, and I'll wager you let Levi have it for half o'\r\nthat. It's a shame, a dreadful shame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop that. I won't have it,\" said Amos in a threatening tone. \"There's\r\nno use whining over it now. If you say another word about it I'll go out\r\nagain, right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" said Jane, fiercely, \"and I wish it was forever! I wish I was\r\nnever to look on your face again! You're naught but a trouble and a\r\ndisgrace to us all!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Amos, as he pulled on his boots again, \"I'm goin'.\r\nI'll take you at your word. You won't see me again in a hurry; now you\r\njust mark that. A trouble and a disgrace, am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are!\" said Jane, her anger increasing as her mind dwelt upon\r\nthe loss of the coat she had worked so hard to earn. \"I mean all I've\r\nsaid, and more, too! Go! go to Sillbrook's! Ask him to show you the\r\novercoat he's wearin'. I saw it yesterday, and yours wasn't a\r\ncircumstance to it! Go! Give him every penny you've got! He needs it!\"\r\nwith a bitter little laugh. \"His children's feet are all out on the\r\nground, and his wife hasn't a decent dress to her name,\" with a glance\r\nat her faded calico gown. \"Help him all you can, Amos Derby, he's in\r\nneed o' charity.\"\r\n\r\nAmos made no answer. He was considerably more sober than when he had\r\nleft the saloon, for the walk home through the fresh winter air had done\r\nhim good, and he felt the force of his wife's words. They rung in his\r\nears as he slammed the kitchen door behind him, and, taking the road\r\nwhich led by the mill, walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nHe was soon in the heart of the town, but he did not think or care where\r\nhe was going. His only idea was to get away from the sound of Jane's\r\nsharp voice, and he turned down first one street and then another,\r\nwithout pausing, until he came to Elm Avenue, on which were situated the\r\nhandsomest houses in the town. There was a large, square brick house on\r\nthe corner, with stables in the rear, a conservatory on one side, and a\r\nbeautiful lawn in front, and this place seemed to possess some strange\r\nfascination for Amos, for he stopped suddenly at the gate and stood\r\nthere for fully five minutes, admiring, perhaps, the mansion's air of\r\nsolid comfort and wealth.\r\n\r\nThe iron gate was open, and presently, as if impelled by some impulse he\r\ncould not resist, he entered, and walking softly up the graveled path,\r\nlooked in at one of the long windows.\r\n\r\nThe room upon which he gazed was very handsomely furnished. The chairs\r\nwere luxuriously cushioned, a large mirror hung over the mantel, the\r\ncarpet was of velvet, a crystal chandelier depended from the ceiling,\r\nand a bright fire burned in the open grate, before which sat a lady\r\nrichly dressed, reading aloud to three children, sitting on ottomans at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nFor a long, long time Amos Derby stood by the window, his eyes wandering\r\nfrom one article of luxury to another, a dark frown on his face, and his\r\nteeth set hard together.\r\n\r\n\"My money,\" he muttered, when at last he turned away. \"I've given it to\r\nhim, cent by cent, and dollar by dollar, and I've naught to show for it,\r\nwhile he! he's got his fine house, and his rich carpets, and his\r\nhandsome clothes. It's the same money, only I've spent it in one way,\r\nand he in another.\"\r\n\r\nAs the last words left his lips a hand fell heavily upon his shoulder,\r\nand a voice--the voice of Sillbrook--asked him harshly what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"A look into your fine parlor,\" answered Amos roughly. \"Strange I wanted\r\nto see it, wasn't it? It ought not to matter to me, of course, what use\r\nyou make o' my money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your money!\" said Sillbrook, with a loud laugh. \"That's a crazy joke!\r\nCome, my man, you're drunk. Get out of here, or I'll have you put where\r\nyou can make your jokes to yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you're rich enough now to speak to me as you choose,\" said\r\nAmos hotly. \"Time was when you wouldn't have dared. But I tell you,\r\nJason Sillbrook, I've come to my senses to-night. It's a poor bargain\r\nwhere the gain's all on one side. We started even, and you've got all\r\nand I nothin'. But I tell you now, that, heaven helpin' me, you'll never\r\nhave another dollar o' mine to spend. You'll never buy another coat like\r\nthis out o' my money,\" and he struck in sudden passion the seal-trimmed\r\ngarment which covered Sillbrook's ample proportions.\r\n\r\n\"Be off with you,\" said the saloon-keeper. \"You're too drunk to know\r\nwhat you're talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who made me drunk? answer that question, Jason Sillbrook,\" screamed\r\nAmos.\r\n\r\n\"I'll answer nothing,\" said Sillbrook, and, tearing his coat from the\r\ngrasp Amos had laid upon it, he strode up the path and disappeared\r\nwithin the house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when the superintendent made his round of the mill, he\r\nmissed one of the machine hands.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Derby?\" he asked, angrily.\r\n\r\nNo one could answer his question. No one had seen Derby that day. And no\r\none at the mill saw him for many a day to come.\r\n\r\n\"I might have been kinder to him,\" thought Jane, when at last she became\r\nconvinced that her husband had in truth left her. \"Perhaps I did say\r\nmore'n I should at times. Poor Amos! he was no more to blame than I was,\r\nafter all. Perhaps he would have kept out o' that saloon if I'd only\r\ncoaxed 'stead o' railing at him. He wasn't bad-hearted, an' he never\r\nmeant more'n half he said.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the days went by, and she forgot her past sorrows, she had only\r\nkind thoughts of her absent husband, and blamed only herself for their\r\nmutual misery. She wished with all her heart that she could \"begin all\r\nover again,\" and try the effect of kindness and forbearance on Amos.\r\n\r\nBut no such opportunity was given her, and she had little time for\r\nbitter thoughts or unavailing regret.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the mill gave her eldest child, a lad of fourteen,\r\na situation where he could earn $4 a week, and a girl a year younger\r\nfound work in a millinery store. Thus Jane was relieved of much anxiety,\r\nand she was so skilful with her needle that she soon found herself able\r\nto \"lay by something for a rainy day,\" as she expressed it.\r\n\r\nGradually the children were provided with comfortable clothes and were\r\nsent to church and to Sunday-school, from which they had been debarred\r\nfor several years, owing to a lack of decent apparel; the house was\r\nrepaired, new furniture bought, a flower garden laid out in front of the\r\ncottage, and a new fence erected. People began to speak of Jane as a\r\nsurprisingly smart woman, and to say that her husband's desertion had\r\nbeen a blessing in disguise. But in spite of her prosperity there was an\r\nache ever at Jane's heart, and a regret which no good fortune could\r\nstifle.\r\n\r\n\"If I'd only been kinder!\" she would say to herself, as she lay awake at\r\nnight and thought of her absent husband. \"It was my fault he drank; I\r\nsee that now. He was always telling me that my temper'd ruin him in the\r\nend, and now his word's come true.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt as if she ought to make some atonement for her past sin, even\r\nthough she was never to see her husband again, and with this end in view\r\nshe determined to cure herself of the habit of scolding and\r\nfault-finding about which poor Amos had complained so bitterly.\r\n\r\nAfter a few struggles at first, she found her new path very pleasant to\r\nher feet, and was encouraged to persevere by the artless comments made\r\nby her children on the improvement in her temper.\r\n\r\n\"You're so good, now, mother,\" they would say, when, instead of the\r\nsharp rebuke they had expected on the commission of some childish folly,\r\ncame very kind words of regret and gentle reproof. \"You are so different\r\nfrom what you used to be. If father could only come home and live with\r\nus now how happy we would all be.\"\r\n\r\nBut Amos did not come. Year after year passed, and he sent no word or\r\nsign; and at length both wife and children grew to think of him as dead.\r\n\r\nSeven years! Seven years to a day had passed since Amos Derby had left\r\nhis home, and up the street and past the mill came a tall man, with a\r\ncap of sealskin pulled low over his eyes, and handsome overcoat trimmed\r\nwith the same costly fur over his arm. He whistled as he walked, and\r\nseemed in great good humor, for occasionally he would break out into a\r\nloud laugh.\r\n\r\nBut as he came near the cottage where Jane Derby lived, he became more\r\nquiet, and an anxious expression stole into his face.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if she'll know me,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\nGoing up to the window of the kitchen, he shaded his eyes with one hand\r\nand looked in.\r\n\r\nJane was setting at supper, her five children about her. The room looked\r\nwarm and comfortable. A bright fire burned in the stove, the kettle sang\r\nmerrily, and a big maltese cat dozed among some plants on the broad\r\nwindow seat.\r\n\r\nFred, the eldest son, a muscular young man of twenty-one now, was\r\nspeaking, and his words came distinctly to the ears of the watcher\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"Brooks goes to-morrow,\" he said, \"and we are to have a new\r\nsuperintendent from ----. I hope he'll have a better temper than Brooks,\r\nand I wish----Who's that?\" as a sudden knock came upon the door.\r\n\r\n\"The new superintendent,\" said the tall man, as he walked into the room\r\nand threw his overcoat on a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Jane, don't you know me?\"\r\n\r\nWith a glad cry that was almost a sob, Jane sprang forward, and was\r\nfolded in the stranger's arms.\r\n\r\n\"Children,\" she said, when she could speak, \"this is your father, come\r\nback to us at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to stay, please God,\" said Amos Derby, fervently, as in turn he\r\nembraced his children affectionately. \"Jane, you shall have no room to\r\ncomplain of me in the future. I mean to make up to you for all I made\r\nyou suffer before I found out what a fool I was to think more of my\r\nappetite than of my wife and children. Do you know what taught me my\r\nlesson?--Sillbrook's overcoat; and I've got one just like it. It will be\r\na reminder, you know. And I've something better still--the place of\r\nsuperintendent at the mills here. I've worked hard, Jane, but my reward\r\nhas come at last. When I left here I resolved never to come back until I\r\ncould make myself worthy of you and the children. I found a place in the\r\nmills at ----, and worked my way up to be superintendent. Where there's\r\na will, there's always a way, you know. I learned that you didn't need\r\nmy help, so I waited on year after year, and now----\"\r\n\r\n\"We are together, never to part again this side the grave,\" finished\r\nJane, \"Amos, God rules us all for the best. Let us thank Him for the\r\nblessings He has bestowed upon us; and then--suppose you let us see how\r\nyou look in the overcoat you've come by so justly.\"\r\n\r\nThe news that Amos Derby was the new superintendent soon flew about the\r\ntown, and great was the surprise thereat. No one was more astonished,\r\nperhaps, at the turn affairs had taken than Jason Sillbrook, and he\r\nwondered greatly at the good fortune of the man he had once so despised;\r\nbut he never knew that it was largely due to the lesson Amos had learned\r\nfrom the saloon-keeper's overcoat.--_The Christian at Work._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION CURED.\r\n\r\nAn old physician, retired from practice, having had placed in his hands\r\nby an East India missionary the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for\r\nthe speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh,\r\nAsthma and all throat and Lung Affections, also a positive and radical\r\ncure for Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having\r\ntested its wonderful curative powers in thousands of cases, has felt it\r\nhis duty to make it known to his suffering fellows.

Why, I mean that my wife's cold feet are the ones that chill me\r\nwith an Arctic region touch. Whose feet did you suppose I meant, my\r\nmother-in-law's?\" shouted the excited Crimsonbeak, darting into his gate\r\nand leaving his neighbor to his own reflections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanged Relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now that we are engaged,\" said Miss Pottleworth, \"come and let me\r\nintroduce you to papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I have met him,\" replied young Spickle.\r\n\r\n\"But in another capacity than that of son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--er, but I'd rather not meet him to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must,\" and despite the almost violent struggles of the young\r\nfellow, he was drawn into the library, where a large, red-faced man,\r\nwith a squint in one eye, and an enlargement of the nose, sat looking\r\nover a lot of papers.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" he replied, without looking up.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to present to you--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he exclaimed, looking up and catching sight of young Spickle.\r\n\"Have you the impudence to follow me here? Didn't I tell you that I\r\nwould see you to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, father, you don't know Mr. Spickle, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know his name, but I know that he has been to my office three\r\ntimes a day for the past week with a bill. I know him well enough. I\r\ncan't pay that bill to-night, young man. Come to my office to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Spickle, \"that you do not think so ill of me. I have not\r\ncome to collect the bill you have referred to, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Got another one?\"\r\n\r\n\"You persist in misunderstanding me. I did not come to collect a bill, I\r\ncan come to-morrow and see you about that. To-night I proposed to your\r\ndaughter, and have been accepted. Our mission is to acquaint you with\r\nthe fact and gain your consent to our marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the old fellow, \"is that all? Blamed if I didn't think you\r\nhad a bill. Take the girl, if that's what you want, but say, didn't I\r\ntell you to bring the bill to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't. Our relations are different now.

ALBANS, Vt., Jan. 10, 1884.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. EDITORS: The upper portion of Vermont is one of the pleasantest\r\nregions in America during the summer, and one of the bleakest during the\r\nwinter. It affords ample opportunity for the tourist, providing he\r\nchooses the proper season, but the present time is not that season.\r\nStill there are men and women here who not only endure the climate, but\r\npraise it unstintingly, and that, too, in the face of physical hardships\r\nthe most intense. The writer heard of a striking illustration of this a\r\nfew days since which is given herewith:\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Jacques is connected with the Vermont Central Railroad in the\r\ncapacity of master mason. He is well advanced in years, with a ruddy\r\ncomplexion and hale appearance, while his general bearing is such as to\r\ninstantly impress one with his strict honor and integrity. Several years\r\nago he became afflicted with most distressing troubles, which prevented\r\nthe prosecution of his duties. He was languid, and yet restless, while\r\nat times a dizziness would come over him which seemed almost blinding.\r\nHis will power was strong, and he determined not to give way to the\r\nmysterious influence which seemed undermining his life. But the pain and\r\nannoying symptoms were stronger than his will, and he kept growing\r\ngradually worse. About that time he began to notice a difficulty in\r\ndrawing on his boots, and it was by the greatest effort that he was able\r\nto force his feet into them. In this manner several weeks passed by,\r\nuntil finally one night, while in great agony, he discovered that his\r\nfeet had in a short while, swollen to enormous proportions. The balance\r\nof the narrative can best be described in his own words. He said:\r\n\r\n\"When my wife discovered the fact that I was so bloated, she sent for\r\nthe doctor immediately. He made a most careful examination and\r\npronounced me in a very serious condition. Notwithstanding his care, I\r\ngrew worse, and the swelling of my feet gradually extended upward in my\r\nbody. The top of my head pained me terribly; indeed, so badly that at\r\ntimes it seemed almost as if it would burst. My feet were painfully\r\ncold, and even when surrounded with hot flannels and irons felt as if a\r\nstrong wind were blowing on them. Next my right leg became paralyzed.\r\nThis gave me no pain, but it was exceedingly annoying. About this time I\r\nbegan to spit blood most freely, although my lungs were in perfect\r\ncondition, and I knew it did not come from them. My physicians were\r\ncareful and untiring in their attentions, but unable to relieve my\r\nsufferings. My neighbors and friends thought I was dying and many called\r\nto see me, fully twenty-five on a single Sunday that I now recall. At\r\nlast my agony seemed to culminate in the most intense, sharp pains I\r\nhave ever known or heard of. If red hot knives sharpened to the highest\r\ndegree had been run through my body constantly they could not have hurt\r\nme worse. I would spring up in bed, sometimes as much as three feet, cry\r\nout in my agony and long for death. One night the misery was so intense\r\nthat I arose and attempted to go into the next room, but was unable to\r\nlift my swollen feet above the little threshold that obstructed them. I\r\nfell back upon the bed and gasped in my agony, but felt unable even to\r\nbreathe. It seemed like death.\r\n\r\n\"Several years ago Rev. Dr. J. E. Rankin, now of Washington, was\r\nstationed here as pastor of the Congregational church. We all admired\r\nand respected him, and my wife remembered seeing somewhere that he had\r\nspoken in the highest terms of a preparation which had cured some of his\r\nintimate friends. We determined to try this remedy, accordingly sent for\r\nit, and, to make a long story short, it completely restored my health,\r\nbrought me back from the grave, and I owe all I have in the way of\r\nhealth and strength to Warner's Safe Cure, better known as Warner's Safe\r\nKidney and Liver Cure. I am positive that if I had taken this medicine\r\nwhen I felt the first symptoms above described, I might have avoided all\r\nthe agony I afterward endured, to say nothing of the narrow escape I had\r\nfrom death.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that all possible facts bearing upon the subject might be\r\nknown, I called on Dr. Oscar F. Fassett, who was for nineteen years\r\nUnited States Examining Surgeon, and who attended Mr. Jacques during his\r\nsickness. He stated that Mr. Jacques had a most pronounced case of\r\nAlbuminuria or Bright's disease of the kidneys. That an analysis showed\r\nthe presence of albumen and casts in great abundance and that he was in\r\na condition where few if any ever recover. His recovery was due to\r\nWarner's Safe Cure.\r\n\r\nMr. John W. Hobart, General Manager of the Vermont Central railroad,\r\nstated that Mr. Jacques was one of the best and most faithful of his\r\nemployes, that his sickness had been an exceedingly severe one and the\r\ncompany were not only glad to again have his services, but grateful to\r\nthe remedy that had cured so valuable a man.\r\n\r\nMr. James M. Foss, assistant superintendent and master mechanic of the\r\nVermont Central railroad, is also able to confirm this.\r\n\r\nI do not claim to be a great discoverer, but I do think I have found in\r\nthe above a most remarkable case and knowing the unusual increase of\r\nBright's disease feel that the public should have the benefit of it. It\r\nseems to me a remedy that can accomplish so much in the last stages\r\nought do even more for the first approach of this deceptive yet terrible\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nF.

A firm which has\r\npurchased a large share of the claims at 5 per cent offers $330,000 for\r\nthe property remaining, but other creditors hold out for $400,000.\r\n\r\nJudge Shepard, in the Superior Court of Chicago, Saturday, dismissed\r\nthree bills for divorce, holding that when a wife separated from her\r\nhusband her residence as well as her domicile follows his, and that the\r\nIllinois statutes excludes from its courts all suits for divorce in\r\nbehalf of persons not legal residents.\r\n\r\nThe Onondaga (New York) Indians have held another council, at which it\r\nwas shown that a majority of the nation is opposed to dividing the lands\r\nin severally, but is willing to agree to a division of such timber lands\r\nas can not be protected against depredations. The Christian party is to\r\nbe represented at the next conference with the State commissioners.\r\n\r\nNearly one-fourth of the business portion of Leipsic, O., was burned\r\nFriday night, and flames swept away 1,145 bales of cotton at Murrell's\r\nPoint, La., and twenty-one buildings at Lowell, Mich. A boiler explosion\r\nat Cincinnati, in the Corrugating company's manufactory, Saturday, led\r\nto the destruction of $50,000 in property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMARKETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF THE PRAIRIE FARMER.}\r\nCHICAGO. Jan 22, 1884.       }\r\n\r\nPapers devoted to finance and trade inform us that the number of\r\nbusiness failures in 1883 was 9,184 against 8,782 in the hard times of\r\n1877. The fear is, that the worst is not yet come, but this feeling\r\nhappily is not by any means universal among most far seeing business\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe transactions at the Chicago banks were a trifle slower than last\r\nweek. The regular loan market was quotable on Monday at 6@7 per cent.\r\n\r\nEastern exchange was firm at 60c per $1,000.\r\n\r\nThe stock markets at the East were a little feverish and here the same\r\nfeeling was noticeable. There are rumors of financial embarrassment in\r\nhigh places, and Mr. Gould himself is said to be a little nervous over\r\nthe weakness in many of his stocks.\r\n\r\nGovernment securities are as follows:\r\n\r\n4's coupon, 1907                 |Q.

Shipped.\r\nCattle                                42,110    18,986\r\nCalves                                   527       346\r\nHogs                                 140,814    34,161\r\nSheep                                 24,600    11,815\r\n\r\nCATTLE.--Very few choice lots are coming in. Receipts have fallen off\r\nsome 3,000 head. Of those that arrive the \"unripe\" predominate. Some of\r\nour feeders are undoubtedly inclined to market too young. Some cattle by\r\nexperienced breeders and feeders may be \"ripened\" at two years, but in\r\nthe majority of cases, especially with anything else than high grade\r\nshort-horns, this can not be done. There is more money in holding common\r\nstock a few months longer. The feeling on Monday was very firm, and\r\nprices advanced considerably. Good heavy cattle brought as high as\r\n$6 65, though the majority sold at less. Six steers averaging 1,523 lbs\r\nbrought $7. Cattle for shippers and canners went at $4 65@5; bulls\r\n$2 50@4; cows $2 25@4 75; stockers and feeders scarce at $3 40@4 45 with\r\nsome of the latter at $4 50@5.\r\n\r\nHOGS.--The hogs now arriving are light and the number is not large.\r\nSince November 1st, Chicago packers have put up 325,000 less hogs than\r\nfor the corresponding period last year, and the total packing of the\r\ncountry has fallen off 285,000 head. Our packing houses are now running\r\nto about one half their capacity. Prices are firm. Common to fair stock\r\n$5 25@5 75; good to choice heavy $5 80@6 30; skips and culls $4 25@5 15.\r\n\r\nNote.--All sales of hogs are made subject to a shrinkage of 40 lbs for\r\npiggy sows and 80 lbs for stags. Dead hogs sell for 1-1/2c per lb for\r\nweights of 200 and over and [Transcriber's Note: blank in original] for\r\nweights of less than 100 lbs.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.--Arrivals are large.
