In sections where it\r\nsucceeds, crimson clover can be sown following a grain crop or in an\r\nintertilled crop in late summer and will mature a hay crop the following\r\nspring in time to plow the land for spring-seeded crops, such as corn or\r\ncotton. It may even be held for seed as far north as central Delaware\r\nand the stubble be plowed under in time for seeding the quick-maturing\r\nstrains of corn. It may be turned under for soil improvement when only 6\r\ninches high if it Is desired to fit the land for early spring-seeded crops\r\nEven if only the stubble be turned under, the effect upon the succeeding\r\ncrop will be marked, especially if the soil be deficient in nitrogenous\r\nfertilizers. The plowing under of the entire plant, however, will more\r\nrapidly correct any deficiency of nitrates or humus in the soil. It is\r\none of the best cover crops for use in orchards and, in fact, under any\r\nconditions where the soil is likely to wash during the winter months. The\r\nmany uses to which this crop may be put merit a careful study of the best\r\nmethods of establishing ii stand of crimson clover upon a farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=HISTORY AND PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover (fig. 1) is frequently called \"Scarlet clover\" and,\r\nsomewhat loss commonly, \"German clover,\" \"Italian clover,\" \"French\r\nclover,\" \"Incarnate clover,\" \"Annual clover,\" etc. It occurs wild in\r\nEngland and in eastern and southern Europe and is grown as a forage and\r\nsoil-improving crop in Italy, France, Germany, Austria, and Great Britain.\r\nIt was introduced into this country as early as 1822, but was grown only\r\nto a very limited extent until about 1880. It has proved especially\r\nadapted to the lighter, sandy soils of the eastern part of the United\r\nStates where the winters are not too severe.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Atlantic States it is also grown to a considerable extent on\r\nthe clay soils of the Piedmont section.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan it is sometimes used on the sandy soils as a cover crop in\r\npeach orchards, although it frequently winterkills. It can not ordinarily\r\nsurvive the severe winters of the Northern States.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] In such northern sections where a fall-seeded legume is desired it is\r\nsuggested that hairy vetch seeded with rye be used instead. See Farmers'\r\nBulletin 515, entitled \"Vetches.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A single plant of crimson clover.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is a \"winter annual,\" that is, it ordinarily makes its\r\nearly growth in the autumn, passes the winter in a somewhat dormant but\r\ngreen state, makes a very early spring growth, and matures its seed and\r\ndies before summer. It makes little or no growth in very hot weather and\r\ntherefore should not be sown in the spring, except in the extreme North,\r\nwhere it may make a satisfactory growth by autumn, so that & hay crop may\r\nbe taken from it at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING A STAND OF CRIMSON\r\nCLOVER.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless the conditions of soil and moisture are exactly right it is not an\r\neasy matter to establish a satisfactory stand of crimson clover, even in\r\nthe sections where it is most extensively produced. (Fig. 2.) The lack of\r\ntimely rains in late summer is responsible for most of the failures to\r\nobtain a satisfactory stand. The young seedlings are very easily killed\r\nby the hot sun or lack of moisture. On the other hand, if the seeding be\r\ndelayed too long, as, for instance, in waiting for the proper conditions\r\nof soil moisture, the plants will be unable to make sufficient growth to\r\nwithstand the winter. Briefly speaking, crimson clover should be seeded\r\nshallow on a moist, reasonably fertile, well-drained, well-settled seed\r\nbed. Inoculation in some form should be provided, especially when seeding\r\nit for the first time on any fields in sections comparatively new to this\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--A crimson-clover failure on ground too poor in\r\nhumus.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is not adapted to the white-clay lands in their present\r\ncondition in some portions of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Such fields\r\nshould be seeded to soy beans or cowpeas when a leguminous crop is\r\ndesired for soil improvement or other purposes.[2] Crimson clover does\r\nnot do well on rough, newly cleared land and it ordinarily requires\r\nthe production of two or three crops or a special preparation by liming,\r\nmanuring, and inoculating before such land presents conditions\r\nsatisfactory for seeding. It is usually better to sow rye for a winter\r\ncover and cowpeas for a summer crop if a cover crop is thought to be\r\nneeded. In any section where crimson clover has not been previously grown\r\nthe first seeding should be on a small scale to determine whether or not\r\nit is a practicable crop for the locality in question.\r\n\r\n[2] These white-clay soils are nearly always sour, deficient In humus, and\r\npoorly drained. If limed, subsoiled, drained, and supplied with humus,\r\nsuch soils are said to grow crimson clover satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.=\r\n\r\nThe seed bed for crimson clover should be firm, moist, well settled,\r\nand fine on top. Any efforts that may be expended to conserve the soil\r\nmoisture previous to seeding are usually justified, especially if there\r\nbe any lack of rainfall during the month previous or the month following\r\nseeding. Where the clover is seeded in an intertilled crop, such as\r\ncorn, cotton, or tomatoes, the customary cultivation received by these\r\ncrops is ordinarily sufficient for the needs of crimson clover. Where\r\ngrain-stubble land is plowed in preparation for the clover a month or six\r\nweeks are ordinarily required for the soil to settle sufficiently to make\r\na proper seed bed, since after plowing at least one soaking rain, which\r\ncompacts the soil and fills it with moisture, is essential to the proper\r\npreparation of the seed bed for crimson clover. If the ground be disked,\r\na much shorter time and less rain are required for the proper settling of\r\nthe seed bed. The best method of retaining the moisture in the seed bed\r\nis to harrow or give shallow cultivation shortly after each rain. A fine\r\nsoil mulch on the surface will largely prevent the soil just beneath the\r\nsurface from losing its moisture through evaporation. Such surface tillage\r\nshould, of course, be given before seeding the crimson clover.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FERTILIZERS FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinary conditions of soil fertility the fertilizer applied to\r\nthe preceding crop is sufficient for the needs of crimson clover. This\r\nis especially true where the clover follows such crops as potatoes or\r\ntomatoes, which are ordinarily heavily treated with fertilizers that are\r\nnot entirely used up by these crops. It is important to realize, however,\r\nthat crimson clover has a very short period of growth and that to make a\r\nvigorous growth it must have a good supply of plant food. On sandy soils\r\nwhere there has been no recent application of fertilizers it is often the\r\npractice to apply from 200 to 400 pounds of a mixture of equal parts of\r\nacid phosphate and kainite. On clay soils 300 or 400 pounds per acre of\r\nacid phosphate are ordinarily sufficient. If the soil be low in nitrates a\r\nlight application of nitrate of soda will assist materially in giving the\r\nyoung clover plants a good start and winter which otherwise might have\r\nproved fatal to the stand. If the seeding has been delayed, as by waiting\r\nfor suitable rains, an application of nitrate fertilizer will stimulate\r\nthe young plants and enable them to make an increased growth before winter.\r\n\r\nAny direct application of fertilizer is usually made at seeding time, but\r\nsome few farmers have been found who apply it as a top dressing very early\r\nthe following spring, giving as a reason that there is no loss from winter\r\nleaching and that the plants are by this method nourished at the time they\r\nare making their most vigorous growth. Such top dressings of fertilizer\r\nshould not be made while the leaves are wet with rain or dew. Where stable\r\nmanure is applied to crimson clover very marked results follow. It may be\r\nspread just before seeding, when the clover is not grown in an intertilled\r\ncrop, or it may be applied as a top dressing in winter or very early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe more vigorous the growth that can be induced by the application of\r\nsuitable fertilizers the more marked will be the increase in the yield\r\nof the succeeding crops. On soil not well supplied with humus or plant\r\nfood the use of a reasonable amount of fertilizer will often enable a\r\nsuccessful crop of clover and succeeding crops to be produced where,\r\nhad not the fertilizers been applied, the clover would have failed.\r\nFurthermore, the following crop, particularly if it be corn, would also\r\nfail to give the increased yield which follows a successful stand of\r\ncrimson clover.\r\n\r\nAn application of barnyard manure will be found to be especially effective\r\nin obtaining a stand of crimson clover on any thin, galled spots in the\r\nfield. The manure should be worked into the ground and, if possible, a\r\nsecond application as a top dressing should be given such thin places to\r\npartially shade the ground from the August sun while the seedlings are\r\nestablishing themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=LIMING SOILS FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\nMost of the soils in the crimson-clover sections will be found to be\r\nbenefited by liming. Crimson clover, however, does not appear to require\r\nlime to the extent that red clover does. Frequently on well-drained soils\r\nin a good state of fertility the crimson clover makes a vigorous growth\r\nwithout the use of lime. The stands are, however, usually more uniformly\r\ngood over the limed parts of such fields than on the parts that have\r\nreceived no line. The opinion among individual farmers appears to be about\r\nequally divided as to whether or not it pays them to lime their soils\r\nfor crimson clover. In considering the advisability of applying lime one\r\nmust not lose sight of the need of lime on the part of such other crops\r\nas cantaloupes or peaches, which require lime and which are either grown\r\nwith the clover or follow it. Inasmuch as the extent of the benefit is\r\nsomewhat uncertain it is suggested that the particular requirements of\r\nthe farm in question be determined by liming small plats at different\r\nrates before any considerable areas are limed. The most profitable rate of\r\napplication can then be adopted for the whole acreage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=INOCULATION FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\nFortunately most of the soils in the crimson-clover sections appear to\r\nbe already inoculated. This is especially true in sandy soil areas where\r\ncrimson clover has been grown for a number of seasons. In sections new to\r\nthis crop inoculation in some form is usually necessary. On clay soils\r\ninoculation is not always present, even though crimson clover may have\r\nbeen grown, for a number of successive seasons on other fields of the farm.\r\n\r\nAn experiment conducted by the Alabama State Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation shows how essential inoculation is on soils which have not\r\npreviously grown crimson clover. In this experiment a yield of 4,057\r\npounds of crimson clover hay was secured where the plants were inoculated,\r\nas compared with only 761 pounds where no inoculation was provided. In\r\nanother test by the same station the inoculated plat of crimson clover\r\nyielded at the rate of 6,100 pounds of cured hay per acre, while the\r\nuninoculated plat was a total failure.\r\n\r\nInoculation by the use of soil from a crimson-clover field is considerably\r\nmore certain than is inoculation by the use of pure cultures, but soil\r\ninoculation is open to the danger of introducing noxious weeds, insects,\r\nand plant diseases, especially if the soil is brought from a distance.\r\nThere is much less danger in this respect if soil from inoculated plants\r\ncan be obtained in the same neighborhood. One very practicable method is\r\nto apply a bottle of pure culture[3] to a pound or two of the seed and sow\r\nthis in the corner of some field, or even in the garden. The resulting\r\nplants will be quite sure to be inoculated and will furnish an abundant\r\nsupply of soil for inoculating much larger areas at the next seeding. Care\r\nmust be taken not to allow the sun to shine upon either the pure cultures\r\nor the soil, or even on the seed after it is broadcasted. For this\r\nreason it is safest to seed on a cloudy day or after sundown. One very\r\nsatisfactory method of soil inoculation consists merely in mixing together\r\nequal parts of the proper soil and seed and sowing immediately in front of\r\nthe covering harrow.\r\n\r\n[3] Pure cultures are sent free by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.\r\nFull instructions for using them accompany each bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be sown broadcast, by hand, with a wheel-barrow\r\n\"sheep-trough\" seeder, or with any of the familiar types of rotary\r\nseeders. It is sometimes drilled in and there are a number of specially\r\nconstructed drills designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe consensus of opinion among farmers is that shallow seeding is\r\ngenerally best, especially upon the clay soils. An inch in sandy soils and\r\nhalf an inch in clay soils appears to be about the right depth except in\r\ntimes of drought.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary rate of seeding is 15 pounds per acre, although some use 20\r\npounds, while others are able to obtain satisfactory stands with only 12\r\npounds per acre. One pound of seed per acre provides for three seeds for\r\nevery square foot; hence, if every seed produced a plant, 2 pounds per\r\nacre would be theoretically sufficient to secure a satisfactory stand.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, however, it is necessary to allow for some\r\nof the seed being covered too deep, while a considerable proportion may\r\nprove to be covered too shallow for successful growth. The principal\r\njustification of seeding such a quantity and at varying depths lies in\r\nthe fact that in case a dry season develops after seeding the more deeply\r\ncovered seeds will be able to withstand the drought better than those\r\ncovered to a medium depth. If an unusually wet season develops, the\r\nshallow-planted seeds will give the best results. Moreover, some of the\r\nseed will fail to germinate. It is also well to have a fairly thick stand\r\nof the young plants, so that the ground may be well covered even during\r\nearly fall, and thus prevent the winter-growing weeds from establishing\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is held by many farmers that they are more certain of getting a stand\r\nof crimson clover if they sow the seed in the hull rather than use the\r\nhulled seed as it ordinarily appears on the market. It is claimed that\r\nthe hulls hold the moisture to some extent. Seed in the hull can easily\r\nbe obtained by flailing out a load of crimson clover which has been left\r\nuncut in the field until the seed is mature. Many farmers run the clover\r\nthrough an ordinary grain thrasher, which delivers the seed in the hull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=VARIOUS METHODS OF SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be seeded in late summer in any of the ordinary\r\nintertilled crops. It may be seeded alone following any farm crop which\r\ncan be removed from the land by early summer, so that the seed can be\r\nsown in late summer or very early fall. It may also be seeded for hay in\r\nmixture with grain, such as wheat, rye, barley, or winter oats, which are\r\nready to cut for hay at about the same time as the clover the following\r\nspring. A very light seeding of an animal catch crop, such as buckwheat,\r\nmay be made with crimson clover in time for the catch crop to make its\r\ngrowth before winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER IN INTERTILLED CROPS.=\r\n\r\nAlthough crimson clover may be seeded in almost any of the intertilled\r\ncrops, in this country probably half of it is sown in corn at or shortly\r\nafter the time of the last cultivation. (Fig. 3.) It is usually possible\r\nto make such a seeding, obtain a good growth during the fall and early\r\nspring, and mature a crop of hay in time for breaking up the land for\r\nanother crop of corn. South of the latitude of central Delaware it is even\r\npossible to mature a crop of clover seed in time for corn planting. In\r\nthis way it is possible to grow a crop of corn each year and at the same\r\ntime steadily increase the fertility of the soil for a series of years.\r\nTreated in this manner each succeeding crop of corn can ordinarily be\r\nmaterially increased. Instances are reported where the yield of corn has\r\nbeen gradually increased by this means from 10 bushels per acre at the\r\nstart until as high as 70 bushels per acre were secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Seeding crimson clover in corn at the\r\nlast cultivation.]\r\n\r\nThe newly seeded stands of clover in corn are likely to perish if drought\r\noccurs at or after seeding time. Tho growing corn makes heavy demands on\r\nthe soil moisture, and if there is not enough moisture for both clover and\r\ncorn the latter gets the larger share and the tender clover plants are\r\nlikely to succumb. It sometimes happens that a very light rain shortly\r\nafter seeding the clover will cause the seeds to germinate, only to perish\r\nduring the succeeding days of dry weather. On account of the competition\r\nfor moisture between the corn and clover it is best to cover the clover\r\nseed a little deeper than is necessary when it is sown on fallow land.\r\n\r\nNorth, of the Potomac River the last cultivation of the corn comes at\r\nabout the right time for the best results with clover seeded at the same\r\ntime. Farther south, however, there is too much hot weather after the corn\r\nis laid by, and as a consequence it is best to delay the seeding of the\r\ncrimson clover until about 8 or 10 weeks before the first frost may be\r\nexpected. A light furrow-toothed cultivator or harrow may be run shallow\r\nbetween the rows to cover the seed. The seed may be sown broadcast by hand\r\nor even from horseback with a rotary seeder. In such an event, however, it\r\nis necessary to cover the ears of the horse with small bags or socks to\r\nprevent the entrance of the flying seed. A much more even stand is made\r\npossible if the corn is given level tillage rather than the ridged tillage\r\nincident to plowing with a 1-horse corn plow and ridging the land. The\r\nappearance of a field of crimson clover seeded the summer previous in corn\r\nis indicated in figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Crimson clover in an old cornfield. The clover\r\nwas seeded in the corn at the last cultivation. A fodder stack is to be\r\nobserved in the middle foreground. The cornstalks have been removed to\r\navoid difficulty in mowing the clover.]\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina and southern Virginia it has been found possible under\r\nfavorable conditions to obtain a satisfactory stand of clover by seeding\r\nin cotton. The clover should not be sown until 10 or 12 weeks before frost\r\nand the last working of the cotton comes ordinarily at an earlier date\r\nthan this. It is necessary that the cotton be given very clean culture,\r\nas well as special attention paid to conserving the moisture in the\r\nprospective clover-seed bed. Unless the first show of cotton is picked\r\nearly it is difficult to cover the clover seed without unduly injuring the\r\nopened cotton bolls. In the higher and more northern parts of the cotton\r\nbelt it is possible to make the clover seeding before the bolls begin to\r\nburst.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be seeded in practically any of the cultivated truck\r\ncrops which receive their last cultivation from 8 to 12 weeks before the\r\nfirst frost. It is not practicable to seed the clover in late potatoes,\r\nas the digging of the potatoes in the fall practically destroys the stand\r\nof clover. The heavy application of fertilizers necessary for the truck\r\ncrop makes possible a vigorous growth of the clover. The result is that\r\nthe soil is materially built up in both nitrogen and humus. The clover\r\nmakes its growth at a season of the year when the land is not ordinarily\r\noccupied by any of the regular truck crops.\r\n\r\nWhen timely rains follow the seeding it is possible to seed the clover\r\non the surface of the ground among cantaloupe vines and allow the first\r\nrain to cover the seed. The shade is apparently too dense under watermelon\r\nvines for the clover seedlings to survive. The writer has obtained a good\r\nstand by seeding the clover seed, without covering, in sweet potatoes the\r\nfirst week in August on sandy land near Washington, D. C. By hand-digging\r\nthe potatoes with a spade a fair stand of the clover plants was left\r\nunharmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER AFTER EARLY-MATURING CROPS.=\r\n\r\nIt is possible to seed crimson clover after practically any of the\r\nordinary farm crops which can be removed from the land three months before\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to obtain anything like an ideal seed bed for\r\ncrimson clover where a field of grain stubble has been plowed under. The\r\nsoil in a stubble field is apt to be dry and cloddy when plowed, while\r\nthe stubble tends to form a dry mat at the bottom of each furrow. Such a\r\ncondition is likely to continue for a number of weeks after plowing and\r\nto result disastrously to the clover seedlings unless there be abundant\r\nand frequent rains. It is ordinarily a better practice to disk the grain\r\nstubble and harrow every week, or at least after every rain, in order to\r\nsettle the ground and assist in holding the moisture pending the time of\r\nseeding. Such frequent harrowings will also kill the successive crops of\r\ngerminating weed seeds, which might otherwise injure the young stand of\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ground from which early potatoes have been removed\r\nis very favorable for the establishment of a stand of crimson clover.\r\nThe residual effect of the fertilizers used on the potatoes is partially\r\nresponsible for this, while the well-settled seed bed, which requires\r\nonly leveling and harrowing, also presents favorable conditions for the\r\ncrimson-clover seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER WITH LATE SUMMER-SEEDED ANNUAL CROPS.=\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be seeded in midsummer or in late summer with a very\r\nlight seeding of buckwheat. The buckwheat soon forms an ideal shade for\r\nthe young clover plants and unless frosts occur very early a crop of\r\nbuckwheat may usually be harvested. This method has been suggested as\r\nbeing applicable when seeding the clover in cotton. If the buckwheat\r\nis not seeded until August it will not ordinarily produce seed in the\r\nlatitude of Washington, D. C. Wherever possible, the seeding of buckwheat\r\nand crimson clover should be made so early that there will be time for the\r\nbuckwheat to mature its seed crop, as in this way the buckwheat itself\r\nwill pay for the expense of starting both stands. A light seeding of the\r\nbuckwheat must be made, as an ordinary stand of buckwheat shades the\r\nground so completely as to destroy the crimson clover.\r\n\r\nAnother method of preventing the injurious effect of the hot sun of\r\nlate summer is to make a light seeding of cowpeas at the same time that\r\nthe crimson clover is seeded. The cowpeas germinate promptly, and being\r\nrather thin on the ground do not injure the stand of clover, but on the\r\ncontrary afford sufficient shade to prevent the soil from becoming as\r\nhot as it otherwise would. In addition, the clover plants receive some\r\nprotection from the direct rays of the sun. There is ordinarily not enough\r\ntime for the cowpeas to mature, so they are either mown for hay or left\r\nstanding to catch the snow during the winter and protect the stand of\r\nclover. In seedlings made by the writer half a bushel of cowpeas per acre,\r\nbroadcasted, gave vary satisfactory results, the seeding being made August\r\n1 on sandy ground near Washington, D. C. The clover and cowpeas were sown\r\nbroadcast on early-potato ground and covered from one-half to 1 inch deep.\r\n\r\nIf a light seeding of turnips be made with the clover, the turnip plants\r\nwill afford some protection to the young clover plants and at the same\r\ntime will ordinarily yield a fair crop of turnips. About 1 pound of turnip\r\nseed and 15 pounds of clover seed should be sown to the acre. If the\r\nseeding of turnips be at all heavy the coarse-growing turnip plants will\r\nchoke out too many of the clover plants. The Cow Horn turnips appear to be\r\nespecially adapted for seeding with crimson clover.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CRIMSON CLOVER IN MIXTURES WITH OTHER LEGUMES AND GRAIN.=\r\n\r\nWhen crimson clover is seeded alone on good soil it is likely to make so\r\nrank a growth as to lodge. To overcome this difficulty it is a common\r\npractice to seed some small-grain crop with the clover at seeding time.\r\nSouth of the Potomac River winter oats are ordinarily very satisfactory,\r\nespecially when seeded with the late white-blooming strain of crimson\r\nclover. In Delaware and eastern Maryland wheat is commonly used. In\r\naddition to wheat and oats, rye or barley is sometimes used. The customary\r\nrate of seeding is about 15 pounds of clover seed and 30 pounds of grain\r\nper acre. The accompanying illustration (fig. 5) indicates the appearance\r\nof a field seeded to a mixture of crimson clover and wheat. The grain\r\nprevents the clover from lodging, facilitates the curing of the clover\r\nhay, and, in addition, forms a valuable constituent of the resulting hay\r\ncrop. The yield of the mixture is ordinarily somewhat more than when the\r\nclover is seeded alone. The Alabama State Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nsecured as the average for two years' experiments the following yields of\r\nhay:\r\n\r\n                                                Yield per acre.\r\n\r\n  Crimson clover seeded alone                     2,836 pounds.\r\n  Crimson clover seeded in mixtures:\r\n      Barley and crimson clover                   3,695 pounds.\r\n      Wheat and crimson clover                    3,771 pounds.\r\n      Oats and crimson clover                     4,228 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Crimson clover and wheat in mixture. In the\r\nforeground the crop has been cut and fed green to stock. The remainder\r\nwas cut the next day for hay. The grain prevents the crimson clover from\r\nlodging.]\r\n\r\nThe grain is usually well headed but is in the milk or soft-dough stage\r\nwhen the clover is ready to cut. The presence of the grain hay makes the\r\nclover hay more easily cured. With winter oats it is usually best to seed\r\nthe late white-blooming variety of crimson clover, as the oat crop matures\r\nsomewhat later than the ordinary crimson clover. Another advantage of this\r\nmixture is that if either should fail the other will be present to serve\r\nas a cover crop during winter and bring some return the following spring.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be seeded in mixtures with vetch, shaftal clover,\r\ntrefoil, or, in fact, any winter-growing legume which has a growing season\r\nsimilar to crimson clover. Since most of these legumes are not upright in\r\ntheir growth it is usually necessary to seed some grain crop with them\r\nto serve as a support and to prevent the plants from lodging. The grain\r\nis ordinarily a surer crop than the legumes and practically insures the\r\nground being covered with some crop during the winter and spring months.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER ALONE.=\r\n\r\nIf a good seed bed can be prepared by August 1 in the latitude of\r\nWashington, D. C., crimson clover will ordinarily produce a satisfactory\r\nstand if seeded entirely alone. This is especially true on the clay\r\nsoils, where it is often difficult to obtain a successful catch in corn\r\nat the last working. The seed is sown at the same rate as when seeded\r\nin corn, namely, about 15 pounds per acre. It is the common practice to\r\nbroadcast the seed and to cover with a very light barrow or weeder. Unless\r\nthe August sun be unduly hot and a drought develops, such seeding will\r\nordinarily produce very satisfactory results if the soil be reasonably\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=TREATMENT OF CRIMSON CLOVER STANDS AFTER SEEDING.=\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinarily no special treatment is required after seeding, and before\r\nwinter comes on some fall pasturage may be obtained if the growth be\r\nsufficiently rank. A light pasturing with sheep has been noted to induce\r\nheavier stooling on the part of the crimson clover. Only a light pasturing\r\nwith small animals, such as sheep, calves, or chickens, should be made in\r\neither the fall or spring before the early spring growth is well under\r\nway. If the time of seeding has been delayed, or if for any reason it is\r\nfeared that the plants will be unable to make sufficient growth before\r\ncold weather, it has been found that a top dressing of nitrate of soda\r\nalone or in mixture with muriato of potash will greatly hasten the fall\r\ngrowth. This reduces the danger from winterkilling and heaving out in the\r\nearly spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transcriber Note=\r\n\r\nMinor typos have been corrected.
