It has no\r\npretensions to be considered a complete treatise on the subject. On the\r\ncontrary, its aim is strictly elementary, and with this view I have\r\nendeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid unnecessary technicalities so\r\nas to make it intelligible to those who are unacquainted with the\r\ndetails of chemical science, although I have not hesitated to discuss\r\nsuch points as appeared essential to the proper understanding of any\r\nparticular subject.\r\n\r\nThe rapid progress of agricultural chemistry, and the numerous\r\nresearches prosecuted under the auspices of agricultural societies and\r\nprivate experimenters in this and other countries, render it by no means\r\nan easy task to make a proper selection from the mass of facts which is\r\nbeing daily accumulated. In doing this, however, I have been guided by a\r\npretty intimate knowledge of the wants of the farmer, which has induced\r\nme to enlarge on those departments of the subject which bear more\r\nimmediately on the every-day practice of agriculture; and for this\r\nreason the composition and properties of soils, the nature of manures,\r\nand the principles by which their application ought to be governed, have\r\nbeen somewhat minutely treated.\r\n\r\nIn all cases numerical details have been given as fully as is consistent\r\nwith the limits of the work; and it may be right to state that a\r\nconsiderable number of the analyses contained in it have been made in my\r\nown laboratory, and that even when I have preferred to quote the results\r\nof other chemists, they have not unfrequently been confirmed by my own\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n     UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW,\r\n     _1st November 1860._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                       Page\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                              1\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nCarbon ...

These opinions, which were little better than hypotheses, and\r\nfounded on very imperfect chemical data, are mentioned by Jethro Tull,\r\nthe father of modern agriculture, only to deny their accuracy; and he\r\ncontended that the plants absorb and digest the finer particles of the\r\nearth, and attributed the success of the particular system of husbandry\r\nhe advocated to the comminution of the soil, by which a larger number\r\nof its particles are rendered sufficiently small to permit their ready\r\nabsorption by the roots. Popular opinion at that time was in favour of\r\nthe mechanical rather than the chemical explanation of agricultural\r\nfacts, and Tull's work had the effect of confirming this opinion, and\r\nturning attention away from the application of chemistry to agriculture.\r\nIndeed, no good results could have followed its study at that time, for\r\nchemistry, especially in those departments bearing more immediately on\r\nagriculture, was much too imperfect, and it was only towards the close\r\nof the last century, when Lavoisier established its true principles,\r\nthat it became possible to pursue it with any prospect of success.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Lavoisier's system was made known, Lord Dundonald\r\npublished his \"Treatise on the Intimate Connexion between Chemistry and\r\nAgriculture,\" in which the important bearings of the recent chemical\r\ndiscoveries on the practice of agriculture were brought prominently\r\nunder the notice of the farmer, and almost at the same time De Saussure\r\ncommenced those remarkable researches, which extended over a long series\r\nof years, and laid the foundation of almost all our accurate knowledge\r\nof the chemistry of vegetation. Saussure traced with singular care and\r\naccuracy the whole phenomena of the life of plants, and indicated the\r\nmode in which the facts he established might be taken advantage of in\r\nimproving the cultivation of the soil. But neither his researches, nor\r\nLord Dundonald's more direct appeal to the farmer, excited the attention\r\nthey deserved, or produced any immediate effect on the progress of\r\nagriculture. It was not till the year 1812 that the interest of\r\npractical men was fairly awakened by a course of lectures given by Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, at the instance of Sir John Sinclair, who was at that\r\ntime president of the Board of Agriculture. In these lectures, written\r\nwith all the clearness and precision which characterised their author's\r\nstyle, the results of De Saussure's experiments were for the first time\r\npresented to the farmer in a form in which they could be easily\r\nunderstood by him, the conclusions to which they led were distinctly\r\nindicated, and a number of useful practical suggestions made, many of\r\nwhich have been adopted into every-day practice, and become so\r\nthoroughly incorporated with it, that their scientific origin has been\r\naltogether forgotten. A lively interest was excited by the publication\r\nof Davy's work, but it soon died out, and the subject lay in almost\r\ncomplete abeyance for a considerable number of years. Nor could any\r\nother result be well expected, for at that time agriculture was not ripe\r\nfor chemistry, nor chemistry ripe for agriculture. The necessities of a\r\nrapidly increasing population had not yet begun to compel the farmer to\r\nuse every means adapted to increase the amount of production to its\r\nutmost limit; and though the fundamental principles of chemistry had\r\nbeen established, its details, especially in that department which\r\ntreats of the constituents of plants and animals, were very imperfectly\r\nknown. It is not surprising, therefore, that matters should have\r\nremained almost unchanged for the comparatively long period of nearly\r\nthirty years. Indeed, with the exception of the investigation of soils\r\nby Schuebler, and some other inquiries of minor importance, and which, in\r\nthis country at least, excited no attention on the part of the\r\nagriculturist, nothing was done until the year 1840, when Liebig\r\npublished his treatise on _Chemistry, in its application to Agriculture\r\nand Physiology_.\r\n\r\nSaussure's researches formed the main groundwork of Liebig's treatise,\r\nas they had before done for Davy's; but the progress of science had\r\nsupplied many new facts which confirmed the opinions of the older\r\nchemists in most respects, and enabled Liebig to generalise with greater\r\nconfidence, and illustrate more fully the principles upon which\r\nchemistry ought to be applied to agriculture. Few works have ever\r\nproduced a more profound impression. Written in a clear and forcible\r\nstyle, dealing with scientific truths in a bold and original manner, and\r\nproducing a strong impression, as well by its earnestness as by the\r\nimportance of its conclusions, it was received by the agricultural\r\npublic with the full conviction that the application of its principles\r\nwas to be immediately followed by the production of immensely increased\r\ncrops, and by a rapid advance in every branch of practical agriculture.\r\nThe disappointment of these extravagant expectations, which _chemists_\r\nthemselves foresaw, and for which they vainly attempted to prepare the\r\nagriculturist, was followed by an equally rapid reaction; and those who\r\nhad embraced Liebig's views, and lauded them as the commencement of a\r\nnew era, but who had absurdly expected an instantaneous effect, changed\r\ntheir opinion, and contemned, as strongly as they had before supported,\r\nthe application of chemistry to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThat this effect should have been produced is not unnatural; for\r\npractical men, having at that time little or no knowledge of chemistry,\r\nwere necessarily unable to estimate its true position in relation to\r\nagriculture, and forgetting that this department of science was still in\r\nits early youth, and burthened with all the faults and errors of youth,\r\nthey treated it as if it were already perfect in all its parts. Neither\r\ncould they distinguish between the fully demonstrated scientific truths,\r\nand the uncertain, though probable conclusions deduced from them; and\r\nwhen the latter, as occasionally happened, proved to be at variance with\r\npractice, it is not surprising: that this should have produced a feeling\r\nof distrust on the part of persons incapable, from an imperfect, and\r\nstill oftener from no knowledge of science, of drawing the line of\r\ndemarcation, which Liebig frequently omitted to do, between the positive\r\nfact and the hypothetical inference, which, however probable, is, after\r\nall, merely a suggestion requiring to be substantiated by experiment.\r\nThis omission, which the scientific reader can supply for himself,\r\nbecomes a source of serious misapprehension in a work addressed to\r\npersons unacquainted with science, who adopt indiscriminately both the\r\nfacts and the hypotheses of the author. And this is no doubt the cause\r\nof the vary different estimation in which the work of the Giessen\r\nProfessor was held by scientific and practical men.\r\n\r\nLiebig's treatise was followed, in the year 1844, by the publication of\r\nBoussingault's _Economic Rurale_, a work winch excited at the time\r\ninfinitely less interest than Liebig's, although it is really quite as\r\nimportant a contribution to scientific agriculture. It is distinguished\r\nby entering more fully into the special details of the application of\r\nchemistry to agriculture, and contains the results of the author's\r\nnumerous searches both in the laboratory and the field. Boussingault\r\npossesses the qualification, at present somewhat rare, of combining a\r\nthorough knowledge of practical agriculture with extended scientific\r\nattainments; and his investigations, which have been made with direct\r\nreference to practice, and their results tested in the field, are the\r\nlargest and most valuable contribution to the exact data of scientific\r\nagriculture which has yet been made public.\r\n\r\nThe year 1844 was also distinguished by the foundation of the\r\nAgricultural Chemistry Association of Scotland, an event of no small\r\nimportance in the history of scientific agriculture. That association\r\nwas instituted through the exertions of a small number of practical\r\nfarmers, for the purpose of pursuing investigations in agricultural\r\nchemistry, and affording to its members assistance in all matters\r\nconnected with the cultivation of the soil, and has formed the model of\r\nsimilar establishments in London, Dublin, and Belfast, as well as in\r\nGermany; and it is peculiarly creditable to the intelligence and energy\r\nof the practical farmers of Scotland, that with them commenced a\r\nmovement, which has already found imitators in so many quarters, and\r\nconferred such great benefits on agriculture. Within the last ten or\r\ntwelve years, and mainly owing to the establishment of agricultural\r\nlaboratories, great progress has been made in accumulating facts on\r\nwhich to found an accurate knowledge of the principles of agricultural\r\nchemistry, and the number of chemists who have devoted themselves to\r\nthis subject has considerably increased, though still greatly less than\r\nits exigencies require.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has recently been done, it must not be\r\nforgotten that we have scarcely advanced beyond the threshold, and that\r\nit is only by numerous and frequently repeated experiments that it is\r\npossible to arrive at satisfactory results. Agricultural inquiries are\r\nliable to peculiar fallacies due to the perturbing influence of climate,\r\nseason, and many other causes, the individual effects of which can only\r\nbe eliminated with difficulty, and much error has been introduced, by\r\nhastily generalising from single experiments, in place of awaiting the\r\nresults of repeated trials. Hence it is that the progress of scientific\r\nagriculture must necessarily be slow and gradual, and is not likely to\r\nbe marked by any great or startling discoveries. Now that the relations\r\nof science to practice are better understood, the extravagant\r\nexpectations at one time entertained have been abandoned, and, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, the interest in agricultural chemistry has again\r\nincreased, and the conviction daily gains ground that no one who wishes\r\nto farm with success, can afford to be without some knowledge of the\r\nscientific principles of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the water naturally existing in plants is expelled by exposure to\r\nthe air or a gentle heat, the residual dry matter is found to be\r\ncomposed of a considerable number of different substances, which have\r\nbeen divided into two great classes, called the organic and the\r\ninorganic, or mineral constituents of plants. The former are readily\r\ncombustible, and on the application of heat, catch fire, and are\r\nentirely consumed, leaving the inorganic matters in the form of a white\r\nresiduum or ash. All plants contain both classes of substances; and\r\nthough their relative proportions vary within very wide limits, the\r\nformer always greatly exceed the latter, which in many cases form only a\r\nvery minute proportion of the whole weight of the plant. Owing to the\r\ngreat preponderance of the organic or combustible matters, it was at one\r\ntime believed that the inorganic substances formed no part of the true\r\nstructure of plants, and consisted only of a small portion of the\r\nmineral matters of the soil, which had been absorbed along with their\r\norganic food; but this opinion, which probably was never universally\r\nentertained, is now entirely abandoned, and it is no longer doubted that\r\nboth classes of substances are equally essential to their existence.\r\n\r\nAlthough they form so large a proportion of the plant, its organic\r\nconstituents are composed of no more than four elements, viz.:--\r\n\r\n     Carbon.\r\n     Hydrogen.\r\n     Nitrogen.\r\n     Oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic constituents are much more numerous, not less than\r\nthirteen substances, which appear to be essential, having been observed.\r\nThese are--\r\n\r\n     Potash.\r\n     Soda.\r\n     Lime.\r\n     Magnesia.\r\n     Peroxide of Iron.\r\n     Silicic Acid.\r\n     Phosphoric Acid.\r\n     Sulphuric Acid.\r\n     Chlorine.\r\n\r\nAnd more rarely\r\n\r\n     Manganese.\r\n     Iodine.\r\n     Bromine.\r\n     Fluorine.\r\n\r\nSeveral other substances, among which may be mentioned alumina and\r\ncopper, have also been enumerated; but there is every reason to believe\r\nthat they are not essential, and the cases in which they have been found\r\nare quite exceptional.\r\n\r\nIt is to be especially noticed that none of these substances occur in\r\nplants in the free or uncombined state, but always in the form of\r\ncompounds of greater or less complexity, and extremely varied both in\r\ntheir properties and composition.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place, in a work like the present, to enter into\r\ncomplete details of the properties of the elements of which plants are\r\ncomposed, which belongs strictly to pure chemistry, but it is necessary\r\nto premise a few observations regarding the organic elements, and their\r\nmore important compounds.\r\n\r\n_Carbon._--When a piece of wood is heated in a close vessel, it is\r\ncharred, and converted into charcoal. This charcoal is the most familiar\r\nform of carbon, but it is not absolutely pure, as it necessarily\r\ncontains the ash of the wood from which it was made. In its purest form\r\nit occurs in the diamond, which is believed to be produced by the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable matters, and it is there crystallized and\r\nremarkably transparent; but when produced by artificial processes,\r\ncarbon is always black, more or less porous, and soils the fingers. It\r\nis insoluble in water, burns readily, and is converted into carbonic\r\nacid. Carbon is the largest constituent of plants, and forms, in round\r\nnumbers, about 50 per cent of their weight when dry.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Acid._--This, the most important compound of carbon and\r\noxygen, is best obtained by pouring a strong acid upon chalk or\r\nlimestone, when it escapes with effervescence. It is a colourless gas,\r\nextinguishing flame, incapable of supporting respiration, much heavier\r\nthan atmospheric air, and slightly soluble in water, which takes up its\r\nown volume of the gas. It is produced abundantly when vegetable matters\r\nare burnt, as also during respiration, fermentation, and many other\r\nprocesses. It is likewise formed daring the decay of animal and\r\nvegetable matters, and is consequently evolved from dung and compost\r\nheaps.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen_ occurs in nature only in combination. Its principal compound\r\nis water, from which it is separated by the simultaneous action of an\r\nacid, such as sulphuric acid and a metal, in the form of a transparent\r\ngas, lighter than any other substance. It is very combustible, burns\r\nwith a pale blue flame, and is converted into water. It is found in all\r\nplants, although in comparatively small quantity, for, when dry, they\r\nrarely contain more than four or five per cent. Its most important\r\ncompound is water, of which it forms one-ninth, the other eight-ninths\r\nconsisting of oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_ exists abundantly in the atmosphere, of which it forms nearly\r\nfour-fifths, or, more exactly, 79 per cent. It is there mixed, but not\r\ncombined with oxygen; and when the latter gas is removed, by introducing\r\ninto a bottle of air some substance for which the former has an\r\naffinity, the nitrogen is left in a state of purity. It is a transparent\r\ngas, which is incombustible and extinguishes flame. It is a singularly\r\ninert substance, and is incapable of directly entering into union with\r\nany other element except oxygen, and with that it combines with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, and only by the action of the electric spark--a\r\npeculiarity which has very important bearings on many points we shall\r\nafterwards have to discuss. Nitrogen is found in plants to the extent of\r\nfrom 1 to 4 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Nitric Acid._--This, the most important compound of nitrogen and\r\noxygen, can be produced by sending a current of electric sparks through\r\na mixture of its constituents, but in this way it can be obtained only\r\nin extremely small quantity. It is much more abundantly produced when\r\norganic matters are decomposed with free access of air, in which case\r\nthe greater proportion of their nitrogen combines with the atmospheric\r\noxygen. This process, which is known by the name of nitrification, is\r\ngreatly promoted by the presence of lime or some other substance, with\r\nwhich the nitric acid may combine in proportion as it is formed. It\r\ntakes place, to a great extent, in the soil in India and other hot\r\nclimates; and our chief supplies of saltpetre, or nitrate of potash, are\r\nderived from the soil in these countries, where it has been formed in\r\nthis manner. The same change occurs, though to a much smaller extent, in\r\nthe soil in temperate climates.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia_ is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, but it cannot be\r\nformed by the direct union of these gases. It is a product of the\r\ndecomposition of organic substances containing nitrogen, and is produced\r\nwhen they are distilled at a high temperature, or allowed to putrefy out\r\nof contact of the air. In its pure state it is a transparent and\r\ncolourless gas, having a peculiar pungent smell, and highly soluble in\r\nwater. It is an alkali resembling potash and soda, and, like these\r\nsubstances, unites with the acids and forms salts, of which the sulphate\r\nand muriate are the most familiar. In these salts it is fixed, and does\r\nnot escape from them unless they be mixed with lime, or some other\r\nsubstance possessing a more powerful affinity for the acid with which it\r\nis united.\r\n\r\n_Oxygen_ is one of the most widely distributed of all the elements, and,\r\nowing to its powerful affinities, is the most important agent in almost\r\nall natural changes. It is found in the air, of which it forms 21 per\r\ncent, and in combination with hydrogen, and almost all the other\r\nchemical elements. In the pure state it possesses very remarkable\r\nproperties. All substances burn in it with greater brilliancy than they\r\ndo in atmospheric air, and its affinity for most of the elements is\r\nextremely powerful. When diluted with nitrogen, it supports the\r\nrespiration of animals; but in the pure state it proves fatal after the\r\nlapse of an hour or two. It is found in plants, in quantities varying\r\nfrom 30 to 36 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, that of the four organic elements, carbon\r\nonly is fixed, and the other three are gases; and likewise, when any two\r\nof them unite, their compound is either a gaseous or a volatile\r\nsubstance. The charring of organic substances, which is one of their\r\nmost characteristic properties, and constantly made use of by chemists\r\nas a distinctive reaction, is due to this peculiarity; for when they are\r\nheated, a simpler arrangement of their particles takes place, the\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen unite among themselves, and carry off a\r\nsmall quantity of carbon, while the remainder is left behind in the form\r\nof charcoal, and is only consumed when access of the external air is\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nNow, in order that a plant may grow, its four organic constituents must\r\nbe absorbed by it, and that this absorption may take place, it is\r\nessential that they be presented to it in suitable forms. A seed may be\r\nplanted in pure carbon, and supplied with unlimited quantities of\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and inorganic substances, and it will not\r\ngerminate; and a plant, when placed in similar circumstances, shows no\r\ndisposition to increase, but rapidly languishes and dies. The obvious\r\ninference from these facts is, that these substances cannot be absorbed\r\nwhen in the _elementary_ state, but that it is only after they have\r\nentered into certain forms of combination that they acquire the property\r\nof being readily taken up, and assimilated by the organs of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time believed that many different compounds of these\r\nelements might be absorbed and elaborated, but later and more accurate\r\nexperiments have reduced the number to four--namely, carbonic acid,\r\nwater, ammonia, and nitric acid. The first supplies carbon, the second\r\nhydrogen, the two last nitrogen, while all of them, with the exception\r\nof ammonia, may supply the plant with oxygen as well as with that\r\nelement of which it is the particular source.\r\n\r\nThere are only two sources from which these substances can be obtained\r\nby the plant, viz. the atmosphere and the soil, and it is necessary that\r\nwe should here consider the mode in which they may be obtained from\r\neach.\r\n\r\n_The Atmosphere as a source of the Organic Constituents of\r\nPlants._--Atmospheric air consists of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen\r\ngases, watery vapour, carbonic acid, ammonia, and nitric acid. The two\r\nfirst are the largest constituents, and the others, though equally\r\nessential, are present in small, and some of them in extremely minute\r\nquantity. When deprived of moisture and its minor constituents, 100\r\nvolumes of air are found to contain 21 of oxygen and 79 of nitrogen.\r\nAlthough these gases are not chemically combined in the air, but only\r\nmechanically mixed, their proportion is exceedingly uniform, for\r\nanalyses completely corresponding with these numbers have been made by\r\nHumboldt, Gay-Lussac, and Dumas at Paris, by Saussure at Geneva, and by\r\nLewy at Copenhagen; and similar results have also been obtained from air\r\ncollected by Gay-Lussac during his ascent in a balloon at the height of\r\n21,430 feet, and by Humboldt on the mountain of Antisano in South\r\nAmerica at a height of 16,640 feet. In short, under all circumstances,\r\nand in all places, the relation subsisting between the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen is constant; and though, no doubt, many local circumstances\r\nexist which may tend to modify their proportions, these are so slow and\r\npartial in their operations, and so counterbalanced by others acting in\r\nan opposite direction, as to retain a uniform proportion between the\r\nmain constituents of the atmosphere, and to prevent the undue\r\naccumulation of one or other of them at any one point.\r\n\r\nNo such uniformity exists in the proportion of the minor constituents.\r\nThe variation in the quantity of watery vapour is a familiar fact, the\r\ndifference between a dry and moist atmosphere being known to the most\r\ncareless observer, and the proportions of the other constituents are\r\nalso liable to considerable variations.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Acid._--The proportion of carbonic acid in the air has been\r\ninvestigated by Saussure. From his experiments, made at the village of\r\nChambeisy, near Geneva, it appears that the quantity is not constant,\r\nbut varies from 3.15 to 5.75 volumes in 10,000; the mean being 4.15.\r\nThese variations are dependent on different circumstances. It was found\r\nthat the carbonic acid was always more abundant during the night than\r\nduring the day--the mean quantity in the former case being 4.32, in the\r\nlatter 3.38. The largest quantity found during the night was 5.74,\r\nduring the day 5.4. Heavy and continued rain diminishes the quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid, by dissolving and carrying it down into the soil.\r\nSaussure found that in the month of July 1827, during the time when nine\r\nmillimetres of rain fell, the average quantity of carbonic acid amounted\r\nto 5.18 volumes in 10,000; while in September 1829, when 254 millimetres\r\nfell, it was only 3.57. A moist state of the soil, which is favourable\r\nto the absorption of carbonic acid, also diminishes the quantity\r\ncontained in the air, while, on the other hand, continued frosts, by\r\nretaining the atmosphere and soil in a dry state, have an opposite\r\neffect. High winds increase the carbonic acid to a small extent. It was\r\nalso found to be greater over the cultivated lands than over the lake of\r\nGeneva; at the tops of mountains than at the level of the sea; in towns\r\nthan in the country. The differences observed in all these cases, though\r\nsmall, are quite distinct, and have been confirmed by subsequent\r\nexperimenters.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia._--The presence of ammonia in the atmosphere appears to have\r\nbeen first observed by Saussure, who found that when the sulphate of\r\nalumina is exposed to the air, it is gradually converted into the double\r\nsulphate of alumina and ammonia. Liebig more recently showed that\r\nammonia can always be detected in rain and snow water, and it could not\r\nbe doubted that it had been absorbed from the atmosphere. Experiments\r\nhave since been made by different observers with the view of determining\r\nthe quantity of atmospheric ammonia, and their results are contained in\r\nthe subjoined table, which gives the quantity found in a million parts\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nKemp                                         3.6800\r\n\r\n        { 12 feet above the surface          3.5000\r\nPierre  { 25 feet  do.  do.                  0.5000\r\n\r\nGraeger                                      0.3230\r\n\r\n          { By day                           0.0980\r\nFresenius { By night                         0.1690\r\n\r\n      {          { Maximum                   0.0317\r\n      { In Paris { Minimum                   0.0177\r\n      {          { Mean                      0.0237\r\nVille {\r\n      {          { Maximum                   0.0276\r\n      { Environs { Minimum                   0.0165\r\n      { of Paris { Mean                      0.0210\r\n\r\nOf these results, the earlier ones of Kemp, Pierre, and Graeger are\r\nundoubtedly erroneous, as they were made without those precautions which\r\nsubsequent experience has shown to be necessary. Even those of the other\r\nobservers must be taken as giving only a very general idea of the\r\nquantity of ammonia in the air, for a proportion so minute as one\r\nfifty-millionth cannot be accurately determined even by the most\r\ndelicate experiments. For this reason, more recent experimenters have\r\nendeavoured to arrive at conclusions bearing more immediately upon\r\nagricultural questions, by determining the quantity of ammonia brought\r\ndown by the rain. The first observations on this subject were made by\r\nBarral in 1851, and they have been repeated during the years 1855 and\r\n1856 by Mr. Way. In 1853, Boussingault also made numerous experiments\r\non the quantity of ammonia in the rain falling at different places, as\r\nwell as in dew and the moisture of fogs. He found in the imperial\r\ngallon--\r\n\r\n                                                            Grs.\r\nRain         { Paris                                        0.2100\r\n             { Liebfrauenberg                               0.0350\r\n\r\n\r\nDew,          Liebfrauenberg           { Maximum            0.4340\r\n                                       { Minimum            0.0714\r\n\r\n            { Liebfrauenberg                                0.1790\r\nFog         { Paris                                         9.6000\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that in Paris the quantity of ammonia in rain-water is\r\njust six times as great as it is in the country, a result, no doubt, due\r\nto the ammonia evolved during the combustion of fuel, and to animal\r\nexhalations, and to the same cause, the large quantity contained in the\r\nmoisture of fogs in Paris may also be attributed. Barral and Way have\r\nmade determinations of the quantity of ammonia carried down by the rain\r\nin each month of the year, the former using for this purpose the water\r\ncollected in the rain-gauges of the Paris Observatory, and representing,\r\ntherefore, a town atmosphere; the latter, that from a large rain-gauge\r\nat Rothamsted, at a distance from any town. According to Barral the\r\nammonia annually deposited on an acre of land amounts to 12.28 lbs., a\r\nquantity considerably exceeding that obtained by Way, whose experiments\r\nbeing made at a distance from towns, must be considered as representing\r\nmore accurately the normal condition of the air. His results for the\r\nyears 1855 and 1856 are given below, along with the quantities of nitric\r\nacid found at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Nitric Acid._--The presence of nitric acid in the air appears to have\r\nbeen first observed by Priestley at the end of the last century, but\r\nLiebig, in 1825, showed that it was always to be found after\r\nthunder-storms, although he failed to detect it at other times. In 1851\r\nBarral proved that it is invariably present in rain-water, and stated\r\nthe quantity annually carried down to an acre of land at no less than\r\n41.29 lbs. But at the time his experiments were made, the methods of\r\ndetermining very minute quantities of nitric acid were exceedingly\r\ndefective, and Way, by the adoption of an improved process, has shown\r\nthat the quantity is very much smaller than Barral supposed, and really\r\nfalls short of three pounds. His results for ammonia, as well as nitric\r\nacid, are given in the subjoined table.\r\n\r\n---------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n|                    | Nitric Acid in | Ammonia in     | Total Nitrogen  |\r\n|                    | Grains.        | Grains.        | in Grains.      |\r\n|                    +-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n|                    | 1855. | 1856.  | 1855. |  1856. |  1855. |  1856. |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n|January             |  230  | 1564   | 1244  |  5,005 |  1084  |  4,526 |\r\n|February            |  944  |  544   | 2337  |  4,175 |  2169  |  3,579 |\r\n|March               | 1102  |  866   | 4513  |  2,108 |  3995  |  1,945 |\r\n|April               |  325  | 1063   | 1141  |  8,614 |  1024  |  7,369 |\r\n|May                 | 1840  | 3024   | 4206  | 18,313 |  3939  | 15,863 |\r\n|June                | 3303  | 2046   | 5574  |  4,870 |  5447  |  4,540 |\r\n|July                | 2680  | 1191   | 9620  |  2,869 |  8615  |  2,670 |\r\n|August              | 3577  | 2125   | 4769  |  4,214 |  4870  |  4,021 |\r\n|September           |  732  | 1756   | 3313  |  5,972 |  2917  |  5,373 |\r\n|October             | 4480  | 2075   | 7592  |  3,921 |  7414  |  3,767 |\r\n|November            | 1007  | 1371   | 3021  |  2,591 |  2749  |  2,489 |\r\n|December            |  664  | 2035   | 2438  |  4,070 |  2180  |  3,352 |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n|Total in pounds for}|       |        |       |        |        |        |\r\n|the whole year     }|  2.98 |   .280 |  7.11 |   9.53 |   6.63 |   8.31 |\r\n+--------------------+-------+--------+----------------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nNo attempts have been made to determine the proportion of nitric acid in\r\nair, but its quantity is undoubtedly excessively minute, and materially\r\nsmaller than that of ammonia. At least this conclusion seems to be a\r\nfair inference from Way's researches, as well as the recent experiments\r\nof Boussingault on the proportion of nitric acid contained in rain, dew,\r\nand fog, made in a manner exactly similar to those on the ammonia,\r\nalready quoted. According to his experiments an imperial gallon\r\ncontains--\r\n\r\n                         Grs.\r\nRain. {Paris             0.0708\r\n      {Liebfrauenberg    0.0140\r\n\r\nDew.  {Maximum           0.0785\r\n      {Minimum           0.0030\r\n\r\nFog.  {Paris             0.7092\r\n      {Liebfrauenberg    0.0718\r\n\r\nAlthough it thus appears that Barral's results have been only partially\r\nconfirmed, enough has been ascertained to show that the quantity of\r\nammonia and nitric acid in the air is sufficient to produce a material\r\ninfluence in the growth of plants. The large amount of these substances\r\ncontained in the dew is also particularly worthy of notice, and may\r\nserve to some extent to explain its remarkably invigorating effect on\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n_Carburetted Hydrogen._--Gay-Lussac, Humboldt, and Boussingault have\r\nshown, that when the whole of the moisture and carbonic acid have been\r\nremoved from the air, it still contains a small quantity of carbon and\r\nhydrogen; and Saussure has rendered it probable that they exist in a\r\nstate of combination as carburetted hydrogen gas. No definite proof of\r\nthis position has, however, as yet been adduced, and the function of the\r\ncompound is entirely unknown. It is possible that the presence of carbon\r\nand hydrogen may be due to a small quantity of organic matter; but,\r\nwhatever be its source, its amount is certainly extremely small.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Phosphuretted Hydrogen._--The proportion of\r\nthese substances is almost infinitesimal; but they are pretty general\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere, and are apparently derived from the\r\ndecomposition of animal and vegetable matters.\r\n\r\nThe preceding statements lead to the important conclusion, that the\r\natmosphere is capable of affording an abundant supply of all the organic\r\nelements of plants, because it not only contains nitrogen and oxygen in\r\nthe free state, but also in those forms of combination in which they are\r\nmost readily absorbed, as well as a large quantity of carbonic acid,\r\nfrom which their carbon may be derived. At first sight it may indeed\r\nappear that the quantity of the latter compound, and still more that of\r\nammonia, is so trifling as to be of little practical importance. But a\r\nvery simple calculation serves to show that, though relatively small,\r\nthey are absolutely large, for the carbonic acid contained in the whole\r\natmosphere amounts in round numbers to\r\n\r\n     2,400,000,000,000 tons,\r\n\r\nand the ammonia, assuming it not to exceed one part in fifty millions,\r\nmust weigh\r\n\r\n     74,000,000 tons,\r\n\r\nquantities amply sufficient to afford an abundant supply of these\r\nelements to the whole vegetation of our globe.\r\n\r\n_The Soil as a Source of the Organic Constituents of Plants._--When a\r\nportion of soil is subjected to heat, it is found that it, like the\r\nplant, consists of a combustible and an incombustible part; but while in\r\nthe plant the incombustible part or ash is small, and the combustible\r\nlarge, these proportions are reversed in the soil, which consists\r\nchiefly of inorganic or mineral matters, mixed with a quantity of\r\ncombustible or organic substances, rarely exceeding 8 or 10 per cent,\r\nand often falling considerably short of this quantity.\r\n\r\nThe organic matter exists in the form of a substance called humus, which\r\nmust be considered here as a source of the organic constituents of\r\nplants, independently of the general composition of the soil, which will\r\nbe afterwards discussed.\r\n\r\nThe term _humus_ is generic, and applied by chemists to a rather\r\nnumerous group of substances, very closely allied in their properties,\r\nseveral of which are generally present in all fertile soils. They have\r\nbeen submitted to examination by various chemists, but by none more\r\naccurately than by Mulder and Herman, to whom, indeed, we owe almost all\r\nthe precise information we possess on the subject. The organic matters\r\nof the soil may be divided into three great classes; the first\r\ncontaining those substances which are soluble in water; the second,\r\nthose extracted by means of caustic potash; and the third, those\r\ninsoluble in all menstrua. When a soil is boiled with a solution of\r\ncaustic potash, a deep brown fluid is obtained, from which acids\r\nprecipitate a dark brown flocculent substance, consisting of a mixture\r\nof at least three different acids, to which the names of humic, ulmic,\r\nand geic acids have been applied. The fluid from which they have been\r\nprecipitated contains two substances, crenic and apocrenic acids, while\r\nthe soil still retains what has been called insoluble humus.\r\n\r\nThe acids above named do not differ greatly in chemical characters, but\r\nthey have been subdivided into the humic, geic, and crenic groups, which\r\npresent some differences in properties and composition. They are\r\ncompounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are characterised by so\r\npowerful an affinity for ammonia that they are with difficulty obtained\r\nfree from that substance, and generally exist in the soil in combination\r\nwith it. They are all products of the decomposition of vegetable\r\nmatters in the soil, and are formed during their decay by a succession\r\nof changes, which may be easily traced by observing the course of events\r\nwhen a piece of wood or any other vegetable substance is exposed for a\r\nlength of time to air and moisture. It is then found gradually to\r\ndisintegrate with the evolution of carbonic acid, acquiring first a\r\nbrown and finally a black colour. At one particular stage of the process\r\nit is converted into one or other of two substances, called humin and\r\nulmin, both insoluble in alkalies, and apparently identical with the\r\ninsoluble humus of the soil; but when the decomposition is more advanced\r\nthe products become soluble in alkalies, and then contain humic, ulmic,\r\nand geic acids, and finally, by a still further progress, crenic and\r\napocrenic acids are formed as the result of an oxidation occurring at\r\ncertain periods of the decay.\r\n\r\nThe roots and other vegetable debris remaining in the soil undergo a\r\nsimilar series of changes, and form the humus, which is found only in\r\nthe surface soil, that is to say, in the portion which is now or has at\r\nsome previous period been occupied by plants, and the quantity of humus\r\ncontained in any soil is mainly dependent on the activity of vegetation\r\non it. Numerous analyses of humus compounds extracted from the soil have\r\nbeen made, and have served to establish a number of minor differences in\r\nthe composition even of those to which the same name has been applied,\r\ndue manifestly to the fact that their production is the result of a\r\ngradual decomposition, which renders it impossible to extract from the\r\nsoil one pure substance, but only a variable mixture of several, so\r\nsimilar to one another in properties, that their separation is very\r\ndifficult, if not impossible. For this reason great discrepancies exist\r\nin the statements made regarding them by different observers, but this\r\nis a matter of comparatively small importance, as their exact\r\ncomposition has no very direct bearing on agricultural questions, and it\r\nwill suffice to give the names and chemical formulae of those which have\r\nbeen analysed and described,--\r\n\r\nUlmic acid from long Frisian turf    C_{40}  H_{18}  O_{16}\r\nHumic acid from hard turf            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{15}\r\nHumic acid from arable soil          C_{40}  H_{16}  O_{16}\r\nHumic acid from a pasture field      C_{40}  H_{14}  O_{14}\r\nGeic acid                            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{17}\r\nApocrenic acid                       C_{48}  H_{12}  O_{24}\r\nCrenic acid                          C_{24}  H_{12}  O_{16}\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to observe further, that these formulae indicate a\r\nclose connection with woody fibre, and the continuous diminution of the\r\nhydrogen and increase of oxygen shows that they must have been produced\r\nby a gradually advancing decay.\r\n\r\nThe earlier chemists and vegetable physiologists attributed to the humus\r\nof the soil a much more important function than it is now believed to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly considered to be the exclusive, or at least the chief\r\nsource of the organic constituents of plants, and by absorption through\r\nthe roots to yield to them the greater part of their nutriment. But\r\nthough this view has still some supporters, among whom Mulder is the\r\nmost distinguished, it is now generally admitted that humus is not a\r\n_direct_ source of the organic constituents of plants, and is not\r\nabsorbed as such by their roots, although it is so _indirectly_, in as\r\nfar as the decomposition which it is constantly undergoing in the soil\r\nyields carbonic acid, which can be absorbed. The older opinion is\r\nrefuted by many well-ascertained facts. As regards the exclusive origin\r\nof the carbon of plants from humus, it is easy to see that this at least\r\ncannot be true, for humus, as already stated, is itself derived solely\r\nfrom the decomposition of vegetable and animal matters; and if the\r\nplants on the earth's surface were to be supported by it alone, the\r\nwhole of their substance would have to return to the soil in the same\r\nform, in order to supply the generation which succeeds them. But this is\r\nvery far from being the case, for the respiration of animals, the\r\ncombustion of fuel, and many other processes, are annually converting a\r\nlarge quantity of these matters into carbonic acid; and if there were no\r\nother source of carbon but the humus of the soil, the amount of\r\nvegetable life would gradually diminish, and at length become entirely\r\nextinct. Schleiden, who has discussed this subject very fully, has made\r\nan approximative calculation of the total quantity of humus on the\r\nearth's surface, and of the carbon annually converted into carbonic acid\r\nby the respiration of man and animals, the combustion of wood for fuel,\r\nand other minor processes; and he draws the conclusion that, if there\r\nwere no other source of carbon except humus, the quantity of that\r\nsubstance existing in the soil would only support vegetation for a\r\nperiod of sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe particular phenomena of vegetation also afford abundant evidence\r\nthat humus cannot be the only source of carbon. Thus Boussingault has\r\nshown that on the average of years, the crops cultivated on an acre of\r\nland remove from it about one ton more organic matter than they receive\r\nin the manure applied to them, although there is no corresponding\r\ndiminution in the quantity of humus contained in the soil. An instance\r\nwhich leads still more unequivocally to the same conclusion is given by\r\nHumboldt. He states that an acre of land, planted with bananas, yields\r\nannually about 152,000 pounds weight of fruit, containing about 32,000\r\npounds, or almost exactly 14 tons of carbon; and as this production goes\r\non during a period of twenty years, there must be withdrawn in that time\r\nno less than 280 tons of carbon. But the soil on an acre of land weighs,\r\nin round numbers, 1000 tons, and supposing it to contain 4 per cent of\r\nhumus, the total weight of carbon in it would amount to little more than\r\n20 tons.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from these and many other analogous facts that humus\r\ncannot be the only or even a considerable source of the carbon of\r\nplants, although it is still contended by some chemists that it may be\r\nabsorbed to a small extent. But even this is at variance with many\r\nwell-known facts. For if humus were absorbed, it might be expected that\r\nvegetation would be most luxuriant on soils containing abundance of that\r\nsubstance, especially if it existed in a soluble and readily absorbable\r\nform; but so far from this being the case, nothing is more certain than\r\nthat peat, in which these conditions are fulfilled, is positively\r\ninjurious to most plants. On the other hand, our daily experience\r\naffords innumerable examples of plants growing luxuriantly in soils and\r\nplaces where no humus exists. The sands of the sea-shore, and the most\r\nbarren rocks, have their vegetation, and the red-hot ashes which are\r\nthrown out by active volcanoes are no sooner cool than a crop of plants\r\nsprings up on them.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from these considerations have been further\r\nconfirmed by the direct experiments of different observers. Boussingault\r\nsowed peas, weighing 15.60 grains, in a soil composed of a mixture of\r\nsand and clay, which had been heated red-hot, and consequently contained\r\nno humus, and after 99 days' growth, during which they had been watered\r\nwith distilled water, he found the crop to weigh 68.72 grains, so that\r\nthere had been a fourfold increase. Similar experiments have been made\r\nby Prince Salm Horstmar, on oats and rape sown in a soil deprived of\r\norganic matter by ignition, in which they grew readily, and arrived at\r\ncomplete maturity. One oat straw attained a height of three feet, and\r\nbore 78 grains; another bore 47; and a third 28--in all 153. These when\r\ndried at 212 deg. weighed 46.302 grains, and the straw 45.6 grains. The most\r\nsatisfactory experiments, however, are those of Weigman and Polstorf,\r\nthese observers having found that it was possible to obtain a\r\ntwo-hundred-fold produce of barley in an entirely artificial soil,\r\nprovided care was taken to give it the _physical_ characters of a\r\nfertile soil. They prepared a mixture of six parts of sand, two of\r\nchalk, one of white bole, and one of wood charcoal; to which was added a\r\nsmall quantity of felspar, previously fused with marble and some soluble\r\nsalts, so as to imitate as closely as possible the inorganic parts of a\r\nsoil, and in it they planted twelve barley pickles. The plants grew\r\nluxuriantly, reaching a height of three feet, and each bearing nine\r\nears, containing 22 pickles. The grain of the twelve plants weighed 2040\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show that plants can grow and produce seed when the\r\nmost scrupulous care is taken to deprive them of every trace of humus.\r\nBut Saussure has gone further, and shown that even when present, humus\r\nis not absorbed. He allowed plants of the common bean and the Polygonum\r\nPersicaria to grow in solutions of humate of potash, and found a very\r\ntrifling diminution in the quantity of humic acid present; but the value\r\nof his experiments is invalidated by his having omitted to ascertain\r\nwhether the diminution of humic acid which he observed was really due\r\nto absorption by the plant. This omission has been supplied by Weigman\r\nand Polstorf. They grew plants of mint (Mentha undulata) and of\r\nPolygonum Persicaria in solutions of humate of potash, and placed beside\r\nthe glass containing the plant, another perfectly similar, and\r\ncontaining only the solution of humate of potash. The solution, which\r\ncontained in every 100 grains, 0.148 grains of solid matter, consisting\r\nof humate of potash, etc. was found to become gradually paler, and at\r\nthe end of a month, during which time the plants had increased by 6-1/2\r\ninches, the quantity of solid matter in 100 grains had diminished to\r\n0.132. But the solution contained in the other glass, and in which no\r\nplant had grown, had diminished to 0.136, so that the absorption could\r\nnot have amounted to more than 0.004 grains for every 100 grains of\r\nsolution employed. This quantity is so small as to be within the limits\r\nof error of experiment, and we are consequently entitled to draw the\r\nconclusion that humus, even under the most favourable circumstances, is\r\nnot absorbed by plants.\r\n\r\nBut though not directly capable of affording nutriment to plants, it\r\nmust not, on that account, be supposed that humus is altogether devoid\r\nof importance, for it is constantly undergoing decomposition in the\r\nsoil, and thus becomes a source of carbonic acid which can be absorbed,\r\nand, as we shall afterwards more particularly see, it exercises very\r\nimportant functions in bringing the other constituents of the soil into\r\nreadily available forms of combination.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed that carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and\r\noxygen, cannot be absorbed by plants when uncombined, but only in the\r\nforms of water, carbonic acid, ammonia, and nitric acid. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to detail the grounds on which this conclusion has been\r\narrived at in regard to carbon and hydrogen, for practically it is of\r\nlittle importance whether they can be absorbed or not, as the former is\r\nrarely, the latter never, found uncombined in nature. Neither can there\r\nbe any doubt that water and carbonic acid are the only substances from\r\nwhich these elements can be obtained. Every-day experience convinces us\r\nthat water is essential to vegetation; and Saussure, and other\r\nobservers, have shown that plants will not grow if they are deprived of\r\ncarbonic acid, and that they actually absorb that substance abundantly\r\nfrom the atmosphere. The evidence for the non-absorption of oxygen lies\r\nchiefly in the fact that plants obtain, in the form of water and\r\ncarbonic acid, a larger quantity of that element than they require, and\r\nin place of absorbing, are constantly exhaling it. The form in which\r\nnitrogen may be absorbed has given rise to much difference of opinion.\r\nIn the year 1779, Priestley commenced the examination of this subject,\r\nand drew from his experiments the conclusion, that plants absorb the\r\nnitrogen of the air. Saussure shortly afterwards examined the same\r\nsubject, and having found, that when grown in a confined space of air,\r\nand watered with pure water, the nitrogen of the plants underwent no\r\nincrease, he inferred that they derived their entire supplies of that\r\nelement from ammonia, or the soluble nitrogenous constituents of the\r\nsoil or manure. Boussingault has since re-examined this question, and by\r\na most elaborate series of experiments, in which the utmost care was\r\ntaken to avoid every source of fallacy, he was led to the conclusion,\r\nthat when haricots, oats, lupins, and cresses were grown in calcined\r\npumice-stone, mixed with the ash of plants, and supplied with air\r\ndeprived of ammonia and nitric acid, their nitrogen underwent no\r\nincrease. It has been objected to these experiments, that the plants\r\nbeing confined in a limited bulk of air, were placed in an unnatural\r\ncondition, and Ville has recently repeated them with a current of air\r\npassing through the apparatus, and found a slight increase in the\r\nnitrogen, due, as he thinks, to direct absorption. It is much more\r\nprobable, however, that it depends on small quantities of ammonia or\r\nnitric acid which had not been completely removed from the air by the\r\nmeans employed for that purpose, for nothing is more difficult than the\r\ncomplete abstraction of these substances, and as the gain of nitrogen\r\nwas only 0.8 grains, while 60,000 gallons of air, and 13 of water, were\r\nemployed in the experiment, which lasted for a considerable time, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that a sufficient quantity may have remained to\r\nproduce this trifling increase.\r\n\r\nWhile these experiments show that plants maintain only a languid\r\nexistence when grown in air deprived of ammonia and nitric acid, and\r\nhence, that the direct absorption of nitrogen, if it occur at all, must\r\ndo so to a very small extent, the addition of a very minute quantity of\r\nthe former substance immediately produces an active vegetation and rapid\r\nincrease in size of the plants. Among the most striking proofs of this\r\nare the experiments of Wolff, made by growing barley and vetches in a\r\nsoil calcined so as to destroy organic matters, and then mixed with\r\nsmall quantities of different compounds of ammonia. He found that when\r\nthe produce from the calcined soil was represented by 100, that from the\r\ndifferent ammoniacal salts was--\r\n\r\n                        Barley.     Vetches.\r\n\r\nMuriate of Ammonia       257.2      176.4\r\nCarbonate of Ammonia     123.6      173.8\r\nSulphate of Ammonia      203.6      125.2\r\n\r\nThese experiments not only prove that ammonia can be absorbed, but they\r\nalso indirectly confirm the statement already made, that humus is not\r\nnecessary; for in some instances the produce was higher than that\r\nobtained from the uncalcined soil with the same manures, although it\r\ncontained four per cent of humus.\r\n\r\nOn such experiments Liebig rests his opinion that ammonia is the\r\nexclusive source of the nitrogen of plants, and although he has recently\r\nadmitted that it may be replaced by nitric acid, it is obvious that he\r\nconsiders this a rare and exceptional occurrence. The evidence, however,\r\nfor the absorption of nitric acid appears to rest on as good grounds as\r\nthat of ammonia, for experience has shown that nitrate of soda acts\r\npowerfully as a manure, and its effect must be due to the nitric acid,\r\nand not to the soda, for the other compounds of that alkali have no such\r\neffect. Wolff has illustrated this point by a series of experiments on\r\nthe sunflower, of which we shall quote one. He took two seeds of that\r\nplant, and sowed them on the 10th May, in a soil composed of calcined\r\nsand, mixed with a small quantity of the ash of plants, and added at\r\nintervals during the progress of the experiment, a quantity of nitrate\r\nof potash, amounting in all to 17.13 grains. The plants were watered\r\nwith distilled water, containing carbonic acid in solution, and the pot\r\nin which they grew was protected from rain and dew by a glass cover. On\r\nthe 19th August one of the plants had attained a height of above 28\r\ninches, and had nine fine leaves and a flower-bud; the other was about\r\n20 inches high, and had ten leaves. On the 22d August, one of the plants\r\nhaving been accidentally injured, the experiment was terminated. The\r\nplants, which contained 103.16 grains of dry matter, were then carefully\r\nanalysed, and the quantity of nitrogen contained in the soil after the\r\nexperiment and in the seed was determined.\r\n\r\n                                   Grains.\r\nNitrogen in the dry plants         1.737   }\r\n    \"    remaining in the soil     0.697   }  2.434\r\n\r\n    \"    in the nitrate of potash  2.370   }\r\n    \"    in the seeds              0.029   }  2.399\r\n                                             ------\r\n                            Difference        0.035\r\n\r\nHence, the nitrogen contained in the plants must, in this instance, have\r\nbeen obtained entirely from the nitrate of potash, for the quantity\r\ncontained in it and in the seeds is exactly equal to that in the plants\r\nand the soil, the difference of 0.03 grains being so small that it may\r\nbe safely attributed to the errors inseparable from such experiments.\r\nFor the sake of comparison, an exactly similar experiment was made on\r\ntwo seeds grown without nitrate of potash, and in this instance, after\r\nan equally long period of growth, the largest plant had only attained a\r\nheight of 7.5 inches, and had three small pale and imperfectly developed\r\nleaves. They contained only 0.033 grains of nitrogen, while the seeds\r\ncontained 0.032--indicating that, under these circumstances, there was\r\nno increase in the quantity of that element.\r\n\r\nBut, independently of these experimental results, it may be inferred\r\nfrom general considerations, that nitric acid must be one of the sources\r\nfrom which plants derive their nitrogen. It has been already stated,\r\nthat the humus contained in the soil consists of the remains of decayed\r\nplants, and there is every reason to suppose that the primeval soil\r\ncontained no organic matters, and that the first generation of plants\r\nmust have derived the whole of their nitrogen from, the atmosphere. If,\r\ntherefore, it be assumed that ammonia is the only source of the\r\nnitrogen of plants, it would follow, that as that substance cannot be\r\nproduced by the direct union of its elements, the quantity of ammonia in\r\nthe air could only remain undiminished in the event of the whole of the\r\nnitrogen of decaying plants returning into that form. But this is\r\ncertainly not the case, for every time a vegetable substance is burned,\r\npart of its nitrogen is liberated in the free state, and in certain\r\nconditions of putrefaction, nitric acid is produced. Now, if ammonia be\r\nthe only form in which nitrogen is absorbed, there must be a gradual\r\ndiminution of the quantity contained in the air; and further, there must\r\neither be some continuous source of supply by which its quantity is\r\nmaintained, or there must be some other substance capable of affording\r\nnitrogen in a form fitted for the maintenance of plant life. As regards\r\nthe first alternative, it must be stated that we know of no source other\r\nthan the decomposition of plants from which ammonia can be derived, and\r\nwe are therefore compelled to adopt the second alternative, and to admit\r\nthat there must be some other source of nitrogen, and it cannot be\r\ndoubted, from what has been already stated, that it is from nitric acid\r\nonly that it can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, then, that carbonic acid, ammonia, nitric acid, and\r\nwater, are the great organic foods of plants. But while they have\r\nafforded to them an inexhaustible supply of the last, the quantity of\r\nthe other three available for food are limited, and insufficient to\r\nsustain their life for a prolonged period. It has been shown by\r\nChevandrier, that an acre of land under beech wood accumulates annually\r\nabout 1650 lb. of carbon. Now, the column of air resting upon an acre of\r\nland contains only about 15,500 lb. of carbon, and the soil may be\r\nestimated to contain 1 per cent., or 22,400 lb. per acre, and the whole\r\nof this carbon would therefore be removed, both from the air and the\r\nsoil, in the course of little more than 23 years. But it is a familiar\r\nfact, that plants continue to grow with undiminished luxuriance year\r\nafter year in the same soil, and they do so because neither their carbon\r\nnor their nitrogen are permanently absorbed; they are there only for a\r\nperiod, and when the plant has finished its functions, and dies, they\r\nsooner or later return into their original state. Either the plant\r\ndecays, in which case its carbon and nitrogen pass more or less rapidly\r\ninto their original state, or it becomes the food of animals, and by the\r\nprocesses of respiration and secretion, the same change is indirectly\r\neffected. In this way a sort of balance is sustained; the carbon, which\r\nat one moment is absorbed by the plant, passes in the next into the\r\ntissues of the animal, only to be again expired in that state in which\r\nit is fitted to commence again its round of changes.\r\n\r\nBut while there is thus a continuous circulation of these constituents\r\nthrough both plants and animals, there are various changes which tend to\r\nliberate in the free state a certain quantity both of the carbon and\r\nnitrogen of plants, and these being thus removed from the sphere of\r\norganic life, there would be a gradual diminution in the amount of\r\nvegetation at the earth's surface, unless this loss were counterbalanced\r\nby some corresponding source of gain. In regard to carbonic acid the\r\nmost important source is volcanic action, but the loss of nitrogen,\r\nwhich is far more important and considerable, is restored by the direct\r\ncombination of its elements. The formation of nitric acid during thunder\r\nstorms has been long familiar; but it would appear from the recent\r\nexperiments of Cloeez, which, should they be confirmed by farther\r\nenquiry, will be of much importance, that this compound is also\r\nproduced without electrical action when air is passed over certain\r\nporous substances, saturated with alkaline and earthy compounds.\r\nFragments of calcined brick and pumice stone were saturated with\r\nsolution of carbonate of potash, with carbonates of lime and magnesia\r\nand other mixtures, and a current of air freed from nitric acid and\r\nammonia passed over them for a long period, at the end of which notable\r\nquantities of nitric acid were detected.\r\n\r\n_Source of the Inorganic Constituents of Plants._--The inorganic\r\nconstituents of plants being all fixed substances, it is sufficiently\r\nobvious that they can only be obtained from the soil, which, as we shall\r\nafterwards see, contains all of them in greater or less abundance, and\r\nhas always been admitted to be the only substance capable of supplying\r\nthem. The older chemists and physiologists, however, attributed no\r\nimportance to these substances, and from the small quantities in which\r\nthey are found in plants, imagined that they were there merely\r\naccidental impurities absorbed from the soil along with the humus, which\r\nwas at that time considered to be their organic food. This opinion,\r\nsufficiently disproved by the constant occurrence of the same substances\r\nin nearly the same proportions, in the ash of each individual plant, has\r\nbeen further refuted by the experiments of Prince Salm Horstmar, who has\r\nestablished their importance to vegetation, by experiments upon oats\r\ngrown on artificial soils, in each of which one inorganic constituent\r\nwas omitted. He found that, without silica, the grain vegetated, but\r\nremained small, pale in colour, and so weak as to be incapable of\r\nsupporting itself; without lime, it died when it had produced its second\r\nleaf; without potash and soda, it grew only to the height of three\r\ninches; without magnesia, it was weak and incapable of supporting\r\nitself; without phosphoric acid, weak but upright; and without sulphuric\r\nacid, though normal in form, the plant was feeble, and produced no\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n_Manner in which the Constituents of Plants are absorbed._--Having\r\ntreated of the sources of the elements of plants, it is necessary to\r\ndirect attention to the mode in which they enter their system.\r\n\r\n_Water._--The absorption of water by plants takes place in great\r\nabundance, and is connected with many of the most important phenomena of\r\nvegetation. It is principally absorbed by the roots, and passes into the\r\ntissues of the plant, where a part of it is decomposed, and goes to the\r\nformation of certain of its organic compounds; while by far the larger\r\nquantity, in place of remaining in it, is again exhaled by the leaves.\r\nThe extent to which this takes place is very large. Hales found that a\r\nsunflower exhaled in twelve hours about 1 lb. 5 oz. of water, but this\r\nquantity was liable to considerable variation, being greater in dry, and\r\nless in wet weather, and much diminished during the night. Saussure made\r\nsimilar experiments, and observed that the quantity of water exhaled by\r\na sunflower amounted to about 220 lb. in four months. The exhalation of\r\nplants has recently been examined with great accuracy by Lawes. His\r\nexperiments were made by planting single plants of wheat, barley, beans,\r\npeas, and clover, in large glass jars capable of holding about 42 lb. of\r\nsoil, and covered with glass plates, furnished with a hole in the centre\r\nfor the passage of the stem of the plant. Water was supplied to the soil\r\nat certain intervals, and the jars were carefully weighed. The result of\r\nthe experiments, continued during a period of 172 days, is given in the\r\nfollowing table, which shows the total quantity of water exhaled in\r\ngrains:--\r\n\r\nWheat                    113,527\r\nBarley                   120,025\r\nBeans                    112,231\r\nPeas                     109,082\r\nClover, cut 28th June     55,093\r\n\r\nIt further appears, that the exhalation is not uniform, but increases\r\nduring the active growth of the plant, and diminishes again when that\r\nperiod is passed. These variations are shown by the subjoined tables, of\r\nwhich the first gives the total exhalation, and the second the average\r\ndaily loss of water during certain periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--_Showing the Number of Grains of Water given off by the Plants\r\nduring stated divisional Periods of their Growth._\r\n\r\n+-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n|Description|9 Days. |31 Days.|27 Days.|34 Days.|30 Days.|14 Days.| 27 Days.|\r\n|           +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n|of Plant.  | From   |From    |From    |From    |From    |From    | From    |\r\n|           | Mar. 19|Mar. 28 |Apr. 28 |May 25  |June 28 |July 28 | Aug. 11 |\r\n|           | to     |to      |to      |to      |to      |to      | to      |\r\n|           |Mar. 28.|Apr. 28.|May 25. |June 28.|July 28.|Aug. 11.| Sept. 7.|\r\n+-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n|Wheat      | 129    | 1268   |  4,385 | 40,030 | 46,060 | 15,420 |   6235  |\r\n|Barley     | 129    | 1867   | 12,029 | 37,480 | 45,060 | 17,046 |   6414  |\r\n|Beans      |  88    | 1854   |  4,846 | 30,110 | 58,950 | 12,626 |   3657  |\r\n|Pease      | 101    | 1332   |  2,873 | 36,715 | 62,780 |  5,281 |    ...  |\r\n|Clover     | 400    | 1645   |  2,948 | 50,100 |   ...  |    ... |    ...  |\r\n+-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.--_Showing the average daily Loss of Water (in Grains) by the\r\nPlants, within several stated divisional Periods of their Growth._\r\n\r\n+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n| Description|9 Days. |31 Days.|27 Days.|34 Days.|30 Days.|14 Days.|27 Days.|\r\n|            +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n| of Plant.  | From   | From   | From   | From   | From   | From   | From   |\r\n|            |Mar. 19 |Mar. 28 |Apr. 28 |May 25  |June 28 |July 28 |Aug. 11 |\r\n|            | to     | to     | to     | to     | to     | to     | to     |\r\n|            |Mar. 28.|Apr. 28.|May 25. |June 28.|July 28.|Aug. 11.|Sept. 7.|\r\n+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n| Wheat      | 14.3   | 40.9   | 162.4  | 1177.4 | 1535.3 | 1101.4 | 230.9  |\r\n| Barley     | 14.3   | 60.2   | 445.5  | 1102.3 | 1502.0 | 1217.6 | 237.5  |\r\n| Beans      |  9.7   | 59.8   | 179.5  |  885.6 | 1965.0 |  901.8 | 135.4  |\r\n| Peas       | 11.2   | 42.9   | 106.4  | 1079.8 | 2092.7 |  377.2 |  ...   |\r\n| Clover     | 44.4   | 53.0   | 109.2  | 1473.5 |   ...  |   ...  |  ...   |\r\n+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments were made with the same plants in soils to which\r\ncertain manures had been added, and with results generally similar.\r\nCalculating from these experiments, we are led to the apparently\r\nanomalous conclusion that the quantity of water exhaled by the plants\r\ngrowing on an acre of land greatly exceeds the annual fall of rain;\r\nalthough it is obvious that of all the rain which falls, only a small\r\nproportion can be absorbed by the plants growing on the soil, for a\r\nlarge quantity is carried off by the rivers, and never reaches their\r\nroots. It has been calculated, for instance, that the Thames carries off\r\nin this way at least one-third of the annual rain that falls in the\r\ndistrict watered by it, and the Rhine nearly four-fifths. Of course this\r\nlarge exhalation must depend on the repeated absorption of the same\r\nquantity of water, which, after being exhaled, is again deposited on the\r\nsoil in the form of dew, and passes repeatedly through the plant. This\r\nconstant percolation of water is of immense importance to the plant, as\r\nit forms the channel through which some of its other constituents are\r\ncarried to it.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Acid._--While the larger part of the water which a plant\r\nrequires is absorbed by its roots, the reverse is the case with carbonic\r\nacid. A certain proportion no doubt is carried up through the roots by\r\nthe water, which always contains a quantity of that gas in solution, but\r\nby far the larger proportion is directly absorbed from the air by the\r\nleaves. A simple experiment of Boussingault's illustrates this\r\nabsorption very strikingly. He took a large glass globe having three\r\napertures, through one of which he introduced the branch of a vine, with\r\ntwenty leaves on it. With one of the side apertures a tube was\r\nconnected, by means of which the air could be drawn slowly through the\r\nglobe, and into an apparatus in which its carbonic acid was accurately\r\ndetermined. He found, in this way, that while the air which entered the\r\nglobe contained 0.0004 of carbonic acid, that which escaped contained\r\nonly 0.0001, so that three-fourths of the carbonic acid had been\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia and Nitric Acid._--Little is known regarding the mode in which\r\nthese substances enter the plant. It is usually supposed that they are\r\nentirely absorbed by the roots, and no doubt the greater proportion is\r\ntaken up in this way, but it is very probable that they may also be\r\nabsorbed by the leaves, at least the addition of ammonia to the air in\r\nwhich plants are grown, materially accelerates vegetation. It is\r\nprobable, however, that the rain carries down the ammonia to the roots,\r\nand there is no doubt that that derived from the decomposition of the\r\nnitrogenous matters in the soil is so absorbed.\r\n\r\n_Inorganic Constituents._--The inorganic constituents of course are\r\nentirely absorbed by the roots; and it is as a solvent for them that the\r\nlarge quantity of water continually passing through the plants is so\r\nimportant. They exist in the soil in particular states of combination,\r\nin which they are scarcely soluble in water. But their solubility is\r\nincreased by the presence of carbonic acid contained in the water, and\r\nwhich causes it to dissolve, to some extent, substances otherwise\r\ninsoluble. It is in this way that lime, which occurs in the soil\r\nprincipally as the insoluble carbonate, is dissolved and absorbed. And\r\nphosphate of lime is also taken up by water containing carbonic acid, or\r\neven common salt in solution. The amount of solubility produced by these\r\nsubstances is extremely small; but it is sufficient for the purpose of\r\nsupplying to the plant as much of its mineral constituents as are\r\nrequired, for the quantity of water which, as we have already seen,\r\npasses through a plant is very large when compared with the amount of\r\ninorganic matters absorbed. It has been shown by Lawes and Gilbert, that\r\nabout 2000 grains of water pass through a plant for every grain of\r\nmineral matter fixed in it, so that there is no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding how the absorption takes place.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, however, that the absorption of the elements of\r\nplants takes place even though they may not be in solution in the soil,\r\nthe roots apparently possessing the power of directly acting on and\r\ndissolving insoluble matters; but a distinction must be drawn between\r\nthis and the view entertained by Jethro Tull, who supposed that they\r\nmight be absorbed in the solid state, provided they were reduced to a\r\nstate of sufficient comminution. It is now no longer doubted that,\r\nwhatever action the roots may exert, the constituents of the plant must\r\nbe in solution before they can pass into it--experiment having\r\ndistinctly shown that the spongioles or apertures through which this\r\nabsorption takes place are too minute to admit even the smallest solid\r\nparticle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substances absorbed by the plant, which are of simple composition,\r\nand contain only two elements, are elaborated within it, and converted\r\ninto the many complicated compounds of which its mass is composed. Some\r\nof these, as, for example, the colouring matters of madder and indigo,\r\nthe narcotic principle of the poppy, &c., are confined to a single\r\nspecies, or small group of plants, while others are found in all plants,\r\nand form the main bulk of their tissues. The latter are the only\r\nsubstances which claim notice in a treatise like the present. They have\r\nbeen divided into three great classes, of widely different properties,\r\ncomposition, and functions.\r\n\r\n_1st. The Saccharine and Amylaceous Constituents._--These substances are\r\ncompounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and all possess a certain\r\ndegree of similarity in composition, the quantities of hydrogen and\r\noxygen they contain being always in the proportion required to form\r\nwater, so that they may be considered as compounds of carbon and water;\r\nnot that it can be asserted that they actually do contain water, as\r\nsuch, for of that there is no evidence, but only that its elements are\r\npresent in the proportion to form it.\r\n\r\n_Cellulose._--This substance forms the fundamental part of all plants.\r\nIt is the principal constituent of woody fibre, and is found in a state\r\nof purity in the fibre of cotton and flax, and in the pith of plants;\r\nbut in wood it is generally contaminated with another substance, which\r\nhas received the name incrusting matter, because it is deposited in and\r\naround the cells of which the plant is in part composed. Cellulose is\r\ninsoluble in all menstrua, but, when boiled for a long time with\r\nsulphuric acid, is converted into a substance called dextrine. Cellulose\r\nconsists of--\r\n\r\n           From pith of Elder-tree.  Spongioles of roots.\r\n\r\nCarbon              43.37                43.00\r\nHydrogen             6.04                 6.18\r\nOxygen              50.59                50.82\r\n                  -------              -------\r\n                   100.00               100.00\r\n\r\nIt is represented chemically by the formula, C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}, which\r\nshows it to be a compound of 24 atoms of carbon with 21 of hydrogen and\r\n21 of oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Incrusting matter._--Large quantities of this substance enter into the\r\ncomposition of all plants. Of its chemical nature little is known, as it\r\ncannot be obtained separate from cellulose, but it is analogous to that\r\nsubstance in its composition, and probably contains hydrogen and oxygen\r\nin the proportion to form water.\r\n\r\n_Starch._--Starch is one of the most abundant constituents of plants,\r\nand is found in most seeds, as those of the cereals and the leguminous\r\nplants; in the tubers of the potatoe, the bulbs of tulips, &c. &c. It is\r\nobtained by placing a quantity of wheat flour in a bag, and kneading it\r\nunder a gentle stream of water. When the water is allowed to stand, it\r\ndeposits the starch as a fine white powder, which, when examined by the\r\nmicroscope, is found to be composed of minute grains, formed of\r\nconcentric layers deposited on one another. These grains vary\r\nconsiderably in size and structure in different plants; but in the same\r\nplant they are generally so much alike as to admit of their recognition\r\nby a practised observer. They were formerly believed to be composed of\r\nan external coating of a substance insoluble in water, and containing in\r\ntheir interior a soluble kernel; but this opinion has been refuted, and\r\ndistinct evidence been brought to show that the exterior and interior of\r\nthe globules are identical in chemical properties. Starch is insoluble\r\nin cold water, but by boiling, it dissolves, forming a thick paste. By\r\nlong continued boiling with water containing a small quantity of acid,\r\nit is completely dissolved and converted into dextrine, and eventually\r\ninto sugar. The same change is produced by the action of fermenting\r\nsubstances, such as the extract of malt; when heated in the dry state to\r\na temperature of about 390 Fahr., it becomes soluble in cold water. It\r\nis distinguished by giving a brilliant blue compound with iodine. Starch\r\ncontains--\r\n\r\n     Carbon    44.47\r\n     Hydrogen   6.28\r\n     Oxygen    49.25\r\n              ------\r\n              100.00\r\n\r\nand its composition is represented by the formula C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}, so\r\nthat it differs but little from cellulose in composition, although its\r\nchemical functions in the plant are extremely different. It is connected\r\nwith some of the most important changes which occur in the growing\r\nplants, and by a series of remarkable transformations is converted into\r\nsugar and other important compounds.\r\n\r\n_Lichen Starch_ is found in most species of lichens, and is\r\ndistinguished from common starch by producing a green colour with\r\niodine. Its composition is the same as that of ordinary starch.\r\n\r\n_Inuline._--The species of starch to which this name is given is\r\ncharacterised by its dissolving in boiling water, and giving a white\r\npulverulent deposit in cooling. It is found in the tuber of the dahlia,\r\nin the dandelion, and some other plants. Its composition is identical\r\nwith that of cellulose, and its formula is C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}.\r\n\r\n_Gum_ is excreted from various plants as a thick fluid, which dries up\r\ninto transparent masses. Its composition is identical with that of\r\nstarch. It dissolves readily in cold water, and is converted into sugar\r\nby long continued boiling with acids. Its properties are best marked in\r\ngum arabic, which is obtained from various species of acacia; that from\r\nother plants differs to some extent, although its chemical composition\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\n_Dextrine._--When starch is exposed to a heat of about 400 deg., or when\r\ntreated with sulphuric acid, or with a substance extracted from malt\r\ncalled _diastase_, it is converted into dextrine. It may also be\r\nobtained from cellulose by a similar treatment. The dextrine so obtained\r\nhas the same composition as the starch from which it is produced, but\r\nits properties more nearly resemble those of gum. It plays a very\r\nimportant part in the process of germination, and may be converted into\r\nsugar on the one hand, and apparently also into starch on the other.\r\n\r\n_Sugar._--Under this name are included four or five distinct substances,\r\nof which the most important are, cane sugar, grape sugar, and the\r\nuncrystallisable sugar found in many plants.\r\n\r\n_Cane Sugar._--This variety of sugar, as its name implies, is found most\r\nabundantly in the sugar cane, but it occurs also in the maple,\r\nbeet-root, and various species of palms, from all of which it is\r\nextracted on the large scale. It is extremely soluble in water, and can\r\nbe obtained in large transparent prismatic crystals, as in common\r\nsugar-candy. It swells up, and is converted into a brown substance\r\ncalled caramel, when heated, and by contact with fermenting substances,\r\nyields alcohol and carbonic acid. It contains--\r\n\r\n     Carbon    42.22\r\n     Hydrogen   6.60\r\n     Oxygen    51.18\r\n              ------\r\n              100.00\r\n\r\nand its chemical formula is C_{12}H_{11}O_{11}.\r\n\r\n_Grape Sugar_ is met with in the grape, and most other fruits, as well\r\nas in honey. It is produced artificially when starch is boiled for a\r\nlong time with sulphuric acid, or treated with a large quantity of\r\ndiastase. It is less soluble in water than cane sugar, and crystallises\r\nin small round grains. Its composition, when dried at 284 deg., is--\r\n\r\n     Carbon    40.00\r\n     Hydrogen   6.66\r\n     Oxygen    53.34\r\n              ------\r\n              100.00\r\n\r\nand its formula is C_{12}H_{12}O_{12}; but when crystallised it contains\r\ntwo equivalents of water, and is then represented by the formula\r\nC_{12}H_{12}O_{12} + 2H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nThe uncrystallisable sugar of plants is closely allied to grape sugar,\r\nand, so far as at present known, has the same composition, although,\r\nfrom the difficulty of obtaining it quite free from crystallised sugar,\r\nthis is still uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Mucilage_ is the name applied to the substance existing in linseed,\r\nand in many other seeds, and which communicates to them the property of\r\nswelling up and becoming gelatinous when treated with water. It is found\r\nin a state of considerable purity in gum tragacanth and some other gums.\r\nIts composition is not known with absolute certainty, but it is either\r\nC_{24}H_{19}O_{19}, or C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}; and in the latter case it\r\nmust be identical with starch and gum.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all the substances belonging to this class are\r\nvery closely related in chemical composition, some of them, as starch\r\nand gum, though easily distinguished by their properties, being\r\nidentical in constitution, while others only differ in the quantity of\r\nwater, or of its elements which they contain. In fact, they may all be\r\nconsidered as compounds of carbon and water, and their relations are,\r\nperhaps, more distinctly seen when their formulae are written so as to\r\nshow this, as is done in the following table, in the second column of\r\nwhich those containing twelve equivalents of carbon are doubled, so as\r\nto make them comparable with cellulose:--\r\n\r\n                                                            Water.\r\nGrape sugar,   C_{12}H_{12}O_{12}   C_{24}H_{24}O_{24}   C_{24} + 24\r\nCane sugar,    C_{12}H_{11}O_{11}   C_{24}H_{22}O_{22}   C_{24} + 22\r\nCellulose,     C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24} + 21\r\nInuline,       C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}   C_{24} + 21\r\nStarch,        C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20\r\nDextrine,      C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20\r\nGum,           C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20\r\nMucilage,      C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}   C_{24}H_{20}O_{20}   C_{24} + 20\r\n\r\nThe relation between these substances being so close, it is not\r\ndifficult to understand how one may be converted into another by the\r\naddition or subtraction of water. Thus, cellulose has only to absorb an\r\nequivalent of water to become grape sugar, or to lose an equivalent in\r\norder to be converted into starch, and we shall afterwards see that\r\nsuch changes do actually occur in the plant during the process of\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\n_Pectine and Pectic Acid._--These substances are met with in many fruits\r\nand roots, as, for instance, in the apple, the carrot, and the turnip.\r\nThey differ from the starch group in containing more oxygen than is\r\nrequired to form water along with their hydrogen; but their exact\r\ncomposition is still uncertain, and they undergo numerous changes during\r\nthe ripening of the fruit.\r\n\r\n_2d. Oily or Fatty Matters._--The oily constituents of plants form a\r\nrather extensive group of substances all closely allied, but\r\ndistinguished by minor differences in properties and constitution. Some\r\nof them are very widely distributed throughout the vegetable kingdom,\r\nbut others are almost peculiar to individual plants. They are all\r\ncompounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are at once distinguished\r\nfrom the preceding class, by containing much less oxygen than is\r\nrequired to form water with their hydrogen. The principal constituents\r\nof the fatty matters and oils of plants are three substances, called\r\nstearine, margarine, and oleine, the two former solids, the latter a\r\nfluid; and they rarely, if ever, occur alone, but are mixed together in\r\nvariable proportions, and the fluidity of the oils is due principally to\r\nthe quantity of the last which they contain. If olive oil be exposed to\r\ncold, it is seen to become partially solid; and if it be then pressed, a\r\nfluid flows out, and a crystalline substance remains; the former is\r\noleine, though not absolutely pure, and the latter margarine. The\r\nperfect separation of these substances involves a variety of troublesome\r\nchemical processes; and when it has been effected, it is found that each\r\nof them is a compound of a peculiar acid, with another substance having\r\na sweet taste, and which has received the name of glycerine, or the\r\nsweet principle of oil. Glycerine, as it exists in the fats, appears to\r\nbe a compound of C_{3}H_{2}O, and its properties are the same from\r\nwhatever source it is obtained. The acids separated from it are known by\r\nthe names of margaric, stearic, and oleic acids.\r\n\r\n_Margaric Acid_ is best obtained pure by boiling olive oil with an\r\nalkali until it is saponified, and decomposing the soap with an acid,\r\nexpressing the margaric acid, which separates, and crystallising it from\r\nalcohol. It is a white crystalline fusible solid, insoluble in water,\r\nbut soluble in alcohol and in solutions of the alkalies. Its composition\r\nis--\r\n\r\n     Carbon     75.56\r\n     Hydrogen   12.59\r\n     Oxygen     11.85\r\n               ------\r\n               100.00\r\n\r\nand its formula C_{34}H_{34}O_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Stearic Acid._--Although this acid exists in many plants, it is most\r\nconveniently extracted from lard. It is a crystalline solid less fusible\r\nthan margaric acid, but closely resembling it in its other properties.\r\nIts formula is C_{36}H_{36}O_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Oleic Acid._--Under this name two different substances appear to be\r\nincluded. It has been applied generally to the fluid acids of all oils,\r\nwhile it would appear that the drying and non-drying oils actually\r\ncontain substances of different composition. The acid extracted from\r\nolive oil appears to have the formula C_{36}H_{34}O_{4}, while that from\r\nlinseed oil is C_{46}H_{38}O_{6}, but this is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nOther fatty acids have been detected in palm oil, cocoa-nut oil, &c.\r\n&c., which so closely resemble margaric and stearic acids as to be\r\neasily confounded with them. Though presenting many points of interest,\r\nit is unnecessary to describe them in detail here.\r\n\r\n_Wax_ is a substance closely allied to the oils. It consists of two\r\nsubstances, cerine and myricine, which are separated from one another by\r\nboiling alcohol, in which the former is more soluble. They are extremely\r\ncomplex in composition, the former consisting principally of an acid\r\nsimilar to the fatty acids, called cerotic acid, and containing\r\nC_{54}H_{54}O_{4}. The latter has the formula C_{92}H_{92}O_{4}. The wax\r\nfound in the leaves of the lilac and other plants appears to consist of\r\nmyricine, while that extracted from the sugar-cane is said to be\r\ndifferent, and to have the formula C_{48}H_{50}O_{2}. It is probable\r\nthat other plants contain different sorts of wax, but their\r\ninvestigation is still so incomplete, that nothing definite can be said\r\nregarding them. Wax and fats appear to be produced in the plant from\r\nstarch and sugar; at least it is unquestionable that the bee is capable\r\nof producing the former from sugar, and we shall afterwards see that a\r\nsimilar change is most probably produced in the plant. The fatty matters\r\ncontained in animals are identical with those of plants.\r\n\r\n_3d. Nitrogenous or Albuminous Constituents of Plants and Animals._--The\r\nnitrogenous constituents of plants and animals are so closely allied,\r\nboth in properties and composition, that they may be most advantageously\r\nconsidered together.\r\n\r\n_Albumen._--Vegetable albumen is found dissolved in the juices of most\r\nplants, and is abundant in that of the potato, the turnip, and wheat. In\r\nthese juices it exists in a soluble state, but when its solution is\r\nheated to about 150 deg., it coagulates into a flocky insoluble substance.\r\nIt is also thrown down by acids and alcohol. Coagulated albumen is\r\nsoluble in alkalies and in nitric acid. Animal albumen exists in the\r\nwhite of eggs, the serum of blood, and the juice of flesh; and from all\r\nthese sources is scarcely distinguishable in its properties from\r\nvegetable albumen.\r\n\r\nIt is a substance of very complicated composition, and chemists are not\r\nagreed as to the formula by which its constitution is to be expressed, a\r\ndifficulty which occurs also with most of the other nitrogenous\r\ncompounds. The results of the analyses of albumen from different sources\r\nare however quite identical, as may be seen from those subjoined--\r\n\r\n             From    From       From    From\r\n             Wheat.  Potatoes.  Blood.  White of Egg.\r\nCarbon        53.7    53.1        53.4      53.0\r\nHydrogen       7.1     7.2         7.0       7.1\r\nNitrogen      15.6     ...        15.5      15.6\r\nOxygen      }      {   ...        22.1      22.9\r\nSulphur     } 23.6 {  0.97         1.6       1.1\r\nPhosphorus  }      {   ...         0.4       0.3\r\n             -----               -----     -----\r\n             100.0               100.0     100.0\r\n\r\nClosely allied to vegetable albumen is the substance known by the name\r\nof _glutin_, which is obtained by boiling the gluten of wheat with\r\nalcohol. It appears to be a sort of coagulated albumen, with which its\r\ncomposition completely agrees.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Fibrine._--If a quantity of wheat flour be tied up in a piece\r\nof cloth, and kneaded for some time under water, the starch it contains\r\nis gradually washed out, and there remains a quantity of a glutinous\r\nsubstance called gluten. When this is boiled with alcohol, the _glutin_\r\nabove referred to is extracted, and vegetable fibrine is left. It\r\ndissolves in dilute potash, and on the addition of acetic acid is\r\ndeposited in a pure state. Treated with hydrochloric acid, diluted with\r\nten times its weight of water, it swells up into a jelly-like mass.\r\nWhen boiled or preserved for a long time under water, it cannot be\r\ndistinguished from coagulated albumen.\r\n\r\n_Animal Fibrine_ exists in the blood and the muscles, and agrees in all\r\nits characters and composition with vegetable fibrine, as is shown by\r\nthe subjoined analyses--\r\n\r\n             Wheat Flour.     Blood.    Flesh.\r\nCarbon         53.1            52.5      53.3\r\nHydrogen        7.0             6.9       7.1\r\nNitrogen       15.6            15.5      15.3\r\nOxygen         23.2            24.0      23.1\r\nSulphur         1.1             1.1       1.2\r\n              -----           -----     -----\r\n              100.0           100.0     100.0\r\n\r\n_Caseine._--Vegetable caseine exists abundantly in most plants,\r\nespecially in the seeds, and remains in the juice after albumen has been\r\nprecipitated by heat, from which it may be separated in flocks by the\r\naddition of an acid. It has been obtained for chemical examination,\r\nprincipally from peas and beans, and from the almond and oats. When\r\nprepared from the pea it has been called _legumine,_ from almonds\r\n_emulsine_, and from oats _avenine_; but they are all three identical in\r\ntheir properties, although formerly believed to be different, and\r\ndistinguished by these names. Vegetable caseine is best obtained by\r\ntreating peas or beans with hot water, and straining the fluid. On\r\nstanding, the starch held in suspension is deposited, and the caseine is\r\nretained in solution in the alkaline fluid; by the addition of an acid\r\nit is precipitated as a thick curd. Caseine is insoluble in water, but\r\ndissolves readily in alkalies; its solution is not coagulated by heat,\r\nbut, on evaporation, becomes covered with a thin pellicle, which is\r\nrenewed as often as it is removed.\r\n\r\n_Animal Caseine_ is the principal constituent of milk, and is obtained\r\nby the cautious addition of an acid to skimmed milk, by which it is\r\nprecipitated as a thick white curd. It is also obtained by the use of\r\nrennet, and the process of curding milk is simply the coagulation of its\r\ncaseine. It is soluble in alkalies, and precipitated from its solution\r\nby acids, and in all other respects agrees with vegetable caseine.\r\n\r\nThe composition of animal caseine has been well ascertained, but\r\nconsiderable doubt still exists as to that of vegetable caseine, owing\r\nto the difficulty of obtaining it absolutely pure. The analyses of\r\ndifferent chemists give rather discordant results, but we have given\r\nthose which appear most trustworthy--\r\n\r\n                      From Peas.\r\n     Carbon          50.6    50.7\r\n     Hydrogen         6.8     6.6\r\n     Nitrogen        16.5    15.8\r\n     Oxygen          25.6    23.8\r\n     Sulphur          0.5     0.8\r\n     Phosphorus       ...     2.3\r\n                    -----   -----\r\n                    100.0   100.0\r\n\r\nOther results differ considerably from these, and some observers have\r\neven obtained as much as eighteen per cent of nitrogen and fifty-three\r\nof carbon.\r\n\r\nThe composition of animal caseine differs from this principally in the\r\namount of carbon. Its composition is--\r\n\r\n     Carbon       53.6\r\n     Hydrogen      7.1\r\n     Nitrogen     15.8\r\n     Oxygen       22.5\r\n     Sulphur       1.0\r\n                 -----\r\n                 100.0\r\n\r\nThe most cursory examination of these analytical numbers is sufficient\r\nto show that a very close relation subsists between the different\r\nsubstances just described. Indeed, with the exception of vegetable\r\ncaseine, they may be said all to present the same composition; and, as\r\nalready mentioned, there are analyses of it which would class it\r\ncompletely with the others. While, however, the quantities of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are the same, differences exist in the\r\nsulphur and phosphorus they contain, and which, though very small in\r\nquantity, are indubitably essential to them. Much importance has been\r\nattributed to these constituents by various chemists, and especially by\r\nMulder, who has endeavoured to make out that all the albuminous\r\nsubstances are compounds of a substance to which he has given the name\r\nof _proteine_, with different quantities of sulphur and phosphorus. The\r\ncomposition of proteine, according to his newest experiments, is--\r\n\r\n     Carbon       54.0\r\n     Hydrogen      7.1\r\n     Nitrogen     16.0\r\n     Oxygen       21.4\r\n     Sulphur       1.5\r\n                 -----\r\n                 100.0\r\n\r\nand is exactly the same from whatever albuminous compound it is\r\nobtained. Although the importance of proteine is probably not so great\r\nas Mulder supposed, it affords an important illustration of the close\r\nsimilarity of the different substances from which it is obtained, the\r\nmore especially as there is every reason to believe that the different\r\nalbuminous compounds are capable of changing into one another, just as\r\nstarch and sugar are mutually convertible; and the possibility of this\r\nchange throws much light on many of the phenomena of nutrition in plants\r\nand animals. Indeed, it would seem probable that these compounds are\r\nformed from their elements by plants only, and are merely assimilated by\r\nanimals to produce the nitrogenous constituents they contain.\r\n\r\n_Diastase_ is the name applied to a substance existing in malt, and\r\nobtained by macerating that substance with cold water, and adding a\r\nquantity of alcohol to the fluid, when the diastase is immediately\r\nprecipitated in white flocks. It is produced during the malting process,\r\nand is not found in the unmalted barley. Its chemical composition is\r\nunknown, but it is nitrogenous, and is believed to be produced by the\r\ndecomposition of gluten. If a very small quantity of diastase be mixed\r\nwith starch suspended in hot water, the starch is found gradually to\r\ndissolve, and to pass first into the state of dextrine, then into that\r\nof sugar. The change thus effected takes place also in a precisely\r\nsimilar manner in the plant, diastase being produced during the process\r\nof germination of all seeds and tubers, for the purpose of effecting\r\nthis change, and to fulfil other functions less understood, but no doubt\r\nequally important. Diastase is found in the seeds only during the period\r\nwhen the starch they contain is passing into sugar; as soon as that\r\nchange has taken place, its function is ended, and it disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE FOOD OF PLANTS DURING THEIR GROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simple compounds which the plant absorbs from the atmosphere and\r\nsoil are elaborated within its system, and converted into the various\r\ncomplex substances of which its tissues are composed, by a series of\r\nchanges, the details of which are still in some respects imperfectly\r\nknown, although their general nature is sufficiently well understood.\r\nThey may be best rendered intelligible by reference, in the first\r\ninstance, to the changes occurring during germination, when the young\r\nplant is nourished by a supply of food stored up in the seed, in\r\nsufficient quantity to maintain its existence until the organs by which\r\nit is afterwards to draw its nutriment from the air and soil are\r\nsufficiently developed to serve that purpose.\r\n\r\n_Changes occurring during Germination._--When a seed is placed in the\r\nsoil under favourable circumstances, it becomes the seat of an important\r\nand remarkable series of chemical changes, which result in the\r\nproduction of the young plant. Experiment and observation have shown\r\nthat heat, moisture, and air, are necessary to the production of these\r\nchanges, and though probably not absolutely essential, the absence of\r\nlight is favourable in the early stages. The temperature required for\r\ngermination varies greatly in different seeds, some germinating readily\r\nat a few degrees above the freezing point, and others requiring a\r\ntolerably high temperature. The rapidity with which it takes place\r\nappears to increase with the temperature; but this is true only within\r\nvery narrow limits, for beyond a certain point heat is injurious, and\r\nwhen it exceeds 120 deg. or 130 deg. Fahrenheit, entirely prevents the process.\r\nThe presence of oxygen is also essential, for it has been shown that if\r\nseeds are placed in a soil exposed to an atmosphere deprived of that\r\nelement, or if they be buried so deep that the air does not reach them,\r\nthey may lie without change for an unlimited period; but so soon as they\r\nare exposed to the air, germination immediately commences. Illustrations\r\nof this fact are frequently observed where earth from a considerable\r\ndepth has been thrown up to the surface, when it often becomes covered\r\nwith plants not usually seen in the neighbourhood, which have sprung\r\nfrom buried seeds. When all the necessary conditions for germination are\r\nfulfilled, the seed absorbs moisture, swells up, and sends out a shoot\r\nwhich rises to the surface, and a radicle which descends--the one\r\ndestined to develop the leaves, the other the roots, by which the plant\r\nis afterwards to derive its nutriment from the air and the soil. But\r\nuntil these organs are properly developed, the plant is dependent on the\r\nmatters contained in the seed itself. These substances are mostly\r\ninsoluble, but are brought into solution by the atmospheric oxygen\r\nacting upon the gluten, and converting it into a soluble substance\r\ncalled diastase, which in its turn reacts upon the starch, converting it\r\nfirst into dextrine, and then into cellulose, and the latter is finally\r\ndeposited in the form of organised cells, and produces the first little\r\nshoot of the plant. At the first moment of germination, the oxygen\r\nabsorbed appears simply to oxidize the constituents of the seed, but\r\nthis condition exists only for a very limited period, and is soon\r\nfollowed by the evolution of carbonic acid, water being at the same time\r\nformed from the organic constituents of the seed, which gradually\r\ndiminishes in weight. The amount of this diminution is different with\r\ndifferent plants, but always considerable. Boussingault found that the\r\nloss of dry substance in the pea amounted in 26 days to 52 per cent, and\r\nin wheat to 57 per cent in 51 days. Against this, of course, is to be\r\nput the weight of the young plant produced; but this is never sufficient\r\nto counterbalance the diminished weight of the seed, for Saussure found\r\nthat a horse bean and the plant produced from it weighed, after 16 days,\r\nless by 29 per cent than the seed before germination. The same\r\nphenomenon is observed in the process of malting, which is in fact the\r\nartificial germination of barley, the malt produced always weighing\r\nconsiderably less than the grain from which it was obtained. It was\r\nbelieved by Saussure, and the older investigators, that the carbonic\r\nacid evolved was entirely produced from starch and sugar; and as these\r\nsubstances may be viewed as compounds of carbon and water, the change\r\nwas very simply explained by supposing that the carbon was oxidised and\r\nconverted into carbonic acid and its water eliminated. But this\r\nhypothesis is incapable of explaining all the phenomena observed; for\r\nwoody fibre, which is one of the chief constituents of the young plant,\r\ncontains more carbon than the starch and sugar from which it must have\r\nbeen produced, and we are, therefore, forced to admit that the action\r\nmust be more complicated. There is every reason to believe that the\r\nnitrogenous constituents of the seed are most abundantly oxidized, for\r\nthey are remarkably prone to change; but the action of the air is not\r\nconfined to them, and it appears most probable that all the substances\r\ntake part in the decomposition, and the process of germination may, in\r\nsome respects, be compared to decay or putrefaction, which, like it, is\r\nattended by the absorption of oxygen and evolution of carbonic acid; but\r\nwhile in the latter case the residual substances remain in a useless\r\nstate, in the former they at once become part of a new organism.\r\n\r\n_Changes occurring during the After-growth of the Plant._--When the\r\nplant has developed its roots and leaves, and exhausted the store of\r\nmaterials laid up for it in the seed, it begins to derive its\r\nsubsistence from the surrounding air, and to absorb carbonic acid,\r\nwater, ammonia, and nitric acid, and to decompose and convert them into\r\nthe different constituents of its tissues. These changes take place\r\nslowly at first, and more rapidly as the organs fitted for the\r\nelaboration of its food are developed. The roots and the leaves are\r\nequally active in performing this duty, the former absorbing the mineral\r\nmatters along with the carbonic acid, ammonia, nitric acid, and moisture\r\nin the soil, or the manure added to it; the latter gathering the gaseous\r\nsubstances existing in the air. Each of these undergoes a series of\r\nchanges claiming our consideration.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Carbonic Acid._--Carbonic acid, which appears to be\r\nabsorbed with equal readiness by the roots, leaves, and stems, undergoes\r\nimmediate decomposition, its carbon being retained, and its oxygen, in\r\nwhole or in part, evolved into the air. This decomposition occurs only\r\nunder the action of the sun's rays, and has been found to be\r\nproportionate to the amount of light to which the plant is exposed. It\r\ntakes place only in the green parts of plants, for though the roots\r\nabsorb carbonic acid, they cannot decompose it, or evolve oxygen; and\r\nthe coloured parts, the flowers, fruits, etc., have an entirely opposite\r\neffect, absorbing oxygen and giving off carbonic acid. The absorption of\r\ncarbonic acid and escape of oxygen has been proved by numerous direct\r\nexperiments by Saussure and others, in which both atmospheric air and\r\nartificial mixtures containing an increased quantity of carbonic acid\r\nhave been employed. Saussure allowed seven plants of periwinkle (_Vinca\r\nminor_) to vegetate in an atmosphere containing 7.5 per cent of carbonic\r\nacid for six days, during each of which the apparatus was exposed for\r\nsix hours to the sun's rays. The air was analysed both before and after\r\nthe experiment, and the results obtained were--\r\n\r\n                        Volume                              Carbonic\r\n                        of the air.   Nitrogen.   Oxygen.   Acid.\r\nBefore the experiment,   5746           4199       1116       431\r\nAfter       \"            5746           4338       1408         0\r\n                         ----           ----       ----      ----\r\nDifference,                 0           +139       +292      -431\r\n\r\nIn this experiment the whole of the carbonic acid, amounting to 431\r\nvolumes, was absorbed, but only 292 volumes of oxygen were given off.\r\nHad the carbonic acid been entirely decomposed, and all its oxygen\r\neliminated, its volume would have been equal to that of the acid, or\r\n431, so that in this instance 139 volumes of the oxygen of the carbonic\r\nacid have been retained to form part of the tissues of the plant. On the\r\nother hand, the nitrogen is found to be increased after the experiment.\r\nIt might be supposed that the nitrogen evolved had been derived from the\r\ndecomposition of the nitrogenous constituents of the plant, but this\r\ncannot be the true explanation, because in this particular case it\r\ngreatly exceeded the whole nitrogen contained in the plants\r\nexperimented on. Its source is not well understood, but Boussingault\r\nsupposes it to have existed in the interstices of the plant, and to have\r\nescaped during the course of the experiment. Saussure found that the\r\noak, the horse-chesnut, and other plants, absorb oxygen and give off\r\ncarbonic acid in less volumes than the oxygen, while the house-leek and\r\nthe cactus absorb oxygen without evolving carbonic acid. The absorption\r\nand decomposition of carbonic acid takes place only during the day, and\r\nmatters are entirely reversed during the night, when oxygen is absorbed\r\nand carbonic acid eliminated from all parts of the plants.\r\n\r\nAlthough the action occurring during the night is the reverse of that\r\nwhich takes place during the day, it is in no degree to be attributed to\r\na re-oxidation of the carbon which had been deposited in the tissues of\r\nthe plant. It appears, on the contrary, to be a purely mechanical, and\r\nnot a chemical process. During the night the sap continues to circulate\r\nthrough the vessels of the plant, and moisture, carrying with it\r\ncarbonic acid in solution, is absorbed by the roots; but when it reaches\r\nthe leaves, where the sun's light would have caused its decomposition\r\nduring the day, it is again exhaled unchanged. The oxygen absorbed\r\nduring the night must, however, take part in some chemical processes,\r\nfor if it were merely mechanical, the absorption would not be confined\r\nto that gas alone, but would be participated in by the other\r\nconstituents of the air. Moreover, the amount of absorption varies\r\ngreatly in different plants--being scarcely appreciable in some, and\r\nvery abundant in others. Plants containing volatile oils, which are\r\nreadily converted into resins by the action of oxygen, or those\r\ncontaining tannin or other readily oxidizable substances, take up the\r\nlargest quantity. This is remarkably illustrated by an experiment in\r\nwhich the leaves of the Agave americana, after twenty-four hours'\r\nexposure in the dark, were found to have absorbed only 0.3 of their\r\nvolume of oxygen, while those of the fir, in which volatile oil is\r\nabundant, had taken up twice, and those of the oak, containing tannin,\r\neighteen times as much oxygen.\r\n\r\nIn the flowers, both by day and night, there is a constant absorption of\r\noxygen, and evolution of carbonic acid. In fact, an active oxidation is\r\ngoing on, attended by the evolution of heat, which, in the _Arum\r\nmaculatum_ and some other plants, is so great as to raise the\r\ntemperature of the flower 10 deg. or 12 deg. above that of the surrounding air.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Water in the Plant._--In addition to the function\r\nwhich water performs in the plant, as the solvent of the different\r\nsubstances which form its nutriment, and hence as the medium through\r\nwhich they pass into its organs, it serves also as a direct food,\r\nundergoing decomposition, and yielding hydrogen to the organic\r\nsubstances. Its constituents, along with those of the carbonic acid\r\nabsorbed, undergo a variety of transformations, and form the principal\r\npart of the non-nitrogenous constituents. It has been already observed\r\nthat starch, sugar, and the other allied substances, may be considered\r\nas compounds of carbon with water; and they might be supposed to owe\r\ntheir origin to the carbonic acid losing the whole of its oxygen, and\r\ndirect combination then ensuing between the residual carbon and a\r\ncertain proportion of water; but this would imply that the latter\r\nsubstance undergoes no decomposition, and though undoubtedly the\r\nsimplest view of the case, it is by no means the most probable. It is\r\nmuch more likely that the carbonic acid is only partially decomposed,\r\nhalf its oxygen being separated, and replaced by hydrogen, produced by\r\nthe decomposition of a certain quantity of water into its elements.\r\nThus, for instance, sugar may be produced from twelve equivalents of\r\ncarbonic acid and twelve equivalents of water, twenty-four equivalents\r\nof oxygen being eliminated, as thus represented:\r\n\r\n12 equivalents of carbonic acid,  C_{12}O_{12}O_{12}\r\n12  \"  water,                     H_{12}O_{12}\r\n 1  \"  sugar, and 24 of ox.       C_{12}H_{12}O_{12} + O_{24}\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that we are in a condition to assert that sugar\r\nis really produced in the manner here shown, the illustration being\r\ngiven merely for the purpose of pointing out how it may be supposed to\r\noccur, and on a similar principle it is possible to explain the\r\nformation of most other vegetable compounds; and this subject has been\r\nvery fully discussed by the late Dr. Gregory, in his \"Handbook of\r\nOrganic Chemistry.\" That water must be decomposed, is evident from the\r\nfact, established by analysis, that the hydrogen of the plant generally\r\nexceeds the quantity required to form water with its oxygen, so that\r\nthis excess at least must be produced by the decomposition of water. The\r\nhydrogen of the volatile oils, many of which contain no oxygen, and that\r\nof the fats, which contain only a small quantity, must manifestly be\r\nobtained in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Ammonia._--The nitrogenous or albuminous compounds of\r\nvegetables must necessarily obtain their nitrogen from the decomposition\r\neither of ammonia or nitric acid, experiment having distinctly shown\r\nthat they are incapable of absorbing it in the free state from the\r\natmosphere. It has been clearly ascertained that the albuminous\r\nsubstances do not contain ammonia, and it is hence apparent that a\r\ncomplete decomposition of that substance must take place in the plant.\r\nNo doubt carbonic acid and water take part with it in these changes,\r\nwhich must be of a very complex character, and in the present state of\r\nour knowledge it seems hopeless to attempt any explanation of them.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Nitric Acid._--Chemists are not entirely at one as to\r\nwhether nitric acid is directly absorbed by the plant, or is first\r\nconverted into ammonia. But there are certain facts connected with the\r\nchemistry of the soil, to be afterwards referred to, which seem to us to\r\nleave no doubt that it may be directly absorbed; and in that case it\r\nmust be decomposed, its oxygen being eliminated, and the nitrogen taking\r\npart with carbon and hydrogen in the formation of the organic compounds.\r\nIt must be clearly understood that while such changes as those described\r\nmanifestly must take place, the explanations of them which have been\r\nattempted by various chemists are not to be accepted as determinately\r\nestablished _facts_; they are at present no more than hypothetical views\r\nwhich have been expressed chiefly with the intention of presenting some\r\ndefinite idea to the mind, and are unsupported by absolute proof; they\r\nare only inferences drawn from the general bearings of known facts, and\r\nnot facts themselves. Although, therefore, they are to be received with\r\ncaution, they have advantages in so far as they present the matter to us\r\nin a somewhat more tangible form than the vague general statements which\r\nare all that could otherwise be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen treating of the general constituents of plants, it has been already\r\nstated that the older chemists and vegetable physiologists, misled by\r\nthe small quantity of ash found in them, entertained the opinion that\r\nmineral matters were purely fortuitous components of vegetables, and\r\nwere present merely because they had been dissolved and absorbed along\r\nwith the humus, which was then supposed to enter the roots in solution,\r\nand to form the chief food of the plant. This supposition, which could\r\nonly be sustained at a time when analysis was imperfect, has been long\r\nsince disproved and abandoned, and it has been distinctly shown by\r\nrepeated experiment that not only are these inorganic substances\r\nnecessary to the plant, but that every one of them, however small its\r\nquantity, must be present if it is to grow luxuriantly and arrive at a\r\nhealthy maturity. The experiments of Prince Salm Horstmar, before\r\nalluded to, have established beyond a doubt, that while a seed may\r\ngerminate, and even grow, to a certain extent, in absence of one or more\r\nof the constituents of its ash, it remains sickly and stunted, and is\r\nincapable of producing either flower or seed.\r\n\r\nOf late years the analysis of the ash of different plants has formed the\r\nsubject of a large number of laborious investigations, by which our\r\nknowledge of this subject has been greatly extended. From these it\r\nappears that the quantity of ash contained in each plant or part of a\r\nplant is tolerably uniform, differing only within comparatively narrow\r\nlimits, and that there is a special proportion belonging to each\r\nindividual organ of the plant. This fact may be best rendered obvious by\r\nthe subjoined table, showing the quantity of ash contained in a hundred\r\nparts of the different substances dried at 212 deg.. Most of these numbers\r\nare the mean of several experiments:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table showing the quantity of inorganic matters in 100 parts of\r\ndifferent plants dried at 212

variety in the proportion of ash in different plants, some\r\ngeneral relations may be traced. A certain similarity may be observed\r\nbetween those belonging to the same natural family, the seeds of all the\r\ncereal grains, for instance, containing in round numbers two per cent of\r\ninorganic matters. Leguminous seeds (peas and beans) contain about three\r\nper cent, while in rape-seed, linseed, and the other oily seeds, it\r\nreaches four per cent. In the stems and straws less uniformity exists,\r\nbut with the exception of a few extreme cases, the quantity of ash in\r\ngeneral approaches pretty closely to five per cent. Still more\r\ndiversified results are obtained from the entire plants; but this\r\ndiversity is probably much more apparent than real, and must be, in part\r\nat least, dependent on the proportion existing between the stem and\r\nleaves, for the leaves are peculiarly rich in ash, and a leafy plant\r\nmust necessarily yield a higher total percentage of ash, although, if\r\nstems and leaves were separately examined, they might not show so\r\nconspicuous a difference.\r\n\r\nThe leaves surpass all other parts of plants, in the proportion of\r\ninorganic constituents they contain, the table showing that in some\r\ninstances, as in the maple and Jerusalem artichoke, they exceed\r\none-fourth of the whole weight of the dry matter. In other leaves, and\r\nmore especially in those of the coniferae, the proportion is much\r\nsmaller. Taking the average of all the analyses hitherto made, it\r\nappears that leaves contain about thirteen per cent of ash, but the\r\nvariations on either side are so large that little value is to be\r\nattached to it except as an indication of the general abundance of\r\nmineral matters.\r\n\r\nIn roots and tubers the variations are less, and all, except the potato\r\nand the turnip, contain about seven per cent of ash.\r\n\r\nThe smallest proportion of mineral matter is found in wood. In one case\r\nonly does the proportion reach five per cent, while the average scarcely\r\nexceeds one, and in the fir the quantity amounts to no more than one\r\nsix-hundredth of the dry matter. In the bark the quantity is much\r\nlarger, and may be stated at seven per cent.\r\n\r\nThe general proportion of ash found in different parts of plants is\r\ngiven in round numbers in the subjoined table:--\r\n\r\nWood                1\r\nSeeds               3\r\nStems and straws    5\r\nRoots and tubers    7\r\nBark                7\r\nLeaves             13\r\n\r\nThe differences in the quantity of ash contained in different parts of\r\nplants are obviously intended to serve a useful purpose, and it is\r\ninteresting to observe that the wood which is destined to remain for a\r\nlong period, sometimes for several centuries, a part of the plant,\r\ncontains the smallest proportion, and it is not improbable that what it\r\ndoes contain is really due, not to the actual woody matter itself, but\r\nto the sap which permeates its vessels. By this arrangement but a small\r\nproportion of these important mineral matters, which the soil supplies\r\nin very limited quantity, is locked up within the plant, and those which\r\nare absorbed, after circulating through it, and fulfilling their\r\nallotted functions, are accumulated in the leaves, and annually returned\r\nto the soil.\r\n\r\nThe different proportions of mineral matters contained in the individual\r\norgans of plants is most strikingly illustrated when parallel\r\nexperiments are made on the same species; but the number of instances in\r\nwhich a sufficiently extensive series of analyses has been made to show\r\nthis, is comparatively limited, and is confined to the oat, the\r\norange-tree, and the horse chesnut--each of which has formed the subject\r\nof a very elaborate investigation. The following table gives the results\r\nobtained on the oat:--\r\n\r\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+\r\n|             | Hopetoun  | Hopetoun| Potato    | Black | Sandy |      |\r\n|             | Oats,     | Oats,   | Oats,     | Oats, | Oats, | Mean.|\r\n|             | North-    | Fife-   | North-    | Edin- | Fife- |      |\r\n|             | umberland.| shire.  | umberland.| burgh.| shire.|      |\r\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+\r\n| Grain       |    2.14   |  1.81   |    2.22   |  2.11 |  1.76 |  2.00|\r\n| Husk        |    6.47   |  6.03   |    6.99   |  8.24 |  6.03 |  6.75|\r\n| Chaff       |   16.53   | 17.23   |   15.59   | 19.19 | 18.97 | 16.06|\r\n| Leaves      |    8.44   |  7.19   |   14.59   | 10.29 | 15.92 | 10.88|\r\n| Upper part  |           |         |           |       |       |      |\r\n|   of straw  |    4.95   |  5.44   |    9.22   |  8.25 | 11.0  |  7.77|\r\n| Middle part |           |         |           |       |       |      |\r\n|   of straw  |    6.11   |  5.23   |    7.41   |  6.53 |  9.01 |  6.66|\r\n| Lower part  |           |         |           |       |       |      |\r\n|   of straw  |    5.33   |  5.18   |    9.76   |  7.11 |  7.30 |  6.93|\r\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+-------+------+\r\n\r\nThe specimens of oats on which these analyses were made were from\r\ndifferent districts of country, grown on soils of different quality, and\r\nwere, further, of different varieties; and yet they show, on the whole,\r\na remarkable similarity in the proportion of ash in each part, and\r\nindicate that there is a normal quantity belonging to it. Such a series\r\nof analyses also affords the most convincing proof that the inorganic\r\nmatters cannot be fortuitous, and merely absorbed from the soil along\r\nwith their organic food, as the old chemists supposed, because, in that\r\ncase, they ought to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire\r\nplant, and not accumulated in particular proportions in each individual\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nNot only does the proportion of ash vary in the different parts of a\r\nplant, but even in the same part it is greatly influenced by its period\r\nof growth. The laws which regulate these variations are very imperfectly\r\nknown, but in general it is observed that during the period of active\r\ngrowth the quantity of ash is largest. Thus, it has been found that in\r\nearly spring the wood of the young shoots of the horse-chesnut contains\r\n9.9 per cent of ash. In autumn this has diminished to 3.4, and the last\r\nyear's twigs contain only 1.1 per cent, while in the old wood the\r\nquantity does not exceed 0.5. Saussure has also observed that the\r\nquantity of ash diminishes in certain plants when the seed has ripened.\r\nThus, he found that the percentages of ash, before flowering, and after\r\nseeding, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n               Before flowering.

In the grain only is there a diminution, but this is\r\napparent and not real, and is due to the fact that the determination of\r\nthe quantity of ash, as made on the grain with its husk, and the former,\r\nwhich contains only a small quantity of mineral matters, increases much\r\nmore rapidly in weight than the latter, when it approaches the period of\r\nripening, and it is accordingly during the last three weeks of its\r\ngrowth that this diminution becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil has also a very important influence on the\r\nproportion of mineral matters, and of this an interesting illustration\r\nis given in the following table, which shows the quantities found in the\r\ngrain and straw of the same variety of the pea grown on fourteen\r\ndifferent soils:--\r\n\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n|    | Seed. | Straw. |\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n|  1 |  2.30 |        |\r\n|  2 |  3.25 |  3.43  |\r\n|  3 |  4.27 |  3.62  |\r\n|  4 |  3.40 |  3.39  |\r\n|  5 |  2.99 |  3.90  |\r\n|  6 |  3.19 |  6.80  |\r\n|  7 |  2.53 |  3.90  |\r\n|  8 |  2.27 |  6.59  |\r\n|  9 |  2.69 |  3.49  |\r\n| 10 |  1.61 |  3.91  |\r\n| 11 |  3.11 |  5.28  |\r\n| 12 |  3.34 |  7.57  |\r\n| 13 |  2.78 |  3.76  |\r\n| 14 |  3.01 |  3.38  |\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n\r\nAlthough those differences are very large, especially in the straw, and\r\nmust be attributed to the soil, it has hitherto been found impossible to\r\nascertain the nature of the relation subsisting between it and the crops\r\nit yields; indeed, it must obviously be dependent on very complicated\r\nquestions, which cannot at present be solved, for it may be observed\r\nthat the increase in the grain does not occur simultaneously with that\r\nin the straw, and in several cases a large proportion of ash in the\r\nformer is associated with an unusually small amount in the latter. _A\r\npriori_, it might be expected that those soils which are especially rich\r\nin the more important constituents of the ash should yield a produce\r\ncontaining more than the average quantity, but this is very far from\r\nbeing an invariable occurrence, and not unfrequently the very reverse\r\nis the case. In some instances the variations may be traced to the soil,\r\nas in the following analyses of the fruit of the horse-chesnut, grown on\r\nan ordinary forest soil, and on a rich soil, produced by the\r\ndisintegration of porphyritic rock, in which the latter yields a much\r\nlarger quantity of ash:--\r\n\r\n                  Kernel of seed.  Green husk.   Brown husk.\r\nForest soil        2.26             4.53          1.70\r\nPorphyry soil      3.36             7.29          2.20\r\n\r\nIn the majority of instances we fail to establish any connection between\r\nthe nature of the soil and the plants it yields, chiefly because we are\r\nstill very deficient in analyses of those grown on uncultivated soils;\r\nand on cultivated land it is impossible to draw conclusions, because the\r\nnature of the manure exerts an influence quite as great, if not greater,\r\nthan that of the soil itself.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportion in which the different mineral matters enter\r\ninto the composition of the ash varies within very wide limits, as will\r\nbe apparent from the following table, containing a selection of the best\r\nanalyses of our common cultivated and a few uncultivated plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table of the Composition of the Ash of different Plants in 100 Parts._\r\n\r\n_Note._--Alumina and oxide of manganese occur so rarely, that

|\r\n+---------------------+-------+------------+-----------+----------+---------+\r\n\r\nA simple inspection of this table leads to various interesting\r\nconclusions. It is particularly to be observed that some of the\r\nconstituents of the ash are not invariably present, and two at\r\nleast--namely, alumina and manganese--are found so rarely as to justify\r\nthe inference that they are not indispensable. Of the other substances,\r\niodine is restricted exclusively to sea-plants, but to them it appears\r\nto be essential. Oxide of iron, which occurs only in small quantities,\r\nhas sometimes been considered fortuitous, but it is almost invariably\r\npresent, and the experiments of Prince Salm Horstmar leave no doubt that\r\nit is essential to the plant. Its function is unknown, but it is an\r\nimportant constituent of the blood of herbivorous animals, and may be\r\npresent in the plant, less for its own benefit than for that of the\r\nanimal of which it is destined to become the food.\r\n\r\nSoda appears to be a comparatively unimportant constituent of the ash,\r\nof which it generally forms but a small proportion, although the\r\ninstances of its entire absence are rare. In the cruciferous plants\r\n(turnip, rape, etc.) it is found abundantly, and to them it appears\r\nindispensable, but in most other plants it admits of replacement by\r\npotash. It seems probable that where the soil is rich in the latter\r\nsubstance, plants will select that alkali in preference to soda; but as\r\nthey must have a certain quantity of alkali, the latter may supply the\r\nplace of the former where it is deficient. Cultivation, probably by\r\nenriching the soil in that element, increases the proportion of potash\r\nfound in the ash of plants, as is remarkably seen in the asparagus,\r\nwhich gave the following quantities of alkalies and chlorine:--\r\n\r\n                Wild.   Cultivated.\r\n     Potash     18.8     50.5\r\n     Soda       16.2     trace.\r\n     Chlorine   16.5      8.3\r\n\r\nThe soda having almost entirely disappeared in the cultivated plant,\r\nwhile a corresponding increase had taken place in the quantity of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nPotash is one of the most important elements of the ash of all plants,\r\nrarely forming less than 20, and sometimes more than 50 per cent of its\r\nweight. The latter proportion occurs chiefly in the roots and tubers,\r\nbut it is also abundant in all seeds and in the grasses. The straw, and\r\nparticularly the chaff of the cereals, and the leaves of most plants,\r\ncontain it in smaller quantity, although exceptions to this are not\r\nunfrequent, one of the most curious being the case of poppy-seed, which\r\ncontains only about 12 per cent, while the leaves yield upwards of 37\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of lime varies within very wide limits, being sometimes\r\nas low as 1, and in other plants reaching 40 per cent of their ash. The\r\nformer proportion occurs in the grains of the cerealia, and the latter\r\nin the leaves of some plants, and more especially in the Jerusalem\r\nartichoke. The turnip and some of the leguminous plants also contain it\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is generally found in small quantity. It is largest in the\r\ngrains, amounting in them to about 12 or 13 per cent of the ash, but in\r\nother plants it varies from 2 to 4 per cent. Although small in quantity,\r\nit is an important substance, and apparently cannot be dispensed with;\r\nat least there is no instance known of its entire absence.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_ is by no means an invariable constituent of the ash, although\r\nit is generally present, and sometimes in considerable quantity. It is\r\nmost abundant when the proportion of soda is large, and exists in the\r\nash principally in combination with that base as common salt. The\r\nrelation between these two elements may be traced more or less\r\ndistinctly throughout the whole table of analyses, and conspicuously in\r\nthat of mangold-wurzel, where the common salt amounts to almost exactly\r\none-half of the whole mineral matter. The analyses of the cultivated and\r\nuncultivated asparagus also show that a diminution in the soda is\r\naccompanied by a reduction in the proportion of chlorine.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric Acid_ is an essential constituent of the ash. But it is to be\r\nobserved that it is in some instances entirely, and in all partially, a\r\nproduct of the combustion to which the plant has been submitted in order\r\nto obtain the ash. It is partly derived from the sulphur contained in\r\nthe albuminous compounds, which is oxidised and converted into sulphuric\r\nacid during the process of burning the organic matter, and remains in\r\nthe ash. The quantity of sulphuric acid found in the ash is, however, no\r\ncriterion of that existing in the plant, for a considerable quantity of\r\nit escapes during burning. The extent to which this occurs in particular\r\ninstances is well illustrated by reference to the case of white mustard,\r\nwhich yields an ash containing only 2.19 of sulphuric acid, equivalent\r\nto 0.9 of sulphur; and if calculated on the seed itself, this will\r\namount to no more than 0.039 per cent, while experiments made in another\r\nmanner prove it to contain about thirty times as much, or more than 1\r\nper cent. For the purpose of determining the total quantity of sulphur\r\nwhich the plants contain in their natural state, it is necessary to\r\noxidise them by means of nitric acid; and from such experiments the\r\nfollowing table, showing the _total_ amount of sulphur contained in 100\r\nparts of different plants, dried at 212 deg., has been constructed:--\r\n\r\n     Poa palustris         0.165\r\n     Lolium perenne        0.310\r\n     Italian Ryegrass      0.329\r\n     Trifolium pratense    0.107\r\n               repens      0.099\r\n     Lucerne               0.336\r\n     Vetch                 0.178\r\n     Potato tuber          0.082\r\n            tops           0.206\r\n     Carrot, root          0.092\r\n         tops              0.745\r\n     Mangold-Wurzel, root  0.058\r\n                    tops   0.502\r\n     Swede, root           0.435\r\n            tops           0.458\r\n     Rape                  0.448\r\n\r\n     Drumhead Cabbage      0.431\r\n     Wheat, grain          0.068\r\n            straw          0.245\r\n     Barley, grain,        0.053\r\n             straw         0.191\r\n     Oats, grain           0.103\r\n           straw           0.289\r\n     Rye, grain            0.051\r\n     Beans                 0.056\r\n     Peas                  0.127\r\n     Lentils               0.110\r\n     Hops                  1.063\r\n     Gold of Pleasure      0.253\r\n     Black Mustard         1.170\r\n     White Mustard         1.050\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid_, which may be looked upon as the most important\r\nmineral constituent of plants, is found to be present in very variable\r\nproportions. The straws, stems, and leaves contain it in comparatively\r\nsmall quantity, but in the seeds of all plants it is very abundant. In\r\nthese of the cereals it constitutes nearly half of their whole mineral\r\ncomponents, and it rarely falls below 30 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic acid_ occurs in very variable quantities in the ash. It is of\r\ncomparatively little importance in itself, and is really produced by the\r\noxidation of part of the carbonaceous matters of the plant; but it has a\r\nspecial interest, in so far as it shows that part of the bases contained\r\nin the plant must in its natural state have been in union with organic\r\nacids, or combined in some way with the organic constituents of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n_Silica_ is an invariable constituent of the ash, but in most plants\r\noccurs but in small quantity. The cereals and grasses form an exception\r\nto this rule, for in them it is an abundant and important element. It is\r\nnot, however, uniformly distributed through them, but is accumulated to\r\na large extent in the stem, to the strength and rigidity of which it\r\ngreatly contributes. The hard shining layer which coats the exterior of\r\nstraw, and which is still more remarkably seen on the surface of the\r\nbamboo, consists chiefly of silica; and in the latter plant this element\r\nis sometimes so largely accumulated, that concretions resembling opal,\r\nand composed entirely of it, are found loose within its joints. The\r\nnecessity for a large supply of silica in the stems of other plants does\r\nnot exist, and in them it rarely exceeds 5 or 6 per cent, but in some\r\nleaves it is more abundant.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the composition of the ash of plants is of considerable\r\nimportance in a practical point of view, and enables us in many\r\ninstances to explain why some plants will not grow upon particular soils\r\non which others flourish. Thus, for instance, a plant which contains a\r\nlarge quantity of lime, such as the bean or turnip, will not grow in a\r\nsoil in which that element is deficient, although wheat or barley, which\r\nrequire but little lime, may yield excellent crops. Again, if the soil\r\nbe deficient in phosphoric acid, those plants only will grow luxuriantly\r\nwhich require but a small quantity of that element, and hence it follows\r\nthat on such a soil plants cultivated for the sake of their stems,\r\nroots, or leaves, in which the quantity of phosphoric acid is small, may\r\nyield a good return; while others, cultivated for the sake of their\r\nseed, in which the great proportion of that constituent of the ash is\r\naccumulated, may yield a very small crop. It is obvious also that even\r\nwhere a soil contains a proper quantity of all its ingredients, the\r\nrepeated cultivation of a plant which removes a large quantity of any\r\nindividual element, may, in the course of time, so far reduce the amount\r\nof that substance as to render the soil incapable of any longer\r\nproducing that plant, although, if it be replaced by another which\r\nrequires but little of the element thus removed, it may again produce an\r\nabundant crop. On this principle also, attempts have been made to\r\nexplain the rotation of crops, which has been supposed to depend on the\r\ncultivation in successive years of plants which abstract from the soil\r\npreponderating quantities of different mineral matters. But though this\r\nhas unquestionably a certain influence, we shall afterwards see reason\r\nto doubt whether it affords a sufficient explanation of all the observed\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, on examining the table of the percentage and\r\nposition of the ash, that some plants are especially rich in alkalies,\r\nwhile in others lime or silica preponderate, and it would therefore be\r\nthe object of the farmer to employ, in succession, crops containing\r\nthese elements in different proportions. In carrying out this view,\r\nattempts have been made to classify different plants under the heads of\r\nsilica plants, lime plants, and potash plants; and the following table,\r\nextracted from Liebig's _Agricultural Chemistry_, in which the\r\nconstituents of the ash are grouped under the three heads of salts of\r\npotash and soda, lime and magnesia, and silica, gives such a\r\nclassification as far as it is at present possible:--\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|                                  | Salts of   | Salts of  | Silica.\r\n|                                  | Potash and | Lime and  |\r\n|                                  | Soda.      | Magnesia. |\r\n|----------------------------------|------------|-----------|---------\r\n|Silica  {  Oat straw with seeds   |  34.00     |   4.00    |  62.00\r\n|Plants. {  Wheat straw            |  22.50     |   7.20    |  61.50\r\n|        {  Barley straw with seeds|  19.00     |  25.70    |  55.30\r\n|        {  Rye straw              |  18.65     |  16.52    |  63.89\r\n|        {  Good hay               |   6.00     |  34.00    |  60.00\r\n|Lime   {  Tobacco                 |  24.34     |  67.44    |   8.30\r\n|Plants {  Pea straw               |  27.82     |  63.74    |   7.81\r\n|       {  Potato plant            |   4.20     |  59.40    |  36.40\r\n|       {  Meadow Clover           |  39.20     |  56.00    |   4.90\r\n|Potash  {  Maize straw            |  72.45     |   6.50    |  18.00\r\n|Plants. {  Turnips                |  81.60     |  18.40    |    --\r\n|        {  Beet root              |  88.00     |  12.00    |    --\r\n|        {  Potatoes               |  85.81     |  14.19    |    --\r\n|        {  Jerusalem Artichoke    |  84.30     |  15.70    |    --\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe special application of these facts must be reserved till we come to\r\ntreat of the rotation of crops.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that, as the crops removed from the soil all contain a\r\ngreater or less amount of inorganic matters, they must be continually\r\nundergoing diminution, and at length be completely exhausted unless\r\ntheir quantity is maintained from some external source. In many cases\r\nthe supply of these substances is so large that ages may elapse before\r\nthis becomes apparent, but where the quantity is small, a system of\r\nreckless cropping may reduce a soil to a state of absolute sterility. A\r\nremarkable illustration of this fact is found in the virgin soils of\r\nAmerica, from which the early settlers reaped almost unheard-of crops,\r\nbut, by injudicious cultivation, they were soon exhausted and abandoned,\r\nnew tracts being brought in and cultivated only to be in their turn\r\nabandoned. The knowledge of the composition of the ash of plants assists\r\nus in ascertaining how this exhaustion may be avoided, and indicates the\r\nmode in which such soils may be preserved in a fertile state.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Apparently a species of Sinapis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Oxide of Manganese, 0.42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Oxide of Manganese, 0.92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Alumina, 1.02.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Alumina, 0.63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Iodide of Potassium, 0.44; Sulphuret of Sodium, 3.66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Iodide of Potassium, 0.23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Iodide of Potassium, 1.68.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL--ITS CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo department of agricultural chemistry is surrounded with greater\r\ndifficulties and uncertainties than that relating to the properties of\r\nthe soil. When chemistry began to be applied to agriculture, it was not\r\nunnaturally supposed that the examination of the soil would enable us to\r\nascertain with certainty the mode in which it might be most\r\nadvantageously improved and cultivated, and when, as occasionally\r\nhappened, analysis revealed the absence of one or more of the essential\r\nconstituents of the plant in a barren soil, it indicated at once the\r\ncause and the cure of the defect. But the expectations naturally formed\r\nfrom the facts then observed have been as yet very partially fulfilled;\r\nfor, as our knowledge has advanced, it has become apparent that it is\r\nonly in rare instances that it is possible satisfactorily to connect\r\ntogether the composition and the properties of a soil, and with each\r\nadvancement in the accuracy and minuteness of our analysis the\r\ndifficulties have been rather increased than diminished. Although it is\r\noccasionally possible to predicate from its composition that a\r\nparticular soil will be incapable of supporting vegetation, it not\r\nunfrequently happens that a fruitful and a barren soil are so similar\r\nthat it is impossible to distinguish them from one another, and cases\r\neven occur in which the barren appears superior to the fertile soil. The\r\ncause of this apparently anomalous phenomenon lies in the fact that\r\nanalysis, however minute, is unable to disclose all the conditions of\r\nfertility, and that it must be supplemented by an examination of its\r\nphysical and other chemical properties, which are not indicated by\r\nordinary experiments. Of late years very considerable progress has been\r\nmade in the investigation of the properties of the soil, and many facts\r\nof great importance have been discovered, but we are still unable to\r\nassert that all the conditions of fertility are yet known, and the\r\npractical application of those recently discovered is still very\r\nimperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that a careful analysis of a soil is without\r\nvalue, for very important practical deductions may often be drawn from\r\nit, and when this is not practicable it is not unfrequently due to its\r\nbeing imperfect or incomplete, for it is so complex that the cases in\r\nwhich all the necessary details have been eliminated are even now by no\r\nmeans numerous. In fact, the want of a large number of thorough analyses\r\nof soils of different kinds is a matter of some difficulty, and so soon\r\nas a satisfactory mode of investigation can be determined upon, a full\r\nexamination of this subject would be of much importance.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Soils._--The constituents of the soil, like those of the\r\nplant, may be divided into the great classes of organic and inorganic.\r\nThe origin of the former has been already discussed: they are derived\r\nfrom the decay of plants which have already grown upon the soil, and\r\nwhich, in various stages of decomposition, form the numerous class of\r\nsubstances grouped together under the name of humus. The organic\r\nsubstances may therefore be considered as in a manner secondary\r\nconstituents of the soil, which have been accumulated in it as the\r\nconsequence of the growth and decay of successive generations of plants,\r\nwhile the primeval soil consisted of inorganic substances only.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic constituents of the soil are obtained as the result of a\r\nsuccession of chemical changes going on in the rocks which protrude\r\nthrough the surface of the earth. We have only to examine one of these\r\nrocks to observe that it is constantly undergoing a series of important\r\nchanges. Under the influence of air and moisture, aided by the powerful\r\nagency of frost, it is seen to become soft, and gradually to\r\ndisintegrate, until it is finally converted into an uniform powder, in\r\nwhich the structure of the original rock is with difficulty, if at all\r\ndistinguishable. The rapidity with which these changes take place is\r\nvery variable; in the harder rocks, such as granite and mica slate it is\r\nso slow as to be scarcely perceptible, while in others, such as the\r\nshales of the coal formation, a very few years' exposure is sufficient\r\nfor the purpose. These actions, operating through a long series of\r\nyears, are the source of the inorganic constituents of all soils.\r\n\r\nGeology points to a period at which the earth's surface must have been\r\naltogether devoid of soil, and have consisted entirely of hard\r\ncrystalline rocks, such as granite and trap, by the disintegration of\r\nwhich, slowly proceeding from the creation down to the present time, all\r\nthe soils which now cover the surface have been formed. But they have\r\nbeen produced by a succession of very complicated processes; for these\r\ndisintegrated rocks being washed away in the form of fine mud, or at\r\nleast of minute particles, and being deposited at the bottom of the\r\nprimeval seas, have there hardened into what are called sedimentary\r\nrocks, which being raised above the surface by volcanic action or other\r\ngreat geological forces, have been again disintegrated to yield\r\ndifferent soils. Thus, then, all soils are directly or indirectly\r\nderived from the crystalline rocks, those overlying them being formed\r\nimmediately by their decomposition, while those found above the\r\nsedimentary rocks may be traced back through them to the crystalline\r\nrocks from which they were originally formed.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, the composition of different soils must manifestly\r\ndepend on that of the crystalline rocks from which they have been\r\nderived. Their number is by no means large, and they all consist of\r\nmixtures in variable proportions of quartz, felspar, mica, hornblende,\r\naugite, and zeolites. With the exception of quartz and augite, these\r\nnames are, however, representatives of different classes of minerals.\r\nThere are, for instance, several different minerals commonly classified\r\nunder the name of felspar, which have been distinguished by\r\nmineralogists by the names of orthoclase, albite, oligoclase, and\r\nlabradorite; and there are at least two sorts of mica, two of\r\nhornblende, and many varieties of zeolites.\r\n\r\nQuartz consists of pure silica, and when in large masses is one of the\r\nmost indestructible rocks. It occurs, however, intermixed with other\r\nminerals in small crystals, or irregular fragments, and forms the entire\r\nmass of pure sand.\r\n\r\nThe four kinds of felspar which have been already named are compounds of\r\nsilica with alumina, and another base which is either potash, soda, or\r\nlime. Their composition is as follows, two examples of each being\r\ngiven--\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  |  Orthoclase. |    Albite.  | Oligoclase. | Labradorite. |\r\n------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\r\nSilica            |  65.72| 65.00| 67.99| 68.23| 62.70| 63.51| 54.66|  54.67|\r\nAlumina           |  18.57| 18.64| 19.61| 18.30| 23.80| 23.09| 27.87|  27.89|\r\nPeroxide of iron  | traces|  0.83|  0.70|  1.01|  0.62|   -- |  --  |   0.31|\r\nOxide of manganese| traces|  0.13|  --  |   -- |   -- |   -- |  --  |    -- |\r\nLime              |   0.34|  1.23|  0.66|  1.26|  4.60|  2.44| 12.01|  10.60|\r\nMagnesia          |   0.10|  1.03|  --  |  0.51|  0.02|  0.77|  --  |   0.18|\r\nPotash            |  14.02|  9.12|  --  |  2.53|  1.05|  2.19|  --  |   0.49|\r\nSoda              |   1.25|  3.49| 11.12|  7.99|  8.00|  9.37|  5.46|   5.05|\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n                  | 100.00| 99.47|100.08| 99.83|100.79|101.37|100.00| 99.19 |\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that soils produced by the disintegration of these\r\nminerals must differ materially in quality. Those yielded by orthoclase\r\nmust generally abound in potash, while albite and labradorite,\r\ncontaining little or none of that element, must produce soils in which\r\nit is deficient. The quality of the soil they yield is not however\r\nentirely dependent on the nature of the particular felspar which yields\r\nit, but is also intimately connected with the extent to which the\r\ndecomposition has advanced. It is observed that different felspars\r\nundergo decomposition with different degrees of rapidity but after a\r\ncertain time they all begin to lose their peculiar lustre, acquire a\r\ndull and earthy appearance, and at length fall into a more or less white\r\nand soft powder. During this change water is absorbed, and, by the\r\ndecomposing action of the air, the alkaline silicate is gradually\r\nrendered soluble, and at length entirely washed away, leaving a\r\nsubstance which, when mixed with water, becomes plastic, and has all the\r\ncharacters of common clay. The nature of this change will be best seen\r\nby the following analysis of the clay produced during this composition,\r\nwhich is employed in the manufacture of porcelain under the name of\r\nkaolin, or china clay--\r\n\r\n     Silica             46.80\r\n     Alumina            36.83\r\n     Peroxide of iron    3.11\r\n     Carbonate of lime   0.55\r\n     Potash              0.27\r\n     Water              12.44\r\n                         ----\r\n                       100.00\r\n\r\nIn this instance the decomposition of the felspar had reached its limit,\r\na mere trace of potash being left, but if taken at different stages of\r\nthe process, variable proportions of that alkali are met with. This\r\ndecomposition of felspar is the source of the great deposits of clay\r\nwhich are so abundantly distributed over the globe, and it takes place\r\nwith nearly equal rapidity with potash and soda felspar. It is rarely\r\ncomplete, and the soils produced from it frequently contain a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the undecomposed mineral, which continues for\r\na long period to yield a supply of alkalies to the plants which grow on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMica is a very widely distributed mineral, and two varieties of it are\r\ndistinguished by mineralogists, one of which is characterised by the\r\nlarge quantity of magnesia it contains. Different specimens are found to\r\nvary very greatly in composition, but the following analyses may\r\nrepresent their most usual composition:\r\n\r\n                                 MICA.\r\n                           |----------------|\r\n                           Potash.

Its persistence is dependent on the\r\nsmall quantity of alkaline constituents which it contains; and for this\r\nreason it is observed that the magnesian micas undergo decomposition\r\nless rapidly than those containing the larger quantity of potash.\r\nEventually, however, both varieties become converted into clay, their\r\nmagnesia and potash passing gradually into soluble forms.\r\n\r\nHornblende and augite are two widely distributed minerals, which are so\r\nsimilar in composition and properties that they may be considered\r\ntogether. Of the former two varieties, basaltic and common have been\r\ndistinguished, and their composition is given below:--\r\n\r\n                      Hornblende.\r\n                  |----------------|\r\n                  Common.

Of these the most important are the zeolites\r\nwhich do not occur in large masses but are disseminated through the\r\nother rocks in small quantity. They form a large class of minerals of\r\nwhich Thomsonite and natrolite may be selected as examples--\r\n\r\n        Thomsonite.  Natrolite.\r\n\r\nSilica     38.73       48.68\r\nAlumina    30.84       26.36\r\nLime       13.43         --\r\nPotash      0.54        0.23\r\nSoda        3.85       16.00\r\nWater      13.09        9.55\r\n            ----        ----\r\n          100.48      100.83\r\n\r\nThey are chiefly characterized by containing their silica in a soluble\r\nstate, and hence may yield that substance to the plants in a condition\r\nparticularly favourable for absorption.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from what has been stated that all these minerals are\r\ncapable, by their decomposition, of yielding soft porous masses having\r\nthe physical properties of soils, but most of them would be devoid of\r\nmany essential ingredients, while not one of them would yield either\r\nphosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, or chlorine. It has, however, been\r\nrecently ascertained that certain of these minerals, or at least the\r\nrocks formed from them, contain minute, but distinctly appreciable\r\ntraces of phosphoric acid, although in too small quantity to be detected\r\nby ordinary analysis; and small quantities of chlorine and sulphuric\r\nacid may also in most instances be found.\r\n\r\nStill it will be observed that most of these minerals would yield a soil\r\ncontaining only two or three of those substances, which, as we have\r\nalready learned, are essential to the plant. Thus, potash felspar, while\r\nit would give abundance of potash, would be but an inefficient source\r\nof lime and magnesia; and labradorite, which contains abundance of lime,\r\nis altogether deficient in magnesia and potash.\r\n\r\nNature has, however, provided against this difficulty, for she has so\r\narranged it that these minerals rarely occur alone, the rocks which form\r\nour great mountain masses being composed of intimate mixtures of two or\r\nmore of them, and that in such a manner that the deficiencies of the one\r\ncompensate those of the other. We shall shortly mention the composition\r\nof these rocks.\r\n\r\nGranite is a mixture of quartz, felspar, and mica in variable\r\nproportions, and the quality of the soil it yields depends on whether\r\nthe variety of felspar present be orthoclase or albite. When the former\r\nis the constituent, granite yields soils of tolerable fertility,\r\nprovided their climatic conditions be favourable; but it frequently\r\noccurs in high and exposed situations which are unfavourable to the\r\ngrowth of plants. Gneiss is a similar mixture, but characterised by the\r\npredominance of mica, and by its banded structure. Owing to the small\r\nquantity of felspar which it contains, and the abundance of the\r\ndifficulty decomposable mica, the soils formed by its disintegration are\r\ngenerally inferior. Mica slate is also a mixture of quartz, felspar, and\r\nmica, but consisting almost entirely of the latter ingredient, and\r\nconsequently presenting an extreme infertility. The position of the\r\ngranite, gneiss, and mica slate soils in this country is such that very\r\nfew of them are of much value; but in warm climates they not\r\nunfrequently produce abundant crops of grain. Syenite is a rock similar\r\nin composition to granite, but having the mica replaced by hornblende,\r\nwhich by its decomposition yields supplies of lime and magnesia more\r\nreadily than they can be obtained from the less easily disintegrated\r\nmica. For this reason soils produced from the syenitic rocks are\r\nfrequently possessed of considerable fertility.\r\n\r\nThe series of rocks of which greenstone and trap are types, and which\r\nare very widely distributed, differ greatly in composition from those\r\nalready mentioned. They are divisible into two great classes, which have\r\nreceived the names of diorite and dolerite, the former a mixture of\r\nalbite and hornblende, the latter of augite and labradorite, sometimes\r\nwith considerable quantities of a sort of oligoclase containing both\r\nsoda and lime, and of different kinds of zeolitic minerals. Generally\r\nspeaking, the soils produced from diorite are superior to those from\r\ndolerite. The albite which the former contains undergoes a rapid\r\ndecomposition, and yields abundance of soda along with some potash,\r\nwhich is seldom altogether wanting, while the hornblende supplies both\r\nlime and magnesia. Dolerite, when composed entirely of augite and\r\nlabradorite, produces rather inferior soils; but when it contains\r\noligoclase and zeolites, and comes under the head of basalt, its\r\ndisintegration is the source of soils remarkable for their fertility;\r\nfor these latter substances undergoing rapid decomposition furnish the\r\nplants with abundant supplies of alkalies and lime, while the more\r\nslowly decomposing hornblende affords the necessary quantity of\r\nmagnesia. In addition to these, the basaltic rocks are found to contain\r\nappreciable quantities of phosphoric acid, so that they are in a\r\ncondition to yield to the plant almost all its necessary constituents.\r\n\r\nThe different rocks now mentioned, with a few others of less general\r\ndistribution, constitute the whole of our great mountain masses; and\r\nwhile their general composition is such as has been stated, they\r\nfrequently contain disseminated through them quantities of other\r\nminerals which, though in trifling quantity, nevertheless add their\r\nquota of valuable constituents to the soils. Moreover, the exact\r\ncomposition of the minerals of which the great masses of rocks are\r\ncomposed is liable to some variety. Those which we have taken as\r\nillustrations have been selected as typical of the minerals; but it is\r\nnot uncommon to find albite containing 2 or 3 per cent of potash,\r\nlabradorite with a considerable proportion of soda, and zeolitic\r\nminerals containing several per cent of potash, the presence of which\r\nmust of course considerably modify the properties of the soils produced\r\nfrom them. They are also greatly affected by the mechanical influences\r\nto which the rocks are exposed; and being situated for the most part in\r\nelevated positions, they are no sooner disintegrated than they are\r\nwashed down by the rains. A granite, for instance, as the result of\r\ndisintegration, has its felspar reduced to an impalpable powder, while\r\nits quartz and mica remain, the former entirely, the latter in great\r\npart, in the crystalline grains which existed originally in the granite.\r\nIf such a disintegrated granite remains on the spot, it is easy to see\r\nwhat its composition must be; but if exposed to the action of running\r\nwater, by which it is washed away from its original site, a process of\r\nseparation takes place, the heavy grains of quartz are first deposited,\r\nthen the lighter mica, and lastly the felspar. Thus there may be\r\nproduced from the same granite, soils of very different nature and\r\ncomposition, from a pure and barren sand to a rich clay formed entirely\r\nof felspathic debris.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary or stratified rocks are formed of particles carried down\r\nby water and deposited at the bottom of the primeval seas from which\r\nthey have been upheaved in the course of geological changes. The\r\nprocess of their formation may be watched at the present day at the\r\nmouths of all great rivers, where a delta composed of the suspended\r\nmatters carried down by the waters is slowly formed. The nature of these\r\nrocks must therefore depend entirely on that of the country through\r\nwhich the river flows. If its course runs through a country in which\r\nlime is abundant, calcareous rocks will be deposited, and if it passes\r\nthrough districts of different geological characters the deposit must\r\nnecessarily consist of a mixture of the disintegrated particles of the\r\ndifferent rocks the river has encountered. For this reason it is\r\nimpossible to enter upon a detailed account of their composition. It is\r\nto be observed, however, that the particles of which they are composed,\r\nthough originally derived from the crystalline rocks, have generally\r\nundergone a complex series of changes, geology teaching that, after\r\ndeposition, they may in their turn undergo disintegration and be carried\r\naway by water, to be again deposited. Their composition must therefore\r\nvary not merely according to the nature of the rock from which they have\r\nbeen formed, but also according to the extent to which the decomposition\r\nhas gone, and the successive changes to which they have been exposed.\r\nThey may be reduced to the three great classes of clays, including the\r\ndifferent kinds of clay slates, shales, etc., sandstone and limestone.\r\nIt must be added also, that many of them contain carbonaceous matters\r\nproduced by the decomposition of early races of plants and animals, and\r\nthat mixtures of two or more of the different classes are frequent.\r\n\r\nThe purest clays are produced by the decomposition of felspar, but\r\nalmost all the crystalline rocks may produce them by the removal of\r\ntheir alkalies, iron, lime, etc. Where circumstances have been\r\nfavourable, the whole of these substances are removed, and the clay\r\nwhich remains consists almost entirely of silica and alumina, and yields\r\na soil which is almost barren, not merely on account of the deficiency\r\nof many of the necessary elements of plants, but because it is so stiff\r\nand impenetrable that the roots find their way into it with difficulty.\r\nIt rarely happens, however, that decomposition has advanced so far as to\r\nremove the whole of the alkalies, which is exemplified by the following\r\nanalyses of the fire clay of the coal formation, and of transition clay\r\nslate:--\r\n\r\n                  Transition   Fire Clay.\r\n                  Clay Slate.\r\n\r\nSilica              60.03        54.77\r\nAlumina             14.91        28.61\r\nPeroxide of iron     8.94         4.92\r\nLime                 2.08         0.58\r\nMagnesia             4.22         1.14\r\nPotash               3.87         1.00\r\nSoda                  --          0.24\r\nCarbonic acid }      5.67         8.24\r\nWater         }\r\n                     ----         ----\r\n                    99.72        99.50\r\n\r\nThe sandstones are derived from the siliceous particles of granite and\r\nother rocks, and consist in many cases of nearly pure silica, in which\r\ncase their disintegration produces a barren sand, but they more\r\nfrequently contain an admixture of clay and micaceous scales, which\r\nsometimes form a by no means inconsiderable portion of them. Such\r\nsandstones yield soils of better quality, but they are always light and\r\npoor. Where they occur interstratified with clays, still better soils\r\nare produced, the mutual admixture of the disintegrated rocks affording\r\na substance of intermediate properties, in which the heaviness of the\r\nclay is tempered by the lightness of the sandstone.\r\n\r\nLimestone is one of the most widely distributed of the stratified rocks,\r\nand in different localities occurs of very different composition.\r\nLimestones are divided into two classes, common and magnesian; the\r\nformer a nearly pure carbonate of lime, the latter a mixture of that\r\nsubstance with carbonate of magnesia. But while these are the principal\r\nconstituents, it is not uncommon to find small quantities of phosphate\r\nand sulphate of lime, which, however trifling their proportions, are not\r\nunimportant in an agricultural point of view. The following analyses\r\nwill serve to illustrate the general composition of these two sorts of\r\nlimestone as they occur in the early geological formations:--\r\n\r\n                          COMMON.

They are replaced in later geological periods by\r\nothers which are much softer, and often purer, of which the oolitic\r\nlimestones, so called from their resemblance to the roe of a fish, and\r\nchalk are the most important. Other limestones are also known which\r\ncontain an admixture of clay. The soils produced by the disintegration\r\nof limestone and chalk are generally light and porous, but when mixed\r\nwith clay, possess a very high degree of fertility, and this is\r\nparticularly the case with chalk, which yields some of the most valuable\r\nof all soils. But it is true only of the common limestones, for\r\nexperience has shown that those which contain magnesia in large quantity\r\nare often prejudicial to vegetation, and sometimes yield barren or\r\ninferior soils.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general characters of the three great classes of stratified\r\nrocks; any attempt to particularise the numerous varieties of each would\r\nlead us far beyond the limits of the present work. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, to remark, that in many instances one variety passes into the\r\nother, or, more correctly speaking, sedimentary rocks occur, which are\r\nmixtures of two or more of the three great classes. In fact, the name\r\ngiven to each really expresses only the preponderating ingredient, and\r\nmany sandstones contain much clay, shales and clay slates abound in\r\nlime, and limestones in sand or clay, so that it may sometimes be a\r\nmatter of some difficulty to decide to which class they belong. Such\r\nmixtures usually produce better soils than either of their constituents\r\nseparately, and accordingly, in those geological formations in which\r\nthey occur, the soils are generally of excellent quality. The same\r\neffect is produced where numerous thin beds of members of the different\r\nclasses are interstratified, the disintegrated portions being gradually\r\nintermixed, and valuable soils formed.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the soils formed from the stratified rocks is also\r\nincreased by the presence of organic remains which afford a supply of\r\nphosphoric acid, and which are sometimes so abundant as to form a by no\r\nmeans unimportant part of their mass. They do not occur in the oldest\r\nsedimentary rocks, but as we ascend to the more recent geological\r\nepochs, they increase in abundance, until, in the greensands and other\r\nrecent formations, whole beds of coprolites and other organic remains\r\nare met with. Great differences are observed in the quality of the soils\r\nyielded by different rocks. In general, those formed by the\r\ndisintegration of clay slates are cold, heavy, and very difficult and\r\nexpensive to work; those of sandstone light and poor, and of limestone\r\noften poor and thin. These statements must, however, be considered as\r\nvery general; for individual cases occur in which some of these\r\nsubstances may produce good soils, remarkable exceptions being offered\r\nby the lower chalk and some of the shales of the coal formation. Little\r\nis at present known regarding the peculiar nature of many of these\r\nrocks, or their composition; and the cause of the differences in the\r\nfertility of the soil produced from them is a subject worthy of minute\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of the Soil._--Reference has been already made to\r\nthe division of the constituents of the soil into the two great classes\r\nof organic and inorganic. And when treating of the sources of the\r\norganic constituents of plants, we entered with some degree of\r\nminuteness into the composition and relations of the different members\r\nof the former class, and expressed the opinion that they did not admit\r\nof being directly absorbed by the plant. But though the parts then\r\nstated lead to the inference that, as a direct source of these\r\nsubstances, humus is unimportant, it has other functions to perform\r\nwhich render it an essential constituent of all fertile soils. These\r\nfunctions are dependent partly on the power which it has of absorbing\r\nand entering into chemical composition with ammonia, and with certain of\r\nthe soluble inorganic substances, and partly on the effect which the\r\ncarbonic acid produced by its decomposition exerts on the mineral\r\nmatters of the soil. In the former way, its effects are strikingly seen\r\nin the manner in which ammonia is absorbed by peat; for it suffices\r\nmerely to pour upon some dried peat a small quantity of a dilute\r\nsolution of ammonia to find its smell immediately disappear. This\r\npeculiar absorptive power extends also to the fixed alkalies, potash and\r\nsoda, as well as to lime and magnesia, and has an important effect in\r\npreventing these substances being washed out of the soil--a property\r\nwhich, as we shall afterwards see, is possessed also by the clay\r\ncontained in greater or less quantity in most soils. On the other hand,\r\nthe air and moisture which penetrate the soil cause its decomposition,\r\nand the carbonic acid so produced attacks the undecomposed minerals\r\nexisting in it, and liberate the valuable substances they contain.\r\n\r\nIn considering the composition of a soil, it is important to bear in\r\nmind that it is a substance of great complexity, not merely because it\r\ncontains a large number of chemical elements, but also because it is\r\nmade up of a mixture of several minerals in a more or less decomposed\r\nstate. The most cursory examination shows that it almost invariably\r\ncontains sand and scales of mica, and other substances can often be\r\ndetected in it. Now it has been already observed that the minerals of\r\nwhich soils are composed, differ to a remarkable extent in the facility\r\nwith which they undergo decomposition, and the bearing of this fact on\r\nits fertility is a matter of the highest importance, for it has been\r\nfound that the mere presence of an abundant supply of all the essential\r\nconstituents of plants is not always sufficient to constitute a fertile\r\nsoil. Two soils, for instance, may be found on analysis to have exactly\r\nthe same composition, although in practice one proves barren and the\r\nother fertile. The cause of this difference lies in the particular\r\nstate of combination in which the elements are contained in them, and\r\nunless this be such that the plant is capable of absorbing them, it is\r\nimmaterial in what quantity they are present, for they are thus locked\r\nup from use, and condemn the soil to hopeless infertility.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that unless the substances be present in a state in which\r\nthey can be dissolved, the plant is incapable of absorbing them; but it\r\nis a matter of doubt whether it is necessary that they be actually\r\ndissolved in the water which permeates the soil, or whether the plant is\r\ncapable of exercising a directly solvent action. The latter view is the\r\nmost probable, but at the same time it cannot be doubted, that if they\r\nare presented to the plant in solution, they will be absorbed in that\r\nstate in preference to any other. Hence it has been considered important\r\nin the analysis of a soil, not to rest content with the determination of\r\nthe quantity of each element it contains, but to obtain some indication\r\nof the state of combination in which it exists, so as to have some idea\r\nof the ease or difficulty with which they may be absorbed. For this\r\npurpose it is necessary to determine, _1st_, The substances soluble in\r\nwater; _2d_, Those insoluble in water, but soluble in acids; _3d_, Those\r\ninsoluble both in water and acids; and if to these the organic\r\nconstituents be added, there are four separate heads under which the\r\ncomponents of a soil ought to be classified. This classification is\r\naccordingly adopted in the most careful and minute analyses; but the\r\ndifficulty and labour attending them has hitherto precluded the\r\npossibility of making them except in a few instances; and, generally\r\nspeaking, chemists have been contented with treating the soil with an\r\nacid, and determining in the solution all that is dissolved. Such\r\nanalyses are often useful for practical purposes, as for example, when\r\nthey show the absence of lime, or any other individual substance, by the\r\naddition of which we may rectify the deficiency of the soil; but they\r\nare of comparatively little scientific value, and throw but little light\r\non the true constitution of the soil, and the sources of its fertility.\r\nNor is it likely that much satisfactory information will be obtained\r\nuntil the number of minute analyses is so far extended as to establish\r\nthe fundamental principles on which the various properties of the soil\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the constituents of a soil into the four great groups\r\nalready mentioned, is effected in the following manner:--A given\r\nquantity of the soil is boiled with three or four successive quantities\r\nof water, which dissolves out all the soluble matters. These generally\r\namount to about one-half per cent of the whole soil, and consist of\r\nnearly equal proportions of organic and inorganic substances. In very\r\nlight and sandy soils, it occasionally happens that not more than one or\r\ntwo-tenths per cent dissolve in water, and in peaty soils, on the other\r\nhand, the proportion is sometimes considerably increased, principally\r\nowing to the abundance of soluble organic matters.\r\n\r\nWhen the residue of this operation is treated with dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid, the matters soluble in acids are obtained in the fluid. The\r\nproportion of these substances is liable to very great variations, and\r\nin some soils of excellent quality, and well adapted to the growth of\r\nwheat, it does not exceed 3 per cent; while in calcareous soils, such as\r\nthose of the chalk formation, it may reach as much as 50 or 60 per cent.\r\nIn general, however, it amounts to about 10 per cent. The organic\r\nconstituents are also very variable in amount; ordinary soils of good\r\nquality containing from 2 to 10 per cent, while in peat soils they not\r\nunfrequently reach 30 or even 50 per cent. But these cannot be\r\nconsidered _fertile_ soils. The insoluble constituents are likewise\r\nsubject to great variations, but, in the ordinary clay and sandy soils\r\nof this country, they generally form from 70 to 85 per cent of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the constituents under these different heads will be\r\nbest illustrated by a few analyses of soils of good quality, and for\r\nthis purpose we shall select two, noted for the excellent crops of wheat\r\nthey produce, and for their general fertility. The analyses were made\r\nfrom the upper 10 inches, and a quantity of the 10 inches immediately\r\nsubjacent was analysed as subsoil. The first is the ordinary wheat soil\r\nof the county of Mid-Lothian, the other the alluvial soil of the Carse\r\nof Gowrie in Perthshire, so celebrated for the abundance and luxuriance\r\nof the crops it produces.\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------\r\n|                      |    Mid-Lothian.   |

6.82\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn examining these analyses, it is particularly worthy of notice that by\r\nfar the larger proportion of the substances soluble in water consists of\r\norganic matter, lime, and sulphuric acid, the two last being in\r\ncombination as sulphate of lime, while some of those substances which\r\nare usually considered to be the most important mineral constituents of\r\nplants are present in very small quantity--potash, for instance, forming\r\nnot more than 1-25,000th of the whole soil, and phosphoric acid being\r\nentirely absent. On the other hand, this portion contains the whole of\r\nthe chlorine which exists in the soil, and this might be anticipated\r\nfrom the ready solubility in water of the compounds of that substance.\r\n\r\nThe portion soluble in acids consists of alumina and oxide of iron, both\r\nof which are comparatively unimportant to the plant, but very important,\r\nas we shall afterwards see, in relation to the physical properties of\r\nthe soil. The remainder of the substances soluble in acids, amounting to\r\nfrom 1 and 2 per cent, is composed of some of the most essential\r\nconstituents of plants. Lime, magnesia, potash, and soda, appear again\r\nin larger quantity than in the soluble part, and along with them we have\r\nthe phosphoric acid to the amount of from 0.2 to 0.4 per cent of the\r\nwhole soil, and sulphuric acid in much smaller quantity.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble matters differ remarkably in the two soils, that from the\r\nCarse of Gowrie being characterised by a large quantity of potash and\r\nsoda, indicating an important difference in the materials from which\r\nthey have been formed. In the Perthshire soil it is obvious that the\r\nfelspathic element has been abundant, and that its decomposition has\r\nbeen arrested at a time, when it still contained a large quantity of\r\nalkalies. And this difference is of great practical importance, because\r\nthose soils, which contain a large quantity of potash in their insoluble\r\nportion, have within them a source of permanent fertility, the alkali\r\nbeing gradually liberated by the decomposition which is constantly in\r\nprogress, owing to the air and moisture permeating the soil. As regards\r\nthe special distribution of the inorganic matters, it is to be observed\r\nthat some of them occur in each of the three heads under which they are\r\narranged, while others are confined to one or two. Silica and the\r\nalkalies occur generally, though not invariably, in all three. Chlorine\r\nis met with only in the part soluble in water, phosphoric acid only in\r\nthat soluble in acids, while sulphuric acid occurs in both the\r\nlast-named divisions.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the organic matters are insoluble both in water and\r\nacids. At least it is generally believed that any portion dissolved by\r\nstrong acids, in the course of analysis, has been entirely decomposed,\r\nand is in a completely different state from that in which it existed\r\nactually in the soil.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a calcareous soil, forming a striking contrast to those\r\ngiven above, we select one from the island of Antigua, from which very\r\nlarge crops of sugar-cane are obtained. The soil is of great depth, and\r\nanalyses of the subsoil at the depth of 18 inches and 5 feet are given.\r\nThese last analyses are not so minute as that of the soil itself, the\r\nsoluble matters not having been separately determined, but included in\r\nthat soluble in acids.\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n|                             | Surface | 18 inches | 5 feet |\r\n|                             | Soil.   | deep.     | deep.  |\r\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n| SOLUBLE IN WATER.           |         |           |        |\r\n|                             |         |           |        |\r\n| Lime                        |   0.07  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Magnesia                    |  trace  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Potash                      |   0.06  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Soda                        |   0.04  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Chlorine                    |   0.05  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Organic matter              |   0.15  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n|                             |   ----  |           |        |\r\n|                             |   0.37  |           |        |\r\n| SOLUBLE IN ACIDS.           |         |           |        |\r\n|                             |         |           |        |\r\n| Silica                      |   0.74  |     ...   |    ... |\r\n| Peroxide of iron            |   2.22  |    1.67   |   1.87 |\r\n| Protoxide of iron           |   0.77  |    9.05   |   3.10 |\r\n| Alumina                     |   1.90  |    2.52   |   4.21 |\r\n| Lime                        |  10.43  |    3.04   |  25.75 |\r\n| Magnesia                    |   0.20  |    0.54   |   0.51 |\r\n| Potash                      |   0.03  |    0.29   |   0.28 |\r\n| Soda                        |   0.02  |    0.11   |   0.16 |\r\n| Sulphuric acid              |  trace  |    0.02   |   0.13 |\r\n| Phosphoric acid             |   0.14  |   trace   |   0.04 |\r\n| Carbonic acid               |   7.38  |    0.82   |  20.23 |\r\n|                             |  -----  |   -----   |  ----- |\r\n|                             |  23.83  |   18.06   |  56.28 |\r\n|                             |         |           |        |\r\n| INSOLUBLE IN ACIDS.         |         |           |        |\r\n|                             |         |           |        |\r\n| Silica                      |  41.44  |   51.24   |  27.67 |\r\n| Protoxide of iron           |   3.24  |    0.26   |   1.40 |\r\n| Alumina                     |   9.00  |    1.50   |   1.00 |\r\n| Lime                        |   0.08  |    0.88   |  trace |\r\n| Magnesia                    |   0.80  |    0.54   |  trace |\r\n| Potash                      |    ...  |    0.74   |    ... |\r\n| Soda                        |    ...  |    0.25   |    ... |\r\n|                             |  -----  |   -----   |  ----- |\r\n|                             |  54.56  |   55.41   |  30.07 |\r\n| ORGANIC MATTERS.            |         |           |        |\r\n|                             |         |           |        |\r\n| Humine                      |   1.58 }|           |        |\r\n| Humic acid                  |   1.15 }|   12.05   |  7.49  |\r\n| Insoluble organic matters   |   7.66 }|           |        |\r\n| Water                       |  11.13  |   14.69   |  6.06  |\r\n|                             |  -----  |   -----   | -----  |\r\n|                             |  21.52  |   26.74   | 13.55  |\r\n|                             +---------+-----------+--------+\r\n| Sum of all the constituents | 100.28  |  100.21   | 99.90  |\r\n|                             |=========|===========|========|\r\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n\r\nIn this soil there is a general resemblance in the composition of the\r\nportion soluble in water to those of the wheat soils. But the part\r\nsoluble in acids is distinguished by the great abundance of carbonate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil contains also a large quantity of protoxide of iron, a\r\nsubstance frequently found in subsoils containing much organic matter,\r\nand to which the air has imperfect access. Under these circumstances\r\nperoxide of iron is reduced to protoxide; and when present abundantly in\r\nthe soil in that form, iron has been found to exercise a very injurious\r\ninfluence on vegetation; and it has frequently happened that when\r\nsubsoils containing it have been brought up to the surface, they have in\r\nthe first instance caused a manifest deterioration of the soil, although\r\nafter some time, when it had become peroxidised by the action of the\r\nair, it ceased to be injurious.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Holland, from the neighbourhood of the Zuider Zee, which is\r\nan alluvial deposit from the waters of the Rhine, and produces large\r\ncrops, gave the results which follow--\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n|                             | Surface. | 15 inches | 30 inches |\r\n|                             |          | deep.     | deep.     |\r\n+-----------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n| Insoluble silica            | 57.646   |  51.706   |   55.372  |\r\n| Soluble silica              |  2.340   |   2.496   |    2.286  |\r\n| Alumina                     |  1.830   |   2.900   |    2.888  |\r\n| Peroxide of iron            |  9.039   |  10.305   |   11.864  |\r\n| Protoxide of iron           |  0.350   |   0.563   |    0.200  |\r\n| Oxide of manganese          |  0.288   |   0.354   |    0.284  |\r\n| Lime                        |  4.092   |   5.096   |    2.480  |\r\n| Magnesia                    |  0.130   |   0.140   |    0.128  |\r\n| Potash                      |  1.026   |   1.430   |    1.521  |\r\n| Soda                        |  1.972   |   2.069   |    1.937  |\r\n| Ammonia                     |  0.060   |   0.078   |    0.075  |\r\n| Phosphoric acid             |  0.466   |   0.324   |    0.478  |\r\n| Sulphuric acid              |   0.896  |    1.104  |    0.576  |\r\n| Carbonic acid               |   6.085  |    6.940  |    4.775  |\r\n| Chlorine                    |   1.240  |    1.302  |    1.418  |\r\n| Humic acid                  |   2.798  |    3.991  |    3.428  |\r\n| Crenic acid                 |   0.771  |    0.731  |    0.037  |\r\n| Apocrenic acid              |   0.107  |    0.160  |    0.152  |\r\n| Other organic matters and } |          |           |           |\r\n|   Combined water          } |   8.324  |    7.700  |    9.348  |\r\n| Loss                        |   0.540  |    0.611  |    0.753  |\r\n|                             | -------  |  -------  |  -------  |\r\n|                             | 100.000  |  100.000  |  100.000  |\r\n|                             |==========|===========|===========|\r\n+-----------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to multiply analyses of fertile soils, those now given\r\nbeing sufficient to show their general composition. They are all\r\ncharacterised by the presence, in considerable quantity, of all the\r\nessential constituents of plants, in a state in which they may be\r\nreadily absorbed. The absence of one or more of these substances\r\nimmediately diminishes or altogether destroys the fertility of the soil;\r\nand the extent to which this occurs is illustrated by the following\r\nanalysis of a soil from Pumpherston, Mid-Lothian, forming a small patch\r\nin the lower part of a field, and on which nothing would grow. Being\r\nnaturally wet, it had been drained and sowed with oats, which died out\r\nabout six weeks after sowing, and left a bare soil on which weeds did\r\nnot show the slightest disposition to grow.\r\n\r\n        SOLUBLE IN ACIDS.\r\n\r\n     Soluble silica     0.173\r\n     Peroxide of iron   6.775\r\n     Alumina            1.150\r\n     Oxide of manganese  trace\r\n     Carbonate of lime   0.856\r\n     Magnesia            0.099\r\n     Potash              0.132\r\n     Soda                0.123\r\n     Phosphoric acid     trace\r\n     Chlorine            trace\r\n                         ----   9.308\r\n     Silica             73.096\r\n     Peroxide of iron    1.371\r\n     Alumina             4.263\r\n     Lime                0.858\r\n     Magnesia            0.520\r\n                         ----  80.108\r\n     Organic matter      8.012\r\n     Water               2.391\r\n                         ----  10.403\r\n                               ------\r\n                               99.819\r\n\r\nIn this instance the barrenness of the soil is distinctly traceable to\r\nthe deficiency of phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, and chlorine.

They must, however, be considered as in a great measure\r\nexceptional cases, as it is but rarely that so large a number of\r\nconstituents is absent, and it is much more frequent to find the\r\ndeficiency restricted to one or two substances. They are illustrations\r\nof barrenness dependent on different circumstances. The first shows the\r\nunimportance of the organic matters of the soil, which are here\r\nunusually abundant, without in any way counteracting the infertility\r\ndependent on the absence of the other constituents. The second is that\r\nof a nearly pure sand; and the third, though it contains a greater\r\nnumber of the essential ingredients of the ash, is still rendered\r\nunfruitful by the deficiency of alkalies, sulphuric acid, and chlorine.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the foregoing analyses indicates pretty clearly some\r\nof the conditions of fertility of the soil, which must obviously\r\ncontain all the constituents of the plants destined to grow upon it. But\r\nit by no means exhausts the subject, for numerous instances are known of\r\nsoils containing all the essential elements of plants in abundance, but\r\non which they nevertheless refuse to grow. In these instances the defect\r\nis due either to the presence of some substance injurious to the plant,\r\nor to the state of combination of those it requires being such as to\r\nprevent their absorption. Reference has been already made to the bad\r\neffects of protoxide of iron, and it would appear that organic matter is\r\nsometimes injurious. Even water, by excluding air, and so preventing\r\nthose decompositions which play so important a part in liberating the\r\nessential elements from their more permanent compounds, although it\r\ncannot render a soil absolutely barren, not unfrequently materially\r\ndiminishes its fertility.\r\n\r\nThe state of combination of the soil constituents unquestionably\r\nexercise a most important influence on its fertility. That this must be\r\nthe case is an inference which may be easily drawn from the statements\r\nalready made regarding the different minerals from which it is directly\r\nor indirectly produced. If, for instance, a soil consist to a large\r\nextent of mica, it would be found on analysis to contain abundance of\r\npotash and some other matters, and yet our knowledge of the difficulty\r\nwith which that mineral is decomposed, would enable us to pronounce\r\nunfavourably of the soil; and practical experience here fully confirms\r\nthe scientific inference.\r\n\r\nThe forms of combination most favourable to fertility is a subject on\r\nwhich our information is at present comparatively limited. It was at one\r\ntime believed that solubility in water was an indispensable requisite,\r\nbut recent investigations appear to lead to a directly contrary\r\nconclusion. The analyses of soils already given, show that the part\r\ndirectly soluble in water embraces only a certain number of the\r\nconstituents of the plant, and of those dissolved the quantity is very\r\nsmall. This becomes still more apparent if we estimate from the analyses\r\nthe actual quantities of those substances contained in an acre of soil.\r\nIt is generally assumed that the soil on an imperial acre of land 10\r\ninches deep weighs in round numbers about 1000 tons; and calculating\r\nfrom this, we find that the quantity of potash soluble in water in the\r\nMid-Lothian wheat soil, amounts to no more than 70 lb. per acre. But a\r\ncrop of hay carries off from the soil about 38 lb. of potash, and one of\r\nturnips, including tops, not less than 200 lb., so that if only the\r\nmatters soluble in water could be taken up by the plant, such soils\r\ncould not possess the amount of fertility which they are actually found\r\nto have.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, also, that in these analyses the experiment is\r\nmade under the most favourable circumstances for ascertaining the whole\r\nquantity of matters which are capable of dissolving in water; that\r\npractically dissolved is very different. The recent analysis by Krocker\r\nand Way of the drainage water of soils afford a means of estimating\r\nthis.

The average rainfall in Kent, where the waters he examined were\r\nobtained, is 25 inches. Now, it appears that about two-fifths of all the\r\nrain which falls escapes through the drains, and the rest is got rid of\r\nby evaporation. An inch of rain falling on an imperial acre weighs\r\nrather more than a hundred tons; hence, in the course of a year, there\r\nmust pass off by the drains about 1000 tons of drainage water, carrying\r\nwith it, out of the reach of the plants, such substances as it has\r\ndissolved, and 1500 tons must remain to give to the plant all that it\r\nholds in solution. These 1500 tons of water must, if they have the same\r\ncomposition as that which escapes, contain only two and a half pounds of\r\npotash, and less than a pound of ammonia. It may be alleged that the\r\nwater which remains, lying longer in contact with the soil, may contain\r\na larger quantity of matters in solution; but even admitting this to be\r\nthe case, it cannot for a moment be supposed that they can ever amount\r\nto more than a very small fraction of what is required for a single\r\ncrop. It may therefore be stated with certainty that solubility in water\r\nis not essential to the absorption of substances by the plant, which\r\nmust possess the power of itself directly attacking, acting chemically\r\non, and dissolving them. The mode in which it does this is entirely\r\nunknown, but it in all probability depends on very feeble chemical\r\nactions, and hence the importance of having the soil constituents, not\r\nin solution, but in such a state that they may be readily made soluble\r\nby the plants. Many of the minerals from which fertile soils are formed\r\nare probably not attackable by plants when in their natural condition,\r\nand even after disintegration the quantity of the essential elements of\r\ntheir food, which are present in an easily assimilable state, is at no\r\none time very large. But this is of comparatively little importance, for\r\nthe soil is not an inert unchangeable substance; it is the theatre of an\r\nimportant series of chemical changes effected by the action of air and\r\nmoisture, and producing a continued liberation of its constituents. This\r\ndecomposition is effected partly by the carbonic acid of the atmosphere,\r\nbut to a much larger extent by its oxygen acting upon the organic\r\nmatters of the soil, and causing a constant though slow evolution of\r\nthat acid, which in its turn attacks the mineral matters. Boussingault\r\nand Levy have illustrated the extent of this action by examining the\r\ncomposition of the air contained in the pores of different soils, and\r\nhave obtained the following results:--\r\n\r\n+--------------------+------------+---------------+---------------------------+\r\n| Nature of          | Crop.      | No. of cubic  |100 VOLUMES OF AIR CONTAIN |\r\n|       Soil.        |            | inches of air +--------+--------+---------+\r\n|                    |            | in 34 cubic   |Carbonic| Oxygen.|Nitrogen.|\r\n|                    |            | inches of soil| acid.  |        |         |\r\n+--------------------+------------+---------------+--------+--------+---------+\r\n|Light sandy soil,   |            |               |        |        |         |\r\n|   newly manured    |   ...      |   8.0         |  2.17  |    ... |    ...  |\r\n|  Do. manured       |            |               |        |        |         |\r\n|    8 days before   |   ...      |   ...         |  1.54  |   18.80|  79.66  |\r\n|  Do. long          |Yellow      |               |        |        |         |\r\n|    after manuring  |  turnip    |   7.9         |  0.93  |   19.50|  79.57  |\r\n|Very sandy          |Vineyard    |   9.6         |  1.06  |   19.72|  79.22  |\r\n|Sandy, with many    |            |               |        |        |         |\r\n|  stones            |Forest      |   4.0         |  0.87  |   19.61|  79.52  |\r\n|Loamy               |   ...      |   2.4         |  0.46  |    ... |    ...  |\r\n|Sandy, subsoil      |            |               |        |        |         |\r\n|  of the last       |   ...      |   3.0         |  0.24  |    ... |    ...  |\r\n|Sandy soil, long    |            |               |        |        |         |\r\n|  after manuring    |Trefoil     |   7.6         |  0.74  |   19.02|  80.24  |\r\n|  Do.

This carbonic acid, which is obviously produced by the\r\ndecomposition of the vegetable matters and manure, acting partly as gas\r\nand partly dissolved in the soil water, exerts a solvent action on its\r\nconstituents. And, though a very feeble acid, its continuous action\r\nproduces in the course of time a large effect; while, during the\r\ninterval, the constituents of the soil are safely stored up, and\r\nliberated only as the plant requires them, by which bountiful provision\r\nof nature they are exposed to fewer risks of loss than if they had been\r\nall along in a state in which they could be absorbed. Carbonic acid not\r\nonly assists in effecting the decomposition of the minerals of the soil,\r\nbut its aqueous solution acts as a solvent of many substances, which\r\nare quite insoluble in pure water. It is in this way that much of the\r\nlime contained in natural waters is held in solution, and it has been\r\nascertained that magnesia, iron, and even phosphate of lime, may also be\r\ndissolved by it. It is probable that when these substances are\r\ndissolved, the plants will take them from solution in place of\r\nthemselves attacking the insoluble matters; but of the extent to which\r\nthis may occur nothing is yet known--the action of solvents on the soil\r\nbeing a subject which is as yet scarcely examined.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is, however, a most important agent in producing the\r\nchemical changes in the soil, and the particular value of humus lies in\r\nits affording a supply of that substance exactly when it is wanted; but\r\nthe carbonic acid of the atmosphere also takes part in these changes,\r\nalthough with different degrees of rapidity according to the character\r\nof the soil, acting rapidly in light, and slowly in stiff, clay soils.\r\nThe solvent action of the carbonic acid is, no doubt, principally\r\nexerted on the substances soluble in acids, but not entirely, for it is\r\nknown that the insoluble part is gradually being disintegrated and made\r\nsoluble; and hence it is that the composition of that part of the soil\r\nwhich resists the action of acids, and which at first sight might appear\r\nof no moment, is really important. It is obvious that this circumstance\r\nmust at once confer on the soil of the Carse of Gowrie a great\r\nsuperiority over those of Mid-Lothian and most other districts; for it\r\ncontains in its insoluble part a quantity of alkalies which must\r\nnecessarily form a source of continued fertility. Accordingly,\r\nexperience has all along shown the great superiority of that soil, and\r\nof alluvial soils generally, which are all more or less similar to it.\r\nThe facility with which these matters are attackable by carbonic acid is\r\nalso an important element of the fertility of a soil, and it is to the\r\nexistence of compounds which are readily decomposed by it that we\r\nattribute the high fertility of the trap soils.\r\n\r\nBy a further examination of the analyses of fertile soils, it is at once\r\napparent that the most essential constituents of plants are by no means\r\nvery abundant in them. In fact, phosphoric and sulphuric acids, lime,\r\nmagnesia, and the alkalies, which in most instances make up nine-tenths\r\nof the ash of plants, form but a small portion of even the most fertile\r\nsoils; while silica, which, except in the grasses, occurs in small\r\nquantity, oxide of iron which is a limited, and alumina a rare,\r\nconstituent of the ash, constitute by far their larger part. Thus the\r\ntotal amount of potash, soda, lime, magnesia, phosphoric and sulphuric\r\nacids and chlorine, contained in the Mid-Lothian wheat soil amounts only\r\nto 3.5888 per cent, and in the Perthshire to 6.4385, the entire\r\nremainder being substances which enter into the plant for the most part\r\nin much smaller quantity. And, as these small quantities of the more\r\nimportant substances are capable of supplying the wants of the plant, it\r\nmust be obvious that a very small fraction of the silica, oxide of iron,\r\nand alumina, which the soils contain, would afford to it the whole\r\nquantity of these substances it requires, and that the remainder must\r\nhave some other functions to perform.\r\n\r\nThe soil must be considered not merely as the source of the inorganic\r\nfood of plants, for it has to act also as a support for them while\r\ngrowing, and to retain a sufficient quantity of moisture to support\r\ntheir life; and unless it possess the properties which fit it for this\r\npurpose, it may contain all the elements of the food of plants, and yet\r\nbe nearly or altogether barren.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of the soil to this function is dependent to a great\r\nextent on its mechanical texture, and on this considerable light is\r\nfrequently thrown by a kind of mechanical analysis.\r\n\r\nIf a soil be shaken up with water and allowed to stand for a few\r\nminutes, it rapidly deposits a quantity of grains which are at once\r\nrecognised as common sand; and if the water be then poured off into\r\nanother vessel and allowed to stand for a longer time, a fine soft\r\npowder, having the properties and composition of common clay, is\r\ndeposited, while the clear fluid retains the soluble matters. By a more\r\ncareful treatment it is possible to distinguish and separate humus, and\r\nin soils lying on chalk or limestone, calcareous matter or carbonate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nIn this way the components can be classified into four groups, a mixture\r\nof two or more of which in variable proportions is found in all soils.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportions in which these substances exist in soils are,\r\nas we shall afterwards see, the foundation of their classification into\r\nthe light, heavy, calcareous, and other sub-divisions. But they are also\r\nintimately connected with certain chemical and mechanical peculiarities\r\nwhich have an important bearing on its fertility. It is a familiar fact,\r\nthat particular soils are specially adapted to the growth of certain\r\ncrops; and we talk of a wheat or a turnip soil as readily\r\ndistinguishable. It is to be observed, however, that in many such\r\ninstances the mere analysis may show no difference, or, at least, none\r\nsufficient to account for the peculiarity. A remarkable illustration is\r\noffered by the following analyses of two soils, on one of which red\r\nclover grows luxuriantly, while on the other it invariably fails.\r\n\r\n                           Clover fails.

The hard indestructible siliceous grains, of which\r\nsand is composed, form a soil of an open texture, through which water\r\nreadily permeates; while clay, from its fine state of division, and\r\npeculiar adhesiveness or plasticity, gives it a close-textured and\r\nretentive character, and their proper intermixture produces a light\r\nfertile loam, each tempering the peculiar properties of the other.\r\nIndeed, their mixture is manifestly essential, for sand alone contains\r\nlittle or none of the essential ingredients of plants; and if present in\r\nlarge quantity, the openness of the soil is excessive, water flows\r\nthrough it with rapidity, manures are rapidly wasted, and on the\r\naccession of drought, the plants growing upon it soon languish and die.\r\nClay, on the other hand, is by itself equally objectionable; the\r\ncloseness of its texture prevents the spreading of the roots of plants,\r\nand the access of carbonic acid, which, as we have already seen, is so\r\nimportant an agent in the changes occurring in the soil. In fact, a pure\r\nclay, that is to say, a clay unmixed with sand, even though it may\r\ncontain all the essential constituents of the plant, is for this reason\r\nunfertile. Practically, of course, these extreme cases rarely occur; the\r\nheaviest clay soils being mixtures of true clay with sand, and the most\r\nsandy containing their proportion of clay; but frequently the\r\npreponderance of the one over the other is so great, as to produce soils\r\ngreatly inferior to those in which the mixture is more uniform.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how the proportions in which sand and clay are\r\nmixed must affect the suitability of soils to particular crops, and that\r\nan open soil must be favourable to the turnip, and a heavy clay, owing\r\nto the resistance it offers to the expansion of the bulbs, unfavourable.\r\nBut these substances also exercise an important chemical action on the\r\nsoluble constituents of the food of plants, combining with them, and\r\nconverting them into an insoluble, or nearly insoluble state, so as to\r\nprevent their being washed away by the rain or other water which\r\npercolates through the soil. It has long been known to chemists that\r\nclay has a tendency to absorb a small proportion of ammonia, and even\r\nwhen brought up from a great depth frequently contains that substance.\r\nIt is to Mr. Thompson of Moat Hall, however, that we owe the important\r\nobservation, that arable soils rapidly remove ammonia from solution, and\r\nWay, who pursued this investigation, showed that not only ammonia, but\r\npotash, and several of the other important elements of the food of\r\nplants, are thus absorbed. The removal of these substances from solution\r\nis easily illustrated by a simple experiment. It suffices to take a tall\r\ncylindrical vessel open at both ends, and filled with the soil to be\r\noperated upon, which is retained by a piece of rag tied over its lower\r\nend. A quantity of a dilute solution of ammonia being then poured upon\r\nthe surface of the soil, and allowed to percolate, the first quantity\r\nwhich flows away is found to have entirely lost its peculiar smell and\r\ntaste; and in a similar manner the removal of potash may be illustrated.\r\nThis action is by no means confined to those substances when in the free\r\nstate, but is equally marked when they are combined with acids in the\r\nform of salts, and in the latter case the absorption is attended with a\r\ntrue chemical decomposition, the base only being retained, and the acid\r\nescaping most commonly in combination with lime. Thus, if sulphate of\r\nammonia be employed, the water which flows from the soil contains\r\nsulphate of lime, and if muriate of ammonia be used, it is muriate of\r\nlime which escapes.\r\n\r\nThis absorbent action is most remarkably manifested in the case of\r\nammonia and potash, but it takes place also with magnesia and soda. With\r\nthe latter, however, it is incomplete, only a half or a fourth of the\r\nsoda being removed from solution, the difference depending to some\r\nextent on the acid with which it is in combination. The extent to which\r\nabsorption takes place varies also with the nature of the soil, and the\r\nstate of combination of the substance used. Exact experiments have\r\nhitherto been chiefly confined to ammonia, potash, and lime in the free\r\nstate, and as bicarbonate; and the following table gives the results\r\nobtained by Way, with solutions containing about 1 per cent of these\r\nsubstances in solution:--\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|                       |     Loamy  |  Red soil,|   Pure   | Subsoil       |\r\n|                       |     soil,  | Berkshire.|    clay. |   clay,       |\r\n|                       |Dorsetshire.|           |          | Somersetshire.|\r\n------------------------|------------------------|----------|---------------|\r\n|Ammonia, caustic       |     0.3438 |   0.1570  |     ...  |   ...         |\r\n|   \"     from muriate  |     0.3478 |   0.1966  |    0.2847|  0.0818       |\r\n|Potash, caustic        |       ...  |     ...   |    1.050 |  2.087        |\r\n|  \"     from nitrate   |       ...  |     ...   |    0.4980|    ...        |\r\n|Lime, caustic          |       ...  |     ...   |    1.468 |    ...        |\r\n|  \"   from bicarbonate |       ...  |     ...   |    0.731 |    ...        |\r\n------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|---------------\r\n\r\nFrom these numbers it appears that very great differences exist in the\r\nabsorbent power of different soils, the first of those experimented on\r\nbeing capable of taking more than twice as much ammonia as the second,\r\nand nearly four times as much as the subsoil clay. It appears also, as\r\nfar as absorption goes, to be immaterial whether the ammonia is free or\r\ncombined. But it is different with potash, which is absorbed from the\r\nnitrate to the extent of about O.6 per cent, and from a caustic solution\r\nof potash to double that amount.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which absorption takes place modify, in a manner\r\nwhich cannot well be explained, the amount absorbed by the same soil. It\r\nis found generally to be most complete with very dilute solutions, and\r\nif a soil be agitated with a quantity of ammonia larger than it can\r\ntake up, it will absorb only a certain amount of that substance, but by\r\na further increase of the amount of ammonia a still larger quantity will\r\nbe absorbed.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that when a salt is used, the base only is\r\nabsorbed, and the acid escapes in combination with lime; even nitric\r\nacid, notwithstanding its importance as a food of plants, being in this\r\npredicament. From this it may be gathered that lime is not readily\r\nabsorbed from solutions of its salts; indeed, it would appear that the\r\nonly salt of that substance liable to absorption is the bicarbonate,\r\nfrom which it is taken to the extent of 1.4 per cent by the soil. The\r\nabsorption of lime from this salt, and that of phosphoric acid, which\r\ntakes place to a considerable extent, probably occurs, however, quite\r\nindependently of the clay present in the soil, and is occasioned by its\r\n_lime_, which forms an insoluble compound with phosphoric acid, and by\r\nremoving half the carbonic acid of the bicarbonate of lime converts it\r\nalso into an insoluble state.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these mineral substances, organic matters are also\r\nremoved from solution. This is conspicuously seen in the case of putrid\r\nurine, which not only loses its ammonia, but also its smell and colour,\r\nwhen allowed to percolate through soil; and an equally marked result was\r\nobtained with flax water, from which the organic matter was entirely\r\nabstracted.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this absorptive power is still very imperfectly known. Mr.\r\nWay having observed that sand has no such property, while clay, even\r\nwhen obtained from a considerable depth, always possesses it, supposed\r\nthat the absorption was entirely due to that substance. A difficulty,\r\nhowever, presents itself in explaining how it should happen that while a\r\npure clay absorbs only 0.2847 of ammonia, a loamy soil, of which\r\none-half probably is sand, should absorb a larger quantity. The\r\ninference is, that the effect cannot be due to the clay as a whole, and\r\nMr. Way has sought to explain it by supposing that there exist in the\r\nsoil particular double silicates of alumina and lime. He has shown that\r\nfelspar and the other minerals from which the soil is produced have no\r\nabsorbent power, but that artificial compounds can be formed which act\r\nupon solutions of ammonia and potash in a manner very similar to the\r\nsoil; but there is not the slightest evidence that these compounds exist\r\nin the soil, and in the year 1853[I] I pointed out the probability that\r\nclay is not the only agent at work, but that the organic matters take\r\npart in the process. So powerful indeed is the affinity of these\r\nsubstances for ammonia, that chemists are at one as to the difficulty of\r\nobtaining humic and other similar acids pure, owing to the obstinacy\r\nwith which they retain it; and there cannot be a doubt that in many\r\nsoils these substances are in this point of view of much importance.\r\nThis is particularly the case in peat soils, which, though naturally\r\nbarren, may be made to produce good crops by the application of sand or\r\ngravel; and as neither of these can cause any absorption of the valuable\r\nmatters, we must attribute this effect to the organic matter. Referring\r\nto an earlier series of experiments made in 1850, I showed that, if a\r\nquantity of dry peat be taken and ammonia poured on it, its smell\r\ndisappears; and this may be continued until upwards of 1.5 per cent of\r\ndry ammonia has been absorbed, and this quantity is _retained_ by the\r\npeat.\r\n\r\nIn this case pure ammonia was used, but Way's experiments having shown\r\nthat this alkali is not absorbed from its salts by organic matters, I\r\nexpressed the opinion that humate of lime (which certainly exists in\r\nmost soils) ought on chemical grounds to decompose the salts of ammonia\r\nand cause the retention of their base. The recent researches of\r\nBrustlein have shown that lime does cause the organic matters to absorb\r\nammonia from its salts. He confirms the fact that pure ammonia is\r\nabsorbed by peat, and shows that decayed wood has the same effect,\r\nalthough both are without action on solutions of its salts. A stiff\r\nclay, on the other hand, containing organic matters and much carbonate\r\nof lime, readily absorbed ammonia, both when pure and combined; but\r\nafter extracting the lime by means of a dilute acid, it lost the power\r\nof taking it from its salts, although it retained the free alkali as\r\ncompletely as before. On the addition of a small quantity of lime, it\r\nagain acquired the power of withdrawing ammonia from its compounds.\r\nThese experiments may be explained, either on the supposition of the\r\npresence of humate of lime, or by supposing that the carbonate of lime\r\nfirst decomposed the salts of ammonia, and that the liberated alkali\r\ncombined with the organic matter. It must be admitted, however, that it\r\nis very doubtful whether the ammonia and other substances are fixed in\r\nthe soil by a true chemical combination. They are certainly retained by\r\na very feeble attraction, for it appears from Brustlein's experiments\r\nthat ammonia may be, to a considerable extent, removed by washing with\r\nabundance of water, and that if the soil which has absorbed ammonia be\r\nallowed to become dry in the air, it loses half its ammonia, and after\r\nfour times moistening and drying, three-fourths have disappeared. These\r\nfacts are certainly not incompatible with the presence of a true\r\nchemical compound, for the humate of ammonia is not absolutely\r\ninsoluble, and many cases occur of actions taking place in the presence\r\nof water, which are entirely reversed when that fluid is removed; and it\r\nis quite possible that when humate of ammonia is dried in contact with\r\ncarbonate of lime, it may be decomposed, and carbonate of ammonia\r\nescape. There are other circumstances, however, which render it, on the\r\nwhole, most probable that the combination is not wholly chemical, but\r\nrather of a physical character, among which may be more especially\r\nmentioned the fact, that the quantity of the substances retained by the\r\nsoil is dependent on the degree of dilution of the fluid from which they\r\nare taken; and that the quantity absorbed never exceeds a very small\r\nfraction of the weight of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe practical inferences to be drawn from these facts regarding the\r\nvalue of soils are of the highest importance. It is obvious that two\r\nsoils having exactly the same chemical composition may differ widely in\r\nabsorptive power, and that which possesses it most largely must have the\r\nhighest agricultural value. The examination of different soils, in this\r\npoint of view, is a subject of much importance, and deserves the best\r\nattention of both farmers and chemists, although little has as yet been\r\ndone in regard to it, and the results which have been obtained are not\r\nof a very satisfactory character. Liebig states, that in his\r\nexperiments, all the arable soils examined possessed the same absorptive\r\npower, whether they contained a large or a small proportion of lime or\r\nalumina. It can scarcely be expected, however, that this should be true\r\nin all cases, and there are many facts which seem to indicate that\r\ndifferences must exist. It is well known that there are some soils in\r\nwhich the manure is very rapidly exhausted, and it is more than probable\r\nthat this effect is due to deficient absorptive power, which leaves the\r\nsoluble matters at the mercy of the weather, and liable at any moment\r\nto be washed out by a heavy fall of rain.\r\n\r\nThe more strictly mechanical properties of the soil, such as its\r\nrelations to heat and moisture, are not less important than its chemical\r\ncomposition. It is known that soils differ so greatly in these respects\r\nas sometimes materially to affect their productive capacity. Thus, for\r\ninstance, two soils may be identical in composition, but one may be\r\nhighly hygrometric, that is, may absorb moisture readily from the air,\r\nwhile the other may be very deficient in that property. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances no difference will be apparent in their produce, but in a\r\ndry season the crop upon the former may be in a flourishing condition,\r\nwhile that on the latter is languishing and enfeebled, merely from its\r\ninability to absorb from the air, and supply to the plant the quantity\r\nof water required for its growth. In the same way, a soil which absorbs\r\nmuch heat from the sun's rays surpasses another which has not that\r\nproperty; and though in many cases this effect is comparatively\r\nunimportant, in others it may make the difference between successful and\r\nunsuccessful cultivation in soils which lie in an unfavourable climate\r\nor exposure.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the physical characters of soils has attracted\r\nlittle attention, and we owe all our present knowledge of the subject to\r\na very elaborate series of researches on this subject, published by\r\nSchuebler, nearly thirty years ago. He determined _1st_, The specific\r\ngravity of the soils; _2d_, The quantity of water which they are capable\r\nof imbibing; _3d_, The rapidity with which they give off by evaporation\r\nthe water they have imbibed; that is, their tendency to become dry;\r\n_4th_, The extent to which they shrink in drying; _5th_, Their\r\nhygrometric power; _6th_, The extent to which they are heated by the\r\nsun's rays; _7th_, The rapidity with which a heated soil cools down,\r\nwhich indicates its power of _retaining_ heat; _8th_, Their tenacity, or\r\nthe resistance they offer to the passage of agricultural implements;\r\n_9th_, Their power of absorbing oxygen from the air. Each of these\r\nexperiments was performed on several different soils, and on their\r\nmechanical constituents. Schuebler's experiments are undoubtedly\r\nimportant, and though the methods employed are some of them not\r\naltogether beyond cavil, they have apparently been performed with great\r\ncare. It is nevertheless desirable that they should be repeated, for\r\nsuch facts ought not to rest on the authority of one experimenter,\r\nhowever skilful and conscientious, nor on a single series of soils,\r\nwhich may not give a fair representation of their general physical\r\nproperties. In fact, Schuebler appears to imagine that having once\r\ndetermined the extent to which the sand, clay, and other mechanical\r\nconstituents of the soil possess these properties, we are in a condition\r\nto predicate the effect of their mixture in variable proportions,\r\nalthough this is by no means probable.\r\n\r\nIn examining these properties, Schuebler selected for experiment, pure\r\nsiliceous sand, calcareous sand (carbonate of lime in coarse grains),\r\nfinely powdered carbonate of lime, pure clay, humus, and powdered\r\ngypsum. He used also a heavy clay consisting of 11 per cent of sand and\r\n89 of pure clay, a somewhat stiff clay containing 24 per cent of sand\r\nand 76 of clay, a light clay with 40 per cent of sand and 60 of pure\r\nclay, a garden soil consisting of 52.4 per cent of clay, 36.5 of\r\nsiliceous sand, 1.8 of calcareous sand, 2 per cent of finely divided\r\ncarbonate of lime, and 7.2 of humus, and two arable soils, one from\r\nHoffwyl, and one from a valley in the Jura, the former a somewhat stiff,\r\nthe latter a light soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n+-------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n|                   |          |           | Of 100    |            |\r\n|                   |          |

experiments detailed in the preceding table speak in a great measure\r\nfor themselves, and scarcely require detailed comment. It may be\r\nremarked, however, that the columns illustrating the relations of the\r\nsoil to water are probably more important than the others. The\r\nsuperiority of a retentive over an open soil is sufficiently familiar in\r\npractice, and though this is no doubt partly due to the former absorbing\r\nand retaining more completely the ammonia and other valuable\r\nconstituents of the manures applied to it, it is also dependent to an\r\nequal if not greater extent upon the power it possesses of retaining\r\nmoisture. A reference to the table makes it apparent that this power is\r\npresented under three different heads, which are certainly related to\r\none another, but are not identical. In the second column of the table is\r\ngiven the quantity of water absorbed by the soil, determined by placing\r\na given weight of the perfectly dry soil in a funnel, the neck of which\r\nis partially stopped with a small piece of sponge or wool, pouring water\r\nupon it, and weighing it after the water has ceased to drop from it.\r\nThis may be considered as representing the quantity of water retained by\r\nthese different soils when thoroughly saturated by long continued rains.\r\nThe column immediately succeeding gives the quantity of that water which\r\nescapes by evaporation from the same soil after exposure for four hours\r\nto dry air at the temperature of 66 deg.. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and\r\neighth columns indicate the quantity of moisture absorbed, when the\r\nsoil, previously artificially dried, is exposed to moist air for\r\ndifferent periods. These characters are dependent principally, though\r\nnot entirely, on the porosity of the soil. The last may also be in some\r\nmeasure due to the presence of particular salts, such as common salt,\r\nwhich has a great affinity for moisture, but is chiefly occasioned by\r\ntheir peculiar structure. It is to be remarked that clay and humus are\r\ntwo of the most highly hygrometric substances known, and it is\r\npeculiarly interesting to observe, that by a beneficent provision of\r\nnature, they also form a principal part of all fertile soils. The\r\nquantity of water imbibed by the soil is important to its fertility, in\r\nso far as it prevents it becoming rapidly dry after having been\r\nmoistened by the rains. It is valuable also in another point of view,\r\nbecause if the soil be incapable of absorbing much water, it becomes\r\nsaturated by a moderate fall of rain, and when a larger quantity falls,\r\nthe excess of necessity percolates through the soil, and carries off\r\nwith it a certain quantity of the soluble salts. Important as this\r\nproperty is, however, it must not be possessed in too high a degree, but\r\nmust permit the _evaporation_ of the water retained with a certain\r\ndegree of rapidity. Soils which do not admit of this taking place are\r\nthe cause of much inconvenience and injury in practice. By becoming\r\nthoroughly saturated with moisture during winter, they remain for a long\r\ntime in a wet and unworkable condition, in consequence of which they\r\ncannot be prepared and sown until late in the season, and though\r\nchemically unexceptionable, they are always disadvantageous, and in some\r\nseasons greatly disappoint the hopes of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the imbibition and evaporation of water takes place\r\nis very variable, but they are obviously related to one another, the\r\nsoils which absorb it least abundantly parting with it again with the\r\ngreatest, facility; for it appears that siliceous sand absorbs only\r\none-fourth of its weight of water, and again gives off in the course of\r\nfour hours four-fifths of that it had taken up, while humus, which\r\nimbibes nearly twice its weight, retains nine-tenths of that quantity\r\nafter four hours' exposure. Long-continued and slow evaporation of the\r\nwater absorbed by a soil is injurious in another way, for it makes the\r\nsoil \"cold\"--a term of practical origin, but which very correctly\r\nexpresses the peculiarity in question. It is due to the fact, that when\r\nwater evaporates it absorbs a very large quantity of heat, which\r\nprevents the soil acquiring a sufficiently high temperature from the\r\nsun's rays. The soils which have absorbed a large quantity of moisture\r\nshrink more or less in the process of drying, and form cracks, which\r\noften break the delicate fibres of the roots of the plants, and cause\r\nconsiderable injury: the extent of this shrinking is given in the fourth\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the soils to heat divides itself into two\r\nconsiderations: the amount of heat absorbed by the soil, and the degree\r\nin which it is retained. Of these the latter only is illustrated in the\r\ntable. The former is dependent on so many special considerations, that\r\nthe results cannot be tabulated in a satisfactory manner. It is\r\nindependent of the chemical nature of the soil, but varies to a great\r\nextent according to its colour, the angle of incidence of the sun's\r\nrays, and its state of moisture. It is, however, an important character,\r\nand has been found by Girardin to exercise a considerable influence on\r\nthe rapidity with which the crop ripens. He found in a particular year\r\nthat, on the 25th of August, 26 varieties of potatoes were ripe on a\r\nvery dark-coloured sandy vegetable mould, 20 on an ordinary sandy soil,\r\n19 on a loamy soil, and only 16 on a nearly white calcareous soil.\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of the soil is very variable, and indicates the great\r\ndifferences in the amount of power which must be expended in working\r\nthem. According to Schuebler, a soil whose tenacity does not exceed 10,\r\nis easily tilled, but when it reaches 40 it becomes very difficult and\r\nheavy to work.\r\n\r\nOn examining the table it becomes manifest, that as far as its\r\nmechanical properties are concerned, humus is a substance of the very\r\nhighest importance, for it confers on the soil, in a high degree, the\r\npower of absorbing and retaining water, diminishes its tenacity and\r\npermits its being more easily worked, adds to its hygrometric power and\r\nproperty of absorbing oxygen from the air, and finally, from its dark\r\ncolour, causes the more rapid absorption of heat from the sun's rays. It\r\nwill be thus understood, that though it does not directly supply food to\r\nthe plant, it ministers indirectly in a most important manner to its\r\nwell-being, and that to so great an extent that it must be considered an\r\nindispensable constituent of a fertile soil. But it is important to\r\nobserve that it must not be present in too large a quantity, for an\r\nexcess does away with all the good effects of a smaller supply, and\r\nproduces soils notorious for their infertility.\r\n\r\nSuch are the important physical properties of the soil, and it is\r\ngreatly to be desired that they should be more extensively examined. The\r\ngreat labour which this involves has, however, hitherto prevented its\r\nbeing done, and will, in all probability, render it impossible except in\r\na limited number of cases. Some of these characters are, however, of\r\nminor importance, and for ordinary purposes it might be sufficient to\r\ndetermine the specific gravity of the soil in the dry and moist state,\r\nthe power of imbibing and retaining water, its hygrometric power, its\r\ntenacity, and its colour. With these data we should be in a condition to\r\ndraw probable conclusions regarding the others; for the higher the\r\nspecific gravity in the dry state, the greater is the power of the soil\r\nto retain heat, and the darker its colour the more readily does it\r\nabsorb it. The greater its tenacity the more difficult is it to work,\r\nand the greater difficulty will the roots of the young plant find in\r\npushing their way through it. The greater the power of imbibing water,\r\nthe more it shrinks in drying; and the more slowly the water evaporates,\r\nthe colder is the soil produced. The hygrometric power is so important a\r\ncharacter that Davy and other chemists have even believed it possible to\r\nmake it the measure of the fertility of a soil; but though this may be\r\ntrue within certain limits, it must not be too broadly assumed, the\r\nresults of recent experiments by no means confirming the opinion in its\r\nintegrity, but indicating only some relation between the two.\r\n\r\n_The Subsoil._--The term soil is strictly confined to that portion of\r\nthe surface turned over by the plough working at ordinary depth; which,\r\nas a general rule, may be taken at 10 inches. The portion immediately\r\nsubjacent is called the subsoil, and it has considerable agricultural\r\nimportance, and requires a short notice. In many instances, soil and\r\nsubsoil are separated by a purely imaginary line, and no striking\r\ndifference can be observed either in their chemical or physical\r\ncharacters. In such cases it has been the practice with some persons not\r\nto limit the term soil to the upper portion, but to apply it to the\r\nwhole depth, however great it may be, which agrees in characters with\r\nthe upper part, and only to call that subsoil which manifestly differs\r\nfrom it. This principle is perhaps theoretically the more correct, but\r\ngreat practical advantages are derived from limiting the name of soil to\r\nthe depth actually worked in common agricultural operations. The subsoil\r\nis always analogous in its general characters to a soil, but it may be\r\neither identical with that which overlies it or not. Of the former,\r\nstriking illustrations are seen in the wheat subsoils, the analyses of\r\nwhich have been already given. In the latter case great differences may\r\nexist, and a heavy clay is often found lying on an open and porous sand,\r\nor on peat, and _vice versa_. Even where the characters of the subsoil\r\nappear the same as those of the soil, appreciable chemical differences\r\nare generally observed, especially in the quantity of organic matter,\r\nwhich is increased in the soil by the decay of plants growing upon it\r\nand by the manure added. In general, then, all that we have said\r\nregarding the characters of soils both chemically and physically, will\r\napply to the subsoils, except that, owing to the difficulty with which\r\nthe air reaches the latter, some minor peculiarities are observed. The\r\nmost important is the effect of the decay of vegetable matter, without\r\naccess of air, which is attended by the reduction of the peroxide of\r\niron to the state of protoxide, and not unfrequently by the production\r\nof sulphuret of iron, compounds which are extremely prejudicial to\r\nvegetation, and occasionally give rise to some difficulties when the\r\nsubsoil is brought to the surface, as we shall afterwards have to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe physical characters of the subsoil are often of much importance to\r\nthe soil itself. As, for instance, where a light soil lies on a clay\r\nsubsoil, in which case its value is much higher than if it reposed on an\r\nopen or sandy subsoil. And in many similar modes an important influence\r\nis exerted; but these belong more strictly to the practical department\r\nof agriculture, and need not be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Soils._--Numerous attempts have been made to form a\r\nclassification of soils according to their characters and value, but\r\nthey have not hitherto proved very successful; and the result of more\r\nrecent chemical investigations has not been such as to encourage a\r\nfarther attempt. We have not at present data sufficient for the purpose,\r\nnor, if we had, would it be possible to arrange any soil in its class\r\nexcept after an elaborate chemical examination. The only classification\r\nat present possible must be founded on the general physical characters\r\nof the soil; and the ordinary mode followed in practice of dividing them\r\ninto clays, loams, etc. etc., which we need not here particularize,\r\nfulfils all that can be done until we have more minute information\r\nregarding a large number of soils. Those of our readers who desire more\r\nfull information on this point are referred to the works of Thaer,\r\nSchuebler, and others, where the subject is minutely discussed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society, vol.\r\nvi., p. 317.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOIL BY MECHANICAL PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparatively few uncultivated soils possess the physical properties or\r\nchemical composition required for the production of the most abundant\r\ncrops. Either one or more of the substances essential to the growth of\r\nplants are absent, or, if present, they are deficient in quantity, or\r\nexist in some state in which they cannot be absorbed. Such defects,\r\nwhether mechanical or chemical, admit of diminution, or even entire\r\nremoval, by certain methods of treatment, the adaptation of which to\r\nparticular cases is necessarily one of the most important branches of\r\nagricultural practice, as the elucidation of their mode of action is of\r\nits theory. The observations already made with regard to the characters\r\nof fertile soils must have prepared the reader for the statement that\r\nthese defects may be removed, either by mechanical or chemical\r\nprocesses. The former method of improvement may at first sight appear to\r\nfall more strictly under the head of practical agriculture, of which the\r\nmechanical treatment of the soil forms so important a part, and that\r\ntheir improvement by chemical means should form the sole subject of our\r\nconsideration in a treatise on agricultural chemistry. But the line of\r\ndemarcation between the mechanical and the chemical, which seems so\r\nmarked, disappears on more minute observation, and we find that the\r\nmechanical methods of improvement are frequently dependent on chemical\r\nprinciples; and those which, at first sight, appear to be entirely\r\nchemical, are also in reality partly mechanical. It will be necessary\r\nfor us, therefore, to consider shortly the mechanical methods of\r\nimproving the soil.\r\n\r\n_Draining._--By far the most important method of mechanically improving\r\nthe soil is by draining--a practice the beneficial action of which is\r\ndependent on a great variety of circumstances. It is unnecessary to\r\ninsist on the advantage derived from the rapid removal of moisture,\r\nwhich enables the soil to be worked at times when this used to be almost\r\nimpossible, and other direct practical benefits. Of its more strictly\r\nchemical effects, the most important is probably that which it produces\r\non the temperature of the soil. It has been already remarked that the\r\ngermination of a seed is dependent on the soil in which it is sown\r\nacquiring a certain temperature, and the rapidity of the after-growth of\r\nthe plant is, in part at least, dependent on the same circumstance. The\r\nnecessary temperature is speedily attained by the heating action of the\r\nsun's rays, when the soil is dry; but when it is wet, the heat is\r\nexpended in evaporating the moisture with which it is saturated; and it\r\nis only after this has been effected that it acquires a sufficiently\r\nhigh temperature to produce the rapid growth of the seeds committed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this effect occurs may be best illustrated by\r\nreference to some experiments made by Schuebler, in which he determined\r\nthe temperature attained by different soils, in the wet and dry state,\r\nwhen exposed to the sun's rays, from 11 till 3 o'clock, in the latter\r\npart of August, when the temperature in the shade varied from 73 deg. to\r\n77 deg..\r\n\r\n+-----------------------+-------+-------+\r\n| Description of Soil.  | Wet.  | Dry.  |\r\n+-----------------------+-------+-------+\r\n|                       | Degs. | Degs. |\r\n| Siliceous sand        |  99.1 | 112.6 |\r\n| Calcareous sand       |  99.3 | 112.1 |\r\n| Sandy clay            |  98.2 | 111.4 |\r\n| Loamy clay            |  99.1 | 112.1 |\r\n| Stiff clay            |  99.3 | 112.3 |\r\n| Fine bluish-grey clay |  99.5 | 113.0 |\r\n| Garden mould          |  99.5 | 113.5 |\r\n| Arable soil           |  97.7 | 111.7 |\r\n| Slaty marl            | 101.8 | 115.3 |\r\n+-----------------------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nIn a soil which is naturally dry or has been drained, the superfluous\r\nmoisture escapes by the drains, and only that comparatively small\r\nquantity which is retained by capillary attraction is evaporated, and\r\nhence the soil is more frequently and for a longer period in a condition\r\nto take advantage of the heating effect of the sun's rays, and in this\r\nway the period of germination, and, by consequence also, that of\r\nripening is advanced. The extent of this influence is necessarily\r\nvariable, but it is generally considerable, and in some districts of\r\nScotland the extensive introduction of draining has made the harvest, on\r\nthe average of years, from ten to fourteen days earlier than it was\r\nbefore. It is unnecessary to insist on the importance of such a change,\r\nwhich in upland districts may make cultivation successful when it was\r\npreviously almost impossible. The removal of moisture by drainage\r\naffects the physical characters of the soil in another manner; it makes\r\nit lighter, more friable, and more easily worked; and this change is\r\noccasioned by the downward flow of the water carrying with it to the\r\nlower part of the soil the finer argillaceous particles, leaving the\r\ncoarser and sandy matters above, and in this way a marked improvement is\r\nproduced on heavy and retentive clays. The access of air to the soil is\r\nalso greatly promoted by draining. In wet soils the pores are filled\r\nwith water, and hence the air, which is so important an agent in their\r\namelioration, is excluded; but so soon as this is removed, the air is\r\nenabled to reach and act upon the organic matters and other decomposable\r\nconstituents present. In this way also provision is made for the\r\nfrequent change of the air which permeates the soil; for every shower\r\nthat falls expels from it a quantity of that which it contains, and as\r\nthe moisture flows off by the drains, a new supply enters to take its\r\nplace, and thus the important changes which the atmospheric oxygen\r\nproduces on the soil are promoted in a high degree. The air which thus\r\nenters acts on the organic matters of the soil, producing carbonic acid,\r\nwhich we have already seen is so intimately connected with many of its\r\nchemical changes. In its absence the organic matters undergo different\r\ndecompositions, and pass into states in which they are slowly acted on,\r\nand are incapable of supplying a sufficient quantity of carbonic acid to\r\nthe soil; and they thus exercise an action on the peroxide of iron,\r\ncontained in all soils, reduce it to the state of protoxide, or, with\r\nthe simultaneous reduction of the sulphuric acid, they produce sulphuret\r\nof iron, forms of combination which are well known to be most injurious\r\nto vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe removal of water from the lower part of the soil, and the admission\r\nof air, which is the consequence of draining, submits that part of it to\r\nthe same changes which take place in its upper portion, and has the\r\neffect of practically deepening the soil to the extent to which it is\r\nthus laid dry. The roots of the plants growing on the soil, which stop\r\nas soon as they reach the moist part, now descend to a lower level, and\r\nderive from that part of it supplies of nourishment formerly\r\nunavailable. The deepening of the soil has further the effect of making\r\nthe plants which grow upon it less liable to be burned up in seasons of\r\ndrought, a somewhat unexpected result of making a soil drier, but which\r\nmanifestly depends on its permitting the roots to penetrate to a greater\r\ndepth, and so to get beyond the surface portion, which is rapidly dried\r\nup, and to which they were formerly confined.\r\n\r\nIt may be added also that the abundant escape of water from the drains\r\nacts chemically by removing any noxious matters the soil may contain,\r\nand by diminishing the amount of soluble saline matters, which sometimes\r\nproduce injurious effects. It thus prevents the saline incrustation\r\nfrequently seen in dry seasons on soils which are naturally wet, and\r\nwhich is produced by the water rising to the surface by capillary\r\nattraction, and, as it evaporates, depositing the soluble substances it\r\ncontained, as a hard crust which prevents the access of air to the\r\ninterior of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that the drainage of the soil modifies its properties\r\nboth mechanically and chemically. It exerts also various other actions\r\nin particular cases which we cannot here stop to particularize. It\r\nameliorates the climate of districts in which it is extensively carried\r\nout, and even affects the health of the population in a favourable\r\nmanner. The sum of its effects must necessarily differ greatly in\r\ndifferent soils, and in different districts; but a competent\r\nauthority[J] has estimated, that, on the average, land which has been\r\ndrained produces a quarter more grain per acre than that which is\r\nundrained. But this by no means exhausts the benefits derived from it,\r\ndraining being merely the precursor of further improvement. It is only\r\nafter it has been carried out that the farmer derives the full benefit\r\nof the manures which he applies. He gains also by the increased facility\r\nof working the soil, and by the rapidity with which it dries after\r\ncontinued rain, thus enabling him to proceed at their proper season with\r\nagricultural operations, which would otherwise have to be postponed for\r\na considerable time.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place to enlarge here upon the mode in which draining\r\nought to be carried out; it may be remarked, however, that much\r\ninconvenience and loss has occasionally been produced by too close\r\nadherence to particular systems. No rules can be laid down as to the\r\ndepth or distance between the drains which can be universally\r\napplicable, but the intelligent drainer will seek to modify his practice\r\naccording to the circumstances of the case. As a general rule, the\r\ndrains ought to be as deep as possible, but in numerous instances it may\r\nbe more advantageous to curtail their depth and increase their number.\r\nIf, for instance, a thick impervious pan resting on a clay were found at\r\nthe depth of three feet below the surface, it would serve no good\r\npurpose to make the drains deeper; but if the pan were thin, and the\r\nsubjacent layer readily permeable by water, it might be advantageous to\r\ngo down to the depth of four feet, trusting to the possible action of\r\nthe air which would thus be admitted, gradually to disintegrate the pan,\r\nand increase the depth of soil above it. It is a common opinion that if\r\nwe reach, at a moderate depth, a tenacious and little permeable clay, no\r\nadvantage is obtained by sinking the drains into it; but this is an\r\nopinion which should be adopted with caution, both because no clay is\r\nabsolutely impermeable, even the most tenacious permitting to a certain\r\nextent the passage of water, and because the clay may have been brought\r\ndown by water from the upper part of the soil, and may have stopped\r\nthere merely for want of some deeper escape for the water, and which\r\ndrains at a lower level might supply. In some cases it may even be\r\nadvisable to vary the depth of the drains in different parts of the same\r\nfield, and the judicious drainer may sometimes save a considerable sum\r\nby a careful observation of the peculiarities of the different parts of\r\nthe ground to be drained.\r\n\r\n_Subsoil and Deep Ploughing._--It frequently happens, when a soil is\r\ndrained, that the subsoil is so stiff as to permit the passage of water\r\nimperfectly, and to prevent the tender roots of the plant from\r\npenetrating it, and reaching the new supplies of nourishment which are\r\nlaid open to them. In such cases the benefits of subsoil ploughing and\r\ndeep ploughing are conspicuous. The mode of action of these two methods\r\nof treatment is similar but not identical. The subsoil plough merely\r\nstirs and opens the subsoil, and permits the more ready passage of water\r\nand the access of air and of the roots of plants--the former to effect\r\nthe necessary decompositions, the latter to avail themselves of the\r\nvaluable matters set free. But deep ploughing produces more extensive\r\nchanges; it raises new soil to the surface, mixes it with the original\r\nsoil, and thus not only brings up fresh supplies of valuable matters to\r\nit, but frequently changes its chemical and mechanical characters,\r\nrendering a heavy soil lighter by the admixture of a light subsoil, and\r\n_vice versa_. Both are operations which are useless unless they are\r\ncombined with draining, for it must manifestly serve no good purpose to\r\nattempt to open up a soil unless the water which lies in it be\r\npreviously removed. In fact, subsoiling is useless unless the subsoil\r\nhas been made thoroughly dry; and it has been found by experience that\r\nno good effects are obtained if it be attempted immediately after\r\ndraining, but that a sufficient time must elapse, in order to permit the\r\nescape of the accumulated moisture, which often takes place very slowly.\r\nWithout this precaution, the subsoil, after being opened by the plough,\r\nsoon sinks together, and the good effects anticipated are not realized.\r\nThe necessity for allowing some time to elapse between draining and\r\nfurther operations is still more apparent in deep ploughing, when the\r\nsoil is actually brought to the surface. In that case it requires to be\r\nleft for a longer period after draining, in order that the air may\r\nproduce the necessary changes on the subsoil; for if it be brought up\r\nafter having been for a long time saturated with moisture, and\r\ncontaining its iron as protoxide, and the organic matter in a state in\r\nwhich it is not readily acted upon by the air, the immediate effect of\r\nthe operation is frequently injurious in place of being advantageous.\r\nOne of the best methods of treating a soil in this way is to make the\r\noperation a gradual one, and by deepening an inch or two every year\r\ngradually to mix the soil and subsoil; as in this way from a small\r\nquantity being brought up at a time no injurious effects are produced.\r\nDeep ploughing may be said to act in two ways, _firstly_, by again\r\nbringing to the surface the manures which have a tendency to sink to the\r\nlower part of the soil, and, _secondly_, by bringing up a soil which has\r\nnot been exhausted by previous cropping--in fact a virgin soil.\r\n\r\nThe success which attends the operation of subsoiling or deep ploughing\r\nmust manifestly be greatly dependent on the character of the subsoil,\r\nand good effects can only be obtained when its chemical composition is\r\nsuch as to supply in increased quantity the essential constituents of\r\nthe plant; and it is no doubt owing to this that the opinions\r\nentertained by practical men, each of whom speaks from the results of\r\nhis own experience, are so varied. The effects produced by deep\r\nploughing on the estates of the Marquis of Tweeddale, are familiarly\r\nknown to most Scottish agriculturists, and they are at once explained by\r\nthe analyses of the soil and subsoil here given, which show that the\r\nlatter, though poor in some important constituents, contains more than\r\ntwice as much potash as the soil.\r\n\r\n                                 Soil.

In other instances, the use of\r\nthe subsoil plough has occasioned much disappointment, and has led to\r\nits being decried by many practical men; but of late years its use\r\nhaving become better understood, its merits are more generally\r\nadmitted. We believe, that in all cases in which the soil is deep, more\r\nor less marked good effects must be produced by its use, but of course\r\nthere must be cases in which, from the defective composition of the\r\nsubsoil or other causes, it must fail. It may sometimes be possible _a\r\npriori_ to detect these cases, but in a large majority of them our\r\nknowledge is still too limited to admit of satisfactory conclusions\r\nbeing arrived at.\r\n\r\n_Improving the Soil by Paring and Burning._--It has long been familiarly\r\nknown, that a decided improvement has been produced on some soils by\r\nburning. Its advantages have chiefly been observed on two sorts, heavy\r\nclays and peat soils, on both of which it has been practised to a great\r\nextent. The action of heat on the heavy clays appears to be of a twofold\r\ncharacter, depending partly on the change effected in its physical\r\nproperties, and partly on a chemical decomposition produced by the heat.\r\nThe operation of burning is effected by mixing the clay with brushwood\r\nand vegetable refuse, and allowing it to smoulder in small heaps for\r\nsome time. It is a process of some nicety, and its success is greatly\r\ndependent on the care which has been taken to keep the temperature as\r\nlow as possible during the whole course of the burning.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that burning is by no means equally advantageous to\r\nall clays, but is most beneficial on those containing a considerable\r\nquantity of calcareous matter, and of silicates of potash. In such clays\r\nheat operates by causing the lime to decompose the alkaline silicates,\r\nand liberate a quantity of the potash which was previously in an\r\nunavailable state. Its effect may be best illustrated by the following\r\nanalyses by Dr. Voelcker of a soil, and the red ash produced in burning\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                                  Soil.

In order to obtain these\r\nresults, it is necessary, as has been already observed, to keep the\r\ntemperature as low as possible during the process of burning, direct\r\nexperiment having shown that when this precaution is not observed\r\nanother change occurs, whereby the potash, which at low temperatures\r\nbecomes soluble, passes again into an insoluble state. A part of the\r\nbeneficial effect is no doubt also due to the change produced in the\r\nphysical characters of the clay by burning, which makes it lighter and\r\nmore friable, and by mixture with the unburnt clay ameliorates the\r\nwhole. This improvement in the physical characters of the clay also\r\nrequires that it shall be burnt with as low a heat as possible; for if\r\nit rises too high, the clay coheres into hard masses which cannot again\r\nbe reduced to powder, and the success of the operation of burning may\r\nalways be judged of by the readiness with which it falls into a uniform\r\nfriable powder.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of peat by burning has been practised to some extent in\r\nScotland, though less frequently of late years than formerly; but it is\r\nstill the principal method of reclaiming peat soils in many countries,\r\nand particularly in Finland, where large breadths of land have been\r\nbrought into profitable cultivation by means of it. The _modus operandi_\r\nof burning peat is very simple; it acts by diminishing the superabundant\r\nquantity of humus or other organic matters, which, in the previous\r\nsection we have seen to be so injurious to the fertility of the soil. It\r\n_may_ act also in the same way as it does on clay, by making part of the\r\ninorganic constituents more really soluble, although it is not probable\r\nthat its effect in this way can be very marked. Its chief action is\r\ncertainly by destroying the organic matters, and by thus improving the\r\nphysical character of the peat, and causing it to absorb and retain a\r\nsmaller quantity of water than it naturally does. For this reason it is\r\nthat it proves successful only on thin peat bogs, for if they be deep,\r\nthe inorganic matters soon sink into the lower part, and the surface\r\nrelapses into its old state of infertility. It is probably for this\r\nreason that the practice has been so much abandoned in Scotland, more\r\nespecially as other and more economical modes of treating peat soils\r\nhave come into use.\r\n\r\n_Warping._--This name has been given to a method of improving soils by\r\ncausing the water of rivers to deposit the mud it carries in suspension\r\nupon them, and which has been largely practised in the low lying lands\r\nof Lincoln and Yorkshire, where it was introduced about a century ago.\r\nIt is most beneficial on sandy or peaty soil, and by its means large\r\ntracts of worthless land have been brought under profitable cultivation.\r\nIt requires that the land to be so treated shall be under the level of\r\nthe river at full tide, and it is managed by providing a sluice through\r\nwhich the river water is allowed to flood the land at high tide, and\r\nagain to escape at ebb, leaving a layer of mud generally about a tenth\r\nof an inch in thickness, which it brought along with it. By the\r\nrepetition of this process, a layer of several feet in thickness, of an\r\nexcellent soil, is accumulated on the surface. Herapath, who has\r\ncarefully examined this subject chemically, has shown that in one\r\nexperiment where the water used contained 233 grains of mud per gallon,\r\n210 were deposited during the warping. The following analyses will show\r\nthe general nature of the matters deposited, and the change which they\r\nproduce on the soil:--No. 1 is the mud from the Humber in its natural\r\nstate, No. 2 a specimen of warp of average quality artificially dried,\r\nNo. 3 a sandy soil before warping, and No. 4, the same fifteen years\r\nafter having received a coating of 11 inches of mud.\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n|                                 |   1     |   2    |   3     |  4     |\r\n|                                 +---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n| Water                           |   47.49 |    ... |    1.06 |   2.00 |\r\n| Organic matter                  |    5.94 |   6.93 |    2.20 |   7.61 |\r\n| Chloride of Calcium             |     ... |    ... | }   ... |    ... |\r\n|     Magnesium                   | }   ... |   0.10 | }   ... |    ... |\r\n|     Sodium                      | }  1.66 | } 0.94 | }  0.14 |   0.16 |\r\n|     Potassium                   | }       | }      | }       |        |\r\n| Sulphate of Soda                | }   ... |   0.31 | }   ... |    ... |\r\n|     Magnesia                    | }   ... |   1.18 | }   ... |    ... |\r\n|     Lime                        |   trace |   1.10 |   trace |  trace |\r\n| Carbonate of Magnesia           |    2.60 |   0.31 |   trace |   0.29 |\r\n|     Lime                        |    3.59 |   8.18 |   trace |   0.46 |\r\n| Potash and Soda                 |    0.18 |   0.47 |   trace |   0.17 |\r\n| Magnesia                        |    1.69 |   2.60 |   trace |   0.26 |\r\n| Lime                            |    0.39 |   0.68 |   trace |   0.14 |\r\n| Peroxide of Iron                | }  6.63 |   5.05 |    0.08 |   1.17 |\r\n| Alumina                         | }       |   8.18 |    0.39 |   0.41 |\r\n| Phosphate of Iron               |    0.58 |   1.04 |   trace |   0.28 |\r\n| Silica                          |     ... |   9.05 |    0.14 |   2.77 |\r\n| Sand and Stones                 |   29.15 |  55.87 |   95.91 |  84.97 |\r\n|                                 |---------|--------|---------|--------|\r\n|                                 |  100.00 | 100.00 |  100.00 | 100.00 |\r\n+---------------------------------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the importance of the effects produced by\r\nadding to any soil large quantities of a mud containing upwards of one\r\nper cent of phosphate of iron; and in point of fact, Herapath has\r\ncalculated that in one particular instance the quantity of phosphoric\r\nacid brought by warping upon an acre of land, exceeded seven tons per\r\nacre. As, moreover, the matters are all in a high state of division,\r\nthey must exist in a condition peculiarly favourable to the plant. The\r\noverflow of the Nile is only an instance of warping on the large scale,\r\nwith this difference, that it is repeated once only in every year,\r\nwhereas, in this country, the operation is repeated at every tide until\r\na deposit sometimes of several feet in thickness is obtained, after\r\nwhich it is stopped, and the soil brought under ordinary cultivation.\r\n\r\nAn operation which is, in some respects, the converse of warping, has\r\nbeen carried out on Blair-Drummond Moss, where the peat has been\r\ndislodged and carried off by the action of water, leaving the subjacent\r\nsoil in a state fitted for cropping. Of course both this and warping are\r\nrestricted to special localities, but they are most important means of\r\nameliorating the soil when circumstances admit of their being carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\n_Mixing of Soils._--When soils possess conspicuous defects in their\r\nphysical, and even in their chemical properties, great advantages may,\r\nin some instances, be derived from their proper admixture. A light sandy\r\nsoil, for instance, is greatly improved by the addition of clay, and\r\n_vice versa_; so that, when two soils of opposite properties occur near\r\nto one another, both may be improved by mixture. It has been applied to\r\nthe improvement of heavy clay soil and of peat, the former being mixed\r\nwith sand or marl so as to diminish its tenacity; the latter with clay\r\nor gravel to add to its inorganic matters, and in both instances it has\r\nproved successful.\r\n\r\nThe process of chalking, which has been carried out on a large scale in\r\nsome parts of England, and which consists in bringing up the chalk from\r\npits, penetrating through the overlying tenacious clay, and mixing it\r\nwith the soil, operates, to some extent, in a similar manner, though no\r\ndoubt the lime also exercises a strictly chemical action. It is probable\r\nthat the mixing of soils might be advantageously extended, and it merits\r\nmore minute study than it has yet obtained. Its use is obviously limited\r\nby the expense, because, of course, where good effects are to be\r\nobtained, it is necessary to remove large quantities of soil, in some\r\ninstances as much as 50 or 100 tons per acre, but the expense might be\r\nmuch diminished if it were carried out methodically, and on a\r\nconsiderable scale. The admixture of highly fertile soils with others of\r\ninferior quality is also worthy of attention; indeed, it is understood\r\nthat this has been done, to some extent, with the rich trap soils of\r\nsome parts of Scotland, but the extent of the benefit derived from it\r\nhas not been made public.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Mr. Dudgeon, Spylaw. Transactions of the Highland Society,\r\nvol. cxxix., p. 505.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their natural condition all soils not absolutely barren are capable\r\nof supporting a certain amount of vegetation, and they continue to do so\r\nfor an unlimited period, because the whole of the substances extracted\r\nfrom them are again restored, either directly by the decay of the\r\nplants, or indirectly by the droppings of the wild animals which have\r\nbrowzed upon them. Under these circumstances, a soil yields what may be\r\ncalled its normal produce, which varies within comparatively narrow\r\nlimits, according to the nature of the season, temperature, and other\r\nclimatic conditions. But the case is completely altered if the crop, in\r\nplace of being allowed to decay on the soil, is removed from it, for,\r\nthough the air will continue to afford an undiminished supply of those\r\nelements of the food of plants which may be derived from it, the fixed\r\nsubstances, which can only be obtained from the soil, decrease in\r\nquantity, and are at length entirely exhausted. In this way a gradual\r\ndiminution of the fertility of the soil takes place, until, after the\r\nlapse of a period, longer or shorter, according to its natural\r\nresources, it will become entirely incapable of maintaining a crop, and\r\nfall into absolute infertility unless the substances removed from it are\r\nrestored from some other source in the form of manure. When this is\r\ndone, the fertility of the soil may not only be sustained but greatly\r\nincreased, and, in point of fact, all cultivated soils, by the use of\r\nmanure, are made to yield a much larger crop than they can do in their\r\nnatural condition.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle upon which a manure is employed is that of\r\nadding to the soil an abundant supply of the elements removed from it by\r\nplants in the condition best fitted for absorption by their roots; but\r\nlooked at in its broadest point of view, it acts not merely in this way,\r\nbut also by promoting the decomposition of the already partially\r\ndisintegrated rocks of which the soil is composed, setting free those\r\nsubstances it already contains, and facilitating their absorption by the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn considering the practical applications of the broad general principle\r\njust stated, it might be assumed that a manure ought invariably to\r\ncontain all the elements of plants in the quantities in which they are\r\nremoved by the crops, and that when this has been accurately ascertained\r\nby analysis, it would only be necessary to use the various substances in\r\nthe proportions thus indicated. But this, though a very important, and\r\nno doubt in many cases essential condition, is by no means the only\r\nmatter which requires to be taken into consideration in the economical\r\napplication of manures. And this becomes sufficiently obvious when the\r\ncircumstances attending the exhaustion of the soil are minutely\r\nexamined. When a soil is cropped during a succession of years with the\r\nsame plant, and at length becomes incapable of longer maintaining it,\r\nthe exhaustion is rarely, if ever, due to the simultaneous consumption\r\nof all its different constituents, but generally depends upon that of\r\none individual substance, which, from its having originally existed in\r\nthe soil in comparatively small quantity, is removed in a shorter time\r\nthan the others. To restore the fertility of a soil in this condition,\r\nit is by no means necessary to supply all the different substances\r\nrequired by the plant, for it will suffice to add that which has been\r\nentirely removed. On the other hand, if an ordinary soil be supplied\r\nwith a manure containing a very small quantity of one of the elements of\r\nplant food, along with abundance of all the others, the amount of\r\nincrease which it yields must obviously be measured, not by those which\r\nare abundant, but by that which is deficient; for the crop which grows\r\nluxuriantly so long as it obtains a supply of all its constituents, is\r\narrested as effectually by the want of one as of all, as has been proved\r\nby the experiments of Prince Salm Horstmar and others, referred to in a\r\nprevious chapter; and hence, in order to obtain a good crop, it would be\r\nnecessary to use the manure in such abundance as to supply a sufficiency\r\nof the deficient element for that purpose. If this course were\r\npersevered in for a succession of years, the other substances which\r\nwould have been used in much more than the quantity required by the\r\ncrops, must either have been entirely lost or have accumulated in the\r\nsoil. In the latter case it is sufficiently obvious that the soil must\r\nhave been gradually acquiring an amount of resources which must remain\r\ndormant until the system of manuring is changed. To render them\r\navailable, it is only necessary to add to it a quantity of the\r\nparticular substance in which the manure hitherto employed has been\r\ndeficient, so as to restore the lost balance, and enable the plant to\r\nmake use of those which have been stored up within it. The substance so\r\nused is called a _special_ manure; that containing all the constituents\r\nof the crop is a _general_ manure.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of these two classes of manures is very important in a\r\npractical point of view, because a special manure is not by itself\r\ncapable of maintaining the life of plants, but is only a means of\r\nbringing into use the natural and acquired resources of the soil. In\r\nplace of preventing or retarding its exhaustion, it rather accelerates\r\nit by causing the increased crops to consume more abundantly, and within\r\na shorter period of time, those substances which it contains. On the\r\nother hand, a general manure prevents or diminishes the consumption of\r\nthe elements of plant-food contained in the soil, and if added in\r\nsufficient abundance, may cause them to accumulate in it, and even\r\nenable an almost absolutely barren soil to yield a tolerable crop.\r\nGeneral manures must therefore always be the most important and\r\nessential, and no others would be used if it were possible to obtain\r\nthem of a composition exactly suited to the requirements of the crop to\r\nbe raised. Practically, however, this condition cannot be fulfilled,\r\nbecause all the substances available for the purpose, and particularly\r\nfarm-yard manure, are refuse matters, the exact composition of which is\r\nnot under our control, and they do not necessarily contain their\r\nconstituents either in the most suitable proportions, or the most\r\navailable forms, and consequently when they are used during a succession\r\nof years, certain of their constituents may accumulate in the soil, and\r\nit is under such circumstances that special manures are both necessary\r\nand advantageous.\r\n\r\nSeveral different substances, but more especially farm-yard manure,\r\nfulfil in a very remarkable manner the conditions of a general manure,\r\nand supply abundantly, not merely the mineral, but also the carbonaceous\r\nand nitrogenous matters necessary for building up the organic part of\r\nthe plant; and hence its use is governed by principles of comparative\r\nsimplicity, and really resolves itself into determining the best mode of\r\nmanaging it so as effectually to preserve its useful constituents, and,\r\nat the same time, to bring them into those forms of combination in which\r\nthey are most available to the plant. But the employment of a special\r\nmanure opens up nice questions as to the relative importance of the\r\ndifferent elements of plants which have given rise to much controversy\r\nand difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the food of plants, it has been already observed that the\r\nfixed or mineral constituents which are contained in their ash, are\r\nnecessarily derived exclusively from the soil, but that the carbon,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, of which their organic part is composed,\r\nmay be obtained either from that source or from the air. The important\r\ndistinction which thus exists between these two classes of substances,\r\nhas given rise to two different views regarding the theory of manures.\r\nBasing his views on the presence of the organic elements in the air,\r\nLiebig has maintained that it is unnecessary to supply them in the\r\nmanure, while others, among whom Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert have taken a\r\nprominent position, hold that, as a rule, fertile soils, cultivated in\r\nthe ordinary manner, contain a sufficient supply of mineral matters for\r\nthe production of the largest possible crops, but that the quantity of\r\nammonia and nitric acid which the plants are capable of extracting from\r\nthe air is insufficient, and must be supplemented by manures containing\r\nthem. A large number of experiments have been made in support of these\r\nviews, but the inferences which can be drawn from them are not\r\nabsolutely conclusive on either side, and it is necessary to consider\r\nthe matter in a general point of view.\r\n\r\nSetting out from the proposition already so frequently referred to, that\r\nthe plant cannot grow unless it receives a supply of all its elements,\r\nit must be obvious that if, to a soil containing a sufficiency of\r\nmineral matters to raise a given number of crops, a supply of ammonia be\r\nadded, its total productive capacity cannot be thus increased; and\r\nthough it may yield larger crops than it would have done without that\r\nsubstance, this can only be accomplished by a proportionate diminution\r\nof their number. In either case, the same quantity of vegetable matter\r\nwill be produced, but the time within which it is obtained will be\r\nregulated by the supply of ammonia. That substance differs in no respect\r\nfrom any other element of plant-food, and used in this way is to all\r\nintents and purposes a special manure, and acts merely by bringing into\r\nplay those substances which the soil already contains. Its effect may\r\nnot be apparent until after the lapse of a very long period of time, but\r\nit ultimately leads to the exhaustion of the soil. If, on the other\r\nhand, a soil be continuously cropped until it ceases to yield any\r\nproduce, it is manifest that the exhaustion must in this instance be\r\nentirely due to the removal of its available mineral nutriment, because\r\nthe superincumbent air constantly changed by the winds must continue to\r\nafford the same unvarying supply of the organic elements, and the power\r\nof supporting vegetation would be restored to it, by adding the\r\nnecessary inorganic matters. Hence when a soil, which in its natural\r\ncondition is capable of yielding a certain amount of vegetable matter,\r\nis rendered barren by the removal of the crop, it may be laid down as an\r\nincontrovertible position, that its infertility is due to the loss of\r\nmineral matters, and that it may be restored to its pristine condition\r\nby the use of them, and of them only.\r\n\r\nBut the case is materially altered when we come to consider the course\r\nof events in a cultivated soil. The object of agriculture is to cause\r\nthe soil, by appropriate treatment, to yield much more than its normal\r\nproduce, and the question is, how this can be best and most economically\r\neffected in practice. According to Liebig, it is attained by adding to\r\nthe soil a liberal supply of those mineral substances required by the\r\nplant, and that it is unnecessary to use any of the organic elements,\r\nbecause they are supplied by the air in sufficient quantity to meet the\r\nrequirements of the most abundant crops. Other chemists and vegetable\r\nphysiologists again hold that though a certain increase may be obtained\r\nin this way, a point is soon reached beyond which mineral matters will\r\nnot cause the plant to absorb more ammonia from the air, although a\r\nfurther increase may be obtained by the addition of nitrogen in that or\r\nsome other available form.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted on both sides, that all the elements of plant food are\r\nequally essential, and the controversy really lies in determining what\r\npractically limits the crop producible on any soil. The point at issue\r\nmay be put in a clear point of view by considering the course of events\r\non a soil altogether devoid of the elements of plants. If a small\r\nquantity of mineral matters be added to such a soil, it immediately\r\nbecomes capable of supporting a certain amount of vegetation, deriving\r\nfrom the air the organic elements necessary for this purpose, and with\r\nevery increase of the former, the air will be laid under a larger\r\ncontribution of the latter, to support the increased growth, and this\r\nmust proceed until the limit of supply from the atmosphere is reached.\r\nAt this point a further supply of mineral matters alone must obviously\r\nbe incapable of again increasing the crop, and it would thus be\r\nabsolutely necessary to conjoin them with a proportionate quantity of\r\norganic substances. Liebig maintains that this limit is never attained\r\nin practice, but that the air affords ammonia and the other organic\r\nelements in excess of the requirements of the largest crop, while\r\nmineral matters are generally though not invariably present in the soil\r\nin insufficient quantity. Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, on the other hand,\r\nbelieve that the soil generally contains an excess of mineral matters,\r\nand that a manure which is to bring out their full effect must contain\r\nammonia, or some other nitrogenous substance fitted to supplement the\r\ndeficient supply afforded by the atmosphere. In short, the question at\r\nissue is, whether there is or is not a sufficiency of atmospheric food\r\nto meet the demands of the largest crop which can practically be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAn absolutely conclusive reply to this question is by no means easy. The\r\nexperiments by which it is to be resolved are complicated by the fact,\r\nthat all soils capable of supporting anything like a crop, contain not\r\nonly the mineral, but the organic elements of its food in large and\r\ngenerally in greatly superabundant quantity, and it is impossible\r\nsatisfactorily to ascertain how much is derived from this source, and\r\nhow much from the atmosphere. There are in fact no experiments in which\r\nthe effects of a purely mineral soil have been ascertained. The\r\nimportant and carefully performed researches of Messrs. Lawes and\r\nGilbert were made upon a soil which had been long under cultivation, and\r\ncontained decaying vegetable matters in sufficient abundance to supply\r\nnitrogen to many successive crops, and it would be most unreasonable to\r\nassert that the produce they did obtain by means of mineral manures,\r\ndrew the whole of its nitrogen from the air. On the contrary, it may be\r\nfairly assumed that the soil did yield a certain quantity of its\r\nnitrogenous compounds, but to what extent this occurs, it is impossible\r\nto determine. This difficulty is encountered more or less in all the\r\nother experiments, and precludes absolute conclusions. The same fallacy\r\nalso besets the arguments of Liebig when he holds that the crop,\r\nincreased by means of mineral manures alone, must derive the whole of\r\nthe additional quantity of nitrogen which it contains from the air, as\r\nappears to be tacitly assumed throughout the whole discussion. So far\r\nfrom this being the case, it is just as likely that the mineral matters\r\nshould cause the plants to take it from the soil, if it is there, as\r\nfrom the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTaking a general view of the whole question, it is evident that a\r\ncertain amount of vegetation may always be produced by means of mineral\r\nmanures, and the quantity obtained is generally much beyond the normal\r\nproduce of the soil. But it is still open to doubt whether the largest\r\npossible crop can be thus obtained, although the balance of evidence is\r\nagainst it, and in favour of the addition of ammonia, and other\r\nnitrogenous and organic substances, to the soil. In actual practice\r\nmanures containing nitrogen are more important, and more extensively\r\napplied than any others, and the quantity of that element thus used is\r\nvery much larger than is generally supposed. Twenty tons of farm-yard\r\nmanure, a quantity commonly applied, and often exceeded on well\r\ncultivated land, contain a sufficiency of organic matters to yield about\r\n2-1/2 cwt. of nitrogen. A complete rotation, according to the six-course\r\nshift, contains almost exactly the same quantity of nitrogen, when we\r\nassume average crops throughout the whole, and it is thus made up.[K]\r\n\r\n                                     Lbs. of Nitrogen.\r\n1.

Wheat and straw as before                 45\r\n                                           ----\r\n                                    Total   274\r\n\r\nThe supply is therefore quite sufficient for the requirements of the\r\ncrop; and when it is borne in mind that a considerable quantity of\r\nammonia and nitric acid is annually carried down by the rain, and that\r\nduring a long rotation other substances are very generally used in\r\naddition to farm-yard manure, it is obvious that the crop need not\r\ndepend to any extent upon what it derives from the air. What is true of\r\nthe nitrogenous matters applies with still greater force to the mineral\r\nconstituents of the manure. Twenty tons of farm-yard manure contain 32\r\ncwt. of mineral matters, while the average crops of a six course-shift\r\ncontain only 1088 lbs., or less than one-third of this quantity. It is\r\nobvious, therefore, that in well manured land there must be a gradual\r\nincrease of all the constituents of plants, but that of the mineral\r\nmatters is relatively much greater than that of the nitrogenous. If\r\ntherefore from any cause the crop produced on a soil to which farm-yard\r\nmanure had been applied were greatly to exceed the average, the amount\r\nof produce, so far as the soil is concerned, would be limited not by\r\ndeficiency of mineral, but of nitrogenous food. Hence also when\r\nfarm-yard manure is liberally applied, there is a gradual accumulation\r\nof valuable matters, and a progressive improvement of the productive\r\ncapacity of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is far otherwise, however, if a special manure is employed, because\r\nin that case the crop is thrown upon the resources of the soil itself\r\nfor all its constituents except those contained in the substance\r\nemployed, and by persisting in its exclusive use exhaustion is the\r\ninevitable result. It would be wrong, however, to infer from this, that\r\nspecial manures are to be avoided. On the contrary, great benefits are\r\nderived from their judicious employment, and the circumstances under\r\nwhich they are admissible may be readily gathered from what has already\r\nbeen said. They are agents which bring into useful activity the dormant\r\nresources of the soil, they restore the proper balance between its\r\ndifferent constituents, and supply the excessive demand of some\r\nparticular elements. Thus, for instance, in a soil containing an\r\nabundant supply of mineral matters, a salt of ammonia or nitric acid\r\nincreases the crop, by promoting the absorption of the substances\r\nalready present. So likewise a soil on which young cattle and milch cows\r\nhave been long pastured has its fertility restored by phosphate of lime,\r\nbecause that substance is removed in the bones and milk in relatively\r\nmuch larger proportion than any others.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a special manure is necessarily dependent on a great\r\nvariety of circumstances, and is governed partly by the nature of the\r\nsoil, and partly by that of the crop. It is obvious that cases may occur\r\nin which any individual element of the plant may be deficient, and ought\r\nto be supplied, but experience has shown that, as a rule, nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid are the substances which it is most necessary to furnish\r\nin this way, and which in all but exceptional cases produce a marked\r\neffect on the crop. The other substances, such as potash, soda,\r\nmagnesia, etc., occasionally act beneficially, but the results obtained\r\nfrom them are very uncertain, and frequently entirely negative.\r\n\r\nIt has been commonly asserted that phosphates are specially adapted to\r\nroot crops, and ammonia or nitrates to the cereals, and this statement\r\nis so far true, that the former are used with advantage on the turnip,\r\nwhile the latter act with great benefit on grain crops and more\r\nespecially on oats and barley. The effect of the latter, however, is\r\nmore or less apparent in all crops and on all soils, because it promotes\r\nthe assimilation of the mineral matters already present. But its\r\npeculiar importance lies in the power which it has of promoting the\r\nrapid development of the young plant, causing it to send its roots out\r\ninto the soil, and to spread its leaves into the air, thus enabling it\r\nto take from those two sources, abundance of the useful substances\r\nexisting in them. But it ought to be distinctly understood, that the\r\nstatement that particular manures are specially suited to particular\r\ncrops must be assumed with some reservation, because everything depends\r\nupon the nature of the food contained in the soil. It is well known that\r\nthere are many soils in which ammonia acts more favourably on the turnip\r\nthan phosphates, and _vice versa_, and the difference is often due to\r\nthe previous treatment. In many cases in which ammonia when first used\r\nproved most beneficial, it now begins to lose its effect, and the reason\r\nno doubt is, that by its means the phosphates existing in these soils\r\nhave been reduced in amount, while the ammonia has accumulated, so that\r\na change in the system of manuring becomes necessary. A general manure\r\nmay be used year after year in a perfectly routine manner, but where a\r\nspecial manure is employed, the importance of watching its effects, and\r\naltering it as circumstances indicate, cannot be over-estimated. The\r\nlength of time during which special manures have been extensively used\r\nhas not been sufficient to bring this prominently before the\r\nagriculturist, but its importance must sooner or later force itself upon\r\nhim, and he will then see the necessity for studying the succession of\r\nmanures as well as that of crops.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered a manure merely as a source from which\r\nplants derive their food, but it exercises a scarcely less important\r\naction on the chemical and physical properties of the soil. Farm-yard\r\nmanure, which, as we shall afterwards see, contains a large amount of\r\ndecomposing vegetable and animal matters, yields a supply of carbonic\r\nacid, which operates on the mineral constituents, promotes their further\r\ndisintegration, and thus liberates their useful elements. It affects\r\nalso their physical properties, for it diminishes the tenacity of heavy\r\nclays; each straw as it decomposes forming a channel through which the\r\nroots of plants, air, and moisture can penetrate more readily than\r\nthrough the stiff clay itself. On the other hand, it diminishes the\r\nporosity of light sandy soils, causes them to retain moisture, and\r\ngenerally makes their texture more suitable to the plant. Special\r\nmanures probably act to some extent chemically on the soil, but the\r\nnature of the changes they produce is as yet imperfectly understood.\r\nSuperphosphates which are highly acid in all probability act powerfully\r\non the mineral substances, and common salt, which, though of little\r\nimportance to the plant, occasionally produces very striking effects,\r\nappears to exercise some decomposing action on the soil. It is\r\ndifficult, however, to trace the mode in which they operate on a\r\nsubstance of such complexity as the soil. Lime, as we shall afterwards\r\nsee, acts by promoting the decomposition of the vegetable matters on\r\nthe soil, and possibly some other substances may have a similar effect.\r\n\r\nIn the application of manures to the soil there are several\r\ncircumstances which must be taken into consideration. It is generally\r\nstated that they ought to be distributed as uniformly as possible, but\r\nthis is not always necessary nor even advisable, and certainly is not\r\nacted on in practice. Much must depend upon the nature both of crop and\r\nsoil. When the former throws out long and widely penetrating roots, the\r\nmore uniformly the manure is distributed the better; but if the rootlets\r\nare short, it is clearly more advisable that it should be deposited at\r\nno great distance from the seed. Practically this is observed in the\r\ncase of the potato and turnip, which are short rooted, and where the\r\nmanure is generally deposited close to the seed. But this course is\r\nnever adopted with the long rooted cereals, the manure being usually\r\napplied to the previous crop, so that the repeated ploughings to which\r\nthe soil is subjected in the interval may distribute what remains as\r\nwidely and uniformly as possible. In soils which are either excessively\r\ntenacious or light, the accumulation of the manure close to the plants\r\nhas also the effect of producing an artificial soil in their immediate\r\nneighbourhood, containing abundance of plant-food, and having physical\r\nproperties better fitted for the support of the plant. On the other\r\nhand, when a special manure is used alone, and with the view of\r\npromoting the assimilation of substances already existing in the soil,\r\nthe more uniform its distribution the better, because it is essential\r\nthat the roots which penetrate through it should find at every point\r\nthey reach not only the original soil constituents, but also the\r\nsubstances used to supplement their deficiencies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: The quantities here taken are the averages deduced from the\r\nagricultural statistics taken in Scotland some years since, with the\r\nexception of hay and straw, which are not included in them. I have\r\ntherefore assumed a reasonable quantity in these cases.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF FARM-YARD AND LIQUID MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, a general manure has been defined as one\r\ncontaining all the constituents of the crop to which it is to be\r\napplied, in a state fitted for assimilation. This condition is fulfilled\r\nonly by substances derived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms, and\r\nmost effectually by a mixture of both. On this account, and also because\r\nits properties are such as enable it to act powerfully on the soil,\r\nfarm-yard manure must always be of the highest importance. It is, in\r\nfact, the typical manure, and in proportion as other substances approach\r\nit in properties and composition, is their value for general purposes on\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nFarm-yard manure is a mixture of the dung and urine of domestic animals,\r\nwith the straw used as litter; and its value and composition must\r\nnecessarily depend upon that of these substances, as well as on the\r\nproportion in which they are mixed. The dung of animals consists of that\r\npart of their food which passes through the intestinal canal without\r\nundergoing assimilation; the urine containing the portion which has been\r\nassimilated and is again excreted, in consequence of the changes which\r\nare proceeding in the tissues of the animal. Their composition is\r\nnaturally very different, and must be separately considered.\r\n\r\n_Urine._--Urine consists of a variety of earthy and alkaline salts, and\r\nof certain organic substances, generally rich in nitrogen, dissolved in\r\na large quantity of water. That of the different domestic animals has\r\nbeen frequently examined, but the analyses of Fromberg give the most\r\ncomplete view of their manurial value:--\r\n\r\n                    Horse.

The first of these is found in\r\nconsiderable quantity in the urine of all animals, but is especially\r\nabundant in the carnivora. Uric acid is found only in these animals, and\r\nis the most remarkable constituent of the excrement of birds, serpents,\r\nand many of the lower animals. Hippuric acid is most abundant in the\r\nherbivora. These substances are all highly nitrogenous. They contain--\r\n\r\n                Urea.    Uric Acid.   Hippuric Acid.\r\nCarbon          20.00        36.0        60.7\r\nHydrogen         6.60         2.4         5.0\r\nNitrogen        46.70        33.4         8.0\r\nOxygen          26.70        28.2        26.3\r\n               ------       -----       -----\r\n               100.00       100.0       100.0\r\n\r\nThey are extremely prone to change, and in presence of animal matters\r\nreadily ferment, and are converted into salts of ammonia. Thus human\r\nurine, which, at the time of emission is free from smell of ammonia, and\r\nhas a slightly acid reaction, becomes highly ammoniacal if it be kept\r\nfor a few days. This is due to the conversion of urea into carbonate of\r\nammonia; and the same change takes place, though more slowly, with uric\r\nand hippuric acids.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, from the foregoing analyses, that great differences must\r\nexist in the manurial value of the urine of different animals. Not only\r\ndo they vary greatly in the proportion of solid matters which they\r\ncontain, but also in the kind and quantity of their nitrogenous\r\nconstituents. They differ also in regard to their saline ingredients;\r\nand while salts of potash and soda form the principal part of the ash of\r\nthe urine of the ox, sheep, goat, and horse, and phosphoric acid and\r\nphosphates are entirely absent, that of the pig contains a considerable\r\nquantity of the latter substances, and in this respect more nearly\r\nresembles the urine of man. Human urine is also much richer in urea and\r\nnitrogenous constituents generally, and has a higher value than any of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nIt is especially worthy of notice that the urine of the purely\r\nherbivorous animals (with the exception of the sheep, which contains a\r\nsmall quantity), are devoid of phosphates and urea; and consequently,\r\nwhen employed alone, they are not general manures--a matter of some\r\nimportance in relation to the subject of liquid manuring, which will be\r\nafterwards discussed.\r\n\r\n_Dung._--The solid excrement of animals is equally variable in\r\ncomposition. That of the domestic animals which had the ordinary winter\r\nfood was found to have the following composition:--\r\n\r\n                                Horse.  Cow.  Sheep.

Salts of potash, for\r\nexample, form nine-tenths of the inorganic part of the urine of the ox,\r\nwhile less than three per cent of that alkali is found in its dung.\r\nPhosphoric acid, on the other hand, is not met with in the urine, but\r\nforms about ten per cent of the dung. Silica is the most abundant\r\nconstituent of the dung, but a large proportion of that found on\r\nanalysis has been swallowed in the shape of grains of sand and particles\r\nof soil mechanically mixed with the food, although part is also derived\r\nfrom the straw and grains, which contain that substance in great\r\nabundance. The difference in the quantity of nitrogen they contain is\r\nalso very marked, and is distinctly shown by the following analyses by\r\nBoussingault, which give the quantity of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,\r\noxygen, and ash in the dung and urine of the horse and the cow in their\r\nnatural state, and after drying at 212 deg..\r\n\r\n+---------+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|         |           HORSE.         |            COW.          |\r\n|         +-------------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n|         |   Natural.  |     Dry.   |   Natural.  |     Dry.   |\r\n|         +-------------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n|         |Urine.| Dung.|Urine.|Dung.|Urine.| Dung.|Urine.|Dung.|\r\n|         +------+------+------+-----+------+------+------+-----+\r\n|Carbon   |  4.46|  9.56|  36.0| 38.7|  3.18|  4.02|  27.2| 42.8|\r\n|Hydrogen |  0.47|  1.26|   3.8|  5.1|  0.30|  0.49|   2.6|  5.2|\r\n|Nitrogen |  1.55|  0.54|  12.5|  2.2|  0.44|  0.22|   3.8|  2.3|\r\n|Oxygen   |  1.40|  9.31|  11.3| 37.7|  3.09|  3.54|  26.4| 37.7|\r\n|Ash      |  4.51|  4.02|  36.4| 16.3|  4.68|  1.13|  40.0| 12.0|\r\n|Water    | 87.61| 75.31|   0.0|  0.0| 88.31| 90.60|   0.0|  0.0|\r\n|         +------+------+------+-----+------+------+------+-----+\r\n|         |100.00|100.00| 100.0|100.0|100.00|100.00| 100.0|100.0|\r\n+---------+------+------+------+-----+------+------+------+-----+\r\n\r\nHence, weight for weight, the urine of the horse, in its natural state,\r\ncontains three times as much nitrogen as its dung; that of the cow twice\r\nas much; and the difference, especially in the horse, is still more\r\nconspicuous when they are dry.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the quality of farm-yard manure must depend--1. On\r\nthe kind of animal from which it is produced; 2. On the quantity of\r\nstraw which has been used as litter; 3. On the nature of the food with\r\nwhich the animals have been supplied; 4. On the extent to which its\r\nvaluable constituents have been rendered available by the treatment to\r\nwhich it has been subjected; and 5. On the care which has been taken to\r\nprevent the escape of the urine, or of the ammonia produced by its\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe composition of farm-yard manure has engaged the attention of several\r\nchemists; but there are still many points on which our information\r\nregarding it is less complete than might be desired. Its investigation\r\nis surrounded with peculiar difficulties, not merely on account of its\r\ncomplexity, but because its properties render it exceedingly difficult\r\nto obtain a sample which fairly represents its average composition. In\r\nthe case of long dung, these difficulties are so great that it is\r\nscarcely possible to overcome them; and hence, discrepancies are\r\noccasionally to be met with in the analyses of the most careful\r\nexperimenters. The most minute and careful analyses yet made are those\r\nof Voelcker, who has compared the composition of fresh and rotten dung,\r\nand studied the changes which the former undergoes when preserved in\r\ndifferent ways. He employed in his experiments both fresh and rotten\r\ndung, and subjected them to different methods of treatment. His analyses\r\nare given in the accompanying table, in which column 1 gives the\r\ncomposition of fresh long dung, composed of cow and pig dung. 2. Is dung\r\nof the same kind, after having lain in a heap against a wall, but\r\notherwise unprotected from the weather for three months and eleven days\r\nin winter, during which time little rain fell. 3. The same manure, kept\r\nfor the same time under a shed. 4. Well rotten dung, which had been kept\r\nin the manure heap upwards of six months. 5. The same, after having lain\r\nagainst a wall for two months and nine days longer.\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n|

the\r\ndifferences are by no means great, although, on the whole, they tend to\r\nshow that, weight for weight, well-rotten dung is superior to fresh,\r\nprovided it has been properly treated. Not only is the quantity of\r\nvaluable matters existing in the soluble state materially increased,\r\nwhereby the dung is enabled to act with greater rapidity, but, owing to\r\nevaporation and the escape of carbonic acid, produced by the\r\ndecomposition of the organic substances, the proportion of those\r\nconstituents which are most important to the plant is increased. This is\r\nparticularly to be noticed, in regard to the nitrogen, which has\r\ndistinctly increased in all cases in which the dung has been kept for\r\nsome time; and the practical importance of this observation is very\r\ngreat, because it has been commonly supposed that, during the process of\r\nfermentation, ammonia is liable to escape into the air. It would appear,\r\nhowever, that there is but little risk of loss in this way, so long as\r\nthe dung-heap is left undisturbed; and it is only when it is turned that\r\nany appreciable quantity of ammonia volatilizes. It is different,\r\nhowever, with the action of rain, which soon removes, by solution, a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the nitrogen contained in farm-yard manure; and\r\nthe deterioration must necessarily be most conspicuous in rotten dung,\r\nwhich sometimes contains nearly half of its nitrogen in a soluble\r\ncondition. The effect produced in this way is conspicuously seen, by the\r\nresults of weighings and analyses of small experimental dung-heaps, made\r\nby Dr. Voelcker at different periods. The subjoined table shows the\r\ncomposition of the heap, lying against a wall, and exposed to the\r\nweather at different periods:--\r\n\r\n+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\r\n|                          |           WHEN PUT UP.                    |\r\n|                          +---------+------------+---------+----------+\r\n|                          | Nov 3d  | April 30th | Aug 23d | Nov 15th |\r\n|                          | 1854.   | 1855.      | 1855.   | 1855.    |\r\n|                          +---------+------------+---------+----------+\r\n| Weight of manure in lbs. |  2838   |   2026     |  1994   |  1974    |\r\n|                          +---------+------------+---------+----------+\r\n| Water                    | 1877.9  | 1336.1     | 1505.3  | 1466.5   |\r\n| Dry Matter               |  960.1  |  689.9     |  488.7  |  507.5   |\r\n|                          +---------+------------+---------+----------|\r\n|   Consisting of--        |         |            |         |          |\r\n| Soluble organic matter   |   70.38 |   86.51    |   58.83 |   54.04  |\r\n|   \"    mineral matter    |   43.71 |   57.88    |   39.16 |   36.89  |\r\n| Insoluble organic matter |  731.07 |  389.74    |  243.22 |  214.92  |\r\n|   \"     mineral matter   |  114.94 |  155.77    |  147.49 |  201.07  |\r\n|                          +---------+------------+---------+----------+\r\n| Total nitrogen           |   18.23 |   18.14    |   13.14 |   13.03  |\r\n| Equal to ammonia         |   22.14 |   22.02    |   15.96 |   15.75  |\r\n+--------------------------+---------+------------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\nIn this case, during the winter six months, which were very dry, the\r\nmanure lost 541.8 lbs. of water and 270.2 lbs. of dry matter, but the\r\nnitrogen remained completely unchanged.

The total weight of the manure, however, undergoes\r\na very great reduction, due chiefly to evaporation of water, but in part\r\nalso to the loss of organic matters evolved in the form of carbonic acid\r\nduring fermentation.\r\n\r\nWhen the manure is spread out, as it is usually found under cattle in\r\nopen yards, the deterioration is very great, a quantity thus treated\r\nhaving lost, in the course of a year, nearly two-thirds of its nitrogen,\r\nand four-fifths of its soluble inorganic matters.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion deducible from these analyses is that, provided\r\nit be carefully prepared, farm-yard manure does not differ very largely\r\nin value, although the balance is in favour of the well-rotten dung.\r\nThis result is in accordance with that obtained by other experimenters,\r\nwho have generally found from 0.5 to 0.6 per cent of nitrogen, and 1 or\r\n2 per cent of phosphates. But when carelessly managed, it may fall\r\ngreatly short of this standard, as is particularly seen in a sample\r\nexamined by Cameron, which had been so effectually washed out by the\r\nrain, as to retain only 0.15 per cent of ammonia. These cases, however,\r\nare exceptional, and well made and well preserved farm-yard manure will\r\ngenerally be found to differ comparatively little in value; and when\r\nbought at the ordinary price, the purchaser, as we shall afterwards more\r\nparticularly see, is pretty sure to get full value for his money, and\r\nthe specialities of its management are of comparatively little moment to\r\nhim. But the case is very different when the person who uses the manure\r\nhas also to manufacture it. The experiments already quoted have shown\r\nthat, though the manure made in the ordinary manner may, weight for\r\nweight, be as valuable as at first, the loss during the period of its\r\npreservation is usually very large, and it becomes extremely important\r\nto determine the mode in which it may be reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\nIn the production of farm-yard manure of the highest quality, the object\r\nto be held in view is to retain, as effectually as possible, all the\r\nvaluable constituents of the dung and urine. But in considering the\r\nquestion here, it will be sufficient to refer exclusively to its\r\nnitrogen, both because it is the most important, and also because the\r\ncircumstances which favour its preservation are most advantageous to the\r\nother constituents. In the management of the dung-heap, there are three\r\nthings to be kept in view:--First, To obtain a manure containing the\r\nlargest possible amount of nitrogen; secondly, To convert that nitrogen\r\nmore or less completely into ammonia; and thirdly, To retain it\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nAs far as the first of these points is concerned, it must be obvious\r\nthat much will depend on the nature and quantity of the food with which\r\nthe animals yielding the dung are supplied, and the period of the\r\nfattening process at which it is collected. When lean beasts are put up\r\nto feed, they at first exhaust the food much more completely than they\r\ndo when they are nearly fattened, and the manure produced is very\r\ninferior at first, and goes on gradually improving in quality as the\r\nanimal becomes fat.\r\n\r\nWhen the food is rich in nitrogenous compounds, the value of the manure\r\nis considerably increased. It has been ascertained, for instance, that\r\nwhen oil-cake has been used, not less than seven-eighths of the valuable\r\nmatters contained in it reappear in the excrements; and as that\r\nsubstance is highly nitrogenous, the dung ought, weight for weight, to\r\ncontain a larger amount of that element. That it actually does so, I\r\nsatisfied myself by experiments, made some years since, when the dung\r\nand urine of animals fed on turnips, with and without oil-cake, were\r\nexamined; but unfortunately, no determination of the total quantity of\r\nthe excretions could be made, so that it was impossible to estimate the\r\nincreased value. It has been commonly supposed that when cattle are fed\r\nwith oil-cake, the increased value of the manure is equal to from\r\none-half to two-thirds the price of the oil-cake; but this is a rather\r\nexaggerated estimate as regards linseed-cake, although it falls short of\r\nthe truth in the case of rape, as we shall afterwards more particularly\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be possible, in this way, to increase the quantity of\r\nnitrogen as a manure, there is a limit to its accumulation, due to the\r\nfact, that it is contained most abundantly in the urine, which can only\r\nbe retained by the use of a sufficient supply of litter. Where that is\r\ndeficient, the dung-heap becomes too moist, and the fluid and most\r\nvaluable part drains off, either to be lost, or to be collected in the\r\nliquid manure-tank. In the well managed manure-heap, the quantity of\r\nlitter should be sufficient to retain the greater part of the liquid\r\nmanure, and to admit of only a small quantity draining from it, which\r\nshould be pumped up at intervals, so as to keep the whole in a proper\r\nstate of moisture. Attention to this point is of great moment, and\r\nmaterially affects the fermentation. When it is too moist or too dry,\r\nthat process is equally checked; in the former case by the exclusion of\r\nair, which is essential to it; and in the latter, by the want of water,\r\nwithout which the air cannot act. The exact mode in which the manure is\r\nto be managed must greatly depend on whether the supply of litter is\r\nlarge or small. In the latter case the urine escapes, and is collected\r\nin the liquid manure-tank, and must be used by irrigation, and in some\r\ncases this mode of application has advantages, but in general, it is\r\npreferable to avoid it, and have recourse to substances which increase\r\nthe bulk of the heap sufficiently to make it retain the whole of the\r\nliquid. For this purpose, clay, or still better, the vegetable refuse of\r\nthe farm, such as weeds, ditch cleanings, leaves, and, in short, any\r\nporous matters, may be used. But by far the best substance, when it can\r\nbe obtained, is dry peat, which not only absorbs the fluid, but fixes\r\nthe ammonia, by converting it more or less completely into humate.\r\nReference has been already made to the absorbent power of peat in the\r\nsection on soils, but it may be mentioned here that accurate experiment\r\nhas shown that a good peat will absorb about 2 per cent[L] of ammonia,\r\nand when dry will still retain from 1 to 1.5 per cent, or nearly twice\r\nas much as would be yielded by the whole nitrogen of an equal weight of\r\nfarm-yard manure. Peat charcoal has been recommended for the same\r\npurpose, but careful experiment has shown that it _does not absorb\r\nammonia_, although it removes putrid odour; and though it may be\r\nusefully employed when it is wished to deodorize the manure heap, it\r\nmust not be trusted to for fixing the ammonia.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has frequently been laid on the advantage to be derived from\r\nthe use of substances capable of combining chemically with the ammonia\r\nproduced during the fermentation of dung and gypsum, sulphate of iron,\r\nchloride of manganese, sulphate of magnesia, and sulphuric acid, have\r\nbeen proposed for this purpose, and have been used occasionally, though\r\nnot extensively. They all answer the purpose of _fixing_ the ammonia,\r\nthat is, of preventing its escaping into the air; but the risk of loss\r\nin this way appears to have been much exaggerated, for a delicate\r\ntest-paper, held over a manure-heap, is not affected; and during\r\nfermentation, humic acid is produced in such abundance, as to combine\r\nwith the greater part of the ammonia. The real source of deterioration\r\nis the escape of the soluble matters in the drainings from the\r\nmanure-heap, which is not prevented by any of these substances; and\r\nwhere no means are taken to preserve or retain this portion, the loss is\r\nextremely large, and amounts, under ordinary circumstances, to from a\r\nthird to a half of the whole value of the manure. Manure, therefore,\r\ncannot be exposed to the weather without losing a proportion of its\r\nvaluable matters, depending upon the quantity of rain which falls upon\r\nit. Hence it is obvious that great advantage must be derived, especially\r\nin rainy districts, from covered manure-pits. This plan has been\r\nintroduced on some farms with good effect; but the expense and doubts\r\nas to the benefits derived from it, have hitherto prevented the practice\r\nbecoming general. The principal difficulty experienced in the use of the\r\ncovered dung-pit is, that, where the litter is abundant, the urine does\r\nnot supply a sufficiency of moisture to promote the active fermentation\r\nof the dung, and it becomes necessary to pump water over it at\r\nintervals; but when this is properly done, the quality of the manure is\r\nexcellent, and its valuable matters are most thoroughly economized.\r\n\r\nAlthough covered dung-pits have been but little used, their benefits\r\nhave been indirectly obtained by the method of box-feeding, one of the\r\ngreat advantages of which is held to be the production of a manure of\r\nsuperior quality to that obtained in the old way. In box-feeding none of\r\nthe dung or urine is removed from under the animals, but is trampled\r\ndown by their feet, and new quantities of litter being constantly added,\r\nthe whole is consolidated into a compact mass, by which the urine is\r\nentirely retained. Whatever objection may be taken to this system, so\r\nfar as the health of the animals is concerned, there is no doubt as to\r\nthe complete economy of the manure, provided the quantity of litter used\r\nbe sufficient to retain the whole of the liquid. But its advantage is\r\nentirely dependent on the possibility of fulfilling this condition.\r\n\r\nWhether box manure is really superior to that which can be prepared by\r\nthe ordinary method is very questionable, but it undoubtedly surpasses a\r\nlarge proportion of that actually produced. It is more than probable,\r\nhowever, that the careful management of the manure-heap would yield an\r\nequally good product. It is manifest that the same number of cattle, fed\r\nin the same way, on the same food, and supplied with the same quantity\r\nof litter, must always excrete the same quantities of valuable matters;\r\nand the only question to be solved is, whether they are more effectually\r\npreserved in the one way than the other? It will be readily seen that\r\nthis cannot be done by analysis alone, but that it is necessary to\r\nconjoin with it a determination of the total weight of manure produced;\r\nfor though, weight for weight, box manure may be better than ordinary\r\nfarm-yard manure, the total quantity obtained by the latter method, from\r\na given number of cattle, may be so much greater, that the deficiency in\r\nquality may be compensated for. At the present time our knowledge is too\r\nlimited to admit of a definite opinion on this subject, but it is highly\r\ndeserving of the combined investigation of the farmer and the chemist.\r\n\r\nSupposing the conditions which produce the manure containing the largest\r\nquantity of nitrogen to have been fulfilled, we have now to consider\r\nthose which affect its evolution in the form of ammonia. This change is\r\neffected by _fermentation_. When a quantity of manure is left to itself\r\nit becomes hot, and gradually diminishes in bulk, and if it be turned\r\nover after some time, the smell of ammonia may be more or less\r\ndistinctly observed. This ammonia is produced, in the first instance,\r\nfrom the urine, the nitrogenous constituents of which are rapidly\r\ndecomposed, and the fermentation thus set up in the mass of manure\r\nextends first to the solid dung, and then to the straw of the litter,\r\nand gradually proceeds until a large quantity of ammonia is produced.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh manure is deposited in the soil, the same changes occur, but\r\nthey then proceed more slowly, and experience has shown that a much\r\nsmaller effect is produced on the crop to which it has been applied than\r\nwhen it has been well fermented in the heap. This effect is consistent\r\nwith theory, which would further indicate that well-fermented dung must\r\nbe especially advantageous when applied to quick-growing crops, and less\r\nnecessary to those which come slowly to maturity. As a rule, well\r\nfermented manure is to be preferred, provided it has been well managed\r\nand carefully prepared; but when this has not been done, and the manure\r\nhas been exposed to the weather, or made in open courts or hammels, the\r\neconomic advantages are all on the side of the fresh dung. It may be\r\nquestioned also whether, now that there are so many other available\r\nsources of ammonia, it may not in many instances be advantageous to use\r\nthe dung fresh, conjoined with a sufficient quantity of some salt of\r\nammonia, or other substance fitted to supply the quantity of that\r\nelement necessary for the requirements of the crop.\r\n\r\nAfter the farm-yard manure has been prepared at the homestead, it is\r\noften necessary to cart it out to the field some time before it is to be\r\napplied, and it is a question of some importance to determine how it may\r\nbe best preserved there. The general practice is to store it in heaps in\r\nthe corners of the fields, but some difference of opinion exists as to\r\nwhether it should be lightly thrown up so as to leave it in a porous\r\nstate, and so promote its further fermentation, or whether it should be\r\nconsolidated as much as possible by driving the carts on to the top of\r\nthe heap during its construction. Considering the risks to which the\r\nmanure is exposed on the field, the latter plan would appear to be the\r\nbest. It is advisable also to interstratify the dung with dry soil, so\r\nas to absorb any liquid which may tend to escape from it, and it should\r\nalso be covered with a well-beaten layer of earth, in order to exclude\r\nthe rain. Although these precautions must not be omitted if the manure\r\nis to be stored in heaps, it will probably be often found quite as\r\nadvantageous to spread it at once, and leave it lying on the surface\r\nuntil it is convenient to plough it. The loss of ammonia by\r\nvolatilization will, under such circumstances, especially in the cold\r\nseason of the year, be very trifling, and the rain which falls will only\r\nserve to incorporate the soluble matters with the soil, where they will\r\nbe retained by its absorptive power.\r\n\r\nIn the actual application of the manure to the crop, several points\r\nrequire consideration. It is especially important to determine whether\r\nit ought to be uniformly distributed through the soil, or be kept near\r\nthe roots of the plants. Both systems have their advocates, and each has\r\nadvantages in particular cases. The choice between the two must greatly\r\ndepend upon the nature of the crop and the soil. When the former is of a\r\nkind which spreads its roots wide and deep through the soil, the more\r\nuniformly the manure can be distributed the better; but when it is used\r\nwith plants whose roots do not travel far, it is more advantageous to\r\naccumulate it near the seeds. Obvious advantages also attend this\r\npractice in soils which are either too heavy or too light. When, for\r\nexample, it is necessary to cultivate turnips in a heavy clay, the\r\nmanure put into the drills produces a kind of artificial soil in the\r\nneighbourhood of the plants, in which the bulbs expand more readily than\r\nin the clay itself. On the other hand, when a large quantity of dung, in\r\na state of active fermentation, comes into immediate contact with the\r\nroots, its effect is not unfrequently injurious. These and many other\r\npoints, which will readily suggest themselves to any one who studies the\r\ncomposition and properties of farm-yard manure, belong more strictly to\r\nthe subject of practical agriculture, and need not be enlarged on here.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of agriculture, a proper estimate of the money\r\nvalue of farm-yard manure is of much importance in an economic point of\r\nview, and many matters connected with the profitable management of a\r\nfarm must hinge upon it. If an estimate be made upon the principle which\r\nwill be explained when we come to treat of artificial manures, it\r\nappears that fresh farm-yard manure of good quality is worth from 12s.\r\nto 15s. per ton, and well-rotted dung rather more. It is questionable,\r\nhowever, whether the system of valuation which is accurate in the case\r\nof a guano or other rapidly acting substance, is applicable to farm-yard\r\nmanure, the effects of which extend over some years. A deduction must be\r\nmade for the years during which the manure remains unproductive, and\r\nalso for the additional expense incurred in carting and distributing a\r\nsubstance so much more bulky than the so-called portable manures, and it\r\nwould not be safe to estimate its value at more than 7s. or 8s. per ton.\r\n\r\n_Liquid Manure._--This term is applied to the urine of the animals fed\r\non the farm, and to the drainings from the manure-heap, which, in place\r\nof being returned to it, are allowed to flow away, and collected in\r\ntanks, from which they are distributed by a watering-cart, or according\r\nto the method recently introduced in Ayrshire, and since adopted in\r\nother places, by pipes laid under-ground in the fields, and through\r\nwhich the manure is either pumped by steam-power, or, where the\r\nnecessary inclination can be obtained, is distributed by gravitation.\r\nThat liquid manure must necessarily be valuable, is an inference which\r\nmaybe at once drawn from the analyses of the urine of different animals\r\nalready given, and of which it chiefly consists. In addition to the\r\nurine, however, it contains also the soluble organic and mineral matters\r\nof the dung, as well as a quantity of solid matters in suspension, among\r\nwhich phosphates are found, and thus it possesses a supply of an\r\nelement which would be almost entirely deficient if it were composed of\r\nurine alone.

All of them are\r\nparticularly rich in potash, and contain but a small proportion of\r\nphosphoric acid. The general inference to be deduced from them is, that\r\nliquid manure is a most important source of the alkalis and ammonia, and\r\nmust be peculiarly valuable on soils in which these substances are\r\ndeficient.\r\n\r\nThe system of liquid manuring, originally introduced by Mr. Kennedy of\r\nMyremill, Ayrshire, and which has since been adopted in some other\r\nplaces, differs from liquid manuring in its _strict_ sense, for not only\r\nare the drainings of the manure-heap employed, but the whole solid\r\nexcrements are mixed with water in a tank, and rape-dust and other\r\nsubstances occasionally added, and distributed through the pipes.\r\n\r\nIt has been abandoned on Mr. Kennedy's farm, but is in use at Tiptree\r\nHall, and on the farm of Mr. Ralston, Lagg, where the fluid is\r\ndistributed by gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements employed by Mr. Mechi are identical with those formerly\r\nin use at Myremill. The greater part of the stock is kept on boards, and\r\nthe liquid and solid excrements are collected together in the tank, and\r\nlargely diluted before distribution. The liquid from the tanks has been\r\nrecently examined by Dr. Voelcker, who found it to contain per gallon--\r\n\r\nOrganic matter and ammoniacal salts       53.03\r\nSoluble silica                             6.47\r\nInsoluble siliceous matter (clay)         15.17\r\nOxide of iron and alumina                  2.36\r\nLime                                       6.60\r\nMagnesia                                   1.73\r\n                                          -----\r\nPotash                                     0.35\r\nChloride of potassium                      1.95\r\nChloride of sodium                         4.81\r\nPhosphoric acid                            3.72\r\nSulphuric acid                             1.94\r\nCarbonic acid, and loss                    0.47\r\n                                          -----\r\n     Total solids                         96.60\r\nAmmonia                                    8.10\r\n\r\nThe quantity of this liquid distributed per acre is about 50,000\r\ngallons, at a cost of 2d. per gallon. As this quantity contains about 39\r\nlbs. of ammonia, it must be nearly equivalent to 2 cwt. of Peruvian\r\nguano, which costs, with the expense of spreading, from 28s. to 30s. per\r\nacre, while the cost of distributing the liquid exceeds L1: 17s. per\r\nacre. On the other hand, the rapidity with which liquid manure produces\r\nits effect must be taken into account. It is on this that its chief\r\nvalue depends, and especially when applied to grass land in early\r\nspring, it produces an abundant crop just when turnips and other winter\r\nfood are exhausted. Mr. Telfer, Cunning Park, who has used this system\r\nfor a good many years, has come to the conclusion that it is only in\r\nthis way that it can be made profitable; and though pipes are laid all\r\nover his farm, he has latterly restricted the use of the liquid manure\r\nentirely to Italian ryegrass. Its effect on the cereals is much less\r\nmarked, and it can scarcely be considered as capable of advantageous\r\napplication to the general operations of the farm. Neither can liquid\r\nmanure be applied to all soils. It fails entirely on heavy clays, but is\r\npeculiarly adapted to light sandy soils; and even barren sand may by its\r\nrepeated application, be made to yield luxuriant crops. It is not likely\r\nthat the system of liquid manuring will extend, except in localities\r\nwhere it is possible to distribute it by gravitation; and even then, it\r\nwill probably be found most economical to restrict its use to one\r\nportion of the farm; and for that purpose, the poorest and most sandy\r\nsoil ought to be selected.\r\n\r\n_Sewage Manure._--The use of the sewage of towns as a manure is closely\r\nconnected with that of the liquid manure produced on the farm. Its\r\napplication must take place in a similar manner, and be governed by the\r\nsame principles. Although numerous attempts have been made to convert it\r\ninto a solid form, or to precipitate its valuable matter, none of them\r\nhave succeeded; nor can it be expected that any plan can be devised for\r\nthe purpose, because the most important manurial constituents are\r\nchiefly soluble, and cannot be converted into an insoluble state, or\r\nprecipitated from their solution. In its liquid form, however, sewage\r\nmanure has been employed with the best possible effect in the\r\ncultivation of meadows. The most important instance of its application\r\nis in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where 325 acres receive the sewage\r\nof nearly half the town, and have been converted from barren sand into\r\nland which yields from L20 to L30 per acre. The contents of the sewer,\r\ntaken just before it flows into the first irrigated meadow, near\r\nLochend, were found to contain per gallon--\r\n\r\nSoluble organic matter              21.90\r\nInsoluble organic matter            21.70\r\nPeroxide of iron and alumina         2.01\r\nLime                                10.50\r\nMagnesia                             2.00\r\nSulphuric acid                       6.09\r\nPhosphoric acid                      6.14\r\n                                    -----\r\nChlorine                            12.20\r\nPotash                               2.89\r\nSoda                                13.27\r\nSilica                               6.50\r\n                                   ------\r\n                                   105.20\r\nAmmonia                             14.90\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that this sewage is superior in every\r\nrespect to the liquid manure used at Tiptree Hall; and the good effects\r\nobtained from its application, in the large quantities in which it is\r\nused in the Craigentinny meadows, may be well imagined. It operates, not\r\nmerely by the substances which it holds in solution, but also by\r\ndepositing a large quantity of matters carried along in suspension, and\r\nis in reality warping with a substance greatly superior to river-mud. A\r\ndeposit collected in a tank, where the sewage passes through a farm, is\r\nused as a manure, and contains--\r\n\r\nPeroxide of iron and alumina             4.45\r\nLime                                     1.74\r\nMagnesia                                 0.39\r\nPotash                                   0.10\r\nSoda                                     0.06\r\nPhosphoric acid                          1.08\r\nSulphuric acid                           0.16\r\nOrganic matter                          17.95\r\nSand                                    20.51\r\nWater                                   53.56\r\n                                       ------\r\n                                       100.00\r\nAmmonia                                  0.93\r\n\r\nAnd even, though containing more than half its weight of water and 20\r\nper cent of sand, this substance has considerable value as a manure.\r\n\r\nThe growing evils of the existing system of sewage, and the enormous\r\nwaste of a manurial matter, which the experience of the Craigentinny\r\nmeadows has shewn to be productive of the most important effects, has\r\nrecently directed much attention to the conversion of the contents of\r\nour sewers into a useful manure. Numerous plans for its precipitation\r\nand conversion into a solid manure have been proposed, but most of these\r\nhave shewn an entire ignorance of the fundamental principles of\r\nchemistry, and the best only succeed in precipitating a very small\r\nproportion of its valuable matters, and leave almost the whole of the\r\nammonia, as well as the greater part of the fixed alkalies, in solution.\r\nNor is it to be expected that any process will be discovered by which\r\nthese substances can be precipitated, because solubility is the special\r\ncharacteristic of their compounds, and no means is known by which it is\r\npossible to convert them into an insoluble form. If sewage is to be used\r\nat all, there seems little doubt that it must be by applying it entire,\r\nand in the liquid state. But here again, the expense of conveying it on\r\nto the land becomes an obstacle which it must frequently be impossible\r\nto overcome. When it can be conveyed by gravitation, as is the case in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Edinburgh, it may undoubtedly be used with the\r\nutmost advantage, and with the very best economic results. But when it\r\nrequires to be carried to a great distance through pipes, and raised to\r\na high level by pumping, all these advantages disappear. If the cost of\r\napplication amounts to 2d. a gallon, as in Mr. Mechi's case, or even to\r\nhalf that sum, it may be fairly concluded that it cannot be used with\r\nany great prospect of large economic results, and that, unless under\r\nvery exceptional cases, it must be unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe chances of success must also greatly depend upon the kind of soil on\r\nwhich it is used. Experience has shewn that its effects are most\r\nbeneficial on light and deep sandy soils, but that on heavy retentive\r\nclays it is without effect, or even absolutely injurious. In clay soils\r\nit is important to use every means of getting rid of moisture, and any\r\nplan which adds 200 or 300 tons of water to them, only aggravates their\r\nnatural defects to an extent which more than counterbalances the\r\nbenefits derived from the manurial matter it contains. Whatever the\r\nultimate result of the use of town sewage in the liquid form may be, it\r\nis unlikely that it will be employed in general agricultural practice.\r\nIt is more probable that it will be found necessary to set apart a\r\ncertain breadth of land to be treated by it exclusively. Many plans have\r\nbeen proposed for conveying it through considerable districts, and\r\nselling to the surrounding farmers the quantities which they require,\r\nbut wherever large sewage-works are established, it will be impossible\r\nto depend on a precarious demand, and the promoters of such schemes will\r\nbe compelled, as part of their speculation, to supply not only the\r\nmanure, but the land on which it is to be used. Indeed, the difficulties\r\nattending the whole question are so formidable, that even those who are\r\nmost anxious to see a stop put to the waste of manurial matter must\r\nadmit that the prospect of a successful economic result is not\r\nencouraging. Nor is it likely that anything will be done until the whole\r\nsystem of managing town refuse is changed, and in place of deluging it\r\nwith water, some plan can be contrived which, while fulfilling sanatory\r\nrequirements, shall preserve it in a concentrated form, or convert it\r\ninto a dry and inodorous substance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Report on the economic uses of peat. Highland Society's\r\nTransactions, N.S., vol. iv. p. 549.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF VEGETABLE MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany vegetable substances have been employed as manures, either alone or\r\nas auxiliaries to farm-yard manure. Like that substance, they are\r\ngeneral manures, and contain all the constituents of ordinary crops;\r\nbut, owing to the absence of animal matter, they in general undergo\r\ndecomposition and fermentation much more slowly, although some of them\r\ncontain a so largely preponderating proportion of nitrogen, that they\r\nmay in some respects be compared to the strictly nitrogenous manures.\r\n\r\n_Rape-dust, Mustard, Cotton and Castor Cake._--Rape-dust has long been\r\nemployed as a manure, and the success which has attended its use has led\r\nto the introduction of the refuse cake from some other oil seeds, such\r\nas those of mustard and castor-oil, which cannot be employed for\r\nfeeding. Like the seeds of all plants, these substances are rich in\r\nnitrogen, and their ash, containing of course all the constituents of\r\nthe plant, supplies the necessary inorganic elements. The following are\r\nanalyses of these substances, which, in addition to the amount of\r\nnitrogen and phosphates, shew also that of water and oil, to which\r\nreference will be made in a future chapter, in relation to the feeding\r\nvalue of some of them. The detailed composition of their ash may be\r\njudged of from that of the seeds from which they are made, and which\r\nhave been given under that head.\r\n\r\n+--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\r\n|                    | Rape-Cake. | Poppy-Cake. | Cotton-seed | Castor- |\r\n|                    |            |             |   Cake.     | Cake.   |\r\n|                    +------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\r\n| Water              |  10.68     |   11.63     |   11.19     |   12.31 |\r\n| Oil                |  11.10     |    5.95     |    9.08     |   24.32 |\r\n| Albuminious      } |  29.53     |   31.16     |   25.16     |   21.91 |\r\n|    compounds     } |            |             |             |         |\r\n| Ash                |   7.79     |   12.98     |    5.64     |    6.08 |\r\n| Other constituents |  40.90     |   38.18     |   48.93     |   35.38 |\r\n|                    +------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\r\n|                    | 100.00     |  100.00     |  100.00     |  100.00 |\r\n| Nitrogen           |   4.38     |    4.94     |    3.95     |    3.20 |\r\n| Silica             |   1.18     |    3.36     |    1.32     |    1.96 |\r\n| Phosphates         |   3.87     |   69.3      |    2.19     |    2.81 |\r\n| Phosphoric acid  } |            |             |             |         |\r\n|  in combination  } |   0.39     |    3.27     |    0.15     |    0.64 |\r\n|  with alkalies   } |            |             |             |         |\r\n+--------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\r\n\r\nA general similarity may be observed in the composition of all these\r\nsubstances; they are rich in nitrogen, and contain as much of that\r\nelement as is found in six or seven times their weight of farm-yard\r\nmanure, and a somewhat similar proportion exists in the amount of\r\nphosphates, and probably of their other constituents. They have all been\r\nemployed with success, but the most accurate observations have been made\r\nwith rape-dust, which has been longer and more extensively used than any\r\nof the others. It has been employed alone for turnips, or mixed with\r\nfarm-yard manure, and also as a top-dressing to cereals. But the most\r\nmarked advantage is derived from it when applied in the latter way on\r\nland which has been much exhausted, and its effects are then very\r\nstriking. An adequate supply of moisture is essential to the production\r\nof its full effects, and hence it often proves a failure in very dry\r\nseasons, and on dry soils. It must not be applied in too great\r\nabundance, experience having shewn that after a certain point has been\r\nreached, an increase in the quantity produces no benefit, and even\r\nsometimes positively diminishes the crop. The other substances of the\r\nsame class, in all probability, act in the same way, but as their\r\nintroduction is recent, and their use limited, less is known regarding\r\ntheir effects.\r\n\r\n_Malt-Dust, Bran, Chaff, etc._--The value of these substances as manures\r\nis chiefly dependent on the nitrogen they contain, though to some extent\r\nalso on their inorganic constituents. Malt-dust contains about 4.5 per\r\ncent, and bran 3.2 per cent of nitrogen. But they are little used as\r\nmanures, as they can generally be more advantageously employed for\r\nfeeding. The value of chaff more nearly resembles that of straw.\r\n\r\n_Straw_ is occasionally employed as a manure, and sometimes even as a\r\ntop-dressing for grass land. It is generally admitted, however, that its\r\napplication in the dry state, and especially as a top-dressing, is a\r\npractice not to be recommended, as it decomposes too slowly in the soil;\r\nand it is always desirable to ferment it in the manure heap, so as to\r\nfacilitate the production of ammonia from its nitrogen. Still\r\ncircumstances may occur in which it becomes necessary to employ it in\r\nthe dry state, and it will generally prove most valuable on heavy soils,\r\nwhich it serves to keep open, and so promotes the access of air, and\r\nenables it to act on the soil. On light sandy soils it generally proves\r\nless advantageous, as its tendency of course is to increase the openness\r\nof the soil, and render it less able to retain the essential\r\nconstituents of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of nitrogen in straw does not exceed 0.2 per cent, and its\r\nvalue is mainly due to its inorganic constituents and to its mechanical\r\neffect on the soil.\r\n\r\n_Saw-dust_ has little value as a manure, as it undergoes decomposition\r\nwith extreme slowness. It is a good _mechanical_ addition to heavy\r\nsoils, and diminishes their tenacity; and though its manurial effects\r\nare small, it sooner or later undergoes decomposition, and yields what\r\nvaluable matters it contains. The saw-dust of hard wood is to be\r\npreferred, both because it contains more valuable matters than that of\r\nsoft wood, and because the absence of resinous matters permits its more\r\nrapid decomposition. It is a useful absorbent of liquid manure, and may\r\nbe advantageously added to the dung-heap for that purpose.\r\n\r\n_Manuring with Fresh Vegetable Matter--Green Manuring._--The term green\r\nmanuring is applied to the system of sowing some rapidly growing plant,\r\nand ploughing it in when it has attained a certain size, and the success\r\nattending it, especially on soils poor in organic matters, is very\r\nmarked. It is obvious that this mode of manuring can add nothing to the\r\nmineral matters contained in the soil, and its utility must therefore be\r\ndue to the plant gathering organic matters from the air, which, by their\r\ndecomposition, yield nitrogen and carbonic acid--the former to be\r\ndirectly made use of by subsequent crops, the latter, in all\r\nprobability, acting also on the soil, and setting free its useful\r\nconstituents. Hence those plants which obtain the largest quantity of\r\ntheir organic elements from the air ought to be most advantageous for\r\ngreen manuring. The plants used for this purpose act also as a means of\r\nbringing up from the lower parts of the soil the valuable matters which\r\nexist in it out of reach of ordinary crops, and mixing them again with\r\nthe surface part. Many of the plants found most useful for green\r\nmanuring send down their roots to a considerable depth; and when they\r\nare ploughed in, all the substances which they have brought up are of\r\ncourse deposited in the upper few inches of the soil. Vegetable matter\r\nwhen ploughed in in the fresh state, also decomposes rapidly, and is\r\ntherefore able immediately to improve the subsequent crop; and as this\r\ndecomposition takes place in the soil without the loss of ammonia and\r\nother valuable matters, which is liable to occur to a greater or less\r\nextent when they are fermented on the dung-heap, it will be obvious that\r\nin no other mode can equally good results be obtained by its use.\r\n\r\nMany plants have been employed as green manure, and different opinions\r\nhave been expressed as to their relative values. In the selection of any\r\none for the purpose, that should of course be taken which grows most\r\nrapidly, and produces within a given time the largest quantity of\r\nvaluable matters, but no general rule can be given for the selection, as\r\nthe plant which fulfils those conditions best will differ in different\r\nsoils and climates. The plants most commonly employed in this country\r\nare spurry, white mustard, and turnips. Rye, clover, buckwheat, white\r\nlupins, rape, borage, and some others, have been largely employed\r\nabroad. Some of these are obviously unfitted for the climate of the\r\nBritish Islands; and the others, although they have been tried\r\noccasionally, do not appear to have been very extensively employed. The\r\nturnip is sown broadcast at the end of harvest, and ploughed in after\r\ntwo months. White mustard and spurry are employed in the same way as a\r\npreparation for winter wheat, and with the best results. The latter is\r\nsometimes sown as a spring crop in March, ploughed in in May, and\r\nanother crop sown which is ploughed in in June, and immediately\r\nfollowed by a third. The effect of this treatment is such that the worst\r\nsands may be made to bear a remunerative crop of rye.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to estimate the addition made by green manuring to the\r\nvaluable matters contained in the soil, but it is probably far from\r\ninconsiderable. A crop of turnips, cultivated on the ordinary\r\nagricultural system, after two months' growth, weighs between five and\r\nseven tons per acre, and contains nitrogen equivalent to about 48 lbs.\r\nof ammonia, and half a ton of organic matters; but nothing is known as\r\nto the quantity produced when it is sown broadcast, and is not thinned,\r\nalthough it must materially exceed this. Neither is it possible to\r\ndetermine the relative proportions derived from the soil and the air,\r\nalthough it is, in all probability, dependent on the resources of the\r\nsoil itself,--plants grown on a rich soil obtaining their chief supplies\r\nfrom it, while, on poorer soils, a larger proportion is drawn from the\r\natmosphere. Hence light and sandy soils are most benefited by green\r\nmanuring, partly on this account, and partly also, no doubt, because the\r\nvaluable inorganic matters, which are so liable to be washed out of\r\nthese soils, are accumulated by the plants and retained in them in a\r\nstate in which they are readily available for the subsequent crop.\r\n\r\n_Sea-Weed._--Sea-weeds have been employed from time immemorial as a\r\nmanure on the coasts of Scotland and England, in quantities varying from\r\n10 to 20 tons per acre. Their action is necessarily similar to that of\r\ngreen manure ploughed in, as they contain all the ordinary constituents\r\nof land plants.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined analyses of three of the most abundant species will\r\nsufficiently indicate their general composition.\r\n\r\n+----------------+--------+----------+----------------------------+-----------+\r\n|                |        |          |LAMINARIA DIGITATA.         |           |\r\n|                |        |          |                            |Mixed Weeds|\r\n|                |Fucus   | Fucus    +----------------+-----------+in the     |\r\n|                |nodosus.| vesicu.- |                | Stem and  |state in   |\r\n|                |        |   losus  | Collected      | Frond     |which they |\r\n|                |        |          |  in Autumn.    | collected |actually   |\r\n|                |        |          |                | in Spring.|are used   |\r\n+----------------+--------+----------+----------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n|Water           | 74.31  |   70.57  |       88.69    |    77.31  |   80.44   |\r\n|Albuminous      |        |          |                |           |           |\r\n|  compounds     |  1.76  |    2.01  |        0.93    |     3.32  |    2.85   |\r\n|Fibre, etc.     | 19.04  |   22.05  |        4.92    |    10.39  |    6.40   |\r\n|Ash             |  4.89  |    5.37  |        5.46    |     8.98  |   10.31   |\r\n|                +--------+----------+----------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n|                |100.00  |  100.00  |      100.00    |   100.00  |  100.00   |\r\n|Nitrogen        |  0.28  |    0.32  |        0.15    |     0.53  |    0.45   |\r\n|                |        |          |                |           |           |\r\n|The ash         |        |          |                |           |           |\r\n| consisted of   |        |          |                |           |           |\r\n|                |        |          |  Stem.

The rapidity of their decomposition is such, that when\r\nspread on the land they are seen to soften and disappear in a short\r\ntime. They form therefore a rapid manure, and their effects are said to\r\nbe confined to the crop to which they are applied; but this is probably\r\ndue to the fact, that they are chiefly used in inferior sandy soils, in\r\nwhich any manure is rapidly exhausted. In good soils there is no reason\r\nwhy their effect should not be as lasting as that of farm-yard manure,\r\nwhich, in many particulars, they considerably resemble. The method of\r\napplying sea-weeds most generally in use, is to spread them on the soil,\r\nand plough them in after putrefaction has commenced, and it is on the\r\nwhole the most advantageous. But they are sometimes composted with lime\r\nand earth, or mixed with farm-yard manure, and occasionally, also, they\r\nare used as a top-dressing to grass land.\r\n\r\nOn some parts of the western coast of Scotland and in the Hebrides,\r\nsea-weed is the chief manure. It gives excellent crops of potatoes, but\r\nthey are said to be of inferior quality, unless marl or shell-sand is\r\nemployed at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Leaves_ may be used as a manure, simply by ploughing them in, by\r\ncomposting them with lime, or by adding them to the manure heap.\r\n\r\n_Peat._--As a source of organic matter, peat may be used with advantage,\r\nespecially on soils in which it is naturally deficient. Dry peat of good\r\nquality contains about one per cent of nitrogen, and a quantity of ash\r\nvarying from five to twenty per cent. These substances, however, become\r\navailable very slowly, owing to the tardy decay of peat in its natural\r\nstate; and in order to make it useful, it is necessary to compost it\r\nwith lime, or to mix it with farm-yard manure, or some readily\r\nputrescible substance, so that its decomposition may be accelerated. It\r\nmay be most advantageously used as an absorbent of liquid manure, and on\r\nthis account, forms a useful addition to the manure heap.\r\n\r\nThe observations which have been made regarding the use of these\r\nsubstances, lead directly to the inference that all vegetable matters\r\npossess a certain manurial value, and that they ought to be carefully\r\ncollected and preserved. In fact, the careful farmer adds everything of\r\nthe sort to his manure heap, where, by undergoing fermentation along\r\nwith the manure, their nitrogen becomes immediately available to the\r\nplant; while the seeds of weeds are destroyed during the fermentation,\r\nand the risk of the land being rendered dirty by their springing up when\r\nthe manure comes to be used is prevented.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: The presence of sulphuret of sodium in this case is due to\r\nthe difficulty of completely burning the ash. It exists in the plant as\r\nsulphate of soda.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF ANIMAL MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nManures of animal origin are generally characterized by the large\r\nquantity of nitrogen they contain, which causes them to undergo\r\ndecomposition with great rapidity, and to yield the greater part of\r\ntheir valuable matters to the crop to which they are applied.\r\n\r\n_Guano._--By far the most important animal manure is guano, which is\r\ncomposed of the solid excrements of carnivorous birds in a more or less\r\ncompletely decomposed state, and is accumulated in immense quantities on\r\nthe coasts of South America and other tropical countries. It has been\r\nused as a manure in Peru from time immemorial, but the accounts given by\r\nthe older travellers of its marvellous effects were considered to be\r\nfabulous, until Humboldt, from personal observation, confirmed their\r\nstatements. It was first imported into this country in 1840, in which\r\nyear a few barrels of it were brought home; and from that time its\r\nimportation rapidly increased. Soon after large deposits of it were\r\nfound in Ichaboe; and it has since been brought from many other\r\nlocalities. The quantity of guanos of all kinds imported into this\r\ncountry and retained for home consumption now exceeds 240,000 tons a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe value of guano differs greatly according to the extent to which its\r\ndecomposition has gone, and this is chiefly dependent on the climate of\r\nthe locality from which it is obtained. When deposited in the rainless\r\ndistricts of Peru it still retains some of the uric acid and the greater\r\npart of the ammonia naturally existing in it, and the quantity which has\r\nescaped by decomposition is unimportant. But that obtained from other\r\ndistricts has suffered a more or less complete decomposition according\r\nto the humidity of the climate, which reduces the quantity of organic\r\nmatters and ammonia, until, in some varieties, they are so small as to\r\nbe of little importance. The following are minute analyses of three\r\nspecimens of Peruvian guano, shewing all the different constituents it\r\ncontains, and the amount of difference which may exist:--\r\n\r\n                                   I.

But such analyses are too elaborate for ordinary\r\npurposes, and much less convenient for comparison and for estimating the\r\nvalue of the guano than the shorter analysis commonly in use, which\r\ngives the water, the loss by ignition (that is, the sum of the organic\r\nmatters and ammoniacal salts), the phosphates, the alkaline salts, and\r\nthe quantity of phosphoric acid contained in them, and existing there in\r\na state similar to that in which it is found in the soluble phosphates\r\nof a superphosphate. In addition to these, the quantities of sand and\r\nother less valuable ingredients are also stated.\r\n\r\nIn the subjoined tables the composition of a great variety of different\r\nkinds of guano is given. Most of these are averages deduced from a\r\nconsiderable number of analyses of good samples. Those of some kinds of\r\nguano, such as Peruvian, which present a considerable amount of\r\nuniformity, afford a sufficiently accurate idea of the general\r\ncomposition of the variety, but in other cases they are of less value,\r\nbecause the imports of different seasons, and even of different cargoes,\r\ndiffer so greatly in composition that no proper average can be made.\r\nSeveral of these varieties are already exhausted, the importation of\r\nothers has ceased, and new varieties are constantly being introduced.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the Average Composition of different varieties of

abundance of\r\nammonia, the other by that of phosphates; and which, for convenience\r\nsake, may be called ammoniacal and phosphatic guanos. Peruvian and\r\nAngamos are characteristic of the former, and Saldanha Bay and Bolivian\r\nof the latter class. The value of these two classes of guano differs\r\nmaterially, and they are also applicable under different circumstances,\r\nbut to these points reference will afterwards be made.\r\n\r\nVery special precautions are necessary on the part of the farmer in\r\norder to insure his obtaining a guano which is not adulterated, and of\r\ngood quality if genuine. In the case of Peruvian guano, which is\r\ntolerably uniform in its qualities, it is possible to form some opinion\r\nby careful examination, and the following points ought to be attended\r\nto:\r\n\r\n1st, The guano should be light coloured. If it is dark, the chances are\r\nthat it has been damaged by water.\r\n\r\n2d, It should be dry, and when a handful is well squeezed together it\r\nshould cohere very slightly.\r\n\r\n3d, It should not have too powerful an ammoniacal odour.\r\n\r\n4th, It should contain lumps, which, when broken, appear of a paler\r\ncolour than the powdery part of the sample.\r\n\r\n5th, When rubbed between the fingers it should not be gritty.\r\n\r\n6th, A bushel of the guano should not weigh more than from 56 to 60 lbs.\r\n\r\nThese characters must not, however, be too implicitly relied on, for\r\nthey are all imitated with wonderful ingenuity by the skilful\r\nadulterator, and they are applicable only to Peruvian guano; the others\r\nbeing so variable that no general rules can be given for determining\r\nwhether they are genuine. Neither are they so precise as to enable us to\r\ngive any opinion regarding the relative values of several samples where\r\nall are genuine. The only way in which adulteration can with certainty\r\nbe detected, and the value of different guanos be determined, is by\r\nanalysis, and the importance of this can easily be illustrated.\r\n\r\nIn the table above, the _average_ composition of the different guanos is\r\ngiven; but in order to shew how much individual cargos may differ from\r\nthe mean, we give here analyses of samples of the highest and lowest\r\nquality of the genuine guanos of most importance:\r\n\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n|                   |    Angamos.       |    Peruvian.     |    Bolivian.     |\r\n|                   +---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n|                   |Highest. |Lowest.  |Highest. |Lowest. |Highest. |Lowest. |\r\n|                   +---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n| Water             |  12.60  |   7.09  |  10.37  | 21.49  |  11.53  |  16.20 |\r\n| Organic matter  } |         |         |         |        |         |        |\r\n|  and ammoniacal } |  65.62  |  50.83  |  55.73  | 46.26  |  11.17  |  12.86 |\r\n|  salts          } |         |         |         |        |         |        |\r\n| Phosphates        |  10.83  |   8.70  |  25.20  | 18.93  |  62.99  |  52.95 |\r\n| Alkaline salts    |   7.50  |  16.30  |   7.50  | 10.64  |   9.93  |  13.83 |\r\n| Sand              |   3.45  |  17.08  |   1.20  |  2.68  |   4.38  |   4.16 |\r\n|                   +---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n|                   | 100.00  | 100.00  | 100.00  |100.00  | 100.00  | 100.00 |\r\n|                   |         |         |         |        |         |        |\r\n| Ammonia           |  25.33  |  17.15  |  18.95  | 14.65  |   1.89  |   2.23 |\r\n+-------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe differences are here exceedingly large; and when the values of the\r\ntwo Peruvian guanos are calculated according to the method to be\r\nafterwards described, it appears that the highest exceeds the lowest in\r\nvalue by nearly L3 per ton. Of course, this is an extreme case, but it\r\nis no uncommon occurrence to find a difference of L1 or even L2 per ton\r\nbetween the values of cargos of Peruvian guano, which are sold at the\r\nsame price.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of guano is carried on to a very large extent; and\r\nthough perhaps not quite so extensively now as it was some years since,\r\nit is only kept in check by the utmost vigilance on the part of the\r\npurchaser. The chief adulterations are a sort of yellow loam very\r\nsimilar in appearance to guano, sand, gypsum, common salt, and\r\noccasionally also ground coprolites and inferior guano. These substances\r\nare rarely used singly, but are commonly mixed in such proportions as\r\nmost closely to imitate the colour and general appearance of the genuine\r\narticle. The extent to which the adulteration is carried may be judged\r\nof from the following analyses taken at random from those of a large\r\nnumber of guanos, all of which were sold as first-class Peruvian.\r\n\r\nWater                  12.85   15.19   12.06   27.86   6.32\r\nOrganic matter and }\r\n  ammoniacal salts }   26.84   44.31   34.14   30.41  27.42\r\nPhosphates             15.54   20.95   22.08   22.17  33.61\r\nSulphate of lime        ...     ...    11.08    ...   22.11\r\nAlkaline salts          6.07    9.40   12.81    7.92  22.50\r\nSand                   38.70   10.15    7.83    1.64  10.15\r\n                      ------  ------  ------  ------ ------\r\n                      100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00 100.00\r\n\r\nAmmonia                 9.34   13.90    9.77    8.64   9.76\r\n\r\nIn all those cases a very large depreciation in the value has taken\r\nplace, and several of them are worth considerably less than half the\r\nprice of the genuine guano, while they are generally offered for sale at\r\nabout L1 under the usual price. The adulteration is chiefly practised in\r\nLondon, and cases occasionally occur which can be traced to Liverpool\r\nand other places; but it always takes place in the large towns, because\r\nit is only there that facilities exist for obtaining the necessary\r\nmaterials and carrying it out without exciting suspicion. The\r\nsophisticated article then passes into the hands of the small country\r\ndealers, to whom it is sold with the assurance that it is genuine, and\r\nanalysis quite unnecessary. In other instances, adulterated and inferior\r\nguanos are sold by the analysis of a genuine sample, and sometimes an\r\nanalysis is made to do duty for many successive cargos of a guano which,\r\nthough all obtained from one deposit, may differ excessively in\r\ncomposition. In order to insure obtaining a genuine guano, it is above\r\nall things important to deal only with a person of established\r\ncharacter, who will generally, for his own sake, satisfy himself that\r\nthe article he vends is genuine and of good quality; and it is always\r\nimportant that the buyer should examine the analysis, and in all cases\r\nwhere there is the slightest doubt, should ascertain that the bulk sent\r\ncorresponds with it. In the case of a Peruvian guano, a complete\r\nanalysis is not necessary for this purpose; but an experienced chemist,\r\nby the application of a few tests, can readily ascertain whether the\r\nsample is genuine. Where the difference in value between different\r\nsamples is required, a complete analysis is necessary, and this is\r\nindispensable in the case of the inferior guanos. Many of these are\r\nobtained from deposits of limited extent, and in loading it considerable\r\nquantities of the subjacent soil are taken up, so that very great\r\ndifferences may exist even in different parts of the same cargo. Nor\r\nmust it be forgotten that, except in the case of Peruvian, the name is\r\nno guarantee for the quality of the guano, even if genuine. Peruvian\r\nguano is all obtained from the same deposits, those of the Chincha\r\nIslands, but the guanos which are brought into the market under the name\r\nof Patagonian, Chilian, etc., are obtained from a great variety of\r\ndeposits scattered along the coasts of these countries, sometimes at a\r\ndistance of several hundred miles from each other, and which have been\r\naccumulated under totally different circumstances. In illustration of\r\nthis, it is only necessary to refer to the subjoined analysis of\r\nsamples, all of which I believe to be genuine as imported, and which\r\nwere sold under the name of Upper Peruvian Guano.\r\n\r\n                                         I.

The Saldanha Bay, and other similar deposits,\r\nhave been exhausted, and few guanos of equally good quality have been\r\nlately discovered. There is no doubt, however, that such guanos are very\r\nuseful, and if obtained in large quantity, and of uniform composition,\r\nwould be used to a much larger extent than they at present are.\r\n\r\nThe value and use of guano are now so well understood, that it is\r\nscarcely necessary to enlarge on the mode of its application. Peruvian\r\nguano owes its chief value to its ammonia and phosphates, but it also\r\ncontains potash, soda, and all the other constituents of plants in small\r\nquantity, although in a readily available condition, as is seen in the\r\ndetailed analysis given in page 205.\r\n\r\nIn other guanos which have undergone more complete decomposition, and\r\nfrom which the soluble matters have been more or less completely\r\nexhausted by rain, the alkaline salts, or at least the potash they\r\noriginally contained, have almost entirely disappeared. Hence an\r\nimportant difference between Peruvian guano and most other varieties.\r\nThe former can be used as a complete substitute for farm-yard manure,\r\nand excellent crops of turnips and potatoes can be raised by means of it\r\nalone, and at a less cost than with ordinary dung. But though this may\r\nbe done, and in many cases is attended with great economic advantages,\r\nit is a practice that cannot be recommended for general use, because the\r\nquantity of valuable matters contained in the usual application of guano\r\nis much smaller than in farm-yard manure, and the probability is that it\r\nwould not, if used alone during a succession of years, be sufficient to\r\nmaintain the soil permanently in a high state of fertility. Five cwt. of\r\nPeruvian guano, which is a liberal application per acre, contains about\r\n95 lbs. of ammonia, and 130 of phosphates, while 20 tons of good\r\nfarm-yard manure contain 312 of ammonia, and about the same quantity of\r\nphosphates, and when the other constituents, such as potash and soda,\r\nare compared with those in guano, the difference is still more striking.\r\nOn the other hand, guano is a rapidly acting manure; its constituents\r\nare in a condition in which they are more immediately accessible by the\r\nplant, and its immediate effect is far more marked, as it is chiefly\r\nexpended on the crop to which it is applied. It has indeed been alleged\r\nthat it produces no effects on the subsequent crops, but this opinion\r\ncan scarcely be considered as well founded. In no case does the crop\r\nraised by means of it contain the whole of the ammonia or phosphates\r\npresent in the manure, and the unappropriated quantity, though it may,\r\nand probably does, escape from the lighter soils, must be retained and\r\npreserved for the use of subsequent crops by heavy and retentive clay\r\nsoils. The general inference is, that though guano may at an emergency\r\nbe used as an entire substitute for farm-yard manure, the practice is\r\none to be generally avoided. When, however, as occasionally happens\r\nafter a long continued use of farm-yard manure, organic matters have\r\naccumulated in the soil, and passed into an inert condition, then\r\nPeruvian guano may be used alone with very great advantage. In all cases\r\nthe rapidity of the action of guano makes it an important auxiliary of\r\nfarm-yard manure, and it is in this way that it may be most\r\nadvantageously employed. Experience has shewn that one-half the\r\nfarm-yard manure may be replaced by guano with the production of a\r\nlarger crop than by the former alone in its full quantity. The\r\nproportion of guano usually employed is from three to five cwt., and it\r\nis alleged that a much larger quantity produces prejudicial effects on\r\nthe subsequent crops, although it is not very easy to see on what this\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nThe variety of guano to be selected must depend to a great extent on the\r\nuse to which it is to be put. Peruvian guano is most advantageously\r\napplied as a top-dressing to young corn and particularly to oats. For\r\nthe turnip, the ammoniacal guanos were formerly preferred, and on strong\r\nsoils, under good cultivation, their effects are excellent, but on\r\nlight soils they are less applicable, their soluble salts being more\r\nrapidly washed out, and their effects lost, and in these cases they are\r\nsurpassed by the phosphatic guanos.\r\n\r\nNo definite rules can be given for determining the soils on which these\r\ndifferent varieties are most applicable, but each individual must\r\ndetermine by experiment that which best suits his own farm; and the\r\ninquiry is of much importance to him, as, of course, if the phosphatic\r\nguanos will answer as well as the ammoniacal, there is a large saving in\r\nthe cost of the manure. A very excellent practice is to employ a mixture\r\nof equal parts of the two sorts of guano.\r\n\r\n_Pigeons' Dung._--The dung of all birds, which more or less closely\r\nresembles guano, may be employed with much advantage as a manure, but\r\nthat of the pigeon and the common fowl are the only ones which can be\r\ngot in quantity. Pigeons' dung, according to Boussingault, contains 8.3\r\nper cent of nitrogen, equivalent to 10.0 of ammonia. Its value,\r\ntherefore, will be more than half that of guano, but it varies greatly,\r\nand a sample imported from Egypt into this country, and analysed by\r\nProfessor Johnston, contained only 5.4 per cent of ammonia. Hens' dung\r\nhas not been accurately analysed, but its value must be about the same\r\nas pigeons'.\r\n\r\n_Urate and Sulphated Urine._--We have already discussed the urine of\r\nanimals, in reference to farm-yard manure. But human urine, the\r\ncomposition of which was then stated, is of much higher value than that\r\nof the lower animals, and many attempts have been made to preserve and\r\nconvert it into a dry manure. Urate is prepared by adding gypsum to\r\nurine, and collecting and drying the precipitate produced. It contains a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the phosphoric acid of the urine, but very\r\nlittle of its ammonia; and as the principal value of urine depends on\r\nthe latter, it is necessarily a very inefficient method of turning it to\r\naccount. A better method has been proposed by Dr. Stenhouse, who adds\r\nlime-water to the urine, and collects the precipitate, which, when dried\r\nin the air, contains 1.91 per cent of nitrogen, and about 41 per cent of\r\nphosphates. This method is subject to the same objection as that by\r\nwhich urate is made, namely, that the greater part of the ammonia is not\r\nprecipitated. This might probably be got over to some extent by the\r\naddition of sulphate of magnesia, or, still better, of chloride of\r\nmagnesium, which would throw down the phosphate of magnesia and ammonia.\r\nBy much the best mode of employing urine is in the form of sulphated\r\nurine, which is made by adding to it a sufficient quantity of sulphuric\r\nacid to neutralize its ammonia, and evaporating to dryness. In this form\r\nall the valuable constituents are retained, and excellent results are\r\nobtained from it. Its effects, though mainly attributable to its\r\nammonia, are also in part dependent on the phosphates and alkaline salts\r\nwhich it contains; and it is therefore capable of supplying to the plant\r\na larger number of its constituents than the animal matters already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Night-Soil and Poudrette._--The value of night-soil, which is well\r\nknown, depends partly on the urine, and partly on the faeces of which it\r\nis formed. Its disagreeable odour has prevented its general use, and\r\nvarious methods have been contrived both for deodorising and converting\r\nit into a solid and portable form. The same difficulties which beset the\r\nconversion of urine into the solid form occur here, and in most of the\r\nmethods employed the loss of ammonia is great. It is sometimes mixed\r\nwith lime or gypsum, and dried with heat, and sometimes with animal\r\ncharcoal or peat charcoal. The manufacture of a manure from night-soil,\r\ncalled \"poudrette,\" has long been practised in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis and other continental towns. The process employed at Montfaucon\r\nand at Bondy is very simple. The contents of the cesspools are conveyed\r\nto the work in large barrels, which are then emptied into tanks capable\r\nof containing the accumulation of several months. When filled they are\r\nallowed to stand for some time, during which the smell diminishes and\r\nthe contents become nearly dry. The residue is then dug out and mixed\r\nwith ashes, dry loam, charcoal powder, peat, peat-charcoal, saw-dust,\r\nand other matters, so as to deodorize it, and render it sufficiently dry\r\nfor transport. Its general composition may be judged of from the\r\nsubjoined analyses of samples from different places:--\r\n\r\n                       Montfaucon.   Bondy.  Dresden.

They are highly\r\nnitrogenous substances, and owe their entire value to the nitrogen they\r\ncontain, their inorganic constituents being in too small quantity to be\r\nof any importance, wool and hair having only 2 per cent, and horn 0.7\r\nper cent of ash. In the pure and dry state, and after subtraction of the\r\nash, their composition is,--\r\n\r\n                   Skin.  Human hair.       Wool.     Horn.\r\nCarbon             50.99    50.65           50.65     51.99\r\nHydrogen            7.07     6.36            7.03      6.72\r\nNitrogen           18.72    17.14           17.71     17.28\r\nOxygen             23.22    20.85   }       24.61     24.01\r\nSulphur             ...      5.00   }\r\n                  ------   ------          ------    ------\r\n                  100.00   100.00          100.00    100.00\r\n\r\nIt rarely if ever happens, however, that the refuse offered for sale as\r\na manure is pure. It always contains water, sand, and other foreign\r\nmatters. Woollen rags are mixed with cotton which has no manurial value,\r\nand the skin refuse from tan-works contains much lime. Due allowance\r\nmust therefore be made for such impurities which are sometimes present\r\nin very large quantity.\r\n\r\nRefuse horse hair generally contains 11 or 12 per cent of nitrogen.\r\nWoollen rags of good quality contain 12.7 per cent of nitrogen; woollen\r\ncuttings about 14; and what is called shoddy only 5.5 per cent. Horn\r\nshavings are extremely variable in their amount of nitrogen; when pure,\r\nthey sometimes contain as much as 12.5 per cent, but a great deal of the\r\nhorn shavings from comb manufactories, etc., contain much sand and bone\r\ndust, by which their percentage of nitrogen is greatly diminished, and\r\nit sometimes does not exceed 5 or 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nAll these substances are highly valuable as manures, but it must be\r\nborne in mind that they undergo decomposition very slowly in the soil,\r\nand hence are chiefly applicable to slow growing crops, and to those\r\nwhich require a strong soil. Woollen rags have been largely employed as\r\na manure for hops, and are believed to surpass every other substance for\r\nthat crop. As a manure applicable to the ordinary purposes of the farm\r\nthey have scarcely met with that attention which they deserve, probably\r\nbecause their first action is slow and the farmer is more accustomed to\r\nlook to immediate than to future results; but they possess the important\r\nqualification of adding permanently to the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\n_Blood_ is a most valuable manure, but it is not much employed in this\r\ncountry, at least in the neighbourhood of large towns, as there is a\r\ndemand for it for other purposes, and it can rarely be obtained by the\r\nfarmer in large quantity, and at a sufficiently low price. In its\r\nnatural state it contains about 3 per cent of nitrogen, and after being\r\ndried up, the residue contains about 15 per cent. It is best used in the\r\nform of a compost with peat or mould, and this forms an excellent manure\r\nfor turnips, and is also advantageously applied as a top-dressing to\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\n_Flesh._--The flesh of all animals is useful as a manure, and is\r\nespecially distinguished by the rapidity with which it undergoes\r\ndecomposition, and yields up its valuable matters to the plant. It is\r\nrarely employed in its natural state, but horse flesh was at one time\r\nconverted into a dry and portable manure, although, I understand, this\r\nmanufacture is not now prosecuted. The dead animal after being skinned\r\nis cut up and boiled in large cauldrons until the flesh is separated\r\nfrom the bones. The latter are removed, and the flesh dried upon a flat\r\nstove. The flesh as sold has the following composition:--\r\n\r\nWater                                12.17\r\nOrganic matter                       78.44\r\nPhosphate of lime, etc.               3.82\r\nAlkaline salts                        3.64\r\nSand                                  1.93\r\n                                    ------\r\n                                    100.00\r\nNitrogen                              9.22\r\nAmmonia to which the nitrogen is }\r\nequivalent                       }   11.20\r\n\r\nThe dried flesh and small bones of cattle, from the great slaughtering\r\nestablishments of South America, was at one time imported into this\r\ncountry under the name of flesh manure. Its composition was--\r\n\r\nWater                                9.05\r\nFat                                 11.13\r\nAnimal matter                       39.52\r\nPhosphate of lime                   28.74\r\nCarbonate of lime                    3.81\r\nAlkaline salts                       0.57\r\nSand                                 7.18\r\n                                   ------\r\n                                   100.00\r\nNitrogen                             5.56\r\nAmmonia to which the nitrogen is }\r\nequivalent                       }   6.67\r\n\r\nBut owing to the large proportion of phosphates contained in it, it may\r\nbe most fairly compared with bones. It is not now imported, the results\r\nobtained from its use being said not to have proved satisfactory,\r\nalthough this statement appears very paradoxical.\r\n\r\n_Fish_ have been employed in considerable quantity as a manure. That\r\nmost extensively employed in this country is the sprat, which is\r\noccasionally caught in enormous quantities on the Norfolk coast, and\r\nused as an application for turnips. They are sold at 8d. per bushel,\r\nand their composition is--\r\n\r\nWater             64.6\r\nOrganic matter    33.3\r\nAsh                2.1\r\n                 -----\r\n                 100.0\r\nNitrogen          1.90\r\nPhosphoric acid   0.91\r\n\r\nThe refuse of herring and other fish-curing establishments, whales'\r\nblubber, and similar fish refuse, are all useful as manure, and are\r\nemployed whenever they can be obtained. They are not usually employed\r\nalone, but are more advantageously made into composts with their own\r\nweight of soil, and allowed to ferment thoroughly before being applied.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to convert the offal of the great\r\nfish-curing establishments, and the inedible fish, of which large\r\nquantities are often caught, into a dry manure, which has received the\r\nname of \"fish guano.\" The processes employed have consisted in boiling\r\nwith sulphuric acid and other agents, and then evaporating, or sometimes\r\nby simply drying up the refuse by steam heat. A manure made in this way\r\nproved to have the following composition:--\r\n\r\nWater                                   8.00\r\nFatty matters                           7.20\r\nNitrogeneous organic matters           71.46\r\nPhosphate of lime                       8.70\r\nAlkaline salts                          3.80\r\nSand                                    0.84\r\n                                      ------\r\n                                      100.00\r\n\r\nNitrogen                                11.25\r\nEqual to ammonia                        13.68\r\nPhosphoric acid in the alkaline salts, } 0.65\r\n   equal to 1.41 phosphate of lime     }\r\n\r\nThe expense of manufacturing manures of this description has hitherto\r\nacted as a barrier to their introduction. In this country several\r\nmanufactories have been established, but either owing to this cause, or\r\nto the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently large and uniform supplies\r\nof the raw material, some of them have not proved successful, but a\r\nmanufactory is now in operation in Norway, which exports the manure to\r\nGermany. It is probable that most of the processes used in this country\r\nfailed because they were too costly, and it is much to be desired that\r\nthe subject should be actively taken up. It is said that the refuse from\r\nthe Newfoundland fisheries is capable of yielding about 10,000 tons of\r\nfish guano annually; and the quantity obtainable on our own coasts is\r\nalso very considerable.\r\n\r\n_Bones._--Bones have been used as a manure for a long period, but they\r\nfirst attracted the particular attention of agriculturists from the\r\nremarkable effects produced by their application on the exhausted\r\npasture lands of Cheshire. During the present century they came into\r\ngeneral use on arable land, and especially as a manure for turnips; and\r\nthey are now imported in large quantities from the continent of Europe.\r\nThe bones used in agriculture are chiefly those of cattle, but sheep and\r\nhorse bones are also employed. They do not differ much in quality when\r\ngenuine. The subjoined analysis is that of a good sample.\r\n\r\nWater                                   6.20\r\nOrganic matter                         39.13\r\nPhosphate of lime                      48.95\r\nLime                                    2.57\r\nMagnesia                                0.30\r\nSulphuric acid                          2.55\r\nSilica                                  0.30\r\n                                      ------\r\n                                      100.00\r\nAmmonia which the organic matter }\r\n   is capable of yielding        }      4.80\r\n\r\nIn general, bones may be said to contain about half their weight of\r\nphosphate of lime, and 10 or 12 per cent of water. But, in addition to\r\ntheir natural state, they are met with in other forms in commerce, in\r\nwhich their organic matter has been extracted either by boiling or\r\nburning. The latter is especially common in the form of the spent animal\r\ncharcoal of the sugar refiners, which usually contains from 70 to 80 per\r\ncent of phosphate of lime, but when deprived of their organic matter,\r\nthey may be more correctly considered under the head of mineral manures.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis given above, it is obvious that the manurial value of\r\nbones is dependent partly on their phosphates and partly on the ammonia\r\nthey yield. It has been common to attribute their entire effects to the\r\nformer, but this is manifestly erroneous; and although there are no\r\ndoubt cases in which the former act most powerfully, the benefit derived\r\nfrom the ammonia yielded by the organic matter is unequivocal. When the\r\nphosphates only are of use, burnt bones or the spent animal charcoal of\r\nthe sugar refiners are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nAt their first introduction, bones were applied in large fragments, and\r\nin quantities of from 20 to 30 cwt., or even more, per acre, but as\r\ntheir use became more general they were gradually employed in smaller\r\npieces, until at last they were reduced to dust, and it was found that,\r\nin a fine state of division, a few hundredweights produced as great an\r\neffect as the larger quantity of the unground bones. Even the most\r\ncomplete grinding which can be attained, however, leaves the bones in a\r\nmuch less minute state of division than guano, and they necessarily act\r\nmore slowly than it does, the more especially as they contain no\r\nready-formed ammonia. They may be still further reduced by fermentation,\r\nwhich acts by decomposing the organic matter, and causing the production\r\nof ammonia; but not as is frequently, though erroneously supposed, by\r\nconverting the phosphates into a soluble condition, for this does not\r\noccur to any extent, and their more rapid action is solely due to the\r\npartial decomposition of the organic matter, by which it is brought into\r\na condition capable of undergoing a more rapid change in the soil. The\r\nrapidity of action of bones is still more promoted by solution in\r\nsulphuric acid, by which they are converted into the form of dissolved\r\nbones or superphosphate. At the present moment, however, very little of\r\nthe superphosphates sold in the market are made exclusively from bones\r\nin their natural state, by far the larger portion being manufactured\r\nfrom mineral phosphates, or from bones after destruction of their\r\norganic matter, sometimes with the addition of small quantities of\r\nunburnt bones, but more frequently of sulphate of ammonia, to yield the\r\nrequisite quantity of ammonia. These substances may therefore be best\r\nconsidered under the head of mineral manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF MINERAL MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral manure is a term which is now used with great laxity. In its\r\nstrict sense, it means manures which contain only, and owe their\r\nexclusive value to the presence of, those substances which go to make up\r\nthe inorganic part or ash of plants. It has, however, been usually taken\r\nto include all saline matters, and especially the compounds of ammonia\r\nand nitric acid, which are indebted for their manurial effects to the\r\nnitrogen they contain; and thus is so far incorrect. It would, however,\r\nbe manifestly impossible to arrange these compounds with any degree of\r\naccuracy among either animal or vegetable manures, and hence the\r\nnecessity of including them amongst those which are strictly mineral.\r\nThe most important practical distinction between them and the substances\r\ndiscussed in the two preceding chapters is, that the latter generally\r\ncontain the whole or the greater part of the constituents of plants.\r\nEven bones yield a certain quantity of alkalies, magnesia, sulphuric\r\nacid, and chlorine, and may in some sense be considered as a general\r\nmanure. But those to which the term mineral manure is applied for the\r\nmost part contain only one or two of the essential elements of plants,\r\nand hence cannot be applied as substitutes for the substances already\r\ndiscussed, although they are frequently most important additions to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate and Muriate of Ammonia._--These and other salts of ammonia\r\nhave been tried experimentally as manures, and it has been ascertained\r\nthat they may all be used with equal success; but as the sulphate is by\r\nmuch cheaper, it is that which probably will always be employed to the\r\nexclusion of every other. It contains, when pure, 25.7 per cent ammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is now manufactured of excellent quality for agricultural use, and\r\nwhen good, contains from 95 to 97 per cent of actual sulphate, the\r\nremainder consisting chiefly of moisture and a small quantity of fixed\r\nresidue; but specimens are occasionally met with containing as much as\r\n10 per cent of impurities, which, as its price is high, makes a material\r\ndifference in its value. Inferior descriptions are also occasionally\r\nsold, among which is a variety distinguished by containing a large\r\nquantity of water and fixed salts, although it appears to the eye a good\r\narticle. Its composition is--\r\n\r\n                                  I.

It is obtained as a refuse product in the manufacture of magnesia,\r\nand is a mixture of sulphate and muriate of ammonia, with various\r\nalkaline salts. It differs somewhat in quality, and is sold by analysis\r\nat a price dependent on the ammonia it contains.\r\n\r\n                          I.

Some care,\r\nhowever, is necessary in applying this test, as in the hands of\r\ninexperienced persons it is sometimes fallacious. The salts of ammonia\r\nmay be applied in the same way as guano; but they are most\r\nadvantageously employed as a top-dressing, and principally to grass\r\nlands. In this way very remarkable effects are produced, and within a\r\nweek after the application, the difference between the dressed and\r\nundressed portions of a field is already conspicuous. Experience has\r\nshewn that success is best insured when the salt is applied during or\r\nimmediately before rain, so that it may be at once incorporated with the\r\nsoil; as when used in dry weather little or no benefit is derived from\r\nit. It seems also to exert a peculiarly beneficial effect upon clover;\r\nand hence it ought to be employed only on clover-hay, as where ryegrass\r\nor other grasses form the whole of the crop we have better manures.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal Liquor of the Gas-Works, and of the Animal Charcoal\r\nManufacturers._--Both of these are excellent forms in which to apply\r\nammonia, when they can be obtained. The ammoniacal liquor of the\r\ngas-works is very variable in quality, but contains generally from 4 to\r\n8 ounces of dry ammonia per gallon, which corresponds in round numbers\r\nto from 1 to 2 lb. of sulphate of ammonia. It is best applied with the\r\nwatering-cart, but must be diluted before use with three or four times\r\nits bulk of water, as if concentrated it burns up the grass, and it is\r\nalso advisable to use it during wet weather. The ammoniacal liquor of\r\nthe ivory-black works contains about 12 per cent of ammonia, or about\r\nfour or five times as much as gas liquor. It has been used in some parts\r\nof England, made into a compost, and applied to the turnip and other\r\ncrops, and, it is said, with good effect. _Bone oil_, which distils over\r\nalong with it, has also been used in the form of a compost; it contains\r\na large quantity of ammonia and of nitrogen in other forms of\r\ncombination; the total quantity of nitrogen it contains being 9.04 per\r\ncent, which is equivalent to 10.98 of ammonia. Only part of this\r\nnitrogen is actually in the state of ammonia; and some circumstances\r\nconnected with the chemical relations of the other nitrogenous compounds\r\nin this substance render it probable that they may pass very slowly into\r\nammonia, and may therefore be of inferior value; but the substance\r\ndeserves a trial, as it is very cheap. It must be carefully composted\r\nwith peat, and turned over several times before being used.\r\n\r\n_Nitrates of Potash and Soda._--Nitrate of potash has long been used as\r\na manure, but its high price has prevented its general application, and\r\nits place has now been almost entirely taken by nitrate of soda, which\r\nis much cheaper and contains weight for weight a larger quantity of\r\nnitrogen. Both these salts are employed as sources of nitrogen; but\r\nnitrate of potash owes also a certain proportion of its value to the\r\npotash it contains. Nitrate of soda, on the other hand, must be\r\nconsidered to owe its entire value to its nitric acid, as soda is of\r\nlittle value to the plant; and, moreover, can be obtained in common salt\r\nat a price so low, as to make it a matter of no moment in the valuation\r\nof the nitrate. In its ordinary state, as imported from Peru, nitrate of\r\nsoda contains from 5 to 10 per cent of impurities, and it bears a price\r\nproportionate to the quantity of the pure salt present in it. When of\r\ngood quality it contains about 15 per cent of nitrogen, equivalent to 18\r\nof ammonia, and is, therefore, richer in that constituent of plants than\r\nPeruvian guano. It is essentially a rapidly acting manure, and produces\r\na marked effect within a very few days after its application; but owing\r\nto the fact that nitric acid cannot be absorbed and retained by the soil\r\nin the same manner as ammonia, it is liable to be lost unless it can be\r\nat once assimilated by the plant. For this reason it acts best when\r\napplied in small quantity as a top-dressing to grass-land, and to young\r\ncorn. A large application has no advantages, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat the best effect would be produced by several very small quantities,\r\napplied at intervals. In one experiment, Mr. Pusey found 42 lb. per acre\r\nto increase the produce of barley by 7 bushels, and very favourable\r\nresults have been obtained by other experimenters. The beneficial\r\neffects of nitrate of soda appear to be almost entirely confined to the\r\ngrasses and cereals. At least experience here has shewn that it produces\r\nlittle or no effect on clover; and one farmer has stated, that having\r\nrecently adopted the practice of sowing clover with a very small\r\nproportion of ryegrass only, he has been led to abandon the use of\r\nnitrate of soda, which he formerly employed abundantly, when ryegrass\r\nformed a principal part of his crop. The action of nitrate of soda is\r\nvery remarkable, not only in this respect, but also because a given\r\nquantity of nitrogen in it _appears_ to produce a greater effect than\r\nthe same quantity in sulphate of ammonia or guano. At the same time this\r\nstatement must be taken as very general, definite experiments being\r\nstill too few to admit of its being stated as an absolute fact. The\r\nprobability is, that the same quantity of nitrogen, in the form either\r\nof ammonia or nitrate of soda, will produce the same effect, although\r\nthe conditions necessary for its successful action may not be the same\r\nwith the two manures. It is alleged that nitrate of soda is\r\nadvantageously conjoined with common salt, which is said to check its\r\ntendency to make the grain crops run to straw, and to prevent their\r\nlodging, as they are apt to do, when it is employed alone. But\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion exists in this point, many farmers\r\nbelieving that salt produces no effect. When employed for hay,\r\nespecially when mixed with clover, it is advisable to use it along with\r\nan equal quantity of sulphate of ammonia, which gives a better result\r\nthan either separately.\r\n\r\n_Salts of Potash and Soda._--The substances just mentioned must be\r\nconsidered to owe their chief manurial value to nitric acid; but other\r\nsalts have been used as manures in which the effect is undoubtedly due\r\nto the alkalies themselves. With the exception of common salt, most of\r\nthe alkaline salts have only been used to a limited extent; and it is\r\nremarkable that, so far as our present experience goes, there is no\r\nclass of substances from which more uncertain results are obtained.\r\n\r\n_Muriate and Sulphate of Potash_ have both been used, and the former\r\nhas in some cases, and in particular seasons, produced a very remarkable\r\neffect in the potato; but in other instances it has proved quite\r\nuseless. The cause of this difference has not been ascertained. Sulphate\r\nof soda has also been used to some extent, but apparently without much\r\nbenefit; and there is no reason to expect that it should act better than\r\ncommon salt, which can be obtained at a much lower price.\r\n\r\n_Chloride of Sodium, or Common Salt_, has at different times been\r\nemployed as a manure, but its effects are so variable and uncertain,\r\nthat its use, in place of increasing, has of late years rather\r\ndiminished, it having frequently been found that on soils in all\r\nrespects similar, or even on the same soil, in different years, it\r\nsometimes proves advantageous, at others positively injurious. Its use\r\nas an addition to nitrate of soda has been already alluded to, and it is\r\nsaid that it produces the same effect when mixed with guano and salts of\r\nammonia. The accuracy of this statement is doubted by many persons, and\r\nthe explanation which has been given of the cause of its action is more\r\nthan dubious. It is supposed to enable the plant to absorb more silica\r\nfrom the soil; but this is a speculative explanation of its action, and\r\nhas not been supported by definite experiment. Although little effect\r\nhas been observed from salt, it deserves a more accurate investigation,\r\nas not withstanding the extent to which it has been employed, we are\r\nsingularly deficient in definite experiments with it.\r\n\r\n_Carbonates of Potash and Soda_ have only been tried experimentally, and\r\nthat to a small extent, nor is it likely that they will ever come into\r\nuse, owing to their high price. The remarks we have made in the section\r\non the ashes of plants regarding the subordinate value of soda, will\r\nenable the reader to see that greater effects are to be anticipated\r\nfrom the former than from the latter of these salts. They _may_,\r\nhowever, exert a chemical action on the soil, altogether independent of\r\ntheir absorption by the plant, but its nature and amount are still to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\n_Silicates of Potash and Soda_ have been employed with the view of\r\nsupplying silica to the plant, but the results have been far from\r\nsatisfactory. This may perhaps have been due to the doubtful nature of\r\nthe commercial article, but now that silicate of soda can be obtained of\r\ngood quality, it is desirable that the experiments should be repeated.\r\nIt is said to have produced good effects on the potato.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Magnesia_ can be obtained at a low cost, and has been used\r\nas a manure in some instances with very marked success. It has been\r\nchiefly applied as a top-dressing to clover hay, but it seems probable\r\nthat it might prove a useful application to the cereals, the ash of\r\nwhich is peculiarly rich in magnesia.\r\n\r\nMany other saline substances have been tried as manures; but in most\r\ninstances on too limited a scale to permit any definite conclusions as\r\nto their value. The experiments have also been too frequently performed\r\nwithout the precautions necessary to exclude fallacy, so that the\r\nresults already arrived at must not be accepted as established facts,\r\nbut rather as indications of the direction in which further\r\ninvestigation would be valuable. There is little doubt that many of\r\nthese substances might be usefully employed, if the conditions necessary\r\nfor their successful application were eliminated; and no subject is at\r\npresent more deserving of elucidation by careful and well-devised field\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n_Phosphate of Lime._--The use of bones in their natural state as a\r\nmanure has been already adverted to, and it was stated, that though\r\ntheir value depended mainly on the phosphates, the animal matters and\r\nother substances contained in them were not without effect. The action\r\nof phosphates is greatly promoted by solution in sulphuric acid, and the\r\napplication of the acid has brought into use many varieties of\r\nphosphates of purely mineral origin, or which have been deprived of\r\ntheir organic matters by artificial processes. Of these, the spent\r\nanimal charcoal of the sugar-refiners, usually containing about 70 per\r\ncent of phosphates, and South American bone ash, are the most important.\r\nThe latter is now imported in very large quantity, and has the\r\ncomposition shewn in the following analyses:--\r\n\r\n                       I.

It has since been given to phosphatic\r\nconcretions found chiefly in the greensand in Suffolk and\r\nCambridgeshire, which are certainly not the same as those described by\r\nDr. Buckland, but consist of fragments of bones, ammonites, and other\r\nfossils. Coprolites are now collected in very large quantities, and\r\nabout 43,000 tons are annually employed. They are extremely hard, and\r\nrequire powerful machinery to reduce them to powder, and hence their\r\nprice is considerable, being about L2: 10s. per ton. Their composition\r\nvaries somewhat according to the care taken in selecting them, and the\r\nlocality from which they have been obtained. A general idea of their\r\ncomposition may be derived from the subjoined analyses:--\r\n\r\nWater                     1.95        1.90\r\nOrganic matter            2.59        6.85\r\nPhosphate of lime        55.21}      61.15\r\nPhosphate of iron         3.84}\r\nCarbonate of lime        26.70       16.20\r\nSulphate of lime          1.97         \"\r\nAlkaline salts            1.85        3.21\r\nSand                      5.89       11.65\r\n                        ------      ------\r\n                        100.00      100.00\r\n\r\nWithin the last two or three years, coprolites have been found in great\r\nabundance in France, but they are of inferior quality, and rarely\r\ncontain more than 40 per cent of phosphates.\r\n\r\n_Apatite_, or mineral phosphate of lime, is found in large deposits in\r\ndifferent places. It is particularly abundant in Spain, and occurs also\r\nin America and Norway. From the latter country it has been imported to\r\nsome extent; and during the last year considerable quantities have been\r\nbrought from Spain, and the importations will undoubtedly increase very\r\nlargely as the means of transport improve in that country. Spanish\r\napatite contains--\r\n\r\nWater                 0.80\r\nPhosphate of lime    93.30\r\nCarbonate of lime     0.50\r\nChlorine, etc.       traces\r\nSand                  4.70\r\n                     -----\r\n                     99.30\r\n\r\nSeveral other varieties of mineral phosphates have been imported under\r\nthe name of guano.

The manufacture of superphosphates depends on\r\nthe existence of two different compounds of phosphoric acid and lime,\r\none of which contains three times as much lime as the other. That which\r\ncontains the larger quantity of lime is found in the bones and all other\r\nnatural phosphates, and is quite insoluble in water; but when two-thirds\r\nof its lime are removed, it is converted into the other compound, which\r\nis exceedingly soluble. This change is effected by the use of sulphuric\r\nacid, which combines with two-thirds of the lime of the ordinary\r\ninsoluble phosphate of lime, and converts it into the _biphosphate of\r\nlime_, which is soluble. When, therefore, we add to 100 lbs. of common\r\nphosphate of lime the necessary quantity of sulphuric acid, it yields 64\r\nlbs. of biphosphate, containing the whole of the phosphoric acid, which\r\nis the valuable constituent, the diminution in weight being due to the\r\nremoval of the valueless lime. Hence it follows, also, that as the lime\r\nso removed is converted into sulphate, there must, for every 100 lbs. of\r\nphosphate of lime converted into biphosphate, be produced 87 lbs. of dry\r\nsulphate of lime, or 110 of the ordinary sulphate called gypsum. This is\r\nthe minimum quantity which can be present, but in actual practice it is\r\nliable to be greatly exceeded, more especially where coprolites are\r\nused, owing to the large amount of carbonate of lime they contain, which\r\nis also converted into sulphate by the action of the acid, so that it is\r\nfar from uncommon to find the gypsum twice as great as it would be if\r\nmaterials free from carbonates could be obtained. By employing a\r\nsufficiency of sulphuric acid, the whole quantity of phosphoric acid in\r\nthe bones may be thus brought into a soluble state, but in actual\r\npractice it is found preferable to leave part of it in the insoluble\r\ncondition; as where it is entirely soluble, its effect is too great\r\nduring the early part of the season, and deficient at its end. In order\r\nto dissolve bones, bone ash, or mineral phosphates, they are mixed with\r\nfrom a third to half their weight of sulphuric acid, of specific gravity\r\n1.70 or 140 deg. Twaddell. When mineral phosphates, and particularly\r\ncoprolites, are used, the quantity of sulphuric acid must be increased\r\nso as to compensate for the loss of that which is consumed in\r\ndecomposing the carbonate of lime they contain. When operating on the\r\nsmall scale, the materials are put into a vessel of wood, stone, or lead\r\n(iron is to be avoided, as it is rapidly corroded by the acid), and\r\nmixed with from a sixth to a fourth of their weight of water, which may\r\nwith advantage be used hot. The sulphuric acid is then added, and mixed\r\nas uniformly as possible with the bones. Considerable effervescence\r\ntakes place, and the mass becomes extremely hot. At the end of two or\r\nthree days it is turned over with the spade, and after standing for some\r\ndays longer, generally becomes pretty dry. Should it still be too moist\r\nto be sown, it must be again turned over, and mixed with some dry\r\nsubstance to absorb the moisture. For this purpose everything containing\r\nlime or its carbonate must be carefully avoided, as they bring back the\r\nphosphates into the insoluble state, and undo what the sulphuric acid\r\nhas done. Peat, saw-dust, sand, decaying leaves, or similar substances,\r\nwill answer the purpose, and they should all be made thoroughly dry\r\nbefore being used. An excellent plan is to sift the bones before\r\ndissolving, to apply the acid to the coarser part, and afterwards to mix\r\nin the fine dust which has passed through the sieve, to dry up the mass;\r\nor a small quantity of bone ash, of good quality, or Peruvian guano, may\r\nbe used. On the large scale, mechanical arrangements are employed for\r\nmixing the materials, so as to economise labour, and mineral phosphates,\r\nsuch as apatite, can then be used with advantage. In such cases, blood,\r\nsulphate of ammonia, soot, and other refuse matters, are occasionally\r\nused to supply the requisite quantity of nitrogenous substances, but\r\nlarge quantities are also made from bone ash, etc., without these\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nThe composition of superphosphates must necessarily vary to a great\r\nextent, and depends not only on the materials, but on the proportion of\r\nacid used for solution.

This is owing to the difficulty experienced in making the acid\r\nreact in a satisfactory manner on bones, the phosphates being protected\r\nfrom its action by the large quantity of animal matter which, when\r\nmoistened, swells up, fills the pores, and prevents the ready access of\r\nthe acid to the interior of the fragments. Superphosphates from\r\nbone-ash, on the other hand, contain a mere trifle of ammonia, and when\r\nwell made a very large quantity of biphosphate of lime. Their quality\r\ndiffers very greatly, and depends, of course, on that of the bone-ash\r\nemployed, which can rarely be obtained of quality sufficient to yield\r\nmore than 30 or 35 per cent of soluble phosphates. Coprolites are seldom\r\nused alone for the manufacture of superphosphates, but are generally\r\nmixed with bone-ash and bone dust. Mixtures containing salts of ammonia,\r\nflesh, blood, etc., are also largely manufactured, and some are now\r\nproduced containing as much as four or five per cent of ammonia, and the\r\nconsumption of such articles is largely increasing.\r\n\r\nThe analyses above given are all those of good superphosphates, in which\r\nabundance of acid has been used so as to convert a large proportion of\r\ninsoluble into soluble phosphates; but there are many samples of very\r\ninferior quality to be met with in the market, in which the proportion\r\nof acid has been reduced, and the quantity of phosphates made soluble is\r\nconsequently much lower than it ought to be. The following analyses\r\nillustrate the composition of such manures, which are all very inferior\r\nand generally worth much less than the price asked for them.\r\n\r\nWater                                   21.60           5.37          7.19\r\nOrganic matter and ammoniacal\r\n    salts,                              11.62          13.91          8.80\r\nBiphosphate of lime                      2.98           2.02          6.42\r\nEquivalent to soluble\r\n    phosphates                          (4.65)         (3.15)       (10.02)\r\nInsoluble phosphates                    25.70          15.80         14.03\r\nSulphate of lime                        23.66          47.52         51.93\r\nAlkaline salts                          10.70           3.73          3.43\r\nSand                                     3.80          11.65          8.20\r\n                                       ------         ------        ------\r\n                                       100.00         100.00        100.00\r\nAmmonia,                                 1.32           0.59          0.33\r\n\r\nThe deliberate adulteration of superphosphate, that is, the addition to\r\nit of sand or similar worthless materials, I believe to be but little\r\npractised. The most common fraud consists in selling as pure dissolved\r\nbones, articles made in part, and sometimes almost entirely, from\r\ncoprolites. Occasionally refuse matters are used, but less with the\r\nintention of actually diminishing the value of the manure as for the\r\npurpose of acting as driers. It is said that sulphate of lime is\r\nsometimes employed for this purpose, but this is rarely done, because\r\nthat substance is always a necessary constituent of superphosphate in\r\nvery large quantities; and as farmers look upon it with great suspicion,\r\nall the efforts of the manufacturers are directed towards reducing its\r\nquantity as much as possible. It is very commonly supposed by farmers\r\nthat the sulphate of lime found in so large quantity in all\r\nsuperphosphates, and often amounting to as much as fifty per cent, has\r\nbeen added to the materials in the process of manufacture, but this is a\r\nmistake; it is a necessary and inevitable product of the chemical action\r\nby which the phosphates are rendered soluble, although its quantity\r\ndepends on the materials from which the manure is made. When pure bones\r\nare used its quantity is small, and it does not greatly exceed twice\r\nthat of the biphosphate of lime; but in a manure made from coprolites,\r\nor other substances containing a large proportion of carbonate of lime,\r\nwhich must in the process of manufacture be converted into sulphate, it\r\nmay be four or five times as much.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no manure which varies more in quality, or requires\r\ngreater vigilance on the part of the purchaser, in order to obtain a\r\ngood article, there is no doubt that superphosphates, owing to the\r\nprocess of manufacture being better understood, and to increased\r\ncompetition, have considerably improved in quality. Six or eight years\r\nsince a manure containing thirty per cent of phosphates, of which twelve\r\nor fifteen had been converted into biphosphate, was considered a fair\r\nsample, but now the proportion rendered soluble is greatly increased;\r\nand where bone ash alone is employed, as much as thirty and even forty\r\nper cent of soluble phosphates is occasionally found. This, of course,\r\nis an exceptional case, and great attention and care in the selection of\r\nmaterials are necessary to obtain so large a proportion. The analyses\r\nalready given will shew the farmer what he has to expect in good\r\nsuperphosphates, but it is very necessary that he should take care to\r\nobtain from the manufacturer a manure equal to the guarantee; and he\r\nought to bear in mind that, owing to the difficulty of getting materials\r\nof constant composition, variations often take place to a considerable\r\nextent in manures which are supposed to be made in exactly the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_Phospho-Peruvian Guano._--Under this name a kind of superphosphate,\r\nwhich is understood to be made by dissolving a native \"rock guano,\" has\r\nrecently attracted considerable attention, and is used to a large\r\nextent. Its composition is--\r\n\r\nWater                                                   9.54\r\nOrganic matter                                         21.38\r\nBiphosphate of lime, equivalent to 25.22 soluble\r\n   phosphates                                          16.81\r\nInsoluble phosphates                                   10.88\r\nSulphate of lime                                       37.21\r\nAlkaline salts, containing 1.32 of phosphoric acid,\r\n   and equivalent to 2.86 soluble phosphates            2.22\r\nSand                                                    1.81\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                      100.00\r\nAmmonia,                                                3.50\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly distinguished by the large proportion of valuable\r\ningredients it contains, and the care taken to secure uniformity of\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA variety of substances are sold under the name of nitrophosphate,\r\npotato manure, cereal manure, etc. etc., which are all superphosphates,\r\ndiffering only in the proportion of their ingredients, and in the\r\naddition of small quantities of alkaline salts, sulphate of magnesia,\r\nand other substances, but they present little difference from ordinary\r\nsuperphosphates in their effects.\r\n\r\nThe use of superphosphate has greatly extended of late years, and its\r\nconsumption has increased in a greatly more rapid ratio than that of\r\nguano or any other manure. Ten or twelve years since it was\r\ncomparatively little known, but it has now come to be used in many cases\r\nin which Peruvian guano was formerly employed. It produces a better\r\neffect than that manure on light soils, although in general a mixture of\r\nthe two answers better than either separately. When Peruvian guano is\r\nto be applied along with it, the farmer will naturally select a\r\nsuperphosphate made from bone ash, and containing the largest obtainable\r\nquantity of soluble phosphates; but when it is to be used alone, it is\r\nadvisable to take one made from bones, or at all events one containing a\r\nconsiderable quantity of nitrogenous matter or ammonia. The kind to be\r\nselected must, however, be greatly dependent on the particular soil, and\r\nthe situation in which it is to be used.\r\n\r\n_Lime._--Lime is by far the most important of the mineral manures, and\r\nan almost indispensable agent of agricultural improvement. It has been\r\nused as chalk, marl, shell and coral sand, ground limestone, and as\r\nquick and slaked lime, and its action varies according as it is applied\r\nin any of its natural forms, or after being burnt. In all of its native\r\nforms the lime is combined with carbonic acid in the proportion of\r\nfifty-six parts of lime to forty-four of carbonic acid, and the\r\ncarbonate is generally mixed with variable quantities of earthy\r\ningredients, which in some instances are important additions to it, and\r\naffect its utility as a manure.\r\n\r\n_Chalk_ is a very pure form of carbonate of lime, and where it abounds\r\nhas been largely employed as an application on the soil. It is dug out\r\nof pits and exposed to the action of the winter's frost, by which it is\r\nthoroughly disintegrated, and in spring it is applied in quantities,\r\nwhich, in many instances, are only limited by the question of cost.\r\n\r\n_Marl_ is a name given to a mixture of finely-divided carbonate of lime,\r\nwith variable proportions of clay and siliceous matters, which is found\r\nat the bottom of valleys and in hollow places in beds often of\r\nconsiderable extent and thickness, where it is deposited from the waters\r\nof lakes holding lime in solution, fed by streams passing over\r\nlimestone, or rocks rich in lime. The composition of marls differs\r\ngreatly in different districts, and they have been divided into true\r\nmarls, and clay marls, according as the carbonate of lime or clay is the\r\npreponderating ingredient. The following table illustrates the\r\ncomposition of different varieties:--\r\n\r\n+---------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n|                           | Barbadoes. | Luneburg. | Ayrshire. | Wesermarsh.\r\n+---------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n| Carbonate of lime         |   93.2     |   85.4    |   8.4     |    8.2\r\n| Carbonate of magnesia     |    ...     |    1.3    |   ...     |    3.0\r\n| Sulphate of lime          |    ...     |    0.1    |   ...     |    0.5\r\n| Phosphate of lime         |    0.1     |    2.3    |   ...     |    1.2\r\n| Alumina and oxide of iron |    1.6     |    4.6    |   2.2     |    7.2\r\n| Alkaline salts            |    ...     |    0.1    |   ...     |    1.0\r\n| Silica and clay           |    4.6     |    5.6    |  84.9     |   78.9\r\n| Organic matter            |    0.5     |    0.6    |   2.8     |    ...\r\n| Water                     |    ...     |    ...    |   1.4     |    ...\r\n+---------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n|                           | 100.00     | 100.00    |  99.7     | 100.00\r\n+---------------------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe true marls, that is those in which carbonate of lime abounds, are\r\ngreatly preferable to clay marls, the latter, indeed, operate chiefly\r\nmechanically, by altering the texture of the soil--the lime they contain\r\nbeing frequently too small to exercise much appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nShell and coral sands consist chiefly of fragments of shells and coral\r\ndisintegrated by the action of the waves, and mixed with more or less\r\nsiliceous sand, and containing small quantities of phosphate of lime.\r\nThey occur to a considerable extent both on our own coasts and those of\r\nFrance, and have been used with good effect on some descriptions of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe general composition of limestones has been already adverted to,\r\nwhen treating of the origin of soils, and a distinction drawn between\r\nthe common limestones and dolomite or magnesium limestone. Few\r\nlimestones can be considered as even approaching to purity, and they\r\nalmost all contain a small quantity of carbonate of magnesia as well as\r\nearthy matters, and occasionally a little phosphate of lime. In good\r\nspecimens the quantities of these substances are generally small, and\r\nthey usually contain about half their weight of lime. When limestone is\r\nburnt in the kiln, the change which ensues consists in the expulsion of\r\nthe carbonic acid, and the consequent conversion of the lime into the\r\nuncombined or quick state. If water be thrown upon it when in this\r\ncondition, it becomes hot, swells up, and falls to a fine soft powder,\r\nand has then entered into combination with water. If it be exposed to\r\nthe air, the same action takes place, although, of course, more slowly;\r\nand if it be left for a sufficient time, it at length absorbs carbonic\r\nacid, and reverts to its original form of carbonate of lime, although\r\nnow in a state of very fine division.\r\n\r\nWhile lime may be applied in the state of carbonate, either as chalk,\r\nmarl, or pounded limestone, and with a certain amount of advantage, much\r\ngreater effects are obtained from the use of lime itself in the quick or\r\nslaked state. These advantages are dependent partly on the mechanical\r\neffect of the burning and slaking, which enable us to reduce the lime to\r\na much more minute state of division, and consequently to incorporate it\r\nmore uniformly and thoroughly with the soil, and partly on the more\r\npowerful chemical action which it exists when in the quick or caustic\r\nstate. Other minor advantages are also secured, such as the production\r\nof a certain quantity of sulphate of lime, produced by the oxidation of\r\nthe sulphur of the coal used in burning, etc., which, though\r\ncomparatively trifling, may, under particular circumstances and in some\r\nsoils, be of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThe action of lime is of a complicated character. Where the soil is\r\ndeficient in lime, it must necessarily act by supplying that substance\r\nto the plants growing in it. But this is manifestly a very subordinate\r\npart of its action,--_1st_, Because no soil exists which does not\r\ncontain lime in sufficient quantity to supply that element to the\r\nplants. _2d_, Because its effects are not restricted to those soils in\r\nwhich it exists naturally in small quantity; and, _3d_, Because it is\r\nfound that a small application, such as would suffice for the wants of\r\nthe crops, is not sufficient to produce its best effects.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact that the quantity of lime applied to the soil for\r\nagricultural purposes is very large, as much as ten, and even twenty\r\ntons per acre having been used, while the smallest application is\r\nexceedingly large when compared with the mere requirements of the crops.\r\nOf late years the very large applications once in use have become less\r\ncommon, as it has been found preferable to employ smaller doses more\r\nfrequently repeated. The quantity used depends, however, to a great\r\nextent, on the nature and condition of the soil, heavy clays, especially\r\nif undrained, and soils of a peaty nature, requiring a large\r\napplication; while on well drained and light soils a smaller quantity\r\nsuffices. Thin soils also require only a small application. The\r\ngeological origin of the soil is also not without its influence, and its\r\nbeneficial effect is peculiarly seen on granite, porphyry, and gneiss\r\nsoils, both because these are naturally deficient in lime, and because\r\nthe decompositions by which their valuable constituents are liberated\r\ntake place with extreme slowness.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the action of lime is unquestionably dependent on\r\nits exerting a chemical decomposition on the soil; and it acts equally\r\non both the great divisions of its constituents, the inorganic and the\r\norganic. On the former, it operates by decomposing the silicates, which\r\nform the main part of the soil, and the alkalies they contain being thus\r\nset free, a larger supply becomes available to the plant. On the organic\r\nconstituents its effects are principally expended in promoting the\r\ndecomposition which converts their nitrogen into ammonia; and thus a\r\nsupply of food, which might remain for a long period locked up, is set\r\nfree in a state in which the plant can at once absorb it. But these\r\nchemical decompositions are attended by a corresponding change in the\r\nmechanical characters of the soil. Heavy clays are observed to become\r\nlighter and more open in their texture; and those which are too rich in\r\norganic matter have it rapidly reduced in quantity, and the excessive\r\nlightness which it occasions diminished.\r\n\r\nThe effects of an application of lime are not generally observed\r\nimmediately, but become apparent in the course of one or two years, when\r\nit has had time to exert its chemical influence on the soil; but from\r\nthat time its effects are seen gradually to diminish and finally to\r\ncease entirely. The period within which this occurs necessarily varies\r\nwith the amount of the application and the nature of the soil, but it\r\nmay be said generally that lime will last from ten to fifteen years. The\r\ncessation of its effects is due to several circumstances, partly of\r\ncourse to the absorption of lime by the plants, partly to its being\r\nwashed out of the soil by the rains, and partly to its tendency to sink\r\nto a lower level, a tendency which most practical men have had\r\nopportunities of observing. In the latter case, deep-ploughing often\r\nproduces a marked effect, and sometimes makes it possible to postpone\r\nfor a year or two the reapplication of lime. All these circumstances\r\nhave their influence in bringing its action to an end, but the most\r\nimportant is, that after a time it has exhausted its decomposing effect\r\non the soil, having destroyed all the organic matter, or liberated all\r\nthe insoluble mineral substances which the quantity added is competent\r\nto do, and so the soil passes back to its old state. It does even more,\r\nfor unless active measures are taken to sustain it by other means, it is\r\nfound that the fertility of the soil is apt to become less than it was\r\nbefore the use of lime. And that it should be so is manifest, if we\r\nconsider that the lime added has liberated a quantity of inorganic\r\nmatter, which, in the natural state of the soil, would have become\r\nslowly available to the plant, and that it must have acted chiefly in\r\nthose very portions which, from having already undergone a partial\r\ndecomposition, were ready to pass into a state fitted for absorption,\r\nand thus as it were must have anticipated the supplies of future years.\r\nThis effect has been frequently observed by farmers, and is indeed so\r\ncommon, that it has passed into a proverbial saying, that \"lime enriches\r\nthe fathers and impoverishes the sons.\" But this is true only when the\r\nsoil is stinted of other manures, for when it is well manured the\r\nexhausting effect of lime is not observed; and it must be laid down as a\r\npractical rule, that its use necessitates a liberal treatment of the\r\nsoil in all other respects. But when lime has been once employed it\r\nbecomes almost necessary to resort to it again; and generally so soon as\r\nits effects are exhausted a new quantity is applied, not so large as\r\nthat which is used when the soil is first limed, but still considerable.\r\nWhen this is done very frequently, however, bad effects ensue; the soil\r\ngets into a particular state, in which it is so open that the grain\r\ncrops become uncertain, and such land is said, in practical language, to\r\nbe overlimed. The explanation of this state of matters commonly assumed\r\nby those unacquainted with chemistry is, that the land has become too\r\nfull of lime; but a moment's consideration of the very small fraction of\r\nthe soil which even the largest application of lime forms, will serve to\r\nshew that this cannot be the cause. Ten tons of lime per acre amounts to\r\nonly one per cent of the soil, and as a considerable part of the lime is\r\ncarried off by drainage in the course of years, it is obvious that even\r\nvery large and frequently repeated doses are not likely to produce any\r\ngreat accumulation of that substance. In point of fact, analyses of\r\noverlimed soils have proved that the lime does not exceed the ordinary\r\nquantity found in fertile land. The explanation of the phenomenon is\r\nprobably to be found in the rapid decomposition of organic matter by the\r\nlime, and its escape as carbonic acid, by which the soil is left in that\r\ncurious porous condition so well known in practice. The cure for\r\noverliming is found to be the employment of such means as consolidate\r\nthe soil, such as eating off with sheep, rolling, or laying down to\r\npermanent pasture.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of lime on the vegetation of the land to which it\r\nis applied is very striking. It immediately destroys all sorts of moss,\r\nmakes a tender herbage spring up, and eradicates a number of weeds. It\r\nimproves the quantity and quality of most crops, and causes them to\r\narrive more rapidly at maturity. The extent to which it produces these\r\neffects is dependent on the form in which it is applied. When the lime\r\nis used hot, that is, immediately after it has been slaked, they are\r\nproduced most rapidly and effectually; but if it has been so long\r\nexposed to the air as to absorb much of the carbonic acid it lost in\r\nburning, and has got into what is commonly called the mild state, it\r\noperates more slowly; and when it is applied as chalk, marl, or pounded\r\nlimestone, its action is still more tardy. Various circumstances, which\r\nmust depend upon very different considerations, must necessarily\r\ninfluence the farmer in the selection of one or other of these different\r\nforms of lime; but on the whole, it will be found that the greatest\r\nadvantages are on the side of the well-burned and freshly slaked lime.\r\nThe consideration of all the minutiae to be attended to, however, would\r\ncarry us far beyond the limits of this work, and trench to some extent\r\non the subject of practical agriculture.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of refuse matters containing lime have been used in\r\nagriculture, but they are generally inferior to good lime, and not\r\ngenerally more economical. The most important of these is gas lime, or\r\nlime which has been used for purifying coal gas. In going through this\r\nprocess it absorbs carbonic acid from the gas, and consequently passes\r\nback, more or less, completely into the form of carbonate of lime. But\r\nit also takes up sulphur, which remains in it in the form of sulphuret\r\nof calcium. It is well known that all sulphurets are prejudicial to\r\nvegetable life, and hence, when fresh gas lime is used, its effects are\r\noften injurious rather than beneficial. But if it be exposed for some\r\ntime to the air, oxygen is absorbed, the sulphur is converted into\r\nsulphuric acid, gypsum is produced to the extent of some per cent, and\r\nthe lime then becomes innocuous. When composted with dry soil, the\r\nadmission of air into the interior of the lime is facilitated, and this\r\nchange takes place with greater rapidity. The waste lime from\r\nbleach-works, tanneries, and other manufactories, is occasionally used\r\nby farmers; but unless obtained at a nominal price, it cannot compete\r\nwith good quick lime, owing to the large amount of water it contains,\r\nand the consequent increase in the cost of carriage.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime or Gypsum._--Gypsum has been extensively used as a\r\nmanure, and is found to exert a very remarkable influence upon clover,\r\nand leguminous crops generally. It is employed in quantities varying\r\nfrom two cwt. per acre up to a very large quantity, and almost\r\ninvariably with good results, in some instances even with the production\r\nof double crops. Much speculation has taken place as to the cause of\r\nthis action which is so specific in its character, and from Sir Humphrey\r\nDavy down to the present time, many chemists and agriculturists have\r\nconsidered the matter. Sir Humphrey Davy attributed its action to its\r\nsupplying sulphur to those plants which, according to him, contain an\r\nunusually large quantity of that element. That opinion has been since\r\nentertained by others, but it can scarcely be considered as well\r\nfounded, for the more accurate experiments recently made do not point to\r\nany conspicuous differences between the quantities of sulphur contained\r\nin these and other plants. It is, moreover, to gypsum alone that these\r\neffects are due, and if it were merely as a source of sulphur that it\r\nwas employed, there are other salts which could be equally, perhaps more\r\nadvantageously, used; such, for instance, as sulphate of soda. Others\r\nhave attributed its action to its power of fixing ammonia, but this\r\nexplanation is certainly untenable, for the soil itself possesses this\r\nproperty very powerfully, and it is inconceivable that the addition of a\r\nfew hundred weights of gypsum should have any effect in promoting this\r\naction. The experiments which have been made with gypsum leave no doubt\r\nas to its effect, more especially on leguminous plants, but they do not\r\nafford an explanation of its mode of action, for which further\r\ninquiries, directed especially to that object, are required.\r\n\r\nThe application of gypsum to the soil appears to have diminished of late\r\nyears, and this is probably due to the large consumption of\r\nsuperphosphates, and other manufactured manures, which contain it in\r\nabundance. In an ordinary application of these substances, there are\r\ncontained from one to two hundredweight of gypsum; and it is not likely\r\nthat when they have been extensively used, much benefit will be derived\r\nfrom a further application of it by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUATION OF MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe determination of the value of a manure is in many respects a\r\ncommercial rather than a chemical question, but as it must be founded on\r\nthe analysis, and presents some peculiarities dependent on the\r\ncomplicated nature of the substances to be valued, it has fallen to some\r\nextent into the hands of the chemist. The principle on which the value\r\nof any commercial sample is estimated is very simple. It is only\r\nnecessary to know the price of the pure article, and that of the\r\nparticular sample to be valued is obtained by making a deduction from\r\nthis price proportionate to the per centage of impurities shewn by the\r\nanalysis. Thus, for example, if pure sulphate of ammonia sells at L16\r\nper ton, a sample containing 10 per cent of impurities ought to be\r\npurchased for L14: 8s., and so on for any other quantity. This system\r\nwhich answers perfectly with sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda, or\r\nany other substance whose value depends on one individual element, is\r\ninapplicable in the case of complex manures, such as guano and the like,\r\nin which several factors combine to make up the value. In such cases,\r\nmanures of very different composition may have the same value, the\r\ndeficiency in one particular element being counterbalanced by the excess\r\nof another. Hence it becomes necessary to obtain an estimate of the\r\nvalue of each factor, from which that not only of one particular\r\nsubstance, but of every possible mixture may be determined.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to inquire minutely into this question, it appears that the\r\ncommercial value of any substance is not estimated solely by\r\nconsiderations of composition, but is dependent to a great extent on\r\nquestions of demand and supply, and applicability to particular\r\npurposes. Thus coprolites containing from 55 to 60 per cent of\r\nphosphates sell at about L2: 12s. per ton, while bone-ash containing the\r\nsame quantity of that ingredient brings about twice as much; in other\r\nwords, phosphates are nearly twice as valuable in bone-ash as in\r\ncoprolites, and as a phosphatic guano their price is generally still\r\nhigher; and the reason for this is obvious, in bones and guano the\r\nphosphates are in a high state of division, in which they are easily\r\nattacked and disintegrated by the carbonic acid of the soil, and\r\nrendered available to plants; while in coprolites they are in a hard and\r\ncompact form, and are of little use unless they have previously\r\nundergone an expensive preparation. In the same way, if the market price\r\nof different kinds of guano be inquired into, very great differences are\r\nfound to exist in the rate at which phosphates are sold, and this is\r\nattributable in part to the fact that the price at which any article is\r\ncharged commercially, is such as to cover the prime cost, expense of\r\nfreight, and other charges, and to leave a profit to the importer; and\r\npartly, also, no doubt, to the carelessness with which manures are often\r\npurchased, and to the want of careful field experiments in which the\r\neffects produced by them are properly compared. It will be readily\r\nunderstood that the state of division of any substance, the readiness\r\nwith which its constituents can be rendered available to the plants,\r\ncare of application, and many other circumstances must influence its\r\nprice; but making due allowance for these, differences are met with\r\nwhich appear to some extent to be merely the result of caprice. It is\r\neasy to understand why bone-ash should sell at double the price of\r\ncoprolites, but no good reason can be shewn why the phosphates in one\r\nkind of guano should be sold at a much higher price than another, and\r\nthe difference would probably disappear if greater attention were paid\r\nto the results of field experiments.\r\n\r\nHowever great and inexplicable these differences may be, it is not the\r\nbusiness of the valuator of a manure to discuss them. On the contrary,\r\nhe is bound to accept them as the basis of his calculation, and to\r\nendeavour to deduce from them a proper system of estimation for each\r\nsubstance. Strictly speaking, each individual manure ought to be valued\r\naccording to a plan special to itself, and deduced from its own standard\r\nmarket price; but it is obvious that this would lead to innumerable\r\ncomplications and defeat its own ends, and hence an attempt has been\r\nmade to contrive a general system suited to all manures, and which,\r\nthough not absolutely correct, is a sufficient approximation for all\r\npractical purposes, and a tolerably accurate guide to the determination\r\nof their relative values.\r\n\r\nThe constituents of a manure which are of actual value are ammonia,\r\ninsoluble phosphates, biphosphate of lime (soluble phosphates), sulphate\r\nof lime, nitric acid (as nitrate of soda), potash, soda, and organic\r\nmatter. These substances differ greatly in value. Ammonia and\r\nphosphates, soluble and insoluble, are costly; and by far the larger\r\npart of the value of all guanos, and the common manufactured manures,\r\ndepends on them. Nitric acid and potash are also very valuable\r\nsubstances, but as they are rarely found in manufactured manures, and\r\nnever in sufficient quantity to exert any material influence in their\r\nprice, it is not usual to take them into consideration except in\r\nparticular cases. The alkali which commonly exists in artificial manures\r\nis soda, and when alkaline salts appear in any analysis, they must be\r\nassumed to consist almost entirely of that substance generally in the\r\nform of common salt, and be valued accordingly. Sulphate of lime and\r\norganic matter though abundant constituents of most manures, add but\r\nlittle to their value, and it is a moot point whether they ought to be\r\ntaken into consideration, although most persons allow a small value for\r\nthem. Carbonate of lime, sand, or siliceous matter, and water, of\r\ncourse, are altogether worthless.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the value of a manure containing several of these\r\nsubstances, it is necessary to ascertain the average commercial price of\r\neach individually. This is easily done when they are met with in\r\ncommerce separately, or at least mixed only with worthless substances,\r\nbut some of them are only found in complex mixtures, and in these cases\r\nit is necessary to arrive at a result by an indirect process, according\r\nto methods which will be immediately explained. The question to be\r\nsolved is the price actually paid for a ton of each substance in a pure\r\nstate, and we shall proceed to consider them in succession.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble Phosphates._--These are purchased alone, chiefly in the form\r\nof coprolites and bone-ash, or the spent animal charcoal of the sugar\r\nrefiners. Ground coprolites, containing about 58 per cent of phosphates,\r\nsell at L2: 12s. per ton, which is at the rate of L4: 8s. for pure\r\nphosphates. Bone-ash varies considerably in price, but of late samples\r\ncontaining 70 per cent of phosphates have sold as low as L4: 10s. per\r\nton, and consequently pure phosphates in this form are worth L6: 8s. per\r\nton. Although these are the only forms in which phosphates are\r\npurchased alone, it is possible to determine the price at which they are\r\nsold in bones and phosphatic guanos, by first deducting the value of the\r\nammonia they contain, and assuming the remainder to represent the price\r\npaid for the phosphates. In this way we find the following values for\r\ninsoluble phosphates:--\r\n\r\nIn Coprolites          L4 10  0\r\n   Bone-ash             6  8  0\r\n   Bones                7  5  0\r\n   Phosphatic guanos   10  0  0\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that these are actual prices, and they are liable\r\nto fluctuate with the state of the market, although they are pretty fair\r\naverages. It is important to notice how much they vary in the different\r\nforms; the farmer who buys a phosphatic guano paying for phosphates a\r\nmuch higher price than he could have obtained those for in other\r\nsubstances--a difference which must be attributed to the high state of\r\ndivision in which they exist in the guano. We do not here enter upon the\r\nquestion how far this difference in price is justified; we are content\r\nwith the fact that it exists, and we are compelled to estimate the value\r\nof phosphates in a phosphatic guano at the price given above, although\r\nin Peruvian guano they are sold at a lower rate. For all other manures,\r\nof which bones and bone-ash form the basis, L7 may be taken as a fair\r\nprice, and it is that usually adopted, though L8 and L10 have sometimes\r\nbeen assumed as the average.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia_ is met with in commerce as muriate and sulphate of ammonia.\r\nThe former, owing to its high price, is practically excluded from use as\r\na manure; the latter sells at present at from L15 to L15: 10s. per ton,\r\nand, making allowance for the usual amount of impurity (5 or 6 per\r\ncent), the actual ammonia is worth about L63 per ton. Calculating from\r\nother substances it appears that ammonia is worth, per ton, in--\r\n\r\nSulphate of ammonia    L63 0 0\r\nBones                   61 0 0\r\nPeruvian guano          57 0 0\r\n\r\nthe average being L60, which is the price usually adopted.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime_ and _Alkaline Salts_ (consisting chiefly of soda) are\r\ngenerally estimated at Ll per ton; and potash in those cases, in which\r\nit is necessary to take it into account, is usually valued at from L20\r\nto L30 per ton, the former being its value in kelp, the form in which it\r\ncan be most cheaply purchased.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Soda_ is usually sold at from L15 to L15: 10s. per ton, and,\r\nmaking allowance for impurities, L16 may be taken as the value of the\r\npure salt.\r\n\r\n_Biphosphate of Lime, Soluble Phosphates._--Considerable difficulty is\r\nexperienced in estimating the value of these substances, because they\r\nare not met with in commerce alone, or in any form except that of\r\nsuperphosphate, and the prices at which they are sold in different\r\nsamples of that manure differ excessively. The only course by which any\r\nresult can be obtained, is to determine the average price of a good\r\nsuperphosphate, and putting the values already ascertained on all the\r\nother constituents to reckon the difference between that sum and the\r\nmarket price as the value of soluble phosphates. Throwing out, as\r\ninferior, all samples containing less than 10 per cent of soluble\r\nphosphates, and taking the good only, I find that the average\r\ncomposition of the phosphates in the market during the present year has\r\nbeen--\r\n\r\nWater                                    10.71\r\nOrganic matter                            9.33\r\nBiphosphate of lime equivalent to 19.43\r\n    \"soluble phosphates\"                 12.45\r\nInsoluble phosphates                     14.78\r\nSulphate of lime                         45.24\r\nAlkaline salts                            2.11\r\nSand                                      5.38\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100.00\r\nAmmonia                                   1.71\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to fix the average price of superphosphate, as in\r\nmany cases no information could be obtained on this point; but among\r\nthose analyzed were samples at all prices, from L7 up to L10: 10s. per\r\nton, so that on the whole, L8 may be assumed as an average, and in that\r\ncase soluble phosphates are worth L27: 19s. per ton. Had the inferior\r\nsamples been included, the price would have been higher, and in fact the\r\nrate at which soluble phosphates have been commonly estimated is L30 per\r\nton, or L46: 16s. for biphosphate of lime, although sometimes the former\r\nhave been reckoned as low as L25, with a corresponding rate for the\r\nlatter. It is important that biphosphate of lime and soluble phosphates\r\nshould not be confounded with one another in valuing a manure, the\r\nlatter having one and a half times the value of the former.\r\n\r\nAs manures are liable to considerable fluctuations in price, the value\r\nattached to each of their constituents ought to be varied with the state\r\nof the market; but it is obviously impossible for the farmer to watch\r\nthe changes in price with such minuteness as to enable him to do this,\r\nand it is much more convenient, as well as safer, to adopt a fixed\r\naverage, which can be used with reasonable accuracy at all times. The\r\nfact is, that this system of valuation is only an approximation to the\r\ntruth; and if absolute accuracy were aimed at, it would be necessary to\r\nvary the estimates, not only at different times, but at different\r\nlocalities at the same time, and to some extent also according to the\r\nkind of manure. The price of soluble phosphates more especially,\r\nfluctuates to a great extent, being practically fixed by each\r\nmanufacturer according to the facilities which his position or command\r\nof raw material offer for producing them at a low rate. We thus find\r\nthat when made from bones alone, the cost of that substance is not\r\nunfrequently as high as L40 per ton, and when bone-ash alone is used it\r\nis sometimes as low as L20. Such extreme differences, of course, cannot\r\nbe taken into account in the system of valuation adopted, where all that\r\ncan be done is to take average values, which, when applied to average\r\nsamples, ought to bring out their value.\r\n\r\nThe data which have already been given regarding the price of the\r\nindividual constituents of manures can be applied to the determination\r\nof the value of any mixture in two different ways by means of the\r\nsubjoined table:--\r\n\r\n+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+\r\n|                            | Price per Ton.  | Per cent per Ton. |\r\n+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+\r\n| Ammonia                    | L60  0  0       | L0 12  0          |\r\n| Insoluble phosphates       |   7  0  0       |  0  1  5          |\r\n|   Do. in phosphatic guanos |  10  0  0       |  0  2  0          |\r\n| Soluble phosphates         |  30  0  0       |  0  6  0          |\r\n| Biphosphate of lime        |  46 16  0       |  0  9  4-1/2      |\r\n| Alkaline salts             |   1  0  0       |  0  0  2-4/10     |\r\n| Sulphate of lime           |   1  0  0       |  0  0  2-4/10     |\r\n| Potash                     |  20  0  0       |  0  4  0          |\r\n| Nitrate of soda            |  16  0  0       |  0  3  2-1/2      |\r\n| Organic matter             |   0 10  0       |  0  0  1-1/4      |\r\n+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\nSupposing it be desired to calculate the value of a manure by the first\r\ncolumn, it is obvious that if we suppose 100 tons to be purchased, the\r\nper centages of the different constituents shewn in the analysis will\r\ngive the number of tons of each contained in 100 tons of the mixture,\r\nand, selecting the analysis of the superphosphate given in a previous\r\npage, we proceed in the calculation as follows:--\r\n\r\n14.11 tons of organic matter at 10s.

It will be obvious to\r\nevery one who tries the two methods that the first greatly exceeds the\r\nsecond in convenience and simplicity in the calculations, and it is that\r\nmost commonly in use, although some persons prefer the second.\r\n\r\nAlthough the data just given must always form the basis of the valuation\r\nof any manure, there are a variety of other circumstances which must be\r\ntaken into account, and which give great scope for the judgment and\r\nexperience of the valuator. Of these the most important is the proper\r\nadmixture of the ingredients, and the condition of the manure as regards\r\ndryness, complete reduction to the pulverulent state, and the like. A\r\ncertain allowance ought always to be made for careful manufacture; and,\r\non the other hand, where the manure is damp or ill reduced, a small\r\ndeduction (the amount of which must be decided by the experience of the\r\nvaluator) ought to be made on account of the risk which the farmer runs\r\nof loss from unequal distribution, and the extra cost of carriage of an\r\nunnecessary quantity of water.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to take into account the particular element\r\nrequired by the soil. Thus, a farmer who finds his soil wants\r\nphosphates, will look to the manure containing the largest quantity of\r\nthat substance, and possibly not requiring ammonia, will not care to\r\nestimate at its full value any quantity of that substance which he may\r\nbe compelled to take along with the former, but will look only to the\r\nsource from which he can obtain it most cheaply. It may be well,\r\ntherefore, to point out that ammonia is most cheaply purchased in\r\nPeruvian guano; insoluble phosphates in coprolites; and soluble\r\nphosphates in superphosphates, made from bone-ash alone. In general,\r\nhowever, it will be found most advantageous to select manures in which\r\nthe constituents are properly adjusted to one another, so that neither\r\nammonia, soluble nor insoluble phosphates, preponderate; but, of course,\r\nit must frequently happen that it will prove more economical to buy the\r\nsubstances separately and to make the mixture, than to take the manure\r\nin which they are ready mixed.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the value of any manure, it is also important to make sure\r\nthat the analysis which forms the basis of the calculation is that of a\r\nfair sample, which correctly represents the bulk actually delivered to\r\nthe purchaser, and not one which has been made to do duty for an\r\nunlimited quantity of manure, which is supposed to be all of equal\r\nquality, as often happens in the hands of careless manufacturers, and\r\ntoo great attention cannot be devoted to the selection of the sample,\r\nwhich is very often done in an exceedingly slovenly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ROTATION OF CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has already been more than once made to the fact that a crop\r\ngrowing in any soil must necessarily exhaust it to a greater or less\r\nextent by withdrawing from it a certain quantity of the elements to\r\nwhich its fertility is due. That this is the case has been long admitted\r\nin practice, and it has also been established that the exhausting\r\neffects of different species of plants are very different; that while\r\nsome rapidly impoverish the soil, others may be cultivated for a number\r\nof years without material injury, and some even _apparently_ improve it.\r\nThus, it is a notorious fact that white crops exhaust, while grass\r\nimproves the soil; but the improvement in the latter case is really\r\ndependent on the fact, that when the land is laid down in pasture,\r\nnothing is removed from it, the cattle which feed on its produce\r\nrestoring all but a minute fraction of the mineral matters contained in\r\ntheir food; and as the plants derive a part, and in some instances a\r\nvery large part, of their organic constituents from the air, the\r\nfertility of the soil must manifestly be increased, or at all events\r\nmaintained in its previous state. When, however, the plant, or any\r\nportion of it, is removed from the soil, there must be a reduction of\r\nfertility dependent on the quantity of valuable matters withdrawn by it;\r\nand thus it happens that when a plant has grown on any soil, and has\r\nremoved from it a large quantity of nutritive matters, it becomes\r\nincapable of producing an equally large crop of the same species; and if\r\nthe attempt be made to grow it in successive years, the land becomes\r\nincapable of producing it at all, and is then said to be thoroughly\r\nexhausted. But if the exhausted land be allowed to lie for some time\r\nwithout a crop, it regains its fertility more or less rapidly according\r\nto circumstances, and again produces the same plant in remunerative\r\nquantity. The observation of this fact led to the introduction of naked\r\nfallows, which, up to a comparatively recent period, were an essential\r\nfeature in agriculture. But after a time it was observed that the land\r\nwhich had been exhausted by successive crops of one species was not\r\nabsolutely barren, but was still capable of producing a luxuriant growth\r\nof other plants. Thus peas, beans, clover, or potatoes, could be\r\ncultivated with success on land which would no longer sustain a crop of\r\ngrain, and these plants came into use in place of the naked fallow under\r\nthe name of fallow crops. On this was founded the rotation of crops; for\r\nit was clear that a judicious interchange of the plants grown might\r\nenable the soil to regain its fertility for one crop at the time when it\r\nwas producing another; and when exhausted for the second, it might be\r\nagain ready to bear crops of the first.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a rotation of crops has been explained in several\r\nways. The oldest view is that of Decandolle, who founded his theory on\r\nthe fact that the plants excrete certain substances from their roots. He\r\nfound that when plants are grown in water, a peculiar matter is thrown\r\noff by the roots; and he believed that this extrementitious substance is\r\neliminated _because_ it is injurious to the plant, and that, remaining\r\nin the soil, it acts as a poison to those of the same species, and so\r\nprevents the growth of another crop. But this excretion, though\r\npoisonous to the plants from which it is excreted, he believed to be\r\nnutritive to those of another species which is thus enabled to grow\r\nluxuriantly where the others failed. Nothing can be more simple than\r\nthis explanation, and it was readily embraced at the time it was\r\npropounded and considered fully satisfactory. But when more minutely\r\nexamined, it becomes apparent that the facts on which it is founded are\r\nof a very uncertain character. Decandolle's observations regarding the\r\nradical excretions of plants have not been confirmed by subsequent\r\nobservers. On the contrary, it has been shewn that though some plants,\r\nwhen growing in water, do excrete a particular substance in small\r\nquantity, nothing of the sort appears when they are grown in a siliceous\r\nsand. And hence the inference is, that the peculiar excretion of plants\r\ngrowing in water is to be viewed as the result of the abnormal method of\r\ntheir growth rather than as a natural product of vegetation. But even\r\nadmitting the existence of these matters, it would be impossible to\r\naccept the explanation founded upon them, because it is a familiar fact\r\nthat, on some soils, the repeated growth of particular crops is\r\nperfectly possible, as, for instance, on the virgin soils of America,\r\nfrom which many successive crops of wheat have been taken; and in these\r\ncases the alleged excretion must have taken place without producing any\r\ndeleterious effect on the crop. Besides, it is in the last degree\r\nimprobable that these excretions, consisting of soluble organic matters,\r\nshould remain in the soil without undergoing decomposition, as all\r\nsimilar substances do; and even if they did, we cannot, with our present\r\nknowledge of the food of plants, admit the possibility of the direct\r\nabsorption of any organic substance whatever. Indeed, the idea of\r\nradical excretions, as an explanation of the rotation of crops, must be\r\nconsidered as being entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a rotation of crops is now generally attributed to the\r\ndifferent quantities of valuable matters which different plants remove\r\nfrom the soil, and more especially to their mineral constituents. It has\r\nbeen already observed that great differences exist in the composition of\r\nthe ash of different plants in the section on that subject; and it was\r\nstated that a distinction has been made between lime, potash, and silica\r\nplants, according as one or other of these elements preponderate in\r\ntheir ashes. The remarkable difference in the proportion of these\r\nelements has been supposed to afford an explanation of rotation. It is\r\nsupposed that if a plant requiring a large quantity of any one element,\r\npotash, for example, be grown during a succession of years on the same\r\nsoil, it will sooner or later exhaust all, or nearly all, the potash\r\nthat soil contains in an _available_ form, and it will consequently\r\ncease to produce a luxuriant crop. But if this plant be replaced by\r\nanother which requires only a small quantity of potash and a large\r\nquantity of lime, it will flourish, because it finds what is necessary\r\nto its growth. In the meantime, the changes which are proceeding in the\r\nsoil, are liberating new quantities of the inorganic matters from those\r\nforms of combination in which they are not immediately available, and\r\nwhen after a time the plant which requires potash is again sown on the\r\nsoil, it finds a sufficient quantity to serve its purpose. We have\r\nalready, in treating of the ashes of plants, pointed out the extent of\r\nthe differences which exist; but these will be made more obvious by the\r\nannexed table, giving the quantity of the different mineral matters\r\ncontained in the produce of an imperial acre of the different crops.\r\n\r\nTABLE shewing the quantities of Mineral Matters and Nitrogen in average\r\nCrops of the

importance; and the quantity of\r\nnitrogen, which is of great moment in estimating the exhaustive effects\r\nof various crops, has been added.\r\n\r\nIn examining this table, it becomes apparent that while in regard to\r\nsome of the elements, the quantities removed by different crops do not\r\ndiffer to any marked extent, in others the variation is very great. The\r\ncereals and grasses are especially distinguished by the larger quantity\r\nof silica they contain, and the exhaustive effect consequent upon the\r\nremoval of both grain and straw from soils which contain but a limited\r\nsupply of that substance in an available condition is obvious. It is\r\nclear that under such circumstances the frequent repetition of a cereal\r\ncrop may so far diminish the amount of available silica as to render its\r\ncultivation impossible, although the other substances may be present in\r\nsufficient quantity to produce a plentiful crop of any plant which does\r\nnot require that element. Beans and peas, turnips and hay, on the other\r\nhand, require a very large quantity of alkalies, and especially of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nLooking more minutely, however, into this matter, certain points attract\r\nattention which appear to be at variance with commonly received\r\nopinions. With the exception of silica, for example, the cereals do not\r\nwithdraw from the soil so large a quantity of mineral matters as some of\r\nthe so-called fallow crops, and if their straw be returned to the soil\r\nthey are by far the least exhaustive of all cultivated plants; and we\r\nthus recognise the justice of that practical rule, which lays it down as\r\nan essential point of good husbandry that the straw ought, as far as\r\npossible, to be consumed on the farm on which it is produced. As regards\r\nthe general constituents of the ash, it is also to be remarked that\r\nthough differences in their proportions exist, they are by no means so\r\nmarked as might be expected; thus there are no plants for which a large\r\nquantity of potash, nitrogen, and phosphoric acid is not required; and\r\nit is not very easy to see how the substitution of the one for the other\r\nshould be of much importance in this respect. Indeed, the more minutely\r\nthe subject is examined, the more do we become convinced of the\r\ninsufficiency of that view which attributes the necessity for a rotation\r\nof crops to differences in chemical composition alone. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the nature of the plant and the particular mode in which it\r\ngathers its nutriment, have a most important influence. Certain plants\r\nare almost entirely dependent on the soil for their organic\r\nconstituents, while others derive a large proportion of them from the\r\nair, and a plant of the latter class will flourish in a soil in which\r\none of the former is incapable of growing. In other cases, the structure\r\nand distribution of the roots is the cause of the difference. Some\r\nplants have roots distributed near the surface and exhaust the\r\nsuperficial layer of the soil, others penetrate into the deeper layers,\r\nand not only derive an abundant supply of food from them, but actually\r\npromote the fertility of the surface soil by the refuse portions of them\r\nwhich are left upon it. Experience has in this respect arrived at\r\nresults which tally with theory, and it is for this reason that the\r\nbroad-leafed turnip, which obtains a considerable quantity of its\r\nnutriment from the air, alternates with grain crops which are chiefly\r\ndependent on the soil. It is undoubtedly to some such cause that several\r\nremarkable instances of what may be called natural rotations are to be\r\nattributed. It is well known in Sweden that when a pine forest is\r\nfelled, a growth, not of pine but of birch, immediately springs up. Now\r\nthe difference in composition of the ash of these trees is not\r\nsufficient to explain this fact, and it must clearly be due to some\r\ndifference in the distribution of their roots, or the mode in which they\r\nobtain their food.\r\n\r\nWhatever weight may be given to these different explanations of\r\nrotation, there is no doubt about the importance of attending to it, and\r\nthere are various practical deductions of much importance to be drawn\r\nfrom the facts with which we are acquainted. Thus it is to be observed\r\nthat the quantities of mineral matters withdrawn by plants of the same\r\nclass are generally similar, and hence it may be inferred that crops of\r\nthe most opposite class ought as much as possible to alternate with one\r\nanother, and each plant should be repeated as seldom as possible, so\r\nthat, even when it is necessary to return to the same class, a different\r\nmember of it should be employed. Thus, for instance, in place of\r\nimmediately repeating wheat, when another grain crop is necessary, it\r\nwould theoretically be preferable to employ oats or barley, and to\r\nreplace the turnip by mangold-wurzel or some other root. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that this system cannot be carried out in practice to its full\r\nextent; for the superior value of individual crops causes the more\r\nfrequent repetition of those which make the largest return. But\r\nexperience has so far concurred with theory that it has taught the\r\nfarmer the advantage of long rotations; and we have seen the successive\r\nintroduction of the three, four, five, and six-course shift, and even,\r\nin some instances, of longer periods.\r\n\r\nSuch is the theory of rotation, and while it will always be most\r\nadvantageous to adhere to it, it is by no means necessary that this\r\nshould be done in an absolutely rigid manner. In the practice of\r\nagriculture, plants are placed in artificial circumstances, and instead\r\nof allowing them to depend entirely on the soil, they are supplied with\r\na quantity of manure containing all the elements they require, and if it\r\nbe used in sufficiently large quantity, the same crop may be grown year\r\nafter year. And accordingly the order of rotation, which is\r\ntheoretically the best, may be, and every day is, violated in practice,\r\nalthough this must necessarily be done at the expense of a certain\r\nquantity of the valuable matters of the manure added, and is so far a\r\npractice which ought theoretically to be avoided. In actual practice,\r\nhowever, the matter is to be decided on other grounds. The object then\r\nis, not to produce the largest crops, but those which make the largest\r\nmoney return, and thus it may be practically economical to grow a crop\r\nof high commercial value more frequently than is theoretically\r\nadvantageous. In such cases the farmer must seek to do away as far as\r\npossible with the disadvantages which such a course entails, and this he\r\nwill endeavour to accomplish by careful management and a liberal\r\ntreatment of the soil.\r\n\r\nBut while this system may be adopted to some extent, it must also be\r\nborne in mind that the frequent repetition of some crops cannot be\r\npractised with impunity, for plants are liable to certain diseases which\r\nmanifest themselves to the greatest extent when they have been too often\r\ncultivated in the same soil. Clover sickness, which affects the plant\r\nwhen frequently repeated on light soils, and the potatoe disease and\r\nfinger and toe have been attributed to the same cause. Whether this is\r\nthe sole origin of these diseases is questionable, but there is no doubt\r\nthat they are aggravated by frequent repetition, and hence a strong\r\nargument in favour of rotation. It has been asserted by great\r\nauthorities in high farming, that with our present command of manures,\r\nrotations may be done away with; but this is an opinion to which science\r\ngives no countenance, and he would be a rash man who attempted to carry\r\nit out in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FEEDING OF FARM STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feeding of cattle, once a subordinate part of the operations of the\r\nfarm, has now become one of its most important departments, and a large\r\nnumber of minute and elaborate experiments have been made by chemists\r\nand physiologists with the view of determining the principles on which\r\nits successful and economical practice depends. These investigations,\r\nwhile they have thrown much light on the matter, have by no means\r\nexhausted it, and it will be readily understood that the complete\r\nelucidation of a subject of such complexity, touching on so many of the\r\nmost abstruse and difficult problems of chemistry and physiology, and in\r\nwhich the experiments are liable to be affected by disturbing causes,\r\ndependent on peculiarities of constitution of different animals, cannot\r\nbe otherwise than a slow process.\r\n\r\nIn considering the principles of feeding, it is necessary to point out,\r\nin the first instance, that the plant and animal are composed of the\r\nsame chemical elements, hence the food supplied to the latter invariably\r\ncontains all the substances it requires for the maintenance of its\r\nfunctions. And not only is this the case, but these elements are to a\r\ngreat extent combined together in a similar manner,--the fibrine,\r\ncaseine, albumen, and fatty matters contained in animals corresponding\r\nin all respects with the compounds extracted from plants under the same\r\nname; and though the starchy and saccharine substances do not form any\r\npart of the animal body, they are represented in the milk, the food\r\nwhich nature has provided for the young animal. It has been frequently\r\nassumed that the nitrogenous and fatty matters are simply absorbed into\r\nthe animal system, and deposited unchanged in its tissues; but it is\r\nprobable that the course of events is not quite so simple, although,\r\ndoubtless, the decomposition which occurs is comparatively trifling. The\r\nstarchy matters, on the other hand, are completely changed, and devoted\r\nto purposes which will be immediately explained.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of familiar experience, that if the food be properly\r\nproportioned to the requirements of the animal, its weight remains\r\nunchanged; and the inference to be drawn from this fact obviously is,\r\nthat the food does not remain permanently in the system, but must be\r\nagain got rid of. It escapes partly through the lungs, and partly by the\r\nexcretions, which do not consist merely of the part which has not been\r\ndigested, but also of that portion which has been absorbed, and after\r\nperforming its allotted functions within the system, has become effete\r\nand useless. When the weights of the excretions, the carbon contained in\r\nthe carbonic acid expired by the lungs and the small quantity of matter\r\nwhich escapes in the form of perspiration, are added together, they are\r\nfound in such a case to be exactly equal to the food. If the animal be\r\ndeprived of nutriment, it immediately begins to lose weight, because its\r\nfunctions must continue--carbon must still be converted into carbonic\r\nacid to maintain respiration--and the excretions be eliminated, although\r\ndiminished in quantity, because they no longer contain the undigested\r\nportion of the daily food, and the substances already stored up in the\r\nbody are consumed to maintain the functions of life. Universal\r\nexperience has shewn that, under such circumstances, the fat which has\r\naccumulated in various parts of the body disappears, and the animal\r\nbecomes lean; but it is less generally recognised that the muscular\r\nflesh, that is the lean part of the body, also diminishes, although it\r\nis sufficiently indicated by the fact that nitrogen still continues to\r\nbe found in the urine, and that the animal becomes feeble and incapable\r\nof muscular exertion. Respiration and secretion, in fact, proceed quite\r\nirrespective of the food, which is only required to repair the loss they\r\noccasion. When the course of events within the animal body is traced, it\r\nis found to be somewhat as follows: The food consumed is digested and\r\nabsorbed into the blood, where it undergoes a series of complicated\r\nchanges, as a consequence of which part of it is converted into carbonic\r\nacid, and eliminated by the lungs, and part is deposited in the tissues\r\nas fat and flesh. After the lapse of a certain period, longer or shorter\r\naccording to circumstances, a new set of actions comes into play, by\r\nwhich the complex constituents of the tissues are resolved into simpler\r\nsubstances, and excreted chiefly by the lungs and kidneys. The changes\r\nthus produced are, to a great extent, identical with those which would\r\ntake place if the fat and flesh were consumed in a fire; and the animal\r\nframe may, in a certain sense, be compared to a furnace, in which, by\r\nthe daily consumption of a certain quantity of fuel and air inhaled in\r\nthe process of respiration, its temperature is maintained above that of\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere. If the daily supply of fuel, that is of\r\nfood, be properly adjusted to the loss by combustion, the weight of the\r\nanimal remains constant; if it be reduced below this quantity, it\r\ndiminishes; but if it be increased, the stomach either refuses to\r\ndigest and assimilate the excess, or it is absorbed and stored up in the\r\nbody, increasing both the fat and flesh.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is fed in such a manner that its weight remains constant,\r\na balance is produced between the supply of nutriment contained in the\r\nfood and the waste of the tissues, the gain from the former exactly\r\ncounterpoising the loss occasioned by the latter. If in this state of\r\nmatters an additional supply of food be given, this balance is deranged,\r\nand the nutriment being in excess of the loss, the animal gains weight,\r\nand it continues to do this for some time, until it reaches a point at\r\nwhich a new balance is established, and its weight again becomes\r\nconstant; and this is due to the fact that the animal becomes subject to\r\nan additional waste, consequent on the increased weight of matter\r\naccumulated in its tissues. If, after the animal has attained its new\r\nconstant weight, the food be a second time increased, a further gain is\r\nobtained, and so on, with every addition to the supply of nutriment,\r\nuntil at length a certain point is reached, beyond which its weight\r\ncannot be forced. In fact, each successive increase of weight is\r\nobtained at a greater expenditure of food. If, for example, a lean\r\nanimal is taken, and its food increased by a given quantity, it will\r\nrapidly attain a certain additional weight, but if another extra supply\r\nof food be given, the increase due to it will be much more slowly\r\nattained, and so on until at length an additional increase can only be\r\nsecured by the long-continued consumption of a very large quantity of\r\nfood. The great object of the feeder is to obtain the greatest possible\r\nincrease with the smallest expenditure of food, and to know the point\r\nbeyond which it is no longer economical to attempt to force the process\r\nof fattening. To do this it is necessary first to consider the\r\ncomposition of the animal itself, then that of its food, and lastly, the\r\nmode in which it may be most economically used.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed that the animal tissues are composed of\r\nalbuminous or nitrogenous compounds, fat, mineral matters, and water;\r\nbut the proportions of these substances have, until lately, been very\r\nimperfectly known. Water is well known to be by far the largest\r\nconstituent, and amounts in general to about two-thirds of the entire\r\nweight, and it has been generally supposed that the nitrogenous matters\r\nstood next in point of abundance, but a most important and elaborate\r\nseries of experiments by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert have shewn that they\r\nare greatly exceeded by the fatty matters. The following table contains\r\na summary of the composition of ten different animals in different\r\nstages of fattening. The first division gives the composition of the\r\ncarcass, that is, the portion of the animal usually consumed as human\r\nfood; the second that of the offal, consisting of the parts not usually\r\nemployed as food; and the third that of the entire animals, including\r\nthe contents of the stomach and intestines:--\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Column titles are printed vertical, which is not\r\npossible to do here.

In one case only, that of the fat calf, are they\r\nequal. But in the lean sheep there is more than one and a half times as\r\nmuch fat as nitrogenous matters, in the half fat sheep twice, in the fat\r\nsheep four times, and in the very fat sheep about six times as much. As\r\na general result of the analyses it may be stated, that in the carcass\r\nof an ox in good condition, the quantity of fat will be from two to\r\nnearly three times as great as that of the so called albuminous\r\ncompounds; in a sheep three or four times, and in the pig four or five\r\ntimes as great. In the offal, including the hide, intestines, and other\r\nparts not usually consumed as food, the proportion is very\r\ndifferent,--the quantity of fat being much smaller, and that of\r\nnitrogenous compounds considerably larger.\r\n\r\nTaking a general average of the whole, the following may be assumed as\r\nrepresenting approximately the general composition of a lean and a fat\r\nanimal:--\r\n\r\n                                Lean.    Fat.\r\n\r\n     Mineral matters              5       3\r\n     Nitrogenous compounds       15      12.5\r\n     Fat                         24      33\r\n     Water                       56      48.5\r\n                                ---     -----\r\n                                100     100.0\r\n\r\nThe data given in the preceding table, coupled with a knowledge of the\r\nrelative weights of the lean and fat animals, enable us to ascertain the\r\ncomposition of the _increase_ during the fattening process. It is\r\nobvious, from the material diminution of the per centage of water, that\r\nthe matters deposited in the tissues must contain a much larger\r\nproportion of dry matters than the whole body; and the reduced per\r\ncentage of nitrogenous matters shews that the fat must also greatly\r\npreponderate. This is still more distinctly illustrated by the following\r\ntable, giving the per centage composition of the increase in fattening\r\noxen, sheep, and pigs:--\r\n\r\n     ------------------------------------------------\r\n           | Mineral  | Nitrogenous | Fat. | Water. |\r\n           | Matters. |  Compounds. |      |        |\r\n     ------------------------------------------------\r\n     Oxen  |  1.47    |    7.69     | 66.2 |  24.6  |\r\n     Sheep |  2.34    |    7.13     | 70.4 |  20.1  |\r\n     Pigs  |  0.06    |    6.44     | 71.5 |  22.0  |\r\n     ------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHence it may be stated in round numbers, that for every pound of\r\nnitrogenous matters added to the weight of a fattening animal, it will\r\ngain ten pounds of fat, and three of water. These are the proportions\r\nover the whole period of fattening, but it is probable that during the\r\nlast few weeks of the process the ratio of fat to nitrogenous matters is\r\nstill higher.\r\n\r\nIn considering the composition of the food of animals, it will be\r\nreadily admitted that the milk, the nutriment supplied by nature for the\r\nmaintenance of the young animal, must afford special instruction as to\r\nits requirements during the early stages of existence, and indicate, at\r\nleast, some of the points to be attended to under the altered conditions\r\nof mature life. The following table gives the average composition of the\r\nmilk of the most important farm animals:--\r\n\r\n                      Cow.    Ewe.    Goat.\r\n     Caseine          3.4     4.50     4.02\r\n     Butter           3.6     4.20     3.32\r\n     Sugar of milk    6.0     5.00     5.28\r\n     Ash              0.2     0.68     0.58\r\n     Water           86.8    85.62    86.80\r\n                   ------   ------   ------\r\n                   100.00   100.00   100.00\r\n\r\nIn examining these, and all other analyses of food, it is necessary to\r\ndraw a distinction between the flesh-forming and the respiratory\r\nelements; the former including the nitrogenous compounds which are used\r\nin the production of flesh, the latter, the non-nitrogenous substances\r\nwhich produce fat and support the process of respiration. The former,\r\nhowever much they may differ in name, are nearly or altogether identical\r\nin chemical composition, the latter embracing two great classes--the\r\nfats which exist in the body and the saccharine compounds, including the\r\ndifferent kinds of sugar and starch which are not found in the animal\r\ntissues. It was at one time supposed that these substances were entirely\r\nconsumed in the respiratory process, and eliminated by the lungs in the\r\nform of carbonic acid and water, but it has been clearly shewn that they\r\nmay be and often are converted into fat, and accumulated in the system.\r\nCareful experiments on bees have demonstrated that when fed on sugar\r\nthey continue to produce wax, which is a species of fat, and animals\r\nretain their health and become fat, even when their food contains\r\nscarcely any oil. There is, however, an important difference between\r\nthese two classes of substances as regards their fat-producing effect. A\r\npound of fat contained in the food is capable of producing the same\r\nquantity within the animal; but the case is different with starch and\r\nsugar, the most trustworthy experiments shewing that two and a half\r\npounds of these substances are necessary for that purpose. Hence we talk\r\nof the fat equivalent of sugar, by which is meant the amount of fat it\r\nis capable of producing, and which is obtained by dividing its quantity\r\nby 2.5. Applying this principle to the analyses of the milk, it appears\r\nthat the relative proportions of the two great classes of nutritive\r\nsubstances stand thus:--\r\n\r\n           Flesh   Respiratory, expressed in\r\n          forming    their fat equivalent\r\n\r\n     Cow    3.4             6.0\r\n     Ewe    4.5             6.2\r\n     Goat   4.0             5.4\r\n\r\nTaking the general average, it may be stated, that for every pound of\r\nflesh-forming elements contained in the food of the sucking animal, it\r\nconsumes respiratory compounds capable of producing one and a half\r\npounds of fat, and this does not differ materially from the ratio\r\nsubsisting between these substances in the lean animal. When the young\r\nanimal is weaned, it obtains a food in which the ratio of nitrogenous to\r\nrespiratory elements is maintained nearly unchanged; but the latter, in\r\nplace of containing a large amount of fatty matters, is in many cases\r\nnearly devoid of these substances, and consists almost exclusively of\r\nstarch and sugar, mixed most commonly with a considerable quantity of\r\nwoody fibre.\r\n\r\nA very large number of analyses of different kinds of cattle food have\r\nbeen made by chemists, but our information regarding them is still in\r\nsome respects imperfect. The quantity of nitrogenous compounds and of\r\noil has been accurately ascertained in almost all, but the amount of\r\nstarch, sugar, and woody fibre is still imperfectly determined in many\r\nsubstances. This is due partly to the fact that the nitrogenous and\r\nfatty matters were formerly believed to be of the highest importance,\r\nand might be used as the measure of the nutritive value of food to the\r\nexclusion of its other constituents, and partly also to the imperfect\r\nnature of the processes in use for obtaining the amounts of woody fibre,\r\nstarch, and sugar. These difficulties have now, to a certain extent,\r\nbeen overcome, and the quantity of fibre and of respiratory elements has\r\nbeen ascertained, and is introduced, so far as is known, in the\r\nsubjoined table:--\r\n\r\nTABLE giving the Composition of the Principal Varieties of Cattle Food.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Where a blank occurs in the oil column, the quantity of that\r\nsubstance is so small as to be unimportant.

the\r\nratio of the flesh to the fat-forming constituents differ very widely\r\nfrom that existing in the milk, and this becomes still more apparent\r\nwhen the latter are represented in their fat

varieties of food, which common\r\nexperience has shewn to promote the fattening of stock to the greatest\r\nextent, contain in many instances the smallest quantity of respiratory\r\nor fat-forming elements relatively to their nitrogenous compounds. This\r\nis especially the case with the different kinds of oil cake, the\r\nleguminous seeds, clover, hay, and turnips. On the other hand, in the\r\ngrains the ratio is nearly that of one to three, or similar to that\r\nfound in fat cattle; while in the straw, the excess of the respiratory\r\nelements is extremely great.\r\n\r\nThese facts appear at first sight to be completely at variance with the\r\ncomposition of the increase of fattening animals, as ascertained by\r\nMessrs. Lawes and Gilbert already referred to, and which have shewn that\r\nfor every pound of nitrogenous compounds, nearly ten pounds of fat are\r\nstored within the animal; and it might be supposed that those kinds of\r\nfood which contain the largest relative amount of respiratory elements\r\nought to fatten most rapidly, and should be selected by the farmer in\r\npreference to oil-cakes and similar substances. But there are other\r\nmatters to be considered, dependent on the complex nature of the changes\r\nattending the absorption and assimilation of the food. It must be\r\nparticularly borne in mind that only a small proportion of the food\r\nconsumed is stored up within the body, and goes to increase the weight\r\nof the animal. Even in the case of the milk, in which economy in the\r\nsupply of nutritive matters has been most clearly attended to by nature,\r\na considerable proportion escapes assimilation, and in the adult animal\r\na large amount of the food passes off with the excretions. The justice\r\nof this position is apparent when it is remembered that an ox will go on\r\nday after day consuming from a hundred weight to a hundred weight and a\r\nhalf of turnips, three or four pounds of bean-meal or oil-cake, and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of straw, although its daily increase in live\r\nweight may not exceed a couple of pounds. And in this direction a very\r\nfertile field of inquiry lies open to the agricultural experimenter; for\r\nit would be most important to determine whether there are not some\r\nsubstances from which the nutritive matters may not be more easily\r\nassimilated than from others, and what proportion of each is absorbable\r\nunder ordinary circumstances. On this point no information has yet been\r\nobtained applicable to individual feeding substances, but the\r\nexperiments of Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert have shewn the quantity of the\r\ntotal food, and of each of its constituents, stored up in the fattening\r\nanimal, and a summary of their results is contained in the following\r\nTable:--\r\n\r\nTABLE shewing the Amount of each Class of Constituents, stored in the\r\nincrease, for 100 consumed in the Food.\r\n\r\n     +------+---------+-------------+------+------------+\r\n     |      | Mineral | Nitrogenous |      | Total Dry  |\r\n     |      | Matters | Compounds.  | Fat. | Substance. |\r\n     +------+---------+-------------+------+------------+\r\n     |Sheep | 3.27    | 4.41        |  9.4 |   8.06     |\r\n     |Pigs  | 0.58    | 7.34        | 21.2 |  17.3      |\r\n     +------+---------+-------------+------+------------+\r\n\r\nHence it appears that the pig makes a better use of its food than the\r\nsheep, retaining twice as much of its solid constituents within the\r\nbody, from which may be deduced the important practical conclusion, that\r\nthe former must be fattened at a much smaller cost than the latter.\r\nLooking at the individual constituents, it appears that, in the sheep,\r\nless than one-twentieth of the nitrogenous compounds, and one-tenth of\r\nthe non-nitrogenous substances contained in the food, remain in the\r\nbody; and a knowledge of these facts tends to modify the conclusions\r\nwhich might be drawn from the composition of the increase in the\r\nfattening animal. Its influence may be best illustrated by a particular\r\nexample. If, for instance, the increase in a sheep contained its\r\nnitrogenous and respiratory elements in the ratio of 1 to 10, it would\r\nbe totally incorrect to supply these substances in the food in the same\r\nproportions. On the contrary, it would be necessary at the very least to\r\ndouble the proportion of the former, because one-tenth of the\r\nfat-forming elements are absorbed, and only one-twentieth of the\r\nnitrogenous.\r\n\r\nOn further consideration, also, it seems unquestionable that the\r\nquantity of the nutritive elements stored up must depend to a large\r\nextent on the nature of the food and the particular state in which they\r\nexist in it. It is probable, or at least possible, that some kinds of\r\nfood may contain their nitrogenous constituents in an easily assimilable\r\nstate, and their respiratory elements in a nearly indigestible\r\ncondition, or _vice versa_, and under these circumstances their\r\nnutritive value would be below that indicated by analysis; but these\r\npoints can only be determined by elaborate and long continued feeding\r\nexperiments. It is well known, however, that the mechanical state of the\r\nfood has a most important influence on its nutritive value. Thus, for\r\nexample, the presence of a large quantity of woody fibre protects the\r\nnutritive substances from assimilation, and seeds with hard husks pass\r\nunchanged through the animal, although, so far as their composition\r\nalone is concerned, they may be highly nutritive; and the loss of a\r\ncertain quantity of many varieties of food in this way is familiar to\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\nThe proper adjustment of the relative quantities of the great groups of\r\nnutritive elements in the food is a matter the importance of which\r\ncannot be over-rated, for it is in fact the foundation of successful and\r\neconomical feeding; and this will be readily understood if we consider\r\nwhat would be the result of giving to an animal a supply of food\r\ncontaining a large quantity of nitrogenous and a deficiency of\r\nfat-forming compounds. In such circumstances, the animal must either\r\nlanguish for want of the latter, or it is forced to supply the defect by\r\nan increased consumption of food, in doing which it must take into the\r\nsystem a larger quantity of nitrogenous compounds than would otherwise\r\nhave been requisite, and in this way the other elements, which are\r\npresent in abundance, are wasted, and the theoretical and practical\r\nvalue of a food so constituted may be very different, and it is only\r\nwhen the proportions of the different groups are properly attended to\r\nthat the most economical result can be obtained. It can scarcely be said\r\nthat the experiments yet made by feeders enable us to fix the most\r\nsuitable proportion in which those substances can be employed, although\r\nexperience has led them to the use of mixtures which are in most cases\r\ntheoretically correct; thus they combine oil-cakes or turnips with\r\nstraw, which is poor nitrogenous, and rich in fat-forming elements; and\r\nin general it will be found that where different kinds of food are\r\nmixed, the deficiencies of the one are counterbalanced by the other, and\r\nthough this has hitherto been done empirically, it cannot be doubted\r\nthat as our knowledge advances it will more and more be determined by\r\nreference to the composition of the food.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presence of a sufficient quantity of nutritive compounds in\r\nthe food is necessarily the fundamental matter for consideration, its\r\nbulk is scarcely less important. The function of digestion requires that\r\nthe food shall properly fill the stomach, and however large the supply\r\nof nutritive matters may be, their effect is imperfectly brought out if\r\nthe food is too small in bulk, and it actually may become more valuable\r\nif diluted with woody fibre, or some other inert substance. At first\r\nsight this may appear at variance with the observations already made as\r\nto the effects of woody fibre in protecting the nutritive matters from\r\nabsorption; but practically there are two opposite evils to be contended\r\nagainst, a food having too small a bulk, or one containing so large a\r\nproportion of inert substances as to become disadvantageously\r\nvoluminous. The most favourable condition lies between the two extremes,\r\nand the natural food of all herbivorous animals is diluted with a\r\ncertain amount of woody fibre. When these are replaced by substances\r\ncontaining a large quantity of nutritive matters in a small bulk, the\r\nresult is that the natural instinct of the animal causes it to continue\r\nfeeding until the stomach is properly distended, and it consequently\r\nconsumes a much larger quantity of food than it is capable of digesting,\r\nand a more or less considerable quantity passes unchanged through the\r\nintestines, and is lost. On the other hand, if the food be too bulky,\r\nthe sense of repletion causes the animal to cease eating long before it\r\nhas obtained a sufficient supply of nutritive matter. It is most\r\nnecessary, therefore, to study the mixture of different kinds of food,\r\nso as to obtain a proper relation between the bulk and the nutritive\r\nmatters contained in the mixture; and on examining the nature of the\r\nmixed foods most in vogue among feeders, it will be found that a very\r\nbulky food is usually conjoined with another of opposite qualities.\r\nHence it is that turnips, the most voluminous of all foods, are used\r\nalong with oil-cake and bean-meal, and if from any circumstances it\r\nbecomes necessary to replace a large amount of the former by either of\r\nthe latter substances, the deficient bulk must be replaced by hay or\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that there are three great purposes to\r\nwhich the food consumed is appropriated; the increase of weight of the\r\nanimal--the object the feeder has in view and desires to promote--the\r\nsupplying the waste of the tissues, and the process of respiration, both\r\nof which are sources of loss of food, and which it must necessarily be\r\nhis aim to diminish as much as possible. The circumstances which must be\r\nattended to in order to do this are sufficiently well understood. It has\r\nbeen clearly established that the natural heat of the animal is\r\nsustained by the consumption of a certain quantity of its food in the\r\nrespiratory process, during which it undergoes exactly the same changes\r\nas those which occur during combustion. It has further been observed,\r\nthat the temperature of the body remains unchanged, whatever be that of\r\nthe surrounding air; and it is obvious that if it is to continue the\r\nsame in winter as in summer, a larger quantity of fuel (_i. e._ food)\r\nmust be consumed for this purpose, just as a room requires more fire to\r\nkeep it warm in winter than in summer, and hence it naturally follows,\r\nthat if the animal be kept in a warm locality the food is economized. It\r\nmay also be inferred that, if it were possible, consistently with the\r\nhealth of the animal, to keep it in a room artificially heated to the\r\ntemperature of its own body, this source of waste of food would be\r\nentirely removed. It is not possible, however, to do this, because a\r\nlimit is set to it by physiological laws, which cannot be infringed with\r\nimpunity; but the housing of cattle, so as to diminish this waste as far\r\nas possible, is a point in regard to the propriety of which theory and\r\npractice are at one.\r\n\r\nThe old feeders kept their cattle in large open courts, where they were\r\nexposed to every vicissitude of the weather, but as intelligence\r\nadvanced, we find them substituting, first hammels, and then stalls, in\r\nwhich the animals are kept during the whole time of fattening at an\r\nequable temperature. The effect of this is necessarily to introduce a\r\nconsiderable economy of the food required to sustain the animal heat;\r\nbut it also produces a saving in another way, for it diminishes the\r\nwaste of the tissues.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by accurate experiments made chiefly on man,\r\nthat muscular exertion is one of the most important causes of the waste\r\nof the tissues, and of increased respiratory activity. We cannot move a\r\nlimb without producing a corresponding consumption of matters already\r\nlaid up within the body; and it has also been found, that the difference\r\nin the quantity of carbonic acid expired during rest and active\r\nexertion, is very large. The inference to be drawn from this is, that\r\nwhen it is sought to fatten an animal rapidly, every effort must be made\r\nto restrain muscular motion so far as compatible with health. Hence, the\r\npeculiar advantage of stall-feeding, in which the animal is confined to\r\none spot, and the more thoroughly it can be kept still, the greater will\r\nbe the economy of food. This is gained by darkening the house, and\r\nexcluding all persons, except when their presence is indispensable.\r\n\r\nAn extension of the same principle has led to the use of food\r\nartificially heated, but it is doubtful whether the advantages derived\r\nfrom it are commensurate to the increased expense of the process; at\r\nleast opinions differ among the best informed practical men on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMany other matters, besides these mentioned, exercise an important\r\ninfluence on the feeding of stock, such as the general health of the\r\nanimal, the breed, etc. These are subjects, however, which bear more\r\ndirectly on practical agriculture, and need not be discussed here.\r\n\r\nThe judicious feeder will not only give due weight to the principles\r\nalready discussed in all he does, but he must take into consideration\r\nthe extent to which they are liable to be modified in particular cases.\r\nHe must also attend to the cost of different kinds of food, and the\r\nvalue of the manure produced by them, subjects of much importance in a\r\npractical point of view, and which must influence him greatly in choice\r\nof the particular substances he supplies
