E. DONALD CARR.\r\n\r\n_EIGHTH EDITION_.\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\nJAMES NISBET & CO., LIMITED,\r\n21 BERNERS STREET, W.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH:\r\nPRINTED BY LORIMER AND CHALMERS,\r\n31 ST. ANDREW SQUARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn publishing the following account of \"A Night in the Snow,\" which has\r\nalready been given as a Lecture before the Society for the Promotion of\r\nReligious and Useful Knowledge at Bridgnorth, I feel that some apology is\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nMy preservation through the night of the 29th of January last was\r\ndoubtless most wonderful, and my experience perhaps almost without\r\nprecedent, in this country at least; for, though many people have at\r\ndifferent times been lost in the snow, scarcely any one has passed\r\nthrough the ordeal of such a day and night as that undergone by myself,\r\nand lived to tell the tale.  Still I should never have thought that the\r\nmatter was of sufficient importance to justify me in printing an account\r\nof it, had I not discovered that my adventure has created a public\r\ninterest, for which I was totally unprepared.  I have been so repeatedly\r\nasked to write a detailed account of all the circumstances connected with\r\nmy wanderings on the Long Mynd in the snow during that night and the\r\nfollowing day, and to have it published, that I have at last (though, I\r\nmust confess, somewhat reluctantly) consented to do so, and with that\r\nview have drawn up the following account.\r\n\r\nIn writing my story, I have been obliged to go into many very small\r\nmatters of detail, which may perhaps appear trivial; but it seemed to me\r\nthat the interest of a story of this kind, if there be any interest\r\nattached to it, generally turns upon minor circumstances.  I have also\r\nbeen obliged to speak of myself in a very personal manner, but I did not\r\nsee how I could put the reader in possession of the geographical points\r\nof the case, without describing the duties I had to perform, and the\r\ncountry I had to traverse.\r\n\r\nE. DONALD CARR.\r\n\r\nWOLSTASTON RECTORY,\r\n_April_ 17, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NIGHT IN THE SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains of South-West Shropshire are less known to the lovers of\r\nfine scenery than their great beauty deserves, though they are familiar\r\nto most geologists as the typical region of the lowest fossil-bearing\r\ndeposits.  Of this group of hills the highest is the Long Mynd, a\r\nmountain district of very remarkable character, and many miles in extent.\r\nIt is about ten miles long, and from three to four miles in breadth.  Its\r\nsummit is a wide expanse of table land, the highest part of which is\r\nnearly seventeen hundred feet above the level of the sea.  The whole of\r\nthis unenclosed moorland is covered with gorse and heather, making it\r\nextremely gay in the summer time; it is also tolerably abundant in grouse\r\nand black game, and so fruitful in bilberries, that from 400 to 500\r\npounds worth are said to have been gathered on it in the course of a\r\nsingle season.  On first hearing it, this sounds an improbable statement;\r\nbut any one who has been upon the mountain in a good \"whinberry season\"\r\nas it is called, will readily understand that this is no exaggeration.  To\r\nthe poor people for miles around, the \"whinberry picking\" is the great\r\nevent of the year.  The whole family betake themselves to the hill with\r\nthe early morning, carrying with them their provisions for the day; and\r\nnot unfrequently a kettle to prepare tea forms part of their load.  I\r\nknow no more picturesque sight than that presented by the summit of the\r\nLong Mynd towards four o'clock on an August afternoon, when numerous\r\nfires are lit among the heather, and as many kettles steaming away on the\r\ntop of them, while noisy, chattering groups of women and children are\r\nclustered round, glad to rest after a hard day's work.  A family will\r\npick many quarts of bilberries in the day, and as these are sold at\r\nprices varying from 3d. to 5d. a quart, it will be readily understood\r\nthat it is by no means impossible that the large sum of 400 or 500 pounds\r\nshould thus be realised in a single season.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this Long Mynd mountain on the northern side, looking\r\ntowards Shrewsbury, presents no feature of striking interest, and the\r\nascent is a gradual one, leading chiefly through cultivated ground; but\r\nthe aspect of the south-eastern or Stretton side is wild in the extreme,\r\nthe whole face of the mountain being broken up into deep ravines, with\r\nprecipitous sides, where purple rocks project boldly through the turf,\r\nand in many places even the active sheep and mountain ponies can scarcely\r\nfind a footing.  Down each of these ravines runs a small stream of\r\nexquisitely pure water, one of which, near the entrance of the valley,\r\nbecomes considerable enough to turn a mill for carding wool.  This stream\r\nfalls over rocks at the head of the ravine, in a small cascade of a\r\nconsiderable height called the Light Spout.\r\n\r\nMany people have lost their lives among these hills at different times,\r\nand places here and there bear such suggestive names, as \"Dead Man's\r\nBeach,\" \"Dead Man's Hollow,\" &c.  The last fair, too, which is held at\r\nChurch Stretton before Christmas is locally known as \"Dead Man's Fair,\"\r\nseveral men have perished whilst attempting to return home after it\r\nacross the hill in the dark November night.  No one, however, till this\r\nwinter has been lost for many years.  Two drovers were the last persons\r\nwho perished here, and they lost their lives near a place called \"The\r\nThresholds,\" in a deep snow which fell in April thirty-seven years ago.\r\n\r\nThe western slope of the Long Mynd is less strikingly picturesque and\r\nmore desolate, but the view from the top in this direction is the finest\r\nof any.  Almost unseen in a narrow valley at the foot of the mountain,\r\nstand the village and church of Ratlinghope, the centre of a parish\r\nnumbering about three hundred souls only, but which stretches over miles\r\nof mountain country, embracing a portion of the wild mining district of\r\nthe Stiper Stones.  Beyond these hills the eye passes to the Welsh\r\nmountains, and rests at last on the grand peaks of Cader Idris in one\r\ndirection, and Snowdon in the other, which may be seen in clear weather\r\nsharply defined against a sunset sky.\r\n\r\nPoor Ratlinghope was in sore need of some one to look after it when the\r\nliving was offered to me in September 1856.  It had at that time been\r\nleft for many Sundays together without a service, the late incumbent\r\nresiding in Shrewsbury, twelve miles distant, and being frequently\r\nprevented by ill health from coming over.  There is no house in the\r\nparish where a clergyman could live, or even procure tolerable lodgings;\r\nand if there were, there is next to nothing, as one of the parishioners\r\nsaid to me the other day, \"to find coals to warm it with.\"  It is\r\nscarcely to be wondered at that under these circumstances, when the\r\nliving became vacant in the summer of 1856, there was no suitable person\r\nto be found who was willing to accept so desirable a piece of preferment.\r\nThe parish of Wolstaston, of which I have the charge, and in which I\r\nreside, is situated on high ground on the eastern slope of the Long Mynd,\r\n_i.e._ exactly on the opposite side of the mountain to Ratlinghope.  Above\r\nWolstaston the ground rises steadily for about a mile and a half till you\r\ncome to the unenclosed moorland, which stretches away for many miles of\r\nopen country, covered with heather and gorse.  It was under the\r\ncircumstances that I have already mentioned that the living of\r\nRatlinghope was offered to me.  I was aware that it would be impossible\r\nto attend to the parish as one would wish to do, with four miles of this\r\nwild hill country to cross between the two villages.  Still, as no one\r\nelse could be found to take it, and I thought that the Ratlinghope people\r\nmight think that \"half-a-loaf was better than no bread,\" I consented to\r\naccept the living, and do the best I could for it; so I altered my second\r\nservice at Wolstaston from three o'clock in the afternoon to six, which\r\nenabled me to give an afternoon service at Ratlinghope every Sunday.\r\n\r\nI soon found, however, that the task I had undertaken was no very light\r\none, as the only access from Wolstaston to Ratlinghope was by mountain\r\ntracks, over the highest part of the Long Mynd, unless indeed one drove\r\nround the base of the hill, a distance of at least twelve miles.  The\r\nride was pleasant enough in fine weather, but less enjoyable when fogs\r\nhung heavy over the hill, when the tracks were slippery with ice, or when\r\nfalling snow concealed every landmark.  It not unfrequently happened in\r\nwinter, when the snow was very deep, or much drifted, that it was\r\nimpossible to ride across the hill, and the expedition then had to be\r\nperformed on foot; still I always managed to cross somehow, in spite of\r\nwind or weather, so that during the last eight years and a half the\r\nlittle mountain church has never been without one Sunday service.  I find\r\nthat during that time I have crossed the Long Mynd (in round numbers)\r\nnearly two thousand five hundred times; consequently my knowledge of the\r\ncountry became so intimate, that I felt equally at home upon the hill in\r\nall weathers, and at all hours of the day and night.  On one occasion, I\r\nhad to cross it late on a November night and in a dense fog, when\r\nreturning home from Ratlinghope, and met with no accident; and I think\r\nthat this and similar experiences made me somewhat over confident.  I\r\nmention this to show how little the most perfect acquaintance with\r\ncountry will avail any one when overtaken by such a blinding snow storm\r\nas that of the 29th of January last.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding week the snow fell heavily, and accumulated on the\r\nhills to a greater depth than had been known for fifty-one years.  Public\r\nopinion was unanimous that there had been nothing like it since 1814.  A\r\nstrong wind, moreover, had so drifted it that the roads were impassable,\r\nand the communication between neighbouring villages, and even between\r\nhouses in the same village, almost ceased.  Letters wont to be received\r\nin the morning arrived late in the day, or not at all; and unhappy folk\r\nwho were unprovided with a good store of food and coals had either to\r\nborrow of their neighbours or starve.  The morning service at Wolstaston\r\non Sunday the 29th was of necessity but thinly attended, and it seemed\r\nprobable that I should not even be expected at Ratlinghope.  As, however,\r\nthe service there had never been omitted owing to bad weather, I was\r\nanxious to get to my little church if possible; in fact, I considered it\r\nmy duty to make the attempt, though I felt very doubtful whether I should\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, very soon after morning service at Wolstaston was over, I\r\nstarted on the expedition.  I was in such a hurry to be off that I could\r\nnot stay to take my usual luncheon, but swallowed a few mouthfuls of\r\nsoup, and put a small flask containing about three ounces of brandy in my\r\npocket.  My taking anything of the kind with me was a most unprecedented\r\ncircumstance.  I only remember one other occasion in which I did so, and\r\nthat was also in a very deep snow; but now foreseeing a walk of no common\r\ndifficulty, I thought the precaution a wise one, and saw reason\r\nafterwards to be thankful that I had adopted it.\r\n\r\nI started on horseback, though I knew that I could only ride a short\r\ndistance, but thought it advisable to save myself all unnecessary\r\nfatigue.  I was of course accompanied by a servant to bring back the\r\nhorses when they were of no further use.  By leaving the lane and making\r\nour way across the fields over hedge and ditch, we contrived to ride\r\nabout half a mile.  The horses then became useless, as the drifts were so\r\ndeep against the hedges and gates, that the poor animals became imbedded\r\nin them, and were unable to find any firm footing to leap from.  The\r\nservant therefore had to return with them long before I reached the\r\nunenclosed mountain land, and I proceeded on my way alone.\r\n\r\nThe journey proved more difficult even than I had expected.  The snow was\r\nfor the most part up to the knees and very soft, and the drifts were so\r\ndeep that they could only be crossed by crawling on hands and knees, as\r\nany one will readily understand who has attempted to cross deep snow when\r\nin a soft state.  When I reached the open moorland the day was bright and\r\nfine, and the snow stretched around me for miles in a dazzling expanse\r\nvery painful to the eyes, and unbroken by track, landmark, or footprint\r\nof any living creature.  The form of the country, however, was a\r\nsufficient guide to my destination, and after a severe struggle over and\r\nthrough the drifts, I reached my little church at a quarter-past three\r\no'clock, just two hours and a quarter from the time I had left\r\nWolstaston.  A few people were assembled together, though no one had\r\nreally expected me, and after a short service I started on my homeward\r\njourney, having refused the invitations of my kind people to stay the\r\nnight amongst them, as I was anxious to get back to Wolstaston in time\r\nfor my six o'clock evening service, and I did not anticipate that I\r\nshould encounter any greater difficulties in my return home than I had\r\ndone in coming to Ratlinghope.\r\n\r\nDuring the three quarters of an hour, however, that we had been in\r\nchurch, the aspect of the weather had completely changed.  A furious gale\r\nhad come on from E.S.E., which, as soon as I got on the open moorland, I\r\nfound was driving clouds of snow and icy sleet before it.  It was with\r\nconsiderable difficulty that I made my way up the western ascent of the\r\nhill, as I had to walk in the teeth of this gale.  The force of the wind\r\nwas most extraordinary.  I have been in many furious gales, but never in\r\nanything to compare with that, as it took me off my legs, and blew me\r\nflat down upon the ground over and over again.  The sleet too was most\r\npainful, stinging one's face, and causing such injury to the eyes, that\r\nit was impossible to lift up one's head.  I contrived, however, to fight\r\nmy way through it, and at length reached the crest of the hill.  Though I\r\ncould not see many yards in any direction, I knew at this time exactly\r\nwhere I was, as I passed the carcase of a mountain pony which I had\r\npreviously noticed.  The poor thing had no doubt been famished to death,\r\nand was fast wasting to a skeleton.  Numbers of these hardy little\r\nanimals have perished during the severe weather from hunger, having been\r\npreviously reduced to the lowest condition through lack of pasturage\r\nduring the dry season of 1864.  One man, who owned fourteen of them, has\r\nlost every one.\r\n\r\nLeaving this solitary waymark, the half buried skeleton, by which I had\r\nrested for a few minutes and taken a little of my brandy, I started\r\nagain, having first made a careful observation of the direction in which\r\nI should go.  After a further struggle across the level summit of the\r\nhill, I reached my second landmark, a pool in a little hollow between the\r\nhills, which is well known to the inhabitants of the district, and\r\ninteresting to naturalists, as the resort of curlews and other rare\r\nbirds; here again I took a short rest, and then started upon what I\r\nfondly dreamed would be the last difficult stage of my journey.\r\n\r\nMy way from the pool lay first up a steep ascent for rather less than\r\nhalf a mile to the top of the hill, and then across a level flat for some\r\nthree or four hundred yards, when a fir plantation would be reached at\r\nthe edge of the enclosed ground.  Once within the friendly shelter of\r\nthose firs, I knew that the remainder of my walk, though still tedious\r\nand fatiguing, would be comparatively easy.  It pleased God, however,\r\nthat I should never reach them that night.  Doubtless I had been too\r\nconfident in my own powers, and at the very time when I thought the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of my task were well nigh accomplished, I was\r\ntaught a lesson which I shall remember to the latest hour of my life.  I\r\nascended the hill to the flat already spoken of, though it was a very\r\nslow process, for owing to the depth of the drifts, which were now\r\nincreasing rapidly, and the force of the wind, I was compelled to crawl a\r\ngreat part of the way.  The storm now came on, if possible, with\r\nincreased fury.  It was quite impossible to look up or see for a yard\r\naround, and the snow came down so thick and fast that my servant, who had\r\ncome some distance up the lane from Wolstaston in hopes of seeing\r\nsomething of me, describing it to me afterwards, said, \"Sir, it was just\r\nas if they were throwing it on to us out of buckets.\"  I fought on\r\nthrough it, however, expecting soon to come to the fir wood.  On and on I\r\nwent, but not a glimpse of its friendly shelter could I see, the real\r\nfact being that I had borne away a great deal too much to the right,\r\nalmost at right angles to my proper course.  Having been blown down over\r\nand over again, I had probably, in rising to my feet, altered my\r\ndirection unconsciously.  The wind too, by which I had been trying to\r\nsteer, proved a treacherous compass; for, as I have been told, about this\r\ntime it went more round into the south.  It was, moreover, becoming very\r\ndark.  After a while I became aware that the ground under my feet was of\r\na wrong shape, sloping downwards when it should have been level, and I\r\nthen knew that I had missed my way.  This, however, gave me no great\r\nuneasiness, as I imagined that I had only gone a little too much to the\r\nsouth of the wood, and that I should soon reach an inhabited district at\r\nthe bottom of it, known as Bullock's Moor, from which a somewhat\r\ncircuitous route would bring me safely home.  Under this impression I\r\nwalked cheerfully on, but only for a few steps further.  Suddenly my feet\r\nflew from under me, and I found myself shooting at a fearful pace down\r\nthe side of one of the steep ravines which I had imagined lay far away to\r\nmy right.  I thought to check myself by putting my stick behind me, and\r\nbearing heavily upon it in the manner usual under such circumstances in\r\nAlpine travelling.  Before, however, I could do so I came in contact with\r\nsomething which jerked it out of my hand and turned me round, so that I\r\ncontinued my tremendous glissade head downwards, lying on my back.\r\n\r\nThe pace I was going in this headlong descent must have been very great,\r\nyet it seemed to me to occupy a marvellous space of time, long enough for\r\nthe events of my whole previous life to pass in review before me, as I\r\nhad often before heard that they did in moments of extreme peril.  I\r\nnever lost my consciousness, but had time to think much of those I should\r\nleave behind me, expecting every moment as I did to be dashed over the\r\nrocks at the bottom of the ravine; knew in fact that such must be my\r\nfate, unless I could stop myself by some means.  Owing to the softness of\r\nthe snow, I contrived to accomplish this by kicking my foot as deep into\r\nthe snow as I could, and at the same time bending my knee with a smart\r\nmuscular effort, so as to make a hook of my leg; this brought me to a\r\nstand still, but my position was anything but agreeable even then,\r\nhanging head downwards on a very steep part, and never knowing any moment\r\nbut what I might start again.  With much difficulty, however, I at length\r\nsucceeded in getting myself the right way up, and then descended with\r\ngreat care to the bottom of the ravine, intending if possible to walk\r\nalong the course of the stream in its hollow till it should lead me to\r\nthe enclosed country.  The ravine, however, was so choked up with snow,\r\nthat to walk along the valley was utterly impossible.  The drifts were\r\nmany feet over my head, in several places they must have been at least\r\ntwenty feet in depth; and having once got into them, I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty, by scratching and struggling, to extricate myself from them\r\nagain.  It was now dark.  I did not know into which of the ravines I had\r\nfallen, for at this part there is a complete network of them intersecting\r\neach other in every direction.  The only way by which I had thought to\r\nescape was hopelessly blocked up, and I had to face the awful fact that I\r\nwas lost among the hills, should have to spend the night there, and that,\r\nhumanly speaking, it was almost impossible that I could survive it.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of self-preservation, however, is strong, even when a\r\nfearful death seems close at hand, and there were others for whose sake,\r\neven more than my own, I desired that night that my life might be spared,\r\nif such were God's will.  I knew that, under Providence, all depended on\r\nmy own powers of endurance, and that the struggle for life must be a very\r\nsevere one.  The depth of the snow made walking a very exhausting effort.\r\nIt was always up to my knees, more often up to my waist; but my only\r\nchance, as I was well aware, was to keep moving; and having extricated\r\nmyself at last from the drifts in the ravine, I began to climb the\r\nopposite side of the hill, though I had not the least idea in which\r\ndirection I ought to go.  As I made my way upwards, I saw just in front\r\nof me what looked like a small shadow flitting about, for owing to the\r\nwhite ground it was never completely dark.  I was much surprised at this,\r\nespecially as when I came close to it, it disappeared into the snow, with\r\nthe exception of one round dark spot, which remained motionless.  I put\r\nmy hand down upon this dark object to ascertain what it could possibly\r\nbe, and found that I had got hold of a hare's head!  I saw many of these\r\nlittle animals in the course of the night.  They made holes in the snow\r\nfor shelter, and sat in them well protected by their warm coats, happier\r\nfar than their human fellow-sufferer, who knew that for him there must be\r\nno rest that night if he would see the light of another day.\r\n\r\nHaving climbed the hill, I walked along its crest for some distance, till\r\nsuddenly I again lost my footing, and shot down the hill, as far as I can\r\njudge, on the opposite side into another ravine.  This was, if possible,\r\na more fearful glissade than my previous one; it was a very precipitous\r\nplace, and I was whirled round and round in my descent, sometimes head\r\nfirst, sometimes feet first, and again sideways, rolling over and over,\r\ntill at last, by clutching at the gorse bushes, and digging my feet into\r\nthe snow as before, I once more managed to check my wild career, and\r\nbring myself to a stand; but I had lost my hat and a pair of warm fur\r\ngloves, which I had on over a pair of old dogskins.  The loss of these\r\nfur gloves proved very serious to me, as my hands soon began to get so\r\nnumbed with the cold, that they were comparatively useless.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the ravine into which I had now fallen, I found myself\r\nagain involved in snow drifts, and had still more difficulty than before\r\nin getting out of them.  I had tumbled into a very soft one far over my\r\nhead, and had to fight, and scratch, and burrow for a long time before I\r\ncould extricate myself, and became more exhausted than at any other time\r\nduring the night.  I only ventured to take my brandy very sparingly,\r\nwishing to husband it as much as possible, and there was but a very tiny\r\ndrop left.  My hands, as I have said, were so numbed with cold as to be\r\nnearly useless.  I had the greatest difficulty in holding the flask, or\r\nin eating snow for refreshment, and could hardly get my hands to my mouth\r\nfor the masses of ice which had formed upon my whiskers, and which were\r\ngradually developed into a long crystal beard, hanging half way to my\r\nwaist.  Icicles likewise had formed about my eyes and eyebrows, which I\r\nfrequently had to break off, and my hair had frozen into a solid block of\r\nice.  After the loss of my hat, my hair must, I suppose, have become\r\nfilled with snow, while I was overhead in the drifts.  Probably this was\r\npartially melted by the warmth of my head, and subsequently converted\r\ninto ice by the intense frost.  Large balls of ice also formed upon my\r\ncuffs, and underneath my knees, which encumbered me very much in walking,\r\nand I had continually to break them off.  I tried to supply the place of\r\nmy hat by tying my handkerchief over my head, but found that by no\r\npossible effort could I make a knot, and that I could only keep it on my\r\nhead by holding the corners between my teeth.  It was equally impossible\r\nto refasten my overcoat, only a thin tweed (for I had dressed lightly, in\r\nexpectation of hard exercise), which had become unbuttoned in my last\r\nfall.  It may seem absurd to mention it, but the cravings of hunger grew\r\nso keen, stimulated as they were by the cold and the great exertion, that\r\nit actually occurred to me whether I could eat one of my old dogskin\r\ngloves.  I was, however, deterred from making the attempt, partly by the\r\nprospect of its toughness, and partly by the fear of greater injury to my\r\nhands from frost bite, if they were deprived of their last covering.  My\r\nexhaustion was so great that I fell down every two or three steps, and\r\nthe temptation to give in and lie down in the snow became almost\r\nirresistible, and had to be struggled against with every power of mind\r\nand body.  I endeavoured to keep constantly before me the certain fact,\r\nthat if sleep once overcame me I should never wake again in this life.\r\nThe night seemed interminably long.  Again and again I tried to calculate\r\nthe time, but always came to the same conclusion, that many hours must\r\nelapse before the return of daylight.  The wind had gone down, and the\r\nstillness became so oppressive, that I often spoke aloud for the sake of\r\nhearing my own voice, and to ascertain that the cold, which was intense,\r\nhad not deprived me of the power of speech.  The hares still sported and\r\nburrowed on the hill sides, but excepting these there were no signs of\r\nlife whatever.\r\n\r\nNever did shipwrecked mariner watch for the morning more anxiously than\r\ndid I through that weary, endless night, for I knew that a glimpse of the\r\ndistance in any one direction would enable me to steer my course\r\nhomewards.  Day dawned at last, but hope and patience were to be yet\r\nfurther tried, for a dense fog clung to the face of the hill, obscuring\r\neverything but the objects close at hand.  Furthermore, I discovered that\r\nI was rapidly becoming snow blind.  My eyes, which had been considerably\r\ninjured already by the sharp sleet of the evening before, were further\r\naffected by the glare of the snow, and I was fast losing all distinctness\r\nof vision.  I first learned the extent of this new calamity when\r\nendeavouring, with the earliest light, to look at my watch.  It was a\r\nwork of great difficulty to get it out of my pocket; and when this was\r\ndone, I found that I could not tell the face from the back.  The whole\r\nthing was hazy and indistinct, and I can only describe it as looking like\r\nan orange seen through a mist.  Such sight as remained rapidly became all\r\nconfusion as regarded the form, colour, and proportion of objects.  Again\r\nand again I thought I saw before me trees and enclosures, but these, when\r\nI came up to them, invariably turned out to be only portions of gorse\r\nbushes projecting through the snow.  My optical delusions as to _colour_\r\nwere perhaps the most remarkable; the protruding rocks invariably\r\nappeared of a strange orange yellow, with black lines along them,\r\nproducing a short of tortoise-shell effect.  I took these mysterious\r\nappearances at first for dead animals, ponies or sheep, and touched them\r\nto try to ascertain the fact.  My hands, however, were so utterly devoid\r\nof sensation, that they were of no more use than my eyes in identifying\r\nobjects.  I was therefore quite in the dark as to their nature, till\r\nexperience proved them to be rocks with tufts of heather on them.  Owing\r\nto my failing eyesight, my falls became very frequent, and several of\r\nthem were from heights so great that it would scarcely be believed were I\r\nto attempt to describe them.  I may, however, say, that they were such as\r\nperfectly to appal those who, a few days afterwards, visited the spots\r\nwhere they occurred, and saw the deep impressions in the snow where I had\r\nplunged into it from the rocks above.  One fall especially I well\r\nremember.  I had just crossed the ridge of a hill, and saw, as I\r\nimagined, close below me a pool covered with ice, which seemed free from\r\nsnow.  I thought I would walk across this, and, accordingly, made a\r\nslight jump from the rock on which I stood in order to reach it.  In a\r\nmoment, however, I discovered that, instead of on to a pool, I had jumped\r\ninto empty space.  I must have fallen on this occasion a considerable\r\ndistance, but I was caught in a deep snow-drift, so that, although\r\nconsiderably shaken and bewildered for the moment by what had happened, I\r\nwas not seriously hurt.\r\n\r\nI have been enabled by various circumstances, and by the help of those\r\nwho followed my tracks before the snow melted, to make out with tolerable\r\naccuracy the course of my wanderings.  Those who tracked me say that, \"If\r\nthere was one part of the hill more difficult and dangerous than another,\r\nthat is the line which Mr. Carr took.\"  When the morning light first\r\ndawned, I could see that I was walking along the side of a ravine of\r\ngreat depth, and more than usually perpendicular sides; it was so steep\r\nthat I could not climb to the top of the ridge and get out of it, and the\r\nsnow was in such a very loose, soft state, that I expected every moment\r\nit would give way beneath me, and I should be precipitated into the\r\ndepths below.  I had to walk with the greatest care to prevent this; and\r\nI believe that this was a very good thing for me, as it gave my mind\r\ncomplete occupation, and kept me from flagging.  I could only go straight\r\non, as I could not ascend, and was afraid to descend.  My method of\r\nprogression was more crawling than walking, as I had to drive my hands\r\ndeep into the snow, and clutch at tufts of grass or heather, or any thing\r\nI could find beneath it, to hold on by.  I must have gone forward in this\r\nway for an hour or two, when I found the ravine becoming less steep, and\r\nI heard the sound of running water very distinctly.  Accordingly I\r\nthought I would descend and try once more whether I could walk down the\r\nstream, as this by its sound seemed a larger one, and I thought it might\r\nhave cut a way through the drifts.  I reached the bottom of the valley\r\nsafely.  It appears to have been the valley immediately above the Light\r\nSpout waterfall, and, trying to walk by the stream, I tumbled over the\r\nfirst upper fall.  Hearing a noise of falling water, and seeing dimly\r\nrocks all round me, I found it would not do to go forward in this\r\ndirection, so, having unconsciously gone to the very edge of the lower\r\ncascade, where I must in all probability have been killed had I fallen\r\nover, I turned sharply up the hill again, going over the rocks above, and\r\ncoming down again by a very steep place.  Round and round this waterfall\r\nI seemed to have climbed in every possible direction.  A man who had\r\ntracked me, and with whom I visited the place a few weeks ago, said, \"You\r\nseem to have had a deal o' work to do here, Sir,\" pointing to a small\r\nrocky space at the bottom of the fall.  I had imagined, while thus going\r\nround and round as if on a tread mill, that I was walking straight\r\nforward down the stream, and I suppose my efforts to keep near the sound\r\nof the water misled me.  Though perfectly familiar with this part of the\r\nLong Mynd, I was so blind at this time, and everything looked so strange,\r\nthat I did not in the least recognise my position.  Finding I did not get\r\non very well, I determined now to try whether I could walk or crawl down\r\nthe actual stream itself where it had hollowed its way underneath the\r\ndrifts which overhung it, making a sort of low-arched tunnel, which I\r\nthought worth trying.  I soon found, however, that this was quite\r\nimpracticable, and that if I went on I should either be suffocated or\r\nhopelessly imbedded in the snow, and that then my utmost efforts would\r\nfail to extricate me.  It also occurred to me somewhat painfully, that if\r\nI lost my life, as I thought I inevitably must do now, my body would not\r\nbe found for days, or it might be weeks, if it were buried deep in the\r\nmountain of snow at the bottom of that valley; and I was anxious that\r\nwhat remained of me might be found soon, and that the dreadful suspense,\r\nwhich is worse than the most fearful certainty, might thus be spared to\r\nall those who cared about my fate.\r\n\r\nI was not, however, quite beat yet; so, retracing my steps, I determined\r\nonce more to leave the stream and make for the higher ground.  But a new\r\nmisfortune now befell me: I lost my boots.  They were strong laced boots,\r\nwithout elastic sides, or any such weak points about them.  I had\r\nobserved before that one was getting loose, but was unable to do anything\r\nto it from the numbness of my hands; and after struggling out of a deep\r\ndrift previous to reascending the hill, I found that I had left this boot\r\nbehind.  There was nothing for it but to go on without, and as my feet\r\nwere perfectly numbed from the cold, and devoid of feeling, I did not\r\nexperience any difficulty or pain on this account.  That boot was\r\nafterwards found on a ledge of rock near the waterfall.  I soon after\r\nlost the other one, or rather, I should say, it came off, and I could not\r\nget it on again, so I carried it in my hand some time, but lost it in one\r\nof my many severe falls.  The fact of the loss of my boots has astonished\r\nall those who have heard of it, and I believe has excited more comment\r\nthan any other part of my adventure.  I have even heard of its being a\r\nmatter of fierce dispute, on more than one occasion, whether laced boots\r\n_could_ come off in this way.  They do not seem to have become unlaced,\r\nas the laces were firmly knotted, but had burst in the middle, and the\r\nwhole front of the boot had been stretched out of shape from the strain\r\nput upon it whilst laboriously dragging my feet out of deep drifts for so\r\nmany hours together, which I can only describe as acting upon the boots\r\nlike a steam-power boot-jack.\r\n\r\nAnd so for hours I walked on in my stockings without inconvenience.  Even\r\nwhen I trod upon gorse bushes, I did not feel it, as my feet had become\r\nas insensible as my hands.  It had occurred to me now that I might be in\r\nthe Carding Mill valley, and that I would steer my course on that\r\nsupposition.  It was fortunate that I did so, for I was beginning to\r\nthink that I could not now hold out much longer, and was struggling in a\r\npart where the drifts were up nearly to my neck, when I heard what I had\r\nthought never to hear again--the blessed sound of human voices,\r\nchildren's voices, talking and laughing, and apparently sliding not very\r\nfar off.  I called to them with all my might, but judge of my dismay when\r\nsudden and total silence took the place of the merry voices I had so\r\nlately heard!  I shouted again and again, and said that I was lost, but\r\nthere was no reply.  It was a bitter disappointment, something like that\r\nof the sailor shipwrecked on a desert island, who sees a sail approaching\r\nand thinks that he is saved, when as he gazes the vessel shifts her\r\ncourse and disappears on the horizon, dashing his hopes to the ground.  It\r\nappeared, as I learned afterwards, that these children saw _me_, though I\r\ncould not see them, and ran away terrified at my unearthly aspect.\r\nDoubtless the head of a man protruding from a deep snow drift, crowned\r\nand bearded with ice like a ghastly emblem of winter, was a sight to\r\ncause a panic among children, and one cannot wonder that they ran off to\r\ncommunicate the news that \"there was the bogie in the snow.\"  Happily,\r\nhowever, for the bogie, he had noticed the direction from which these\r\nvoices came, and struggling forward again, I soon found myself\r\nsufficiently near to the Carding Mill to recognise the place, blind as I\r\nwas.  A little girl now ventured to approach me, as, true to the\r\ninstincts of her nature, the idea dawned upon her that I was no goblin of\r\nthe mountains, no disagreeable thing from a world beneath popped up\r\nthrough the snow, but a real fellow-creature in distress.  I spoke to her\r\nand told her that I was the clergyman of Ratlinghope, and had been lost\r\nin the snow on the hill all night.  As she did not answer at once, I\r\nsuppose she was taking a careful observation of me, for after a few\r\nmoments she said, \"Why, you look like Mr. Carr of Wolstaston.\"  \"I am Mr.\r\nCarr,\" I replied; whereupon the boys, who had previously run away, and,\r\nas I imagine, taken refuge behind the girl, came forward and helped me on\r\nto the little hamlet, only a few yards distant, where some half dozen\r\ncottages are clustered together round the Carding Mill.\r\n\r\nI was saved, at any rate, from immediate peril, though I fully expected\r\nthat serious illness must follow from my violent exertions and long\r\nexposure.  I was saved at all events from the death of lonely horror\r\nagainst which I had wrestled so many hours in mortal conflict, and\r\nscarcely knew how to believe that I was once more among my fellow-men,\r\nunder a kindly, hospitable roof.  God's hand had led me thither.  No\r\nwisdom or power of my own could have availed for my deliverance, when\r\nonce my sight was so much gone.  The Good Shepherd had literally, in very\r\ndeed, led the blind by a way that he knew not to a refuge of safety and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe good kind people at the Carding Mill, you may be sure, soon gathered\r\nround me in sympathising wonder, and I was quickly supplied with such\r\ncomforts as they could give.  I told them that I had had scarcely\r\nanything to eat since breakfast the day before (as I had been too much\r\nhurried to eat my luncheon before starting to Ratlinghope), and so tea\r\nand bread and butter were at once provided.  The former was very\r\ngrateful, but I could hardly eat the latter, as all feeling of hunger had\r\nleft me.  The good people were much shocked to find that I could not pick\r\nup a piece of bread and butter for myself, as I could neither feel it nor\r\nsee it; I believe they thought my sight was hopelessly gone.  I was,\r\nhowever, under no uneasiness myself on this score, as I was perfectly\r\nfamiliar with snow blindness, having seen cases of it in Switzerland, and\r\nknew that in all probability my eyes would get quite right again in a\r\nweek's time, as it turned out that they did.  They also discovered that\r\nthe middle finger of my right hand was terribly lacerated, and that the\r\nskin was completely stripped off the back of it.  This I knew to be a\r\nmuch more serious affair, as the frost had evidently got fast hold of it,\r\nand I thought it very likely that I should lose it.  This, however,\r\nseemed a very trifling matter to me then.  Had it been my right arm I\r\nshould have thought nothing of it, after so marvellous an escape.  I was\r\nprovided at the Carding Mill with a hat, boots, and dry stockings; and\r\nhaving rested about a quarter of an hour, set out again to Church\r\nStretton, about a mile distant.  A man from the cottage came with me, and\r\ngave me his arm, and with this assistance I accomplished the walk with\r\ncomparative ease.  I was so anxious to get home, that I almost felt as if\r\nI could have walked the whole way, though I do not suppose that I could\r\nreally have done so, my home being rather more than five miles off.\r\nArrived at the town, I sent my companion for medical assistance, and\r\nmyself made my way to the Crown Inn.  I could discern large objects\r\nsufficiently to find my way along the street, though all was blurred and\r\nindistinct, and the admission of light to my eyes was beginning to cause\r\nme extreme pain.  I ordered a fly immediately to take me as far as\r\npossible on my road home.  No vehicle of any description had been along\r\nthe turnpike road that day, and it was very doubtful how far a fly could\r\ngo, so it was arranged that we should be accompanied by a man on a saddle\r\nhorse, that I might ride when the fly could go no further, as I knew\r\nthat, under the most favourable circumstances, the last mile and a half\r\nof the road to Wolstaston would be inaccessible to wheels.\r\n\r\nOf course my adventure excited great interest at the Crown Hotel, when it\r\nwas fully understood what had happened to me.  It was just two o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon when I reached that place, and as I had left Ratlinghope at\r\nfour o'clock on the previous afternoon, I had been walking\r\nuninterruptedly for twenty-two hours, excepting the quarter of an hour I\r\nhad rested at the Carding Mill.  My good friends at the hotel discovered\r\nthat my clothes were very wet, for they had been frozen before and were\r\nnow thawed, so I was dressed up in the landlord's garments.  The effect\r\nmust have been very ludicrous, for he was a much stouter man than I was\r\nat any time, and now I had shrunk away to nothing.  It will not therefore\r\nbe wondered at that people when they saw me declared they should not have\r\nknown who I was.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon having come and dressed my finger, and warned me to keep away\r\nfrom the fire and hot water, and having prescribed some hot brandy and\r\nwater, I started in my fly on my homeward journey.  Very slow was our\r\nprogress.  We had taken spades with us, and many times the driver and the\r\nman who accompanied him had to dig a way for the fly to get through.  Most\r\ntrying was the long delay thus caused to a man who knew that in his own\r\nhome he must probably be reckoned among the dead; but there was no help\r\nfor it, and at last Leebotwood was reached, the place where the lane to\r\nWolstaston turned off from the main road, and where I was to leave the\r\nfly, and, as I hoped, ride home.\r\n\r\nThe Post Office is at Leebotwood, and having given orders there that any\r\nletters coming from my house should be stopped, I was helped on my horse,\r\nand, accompanied by the man, began to ascend the hill.  I had not gone a\r\nhundred yards, when it became evident that it would be impossible to ride\r\nfar, and that I should be obliged to walk again, so the horse was sent\r\nback to Leebotwood by a man whom we met, and I started again on my own\r\nfeet.  Just at this time we met another man coming down over the fields\r\nfrom Wolstaston.  He had letters with him to post; those letters were\r\nfrom my home.  They were to say that I had been lost in the snow storm,\r\nthat every effort had been made to find me, that they had proved\r\nfruitless, and that there was no hope left.  I sent this messenger back\r\nagain pretty quickly, and told him to go home as fast as he could and say\r\nI was coming.  This news reached the village about half an hour before I\r\ncould get up there myself, and as may be supposed there was great\r\nrejoicing.  So completely had all hope of my safety been given up, that\r\nto my people it seemed almost like a resurrection from the dead.\r\n\r\nThey had made the greatest efforts to find me.  Twice a party had gone up\r\nthe hill on the Sunday night to the limit of the enclosed ground, and\r\nstayed there calling and shouting, till, as one of them said to me, they\r\nfelt that if they had stayed there another ten minutes, they would have\r\nbeen frozen to death.  The second time they went up that night, they\r\nactually got on to the open moorland some two or three hundred yards, but\r\nhere they were in imminent danger of being lost themselves.  One of them\r\nindeed declared that he could not return, and would have been lost had\r\nnot his companions insisted on his struggling back with them.  Human\r\neffort could do no more, and they made their toilsome way home prostrated\r\nwith fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful moment, they tell me, when the Rectory house was closed\r\nup for the night, the shutters fastened, and curtains drawn, with the\r\nfate of its master unknown.  The helpless watchers could only wait and\r\ncount the weary hours, keeping food hot for the wanderer, who they feared\r\nwould never return, and unable till the morning to plan any further\r\nefforts for his rescue.  The awful wind raged on, sometimes assuming to\r\nthe ears of the excited listeners the sound of rolling wheels and horses'\r\nfeet, startling them into expectation, though they knew that the tramp of\r\nan army would have fallen noiseless on that depth of snow.  Then again,\r\nit rose like shrieks and wild calls of distress, and every now and then\r\nwould smite the house with a buffet, as though it would level it with the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe storm lulled at length, as the hours went slowly by.  Morning came\r\nand the men prepared to resume their almost hopeless search once more.\r\nThey started, about twenty strong, armed with spades and shovels, and\r\ndetermined first of all to cut their way to Ratlinghope, thinking that\r\nperhaps I had remained there all night.  They worked with all their\r\nmight, but the snow was deeper than ever, and their progress was\r\nlaborious and very slow.  Though they had started as soon as it was light\r\nin the morning, they did not reach Ratlinghope till noon, and then their\r\nlast hope was dashed to the ground, for they heard that I _had_ started\r\nthe previous afternoon, though pressed to remain in the village for the\r\nnight.  Great was the consternation of the Ratlinghope people when they\r\nheard the news.  They knew the hill well, and said with one consent, \"If\r\nMr. Carr was on the Long Mynd last night, he is a dead man.\"  This\r\nconviction too was strengthened by the sad fact, that that very morning\r\nthe dead body of a man, whom we all knew well, had been found in the road\r\nfrozen to death, not more than one hundred and fifty yards from a small\r\nhamlet in the parish of Ratlinghope, known as \"The Bridges.\"  Poor\r\nEasthope, for such was his name, was a journeyman shoemaker by trade.  He\r\nowned a few ponies which were on the hill, and he had been looking after\r\nthese on the Sunday.  I suppose he was much exhausted by this, but he had\r\nsafely reached his daughter's house in the evening, which he subsequently\r\nleft to go to the place where he worked, no great distance off.  He was\r\nfound, as I have said, the next morning frozen to death on the turnpike\r\nroad.  It is conjectured that he either sat down to rest or fell down,\r\nand that he speedily became insensible.  I think this fact in itself is\r\nsufficient to prove that, had I given way to the temptation to rest, I\r\ntoo should have lost my life.\r\n\r\nThe searching party, reinforced by most of the able-bodied men in\r\nRatlinghope, beat that part of the hill lying between Ratlinghope and\r\nWolstaston thoroughly, thinking that I must be somewhere in the tract\r\nbetween the two places, never supposing that I could have wandered as far\r\naway as I actually had done.  The fog was so thick that it was only by\r\nkeeping near to each other and shouting constantly that this party was\r\nable to keep together.  I need not say that they failed to discover any\r\ntrace of me, and about three o'clock in the afternoon, worn out and\r\nexhausted, they returned to the Rectory with the worst tidings.  \"He must\r\nbe dead,\" they said, \"he must _be_ dead; it is not possible that any\r\nhuman creature could have lived through such a night.\"  And it was upon\r\nthe receipt of these tidings that the letters were sent off which I so\r\nfortunately succeeded in stopping.  Half-an-hour after, the news came\r\nthat I was returning, and in another half-hour I was at home.  This was\r\nbetween four and five o'clock in the afternoon, rather more than twenty-\r\nseven hours from the time I had left Wolstaston.\r\n\r\nMy friends tell me that had they not known who it was, they would\r\nscarcely have recognised me.  Dressed in another man's clothes,\r\nexceedingly thin, with eyes fearfully bloodshot, and fingers stiff and\r\nshrunken, the middle finger more resembling a dead stick, they say, with\r\nthe gray and wrinkled bark on, than the living member of a human body,\r\nthis is scarcely to be wondered at.  I was glad to go to bed at once, and\r\nto have my feet and hands well rubbed with snow.  This, it should be well\r\nknown, is the only thing to be done in cases of frost bite.  Had I put\r\nthem in hot water, I should in all probability have lost my fingers and\r\ntoes; they would have sloughed off.  I know of several cases where this\r\nhas happened; indeed, I heard of one quite lately, for the gardener of a\r\nfriend of mine in Warwickshire had his hands frost-bitten while throwing\r\nthe snow off the roof of a house during this last winter, and\r\ninjudiciously putting them into hot water, the result has been that he\r\nhas lost the ends of all his fingers, to the first joint.  In my case, I\r\nam thankful to say I knew better than to do this, and by the use of cold\r\nwater and continued friction have succeeded in restoring my hands in a\r\ngreat measure.  They have still not nearly as much sensation in them as\r\nbefore, but this will return with time.  During the last few weeks, gorse\r\npricks have been working out of my hands and feet and legs by hundreds,\r\nthough at first, from the numbness of the skin, I was quite unconscious\r\nof them.  It is not to be wondered at that I should have picked these up\r\nin great numbers whilst walking through the gorse bushes without my\r\nboots, and clutching at them as I fell in hopes of saving myself.\r\n\r\nSuch are the details of my \"Night in the Snow,\" and my most wonderful\r\npreservation through it and the following day.  I trust that no one who\r\nmay chance to read these pages will ever be placed in a similar position;\r\nbut should it so happen, I hope that the remembrance of my adventure will\r\noccur to them; for surely it teaches, as plainly as anything can, that\r\neven in the most adverse circumstances no one need ever despair; and\r\nshows how an individual of no unusual physical powers may, by God's help,\r\nresist the overwhelming temptation to sleep which is usually so fatal to\r\nthose who are lost in the snow.\r\n\r\nLORIMER AND CHALMERS, PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.",
