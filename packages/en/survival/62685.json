Howard, secretary of the National Poultry and Pigeon Association.\r\nIt comprises an enumeration of the standard breeds of ducks and\r\ngeese, and contains suggestions for their management. The practical\r\ninformation contained in this bulletin will undoubtedly prove of value\r\nto persons engaged in raising ducks and geese, and its publication and\r\nwidespread distribution are respectfully recommended. The illustrations\r\nwere drawn by the author from original sketches and photographs, with\r\nthe exception of three of the cross-bred geese, which are after the\r\nillustrations published by the Rhode Island Experiment Station, and\r\nthe wild goose, which is after the illustration in Wright's Book of\r\nPoultry. The author has received generous assistance in treating of the\r\npractical details from James Rankin, A. J. Hallock, George H. Pollard,\r\nand others who are largely engaged an the raising of water fowls for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                       D. E.

Of these breeds, the first\r\nsix are considered profitable to raise; the two breeds of Calls and the\r\nBlack East Indian are bantams, and are bred more for the showroom; the\r\nCrested White may be considered as almost purely ornamental.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--White Pekin duck.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE PEKIN DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Of all ducks for farm and practical purposes none stand\r\nhigher in popular esteem than the White Pekin (fig. 1). It is valuable\r\nfor raising on a large scale, and is the most easily raised of any.\r\nIt is a very timid bird and must be handled quite carefully. It was\r\nimported from China in the early seventies, and has steadily grown in\r\npopularity since its introduction into this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Group of White Pekin ducks.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--The Pekin duck has a distinct type of its own, and\r\ndiffers from all others in the shape and carriage of its body. By some\r\nit is credited with having a shape much like an Indian canoe, owing to\r\nthe full growth of feathers under the rump and the singular turned-up\r\ncarriage of the tail. The legs are set far back, which causes the bird\r\nto walk in an upright position. In size these ducks are very large,\r\nsome reaching as high as 20 pounds to the pair. Their flesh is very\r\ndelicate and free from grossness, and they are considered among the\r\nbest of table fowls. They are excellent layers, averaging from 100 to\r\n130 eggs each in a season. They are nonsetters, hardy, easily raised,\r\nand the earliest in maturing of any ducks. The method given in this\r\nbulletin for raising ducks is based on the Pekin as a standard, and the\r\ntreatment, food, housing, etc., is given as used by the largest and\r\nmost successful raisers of Pekins. Other ducks are judged for practical\r\nqualities by the Pekin. Fig. 2 shows a group of White Pekin ducks.\r\n\r\nThe standard-bred Pekin has a long finely formed head, a bill of medium\r\nsize, of a deep yellow color, that is perfectly free from any mark or\r\ncolor other than yellow. The color of the bill is very important for\r\nexhibition birds, and it is not infrequent that one of the best ducks\r\nin a showroom is disqualified for having a faint tracing of black in\r\nthe bill. The eyes are of deep leaden-blue color. The neck of a Pekin\r\nshould be neatly curved; in the drake it should be large and rather\r\nlong, while that of the duck is of medium length. The back is long and\r\nbroad; breast is round, full, and very prominent. The body is long\r\nand deep, and the standard gives for adult birds a body approaching\r\nthe outlines of a parallelogram. The wings are short, carried closely\r\nand smoothly against the body. The birds can not sustain flight, a\r\n2-foot fencing being ample to restrain them in an inclosure. The tail\r\nis erect, more so than in any other specimen. The curled feathers in\r\nthe tail of the drake are hard and stiff. The thighs are short and\r\nlarge; shanks short and strong, and in color are a reddish orange; toes\r\nstraight, connected by a web, and reddish orange in color. The plumage\r\nis downy, and of a faint creamy white throughout. Recently it has been\r\nnoticed that preference in the showroom is being given to birds of\r\nwhiter plumage. The breeders are selecting as their show birds those\r\nthat have the snow-white plumage instead of the creamy white, as given\r\nin the standard.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 8 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 7 pounds; young drake, 7 pounds, and young duck, 6 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE AYLESBURY DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The White Aylesbury ducks (fig. 3.) are second to the\r\npopular Pekins for market purposes, and are bred in large numbers in\r\nEngland and Europe. In this country they are not so extensively bred\r\nas the Pekin, neither have they been found so good as the latter.\r\nThese ducks receive their name from Aylesbury, the county town of\r\nBuckinghamshire, England. They are of large size, pairs occasionally\r\nreaching the weight of 18 pounds, the male birds weighing 9 or 10\r\npounds, and the female 7 or 8. Birds weighing 15 to 16 pounds to the\r\npair are the average.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--The head of the Aylesbury duck is long and neatly\r\nformed; the eyes of a deep leaden-blue color; the long, wide bill is of\r\na pale flesh color or pinkish hue, and should be free from dark spots,\r\nbills marked with black being a disqualification; the neck is slender,\r\nlong, and gracefully curved; the body is long and oval; the breast is\r\nfull and round; the strong shanks are of brilliant light-orange color;\r\nthe wings are strong and nicely folded; the back is both long and\r\nbroad, and the tail formed of stiff, hard feathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Group of White Aylesbury ducks.]\r\n\r\nThe soft white plumage is one of the chief attractions of the Aylesbury\r\nbreed, and like most white plumage has a tendency to assume a yellow\r\nhue if exposed to the sun. The beak will also lose its delicate pink\r\nhue and become yellow if exposed to too much sunlight in summer. The\r\nbill of the Pekin should be yellow, but the bill of the Aylesbury\r\nshould be a delicate pink or flesh color, and birds intended for\r\nexhibition must possess this quality or they will suffer at the hands\r\nof the judge. Birds raised for exhibition purposes must be guarded\r\nagainst too much exposure to the sunlight in the summer. Of course,\r\nthese delicate points are of no consequence to the market poulterer\r\nother than to show the true type of the breed.\r\n\r\nFor farm purposes the Aylesbury is to be recommended, second only to\r\nthe Pekin; it possesses the many good qualities of the Pekin, and\r\ncan be bred with almost the same success. The advantages claimed for\r\nAylesbury are the ease with which it is acclimated, thriving in every\r\ncountry and climate; its early maturity; its great hardiness; its large\r\nsize; its great prolificacy, and the real beauty which it possesses.\r\nRaisers recommend for raising exhibition birds one drake to two ducks,\r\nor two drakes to five ducks, all being allowed to run together. Duck\r\nraisers who raise large numbers for market breed them as they do\r\nPekins, using from four to eight females to one male, according to the\r\nseason of the year. Fresh blood is introduced every year to keep up the\r\nsize, and breeding stock is seldom kept longer than the second or third\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Aylesbury being an English duck, it will be of interest to note the\r\nmethods employed in their native place for raising them, as given by an\r\nEnglish writer in the following statements:\r\n\r\n  In and about the town of Aylesbury very many of the cottagers\r\n  maintain, each of them, a set of ducks, about 4 ducks to a drake.\r\n  These they keep in any outbuilding attached to their dwellings and,\r\n  failing such a place, in the cottage itself.\r\n\r\n  From them the \"duckers\" (dealers peculiar to the trade) collect the\r\n  eggs, and generally bargain with the owners for their whole supply at\r\n  a given rate for the season. They begin their collection in October,\r\n  and the contract is often made for the whole produce up to June.\r\n  The breeding stock of a \"ducker\" who does an average trade consists\r\n  of six drakes and twenty ducks; these all run together, and the\r\n  brooks and ponds are looked upon almost as common property. They are\r\n  separated at night, driven up to their respective homes, well fed\r\n  and warmly housed. The eggs which were laid during the nighttime are\r\n  set, as soon as possible, under large and attentive hens, for which\r\n  purpose good Dorkings and Cochins are considered best. The ducks\r\n  themselves are never allowed to sit, though they may desire to do so,\r\n  as the result would be almost certain failure.\r\n\r\n  Thirteen eggs comprise a setting, and these are easily covered by\r\n  a large hen. Hens are set either in fish pads, small hampers, or,\r\n  in what we have found most serviceable, the round boxes in which\r\n  cheeses are packed. In the bottom of these is placed some lime or\r\n  wood ashes, and then a nest of hay or some soft straw; there the hens\r\n  must be kept as quiet as possible. Special care must be taken to\r\n  guard against the intrusion of rats or other vermin by which the hen\r\n  mother may be disturbed and, as is often the case, the whole setting\r\n  be destroyed thereby. The period of incubation is twenty-eight days,\r\n  and during the last week of that time care must be taken to sprinkle\r\n  the eggs daily with lukewarm water, which softens the shells, so that\r\n  when the time comes for the duckling to make its appearance it has\r\n  not much difficulty in breaking through its covering. When the young\r\n  are hatched they should be left with the hen until well nestled, well\r\n  dried, and strong enough to stand. Many scores of ducklings are lost\r\n  by inexperienced persons through their impatience to remove them from\r\n  the nest. The little duckling is at first clad with soft, yellow\r\n  down, which gradually disappears as the feathers grow. After a few\r\n  days, three or four broods are put together with one hen, which is\r\n  quite able to take care of them all.\r\n\r\n  For market purposes the treatment of the ducklings is as follows:\r\n  They are not allowed to go into any water, but are kept in hovels\r\n  or the rooms of cottages, each lot of thirty or forty separated by\r\n  low boards. It is no uncommon thing to see 2,000 or 3,000, all in\r\n  one establishment. They are kept very clean and dry on barley straw;\r\n  their food consists of hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine and mixed with\r\n  boiled rice and bullock's liver, cut Tip small. This is given to\r\n  them several times in the day for about a fortnight or more. When\r\n  they are capable of consuming more they are fed on barley meal and\r\n  tallow greaves (cracklings), mixed together with the water in which\r\n  the greaves previously have been boiled. Some poultrymen also use\r\n  horseflesh to mix with their other food. The above constitutes all\r\n  that is necessary to produce early ducklings for the table.\r\n\r\nIn plumage the Aylesburys are a pure, spotless white, and feathers\r\nof any other color will disqualify them. Drake and duck vary only in\r\nthe ordinary respect of the male bird, showing a very handsome curled\r\nfeather in the tail and being of a larger size than his mate.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 9 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 8 pounds; young drake, 8 pounds, and young duck, 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORED ROUEN DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The Colored Rouen duck (fig. 4) is deservedly popular\r\nthroughout this country, and is considered one of the most profitable\r\nbreeds to keep. These ducks are said to have come originally from\r\nthe city of Rouen, in Normandy. It is known that large quantities of\r\npoultry are raised in Normandy, and while there may be no positive\r\nproof that these ducks came originally from that city, large numbers\r\nof birds closely resembling them are to be found in the market places\r\nthere. Some writers contend that the name should be \"Roan,\" owing to\r\ntheir color, but the color itself does not support this contention. The\r\ncorrect name is Rouen, and \"Roan\" is undoubtedly a corruption.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--The Rouen duck is a fine market bird, but does not\r\nmature as early as does the Pekin or the Aylesbury. The flesh is\r\nconsidered very delicate, and the breed is acknowledged to be superior\r\nfor table purposes, being easily fattened. The Rouen will be found a\r\nprofitable bird to raise on the farm, being hardy, prolific, quiet in\r\ndisposition, and of beautiful plumage. Their eggs are not as large as\r\nthose of the Pekin, and are diverse in color.\r\n\r\nThe Rouen is undoubtedly closely related to the Mallard duck; its\r\nplumage alone would make good this belief. But the shape of the\r\ndomestic Rouen duck has been greatly modified from that of the wild\r\nMallard; the body is grown longer and heavier, with a tendency to drop\r\ndown in the rear; the wings have lost the power of flight which the\r\nwild ancestor possessed. The plumage, however, remains almost the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Trio of Colored Rouen ducks.]\r\n\r\nThe standard-bred Rouen drake has a long, finely-formed head, with\r\nrich, lustrous green plumage; bill long and broad, wider at the\r\nextremity, of greenish-yellow color, with a black bead at the tip;\r\nthe neck is long, slender, and neatly curved, covered with the same\r\nlustrous green plumage as the head, which is interrupted by a distinct\r\nwhite ring, not quite complete behind, on the lower part of neck. The\r\nback is long, the upper part being ashy gray, mixed with green, and\r\nrunning into a rich, lustrous green on the lower part and rump; the\r\nshoulder coverts are gray, striped with fine, wavy lines of brown. The\r\nbreast is broad and deep and purplish brown or claret color, perfectly\r\nfree from gray feathers; the claret color should extend down as far\r\nas possible toward the legs. The body is long, deep, and broad, the\r\nunder part and sides being a beautiful gray, which grows lighter near\r\nthe vent, ending in solid black just beneath the tail. The wings are\r\nshort and carried closely and smoothly against the sides; in color the\r\nwings are of a brownish gray, interspersed with green, and marked with\r\na band of rich purple, with metallic reflections of green and blue\r\nlights, and edged with distinct white bands; the primary feathers are\r\nof a dark, dusky brown. The tail feathers are hard and stiff, and of a\r\ndark ashy-brown color; the outer edge in old birds is edged with white;\r\nthe curled feathers are well curled and hard. The thighs are short and\r\nstout and of ashy-gray plumage; the shanks are short and strong, and\r\nin color orange with brownish tinge; the toes and webs are of the same\r\ncolor as the shanks.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Rouen duck, like that of the drake, is long and finely\r\nformed, but with a deep-brown plumage and two stripes of lighter brown\r\nextending from the beak to behind the eyes; bill, long, broad, and\r\nsomewhat flat, brownish orange in color, blotched with darker shade\r\nupon the upper part and ending in a black beam at the tip. The neck\r\nis neatly curved, long and slender, light brown in plumage, penciled\r\nwith a darker shade of the same color; unlike the drake, there is no\r\nwhite ring on the neck. The back is long, of a light-brown color richly\r\nmarked with green; breast, full and round and of dark-brown plumage,\r\npenciled with lighter brown; body, long, deep, and broad, the under\r\npart and sides of plumage being grayish brown, each feather penciled\r\nwith rich dark brown to the point of the tail. The wings are short for\r\nthe size of the bird and are carried closely against the sides; the\r\ncolor of the plumage is grayish brown, intermingled with green, with\r\nbars of purple edged with white, the colors being distinct; primaries\r\nare brown. The tail feathers are stiff and of a light-brown color,\r\ndistinctly marked with pencilings of dark greenish brown; tail coverts\r\nare brown, penciled with the same dark brown, or greenish brown, as the\r\ntail. The thighs are dark brown, penciled; and shanks, toes, and webs\r\nare orange or orange brown.\r\n\r\nBoth the Rouen drake and duck, clothed in plumage attractive and\r\npleasing to the eye, are as much fanciers' fowls as any of the\r\nvarieties of chickens, yet they are of much value as market birds.\r\nThe only objection to them, aside from their slow maturing qualities,\r\nis that of the dark pinfeathers. This should not stand against them\r\nany more than it does against the many valuable varieties of chickens\r\nthat have dark plumage and dark pinfeathers. To the farmer who intends\r\nraising ducks for market purposes they are to be recommended.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 9 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 8 pounds; young drake, 8 pounds, and young duck, 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK CAYUGA DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The black Cayuga (fig. 5) is distinctly an American duck,\r\nhaving been bred so long in this country that all trace of its origin\r\nis lost. It is said that it was first found in the central part of New\r\nYork, on Cayuga Lake. It was sometimes called the \"Big Black duck,\" and\r\nagain the \"Lake duck,\" but is now known only as the Black Cayuga duck.\r\nBy some it is supposed to have originally come from the wild Black\r\nduck, and another story has it that it was first found in Dutchess\r\nCounty, in the State of New York, where a miller was raising a flock of\r\nthirty, which, he said, were bred from a pair he had captured several\r\nyears previous in a mill pond. They were kept in the poultry yard,\r\neasily tamed, and built their nests on the edges of the pond and raised\r\nlarge broods. For many years the Cayuga has been raised in this country\r\nand has been considered by those who have bred it to be a profitable\r\nduck to keep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Pair of Black Cayuga ducks.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--By some raisers the Cayuga is considered to be as good\r\nas the Pekin for early markets, and the claim is made that it can be\r\ngrown as cheaply. This assertion is not verified by any practical\r\ndemonstration, as these ducks are rarely, if ever, seen on any farm\r\nwhere ducks are raised exclusively. Though raisers generally speak of\r\ntheir merits as making them profitable, and place them next to the\r\nPekin for early markets, they prefer the latter for exclusive duck\r\nraising where early maturity and plump carcasses are wanted. Their\r\nblack plumage is against them also, and many assign this as the reason\r\nwhy they are not more extensively bred. The farmer who desires a good,\r\npractical duck to raise on his farm in conjunction with other poultry\r\nwill find this a valuable bird to keep. More time can be spent in\r\ndressing it for market than is generally given to the dressing of the\r\nwhite-plumage birds, and the profits will be proportionately as great.\r\nDuck raisers, like broiler raisers, are partial to white feathers for\r\nmarket fowls, but those who do not look with this partiality on the\r\nwhite varieties will find an excellent choice in the Cayuga duck.\r\n\r\nCayugas are splendid birds for a restricted range and breed well in\r\nconfinement; they are quiet, docile, and form a strong attachment for\r\ntheir home, evincing no inclination or desire to stray far away from\r\nthe place where they were bred. They are hardy and prolific, producing\r\nfrom 80 to 90 eggs in the spring, and sometimes they also lay again\r\nin the autumn. They are easily kept in good condition, but if fed\r\ntoo liberally they will fatten too quickly and will become too heavy\r\nbehind. The ducklings are hardy and easy to raise, and attain good size\r\nand weight at an early age.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Cayuga is small, with glossy black plumage; bill rather\r\nshort and broad, of dark color, black being preferred; the eyes dark\r\nhazel. The neck is medium, gracefully curved, clad in black feathers\r\nwith a greenish luster; the back is broad, and the body long, well\r\nrounded, and very plump, the feathers being of a glossy black hue. The\r\nwings are long and are carried smoothly against the body, and are black\r\nin color, excepting those of the duck, which are sometimes of a dark\r\nbrown. The coverts of the drake are a very lustrous green black; the\r\ntail feathers are black, as are the thighs. Black shanks, toes, and\r\nwebs are preferred, though dark slate color is permissible according to\r\nthe standard requirements. The color of the plumage must be lustrous\r\nblack throughout, and feathers of any other color will disqualify a\r\nbird in the showroom.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 8 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 7 pounds; young drake, 7 pounds, and young duck, 6 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORED AND WHITE MUSCOVY DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Muscovy ducks (fig. 6) form a distinct genus, having\r\nseveral peculiarities or characteristics which make them different from\r\nothers. They are sometimes called the Musk duck, owing to the odor of\r\nmusk which pervades the skin, but which is not noticeable when cooked.\r\nThese ducks are found wild in the warmer regions of South America. In\r\nBrazil they are extensively domesticated and are prized very highly\r\nfor eating. In this country and Europe, particularly in Germany, they\r\nare bred in large numbers. Wild Muscovies are easily frightened and\r\nvery good flyers; they fly into trees when alarmed and remain there for\r\nlong periods of time before leaving their place of concealment. They\r\nsometimes build their nests in branches of trees, and also in hollows\r\nnear water.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--Muscovy ducks are very unsatisfactory birds to keep\r\non the farm with other poultry, owing to their quarrelsome and\r\npugnacious natures. In the wild state, before pairing, the males\r\ntight desperately, doing great harm to each other; and this fighting,\r\nquarrelsome disposition is inherited by the domestic duck. The temper\r\nof the drake is spoken of as abominable; his persecution of other\r\npoultry is never ceasing, and he is credited with having attacked\r\neven children when his \"dander was up.\" The flesh of the Muscovy is\r\nconsidered very good when eaten young, and compares favorably with that\r\nof any other duck. They do not lay nearly so many eggs as the common\r\nkinds. When bred they must be kept in yards by themselves, and their\r\nwings must be clipped to keep them from flying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Pair of White Muscovy ducks.]\r\n\r\nThe head of the Muscovy duck is rather long, and in the drake it is\r\nlarge, the top being covered with long crest-like feathers, which rise\r\nand fall when the bird is alarmed. The bill is of medium length and\r\nvery stout. The face is the most distinctive part of these ducks, the\r\ncheeks being naked, with a scarlet, fleshy space around the eyes, and\r\nthe base of the bill carunculated also with scarlet folds. This large,\r\nred face gives them a savage appearance, and to some it is hideous. The\r\nneck is well curved and of medium length; back broad and flat, breast\r\nfull and broad, and body long and broad. The wings are very long and\r\nstout, and the tail is rather long, with abundance of stiff feathering.\r\nThe drake does not have the curled feathers in the tail, as do other\r\nducks.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of Muscovy ducks, the colored and the white.\r\nThe head of the Colored Muscovy is glossy black and white; the bill\r\nis dark horn in color; eyes, brown; the back in color of plumage is\r\nlustrous blue black, which is sometimes broken with white; the color\r\nof the breast and body is the same as that of the back. The wing\r\ncoverts are rich, lustrous green black, and the tail feathers may be\r\neither black or white, the latter being preferred. The thighs, like the\r\ntail feathers, may be either black or white, white being preferred;\r\nthe shanks, toes, and webs vary in color from yellow to dark lead or\r\nblack. The White Muscovy in color of plumage is pure white throughout;\r\nfeathers of any other color will disqualify the bird for show purposes.\r\nThe eyes in the white variety are of a leaden-blue or gray color, while\r\nthose of the colored are brown. The shanks, toes, and webs are of a\r\npale-orange or yellow color.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 10 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 8 pounds; young drake, 8 pounds, and young duck, 7 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY AND WHITE CALL DUCKS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Pair of White Call ducks.]\r\n\r\n=History.=--Call ducks are bantams, and are bred more for the fancy\r\nthan for the profit there is in them for market. There are two kinds\r\nof Call ducks, the Gray Call and the White Call (fig. 7), and it is\r\nonly a choice of plumage as to which is the better of the two. They are\r\nboth of one character as to size, shape, and habits, and differ only\r\nas regards color. The Gray Call is very similar in color of plumage\r\nto the Rouen, and is indeed called by many the Bantam Rouen, and the\r\nWhite is generally called the Bantam Pekin. Their uses are only for\r\nthe showroom, or as decoy ducks for wild-duck shooting. For the latter\r\npurpose they are sometimes crossed with the common \"puddle duck\" or\r\nwith the wild Mallard. This latter cross is considered excellent, the\r\nprogeny being distinguished for tameness and domesticity.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--When breeding Call ducks, smallness of size is the\r\nfirst consideration; the smaller they are bred the better. The arts\r\nof skillful breeding for the showroom are being used in keeping down\r\nthe size of these ducks. Inbreeding has been resorted to, while late\r\nhatching, scanty feeding, and nonbone-making food have been the means\r\nthat have retarded their natural development.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Call duck is full and round; bill, short and broad;\r\nneck of medium length, and back comparatively short; the breast is\r\nround and full, and body short, round, and compact, with medium-sized\r\nwings; the thighs are short and stout, and shanks short.\r\n\r\nThe Gray Call drake is a beautiful little bird, with a rich, lustrous\r\ngreen head, dark-hazel or brown eyes, lustrous green neck, with a\r\nwhite ring on the lower part of neck, as in the Rouen. The back is of\r\nashy-gray plumage mixed with green on the upper part, while the lower\r\npart and rump are a rich, lustrous green. The under part of the body on\r\nthe sides is a beautiful gray, which grows lighter toward the vent, and\r\nends in solid black under the tail. The wings are grayish brown, mixed\r\nwith green, and have the broad ribbon-like mark of rich purple with\r\nmetallic reflections of green and blue, distinctly edged with white.\r\nThe primaries are a dark, dusky brown. The tail feathers are of a dark,\r\nashy brown, the outer web in old birds being edged with white; the\r\ntail coverts are black, with very rich purple reflections. The bill is\r\ngreenish yellow in color, while the shanks, toes, and webs are orange,\r\nwith a brownish tinge.\r\n\r\nThe duck's head is deep brown, and has two pale-brown stripes on each\r\nside, like the head of the Rouen duck, running from the bill to a\r\npoint behind the eyes. Her bill is of a brownish-orange color, and her\r\neyes are dark hazel or brown. The neck is light brown, penciled with\r\ndarker brown; breast, dark brown, penciled with lighter brown; back,\r\nlight brown, marked with green, and the under parts and sides of body\r\nare grayish brown, each feather distinctly penciled with rich dark\r\nbrown. The plumage of wing is grayish brown, mixed with green, and is\r\ncrossed by a broad bar of rich purple edged with white; the primaries\r\nare brown. The tail feathers are of a light-brown color, with distinct,\r\nbroad, wavy penciling of dark greenish brown; tail coverts are brown,\r\nwith broad penciling of dark brown or greenish brown; thighs are dark\r\nbrown; shanks, toes, and webs are orange brown.\r\n\r\nThe White Gall is pure white in plumage throughout, and feathers of any\r\nother color will disqualify it. It is in every respect like the Gray\r\nCall except in plumage, in the color of the eyes, which are a gray or\r\nblue, and the color of the shanks, which are a bright orange.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--No standard weight is given for Call ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK EAST INDIAN DUCKS.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Another standard breed of ducks which is hardly considered\r\na rival of the Pekin, Aylesbury, Cayuga, or Rouen, is the Black East\r\nIndian. This duck bears the same relation to those just named as does\r\nthe bantam to the larger varieties of chickens. The Black East Indian\r\nand the Call ducks are the bantam breeds of ducks, being bred more for\r\ntheir smallness of size than for their profitableness. The same devices\r\nare resorted to in breeding them as were mentioned for breeding the\r\nCall ducks.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--The East Indian duck is hardy, and would, if carefully\r\nbred from the largest and best specimens, grow to a fairly good size,\r\nand be profitable to keep. In weight they seldom grow larger than 2\r\nto 2½, pounds each. The close inbreeding to which they have been\r\nsubjected has been detrimental to their egg production, while those\r\nstrains which have not been so closely bred have proved very prolific.\r\nIt may be said in favor of these ducks, that if allowed to increase in\r\nsize, which they will readily do under favorable circumstances, they\r\nwould prove very profitable to those who prefer keeping small-sized\r\nbirds to the larger ones.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian duck is very shy in its habits, and is given to long\r\nflights, but if attention is shown them in feeding they become attached\r\nto their home surroundings. They can not be successfully bred in\r\nconfinement; their natures are roaming and they like freedom of life.\r\nThe first eggs of a litter laid by these ducks are sooty or nearly\r\nblack in color, but they gradually grow lighter until they assume the\r\ncolor common to the eggs of most varieties. They are splendid sitters,\r\nand will invariably steal their nests if permitted to do so, but the\r\nduck and brood when hatched should be confined for a couple of weeks,\r\nthat the young may not be exposed until they have gained some strength\r\nand size.\r\n\r\nThe head of the black East Indian duck is short and small; eyes dark\r\nhazel; bill rather short. The head of the drake is of a dark yellowish\r\ngreen, free from all spots or blemishes, and the duck's head is very\r\ndark, almost black. The exact coloring of the bill of the drake is\r\nconsidered of the utmost importance. It is described by an enthusiast\r\nas being a sort of pale yellow, washed over with blackish green,\r\nthe color being laid on thinly, as it were, so as to give an almost\r\ntransparent effect, and shaded off at the tip into a kind of slate\r\ncolor. By another raiser the color of the bill is described as an olive\r\ngreen. The neck is neatly curved and short; back, of good length and\r\nmedium width. The breast is full, round, and plump. The body is long\r\nand comparatively small; wings of medium length and nicely folded; tail\r\nshort, and in the drake has the curled feathers. The thighs are short\r\nand stout, and shanks are short and rather small.\r\n\r\nThe plumage is a rich black, with a brilliant greenish tint throughout.\r\nThe color of the plumage is of much worth to the beauty of these\r\nducks; it must be intensely black, rich in greenish' reflections,\r\nand perfectly free from white. The plumage upon the neck, back, and\r\nshoulder coverts will show more of the green than will the underparts,\r\nthe coloring of the drake surpassing that of the duck.\r\n\r\nIt is seemingly a difficult matter to breed specimens of the required\r\ncolor of plumage; more especially is it so with the duck, whose plumage\r\nis likely to be of a brownish tint. These ducks are quite likely to\r\nshow more or less white in plumage. The white feathers usually appear\r\nabout the eyes and also upon the breast. Birds that have been free\r\nfrom white as ducklings have been known to molt almost pure white. The\r\nducklings when first hatched are black, with a shade of yellow on the\r\nbreast, and with jet-black feet, shanks, and bill.\r\n\r\nWhen breeding these ducks use two females to one male, and the eggs\r\nwill prove very fertile. The young will be very hardy after five or six\r\nweeks of age, and there should be no trouble in rearing them after that\r\ntime. Give the youngsters free range and they will find nearly their\r\nwhole living in grasses, insects, etc.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--There is no standard weight given for Black East Indians;\r\nthe smaller their size the higher they rank for exhibition purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRESTED WHITE DUCKS.\r\n\r\n_History._--The Crested White duck (fig. 8) is what may be called an\r\nornamental duck, much the same as Polish chickens. They are not bred\r\nto any great extent in this country, and they are very seldom seen in\r\nthe showrooms. They have no especial value to the farmer, as better and\r\nmore easily-bred birds are to be found in the Pekin and Aylesbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Pair of Crested White ducks.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--These ducks have a medium-sized head; medium-sized\r\nbill; a large, well-balanced crest upon the crown of the head; a rather\r\nlong neck; a medium-length back; breast, round and full; body, round\r\nand of medium length; medium-length wings that smoothly fold; hard,\r\nstiff tail feathers, with well-curled feathers in the tail of drake;\r\nand short and stout thighs and shanks. Their eyes are large and bright\r\nand of a deep leaden blue or gray color. The shanks, toes, and webs are\r\nof a light-orange color.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult drake is 7 pounds; adult\r\nduck, 6 pounds; young drake, 6 pounds, and young duck, 5 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF DUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck raising has been developed within the last ten years into a\r\nflourishing industry. Prior to that time the duck was not considered\r\na profitable fowl to raise; its flesh was never prized very highly\r\nby the masses. Ducks were raised without constraint in waterways,\r\nfeeding mostly on fish and water insects. This food gave the flesh a\r\nstrong fishy flavor; hence it was not particularly sought after, save\r\nby the few who were partial to that class of diet. The duck centers\r\nof Long Island and New England were then producing a limited number\r\neach season, and it was with difficulty that these were sold with any\r\nprofit. In fact, one of the most prominent duck raisers may be quoted\r\nas saying that he was obliged to visit the city markets personally and\r\ntease the dealers to purchase his birds, in order to secure anything\r\nlike satisfactory prices.\r\n\r\nArtificial incubation and brooding, combined with judicious feeding,\r\nhave been instrumental in the development of the industry. Machinery\r\nhas enabled the duck raiser to accomplish his ambition of having his\r\nstock in the markets when prices are the best, and also of raising\r\nlarge numbers of birds in a limited space of time. The season for\r\nraising ducks is about six months--from February to July. The methods\r\nemployed by the most successful raisers will be given in this bulletin,\r\nand the most approved buildings, appliances, feeding, and care will be\r\ntreated in detail.\r\n\r\nDuck raising is to be recommended to farmers as a profitable source of\r\nrevenue; and by careful attention to the work, as knowledge increases,\r\nthe scope of the industry may be extended. There are numbers of farms\r\nin this country to-day that are devoted exclusively to raising ducks,\r\naveraging from 5,000 to 20,000 ducks as an annual output. An idea of\r\nthe proportions of the business may be had from the fact that as high\r\nas three tons of feed are used daily by a single raiser during the\r\nbusy season. The profits are the very best, and good incomes may be\r\nmade when once the business is thoroughly mastered. But the reader\r\nshould not jump imprudently to the conclusion that these results can be\r\neasily obtained. Duck raising is an arduous task; one that requires an\r\napprenticeship and absolute knowledge of the business before success is\r\nreached. Those who have been successful in raising ducks have learned\r\nthe business much as one does any other vocation. The beginner should\r\nstart modestly, and increase his plant as his knowledge of the work\r\nincreases. The average farmer has all the facilities for raising a\r\ngoodly number of ducks, and may with a little outlay add considerably\r\nto his income.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all necessary that ducks should have access to water to\r\nbe raised successfully; they grow and thrive as readily without. There\r\nare successful plants where thousands of ducks are raised that have no\r\nwater, save that which is given them as drink. It has been a matter of\r\nmuch dispute which is the better way. Some duck raisers use water and\r\nallow their breeders the freedom of it; some allow their growing stock\r\nintended for market free access to water until they are eight weeks\r\nold, when they are penned and fattened for market. On the other hand,\r\nthere are raisers who have no water on their farms, excepting wells,\r\nwho are just as successful and raise as many birds as those who have\r\nthe water. The only noticeable difference between \"upland\" and \"water\"\r\nducks is that the latter are of prettier and cleaner plumage than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Plans for a duck plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARTING A PLANT.\r\n\r\nA duck plant should be located on a line of railroad in direct\r\ncommunication with the city markets, and not too far from the station.\r\nAlmost any location will do for the plant, and worn-out land, that\r\ncan be had cheap, will do as well as the richer and more fertile land\r\ncosting several times as much. Sandy sod is to be preferred. The\r\nbuildings should be arranged to secure good drainage and be convenient\r\nto each other, that labor may be reduced to a minimum. The labor\r\nattached to raising poultry is an item that is overlooked by many, and\r\nthe cost of it often reduces very notably the earnings of the plant.\r\n\r\nEvery department of the plant should be so located as to economize the\r\ntime of the attendants. The incubator cellar should be convenient to\r\nthe brooder house, the brooder house to the growing house and pens,\r\nand these to the killing house. The feed house should be located\r\nconveniently to the brooder and growing houses and the breeding pens.\r\nThe task of feeding the growing stock four times a day and the breeding\r\nstock twice a day is no small one. Watering is also to be thought about.\r\n\r\nThe exact arrangement of a plant suited to all locations can not be\r\ngiven, as each locality differs from others in some respect, and\r\nwhat may be suitable for one will hardly do for the other. The plans\r\nof no two of the largest plants are alike. They differ in location\r\nof the buildings to suit the lay of the land; but they all have the\r\nsame general idea of the convenience of each building to the others.\r\nIllustration of this will be seen in fig. 9. When laying out a plant,\r\nmake provisions for future enlargement; allow plenty of room on all\r\nsides to extend the buildings without rendering inconvenient the work\r\nthat will be necessary to attend to the additional stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS FOR BREEDING DUCKS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--House for breeding ducks.]\r\n\r\nHouses for ducks are single affairs. They are built plain and\r\ncomfortable, and have no furnishings whatever. A duck is differently\r\nconstituted from a hen, and must be cared for under different\r\nconditions. The hen needs warmer houses and drier surroundings than\r\ndoes the duck. A duck does not mind the cold, if she can keep her\r\nfeet warm; cold feet will affect a duck as a frozen comb does a hen,\r\nretarding laying and inducing ailments. The feathers of a duck are\r\nalmost impenetrable and will withstand almost any degree of cold.\r\nAgain, a duck can not stand the amount of confinement in a house that a\r\nhen can; she is more restless in disposition and is given to exercise\r\nin a greater degree than is a hen. Indigestion is not so prevalent with\r\nducks as with chickens; the duck's ceaseless motion aids the digestive\r\norgans and keeps her generally in good health.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 10 is shown a simple house that may be built at small expense.\r\nIt is plain and has a shed roof. Such a house should be built of rough\r\nboards, 12 inches by 1 inch, and joints covered by 3-inch by 1-inch\r\nstrips. The roof should be made water-tight and covered with tarred\r\npaper, shingles, or tin. The outside should be well drained around the\r\nbottom, that it may not be damp. Some advocate board floors, raised\r\nfrom 6 to 8 inches from the ground and covered from 4 to 6 inches\r\nwith dry earth, straw, or leaves. The writer favors the using of\r\nboard floors in all houses for chickens, but thinks it not essential\r\nfor ducks. If the house is well drained on the outside and the earth\r\nfloor is covered with hay, straw, or leaves, it will be perfectly\r\nsatisfactory. There must not be dampness in the house, as the birds\r\nwill not do so well; while they are given to water on the outside they\r\nmust have comfortable quarters in which to \"warm up,\" or \"dry out.\"\r\n\r\nThe building shown in fig. 10 may be constructed of any dimensions\r\ndesired, according to the size of flock to be kept. A house 12 by 14\r\nfeet will accommodate nicely a flock of a dozen. There are no interior\r\narrangements whatever, simply the floor surface of the building. It is\r\nbetter not to use nests. Some raisers use a plain nest, as shown in\r\nfig. 11. These nests are made of 1-inch boards, 12 inches high and 16\r\ninches long, set 14 inches apart, and held together in front with a\r\n3-inch strip. The nests are nailed to the back of the house. But more\r\nthan half the eggs are laid on the floor of the house or in the yard,\r\nand, if permitted, a duck will build herself a nest to her liking.\r\nAgain, a duck is liable to injure herself by falling over the strips in\r\nfront of nests or other obstructions that may be in the house. In fig.\r\n12 is shown the nest of a wild duck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Nests for ducks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Nest of wild duck.]\r\n\r\nWhen two or more breeding pens are to be kept, the plan of the house\r\nshown in fig. 10 may be extended to any length desired, as shown in\r\nfig. 13. In figs. 14 and 15 are shown two more designs of duck houses,\r\nwhich are practical and cheap, and may be built singly or in rows for\r\na number of pens. Either of these houses, and also that shown in fig.\r\n10, make excellent breeding houses for the farmer to keep ducks in.\r\nAn inclosure should be given the breeding ducks, as they do better\r\nconfined than when at liberty. Give plenty of room and inclose the run\r\nwith 2-inch wire mesh 2 feet wide. If water is accessible, it should be\r\ninclosed by the mesh-wire fencing of the same width as for the run. In\r\nfig. 16 is shown a duck house with water runs, and also the arrangement\r\nof wire runs in the water. This is an admirable plan for farmers who\r\nhave running water on their farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROODING HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe general construction of a brooder house is similar to that of the\r\nbreeding house, and differs only in interior arrangements. The latter\r\nhas no interior arrangements whatever, while the former has the system\r\nof heating and covers necessary for giving warmth to the young stock.\r\nIn fig. 17 is shown a design of single-brooder house and ground plan\r\nthat is generally used by duck raisers. This house should be built\r\nupon a good foundation and be entirely proof against rats. A good plan\r\nis to sink half-inch wire mesh about 2 feet in the ground and around\r\nthe entire inside of the building; this will make it perfectly secure\r\nagainst rats and mice.\r\n\r\nThe accepted plan of a brooder house makes it 15 feet wide and as long\r\nas desired. The building is 4 feet high in front and 5 feet in rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND PLAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Plan and ground plan of five-pen breeding\r\nhouse for ducks.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is divided into pens 12 feet long and 6 feet wide, and has a 3 foot\r\npassageway extending the entire length of the building. The ground plan\r\n(fig. 17) shows the general arrangement of the interior and location of\r\nthe brooders.\r\n\r\nThe brooder box is next to the passageway, or walk, and runs the entire\r\nlength of the building. This box is 30 inches wide and 8 inches high;\r\nthe sides are 7 inches high and nailed securely; the top of the cover\r\nis nailed across with cleats to make it substantial, and the cover\r\nhas an inch strip nailed underneath in front and back to keep it in\r\nposition. These strips rest against the 7-inch sides and make the\r\nbrooder snug and tight when closed. The heating pipes are directly\r\nbeneath the cover and are 2-inch pipes, flow and return. Some prefer\r\n1-inch pipes, using two flows and two returns. When three pipes are\r\nused they should be about 8 inches apart from center to center. These\r\npipes rest on the partition boards of the pens. The front of the\r\nbrooder, leading into the pens, is cut out in the center about 4 inches\r\ndeep and 4 feet long (fig. 18, _A_), while the ends and the other side\r\nare solid, being 7 inches high. The construction of the brooder is\r\nclearly shown in fig. 18, _B_, with cover removed, while fig. 18, _C_,\r\nshows cover. The heater is located at the end of building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--House for breeding ducks.]\r\n\r\nAnother plan of brooder house is that shown in fig. 19. This house\r\nis known as a double brooder house, with walk in the center and pens\r\non either side, and with heater at the end. Many prefer this plan to\r\nthe single brooder house, as the care and attention required for the\r\nyoungsters is much less and the cost of heating is reduced, one heater\r\nbeing sufficient for both lines of pipes. Then, again, this latter plan\r\nshortens the length of the building by one-half and makes the work more\r\nconcentrated. The arrangement of the interior is the same as that of\r\nthe single brooder house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--House for breeding and growing ducks.]\r\n\r\nThe plans of brooder houses, as given above, are for ducklings from\r\nthe time they are taken from the machines until they are ready for the\r\ncold brooder, or growing house. The young ducklings, when taken from\r\nthe nest or incubator, are very delicate and susceptible to the changes\r\nof the atmosphere; they must be kept very warm and free from chilling.\r\nThe first three weeks of a duckling's life is the most critical period,\r\nand after that time the liabilities of loss are reduced to a very low\r\nrate--hardly five to the hundred. The front of brooders for young\r\nducklings should be hung with strips of woolen cloth to keep in the\r\nwarmth of the brooder. The greatest care should be given them at this\r\nperiod; the duck raisers really consider it the most important part of\r\ntheir work, and after a bird has passed the \"critical age\" they may be\r\ncounted on for the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--House for breeding ducks, showing water runs.]\r\n\r\nUsually the care of the ducklings at this age is given to the women.\r\nThey are more careful of the wants of the youngsters and attend to the\r\ndetail work religiously. A case is known of a single attendant living,\r\nas it were, in the brooder house with the ducklings. She began her\r\nwork with the morning feed at 6 a. m., and until sundown, when the\r\nnight's meal was given, she was with her charges. The cleanliness of\r\nthe brooder and pen was carefully attended to and everything was done\r\nto promote the health and comfort of the youngsters. At night they were\r\nall in their brooders and as snug as it was possible for them to be.\r\nA single neglect in the starting of a duckling will result in loss to\r\nthe raisers. System is the key to the situation, and there should be no\r\ndeviation from it whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Single brooder houses and ground plan.]\r\n\r\nThe duckling goes from the warm brooder house to the cold brooder\r\nhouse. The latter house is planned in a way similar to the former, with\r\nthe exception of the 30-inch brooders. When the birds are taken from\r\nthe warm brooder house they are three weeks old and of sufficient age\r\nto withstand a cooler temperature. They do not need the extra heat of\r\nthe warm house, and in it would not grow nearly so well. The size of\r\npens in the growing house is larger, and the ducklings are not crowded\r\nso many in a pen. If the birds are to be raised in colonies of one\r\nhundred each, the accommodations should be ample for them. It has never\r\nbeen proved to be good policy to crowd the growing stock; it retards\r\ntheir growth and encourages disease.\r\n\r\nThe cold brooder house should have a system of heating if birds are to\r\nbe raised for an early market. The same system of pipes used in the\r\nwarm brooders should be run around the sides of the building, about 2\r\nor 3 feet from the floor. This will give sufficient heat for the house\r\nand keep the birds comfortable. These pipes may be connected with the\r\nsame heater used for running the warm brooder pipes. In the Northern\r\nStates, in extremely cold weather, raisers also use the heating pipes\r\nin the warm brooder house in addition to the cold brooder pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Plans of brooder.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent plan is shown in fig. 20 for the arrangement of the heater\r\nfor connecting the pipes in the warm and cold double brooder house. It\r\nwill be seen that the heater is placed in the center of the building;\r\nthe warm brooder house is shown on the right and the cold brooder house\r\nwith runs attached is shown on the left, and pipes, indicated by dotted\r\nlines, run in both directions. This is the most economical house to\r\nbuild and lessens the work in attending the stock. The room in the\r\ncenter of the building will be found very useful and is generally used\r\nas the feed room. The heater is in the cellar beneath this room. This\r\nplan is used by one of the largest and most successful raisers of ducks\r\non Long Island, and it has his highest indorsement.\r\n\r\nThe building may be of any size, the plan being as successfully carried\r\nout on a large scale as on a small one. If a small building is used at\r\nfirst, it may be enlarged on either end to suit the growing business,\r\nand extended upward of 100 feet in either direction, thus making the\r\nbuilding more than 200 feet in length. The heater must be considered,\r\nwhen put in, with this object in view. A heater capable of heating the\r\n200-foot house can easily be regulated to heat one of 50 feet, but a\r\nheater that will heat properly only a 50-foot or 100-foot house would\r\nbe insufficient to heat the larger one.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between the cold brooder house and the warm brooder\r\nhouse is that the former has outside runs attached. These runs are\r\nused for feeding and watering when the weather permits, instead of\r\nthe feeding troughs inside the house. The ducks should be allowed the\r\nfreedom of the outside runs as soon as the weather is suitable. Ducks\r\nlike a life in the outer world, and they will grow more rapidly there\r\nthan when they are confined to the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Plans of a double brooder house.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Plan of a double brooder house, showing\r\narrangement of beating pipes.]\r\n\r\nDucklings are kept in the cold brooder house until they are six or\r\nseven weeks old, when they are transferred to large quarters known as\r\ngrowing houses. It is here that they are pushed for the market until\r\nthey are 10 weeks old, when they are salable. There is no heat in the\r\ngrowing houses, which are used only as a means of shelter during the\r\nearly spring months. When the weather is well advanced, the ducks\r\nseldom take to the houses at night; they prefer the outside and spend\r\ntheir nights on the ground. The growing houses should be abundantly\r\nventilated, as too close an atmosphere will do more harm in a single\r\nnight than if they had not been housed at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--House for growing Ducks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Two-pen house for growing ducks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Three-pen house for growing ducks.]\r\n\r\nA Pekin duck at 10 weeks is quite large, weighing close to 4 pounds.\r\nIt is quite as large as a full-grown duck of some of the other breeds.\r\nIn the space of two or three weeks from the time the ducklings are\r\nplaced in the growing houses they will be marketed at the weight of 4\r\nto 5½ pounds each. This weight is easily obtained, and when reached\r\nthe profitable time to sell has arrived, as they then command the best\r\nprices. Often a bird kept after this time loses in weight and becomes\r\nunprofitable. The growing houses are built after the plan of the\r\nbreeding houses, only much smaller. They need not be more than 4 or 5\r\nfeet high in rear and 1 or 2 feet high in front. Such a house is shown\r\nin fig. 21. This and other houses shown in figs. 22 and 23 may be built\r\nsingly or in rows, with 12-inch boards separating the runs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLYING WATER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Gutter water trough.]\r\n\r\nAs has been previously stated, water for bathing is not at all\r\nnecessary for growing ducks, but a liberal supply for drinking is\r\nabsolutely essential to their growth. The food of the duck is such as\r\nto require drink when eating, as it is comparatively dry and can not be\r\neaten hurriedly as grain is. When feeding, always replenish the water\r\ntroughs or fountains with pure, fresh water.\r\n\r\nA duck when feeding will eat a small quantity and go to the water\r\ntroughs, for drink, repeating this performance several times during the\r\nmeal. Conveniences for supplying drinking water to breeding and growing\r\nducks are varied, and almost any contrivance will answer the purpose.\r\nWhen small numbers of ducks are kept, the simplest method of supplying\r\nwater is in wooden troughs. These may be built V-shape or with square\r\nbottoms. They are shown in figs. 24 and 25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Flat water trough.]\r\n\r\nFor smaller ducks, those kept in the warm brooder house, the fountain\r\nplan is to be preferred, as the youngsters can not get into the water\r\nand become wet or chilled. These fountains may be made of air-tight\r\ncans for the reservoir and a tin plate 2 inches larger in diameter than\r\nthe can. A tomato can and an ordinary tin pie plate make an excellent\r\nfountain. Remove the top of the can and punch a small hole in the side\r\nabout a quarter of an inch from the free top edge; fill the can with\r\nwater and place it inverted on the plate. The water will run out until\r\nit reaches in the plate the level of the hole in the can. The plate\r\nwill not overflow and water will be supplied automatically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Plan for supplying water by pipes.]\r\n\r\nSome raisers use a pan--a pie plate, for instance--and place a stone\r\nseveral inches smaller in diameter than the pan in the center, leaving\r\na margin for water around the edge.\r\n\r\nWhen large numbers of birds are kept, it is of course necessary that a\r\nsystem for watering be adopted for saving labor. A practical system in\r\nuse is where the water is supplied by 1-inch pipes and having a cock\r\nin each pen directly over the water trough. Fig. 26 shows a diagram\r\ndrawing of this plan. The flow of the cocks is regulated by having\r\nthe one in the first pen run very slowly and gradually increasing the\r\nflow of the water in each pen. Thus all the troughs will be full at\r\nthe same time. The pipe should rest on top of the fencing about 2 feet\r\nhigh which divides the runs. This plan of watering can also be used in\r\nbrooder houses to good advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe food of the duck is both vegetable and animal in nature. In the\r\nwild state it gathers its food from brooks and marshes, consisting\r\nof flag, grasses, small fishes, water insects, etc. When the birds\r\nare raised in confinement this diet must, in a measure, be imitated\r\nto get the most satisfactory results. The duck has no crop, the food\r\npassing directly from the throat to the gizzard, and as a consequence\r\nthe food must be in a soft mushy state. Too much hard food, such as\r\ngrain, does not agree with these birds and they can not thrive on it.\r\nWhile some raisers use a small allowance of grain others do not, and\r\nit has not been proved to be of any advantage to feed it. Soft food\r\nis their natural diet, together with grasses, vegetables, and animal\r\nfood. The proper selection of the food is extremely important to secure\r\nthe rapid growth of the duck, and the ingredients of the food must\r\nbe such as will afford a well-balanced and substantial ration. As a\r\nwhole, it may be said that the rations used by the largest duck raisers\r\nare essentially the same, differing only in the quantities used in\r\nthe mixing. Investigations show the real values of the food to be the\r\nsame for producing rapid growth and early development. The duckling\r\ngrows twice as rapidly and is a much heavier eater than the chick, and\r\nto produce the best results its food must be such as will be easily\r\nassimilated. The various methods of feeding given in this bulletin are\r\nrecommended for raising ducks successfully.\r\n\r\nIt costs from 6 to 12 cents a pound to raise a duck for market at ten\r\nweeks of age. The cost of feed is from 4½ to 5 cents a pound, and\r\nthat of labor, etc., is from 4 to 8 cents a pound. It costs from $1.75\r\nto $2.50 each to keep breeding ducks a year.\r\n\r\nThe three different methods of feeding ducks are as follows: (1)\r\nFeeding ducks for market (ten weeks old); (2) feeding young ducks to\r\nbe kept as breeders; (3) feeding old ducks. The first method, for the\r\nsake of convenience and to explain more fully the composition of the\r\nrations, is subdivided into four parts, as follows.\r\n\r\n(1) From time of hatching to five days old provide the following\r\nmixture: Cracker or bread crumbs and corn meal, equal parts by measure;\r\nhard boiled eggs, 15 per cent of the total bulk of crackers and meal;\r\nsand, 5 per cent of the total of crackers and meal. Mix with water or\r\nmilk, and feed four times a day.\r\n\r\n(2) From five to twenty days old, the following mixture: Wheat bran,\r\ntwo parts by measure; corn meal, one part; rolled oats, 50 per cent of\r\nthis bulk; beef scraps, 5 per cent; sand, 5 per cent; green food, 10\r\nper cent. Mix with water to a dry crumbly state and feed four times a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n(3) From twenty to forty-two days old, the following mixture: Wheat\r\nbran, two parts by measure; corn meal, one part; beef scraps, 5 per\r\ncent of this bulk; sand, 5 per cent; green food, 10 per cent. Mix with\r\nwater to a dry crumbly state and feed four times a day.\r\n\r\n(4) From forty-two to seventy days old, the following mixture: Corn\r\nmeal, two parts by measure; wheat bran, one part; beef scraps, 10 per\r\ncent of this bulk; coarse sand or grit, 5 per cent; green food, 10 per\r\ncent. Mix with water to a dry crumbly state and feed four times a day.\r\n\r\nThe hours for feeding are 6 a. m., 10 a. m., 2 p. m., and 6 p. m.\r\n\r\nBelow is given another system of feeding ducks for marketing at ten\r\nweeks of age. This system is practically the same as the one given\r\nabove, differing only in the ingredients used for the first two parts\r\nor until the duckling is twenty days old. The method given below is\r\nused successfully by one of the largest duck raisers on Long Island. It\r\nis divided into three parts, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) From time of hatching to seven days old, feed equal parts by\r\nmeasure, corn meal, wheat bran, and No. 2 grade flour, and 10 per cent\r\nof this bulk coarse sand. Mix with water to a dry crumbly state and\r\nfeed four times a day.\r\n\r\n(2) From seven to fifty-six days old, feed equal parts by measure, corn\r\nmeal, wheat bran, and No. 2 grade flour; 10 per cent of this bulk beef\r\nscraps; 10 per cent coarse sand, and 12½ per cent green foods (green\r\nrye, oats, clover, etc.). Mix with water to a dry crumbly state and\r\nfeed four times a day.\r\n\r\n(3) From fifty-six to seventy days old, feed two parts by measure. Corn\r\nmeal; one part wheat bran; one part No. 2 grade flour; 12½ per cent\r\nof this bulk beef scraps; 10 per cent coarse sand; 12½ percent green\r\nfood. Mix with water to a dry crumbly state and feed three times a\r\nday--morning, noon, and night. Give last feed an hour before sundown.\r\n\r\nWhen ducks are raised for breeders they are fed differently from those\r\nintended for market. They are not forced so much as are the latter,\r\nand less fattening food is given them. The corn meal and beef scraps\r\nare reduced to one-half the quantity used in the above rations. The\r\nfollowing is an excellent ration: Equal parts corn meal, wheat bran,\r\ngreen food, 5 per cent beef scraps, and 5 per cent coarse sand or grit.\r\n\r\nA ration for breeding (laying) ducks is recommended as follows: Fifty\r\nper cent, by measure, corn meal; 15 per cent wheat bran; 15 per cent\r\ngreen foods (cooked vegetables, such as potatoes, turnips, etc.); 12\r\nper cent beef scraps, and 8 per cent coarse sand or grit. Mix with\r\nwater to a dry crumbly state and feed twice a day, morning and night.\r\nAfter the breeding season is over and the ducks have stopped laying\r\nthey are changed from this to the equal-parts ration, as given above\r\nfor ducklings from seven to fifty-six days old.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING FEED.\r\n\r\nThe feeding stuffs should be mixed in a trough sufficiently large to\r\nhold the quantity without wasting over the edges. First mix the corn\r\nmeal and bran together while dry; after these have mixed thoroughly,\r\nmaking an evenly colored mixture, it should be moistened with water\r\nand mixed to a dry, crumbly state. It should not be too wet or sloppy,\r\nas it is then not so good for the fowls, neither can it be handled and\r\nfed properly. Warm water should be used when the weather is excessively\r\ncold. In a second trough place the green foods, such as cut rye, oats,\r\netc., and dampen with water; then mix the allowance of the No. 2 grade\r\nflour with it. Thoroughly mix, so that the flour will completely cover\r\nthe green stuff. After this has been done mix the flour and green\r\nmixture with the corn meal and bran mixture and add the allowance of\r\nbeef scraps and sand. When vegetables are used, they should be well\r\ncooked before mixing in the rations.\r\n\r\nThe duck raisers on Long Island use large quantities of fish for their\r\nbreeding stock. This is known as the \"fish diet,\" and is considered\r\nas being very valuable to induce egg production. Where fish are cheap\r\nthey form an excellent substitute for beef scraps in the rations\r\nfor breeding ducks or ducks not intended for market, but under no\r\ncircumstances should fish be fed to stock that will be marketed. Fish\r\nmakes the flavor of the flesh strong and ducks fed on fish will not\r\nhave ready sales in the market. The fish are cooked by boiling in iron\r\ncamp kettles until well done, and then mixed, bones and all, in the\r\nrations as given above for breeding ducks. When fish is used the beef\r\nscraps are omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH TO FEED.\r\n\r\nThe amount of feed needed each day for young ducks varies as much as\r\ndoes their growth. Their growth averages a half pound a week, and to\r\nmake this increase of weight each week requires an additional quantity\r\nof food over the preceding one. The rule is, feed each meal what they\r\nwill eat up clean with a relish, and do not allow them to linger over\r\nthe feed trough. It is better they should have not enough than too\r\nmuch, as they will be in a much better condition to relish the next\r\nmeal. One thing is considered to be of as much importance as the feed,\r\nand that is removing the feed left over and thoroughly cleaning the\r\ntroughs after each meal. This is scrupulously attended to by successful\r\nduck raisers.\r\n\r\nOne raiser gives, as a generous allowance for one day's ration for one\r\nhundred laying ducks, the following: For the morning meal, 35 quarts\r\nof the mash, and for the evening meal 40 quarts, making a total of 75\r\nquarts for the day's portion, or three-fourths of a quart to each duck\r\na day. Another raiser allows 400 quarts, fed in halves, twice a day, to\r\nsix hundred breeding or laying ducks, averaging two-thirds of a quart\r\nto each duck a day.\r\n\r\nThere are many patterns of feed troughs in use, hardly any two being\r\nalike. They are simple affairs, the simpler the better, as they are\r\nmore easily kept clean. The designs given for water troughs are equally\r\nas good for feed troughs and answer the purpose very well. Each pen of\r\nbirds should have two troughs, one for water and the other for feed,\r\nbuilt proportionately to suit the age and size of the birds they are\r\nintended for. Make them of sufficient length to avoid crowding, so that\r\nall the birds in each pen will have ample room to eat at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER SHELLS AND GRIT.\r\n\r\nGrit in some form is essential to ducks and should be kept before them\r\nat all times. Many overlook this fact and do not seem to understand\r\nthat it is of as much value to them as it is to chickens. The sand used\r\nin the mashes tends to supply a certain amount of grinding material or\r\ngrit to them, but does not fully satisfy them for digesting their food.\r\nOn a farm where more than ten thousand birds are raised annually, and\r\nwhere disease is practically unknown, it was noted that in every pen\r\nthere was a box of grit and a box of crushed oyster shells. This raiser\r\nstates that he considers grit and oyster shells an absolute necessity\r\nfor ducks, and he attributes the healthy appearance of his stock to it.\r\nHis birds eat it freely and the supply is never allowed to run out.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING AND DRESSING FOR MARKET.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of dressing ducks for market, by dry picking and\r\nby scalding. Both of these methods are good and are being successfully\r\nemployed by the largest raisers. Some have a preference for dry picking\r\nand others for scalding, and it becomes only a matter of taste which\r\nmethod is used. When birds are dressed by scalding they should be\r\ndipped several times, or until the feathers come out easily. The back\r\nshould be dipped in the water first. After scalding, wipe them as dry\r\nas possible with a sponge and pick the breast feathers first. A bird\r\nwhen dressed for market has left on it the feathers on the wing, the\r\ntail feathers, and the feathers on head and neck, as shown in fig. 27.\r\nThe legs are left on, and the birds are not drawn.\r\n\r\nThe process of dry picking is considered the simpler of the two\r\nmethods, and one who is accustomed to the work can readily dress 3\r\ndozen birds in a day. The picker's outfit consists of a chair, a box\r\nfor the feathers, and a couple of knives, one knife being dull and the\r\nother being sharp pointed and double edged, for bleeding. The bird\r\nis taken between the knees, the bill held open with the left hand,\r\nand a cut made across the roof of the mouth just below the eyes. The\r\nbird is then stunned by striking its head against a post or some hard\r\nsubstance. The picker seats himself in the chair with the bird in his\r\nlap (fig. 28), its head held firmly between one knee and the box. The\r\nfeathers arc carefully sorted while picking; the pins are thrown away\r\nand the body feathers with the down are thrown into the box. Care\r\nshould be taken about this, as the feathers from each bird will weigh\r\nabout 2 ounces, and will quite pay for the picking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Pair dressed ducks (10 weeks old).]\r\n\r\nThe dull knife and the thumb are used to remove the long pinfeathers,\r\nand this should be done without tearing the skin. The down can usually\r\nbe rubbed off by slightly moistening the hand and holding the skin\r\ntight. Often some of the pins can not be taken out without tearing and\r\ndisfiguring the skin; when such is the case they should be shaved off.\r\nSeven or eight minutes is all the time necessary to dress a bird. After\r\nthe birds are picked they should be carefully washed, and plumped by\r\nplacing in a tank or barrel of ice water. They are hardened in this ice\r\nwater and given a rounded and full appearance. They are then packed\r\nin barrels or boxes and shipped to market. The first or bottom layer\r\nis packed with backs down; a layer of ice is then placed over them,\r\nand all other layers are packed with the breasts down, a layer of ice\r\nbeing between each layer of ducks. The top of the box or barrel is then\r\nrounded off with ice and covered with burlaps. A flour barrel will hold\r\nabout three dozen birds. Some raisers use boxes for shipping and have\r\nthe empties returned free.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE DUCKLING IN THE EGG.\r\n\r\nEggs to hatch must have good, strong germs and must be laid by healthy\r\nstock. Debilitated, degenerated stock will not produce healthy and\r\nvigorous young. The health of the breeding stock must be promoted and\r\neverything done that will assist to increase the fertility of the egg.\r\nComfortable houses, cleanliness, pure water, and above all wholesome\r\nand nutritious food, are the best promoters of health. The best stock\r\nto be had is none too good, and it is erroneous to send the earliest\r\nand best stock to market for the small increase in price, and save the\r\nlater and inferior stock for breeding purposes. A continuation of this\r\npractice for a few years means degenerate stock, infertile eggs, weak\r\ngerms, and large mortality among the newly-hatched birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Duck picker.]\r\n\r\nAfter an egg has been under incubation for thirty six hours, it will,\r\nif fertile, when held to the light, show a small dark spot a trifle\r\nlarger than a pin's head. This little spot is the life germ and shows\r\nthe egg to be fertile. From this time the development of the germ into\r\nthe duckling can be plainly seen if the egg be held to a strong light.\r\nOn the sixth or seventh day the first testing of the eggs should be\r\nmade and all infertile ones taken out. The germ is very distinct at\r\nthis time, and there has been a gradual change going on in the interior\r\nof the egg. The little spot has been constantly enlarging and becoming\r\nmore dense, and little veins are seen running in divers directions.\r\n\r\nThis is the appearance of an egg with a strong, live germ, which under\r\nfavorable circumstances will produce a duck.\r\n\r\nAn egg that is not fertile on the sixth or seventh day will be\r\nperfectly clear and transparent; all such should be removed at\r\nonce, as it is useless to allow them to remain. Another kind of egg\r\noften seen is a weak or imperfectly fertilized egg, and shows an\r\nirregularly-shaped blood vessel, which had started but lacked vitality\r\nenough to continue. Such an egg will not hatch and should also be\r\nremoved from the nest or incubator. Frequently the germ in an egg\r\nwill show life when tested on the seventh day, but lacks the vitality\r\nto carry it through, and when tested later will show dark, irregular\r\nblotches over the surface of the egg. These will not hatch, and should\r\nbe taken out when noticed.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth day the little creature inside the egg begins to\r\nassume shape and show considerable life. It has increased many times in\r\nsize since it was seen on the seventh day; the red veins have become\r\nmore numerous and have spread over the entire surface, while the yolk\r\nis scarcely distinguishable from the other portions. The pupil of\r\nthe eye has now become distinct, and the projection of the wings is\r\nclearly perceived. The absorption of the yolk has also commenced, and\r\nthis will continue until the twenty-fourth day, when it will be nearly\r\ncompleted. The egg from this time on will rapidly grow opaque, and at\r\nthe eighteenth or twentieth day is entirely so. On the twenty-fourth\r\nday the duckling is ready to make its way out of the shell, and in\r\nforty-eight hours after pipping the shell it will be entirely out.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL INCUBATION.\r\n\r\nHatching under the sitting hen (generally used for hatching ducks) is\r\nwhat is termed the natural process of incubation. The hatching of eggs\r\nby this means has always been followed, and no special skill is needed\r\nfor success, provided the eggs are well fertilized with healthy germs.\r\nMany who raise ducks in large numbers, however, use almost exclusively\r\nartificial means; some use both the natural and the artificial, while\r\nothers use the natural entirely.\r\n\r\nOf the natural method we shall treat first: Hens of medium size of the\r\nAmerican class, barred Plymouth Rocks and Wyandottes, are considered\r\nthe best for sitting. Nine duck eggs are about the right number to\r\nplace under a hen in early spring weather, but when the season is far\r\nadvanced as many as thirteen are used. The hens should be provided with\r\nlarge, roomy nests, and slatted fronts that can be removed and replaced\r\neasily when the hens are fed and watered. The nesting material should\r\nbe of hay or straw, and the nest should be slightly concaved; in the\r\nbottom place a little finely cut hay.\r\n\r\nBefore the hen is put on the eggs she should be thoroughly dusted\r\nwith insecticides; the nest also should have a good dusting of the\r\nsame. Both hen and nest should undergo a thorough dusting several\r\ntimes during the process of hatching as a safeguard against lice. When\r\nthe ducklings are hatched they should also have their share of the\r\ninsecticides before they are given to the hen. When a large number of\r\nsitting hens are used for hatching, as many as possible should be set\r\nat one time, and the ducklings raised in brooders. Hatching with hens\r\nmay be done on a large scale and the young brooded artificially. As\r\nmany as five hundred sitting hens are used on some farms for hatching\r\nducks. They are set in small houses or rooms with the nests around the\r\nsides in tiers, each nest having its own lattice door. Each day, in the\r\nmorning, the hens are taken from their nests and fed and watered on the\r\nfloor of the room. They are taken down in limited numbers, sections,\r\nas it were, at a time, and after they have had the food, drink, and a\r\nlittle exercise they are placed back on the nests and another section\r\nis fed and watered.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INCUBATION.\r\n\r\nThe subject of artificial incubation has engaged the attention of the\r\ncivilized world for generations past; the method has done wonders for\r\nthe poultry industry and has opened up the pathways to fortunes that\r\nmight otherwise never have been made. The science of incubation and\r\nbrooding has been developed wonderfully in this country during the last\r\nquarter of a century, and what seemed almost an impossibility then has\r\nindeed become a certainty now. There are many thousands of chicks and\r\nducklings hatched by artificial means each year, and the numbers of\r\ngood machines now being manufactured in this country at low prices make\r\npoultry raising a business that almost anyone with a limited capital\r\nmay profitably engage in. The mission of an incubator is to supplant\r\nthe sitting hen, and make it possible to hatch a large number of chicks\r\nat a minimum amount of cost and labor. That this can be done is proved\r\neach day.\r\n\r\nFor artificial incubation, have a room with a temperature as nearly\r\nuniform as possible. Balance the beat in the machines, or in other\r\nwords, see that the heat is uniform at both ends, and, in fact, all\r\nover them. See that each is running steadily before placing the eggs in\r\nit, as there is a great deal in starting right. The machines should be\r\nrun at a temperature of 102° for the first three weeks, and 103° the\r\nlast week. The eggs should be turned twice each day at regular periods.\r\nIntroduce a pan of water from the fifteenth to the twenty-second day,\r\nno matter what the location of the machine, whether in a damp cellar\r\nor in a dry room overhead, in a moist atmosphere near the seashore or\r\nin a dry one at an altitude in the country. The temperature may go as\r\nhigh as 101° just previous to and while hatching without injury. Place\r\nthe glass on a live egg after the animal heat rises, which will be\r\nwhen the circulation begins. This will be perceptible in good eggs the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth days.\r\n\r\nConsiderable weight has been put upon the ventilation question in\r\nincubators by manufacturers and operators, but it has been found that\r\nwhen the egg chamber is roomy, and the eggs are taken out and cooled\r\ntwice each day, it is not of so much consequence. There is no doubt\r\nbut that there must be some ventilation in the egg chamber, but from\r\nthe experience and observation of the writer the value of the subject\r\nhas been overestimated by many. Some machines have top ventilation,\r\nsome bottom, and others both top and bottom, and there is seemingly no\r\nmarked difference in the hatching.\r\n\r\nWhen the ducklings are hatching, the broken egg shells should be\r\nremoved once in every six or eight hours, so that they will not slip\r\nover the pipped eggs, as it would be sure death to the imprisoned ones.\r\nOccasionally a little bird is unable to free itself from the shell\r\nand needs help; the expert can readily detect when this is necessary.\r\nThe one point to note in this connection is this: The egg just before\r\nhatching radiates a great deal of heat, while the duckling, when first\r\nout, being not unlike a little sponge, absorbs it, or in other words,\r\nthe rapid evaporation which takes place generates cold; so that when\r\nthe ducklings are out the machine should be gauged one degree higher.\r\n\r\nWhen the ducklings are all out and dried off, the machine will run\r\nat least two degrees lower than when they were in the egg. Plenty\r\nof ventilation is needed in the machines while hatching. Keep the\r\nducklings in the machine at least twenty-four hours after hatching,\r\nwhen they will be strong enough to be removed to the brooder. The heat\r\nin the brooder should be started twenty-four hours previous to use, so\r\nthat it will be perfectly heated and ready for the ducklings when they\r\nare taken from the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD BREEDS OF GEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Introduction.=--There are seven standard breeds of geese, as follows:\r\nGray Toulouse, White Embden, Gray African, Brown Chinese, White\r\nChinese, Gray Wild, and Colored Egyptian.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY TOULOUSE GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Gray Toulouse geese (fig. 29) are named for the city in\r\nFrance of that name, where they are extensively bred. In this country\r\nthey are bred in large numbers by farmers and are fairly well thought\r\nof for market purposes. Their flesh is a trifle too coarse and flabby,\r\nwhen compared with some other geese, to be prized very highly for table\r\npurposes. They are termed a Christmas goose, as being later in maturing\r\nthan the others they are just about right at the holiday time. They are\r\nfairly good layers, averaging about 40 eggs in a season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Pair of Gray Toulouse geese.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--Toulouse geese are more compact in shape than other\r\ngeese, and are preferred by many for this reason. The head is rather\r\nlarge and short, and they have a comparatively short bill that is stout\r\nat the base; the neck is carried well up and is of medium length.\r\nThey have a broad back of moderate length, which curves slightly from\r\nthe neck to the tail; their breasts are broad and deep. The body of\r\nthe Toulouse goose is moderate in length, broad, and very deep and\r\ncompact, the more compact the better; and in birds in good condition\r\nthe belly almost touches the ground. Their wings are large, strong,\r\nand fold nicely against the sides, and they have comparatively short\r\ntails, and stout thighs and shanks. In color of plumage they are a dull\r\ngray, without penciling. The head is dark gray and the neck of the same\r\ncolor, which shades to a lighter gray as it approaches the back; the\r\nback is of dark gray, while the breast is light gray. The body plumage\r\nis light gray, which grows lighter and becomes white on the belly; the\r\nwhite extends back .to and around the tail, covering the fluffy parts.\r\nThe primaries of the wings are dark gray or brown; the secondaries are\r\na shade darker than the primaries and the coverts are dark gray. The\r\ntail feathers are gray and white, the ends tipped with white. Their\r\neyes are dark brown or hazel in color; their bills, shanks, toes, and\r\nwebs are of deep reddish-orange color.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 20 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 20 pounds; young gander, 18 pounds, and young goose, 15 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE EMBDEN GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--White Embden geese (fig. 30) are considered very practical\r\nbirds for farmers, and pay well for their keeping. They are nice\r\nlooking, of large size, tall and erect carriage,, and snow-white\r\nplumage. They originally came from Embden, in Westphalia, and have been\r\nbred in this country for many years.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--The Embdens are not so prolific as the Brown Chinese or\r\nToulouse, 20 eggs in a season being a good average for them. Their eggs\r\nare very large, white, and have a very thick, rough shell. In carriage\r\nthey are very tall and erect, and have fine square bodies. They have\r\nrather large heads, medium-sized bill, and a long neck that is carried\r\nupright. Their backs are of medium length, and arch slightly from the\r\nneck to the tail; the breast is round and full, and the body is large,\r\nsquare, and very deep, and, like the Toulouse, almost touches the\r\nground The wings are large and strong; tail short; thighs and shanks\r\nshort and stout. Their eyes are bright blue; bills flesh color; and\r\ntheir shanks, toes, and webs are deep orange.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 20 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 18 pounds; young gander, 18 pounds, and young goose 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY AFRICAN GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Gray African geese (fig. 31) are by many raisers considered\r\nthe most profitable of all geese to keep. They grow the heaviest in the\r\nshortest space of time, and are ready for market in ten weeks, weighing\r\nat that age between 8 and 10 pounds. They are very much like the Pekin\r\nduck in this respect, and as compared with other geese give the most\r\nsatisfactory returns for the least labor and time spent in growing\r\nthem. They are, according to standard weights, as heavy as the Toulouse\r\nand Embden, but specimens are not uncommon that exceed these weights\r\nby several pounds. They are first-class layers and average about 40\r\neggs in a season. This is considered as a low estimate for their egg\r\nproduction. For table purposes they are esteemed very highly, their\r\nflesh being fine and nicely flavored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Pair of White Embden geese.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--These geese have a large head, with a large knob,\r\nand a heavy dewlap under the throat. These and the Chinese geese are\r\ndifferent from the others in the head, and are the only two breeds that\r\nhave the knob on the head. The bill of the African is rather large and\r\nstout at the base, and their necks are long. Their backs are long and\r\nflat, breasts round and moderately full, and they have large, long, and\r\nupright bodies. The wings are large and strong, and are folded well\r\nagainst the body; the thighs are short and stout, and shanks of medium\r\nlength. The knob is black and the dewlap of a gray color, while the\r\nplumage of the neck is light gray with a dark stripe running from the\r\nhead to the body. The back is dark gray, the plumage of the breast is\r\ngray, and the underpart of body is light gray. The wings and tail are\r\ndark gray, and the thighs are light gray. The eyes are hazel or brown;\r\nbill, black; shanks, toes, and web are of dark-orange color.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 20 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 18 pounds; young gander, 10 pounds, and young goose, 14 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Pair of Gray African geese.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN AND WHITE CHINESE GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The smallest of the breeds of geese are the Chinese,\r\naveraging in weight from 6 to 7 pounds lighter than those previously\r\nnamed. Apparently their want of size has prevented them from becoming\r\nfavorites with those who raise large numbers annually, but with those\r\nwho keep a limited number they are found to be very practical. What\r\nthey lack in size they gain in egg production, being the most prolific\r\nof all breeds of geese, averaging from 50 to 60 eggs a year. In size,\r\naptitude to fatten, and ease of management they appear in no respect\r\ninferior to other geese, while the quality of flesh is decidedly\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--They are exceedingly graceful in appearance, quite\r\nhardy, and the young mature early. There are two varieties of Chinese\r\ngeese--the Brown (fig. 32) and the White. They have large heads, with\r\nlarge knob at base of a medium-length bill, and long, gracefully arched\r\nnecks. The backs are medium in length, and the breast is round and\r\nfull; body of medium size, round and plump; wings, large and strong;\r\nthighs, short and stout, and shanks of medium length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Pair of Brown Chinese geese (young).]\r\n\r\nThe color of head of the Brown Chinese geese is brown; knob dark brown\r\nor black; neck light brown or grayish brown, with a dark stripe from\r\nthe head down to the body. The body is dark brown, breast grayish\r\nbrown, and the under parts are a shade lighter in color. The wings and\r\ntail are brown, and the thighs are grayish brown. The eyes are hazel or\r\nbrown; bill dark brown or black; and shanks, toes, and webs are a dusky\r\norange color.\r\n\r\nThe color of plumage of the White Chinese geese is pure white\r\nthroughout, perfectly free from feathers of any other color. The knob\r\nand bill are orange color, as are also the shanks, toes, and web. The\r\neyes are a deep leaden blue.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 14 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 12 pounds; young gander, 10 pounds, and young goose, 8 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY WILD GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Gray Wild geese (fig. 33) are among the best known of\r\ndomestic geese, and are very generally bred throughout the entire\r\ncountry. They are among the most valuable and practical birds for goose\r\nraising, and are prized very highly for table purposes, besides being\r\ngood layers, hardy, and easy to rear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Gray wild goose.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=--These geese have a rather small head, small bill, sharp\r\nat the point, and long, slender neck, snaky in appearance. The back\r\nis long and rather narrow, and is arched from neck to tail; breast,\r\nfull and deep, and body long and somewhat slender. The wings are long,\r\nlarge, and powerful, and the thighs are rather short. The head of the\r\nWild goose is black, with a white stripe nearly covering the side of\r\nthe face; bill, black; neck, black; and back, dark gray.\r\n\r\nThe breast is light gray, which grows darker as it approaches the legs;\r\nthe plumage of the underparts of the body from the legs to the tail is\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe wings are dark gray; primaries dusky black, showing only a\r\ndark-gray color when the wing is folded; secondaries are brown, but of\r\na lighter shade than the primaries. The tail feathers are glossy black,\r\nand the thighs are gray. The shanks, toes, and webs are black. The eyes\r\nare black.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 16 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 14 pounds; young gander, 12 pounds, and young goose, 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORED EGYPTIAN GEESE.\r\n\r\n=History.=--The most beautiful of the breeds of geese are the colored\r\nEgyptians (fig. 34); they are purely ornamental, not having been\r\nbred in this country for any other purpose than the showroom. They\r\nare sometimes called the Nile Goose. This goose is tall and somewhat\r\nslender, which gives it an elegance of appearance not possessed by any\r\nother breed. It can generally be bred in confinement, but is of a most\r\nquarrelsome nature, and the male will fight to the death other males\r\nof the same species. The males must each be given a separate pen, and\r\nmated with the females; it is seldom that any two males can be kept in\r\nthe same pen.\r\n\r\n=Description.=--These geese have a medium-sized and rather long head, a\r\nbill of medium length, and a rather small neck. The back is narrow and\r\nslightly arched from the neck to the tail; breast, round; body, long,\r\nbut somewhat small and slender. Their wings are large, and have instead\r\nof the ordinary hard knobs horny spurs about five-eighths of an inch\r\nlong; the thighs are of medium length, and the shanks rather long. The\r\ncolor of the head is black and gray; the bill is purple or bluish red,\r\nand the eyes orange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Pair of Colored Egyptian geese.]\r\n\r\nThe neck and back are gray and black; the center of the breast is\r\nchestnut, and the balance is gray. The upper parts of the plumage of\r\nthe body are gray and black, and the under parts are a pale yellow,\r\npenciled with black. The shoulders of the wings are white, with a\r\nnarrow black stripe or bar. The tail feathers are glossy black; thighs,\r\npale buff; shanks, toes, and webs, reddish yellow. The eyes are orange.\r\n\r\n=Weight.=--The standard weight of the adult gander is 15 pounds; adult\r\ngoose, 12 pounds; young gander, 12 pounds, and young goose, 9 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF GEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoose raising is not so extensively engaged in as duck raising, the\r\nconditions under which they can be successfully raised being almost\r\nentirely different from those necessary for successful duck raising.\r\nThe duck, being smaller, can be raised in a more limited space than can\r\nthe goose, the latter needing free range and water, while the former\r\nhas been proved to do equally as well without water.\r\n\r\nWhile the goose can not profitably be raised in as large numbers as\r\nthe duck, still it can not justly be termed unprofitable. There are\r\nmany places on a farm that are worthless for cultivation that could\r\nbe utilized with excellent results for goose raising. Fields that\r\nhave streams, branches, or unused springs on them could be turned to\r\ngood advantage by making them into goose pastures. Many farmers are\r\nprofiting by this and adding to their incomes annually. The care and\r\nattention necessary for raising geese are very small when compared\r\nwith the returns, and the cost of food is also proportionately small\r\nin comparison with the cost of food used for other birds bred for\r\nmarket. A goose on range will gather the largest portion of its food,\r\nconsisting of grasses, insects, and other animal and vegetable matter\r\nto be found in the fields and brooks.\r\n\r\nThe simplest kinds of houses are used for shelter; these should\r\nbe built after the plans of those given for ducks, but should be\r\nproportionately of larger size to accommodate comfortably the number\r\nof birds to be kept. Geese are long-lived birds, some having been\r\nknown to attain the age of 40 years, while birds of 15 and 20 years of\r\nage are not uncommon. They retain their laying and hatching qualities\r\nthrough life. Ganders should not be kept for breeding after 3 years of\r\nage; young ganders are more active and insure greater fertility of the\r\neggs than old ones do; besides, ganders become more quarrelsome as age\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of geese are an important source of revenue and find\r\na ready sale in the markets. A goose will average about 1 pound of\r\nfeathers a year. The feathers should be plucked when there is no blood\r\nin the ends of the quills; this can be readily ascertained, as they\r\nwill then leave the flesh without hard pulling. Almost all breeds of\r\ngeese are good sitters and attentive mothers, and if left to themselves\r\nwill make their nests, much as when wild, and hatch a large percentage\r\nof their eggs. But hens are now more frequently used for hatching goose\r\neggs; as by taking the eggs from the goose when laid and giving them to\r\nhens to hatch, the goose will lay a greater number of eggs than if she\r\nwere permitted to sit.\r\n\r\nAll breeds of geese, except perhaps the Egyptian, are to be recommended\r\nto farmers who keep a limited number in addition to other poultry and\r\nallow them the freedom of the farm, but when goose raising is to be\r\nmore extensively engaged in, the African goose is to be especially\r\ncommended. It is the quickest to mature, most prolific, and the easiest\r\nto handle of any of the varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATING AND SETTING.\r\n\r\nIn breeding African geese, mate two geese to one gander, and it will\r\nbe still better if pairs are used to secure better fertility of the\r\neggs. Those who contemplate raising geese should secure their stock in\r\nthe fall, so that the birds may become accustomed to the place before\r\nthe breeding season begins. The breeding stock should be at least 2\r\nyears old, and fully matured birds. When stock is purchased in the\r\nfall they should be turned out in a pasture, and no other food than\r\nwhat they gather themselves will be needed until the grass goes down.\r\nTheir rations should then consist of equal parts by measure, bran,\r\nmiddlings, and corn meal, with 5 per cent of this bulk of beef scraps.\r\nThey should be given a light feed of this ration in the morning, and\r\nat night they should be fed cracked corn. Ten per cent of the bulk of\r\nthe daily ration should be green foods, steamed clover, and cooked\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Wild and African cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Embden and Toulouse cross.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breeding season begins about February 1, though some geese will\r\nbegin laying as early as December, then stop, and begin again the first\r\nof February. They make their own nests from the straw and litter on the\r\nfloor of their houses, and will lay from 12 to 20 eggs before becoming\r\nbroody. As soon as the goose shows an inclination to sit, remove her\r\nand place her in a dark box or small coop, and keep her there for two\r\nor three days with water for drink, but no food. Then she may be placed\r\nback in the yards and she will begin another laying of eggs. The first\r\nand second layings of eggs should be set under hens. After the goose\r\nlays the second laying she should be confined again, when she will\r\nlay a third laying. When she has laid the third laying she should be\r\npermitted to sit on them, instead of giving them to hens. A goose will\r\nlay from 10 to 15 eggs in each of the second and third layings.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that after the eggs have been sat upon for\r\ntwenty-five days, that they be taken from the nest and placed for about\r\none minute in water heated to a temperature of 104°. Thirty days are\r\nrequired for incubation. After the eggs have hatched leave the hen and\r\ngoslings in the nest for twenty-four hours; after the young have become\r\nthoroughly dry remove hen and brood and pen them in a large, roomy coop\r\nfor four or five days. When the goslings have reached this age--four or\r\nfive days--they are perfectly able to take care of themselves. The hen\r\nshould then be taken from the goslings, which should be allowed freedom\r\nto roam at will, but they should always be cooped up at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING AND DRESSING FOR MARKET.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Embden and African cross.]\r\n\r\nThe first feed for goslings is grass, fed on sod; a small allowance of\r\ncorn meal, slightly moistened, is also given them. Sand and charcoal\r\nare sometimes mixed with the corn meal. They are fed on the above food\r\nthree times a day for a couple of days, when they are given a ration\r\ncomposed of equal parts by measure, bran, middlings, and steamed cut\r\nclover or cooked vegetables. This feed is given them morning, noon, and\r\nnight, until they are 8 weeks old, when they are penned to be fattened\r\nfor market at 10 weeks old.\r\n\r\nTo fatten young geese, place them in a pen, not too large, so that they\r\nwill not exercise too much, and feed three times a day all they will\r\neat up clean of the following: Corn meal mixed to a dry crumbly state,\r\nand beef scraps amounting to 20 per cent of the bulk of the corn meal.\r\nWhile fattening young geese they should be kept as quiet as possible;\r\nno excitement whatever should disturb them. When feeding approach them\r\nquietly, and do not irritate them in the least or they will not fatten,\r\nbut will \"throw out\" or grow another crop of feathers. At 10 weeks of\r\nage, or when the tips of the wings reach the tail, they are ready for\r\nmarket and should weigh between 8 and 10 pounds.\r\n\r\nWhen young goslings are to be dressed for market they are killed by\r\ncutting them in the roof of the mouth, severing the artery, or by\r\nstunning them by hitting them a sharp, quick blow on the head. The\r\npicker uses a box in front of him about the height of the knees,\r\nholding the bird with the left hand and clasping the feet and wings\r\ntogether; he places the head of the bird against the box and holds it\r\nin place with the knee. Pick the feathers from the body of the bird,\r\nthen dampen the right hand and brush the body to remove the down. Leave\r\nabout 2 inches of feathers on the neck, and also leave feathers on the\r\nwings at the first joint. Lay the wings against the body of the birds\r\nand tie a string around to hold in position. I lace the birds, when\r\npicked, in cold water for an hour or so to plump them; if they are in\r\nthe water too long they are liable to bleach and become water-soaked.\r\nThey are then iced up in barrels already to ship to market.\r\n\r\nYoung geese should be marketed in October. It is best to market all\r\npossible before cold weather sets in. It is much harder to dress a\r\ngosling in cold weather. The feathers set tighter, and in picking them\r\nthe flesh is torn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS BREEDING.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory results are to be had by breeding pure\r\nstandard-bred stock without crossing. But to those who are partial to\r\ncrosses the following are considered the best to make: (1) Wild gander\r\non African goose (fig. 35); (2) Embden gander on Toulouse goose (fig.\r\n36); (3) Embden gander on African goose (fig. 37), and (4) Embden\r\ngander on White China goose. These crosses will give good growth and\r\nthe young birds will dress well for market. Crosses should only be made\r\nfor market purposes, and should always be bred from original stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' BULLETINS.\r\n\r\nThese bulletins are sent free of charge to any address upon application\r\nto the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.
