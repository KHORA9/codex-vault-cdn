If the\r\nsoil is heavy, a better practice is to sow after a crop of small grain or\r\non other land which can be specially prepared.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover will grow on poorer soil than most clovers and is not\r\nparticularly dependent upon lime. For this reason it has been widely used\r\nfor restoring the productivity of soils which have been abused. A more\r\nimportant function is to maintain crop yields on soils which are already\r\nmoderately rich.\r\n\r\nThe most common difficulty in growing crimson clover is the killing of the\r\nyoung stands by drought. This is best prevented by the preparation of a\r\nfine, moist, and firmly compacted seed bed.\r\n\r\nAugust and September are the best months for sowing crimson clover, the\r\nexact date depending upon the condition of the soil. Either hulled or\r\nunhulled seed may be used, the latter giving somewhat greater certainty of\r\na stand.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is often sown with a nurse crop of buckwheat or cowpeas, to\r\nprotect it from the sun. A light covering of straw is also effective.\r\n\r\nCombinations of crimson clover with oats, hairy vetch, or other fall-sown\r\nforage crops give somewhat higher yields and a surer stand than crimson\r\nclover alone.\r\n\r\nNo insects trouble crimson clover seriously, and the only severe disease\r\nis the stem-rot, or wilt.\r\n\r\n              Contribution from the Bureau of Plant Industry\r\n                           WM.

The individual\r\nflowers of this clover are commonly of a rich scarlet color, and as the\r\nheads are borne mostly on the ends of the stems, a field of crimson clover\r\nin full bloom presents a strikingly brilliant appearance. Because of the\r\ncolor of the flowers, crimson clover is often termed \"scarlet clover,\"\r\nalthough it is also known, less commonly, as \"French clover,\" \"Italian\r\nclover,\" \"German clover,\" \"incarnate clover,\" and \"annual clover.\" It is\r\nthe only annual true clover that is of more than incidental agricultural\r\nimportance in the eastern United States.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important characteristic of crimson clover is its\r\nability to grow and make its crop during the fall and early spring,\r\nwhen the land is not occupied by the ordinary summer-grown crops. In\r\nsections where it succeeds, it can be sown following a grain crop or in\r\nan intertilled crop in late summer and is ready to harvest for hay, to\r\npasture, or to turn under as green manure in time to plow the land for\r\nspring-seeded crops, such as corn or cotton. South of central Delaware\r\nit may even be cut for seed and the stubble plowed under in time for\r\nseeding a quick-maturing strain of corn. Because it can be grown during\r\nthe offseason of the year, crimson clover is one of the most economical\r\nlegumes for green manuring, and it has been largely used for that purpose\r\nin the regions to which it is adapted. The many uses to which this crop\r\nmay be put merit a careful study of the best methods of establishing a\r\nstand of this clover on the farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A single plant of crimson clover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=HISTORY AND ADAPTATIONS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is a native of Europe, where it is cultivated as a forage\r\nand green-manuring crop in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Austria, and\r\nGreat Britain. Large quantities of crimson-clover seed are exported from\r\nEurope to the United States, especially from the districts of central\r\nFrance, where crimson clover is the premier leguminous forage plant.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover was introduced into this country as early as 1818, and the\r\nseed was widely distributed by the United States Patent Office in 1855.\r\nThe plant was at first regarded more for its ornamental value than as a\r\nforage plant, however, and it was not until about 1880 that its value for\r\nagricultural purposes began to be appreciated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Map of a part of the United States, showing the\r\nregion where crimson clover is most widely grown.]\r\n\r\nAt present crimson clover is grown most widely in the lighter sandy\r\nareas of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, where the soil is not very rich\r\nand the winters are not severe. (Fig. 2.) The plant does not withstand\r\neither extreme cold or extreme heat, and its culture is therefore limited\r\nto regions which enjoy at some time during the year a long period of\r\nrelatively mild, moist weather. Ordinarily, this clover does not survive\r\nthe winter in latitudes north of southern Pennsylvania, while in some of\r\nthe Southern States it is frequently killed by dry, hot weather in the\r\nfall or spring. It succeeds well in the humid regions near the Gulf of\r\nMexico and in the Pacific Northwest, but in these areas it is not widely\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nNormally, crimson clover is a winter annual comparable to winter wheat;\r\nthat is, it is planted in the fall, lies more or less dormant over winter,\r\ngrows rapidly in the spring, and dies, after going to seed, early in the\r\nsummer. Where the summers are not too hot it can be planted in the spring\r\nand grown as a summer crop, but for this purpose other clovers are usually\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=VARIETIES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is exceedingly variable both in color of flower and in\r\ntime of maturity. These variations are particularly noticeable in fields\r\nplanted from a mixed lot of seed, the flowers presenting a range in color\r\nfrom nearly pure white to a deep purplish red and the seeds a difference\r\nin date of ripening of more than a month. Since crimson clover is thought\r\nto be mainly self-pollinated, it is easy to fix these qualities by\r\nselection and to establish definite varieties.\r\n\r\nIn Europe six or seven different varieties of crimson clover are\r\nrecognized and sold by seedsmen, varying from extra early crimson flowered\r\nto, extra late white flowered and from very hardy to non-hardy. By the use\r\nof a succession of these varieties the European farmer is able to spread\r\nhis harvest over six or seven weeks instead of having it concentrated\r\nwithin a few days, as in America. Similarly, the culture of the plant has\r\nbeen extended northward from Italy to Sweden by means of hardy strains.\r\nA wild form of crimson clover having yellowish flowers and hairy foliage\r\noccurs in southern and eastern Europe and in England, but it is not of\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\nIn America no sharply defined varieties of crimson clover are recognized,\r\nexcept a white-blooming variety which is sold in the South and is two\r\nweeks later than the ordinary crimson-flowered sort. Hardy strains have\r\nbeen developed and used in a small way in Massachusetts and Ohio, but\r\nthese are not commercially available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=USE IN THE ROTATION.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING IN INTERTILLED CROPS.=\r\n\r\nIn former years a large percentage of the crimson-clover acreage was\r\nseeded in corn or other intertilled crops at or shortly after the time of\r\nthe last cultivation. In most of the crimson-clover area it is possible\r\nto make such a seeding, obtain a good growth during the fall and early\r\nspring, and mow or plow under the clover in time, for breaking up the land\r\nfor another crop of corn. This has been the standard method of growing\r\nthis clover, and it is still the leading practice in many of the older\r\nsections. Corn in the summer with crimson clover in the winter is a cheap\r\nand convenient method of growing a cash crop and a restorative crop the\r\nsame year, and the reputation of crimson clover as a crop increaser is\r\nlargely based on this simple rotation. Instances are by no means rare\r\nwhere the yield of corn has been gradually increased from 10 bushels per\r\nacre to as high as 70 bushels by this means.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this method is the possibility of the stand of young\r\nclover failing through drought. The growing corn makes a heavy demand on\r\nthe soil moisture, and if there is not enough moisture for both clover and\r\ncorn the latter gets the larger share and the tender clover plants are\r\nlikely to succumb. Because of the risk involved, farmers in the upland\r\nsections are seeking other and more reliable methods of seeding, and the\r\nsowing of crimson clover in corn is gradually decreasing.\r\n\r\nWhere the danger from fall drought is not serious, crimson clover may be\r\nsown in corn at the time of the last cultivation or when the corn leaves\r\nhave just begun to wither. South of central Virginia there is likely to be\r\nmuch hot weather after the corn is laid by, in which case it is best to\r\ndelay the seeding of the clover until after the first rain. The appearance\r\nof a field of crimson clover seeded in corn the previous summer is shown\r\nin figure 3.\r\n\r\nSouth of southern Virginia crimson clover can be seeded in cotton,\r\nprovided the field is free from crab-grass and other weeds and the soil is\r\nnot too dry. In the extreme north of the cotton belt the seed may be sown\r\nat the last working of the cotton; farther south this occurs too early and\r\nit is necessary to wait for a rain, which often comes at about the time of\r\nthe first picking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Crimson clover in an old cornfield. The clover\r\nwas seeded in the corn at the last cultivation. A fodder stack is to be\r\nobserved in the middle foreground. The cornstalks have been removed to\r\navoid difficulty in mowing the clover.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be seeded in practically any of the cultivated truck\r\ncrops which receive their last cultivation from 8 to 12 weeks before\r\nthe first frost. It is not practicable to seed the clover in late\r\npotatoes, sweet potatoes, or other root crops, as the digging in the fall\r\npractically destroys the clover.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, crimson clover does not succeed when sown in cowpeas, sorghum,\r\nor watermelons, owing to the heavy shade cast by these crops. It can,\r\nhowever, be seeded in tobacco, tomatoes, cultivated soy beans, and\r\ncantaloupes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING AFTER AN EARLY-MATURING CROP.=\r\n\r\nSeeding crimson clover in an intertilled crop is successful mostly on\r\nsandy soils, which can easily be prepared for seeding even in mid-summer.\r\nOn clay soils and in weedy fields this method of seeding is likely to be\r\nunsatisfactory. Such soils are usually hard and dry in August and can with\r\ndifficulty be brought into condition for a seed bed, with the result that\r\na large percentage of such seedings fail. A better plan on clay soils, and\r\non sandy soils in many cases, is to seed the crimson clover on specially\r\nprepared ground from which all other crops have been removed. Such ground\r\ncan be made as fine and firm as desired. Furthermore, the clover after\r\nplanting does not have to compete with another crop for the soil moisture.\r\nThis method is somewhat more troublesome than planting in intertilled\r\ncrops, but the greater certainty of getting a stand more than offsets the\r\ngreater cost. Planting crimson clover on specially prepared ground has\r\nextended the culture of the plant to regions where it was not hitherto\r\ngrown and is increasing the reliability of the crop in sections where it\r\nhas been long established.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary rotation, crimson clover follows a crop of small grain.\r\nHowever, it may follow any crop that is removed 8 to 10 weeks before\r\nfrost, or it may be seeded on fallow ground. Ground from which early\r\npotatoes have been removed is especially favorable for the establishment\r\nof a stand of this clover. The residual effect of the fertilizers used on\r\npotatoes is partially responsible for this, while the well-settled seed\r\nbed, which requires only leveling and harrowing, also presents favorable\r\nconditions for the crimson-clover seedlings.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the South crimson clover can be seeded in corn stubble if\r\nan early variety of corn has been used. Although there is some risk that\r\nthe clover may not make enough growth before winter if seeding is delayed\r\nuntil the corn is harvested, the danger of losing the stand is not as\r\ngreat as if the clover were seeded earlier, while the corn was standing.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is sometimes seeded after a grass or clover crop if the\r\nrainfall in July is sufficient to cause the sod to decay. In the far South\r\nit can be planted after peanuts, while in all sections it can be sown as\r\na catch crop on land where cotton or other crops have died early in the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A STAND.=\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the difficulty most commonly experienced in growing crimson\r\nclover is failure to obtain a satisfactory stand. Sometimes the seed does\r\nnot germinate well; more commonly good germination is secured, but the\r\nseedlings wither and die before they can become established. Frequently\r\nnot more than 50 per cent of the plants survive the first three weeks,\r\nwhile a complete failure of the crop is a common risk even in the sections\r\nwhere crimson clover is most widely grown.\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of failure to obtain a stand is hot, dry\r\nweather after planting. The seedlings of crimson clover are tender,\r\nsucculent, and shallow rooted and are easily killed by lack of moisture.\r\nUnfortunately, in most of the crimson-clover area the weather during late\r\nAugust and early September is very likely to be hot and droughty, making\r\nthe planting of the clover at that time rather hazardous. Some farmers\r\nattempt to avoid this difficulty by planting either in early summer or in\r\nOctober, after the fall rains; there is danger, however, that the plants\r\nwill make too much or too little growth to survive the winter. In the\r\nlong run it is probably better to plant at the regular time and depend\r\nupon thorough preparation of the seed bed to offset any deficiency in the\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SOILS.=\r\n\r\nCrimson clover can be grown successfully on almost any type of soil if it\r\nis reasonably rich, well drained, and supplied with organic matter and the\r\nproper inoculating bacteria. Probably two-thirds of the crimson-clover\r\nacreage is found on the sandy soils of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, but\r\nthe crop is not necessarily restricted to sandy soils and is in fact\r\nincreasing in importance on the red-clay soils of the Piedmont region and\r\nin the limestone valleys of Virginia and Tennessee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--a crimson-clover failure on ground too poor in\r\nhumus.]\r\n\r\nCrimson clover has been an important factor in increasing yields on soils\r\nthat have been abused, but it is not a crop for land which is naturally\r\nvery poor. It does not do well on rough, newly cleared areas, raw\r\nsubsoil, Hard, dry clay, or sterile sand. (Fig. 4.) For such soils soy\r\nbeans, cowpeas, and velvet beans are better suited and should be used for\r\nthe first three or four years until crimson clover can be successfully\r\ngrown. Crimson clover can be made to grow on poor soils, provided they\r\nare specially prepared by liming, manuring, and inoculating. In general,\r\nhowever, crimson clover is a crop for maintaining soils which are already\r\nfairly productive rather than one for inducing productivity in soils where\r\nit is quite lacking. If there is any doubt whether the soil is suitable\r\nfor crimson clover, a small plat should be prepared under field conditions\r\nand planted one year for trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.=\r\n\r\nTo secure a full, even stand of crimson clover with any degree of\r\nregularity the seed bed should be well and thoroughly prepared. The soil\r\nshould be firm, moist, well settled, and fine on top. Only indifferent\r\nsuccess can possibly be expected if the seed is scattered on land which\r\nis loose, dry, and full of hard lumps and trash. A loose seed bed dries\r\nout quickly, heaves during the winter, and on some soils blows and washes\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--A corrugated roller or pulverizer, an excellent\r\nimplement for preparing the seed bed for crimson clover.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the seed bed should not be too hard, for although this\r\nclover often grows successfully on soil which would be too solid for\r\ncorn, there must be at| least enough loose soil on the surface to cover\r\nthe seed. Thorough preparation is the very best insurance against failure\r\nof the stand through drought or winterkilling, and the most successful\r\ngrowers sow crimson clover on land as well prepared as that for wheat.\r\n\r\nTo secure a fine, firm seed bed without drying out the surface soil, the\r\nland should be prepared with as few operations as possible. A single\r\nworking when the soil is in a moist, crumbly condition is better than half\r\na dozen workings when the soil is too wet or too dry. In very sandy soils,\r\nor soils which do not form a crust, the only preparation needed is to keep\r\ndown the weeds.\r\n\r\nAn excellent tool for making the seed bed is the corrugated roller or\r\npulverizer (fig. 5). This implement is an improvement over the old plain\r\nroller for breaking clods and is unexcelled for keeping the surface soil\r\nmoist. It can be used after plowing and again before planting, and even\r\nafter planting if the soil needs to be compacted. Rolling of some kind to\r\nfirm the soil is especially important on sandy soils, but it is equally\r\nbeneficial on clay soils if they are cloddy.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is seeded in an intertilled crop, such as corn, cotton, or\r\ntomatoes, the customary cultivation received by these crops is ordinarily\r\nsufficient preparation for crimson clover. In sandy soil the clover is\r\noften seeded without any immediate preparation, but a light stirring with\r\na harrow-toothed cultivator is desirable if the ground is hard. If the\r\nclover is to be used for hay or seed, the preceding crop should be laid by\r\nlevel rather than in ridges. This will facilitate cutting the clover.\r\n\r\nWhere crimson clover is seeded after a crop of small grain, the stubble\r\nshould be plowed or disked as soon as possible after the grain is cut.\r\nStubble land dries out quickly, partly because the soil is suddenly left\r\nbare and partly because of the drain on the soil moisture by the crops of\r\nragweed and other coarse-growing weeds which always follow a grain crop.\r\nUnless the soil is cultivated at once it becomes very difficult to obtain\r\nanything like an ideal seed bed for crimson clover. This difficulty is\r\nusually more pronounced after oats and barley than after rye and wheat.\r\nOrdinarily the best practice is to disk the grain stubble within a week\r\nafter harvest and harrow every week, or at least after every rain, in\r\norder to settle the ground, destroy the weeds, and assist in holding the\r\nmoisture pending the time of seeding the clover. Plowing the stubble\r\nis more expensive than disking and requires that the ground be allowed\r\nto settle for a month or six weeks in order to secure a firm seed bed.\r\nPlowing is an advantage in a wet season, because plowed ground dries\r\nreadily; it is a disadvantage in a dry season for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FERTILIZERS.=\r\n\r\nOn moderately rich soil the fertilizer applied to the preceding crop is\r\nsufficient to produce a good crop of crimson clover. This is especially\r\ntrue where the clover follows such crops as potatoes or tomatoes, which\r\nordinarily are heavily treated with fertilizers. It is important to\r\nrealize, however, that crimson clover has a very short period of growth,\r\nand that to make a vigorous growth it must have a good supply of plant\r\nfood. On sandy soils where fertilizers have not recently been applied it\r\nis often the practice to apply from 150 to 200 pounds of acid phosphate,\r\nwith some potash fertilizer if it can be afforded. On clay soils 200 or\r\n300 pounds per acre of acid phosphate ordinarily are sufficient. On many\r\nsoils a light application of nitrate of soda will assist materially in\r\ngiving the young clover plants a good start and often will enable them to\r\nwithstand the effects of a late drought or severe winter which otherwise\r\nmight have injured the stand. If the seeding has been delayed, as by\r\nwaiting for suitable rains, an application of not more than 75 pounds of\r\nnitrate of soda per acre will stimulate the young plants and enable them\r\nto make a better growth before winter.\r\n\r\nFertilizer is usually applied at seeding time, but a few farmers have been\r\nfound who apply it as a top-dressing very early the following summer,\r\ngiving as a reason that there is then no loss from winter leaching and\r\nthat by this method the plants are nourished at the time they are making\r\ntheir most vigorous growth. Such top-dressings of fertilizer should not\r\nbe made while the leaves are wet with rain or dew. Where stable manure is\r\napplied to crimson clover very marked results follow. It may be spread\r\njust before seeding when the clover is not grown in an intertilled crop,\r\nor it may be applied as a top-dressing in winter or very early spring.\r\n\r\nThe more vigorous the growth that can be induced by the application of\r\nsuitable fertilizers the more marked will be the increase in the yield of\r\nthe succeeding crops. On soil in a low state of productivity the use of\r\na reasonable amount of fertilizer will often enable a successful crop of\r\nclover and succeeding crops to be produced, where had not the fertilizers\r\nbeen applied the clover would have failed. Furthermore, the following\r\ncrop, particularly if it be corn, would also fail to give the increased\r\nyield which follows a successful stand of crimson clover.\r\n\r\nAn application of barnyard manure will be found to be especially effective\r\nin obtaining a stand of crimson clover on any thin, galled spots in the\r\nfield. The manure should be worked into the ground before seeding, and,\r\nif possible, a second application as a top-dressing should be given a day\r\nor two after planting. The top-dressing stimulates the seedlings and if\r\nstrawy helps to protect them from the August sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n=LIME.=\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is not as dependent on lime as red clover and alfalfa,\r\nbeing more like alsike clover in this respect. It does not thrive on soils\r\nwhich are very \"sour,\" but on well-drained soils in a productive condition\r\ncrimson clover frequently makes a vigorous growth, even though the soil\r\nmay show a high lime requirement. The stands are usually more uniformly\r\ngood over the limed parts of such fields than on the unlimed parts,\r\nalthough it is sometimes questionable whether the benefit derived from\r\nliming is profitable. Liming is more often desirable on clay soils than\r\non sandy soils, and usually gives better results when used in conjunction\r\nwith fertilizers than when used alone. On light sandy soils deficient\r\nin humus burnt lime may be actually injurious. In considering the\r\nadvisability of applying lime one must not lose sight of the need of lime\r\non the part of such other crops as corn, cantaloupes, or peaches, which\r\nare either grown with or follow the clover. Inasmuch as the effect of\r\nliming varies greatly in different localities, it is suggested that small\r\nplats be treated experimentally at different rates before any considerable\r\nareas are limed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=INOCULATION.=\r\n\r\nA large part of the value of all clovers lies in their ability to utilize\r\nthe nitrogen of the air and add it to the soil. When grown on rich land,\r\nthe clovers, like many other plants, use the nitrogen already present in\r\nthe soil and are not stimulated to contribute any to their own support or\r\nto the support of other crops. To enable the clover to use the nitrogen in\r\nthe air the presence of the proper nodule-forming bacteria in the soil is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFortunately, most of the soils in the crimson-clover sections appear to\r\nbe already inoculated, and artificial inoculation is not often necessary,\r\nexcept on soils new to the crop. Crimson clover is inoculated by the same\r\nstrain of bacteria which occurs on the roots of the other true clovers;\r\nconsequently, a field which has produced a good stand of red, mammoth,\r\nalsike, white, hop, Carolina, rabbit's-foot, or buffalo clover is usually\r\ninoculated sufficiently for crimson clover. Sweet clover, Japan clover,\r\nand bur clover are not true clovers and are inoculated by a different\r\nstrain of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe importance of inoculation is well shown by an experiment conducted by\r\nthe Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. In this experiment yields of\r\n4,057 and 6,100 pounds of crimson-clover hay were secured on inoculated\r\nsoils, while on corresponding areas which were not inoculated the yields\r\nwere 761 pounds on one area and nothing on the other.\r\n\r\nThe soil can be inoculated artificially by means of pure cultures of the\r\nbacteria or by the transfer of a small quantity of soil from another\r\nclover field.[2] The latter method is the more certain, but is open to\r\nthe danger of introducing noxious weeds, insects, and plant diseases,\r\nespecially if the soil is brought from a distance. The presence of\r\nstem-rot in many sections makes the use of soil especially dangerous. This\r\ndisease can, be carried with the soil from field to field.\r\n\r\n[2] Sufficient pure culture for inoculating seed for 1 acre can be secured\r\nfree from the United States Department of Agriculture. Full directions for\r\nusing the culture accompany each bottle. Directions for inoculating by the\r\nsoil-transfer method can also be obtained from this Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=SEEDING.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=TIME OF SEEDING.=\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is usually sown between August 15 and October 1, the\r\ngeneral rule being to plant about 60 days before the first killing frost\r\nis expected. South of Virginia crimson clover can be seeded as late as\r\nNovember 1, although if planted late more seed should be used and a light\r\ndressing of nitrate of soda applied, in order to stimulate the young\r\nplants. Seeding earlier than August 1 is seldom advisable unless the crop\r\nis sown with some other crop the shade of which will hold it back.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of planting depends almost entirely upon the moisture\r\ncontent of the soil. The principal condition to avoid is planting when the\r\nsoil contains just enough moisture to germinate the seeds, but not enough\r\nto keep the plants growing. Usually it is better to plant when the soil is\r\nquite dry than when it is slightly moist, for in dry soil the seeds, if\r\nproperly buried, lie without germinating and are ready to grow vigorously\r\nat the first rainfall. The most favorable time for seeding is just before\r\nor just after a good rain, when the soil is moist enough to form a ball in\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n=RATE OF SEEDING.=\r\n\r\nThe ordinary rate of seeding crimson clover is 15 pounds per acre,\r\nalthough the rate varies according to conditions. From 12 to 15 pounds per\r\nacre are usually sufficient when growing the crop for seed or when the\r\nsoil is unusually rich. On poor soil, dry soil, or on soil which has not\r\npreviously produced crimson clover 18 to 22 pounds of seed give better\r\nassurance of a stand. Heavy seeding is also desirable when planting late\r\nin the season or when a heavy crop is wanted for green manure early in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, 2 pounds of seed per acre would provide six plants\r\nfor every square foot, which is a satisfactory stand. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, however, it is necessary to allow for some of the seed\r\nbeing too deep, or too shallow, or failing to germinate, and for a certain\r\npercentage of winterkilling. It is also well to have a fairly thick stand\r\nof the young plants, so that the ground may be well covered during the\r\nearly fall and thus prevent soil washing and the growth of winter weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=METHODS OF SEEDING.=\r\n\r\nThe most common method of seeding crimson clover in intertilled crops\r\nis to scatter the seed broadcast with a rotary seeder or by hand. (Fig.\r\n6.) In order to place the seed on a fresh, moist seed bed it is commonly\r\nbroadcasted immediately behind the cultivator at the last cultivation and\r\nis covered 'at once by a second cultivator. In tall corn the seed may be\r\nsown from horseback, the ears of the horse being covered with small bags\r\nto prevent the entrance of the flying seed. Slightly more seed is required\r\nwhen seeding in tall corn, as some seed catches in the corn plants. When\r\nseeding in cotton care must be taken to avoid injury to the opening bolls,\r\nwhich are easily knocked off or torn. This is best done by seeding by\r\nhand, covering the seed with a piece of brush dragged down the rows.\r\n\r\nIn low-growing truck crops and on fallow ground crimson clover can be\r\nseeded with a wheelbarrow seeder. This implement distributes the seed more\r\nevenly than can be done by hand or with the rotary seeder, especially\r\nwhen planting a mixture of crops. The wheelbarrow seeder being somewhat\r\nawkward to handle is better adapted to smooth, level fields than to\r\nhillsides.\r\n\r\nProbably the very best method of seeding crimson clover is with the\r\nspecial clover or alfalfa drill. Where enough clover is grown to warrant\r\nits use this implement is to be highly recommended. The seed is sown in\r\n4-inch rows at just the proper depth and with the right pressure, and the\r\nfertilizer is placed exactly under each row, where it will be immediately\r\navailable to the seedlings. Drilled clover requires less seed than\r\nbroadcasted clover and produces a more even and certain stand.\r\n\r\nIn place of the special clover drill an ordinary grain drill equipped with\r\na clover-seed attachment can be used with good results. Special spouts\r\nshould be arranged to lead from the clover-seed box back of the shoes or\r\ndisks, in order to deposit the seed directly in the furrow. Chain furrow\r\nclosers are best for covering the seed, as they leave the furrows broad\r\nand flat instead of =V= shaped and lessen the danger of the seedlings\r\nbeing covered with soil during a hard rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Seeding crimson clover in corn at the last\r\ncultivation.]\r\n\r\nFor use in intertilled crops there are several types of 1-row drills, the\r\nbest for this purpose being the 5-hoe drill equipped with press wheels.\r\n\r\nCrimson-clover seed must be covered, but not too deeply. In most soils it\r\nis not enough to depend on rain to effect a covering. An inch in sandy\r\nsoils and half an inch in clay soils appear to be about the right depth.\r\nShallow planting gives the best results in wet seasons and deep planting\r\nin time of drought. Broadcasted seed should be covered with a spike-tooth\r\nharrow or a weeder rather than a heavy harrow or a shovel cultivator. A\r\nharrow made of fairly stiff brush is often useful in loose soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHOICE OF SEED.=\r\n\r\nAs a rule, fresh crimson-clover seed is of good viability, and failure\r\nto secure a stand is not often caused by failure of the seed to grow.\r\nUnlike most clovers, crimson-clover seed absorbs water readily and sprouts\r\nquickly. There are practically none of the hard seeds which are so\r\nfrequent in red clover and sweet clover, and a germination of 90 per cent\r\nin 48 hour's is not uncommon. The seed deteriorates rapidly, however, and\r\nwhen more than 2 years old rarely shows a germination in excess of 50 per\r\ncent. Sometimes, when stocks of commercial seed are low, old seed finds\r\nits way to the market, and this, when planted, gives poor results. Old\r\nseed can usually be detected by the dull-brown appearance of the seed coat\r\nas contrasted with the bright, shiny, pinkish or greenish yellow color of\r\nfresh seed. Brown seed, however, is sometimes caused by weathering during\r\nharvest, and such seed is not objectionable unless the weathering has been\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nA common impurity in crimson-clover seed is green, shrunken, and immature\r\nseed, caused by harvesting the crop before it is ripe. Crimson-clover seed\r\ndoes not germinate readily until it takes on a yellowish tinge; therefore,\r\ngreen seed should be rejected.\r\n\r\nCrimson-clover seed is larger and plumper than red-clover seed and if\r\nproperly cleaned should not contain seeds of dodder or the smaller\r\nseeded weeds. Frequently, however, it does contain the seeds of field\r\npeppergrass, yellow trefoil, evening primrose, sheep sorrel, wild\r\ngeranium, buttercups, mustards, and other weeds which blossom in early\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=UNHULLED SEED.=\r\n\r\nThere is a growing belief among farmers that they are less likely to lose\r\na stand of crimson clover through drought if they sow the seed in the hull\r\nrather than use the hulled seed as it ordinarily appears on the market.\r\nIt is claimed that the hulls hold the moisture to some extent and carry\r\nthe seedlings over the critical day or two following germination, while\r\nsome farmers assert that the unhulled seeds require more moisture for\r\ngermination, and the seeds therefore do not sprout until there is enough\r\nmoisture in the soil to keep the plants growing. Unhulled seed is bulky\r\nand is not often handled by commercial seedsmen, although one large grower\r\nsells the unhulled seed in compressed, bales similar to small cotton\r\nbales. It usually can be secured from neighboring farmers, however, or is\r\neasily saved at home. The seed can be harvested with a stripper from the\r\nstanding crop in the field or the mature crop can be cut and thrashed like\r\nan ordinary grain crop. For local planting on a small scale unhulled seed\r\nis the cheapest and most accessible form of crimson-clover seed.\r\n\r\nUnhulled seed is somewhat difficult to sow, because the hairy hulls stick\r\ntogether in masses and can not be scattered uniformly. To avoid this\r\ntrouble the seed may be mixed with moistened earth or with lime, or may be\r\nsown with a blower similar to those used on small forges. A better plan\r\nis to sow on a windy day, throwing the seed vertically into the air and\r\nallowing the wind to scatter it.\r\n\r\nOf unhulled seed of the best quality, 100 pounds contains about 1 bushel\r\n(60 pounds) of clean seed. The common grades, however, are usually more\r\nchaffy and require 120 to 180 pounds to make a bushel. From 2 to 3 pounds\r\nof unhulled seed are therefore regarded as equivalent to 1 pound of hulled\r\nseed. A bushel of unhulled seed, even when well packed down, weighs only 6\r\nto 10 pounds and contains about 4 pounds of seed. The appearance of both\r\nhulled and unhulled crimson-clover seed is shown in figure 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Hulled seed of crimson clover of a common\r\ncommercial grade and unhulled seed gathered with a homemade stripper.\r\n(Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=USE OF A NURSE CROP.=\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the crimson-clover seedlings from the hot sun of late\r\nAugust it is a common practice in some sections to plant with the clover a\r\nsmall quantity of some quick-growing crop like buckwheat, cowpeas, rape,\r\nor turnips. A thin stand of these heavier leaved plants furnishes an ideal\r\nshade for the young clover, and on soils which are inclined to bake it\r\nprevents the formation of a crust. The nurse crop must be seeded lightly,\r\nusually not more than half the regular rate, as the ordinary stand shades\r\nthe ground so completely as to destroy the crimson clover. On hot clay\r\nsoil in the Piedmont region the chances of obtaining a stand of clover are\r\nabout twice as good with a nurse crop as without one.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is the principal nurse crop northward from Washington, D. C.\r\nA common rate of seeding is 2 to 3 pecks of buckwheat in 15 pounds of\r\ncrimson clover. If the planting can be made in July the buckwheat usually\r\nhas time to ripen before frost and thus pay the cost of starting both\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nIn the cotton belt cowpeas have been used successfully, especially\r\nwhen seeding on fallow ground. They are seeded broadcast at the rate\r\nof one-half bushel per acre. There is ordinarily not enough time for\r\nthe cowpeas to mature, but they add to the value of the stand for fall\r\npasturage and protect the clover from severe weather in the winter. Both\r\ncowpeas and buckwheat have the merit of being able to grow on poor soil.\r\n\r\nDwarf Essex rape has been used as a nurse crop in a few cases where the\r\nclover was to be pastured by hogs or sheep in the fall. From 2 to 3 pounds\r\nof rape, sown in August, furnishes sufficient cover for a nurse crop.\r\nCowhorn turnips, winter kale, and mustard are also satisfactory nurse\r\ncrops if planted at a rate not exceeding 1 pound of seed per acre. If the\r\nclover is to be saved for seed these latter crops are objectionable, as a\r\nfew plants will live over winter and ripen at the same time as the clover.\r\n\r\nWhere a nurse crop can not be grown conveniently, the crimson-clover\r\nseedlings can be protected from the sun by a light top-dressing of straw,\r\nspread just after the seed is sown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED MIXTURES.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is frequently grown in combination with winter grain, hairy\r\nvetch, or other forage crops having a similar period of growth. The mixed\r\ncrop is less liable to lodge than the single crop, cures more readily in\r\ndamp weather, and usually furnishes a heavier yield. Another advantage of\r\nthe mixed crop is that if either should fail the other will serve as a\r\ncover crop during the winter and bring some return the following spring.\r\nMixed crops are not desirable if the clover is to be saved for seed.\r\n\r\nSouth of central Virginia crimson clover is usually grown in combination\r\nwith winter oats. An early variety of oats, such as the Fulghum, or a late\r\nvariety of clover, such as the white blooming, is usually the best, as\r\nthe oat crop matures somewhat later than the ordinary crimson clover. The\r\ncustomary rate of seeding is 15 pounds of the clover and 2½ bushels of\r\noats per acre. In Delaware and eastern Maryland the most popular companion\r\ncrop for crimson clover is winter wheat, although barley makes a desirable\r\nhay crop and is sometimes used. Eye is not desirable for hay, but it\r\nis probably the best of the grains for green manure, as it is hardy,\r\nvigorous, and starts growth early in the spring. Rye and wheat are seeded\r\nat the rate of 1 bushel per acre with the customary quantity of crimson\r\nclover. The accompanying illustration (fig. 8) shows a field seeded to a\r\nmixture of crimson clover and wheat. Usually the grain is well headed,\r\nbut in the milk or soft-dough stage, when the clover is ready to cut, the\r\nyield of the mixed crimson clover and grain is often 25 to 50 per cent\r\ngreater than that of the clover alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Crimson clover and wheat in mixture. In the\r\nforeground the crop has been cut and fed green to stock. The remainder\r\nwas cut the next day for hay. The grain prevents the crimson clover from\r\nlodging.]\r\n\r\nHairy vetch and crimson clover are sometimes grown together, seeding at\r\nthe rate of 20 pounds and 10 pounds per acre, respectively. As both these\r\nplants are likely to lodge in good soil, however, one of the grains is\r\nusually included, a common seeding mixture being oats 2 bushels, hairy\r\nvetch 12 to 15 pounds, and crimson clover 5 pounds. Bur clover, black\r\nmedic, and other winter-growing legumes are sometimes found in mixtures\r\nwith crimson clover, although such mixtures generally occur by accident\r\nrather than intent. Black medic and crimson clover make' a particularly\r\ngood combination on rich soil.\r\n\r\nIn most of the crimson-clover area the cultivated grasses, such as\r\ntimothy, redtop, and orchard grass, are not commonly grown. However,\r\nwhere these grasses flourish they may well be seeded at the same time\r\nas the crimson clover, provided the latter is planted not earlier than\r\nSeptember 15. In some sections Johnson grass and Bermuda grass make useful\r\ncombinations with crimson clover, the grasses making most of their growth\r\nin the summer and the clover in the fall and spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=TREATMENT OF THE STAND.=\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinarily no special treatment is required after seeding and the clover\r\ngoes into the winter without any further handling. If the growth is so\r\nrank that there is danger of the plants being too succulent to survive the\r\nwinter, the tops can be reduced by light grazing with small animals, such\r\nas calves, sheep, or chickens, or by mowing with the cutter bar of the\r\nmowing machine set high. If the stand is backward, it may be stimulated\r\nby a light application of nitrate of soda. It is said that a thin stand\r\ncan be thickened by grazing lightly with sheep, as the grazing induces\r\nheavier stooling. The aim should be to carry the clover into the winter\r\nwith well-hardened leafy stems and with a well-established root system to\r\nwithstand heaving out in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn fields which are to be saved for seed a wise precaution is to go over\r\nthem early in the spring and chop out the weeds. If wild onion and other\r\nweeds are chopped off in April, they do not make enough growth by May to\r\ncontaminate the seed crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=MALADIES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only disease seriously affecting crimson clover is the clover\r\nstem-rot, root-rot, or wilt, a disease resembling the stem-rot, or wilt,\r\nof lettuce and other plants. This disease is prevalent in nearly all\r\nthe crimson-clover States and sometimes does considerable damage. The\r\nstem-rot affects the clover at all seasons, but is more noticeable in the\r\nspring, when it sometimes causes large spots of clover suddenly to wilt\r\nand fall. Occasionally an entire field is affected, but the disease is\r\nmost prevalent in low, rich spots. Examination of the plants discloses\r\na rotting off or decay of the stems close to the ground, followed\r\nimmediately by the appearance on the stems of small black lumps, or\r\nsclerotia, about the size of clover seed. These sclerotia are a means of\r\nspreading the disease and are often harvested in the hay or in the seed\r\ncrop. The only known remedy for the stem-rot is to cease growing clover or\r\nalfalfa on an infested field for three or four years, substituting cowpeas\r\nor soy beans. Seed from fields known to be infested should, of course, be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nNo insects are known to affect crimson clover seriously, nor are weeds\r\nof great importance in clover planted on clean fields. When planted in\r\ncultivated crops or in poorly prepared ground crimson clover is often\r\nseriously damaged by a rank growth of chickweed, knawel (moss weed),\r\nwinter cress, and other winter-growing annuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON : GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE : 1920\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transcriber Note=\r\n\r\nMinor typos have been corrected.
