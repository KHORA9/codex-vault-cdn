DELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work has been written in consequence of the great interest excited by\r\nmy article, under the same title, which appeared simultaneously in _The\r\nFortnightly Review_ and the _New York Independent_. Two friends who read\r\nthe manuscript were of opinion that a volume, in which the evidence could\r\nbe given much more fully, would be desirable, and the result of the\r\npublication of the article confirmed their view.\r\n\r\nI was led to a study of the subject when writing four new chapters on\r\nAstronomy for a new edition of _The Wonderful Century_. I then found that\r\nalmost all writers on general astronomy, from Sir John Herschel to\r\nProfessor Simon Newcomb and Sir Norman Lockyer, stated, as an indisputable\r\nfact, that our sun is situated _in_ the plane of the great ring of the\r\nMilky Way, and also very nearly in the centre of that ring. The most recent\r\nresearches also showed that there was little or no proof of there being any\r\nstars or nebulæ very far beyond the Milky Way, which thus seemed to be the\r\nlimit, in that direction, of the stellar universe.\r\n\r\nTurning to the earth and the other planets of the Solar System, I found\r\nthat the most recent researches led to the conclusion that no other planet\r\nwas likely to be the seat of organic life, unless perhaps of a very low\r\ntype. For many years I had paid special attention to the problem of the\r\nmeasurement of geological time, and also that of the mild climates and\r\ngenerally uniform conditions that had prevailed throughout all geological\r\nepochs; and on considering the number of concurrent causes and the delicate\r\nbalance of conditions required to maintain such uniformity, I became still\r\nmore convinced that the evidence was exceedingly strong against the\r\nprobability or possibility of any other planet being inhabited.\r\n\r\nHaving long been acquainted with most of the works dealing with the\r\nquestion of the supposed _Plurality of Worlds_, I was quite aware of the\r\nvery superficial treatment the subject had received, even in the hands of\r\nthe most able writers, and this made me the more willing to set forth the\r\nwhole of the available evidence--astronomical, physical, and biological--in\r\nsuch a way as to show both what was proved and what suggested by it.\r\n\r\nThe present work is the result, and I venture to think that those who will\r\nread it carefully will admit that it is a book that was worth writing. It\r\nis founded almost entirely on the marvellous body of facts and conclusions\r\nof the New Astronomy together with those reached by modern physicists,\r\nchemists, and biologists. Its novelty consists in combining the various\r\nresults of these different branches of science into a connected whole, so\r\nas to show their bearing upon a single problem--a problem which is of very\r\ngreat interest to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis problem is, whether or no the logical inferences to be drawn from the\r\nvarious results of modern science lend support to the view that our earth\r\nis the only inhabited planet, not only in the Solar System but in the\r\nwhole stellar universe. Of course it is a point as to which absolute\r\ndemonstration, one way or the other, is impossible. But in the absence of\r\nany direct proofs, it is clearly rational to inquire into probabilities;\r\nand these probabilities must be determined not by our prepossessions for\r\nany particular view, but by an absolutely impartial and unprejudiced\r\nexamination of the tendency of the evidence.\r\n\r\nAs the book is written for the general, educated body of readers, many of\r\nwhom may not be acquainted with any aspect of the subject or with the\r\nwonderful advance of recent knowledge in that department often termed the\r\nNew Astronomy, a popular account has been given of all those branches of it\r\nwhich bear upon the special subject here discussed. This part of the work\r\noccupies the first six chapters. Those who are fairly acquainted with\r\nmodern astronomical literature, as given in popular works, may begin at my\r\nseventh chapter, which marks the commencement of the considerable body of\r\nevidence and of argument I have been able to adduce.\r\n\r\nTo those of my readers who may have been influenced by any of the adverse\r\ncriticisms on my views as set forth in the article already referred to, I\r\nmust again urge, that throughout the whole of this work, neither the facts\r\nnor the more obvious conclusions from the facts are given on my own\r\nauthority, but always on that of the best astronomers, mathematicians, and\r\nother men of science to whose works I have had access, and whose names,\r\nwith exact references, I generally give.\r\n\r\nWhat I claim to have done is, to have brought together the various facts\r\nand phenomena _they_ have accumulated; to have set forth the hypotheses by\r\nwhich _they_ account for them, or the results to which the evidence clearly\r\npoints; to have judged between conflicting opinions and theories; and\r\nlastly, to have combined the results of the various widely-separated\r\ndepartments of science, and to have shown how they bear upon the great\r\nproblem which I have here endeavoured, in some slight degree, to elucidate.\r\n\r\nAs such a large body of facts and arguments from distinct sciences have\r\nbeen here brought together, I have given a rather full summary of the whole\r\nargument, and have stated my final conclusions in six short sentences. I\r\nthen briefly discuss the two aspects of the whole problem--those from the\r\nmaterialistic and from the spiritualistic points of view; and I conclude\r\nwith a few general observations on the almost unthinkable problems raised\r\nby ideas of Infinity--problems which some of my critics thought I had\r\nattempted in some degree to deal with, but which, I here point out, are\r\naltogether above and beyond the questions I have discussed, and equally\r\nabove and beyond the highest powers of the human intellect.\r\n\r\n    BROADSTONE, DORSET,\r\n\r\n    _September_ 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'The wilder'd mind is tost and lost,\r\n      O sea, in thy eternal tide;\r\n    The reeling brain essays in vain,\r\n      O stars, to grasp the vastness wide!\r\n    The terrible tremendous scheme\r\n      That glimmers in each glancing light,\r\n    O night, O stars, too rudely jars\r\n      The finite with the infinite!'\r\n\r\n    J.H.

PALGRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN'S PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nEARLY IDEAS AS TO THE UNIVERSE AND ITS RELATION TO MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen men attained to sufficient intelligence for speculations as to their\r\nown nature and that of the earth on which they lived, they must have been\r\nprofoundly impressed by the nightly pageant of the starry heavens. The\r\nintense sparkling brilliancy of Sirius and Vega, the more massive and\r\nsteady luminosity of Jupiter and Venus, the strange grouping of the\r\nbrighter stars into constellations to which fantastic names indicating\r\ntheir resemblance to various animals or terrestrial objects seemed\r\nappropriate and were soon generally adopted, together with the apparently\r\ninnumerable stars of less and less brilliancy scattered broadcast over the\r\nsky, many only being visible on the clearest nights and to the acutest\r\nvision, constituted altogether a scene of marvellous and impressive\r\nsplendour of which it must have seemed almost impossible to attain any real\r\nknowledge, but which afforded an endless field for the imagination of the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the stars to the sun and moon in their respective motions\r\nwas one of the earliest problems for the astronomer, and it was only\r\nsolved by careful and continuous observation, which showed that the\r\ninvisibility of the former during the day was wholly due to the blaze of\r\nlight, and this is said to have been proved at an early period by the\r\nobserved fact that from the bottom of very deep wells stars can be seen\r\nwhile the sun is shining. During total eclipses of the sun also the\r\nbrighter stars become visible, and, taken in connection with the fixity of\r\nposition of the pole-star, and the course of those circumpolar stars which\r\nnever set in the latitudes of Greece, Egypt, and Chaldea, it soon became\r\npossible to frame a simple hypothesis which supposed the earth to be\r\nsuspended in space, while at an unknown distance from it a crystal sphere\r\nrevolved upon an axis indicated by the pole-star, and carried with it the\r\nwhole host of heavenly bodies. This was the theory of Anaximander (540\r\nB.C.), and it served as the starting-point for the more complex theory\r\nwhich continued to be held in various forms and with endless modifications\r\ndown to the end of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the early Greeks obtained some knowledge of astronomy\r\nfrom the Chaldeans, who appear to have been the first systematic observers\r\nof the heavenly bodies by means of instruments, and who are said to have\r\ndiscovered the cycle of eighteen years and ten days after which the sun and\r\nmoon return to the same relative positions as seen from the earth. The\r\nEgyptians perhaps derived their knowledge from the same source, but there\r\nis no proof that they were great observers, and the accurate orientation,\r\nproportions, and angles of the Great Pyramid and its inner passages may\r\nperhaps indicate a Chaldean architect.\r\n\r\nThe very obvious dependence of the whole life of the earth upon the sun, as\r\na giver of heat and light, sufficiently explains the origin of the belief\r\nthat the latter was a mere appanage of the former; and as the moon also\r\nilluminates the night, while the stars as a whole also give a very\r\nperceptible amount of light, especially in the dry climate and clear\r\natmosphere of the East, and when compared with the pitchy darkness of\r\ncloudy nights when the moon is below the horizon, it seemed clear that the\r\nwhole of these grand luminaries--sun, moon, stars, and planets--were but\r\nparts of the terrestrial system, and existed solely for the benefit of its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles (444 B.C.) is said to have been the first who separated the\r\nplanets from the fixed stars, by observing their very peculiar motions,\r\nwhile Pythagoras and his followers determined correctly the order of their\r\nsuccession from Mercury to Saturn. No attempt was made to explain these\r\nmotions till a century later, when Eudoxus of Cnidos, a contemporary of\r\nPlato and of Aristotle, resided for some time in Egypt, where he became a\r\nskilful astronomer. He was the first who systematically worked out and\r\nexplained the various motions of the heavenly bodies on the theory of\r\ncircular and uniform motion round the earth as a centre, by means of a\r\nseries of concentric spheres, each revolving at a different rate and on a\r\ndifferent axis, but so united that all shared in the motion round the polar\r\naxis. The moon, for example, was supposed to be carried by three spheres,\r\nthe first revolved parallel to the equator and accounted for the diurnal\r\nmotion--the rising and setting--of the moon; another moved parallel to the\r\necliptic and explained the monthly changes of the moon; while the third\r\nrevolved at the same rate but more obliquely, and explained the inclination\r\nof the moon's orbit to that of the earth. In the same way each of the five\r\nplanets had four spheres, two moving like the first two of the moon,\r\nanother one also moving in the ecliptic was required to explain the\r\nretrograde motion of the planets, while a fourth oblique to the ecliptic\r\nwas needed to explain the diverging motions due to the different obliquity\r\nof the orbit of each planet to that of the earth. This was the celebrated\r\nPtolemaic system in the simplest form needed to account for the more\r\nobvious motions of the heavenly bodies. But in the course of ages the Greek\r\nand Arabian astronomical observers discovered small divergences due to the\r\nvarious degrees of excentricity of the orbits of the moon and planets and\r\ntheir consequent varying rates of motion; and to explain these other\r\nspheres were added, together with smaller circles sometimes revolving\r\nexcentrically, so that at length about sixty of these spheres, epicycles\r\nand excentrics were required to account for the various motions observed\r\nwith the rude instruments, and the rates of motion determined by the very\r\nimperfect time-measurers of those early ages. And although a few great\r\nphilosophers had at different times rejected this cumbrous system and had\r\nendeavoured to promulgate more correct ideas, their views had no influence\r\non public opinion even among astronomers and mathematicians, and the\r\nPtolemaic system held full sway down to the time of Copernicus, and was\r\nnot finally given up till Kepler's _Laws_ and Galileo's _Dialogues_\r\ncompelled the adoption of simpler and more intelligible theories.\r\n\r\nWe are now so accustomed to look upon the main facts of astronomy as mere\r\nelementary knowledge that it is difficult for us to picture to ourselves\r\nthe state of almost complete ignorance which prevailed even among the most\r\ncivilised nations throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages. The rotundity\r\nof the earth was held by a few at a very early period, and was fairly well\r\nestablished in later classical times. The rough determination of the size\r\nof our globe followed soon after; and when instrumental observations became\r\nmore perfect, the distance and size of the moon were measured with\r\nsufficient accuracy to show that it was very much smaller than the earth.\r\nBut this was the farthest limit of the determination of astronomical sizes\r\nand distances before the discovery of the telescope. Of the sun's real\r\ndistance and size nothing was known except that it was much farther from us\r\nand much larger than the moon; but even in the century before the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era Posidonius determined the circumference\r\nof the earth to be 240,000 stadia, equal to about 28,600 miles, a\r\nwonderfully close approximation considering the very imperfect data at his\r\ncommand. He is also said to have calculated the sun's distance, making it\r\nonly one-third less than the true amount, but this must have been a chance\r\ncoincidence, since he had no means of measuring angles more accurately than\r\nto one degree, whereas in the determination of the sun's distance\r\ninstruments are required which measure to a second of arc.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of the telescope the sizes of the planets were quite\r\nunknown, while the most that could be ascertained about the stars was, that\r\nthey were at a very great distance from us. This being the extent of the\r\nknowledge of the ancients as to the actual dimensions and constitution of\r\nthe visible universe, of which, be it remembered, the earth was held to be\r\nthe centre, we cannot be surprised at the almost universal belief that this\r\nuniverse existed solely for the earth and its inhabitants. In classical\r\ntimes it was held to be at once the dwelling-place of the gods and their\r\ngift to man, while in Christian ages this belief was but slightly, if at\r\nall, changed; and in both it would have been considered impious to maintain\r\nthat the planets and stars did not exist for the service and delight of\r\nmankind alone but in all probability had their own inhabitants, who might\r\nin some cases be even superior in intellect to man himself. But apparently,\r\nduring the whole period of which we are now treating, no one was so daring\r\nas even to suggest that there were other worlds with other inhabitants, and\r\nit was no doubt because of the idea that we occupied _the_ world, the very\r\ncentre of the whole surrounding universe which existed solely for us, that\r\nthe discoveries of Copernicus, Tycho Brahé, Kepler, and Galileo excited so\r\nmuch antagonism and were held to be impious and altogether incredible. They\r\nseemed to upset the whole accepted order of nature, and to degrade man by\r\nremoving his dwelling-place, the earth, from the commanding central\r\nposition it had always before occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMODERN IDEAS AS TO MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beliefs as to the subordinate position held by sun, moon, and stars in\r\nrelation to the earth, which were almost universal down to the time of\r\nCopernicus, began to give way when the discoveries of Kepler and the\r\nrevelations of the telescope demonstrated that our earth was not specially\r\ndistinguished from the other planets by any superiority of size or\r\nposition. The idea at once arose that the other planets might be inhabited;\r\nand when the rapidly increasing power of the telescope, and of astronomical\r\ninstruments generally, revealed the wonders of the solar system and the\r\never-increasing numbers of the fixed stars, the belief in other inhabited\r\nworlds became as general as the opposite belief had been in all preceding\r\nages, and it is still held in modified forms to the present day.\r\n\r\nBut it may be truly said that the later like the earlier belief is founded\r\nmore upon religious ideas than upon a scientific and careful examination of\r\nthe whole of the facts both astronomical, physical, and biological, and we\r\nmust agree with the late Dr. Whewell, that the belief that other planets\r\nare inhabited has been generally entertained, not in consequence of\r\nphysical reasons but in spite of them. And he adds:--'It was held that\r\nVenus, or that Saturn was inhabited, not because anyone could devise, with\r\nany degree of probability, any organised structure which would be suitable\r\nto animal existence on the surfaces of those planets; but because it was\r\nconceived that the greatness or goodness of the Creator, or His wisdom, or\r\nsome other of His attributes, would be manifestly imperfect, if these\r\nplanets were not tenanted by living creatures.' Those persons who have only\r\nheard that many eminent astronomers down to our own day have upheld the\r\nbelief in a 'Plurality of Worlds' will naturally suppose that there must be\r\nsome very cogent arguments in its favour, and that it must be supported by\r\na considerable body of more or less conclusive facts. They will therefore\r\nprobably be surprised to hear that any direct evidence which may be held to\r\nsupport the view is almost wholly wanting, and that the greater part of the\r\narguments are weak and flimsy in the extreme.\r\n\r\nOf late years, it is true, some few writers have ventured to point out how\r\nmany difficulties there are in the way of accepting the belief, but even\r\nthese have never examined the question from the various points of view\r\nwhich are essential to a proper consideration of it; while, so far as it is\r\nstill upheld, it is thought sufficient to show, that in the case of some of\r\nthe planets, there seem to be such conditions as to render life possible.\r\nIn the millions of planetary systems supposed to exist it is held to be\r\nincredible that there are not great numbers as well fitted to be inhabited\r\nby animals of all grades, including some as high as man or even higher,\r\nand that we must, therefore, believe that they are so inhabited. As in the\r\npresent work I propose to show, that the probabilities and the weight of\r\ndirect evidence tend to an exactly opposite conclusion, it will be well to\r\npass briefly in review the various writers on the subject, and to give some\r\nindication of the arguments they have used and the facts they have set\r\nforth. For the earlier upholders of the theory I am indebted to Dr.\r\nWhewell, who, in his _Dialogue on the Plurality of Worlds_--a Supplement to\r\nhis well-known volume on the subject--refers to all writers of importance\r\nknown to him.\r\n\r\nThe earliest are the great astronomers Kepler and Huygens, and the learned\r\nBishop Wilkins, who all believed that the moon was or might probably be\r\ninhabited; and of these Whewell considers Wilkins to have been by far the\r\nmost thoughtful and earnest in supporting his views. Then we have Sir Isaac\r\nNewton himself who, at considerable length, argued that the sun was\r\nprobably inhabited. But the first regular work devoted to the subject\r\nappears to have been written by M. Fontenelle, Secretary to the Academy of\r\nSciences in Paris, who in 1686 published his _Conversations on the\r\nPlurality of Worlds_. The book consisted of five chapters, the first\r\nexplaining the Copernican Theory; the second maintaining that the moon is a\r\nhabitable world; the third gives particulars as to the moon, and argues\r\nthat the other planets are also inhabited; the fourth gives details as to\r\nthe worlds of the five planets; while the fifth declares that the fixed\r\nstars are suns, and that each illuminates a world. This work was so well\r\nwritten, and the subject proved so attractive, that it was translated into\r\nall the chief European languages, while the astronomer Lalande edited one\r\nof the French editions. Three English translations were published, and one\r\nof these went through six editions down to the year 1737. The influence of\r\nthis work was very great and no doubt led to that general acceptance of the\r\ntheory by such men as Sir William Herschel, Sir John Herschel, Dr.\r\nChalmers, Dr. Dick, Dr. Isaac Taylor, and M. Arago, although it was wholly\r\nfounded on pure speculation, and there was nothing that could be called\r\nevidence on one side or the other.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of public opinion when an anonymous work appeared (in\r\n1853) under the somewhat misleading title of _The Plurality of Worlds: An\r\nEssay_. This was written, as already stated, by Dr. Whewell, who, for the\r\nfirst time, ventured to doubt the generally accepted theory, and showed\r\nthat all the evidence at our command led to the conclusion that some of the\r\nplanets were _certainly_ not habitable, that others were _probably_ not so,\r\nwhile in none was there that close correspondence with terrestrial\r\nconditions which seemed essential for their habitability by the higher\r\nanimals or by man. The book was ably written and showed considerable\r\nknowledge of the science of the time, but it was very diffuse, and the\r\nlarger part of it was devoted to showing that his views were not in any way\r\nopposed to religion. One of his best arguments was founded on the\r\nproposition that '_the Earth's Orbit is the Temperate Zone of the Solar\r\nSystem_,' that there only is it possible to have those moderate variations\r\nof heat and cold, dryness and moisture, which are suitable for animal\r\nlife. He suggested that the outer planets of the system consisted mainly of\r\nwater, gases, and vapour, as indicated by their low specific gravity, and\r\nwere therefore quite unsuitable for terrestrial life; while those near the\r\nsun were equally unsuited, because, owing to the great amount of solar\r\nheat, water could not exist on their surfaces. He devotes a great deal of\r\nspace to the evidence that there is no animal life on the moon, and taking\r\nthis as proved, he uses it as a counter argument against the other side.\r\nThey always urge that, the earth being inhabited, we must suppose the other\r\nplanets to be so too; to which he replies:--We know that the moon is not\r\ninhabited though it has all the advantage of proximity to the sun that the\r\nearth has; why then should not other planets be equally uninhabited?\r\n\r\nHe then comes to Mars and admits that this planet is very like the earth so\r\nfar as we can judge, and that it may therefore be inhabited, or as the\r\nauthor expresses it, 'may have been judged worthy of inhabitants by its\r\nMaker.' But he urges the small size of Mars, its coldness owing to distance\r\nfrom the sun, and that the annual melting of its polar ice-caps will keep\r\nit cold all through the summer. If there are animals they are probably of a\r\nlow type like the saurians and iguanodons of our seas during the Wealden\r\nepoch; but, he argues, as even on our earth the long process of preparation\r\nfor man was carried on for countless millions of years, we need not discuss\r\nwhether there are intelligent beings on Mars till we have some better\r\nevidence that there are any living creatures at all.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the early chapters are devoted to an attempt to minimise the\r\ndifficulties of those religious persons who feel oppressed by the immensity\r\nand complexity of the material universe as revealed by modern astronomy;\r\nand by the almost infinite insignificance of man and his dwelling-place,\r\nthe earth, in comparison with it, an insignificance vastly increased if not\r\nonly the planets of the solar system, but also those which circle around\r\nthe myriads of suns, are also theatres of life. And these persons are\r\nfurther disquieted because the very same facts are used by sceptics of\r\nvarious kinds in their attacks upon Christianity. Such writers point out\r\nthe irrationality and absurdity of supposing that the Creator of all this\r\nunimaginable vastness of suns and systems, filling for all we know endless\r\nspace, should take any _special_ interest in so mean and pitiful a creature\r\nas man, the imperfectly developed inhabitant of one of the smaller worlds\r\nattached to a second or third-rate sun, a being whose whole history is one\r\nof war and bloodshed, of tyranny, torture, and death; whose awful record is\r\npictured by himself in such books as Josephus' _History of the Jews_, the\r\n_Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, and even more forcibly summarised\r\nin that terrible picture of human fiendishness and misery, _The Martyrdom\r\nof Man_; while their character is indicated by one of the kindest and\r\nsimplest of their poets in the restrained but expressive lines:--\r\n\r\n    'Man's inhumanity to man\r\n    Makes countless thousands mourn.'\r\n\r\nIt is for such a being as this, they say, that God should have specially\r\nrevealed His will some thousands of years ago, and finding that His\r\ncommands were not obeyed, His will not fulfilled, yet ordained for their\r\nbenefit the necessarily unique sacrifice of His Son, in order to save a\r\nsmall portion of these 'miserable sinners' from the natural and\r\nwell-deserved consequence of their stupendous follies, their unimaginable\r\ncrimes? Such a belief they maintain is too absurd, too incredible, to be\r\nheld by any rational being, and it becomes even less credible and less\r\nrational if we maintain that there are countless other inhabited worlds.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for the religious man to make any adequate reply to\r\nsuch an attack as this, and as a result many have felt their position to be\r\nuntenable and have accordingly lost all faith in the special dogmas of\r\northodox Christianity. They feel themselves really to be between the horns\r\nof a dilemma. If there are myriads of other worlds, it seems incredible\r\nthat they should each be the object of a special revelation and a special\r\nsacrifice. If, on the other hand, we are the only intelligent beings that\r\nexist in the material universe, and are really the highest creative product\r\nof a Being of infinite wisdom and power, they cannot but wonder at the vast\r\napparent disproportion between the Creator and the created, and are\r\nsometimes driven to Atheism from the hopelessness of comprehending so mean\r\nand petty a result as the sole outcome of infinite power.\r\n\r\nWhewell tells us that the great preacher, Dr. Chalmers, in his Astronomical\r\nDiscourses, attempted a reply to these difficulties, but, in his opinion,\r\nnot a very successful one; and a large part of his own work is devoted to\r\nthe same purpose. His main point seems to be that we know too little of the\r\nuniverse to arrive at any definite conclusions on the question at issue,\r\nand that any ideas that we may have as to the purposes of the Creator in\r\nforming the vast system we see around us are almost sure to be erroneous.\r\nWe must therefore be content to remain ignorant, and must rest satisfied in\r\nthe belief that the Creator had a purpose although we are not yet permitted\r\nto know what it was. And to those who urge that in other worlds there may\r\nbe other laws of nature which may render them quite as habitable by\r\nintelligent beings as our world is for us, he replies, that if we are to\r\nsuppose new laws of nature in order to render each planet habitable, there\r\nis an end of all rational inquiry on the subject, and we may maintain and\r\nbelieve that animals may live on the moon without air or water, and on the\r\nsun exposed to heat which vaporises earths and metals.\r\n\r\nHis concluding argument, and perhaps one of his strongest, is that founded\r\nupon the dignity of man, as conferring a pre-eminence upon the planet which\r\nhas produced him. 'If,' he says, 'man be not merely capable of Virtue and\r\nDuty, of universal Love and Self-Devotion, but be also immortal; if his\r\nbeing be of infinite duration, his soul created never to die; then, indeed,\r\nwe may well say that one soul outweighs the whole unintelligent creation.'\r\nAnd then, addressing the religious world, he urges that, if, as they\r\nbelieve, God _has_ redeemed man by the sacrifice of His Son, and _has_\r\ngiven to him a revelation of His will, then indeed no other conception is\r\npossible than that he is the sole and highest product of the universe.\r\n'The elevation of millions of intellectual, moral, religious, spiritual\r\ncreatures, to a destiny so prepared, consummated, and developed, is no\r\nunworthy occupation of all the capacities of space, time, and matter.' Then\r\nwith a chapter on 'The Unity of the World,' and one on 'The Future,'\r\nneither of which contains anything which adds to the force of his argument,\r\nthe book ends.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this able if rather vague and diffuse work, contesting\r\npopular opinions, was followed by a burst of indignant criticism on the\r\npart of a man of considerable eminence in some branches of physics--Sir\r\nDavid Brewster, but who was very inferior, both in general knowledge of\r\nscience and in literary skill, to the writer whose views he opposed. The\r\npurport of the book in which he set forth his objections is indicated by\r\nits title--_More Worlds than One, the Creed of the Philosopher and the Hope\r\nof the Christian_. Though written with much force and conviction it appeals\r\nmainly to religious prejudices, and assumes throughout that every planet\r\nand star is a special creation, and that the peculiarities of each were\r\ndesigned for some special purpose. 'If,' he says, 'the moon had been\r\ndestined to be merely a lamp to our earth, there was no occasion to\r\nvariegate its surface with lofty mountains and extinct volcanoes, and cover\r\nit with large patches of matter that reflect different quantities of light\r\nand give its surface the appearance of continents and seas. It would have\r\nbeen a better lamp had it been a smooth piece of lime or of chalk.' It is,\r\ntherefore, he thinks, prepared for inhabitants; and then he argues that all\r\nthe other satellites are also inhabited. Again he says that 'when it was\r\nfound that Venus was about the same size as the Earth, with mountains and\r\nvalleys, days and nights, and years analogous to our own, the _absurdity_\r\nof believing that she had no inhabitants, when no other rational purpose\r\ncould be assigned for her creation, became an argument of a certain amount\r\nthat she was, like the Earth, the seat of animal and vegetable life.' Then,\r\nwhen it was found that Jupiter was so gigantic 'as to require four moons to\r\ngive him light, the argument from analogy that _he_ was inhabited became\r\nstronger also, because it extended to _two_ planets.' And thus each\r\nsuccessive planet having certain points of analogy with the others becomes\r\nan additional argument; so that when we take account of all the planets,\r\nwith atmosphere, and clouds, and arctic snows, and trade-winds, the\r\nargument from analogy becomes, he urges, very powerful;--'and the absurdity\r\nof the opposite opinion, that planets should have moons and no inhabitants,\r\natmospheres with no creatures to breathe in them, and currents of air\r\nwithout life to be fanned, became a formidable argument which few minds, if\r\nany, could resist.'\r\n\r\nThe work is full of such weak and fallacious rhetoric and even, if\r\npossible, still weaker. Thus after describing double stars, he adds--'But\r\nno person can believe that two suns could be placed in the heavens for no\r\nother purpose than to revolve round their common centre of gravity'; and he\r\nconcludes his chapter on the stars thus:--'Wherever there is matter there\r\nmust be Life; Life Physical to enjoy its beauties--Life Moral to worship\r\nits Maker, and Life Intellectual to proclaim His wisdom and His power.' And\r\nagain--'A house without tenants, a city without citizens, presents to our\r\nminds the same idea as a planet without life, and a universe without\r\ninhabitants. Why the house was built, why the city was founded, why the\r\nplanet was made, and why the universe was created, it would be difficult\r\neven to conjecture.' Arguments of this kind, which in almost every case beg\r\nthe question at issue, are repeated _ad nauseam_. But he also appeals to\r\nthe Old Testament to support his views, by quoting the fine passage in the\r\nPsalms--'When I consider Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers, the moon and\r\nthe stars which Thou hast ordained; what is man that Thou art mindful of\r\nhim?' on which he remarks--'We cannot doubt that inspiration revealed to\r\nhim [David] the magnitude, the distances, and the final cause, of the\r\nglorious spheres which fixed his admiration.' And after quoting various\r\nother passages from the prophets, all as he thinks supporting the same\r\nview, he sets forth the extraordinary idea as a confirmatory argument, that\r\nthe planets or some of them are to be the future abode of man. For, he\r\nsays--'Man in his future state of existence is to consist, as at present,\r\nof a spiritual nature residing in a corporeal frame. He must live,\r\ntherefore, upon a material planet, subject to all the laws of matter.' And\r\nhe concludes thus:--'If there is not room, then, on our globe for the\r\nmillions of millions of beings who have lived and died on its surface, we\r\ncan scarcely doubt that their future abode must be on some of the primary\r\nor secondary planets of the solar system, whose inhabitants have ceased to\r\nexist, or upon planets which have long been in a state of preparation, as\r\nour earth was, for the advent of intellectual life.'\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn from such weak and trivial arguments to the only\r\nother modern works which deal at some length with this subject, the late\r\nRichard A. Proctor's _Other Worlds than Ours_, and a volume published five\r\nyears later under the title--_Our Place Among Infinities_. Written as these\r\nwere by one of the most accomplished astronomers of his day, remarkable\r\nalike for the acuteness of his reasoning and the clearness of his style, we\r\nare always interested and instructed even when we cannot agree with his\r\nconclusions. In the first work mentioned above, he assumes, like Sir David\r\nBrewster, the antecedent probability that the planets are inhabited and on\r\nmuch the same theological grounds. So strongly does he feel this that he\r\ncontinually speaks as if the planets _must_ be inhabited unless we can show\r\nvery good reason that they _cannot_ be so, thus throwing the burden of\r\nproving a negative on his opponents, while he does not attempt to prove his\r\npositive contention that they are inhabited, except by purely hypothetical\r\nconsiderations as to the Creator's purpose in bringing them into existence.\r\n\r\nBut starting from this point he endeavours to show how Whewell's various\r\ndifficulties may be overcome, and here he always appeals to astronomical or\r\nphysical facts, and reasons well upon them. But he is quite honest; and,\r\ncoming to the conclusion that Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,\r\ncannot be habitable, he adduces the evidence and plainly states the result.\r\nBut then he thinks that the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn _may_ be\r\nhabitable, and if they may be, then he concludes that they _must_. One\r\ngreat oversight in his whole argument is, that he is satisfied with showing\r\nthe possibility that life may exist now, but never deals with the question\r\nof whether life could have been developed from its earliest rudiments up to\r\nthe production of the higher vertebrates and man; and this, as I shall show\r\nlater, is the _crux_ of the whole problem.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other planets, after a careful examination of all that\r\nis known about them, he arrives at the conclusion that if Mercury is\r\nprotected by a cloud-laden atmosphere of a peculiar kind it may possibly,\r\nbut not probably, support high forms of animal life. But in the case of\r\nVenus and Mars he finds so much resemblance to and so many analogies with\r\nour earth, that he concludes that they almost certainly are so.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the fixed stars, now that we know by spectroscopic\r\nobservations that they are true suns, many of which closely resemble our\r\nsun and give out light and heat as he does, Mr. Proctor argues, that 'The\r\nvast supplies of heat thus emitted by the stars not only suggest the\r\nconclusion that there must be worlds around these orbs for which these\r\nheat-supplies are intended, but point to the existence of the various forms\r\nof force into which heat may be transmuted. We know that the sun's heat\r\npoured upon our earth is stored up in vegetable and animal forms of life;\r\nis present in all the phenomena of nature--in winds and clouds and rain, in\r\nthunder and lightning, storm and hail; and that even the works of man are\r\nperformed by virtue of the solar heat-supplies. Thus the fact that the\r\nstars send forth heat to the worlds which circle around them suggests at\r\nonce the thought that on those worlds there must exist animal and vegetable\r\nforms of life.' We may note that in the first part of this passage the\r\npresence of worlds or planets is 'suggested,' while later on 'the worlds\r\nwhich circle round them' is spoken of as if it were a proved fact from\r\nwhich the presence of vegetable and animal life may be inferred. A\r\nsuggestion depending on a preceding suggestion is not a very firm basis for\r\nso vast and wide-reaching a conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the second work referred to above there is one chapter entitled, 'A New\r\nTheory of Life in other Worlds,' where the author gives his more matured\r\nviews of the question, which are briefly stated in the preface as being\r\n'that the weight of evidence favours my theory of the (relative) paucity of\r\nworlds.' His views are largely founded on the theory of probabilities, of\r\nwhich subject he had made a special study. Taking first our earth, he shows\r\nthat the period during which life has existed upon it is very small in\r\ncomparison with that during which it must have been slowly forming and\r\ncooling, and its atmosphere condensing so as to form land and water on its\r\nsurface. And if we consider the time the earth has been occupied by man,\r\nthat is a very minute part, perhaps not the thousandth part, of the period\r\nduring which it has existed as a planet. It follows that even if we\r\nconsider only those planets whose physical condition seems to us to be such\r\nas to be able to sustain life, the chances are perhaps hundreds to one\r\nagainst their being at that particular stage when life has begun to be\r\ndeveloped, or if it has begun has reached as high a development as on our\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the stars, the argument is still stronger, because the\r\nepochs required for their formation are altogether unknown, while as to the\r\nconditions required for the formation of planetary systems around them we\r\nare totally ignorant. To this I would add that we are equally ignorant as\r\nto the probability or even possibility of many of these suns producing\r\nplanets which, by their position, size, atmosphere, or other physical\r\nconditions can possibly become life-producing worlds. And, as we shall see\r\nlater, this point has been overlooked by all writers, including Mr. Proctor\r\nhimself. His conclusion is, then, that although the worlds which possess\r\nlife at all approaching that of our earth may be relatively few in number,\r\nyet considering the universe as practically infinite in extent, they may be\r\nreally very numerous.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to give this sketch of the views of those who have\r\nwritten specially on the question of the Plurality of Worlds, because the\r\nworks referred to have been very widely read and have influenced educated\r\nopinion throughout the world. Moreover, Mr. Proctor, in his last work on\r\nthe subject, speaks of the theory as being 'identified with modern\r\nastronomy'; and in fact popular works still discuss it. But all these\r\nfollow the same general line of argument as those already referred to, and\r\nthe curious thing is that while overlooking many of the most essential\r\nconditions they often introduce others which are by no means essential--as,\r\nfor instance, that the atmosphere must have the same proportion of oxygen\r\nas our own. They seem to think that if any of our quadrupeds or birds taken\r\nto another planet could not live there, no animals of equally high\r\norganisation could inhabit it; entirely overlooking the very obvious fact\r\nthat, supposing, as is almost certain, that oxygen is necessary for life,\r\nthen, whatever proportion of oxygen within certain limits was present, the\r\nforms of life that arose would necessarily be organised in adaptation to\r\nthat proportion, which might be considerably less or greater than on the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe present volume will show how extremely inadequate has been the\r\ntreatment of this question, which involves a variety of important\r\nconsiderations hitherto altogether overlooked. These are extremely numerous\r\nand very varied in their character, and the fact that they all point to one\r\nconclusion--a conclusion which so far as I am aware no previous writer has\r\nreached--renders it at least worthy of the careful consideration of all\r\nunbiassed thinkers. The whole subject is one as to which no direct evidence\r\nis obtainable, but I venture to think that the convergence of so many\r\nprobabilities and indications towards a single definite theory, intimately\r\nconnected with the nature and destiny of man himself, raises this theory to\r\na very much higher level of probability than the vague possibilities and\r\ntheological suggestions which are the utmost that have been adduced by\r\nprevious writers.\r\n\r\nIn order to make every step of my argument clearly intelligible to all\r\neducated readers, it will be necessary to refer continually to the\r\nmarvellous extension of our knowledge of the universe obtained during the\r\nlast half-century, and constituting what is termed the New Astronomy. The\r\nnext chapter will therefore be devoted to a popular exposition of the new\r\nmethods of research, so that the results reached, which will have to be\r\nreferred to in succeeding chapters, may be not only accepted, but clearly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the nineteenth century discoveries were made\r\nwhich extended the powers of astronomical research into entirely new and\r\nunexpected regions, comparable to those which were opened up by the\r\ndiscovery of the telescope more than two centuries before. The older\r\nastronomy for more than two thousand years was purely mechanical and\r\nmathematical, being limited to observation and measurement of the apparent\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies, and the attempts to deduce, from these\r\napparent motions, their real motions, and thus determine the actual\r\nstructure of the solar system. This was first done when Kepler established\r\nhis three celebrated laws: and later, when Newton showed that these laws\r\nwere necessary consequences of the one law of gravitation, and when\r\nsucceeding observers and mathematicians proved that each fresh irregularity\r\nin the motions of the planets was explicable by a more thorough and minute\r\napplication of the same laws, this branch of astronomy reached its highest\r\npoint of efficiency and left very little more to be desired.\r\n\r\nThen, as the telescope became successively improved, the centre of interest\r\nwas shifted to the surfaces of the planets and their satellites, which\r\nwere watched and scrutinised with the greatest assiduity in order if\r\npossible to attain some amount of knowledge of their physical constitution\r\nand past history. A similar minute scrutiny was given to the stars and\r\nnebulæ, their distribution and grouping, and the whole heavens were mapped\r\nout, and elaborate catalogues constructed by enthusiastic astronomers in\r\nevery part of the world. Others devoted themselves to the immensely\r\ndifficult problem of determining the distances of the stars, and by the\r\nmiddle of the century a few such distances had been satisfactorily\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nThus, up to the middle of the nineteenth century it appeared likely that\r\nthe future of astronomy would rest almost entirely on the improvement of\r\nthe telescope, and of the various instruments of measurement by means of\r\nwhich more accurate determinations of distances might be obtained. Indeed,\r\nthe author of the Positive Philosophy, Auguste Comte, felt so sure of this\r\nthat he deprecated all further attention to the stars as pure waste of time\r\nthat could never lead to any useful or interesting result. In his\r\n_Philosophical Treatise on Popular Astronomy_ published in 1844, he wrote\r\nvery strongly on this point. He there tells us that, as the stars are only\r\naccessible to us by sight they must always remain very imperfectly known.\r\nWe can know little more than their mere existence. Even as regards so\r\nsimple a phenomenon as their temperature this must always be inappreciable\r\nto a purely visual examination. Our knowledge of the stars is for the most\r\npart purely negative, that is, we can determine only that they do _not_\r\nbelong to our system. Outside that system there exists, in astronomy, only\r\nobscurity and confusion, for want of indispensable facts; and he concludes\r\nthus:--'It is, then, in vain that for half a century it has been\r\nendeavoured to distinguish two astronomies, the one solar the other\r\nsidereal. In the eyes of those for whom science consists of real laws and\r\nnot of incoherent facts, the second exists only in name, and the first\r\nalone constitutes a true astronomy; and I am not afraid to assert that it\r\nwill always be so.' And he adds that--'all efforts directed to this subject\r\nfor half a century have only produced an accumulation of incoherent\r\nempirical facts which can only interest an irrational curiosity.'\r\n\r\nSeldom has a confident assertion of finality in science received so\r\ncrushing a reply as was given to the above statements of Comte by the\r\ndiscovery in 1860 (only three years after his death) of the method of\r\nspectrum-analysis which, in its application to the stars, has\r\nrevolutionised astronomy, and has enabled us to obtain that very kind of\r\nknowledge which he declared must be for ever beyond our reach. Through it\r\nwe have acquired accurate information as to the physics and chemistry of\r\nthe stars and nebulæ, so that we now know really more of the nature,\r\nconstitution, and temperature of the enormously distant suns which we\r\ndistinguish by the general term stars, than we do of most of the planets of\r\nour own system. It has also enabled us to ascertain the existence of\r\nnumerous invisible stars, and to determine their orbits, their rate of\r\nmotion, and even, approximately, their mass. The despised stellar astronomy\r\nof the early part of the century has now taken rank as the most profoundly\r\ninteresting department of that grand science, and the branch which offers\r\nthe greatest promise of future discoveries. As the results obtained by\r\nmeans of this powerful instrument will often be referred to, a short\r\naccount of its nature and of the principles on which it depends must here\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nThe solar spectrum is the band of coloured light seen in the rainbow and,\r\npartially, in the dew-drop, but more completely when a ray of sunlight\r\npasses through a prism--a piece of glass having a triangular section. The\r\nresult is, that instead of a spot of white light we have a narrow band of\r\nbrilliant colours which succeed each other in regular order, from violet at\r\none end through blue, green, and yellow to red at the other. We thus see\r\nthat light is not a simple and uniform radiation from the sun, but is made\r\nup of a large number of separate rays, each of which produces in our eyes\r\nthe sensation of a distinct colour. Light is now explained as being due to\r\nvibrations of ether, that mysterious substance which not only permeates all\r\nmatter, but which fills space at least as far as the remotest of the\r\nvisible stars and nebulæ. The exceedingly minute waves or vibrations of the\r\nether produce all the phenomena of heat, light, and colour, as well as\r\nthose chemical actions to which photography owes its wonderful powers. By\r\ningenious experiments the size and rate of vibration of these waves have\r\nbeen measured, and it is found that they vary considerably, those forming\r\nthe red light, which is least refracted, having a wave-length of about\r\n1/326000 of an inch, while the violet rays at the other end of the spectrum\r\nare only about half that length or 1/630000 of an inch. The rate at which\r\nthe vibrations succeed each other is from 302 millions of millions per\r\nsecond for the extreme red rays, to 737 millions of millions for those at\r\nthe violet end of the spectrum. These figures are given to show the\r\nwonderful minuteness and rapidity of these heat and light waves on which\r\nthe whole life of the world, and all our knowledge of other worlds and\r\nother suns, directly depends.\r\n\r\nBut the mere colours of the spectrum are not the most important part of it.\r\nVery early in the nineteenth century a close examination showed that it was\r\neverywhere crossed by black lines of various thicknesses, sometimes single,\r\nsometimes grouped together. Many observers studied them and made accurate\r\ndrawings or maps showing their positions and thicknesses, and by combining\r\nseveral prisms, so that the beam of sunlight had to pass through them\r\nsuccessively, a spectrum could be produced several feet long, and more than\r\n3000 of these dark lines were counted in it. But what they were and how\r\nthey were caused remained a mystery, till, in the year 1860, the German\r\nphysicist Kirchhoff discovered the secret and gave to chemists and\r\nastronomers a new and quite unexpected engine of research.\r\n\r\nIt had already been observed that the chemical elements and various\r\ncompounds, when heated to incandescence, produced spectra consisting of\r\ncoloured lines or bands which were constant for each element, so that the\r\nelements could at once be recognised by their characteristic spectra; and\r\nit had also been noticed that some of these bands, especially the yellow\r\nband produced by sodium, corresponded in position with certain black lines\r\nin the solar spectrum. Kirchhoff's discovery consisted in showing that,\r\nwhen the light from an incandescent body passes through the same substance\r\nin a state of vapour or gas, so much of the light is absorbed that the\r\ncoloured lines or bands become black. The mystery of more than half a\r\ncentury was thus solved; and the thousands of black lines in the solar\r\nspectrum were shown to be caused by the light from the incandescent matter\r\nof the sun's surface passing through the heated gases or vapours\r\nimmediately above it, and thereby having the bright coloured lines of their\r\nspectra changed, by absorption, to comparative blackness.\r\n\r\nChemists and physicists immediately set to work examining the spectra of\r\nthe elements, fixing the position of the several coloured lines or bands by\r\naccurate measurement, and comparing them with the dark lines of the solar\r\nspectrum. The results were in the highest degree satisfactory. In a large\r\nproportion of the elements the coloured bands corresponded exactly with a\r\ngroup of dark lines in the spectrum of the sun, in which, therefore, the\r\nsame terrestrial elements were proved to exist. Among the elements first\r\ndetected in this manner were hydrogen, sodium, iron, copper, magnesium,\r\nzinc, calcium, and many others. Nearly forty of the elements have now been\r\nfound in the sun, and it seems highly probable that all our elements really\r\nexist there, but as some are very rare and are present in very minute\r\nquantities they cannot be detected. Some of the dark lines in the sun were\r\nfound not to correspond to any known element, and as this was thought to\r\nindicate an element peculiar to the sun it was named Helium; but quite\r\nrecently it has been discovered in a rare mineral. Many of the elements\r\nare represented by a great number of lines, others by very few. Thus iron\r\nhas more than 2000, while lead and potassium have only one each.\r\n\r\nThe value of the spectroscope both to the chemist in discovering new\r\nelements and to the astronomer in determining the constitution of the\r\nheavenly bodies, is so great, that it became of the highest importance to\r\nhave the position of all the dark lines in the solar spectrum, as well as\r\nthe bright lines of all the elements, determined with extreme accuracy, so\r\nas to be able to make exact comparisons between different spectra. At first\r\nthis was done by means of very large-scale drawings showing the exact\r\nposition of every dark or bright line. But this was found to be both\r\ninconvenient and not sufficiently exact; and it was therefore agreed to\r\nadopt the natural scale of the wave-lengths of the different parts of the\r\nspectrum, which by means of what are termed diffraction-gratings can now be\r\nmeasured with great accuracy. Diffraction-gratings are formed of a polished\r\nsurface of hard metal ruled with excessively fine lines, sometimes as many\r\nas 20,000 to an inch. When sunlight falls upon one of these gratings it is\r\nreflected, and by interference of the rays from the spaces between the fine\r\ngrooves, it is spread out into a beautiful and well-defined spectrum,\r\nwhich, when the lines are very close, is several yards in length. In these\r\ndiffraction spectra many dark lines are seen which can be shown in no other\r\nway, and they also give a spectrum which is far more uniform than that\r\nproduced by glass prisms in which minute differences in the composition of\r\nthe glass cause some rays to be refracted more and others less than the\r\nnormal amount.\r\n\r\nThe spectra produced by diffraction-gratings are double; that is, they are\r\nspread out on both sides of the central line of the ray which remains\r\nwhite, and the several coloured or dark lines are so clearly defined that\r\nthey can be thrown on a screen at a considerable distance, giving a great\r\nlength to the spectrum. The data for obtaining the wave-lengths are the\r\ndistance apart of the lines, the distance of the screen, and the distance\r\napart of the first pair of dark lines on each side of the central bright\r\nline. All these can be measured with extreme accuracy by means of\r\ntelescopes with micrometers and other contrivances, and the result is an\r\naccuracy of determination of wave-lengths which can probably not be\r\nequalled in any other kind of measurement.\r\n\r\nAs the wave-lengths are so excessively minute, it has been found convenient\r\nto fix upon a still smaller unit of measurement, and as the millimetre is\r\nthe smallest unit of the metric system, the ten-millionth of a millimetre\r\n(technically termed 'tenth meter') is the unit adopted for the measurement\r\nof wave-lengths, which is equal to about the 250 millionth of an inch. Thus\r\nthe wave-lengths of the red and blue lines characteristic of hydrogen are\r\n6563.07 and 4861.51 respectively. This excessively minute scale of\r\nwave-lengths, once determined by the most refined measurement, is of very\r\ngreat importance. Having the wave-lengths of any two lines of a spectrum so\r\ndetermined, the space between them can be laid down on a diagram of any\r\nlength, and all the lines that occur in any other spectrum between these\r\ntwo lines can be marked in their exact relative positions. Now, as the\r\nvisible spectrum consists of about 300,000 rays of light, each of different\r\nwave-lengths and therefore of different refrangibilities, if it is laid\r\ndown on such a scale as to be of a length of 3000 inches (250 feet), each\r\nwave-length will be 1/100 of an inch long, a space easily visible by the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nThe possession of an instrument of such wonderful delicacy, and with powers\r\nwhich enable it to penetrate into the inner constitution of the remotest\r\norbs of space, rendered it possible, within the next quarter of a century,\r\nto establish what is practically a new science--Astrophysics--often\r\npopularly termed the New Astronomy. A brief outline of the main\r\nachievements of this science must now be given.\r\n\r\nThe first great discovery made by Spectrum analysis, after the\r\ninterpretation of the sun's spectrum had been obtained, was, the real\r\nnature of the fixed stars. It is true they had long been held by\r\nastronomers to be suns, but this was only an opinion of the accuracy of\r\nwhich it did not seem possible to obtain any proof. The opinion was founded\r\non two facts--their enormous distance from us, so great that the whole\r\ndiameter of the earth's orbit did not lead to any apparent change of their\r\nrelative positions, and their intense brilliancy which at such distances\r\ncould only be due to an actual size and splendour comparable with our sun.\r\nThe spectroscope at once proved the correctness of this opinion. As one\r\nafter another was examined, they were found to exhibit spectra of the same\r\ngeneral type as that of the sun--a band of colours crossed by dark lines.\r\nThe very first stars examined by Sir William Huggins showed the existence\r\nof nine or ten of our elements. Very soon all the chief stars of the\r\nheavens were spectroscopically examined, and it was found that they could\r\nbe classed in three or four groups. The first and largest group contains\r\nmore than half the visible stars, and a still larger proportion of the most\r\nbrilliant, such as Sirius, Vega, Regulus, and Alpha Crucis in the Southern\r\nHemisphere. They are characterised by a white or bluish light, rich in the\r\nultra-violet rays, and their spectra are distinguished by the breadth and\r\nintensity of the four dark bands due to the absorption of hydrogen, while\r\nthe various black lines which indicate metallic vapours are comparatively\r\nfew, though hundreds of them can be discovered by careful examination.\r\n\r\nThe next group, to which Capella and Arcturus belong, is also very\r\nnumerous, and forms the solar type of stars. Their light is of a yellowish\r\ncolour, and their spectra are crossed throughout by innumerable fine dark\r\nlines more or less closely corresponding with those in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe third group consists of red and variable stars, which are characterised\r\nby fluted spectra. Such spectra show like a range of Doric columns seen in\r\nperspective, the red side being that most illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe last group, consisting of few and comparatively small stars, has also\r\nfluted spectra, but the light appears to come from the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThese groups were established by Father Secchi, the Roman astronomer, in\r\n1867, and have been adopted with some modifications by Vogel of the\r\nAstrophysical Observatory at Potsdam. The exact interpretation of these\r\ndifferent spectra is somewhat uncertain, but there can be little doubt that\r\nthey coincide primarily with differences of temperature and with\r\ncorresponding differences in the composition and extent of the absorptive\r\natmospheres. Stars with fluted spectra indicate the presence of vapours of\r\nthe metalloids or of compound substances, while the reversed flutings\r\nindicate the presence of carbon. These conclusions have been reached by\r\ncareful laboratory experiments which are now carried on at the same time as\r\nthe spectral examination of the stars and other heavenly bodies, so that\r\neach peculiarity of their spectra, however puzzling and apparently\r\nunmeaning, has been usually explained, by being shown to indicate certain\r\nconditions of chemical constitution or of temperature.\r\n\r\nBut whatever difficulty there may be in explaining details, there remains\r\nno doubt whatever of the fundamental fact that all the stars are true suns,\r\ndiffering no doubt in size, and their stage of development as indicated by\r\nthe colour or intensity of their light or heat, but all alike possessing a\r\nphotosphere or light-emitting surface, and absorptive atmospheres of\r\nvarious qualities and density.\r\n\r\nInnumerable other details, such as the often contrasted colours of double\r\nstars, the occasional variability of their spectra, their relations to the\r\nnebulæ, the various stages of their development and other problems of equal\r\ninterest, have occupied the continued attention of astronomers,\r\nspectroscopists, and chemists; but further reference to these difficult\r\nquestions would be out of place here. The present sketch of the nature of\r\nspectrum-analysis applied to the stars is for the purpose of making its\r\nprinciple and method of observation intelligible to every educated reader,\r\nand to illustrate the marvellous precision and accuracy of the results\r\nattained by it. So confident are astronomers of this accuracy that nothing\r\nless than _perfect correspondence_ of the various bright lines in the\r\nspectrum of an element in the laboratory with the dark lines in the\r\nspectrum of the sun or of a star is required before the presence of that\r\nelement is accepted as proved. As Miss Clerke tersely puts\r\nit--'Spectroscopic coincidences admit of no compromise. Either they are\r\nabsolute or they are worthless.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF MOTION IN THE LINE OF SIGHT\r\n\r\nWe must now describe another and quite distinct application of the\r\nspectroscope, which is even more marvellous than that already described. It\r\nis the method of measuring the rate of motion of any of the visible\r\nheavenly bodies in a direction either directly towards us, or directly away\r\nfrom us, technically described as 'radial motion,' or by the\r\nexpression--'in the line of sight.' And the extraordinary thing is that\r\nthis power of measurement is altogether independent of distance, so that\r\nthe rate of motion in miles per second of the remotest of the fixed stars,\r\nif sufficiently bright to show a distinct spectrum, can be measured with as\r\nmuch certainty and accuracy as in the case of a much nearer star or a\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how this is possible we have again to refer to the\r\nwave-theory of light; and the analogy of other wave-motions will enable us\r\nbetter to grasp the principle on which these calculations depend. If on a\r\nnearly calm day we count the waves that pass each minute by an anchored\r\nsteamboat, and then travel in the direction the waves come from, we shall\r\nfind that a larger number pass us in the same time. Again, if we are\r\nstanding near a railway, and an engine comes towards us whistling, we shall\r\nnotice that it changes its tone as it passes us; and as it recedes the\r\nsound will be in a lower key, although the engine may be at exactly the\r\nsame distance from us as when it was approaching. Yet the sound does not\r\nchange to the ear of the engine driver, the cause of the change being that\r\nthe sound-waves reach us in quicker succession as the source of the waves\r\nis approaching us than when it is retreating from us. Now, just as the\r\npitch of a note depends upon the rapidity with which the successive\r\nair-vibrations reach our ear, so does the colour of a particular part of\r\nthe spectrum depend upon the rapidity with which the ethereal waves which\r\nproduce colour reach our eyes; and as this rapidity is greater when the\r\nsource of the light is approaching than when it is receding from us, a\r\nslight shifting of the position of the coloured bands, and therefore of the\r\ndark lines, will occur, as compared with their position in the spectrum of\r\nthe sun or of any stationary source of light, if there is any motion\r\nsufficient in amount to produce a perceptible shift.\r\n\r\nThat such a change of colour would occur was pointed out by Professor\r\nDoppler of Prague in 1842, and it is hence usually spoken of as the\r\n'Doppler principle'; but as the changes of colour were so minute as to be\r\nimpossible of measurement it was not at that time of any practical\r\nimportance in astronomy. But when the dark lines in the spectrum were\r\ncarefully mapped, and their positions determined with minute accuracy, it\r\nwas seen that a means of measuring the changes produced by motion in the\r\nline of sight existed, since the position of any of the dark or coloured\r\nlines in the spectra of the heavenly bodies could be compared with those of\r\nthe corresponding lines produced artificially in the laboratory. This was\r\nfirst done in 1868 by Sir William Huggins, who, by the use of a very\r\npowerful spectroscope constructed for the purpose, found that such a change\r\ndid occur in the case of many stars, and that their rate of motion towards\r\nus or away from us--the radial motion--could be calculated. As the actual\r\ndistance of some of these stars had been measured, and their change of\r\nposition annually (their proper motion) determined, the additional factor\r\nof the amount of motion in the direction of our line of sight completed the\r\ndata required to fix their true line of motion among the other stars. The\r\naccuracy of this method under favourable conditions and with the best\r\ninstruments is very great, as has been proved by those cases in which we\r\nhave independent means of calculating the real motion. The motion of Venus\r\ntowards or away from us can be calculated with great accuracy for any\r\nperiod, being a resultant of the combined motions of the planet and of our\r\nearth in their respective orbits. The radial motions of Venus were\r\ndetermined at the Lick Observatory in August and September 1890, by\r\nspectroscopic observations, and also by calculation, to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n             By Observation.                   By Calculation.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 16th. 7.3 miles per second.       8.1 miles per second.\r\n     \"   22nd. 8.9   \"   \"    \"            8.2    \"   \"     \"\r\n     \"   30th. 7.3   \"   \"    \"            8.3    \"   \"     \"\r\n    Sep.  3rd. 8.3   \"   \"    \"            8.3    \"   \"     \"\r\n     \"    4th. 8.2   \"   \"    \"            8.3    \"   \"     \"\r\n\r\nshowing that the maximum error was only one mile per second, while the mean\r\nerror was about a quarter of a mile. In the case of the stars the accuracy\r\nof the method has been tested by observations of the same star at times\r\nwhen the earth's motion in its orbit is towards or away from the star,\r\nwhose apparent radial velocity is, therefore, increased or diminished by a\r\nknown amount. Observations of this kind were made by Dr. Vogel, Director of\r\nthe Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam, showing, in the case of three\r\nstars, of which ten observations were taken, a mean error of about two\r\nmiles per second; but as the stellar motions are more rapid than those of\r\nthe planets, the proportionate error is no greater than in the example\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of this mode of determining the real motion of the\r\nstars is, that it gives us a knowledge of the scale on which such motions\r\nare progressing; and when in the course of time we discover whether any of\r\ntheir paths are rectilinear or curved, we shall be in a position to learn\r\nsomething of the nature of the changes that are going on and of the laws on\r\nwhich they depend.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVISIBLE STARS AND IMPERCEPTIBLE MOTIONS\r\n\r\nBut there is another result of this power of determining radial motion\r\nwhich is even more unexpected and marvellous, and which has extended our\r\nknowledge of the stars in quite a new direction. By its means it is\r\npossible to determine the existence of invisible stars and to measure the\r\nrate of otherwise imperceptible motions; that is of stars which are\r\ninvisible in the most powerful modern telescopes, and whose motions have\r\nsuch a limited range that no telescope can detect them.\r\n\r\nDouble or binary stars forming systems which revolve around their common\r\ncentre of gravity were discovered by Sir William Herschel, and very great\r\nnumbers are known; but in most cases their periods of revolution are long,\r\nthe shortest being about twelve years, while many extend to several hundred\r\nyears. These are, of course, all visible binaries, but many are now known\r\nof which one star only is visible while the other is either non-luminous or\r\nis so close to its companion that they appear as a single star in the most\r\npowerful telescopes. Many of the variable stars belong to the former class,\r\na good example of which is Algol in the constellation Perseus, which\r\nchanges from the second to the fourth magnitude in about four and a half\r\nhours, and in about four and a half hours more regains its brilliancy till\r\nits next period of obscuration which occurs regularly every two days and\r\ntwenty-one hours. The name Algol is from the Arabic _Al Ghoul_, the\r\nfamiliar 'ghoul' of the Arabian Nights, so named--'The Demon'--from its\r\nstrange and weird behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt had long been conjectured that this obscuration was due to a dark\r\ncompanion which partially eclipsed the bright star at every revolution,\r\nshowing that the plane of the orbit of the pair was almost exactly directed\r\ntowards us. The application of the spectroscope made this conjecture a\r\ncertainty. At an equal time before and after the obscuration, motion in the\r\nline of sight was shown, towards and away from us, at a rate of twenty-six\r\nmiles per second. From these scanty data and the laws of gravitation which\r\nfix the period of revolution of planets at various distances from their\r\ncentres of revolution, Professor Pickering of the Harvard Observatory was\r\nable to arrive at the following figures as highly probable, and they may be\r\nconsidered to be certainly not far from the truth.\r\n\r\n    Diameter of Algol,              1,061,000 miles.\r\n    Diameter of dark companion,       830,000   \"\r\n    Distance between their centres, 3,230,000   \"\r\n    Orbital speed of Algol,              26.3 miles per sec.\r\n    Orbital speed of companion,          55.4   \"    \"   \"\r\n    Mass of Algol,                        4/9 mass of our Sun.\r\n    Mass of companion,                    2/9  \"     \"     \"\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that these figures relate to a pair of stars only one\r\nof which has ever been seen, that the orbital motion even of the visible\r\nstar cannot be detected in the most powerful telescopes, when, further, we\r\ntake into account the enormous distance of these objects from us, the great\r\nresults of spectroscopic observation will be better appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut besides the marvel of such a discovery by such simple means, the facts\r\ndiscovered are themselves in the highest degree marvellous. All that we had\r\nknown of the stars through telescopic observation indicated that they were\r\nat very great distances from each other however thickly they may appear\r\nscattered over the sky. This is the case even with close telescopic double\r\nstars, owing to their enormous remoteness from us. It is now estimated that\r\neven stars of the first magnitude are, on a general average, about eighty\r\nmillions of millions of miles distant; while the closest double stars that\r\ncan be distinctly separated by large telescopes are about half a second\r\napart. These, if at the above distance, will be about 1500 millions of\r\nmiles from each other. But in the case of Algol and its companion, we have\r\ntwo bodies both larger than our sun, yet with a distance of only 2-1/4\r\nmillions of miles between their surfaces, a distance not much exceeding\r\ntheir combined diameters. We should not have anticipated that such huge\r\nbodies could revolve so closely to each other, and as we now know that the\r\nneighbourhood of our sun--and probably of all suns--is full of meteoric and\r\ncometic matter, it would seem probable that in the case of two suns so near\r\ntogether the quantity of such matter would be very great, and would lead\r\nprobably by continued collisions to increase of their bulk, and perhaps to\r\ntheir final coalescence into a single giant orb. It is said that a Persian\r\nastronomer in the tenth century calls Algol a red star, while it is now\r\nwhite or somewhat yellowish. This would imply an increase of temperature\r\ncaused by collisions or friction, and increasing proximity of the pair of\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of double stars with dark companions have been\r\ndiscovered by means of the spectroscope, although their motion is not\r\ndirectly in the line of sight, and therefore there is no obscuration. In\r\norder to discover such pairs the spectra of large numbers of stars are\r\ntaken on photographic plates every night and for considerable periods--for\r\na year or for several years. These plates are then carefully examined with\r\na high magnifying power to discover any periodical displacement of the\r\nlines, and it is astonishing in how large a number of cases this has been\r\nfound to exist and the period of revolution of the pair determined.\r\n\r\nBut besides discovering double stars of which one is dark and one bright,\r\nmany pairs of bright stars have been discovered by the same means. The\r\nmethod in this case is rather different. Each component star, being\r\nluminous, will give a separate spectrum, and the best spectroscopes are so\r\npowerful that they will separate these spectra when the stars are at their\r\nmaximum distance although no telescope in existence, or ever likely to be\r\nmade, can separate the component stars. The separation of the spectra is\r\nusually shown by the most prominent lines becoming double and then after a\r\ntime single, indicating that the plane of revolution is more or less\r\nobliquely towards us, so that the two stars if visible would appear to open\r\nout and then get nearer together every revolution. Then, as each star\r\nalternately approaches and recedes from us the radial velocity of each can\r\nbe determined, and this gives the relative mass. In this way not only\r\ndoubles, but triple and multiple systems, have been discovered. The stars\r\nproved to be double by these two methods are so numerous that it has been\r\nestimated by one of the best observers that about one star in every\r\nthirteen shows inequality in its radial motion and is therefore really a\r\ndouble star.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULÆ\r\n\r\nOne other great result of spectrum-analysis, and in some respects perhaps\r\nthe greatest, is its demonstration of the fact that true nebulæ exist, and\r\nthat they are not all star-clusters so remote as to be irresolvable, as was\r\nonce supposed. They are shown to have gaseous spectra, or sometimes gaseous\r\nand stellar spectra combined, and this, in connection with the fact that\r\nnebulæ are frequently aggregated around nebulous stars or groups of stars,\r\nrenders it certain that the nebulæ are in no way separated in space from\r\nthe stars, but that they constitute essential parts of one vast stellar\r\nuniverse. There is, indeed, good reason to believe that they are really the\r\nmaterial out of which stars are made, and that in their forms,\r\naggregations, and condensations, we can trace the very process of evolution\r\nof stars and suns.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another powerful engine of research which the new\r\nastronomy possesses, and which, either alone or in combination with the\r\nspectroscope, had produced and will yet produce in the future an amount of\r\nknowledge of the stellar universe which could never be attained by any\r\nother means. It has already been stated how the discovery of new variable\r\nand binary stars has been rendered possible by the preservation of the\r\nphotographic plates on which the spectra are self-recorded, night after\r\nnight, with every line, whether dark or coloured, in true position, so as\r\nto bear magnification, and, by comparison with others of the series,\r\nenabling the most minute changes to be detected and their amount accurately\r\nmeasured. Without the preservation of such comparable records, which is in\r\nno other way possible, by far the larger portion of spectroscopic\r\ndiscoveries could never have been made.\r\n\r\nBut there are two other uses of photography of quite a different nature\r\nwhich are equally and perhaps in their final outcome may be far more\r\nimportant. The first is, that by the use of the photographic plate the\r\nexact positions of scores, hundreds, or even thousands of stars can be\r\nself-mapped simultaneously with extreme accuracy, while any number of\r\ncopies can be made of these star-maps. This entirely obviates the necessity\r\nfor the old method of fixing the position of each star by repeated\r\nmeasurement by means of very elaborate instruments, and their registration\r\nin laborious and expensive catalogues. So important is this now seen to be,\r\nthat specially constructed cameras are made for stellar photography, and by\r\nmeans of the best kinds of equatorial mounting are made to revolve slowly\r\nso that the image of each star remains stationary upon the plate for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nArrangements have been now made among all the chief observatories of the\r\nworld to carry out a photographic survey of the heavens with identical\r\ninstruments, so as to produce maps of the whole star-system on the same\r\nscale. These will serve as fixed data for future astronomers, who will thus\r\nbe able to determine the movements of stars of all magnitudes with a\r\ncertainty and accuracy hitherto unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe other important use of photography depends upon the fact that with a\r\nlonger exposure within certain limits we increase the light-collecting\r\npower. It will surprise many persons to learn that an ordinary good\r\nportrait-camera with a lens three or four inches in diameter, if properly\r\nmounted so that an exposure of several hours can be made, will show stars\r\nso minute that they are invisible even in the great Lick telescope. In this\r\nway the camera will often reveal double-stars or small groups which can be\r\nmade visible in no other way.\r\n\r\nSuch photographs of the stars are now constantly reproduced in works on\r\nAstronomy and in popular magazine articles, and although some of them are\r\nvery striking, many persons are disappointed with them, and cannot\r\nunderstand their great value, because each star is represented by a white\r\ncircle often of considerable size and with a somewhat undefined outline,\r\nnot by a minute point of light as stars appear in a good telescope. But the\r\nessential matter in all such photographs is not so much the smallness, as\r\nthe roundness, of the star-images, as this proves the extreme precision\r\nwith which the image of every star has been kept by the clockwork motion of\r\nthe instrument on the same point of the plate during the whole exposure.\r\nFor example, in the fine photograph of the Great Nebula in Andromeda, taken\r\n29th December 1888, by Dr. Isaac Roberts, with an exposure of four hours,\r\nthere are probably over a thousand stars large and small to be seen, every\r\none represented by an almost exactly circular white dot of a size dependent\r\non the magnitude of the star. These round dots can be bisected by the cross\r\nhairs of a micrometer with very great accuracy, and thus the distance\r\nbetween the centres of any of the pairs, as well as the direction of the\r\nline joining their centres, can be determined as accurately as if each was\r\nrepresented by a point only. But as a minute white speck would be almost\r\ninvisible on the maps, and would convey no information as to the\r\napproximate magnitude of the star, mistakes would be much more easily made,\r\nand it would probably be found necessary to surround each star with a\r\ncircle to indicate its magnitude, and to enable it to be easily seen. It is\r\nprobable, therefore, that the supposed defect is really an important\r\nadvantage. The above-mentioned photograph is beautifully reproduced in\r\nProctor's _Old and New Astronomy_, published after his greatly lamented\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut besides the amount of altogether new knowledge obtained by the methods\r\nof research here briefly explained, a great deal of light has been thrown\r\non the distribution of the stars as a whole, and hence on the nature and\r\nextent of the stellar universe, by a careful study of the materials\r\nobtained by the old methods, and by the application of the doctrine of\r\nprobabilities to the observed facts. In this way alone some very striking\r\nresults have been reached, and these have been supported and strengthened\r\nby the newer methods, and also by the use of new instruments in the\r\nmeasurement of stellar distances. Some of these results bear so closely and\r\ndirectly upon the special subject of the present volume, that our next\r\nchapter must be devoted to a consideration of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look at the heavens on a clear, moonless night in winter, and from a\r\nposition embracing the entire horizon, the scene is an inexpressibly grand\r\none. The intense sparkling brilliancy of Sirius, Capella, Vega, and other\r\nstars of the first magnitude; their striking arrangement in constellations\r\nor groups, of which Orion, the Great Bear, Cassiopeiæ, and the Pleiades,\r\nare familiar examples; and the filling up between these by less and less\r\nbrilliant points down to the limit of vision, so as to cover the whole sky\r\nwith a scintillating tracery of minute points of light, convey together an\r\nidea of such confused scattering and such enormous numbers, that it seems\r\nimpossible to count them or to reduce them to systematic order. Yet this\r\nwas done for all except the faintest stars by Hipparchus, 134 B.C., who\r\ncatalogued and fixed the positions of more than 1000 stars, and this is\r\nabout the number, down to the fifth magnitude, visible in the latitude of\r\nGreece. A recent enumeration of all the stars visible to the naked eye,\r\nunder the most favourable conditions and by the best eyesight, has been\r\nmade by the American astronomer, Pickering. His numbers are--for the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere 2509, and for the Southern Hemisphere 2824, thus\r\nshowing a somewhat greater richness in the southern celestial hemisphere.\r\nBut as this difference is due entirely to a preponderance of stars between\r\nmagnitudes 5-1/2 and 6, that is, just on the limits of vision, while those\r\ndown to magnitude 5-1/2 are more numerous by 85 in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nProfessor Newcomb is of opinion that there is no real superiority of\r\nnumbers of visible stars in one hemisphere over the other. Again, the total\r\nnumber of the visible stars by the above enumeration is 5333. But this\r\nincludes stars down to 6.2 magnitude, while it is generally considered that\r\nmagnitude 6 marks the limit of visibility. On a re-examination of all the\r\nmaterials, the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli concludes that the total\r\nnumber of stars down to the sixth magnitude is 4303; and they seem to be\r\nabout equally divided between the northern and southern skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\nBut besides the stars themselves, a most conspicuous object both in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemisphere is that wonderful irregular belt of\r\nfaintly diffused light termed the Milky Way or Galaxy. This forms a\r\nmagnificent arch across the sky, best seen in the autumn months in our\r\nlatitude. This arch, while following the general course of a great circle\r\nround the heavens, is extremely irregular in detail, sometimes being\r\nsingle, sometimes double, sending off occasional branches or offshoots, and\r\nalso containing in its very midst dark rifts, spots, or patches, where the\r\nblack background of almost starless sky can be seen through it. When\r\nexamined through an opera-glass or small telescope quantities of stars are\r\nseen on the luminous background, and with every increase in the size and\r\npower of the telescope more and more stars become visible, till with the\r\nlargest and best modern instruments the whole of the Galaxy seems densely\r\npacked with them, though still full of irregularities, wavy streams of\r\nstars, and dark rifts and patches, but always showing a faint nebulous\r\nbackground as if there remained other myriads of stars which a still higher\r\noptical power would reveal.\r\n\r\nThe relations of this great belt of telescopic stars to the rest of the\r\nstar-system have long interested astronomers, and many have attempted its\r\nsolution. By a system of gauging, that is counting all the stars that\r\npassed over the field of his telescope in a certain time, Sir William\r\nHerschel was the first who made a systematic effort to determine the shape\r\nof the stellar universe. From the fact that the number of stars increased\r\nrapidly as the Milky Way was approached from whatever direction, while in\r\nthe Galaxy itself the numbers visible were at once more than doubled, he\r\nformed the idea that the shape of the entire system must be that of a\r\nhighly compressed very broad mass or ring rather less dense towards the\r\ncentre where our sun was situated. Roughly speaking, the form was likened\r\nto a flat disc or grindstone, but of irregular thickness, and split in two\r\non one side where it appears to be double. The immense quantity of the\r\nstars which formed it was supposed to be due to the fact that we looked at\r\nit edgewise through an immense depth of stars; while at right angles to its\r\ndirection when looking towards what is termed the pole of the Galaxy, and\r\nalso in a less degree when looking obliquely, we see out into space through\r\na much thinner stratum of stars, which thus seem on the average to be very\r\nmuch farther apart.\r\n\r\nBut, in the latter part of his life, Sir William Herschel realised that\r\nthis was not the true explanation of the features presented by the Galaxy.\r\nThe brilliant spots and patches in it, the dark rifts and openings, the\r\nnarrow streams of light often bounded by equally narrow streams or rifts of\r\ndarkness, render it quite impossible to conceive that this complex luminous\r\nring has the form of a compressed disc extending in the direction in which\r\nwe see it to a distance many times greater than its thickness. In one very\r\nluminous cluster Herschel thought that his telescope had penetrated to\r\nregions twenty times as far off as the more brilliant stars forming the\r\nnearer portions of the same object. Now, in the case of the Magellanic\r\nclouds, which are two roundish nebular patches of large size some distance\r\nfrom the Milky Way in the Southern Hemisphere and looking like detached\r\nportions of it, Sir John Herschel himself has shown that any such\r\ninterpretation of its form is impossible; because it requires us to suppose\r\nthat in both these cases we see, not rounded masses of a roughly globular\r\nshape, but immensely long cones or cylinders, placed in such a direction\r\nthat we see only the ends of them. He remarks that one such object so\r\nsituated would be an extraordinary coincidence, but that there should be\r\ntwo or many such is altogether out of the question. But in the Milky Way\r\nthere are hundreds or even thousands of such spots or masses of\r\nexceptional brilliancy or exceptional darkness; and, if the form of the\r\nGalaxy is that of a disc many times broader than thick, and which we see\r\nedgewise, then every one of these patches and clusters, and all the narrow\r\nwinding streams of bright light or intense blackness, must be really\r\nexcessively long cylinders, or tunnels, or deep curving laminæ, or narrow\r\nfissures. And every one of these, which are to be found in every part of\r\nthis vast circle of luminosity, must be so arranged as to be exactly turned\r\ntowards our sun. The weight of this argument, which has been most forcibly\r\nand clearly set forth by the late Mr. R.A. Proctor, in his very instructive\r\nvolume _Our Place among Infinities_, is now generally admitted by\r\nastronomers, and the natural conclusion is that the form of the Milky Way\r\nis that of a vast irregular ring, of which the section at any part is,\r\nroughly speaking, circular; while the many narrow rifts or lanes or\r\nopenings where we seem to be able to see completely through it to the\r\ndarkness of outer space beyond, render it probable that in those directions\r\nits thickness is less instead of greater than its apparent width, that is,\r\nthat we see the broader side rather than the narrow edge of it.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the consideration of the relations which the bulk of the\r\nstars we see scattered over the entire vault of heaven bear to this great\r\nbelt of telescopic stars, it will be advisable to give a somewhat full\r\ndescription of the Galaxy itself, both because it is not often delineated\r\non star-maps with sufficient accuracy, or so as to show its wonderful\r\nintricacies of structure, and also because it constitutes the fundamental\r\nphenomenon upon which the argument set forth in this volume primarily\r\nrests. For this purpose I shall use the description of it given by Sir John\r\nHerschel in his _Outlines of Astronomy_, both because he, of all the\r\nastronomers of the last century, had studied it most thoroughly, in the\r\nnorthern and in the southern hemispheres, by eye-observation and with the\r\naid of telescopes of great power and admirable quality; and also because,\r\namid the throng of modern works and the exciting novelties of the last\r\nthirty years, his instructive volume is, comparatively speaking, very\r\nlittle known. This precise and careful description will also be of service\r\nto any of my readers who may wish to form a closer personal acquaintance\r\nwith this magnificent and intensely interesting object, by examining its\r\npeculiarities of form and beauties of structure either with the naked eye,\r\nor with the aid of a good opera-glass, or with a small telescope of good\r\ndefining power.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel's description is as follows:--'The course of the Milky\r\nWay as traced through the heavens by the unaided eye, neglecting occasional\r\ndeviations and following the line of its greatest brightness as well as its\r\nvarying breadth and intensity will permit, conforms, as nearly as the\r\nindefiniteness of its boundary will allow it to be fixed, to that of a\r\ngreat circle inclined at an angle of about 63° to the equinoctial, and\r\ncutting that circle in Right Ascension 6h. 47m. and 18h. 47m., so that its\r\nnorthern and southern poles respectively are situated in Right Ascension\r\n12h. 47m., North Polar Distance 63°, and R.A. 0h. 47m., NPD. 117°.\r\nThroughout the region where it is so remarkably subdivided, this great\r\ncircle holds an intermediate situation between the two great streams; with\r\na nearer approximation however to the brighter and continuous stream than\r\nto the fainter and interrupted one. If we trace its course in order of\r\nright ascension, we find it traversing the constellation Cassiopeiæ, its\r\nbrightest part passing about two degrees to the north of the star Delta of\r\nthat constellation. Passing thence between Gamma and Epsilon Cassiopeiæ, it\r\nsends off a branch to the south-preceding side, towards Alpha Persei, very\r\nconspicuous as far as that star, prolonged faintly towards Eta of the same\r\nconstellation, and possibly traceable towards the Hyades and Pleiades as\r\nremote outliers. The main stream, however (which is here very faint),\r\npasses on through Auriga, over the three remarkable stars, Epsilon, Zeta,\r\nEta, of that constellation called the Hædi, preceding Capella, between the\r\nfeet of Gemini and the horns of the Bull (where it intersects the ecliptic\r\nnearly in the Solstitial Colure) and thence over the club of Orion to the\r\nneck of Monoceros, intersecting the equinoctial in R.A. 6h. 54m. Up to this\r\npoint, from the offset in Perseus, its light is feeble and indefinite, but\r\nthenceforward it receives a gradual accession of brightness, and where it\r\npasses through the shoulder of Monoceros and over the head of Canis Major\r\nit presents a broad, moderately bright, very uniform, and to the naked eye,\r\nstarless stream up to the point where it enters the prow of the ship Argo,\r\nnearly on the southern tropic. Here it again subdivides (about the star _m_\r\nPuppis), sending off a narrow and winding branch on the preceding side as\r\nfar as Gamma Argûs, where it terminates abruptly. The main stream pursues\r\nits southward course to the 123rd parallel of NPD., where it diffuses\r\nitself broadly and again subdivides, opening out into a wide fan-like\r\nexpanse, nearly 20° in breadth, formed of interlacing branches, which all\r\nterminate abruptly, in a line drawn nearly through Lambda and Gamma Argûs.\r\n\r\n'At this place the continuity of the Milky Way is interrupted by a wide\r\ngap, and where it recommences on the opposite side it is by a somewhat\r\nsimilar fan-shaped assemblage of branches which converge upon the bright\r\nstar Eta Argûs. Thence it crosses the hind feet of the Centaur, forming a\r\ncurious and sharply-defined semicircular concavity of small radius, and\r\nenters the Cross by a very bright neck or isthmus of not more than three or\r\nfour degrees in breadth, being the narrowest portion of the Milky Way.\r\nAfter this it immediately expands into a broad and bright mass, enclosing\r\nthe stars Alpha and Beta Crucis and Beta Centauri, and extending almost up\r\nto Alpha of the latter constellation. In the midst of this bright mass,\r\nsurrounded by it on all sides, and occupying about half its breadth, occurs\r\na singular dark pear-shaped vacancy, so conspicuous and remarkable as to\r\nattract the notice of the most superficial gazer and to have acquired among\r\nthe early southern navigators the uncouth but expressive appellation of the\r\n_coal-sack_. In this vacancy, which is about 8° in length and 5° broad,\r\nonly one very small star visible to the naked eye occurs, though it is far\r\nfrom devoid of telescopic stars, so that its striking blackness is simply\r\ndue to the effect of contrast with the brilliant ground with which it is on\r\nall sides surrounded. This is the place of nearest approach of the Milky\r\nWay to the South Pole. Throughout all this region its brightness is very\r\nstriking, and when compared with that of its more northern course already\r\ntraced, conveys strongly the impression of greater proximity, and would\r\nalmost lead to a belief that our situation as spectators is separated on\r\nall sides by a considerable interval from the dense body of stars composing\r\nthe Galaxy, which in this view of the subject would come to be considered\r\nas a flat ring or some other re-entering form of immense and irregular\r\nbreadth and thickness, within which we are excentrically situated, nearer\r\nto the southern than to the northern part of its circuit.\r\n\r\n'At Alpha Centauri the Milky Way again subdivides, sending off a great\r\nbranch of nearly half its breadth, but which thins off rapidly, at an angle\r\nof about 20° with its general direction to Eta and _d_ Lupi, beyond which\r\nit loses itself in a narrow and faint streamlet. The main stream passes on\r\nincreasing in breadth to Gamma Normæ, where it makes an abrupt elbow and\r\nagain subdivides into one principal and continuous stream of very irregular\r\nbreadth and brightness, and a complicated system of interlaced streaks and\r\nmasses, which covers the tail of Scorpio, and terminates in a vast and\r\nfaint effusion over the whole extensive region occupied by the preceding\r\nleg of Ophiuchus, extending northward to the parallel of 103° NPD., beyond\r\nwhich it cannot be traced; a wide interval of 14°, free from all appearance\r\nof nebulous light, separating it from the great branch on the north side\r\nof the equinoctial of which it is usually represented as a continuation.\r\n\r\n'Returning to the point of separation of this great branch from the main\r\nstream, let us now pursue the course of the latter. Making an abrupt bend\r\nto the following side, it passes over the stars Iota Aræ, Theta and Iota\r\nScorpii, and Gamma Tubi to Gamma Sagittarii, where it suddenly collects\r\ninto a vivid oval mass about 6° in length and 4° in breadth, so excessively\r\nrich in stars that a very moderate calculation makes their number exceed\r\n100,000. Northward of this mass, this stream crosses the ecliptic in\r\nlongitude about 276°, and proceeding along the bow of Sagittarius into\r\nAntinous has its course rippled by three deep concavities, separated from\r\neach other by remarkable protuberances, of which the larger and brighter\r\nforms the most conspicuous patch in the southern portion of the Milky Way\r\nvisible in our latitudes.\r\n\r\n'Crossing the equinoctial at the 19th hour of R.A., it next runs in an\r\nirregular, patchy, and winding stream through Aquila, Sagitta, and\r\nVulpecula up to Cygnus; at Epsilon of which constellation its continuity is\r\ninterrupted, and a very confused and irregular region commences, marked by\r\na broad dark vacuity, not unlike the southern \"coal-sack,\" occupying the\r\nspace between Epsilon, Alpha, and Gamma Cygni, which serves as a kind of\r\ncentre for the divergence of three great streams; one, which we have\r\nalready traced; a second, the continuation of the first (across the\r\ninterval) from Alpha northward, between Lacerta and the head of Cepheus to\r\nthe point in Cassiopeiæ whence we set out, and a third branching off from\r\nGamma Cygni, very vivid and conspicuous, running off in a southern\r\ndirection through Beta Cygni, and _s_ Aquilæ almost to the equinoctial,\r\nwhere it loses itself in a region thinly sprinkled with stars, where in\r\nsome maps the modern constellation Taurus Poniatowski is placed. This is\r\nthe branch which, if continued across the equinoctial, might be supposed to\r\nunite with the great southern effusion in Ophiuchus already noticed. A\r\nconsiderable offset, or protuberant appendage, is also thrown off by the\r\nnorthern stream from the head of Cepheus directly towards the pole,\r\noccupying the greater part of the quartile formed by Alpha, Beta, Iota, and\r\nDelta of that constellation.'\r\n\r\nTo complete this careful, detailed description of the Milky Way, it will be\r\nwell to add a few passages from the same work as to its telescopic\r\nappearance and structure.\r\n\r\n'When examined with powerful telescopes, the constitution of this wonderful\r\nzone is found to be no less various than its aspect to the naked eye is\r\nirregular. In some regions the stars of which it is composed are scattered\r\nwith remarkable uniformity over immense tracts, while in others the\r\nirregularity of their distribution is quite as striking, exhibiting a rapid\r\nsuccession of closely clustering rich patches separated by comparatively\r\npoor intervals, and indeed in some instances by spaces absolutely dark _and\r\ncompletely void of any star_, even of the smallest telescopic magnitude. In\r\nsome places not more than 40 or 50 stars on an average occur in a\r\ngauge-field of 15', while in others a similar average gives a result of 400\r\nor 500. Nor is less variety observable in the character of its different\r\nregions in respect of the magnitudes of the stars they exhibit, and the\r\nproportional numbers of the larger and smaller magnitudes associated\r\ntogether, than in respect of their aggregate numbers. In some, for\r\ninstance, extremely minute stars occur in numbers so moderate as to lead us\r\nirresistibly to the conclusion that in these regions we see _fairly\r\nthrough_ the starry stratum, since it is impossible otherwise that the\r\nnumbers of the smaller magnitudes should not go on continually increasing\r\nad infinitum. In such cases, moreover, the ground of the heavens is for the\r\nmost part perfectly dark, which again would not be the case if innumerable\r\nmultitudes of stars, too minute to be individually discernible, existed\r\nbeyond. In other regions we are presented with the phænomenon of an almost\r\nuniform degree of brightness of the individual stars, accompanied with a\r\nvery even distribution of them over the ground of the heavens, both the\r\nlarger and smaller magnitudes being strikingly deficient. In such cases it\r\nis equally impossible not to perceive that we are looking _through_ a sheet\r\nof stars nearly of a size, and of no great thickness compared with the\r\ndistance which separates them from us. Were it otherwise we should be\r\ndriven to suppose the more distant stars uniformly the larger, so as to\r\ncompensate by their greater intrinsic brightness for their greater\r\ndistance, a supposition contrary to all probability....\r\n\r\n'Throughout by far the larger portion of the extent of the Milky Way in\r\nboth hemispheres, the general blackness of the ground of the heavens on\r\nwhich its stars are projected, and the absence of that innumerable\r\nmultitude and excessive crowding of the smallest visible magnitudes, and of\r\nglare produced by the aggregate light of multitudes too small to affect the\r\neye singly, must, we think, be considered unequivocal indications that its\r\ndimensions in _directions where these conditions obtain_ are not only not\r\ninfinite, but that the space-penetrating power of our telescopes suffices\r\nfairly to pierce through and beyond it.'\r\n\r\nIn the above-quoted passage the italics are those of Sir John Herschel\r\nhimself, and we see that he drew the very same conclusions from the facts\r\nhe describes, and for much the same reasons, as Mr. Proctor has drawn from\r\nthe observations of Sir William Herschel; and, as we shall see, the best\r\nastronomers to-day have arrived at a similar result, from the additional\r\nfacts at their disposal, and in some cases from fresh lines of argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STARS IN RELATION TO THE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel was so impressed with the form, structure, and immensity\r\nof the Galactic Circle, as he sometimes terms it, that he says (in a\r\nfootnote p. 575, 10th ed.), 'This circle is to sidereal what the invariable\r\necliptic is to planetary astronomy--a plane of ultimate reference, the\r\nground-plane of the sidereal system.' We have now to consider what are the\r\nrelations of the whole body of the stars to this Galactic Circle--this\r\nplane of ultimate reference for the whole stellar universe.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the heavens on a starry night, the whole vault appears to be\r\nthickly strewn with stars of various degrees of brightness, so that we\r\ncould hardly say that any extensive region--the north, east, south, or\r\nwest, or the portion vertically above us--is very conspicuously deficient\r\nor superior in numbers. In every part there are to be found a fair\r\nproportion of stars of the first two or three magnitudes, while where these\r\nmay seem deficient a crowd of smaller stars takes their place.\r\n\r\nBut an accurate survey of the visible stars shows that there is a large\r\namount of irregularity in their distribution, and that all magnitudes are\r\nreally more numerous in or near the Milky Way, than at a distance from it,\r\nthough not in so large a degree as to be very conspicuous to the naked eye.\r\nThe area of the whole of the Milky Way cannot be estimated at more than\r\none-seventh of the whole sphere, while some astronomers reckon it at only\r\none-tenth. If stars of any particular size were uniformly distributed, at\r\nmost one-seventh of the whole number should be found within its limits. But\r\nMr. Gore finds that of 32 stars brighter than the second magnitude 12 lie\r\nupon the Milky Way, or considerably more than twice as many as there should\r\nbe if they were uniformly distributed. And in the case of the 99 stars\r\nwhich are brighter than the third magnitude 33 lie upon the Milky Way, or\r\none-third instead of one-seventh. Mr. Gore also counted all the stars in\r\nHeis's Atlas which lie upon the Milky Way, and finds there are 1186 out of\r\na total of 5356, a proportion of between a fourth and a fifth instead of a\r\nseventh.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Proctor in 1871 laid down on a chart two feet diameter all the\r\nstars down to magnitude 9-1/2 given in Agrelander's forty large charts of\r\nthe stars visible in the northern hemisphere. They were 324,198 in number,\r\nand they distinctly showed by their greater density not only the whole\r\ncourse of the Milky Way but also its more luminous portions and many of the\r\ncurious dark rifts and vacuities, which latter are almost wholly avoided by\r\nthese stars.\r\n\r\nLater on Professor Seeliger of Munich made an investigation of the relation\r\nof more than 135,000 stars down to the ninth magnitude to the Milky Way, by\r\ndividing the whole of the heavens into nine regions, one and nine being\r\ncircles of 20° wide (equal to 40° diameter) at the two poles of the Galaxy;\r\nthe middle region, five, is a zone 20° wide including the Milky Way itself,\r\nand the other six intermediate zones are each 20° wide. The following table\r\nshows the results as given by Professor Newcomb, who has made some\r\nalterations in the last column of 'Density of Stars' in order to correct\r\ndifferences in the estimate of magnitudes by the different authorities.\r\n\r\n    Regions.

IF THE LATTER WERE\r\nA SIMPLE RING OF STARS SURROUNDING A SPHERICAL SYSTEM OF STARS, THE\r\nSTAR-DENSITY WOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME IN REGIONS I., II., and III., and also\r\nin VII., VIII., and IX., but would suddenly increase in IV. and VI. as the\r\nboundary of the ring was approached. Instead of such being the case, the\r\nnumbers 2.78, 3.03, and 3.54 in the north, and 3.14, 3.21, and 3.71 in the\r\nsouth, show a progressive increase from the galactic pole to the Galaxy\r\nitself. The conclusion to be drawn is a fundamental one. The universe, or\r\nat least the denser portion of it, is really flattened between the galactic\r\npoles, as supposed by Herschel and Struve.'\r\n\r\nBut looking at the series of figures in the table, and again as quoted by\r\nProfessor Newcomb, they seem to me to show in some measure what he says\r\nthey do not show. I therefore drew out the above diagram from the figures\r\nin the table, and it certainly shows that the density in regions I., II.,\r\nand III., and in regions VII., VIII., and IX., may be said to be 'about the\r\nsame,' that is, they increase very slowly, and that they _do_ 'suddenly\r\nincrease' in IV. and VI. as the boundary of the Galaxy is approached. This\r\nmay be explained either by a flattening towards the poles of the Galaxy, or\r\nby the thinning out of stars in that direction.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the enormous difference of star-density in the Galaxy and\r\nat the galactic poles, Professor Newcomb gives the following table of the\r\nHerschelian gauges, on which he only remarks that they show an enormously\r\nincreased density in the galactic region due to the Herschels having\r\ncounted so many more stars there than any other observers.\r\n\r\n    +-----------+----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n    |Region,   .| I. | II.|III.| IV.|  V. | VI. | VII.|VIII.| IX. |\r\n    |           |    |    |    |    |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n    |Density,  .|107 |154 |281 |560 |2,019| 672 | 261 | 154 | 111 |\r\n    +-----------+----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF STAR-DENSITY From a table in _The Stars_ (p.\r\n249).]\r\n\r\nBut an important characteristic of these figures is, that the Herschels\r\nalone surveyed the whole of the heavens from the north to the south pole,\r\nthat they did this with instruments of the same size and quality, and that\r\nfrom almost life-long experience in this particular work they were\r\nunrivalled in their power of counting rapidly and accurately the stars that\r\npassed over each field of view of their telescopes. Their results,\r\ntherefore, must be held to have a comparative value far above those of any\r\nother observer or combination of observers. I have therefore thought it\r\nadvisable to draw a diagram from their figures, and it will be seen how\r\nstrikingly it agrees with the former diagram in the very slow increase of\r\nstar-richness in the first three regions north and south, the sudden\r\nincrease in regions IV. and VI. as we approach the Galaxy, while the only\r\nmarked difference is in the enormously greater richness of the Galaxy\r\nitself, which is an undoubtedly real phenomenon, and is brought out here by\r\nthe unrivalled observing power of the two greatest astronomers in this\r\nspecial department that have ever lived.\r\n\r\nWe shall find later on that Professor Newcomb himself, as the result of a\r\nquite different inquiry arrives at a result in accordance with these\r\ndiagrams which will then be again referred to. As this is a very\r\ninteresting subject, it will be well to give another diagram from two\r\ntables of star-density in Sir John Herschel's volume already quoted. The\r\ntables are as follows:--\r\n\r\n      Zones of Galactic         Average number of Star\r\n    North Polar Distance.         per Field of 15'.\r\n\r\n         0° to 15°                       4.32\r\n        15° to 30°                       5.42\r\n        30° to 45°                       8.21\r\n        45° to 60°                      13.61\r\n        60° to 75°                      24.09\r\n        75° to 90°                      53.43\r\n\r\n      Zones of Galactic          Average number of Stars\r\n    South Polar Distance.        per Field of 15'.\r\n\r\n         0° to 15°                      6.05\r\n        15° to 30°                      6.62\r\n        30° to 45°                      9.08\r\n        45° to 60°                     13.49\r\n        60° to 75°                     26.29\r\n        75° to 90°                     59.06\r\n\r\nIn these tables the Milky Way itself is taken as occupying two zones of 15°\r\neach, instead of one of 20° as in Professor Newcomb's tables, so that the\r\nexcess in the number of stars over the other zones is not so large. They\r\nshow also a slight preponderance in all the zones of the southern\r\nhemisphere, but this is not great, and may probably be due to the clearer\r\natmosphere of the Cape of Good Hope as compared with that of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF STAR-DENSITY. From Table in Sir J. Herschel's\r\n_Outlines of Astronomy_ (10th ed., pp. 577-578).]\r\n\r\nIt need only be noted here that this diagram shows the same general\r\nfeatures as those already given, of a continuous increase of star-density\r\nfrom the poles of the Galaxy, but more rapidly as the Galaxy itself is\r\nmore nearly approached. This fact must, therefore, be accepted as\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUSTERS AND NEBULÆ IN RELATION TO THE GALAXY\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the structure of the heavens is afforded by the\r\ndistribution of the two classes of objects known as clusters and nebulæ.\r\nAlthough we can form an almost continuous series from double stars which\r\nrevolve round their common centre of gravity, through triple and quadruple\r\nstars, to groups and aggregations of indefinite extent--of which the\r\nPleiades form a good example, since the six stars visible to the naked eye\r\nare increased to hundreds by high telescopic powers, while photographs with\r\nthree hours' exposure show more than 2000 stars--yet none of these\r\ncorrespond to the large class known as clusters, whether globular or\r\nirregular, which are very numerous, about 600 having been recorded by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel more than fifty years ago. Many of these are among the most\r\nbeautiful and striking objects in the heavens even with a very small\r\ntelescope or good opera-glass. Such is the luminous spot called Praesepe,\r\nor the Beehive in the constellation Cancer, and another in the sword handle\r\nof Perseus.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere there is a hazy star of about the fourth\r\nmagnitude, Omega Centauri, which with a good telescope is seen to be really\r\na magnificent cluster nearly two-thirds the diameter of the moon, and\r\ndescribed by Sir John Herschel as very gradually increasing in brightness\r\nto the centre, and composed of innumerable stars of the thirteenth and\r\nfifteenth magnitudes, forming the richest and largest object of the kind in\r\nthe heavens. He describes it as having rings like lace-work formed of the\r\nlarger stars. By actual count, on a good photograph, there are more than\r\n6000 stars, while other observers consider that there are at least 10,000.\r\nIn the northern hemisphere one of the finest is that in the constellation\r\nHercules, known as 13 Messier. It is just visible to the naked eye or with\r\nan opera glass as a hazy star of the sixth magnitude, but a good telescope\r\nshows it to be a globular cluster, and the great Lick telescope resolves\r\neven the densest central portion into distinct stars, of which Sir John\r\nHerschel considered there were many thousands. These two fine clusters are\r\nfigured in many of the modern popular works on astronomy, and they afford\r\nan excellent idea of these beautiful and remarkable objects, which, when\r\nmore thoroughly studied, will probably aid in elucidating some of the\r\nobscure problems connected with the constitution and development of the\r\nstellar universe.\r\n\r\nBut for the purpose of the present work the most interesting fact connected\r\nwith star-clusters is their remarkable distribution in the heavens. Their\r\nspecial abundance in and near the Milky Way had often been noted, but the\r\nfull importance of the fact could not be appreciated till Mr. Proctor and,\r\nlater, Mr. Sidney Waters marked down, on maps of the two hemispheres, all\r\nthe star-clusters and nebulæ in the best catalogues. The result is most\r\ninteresting. The clusters are seen to be thickly strewn over the entire\r\ncourse of the Milky Way, and along its margins, while in every other part\r\nof the heavens they are thinly scattered at very distant intervals, with\r\nthe one exception of the Magellanic clouds of the southern hemisphere where\r\nthey are again densely grouped; and if anything were needed to prove the\r\nphysical connection of these clusters with the Galaxy it would be their\r\noccurrence in these extensive nebulous patches which seem like outlying\r\nportions of the Milky Way itself. With these two exceptions probably not\r\none-twentieth part of the whole number of star-clusters are found in any\r\npart of the heavens remote from the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nNebulæ were for a long time confounded with star-clusters, because it was\r\nthought that with sufficient telescopic power they could all be resolvable\r\ninto stars as in the case of the Milky Way itself. But when the\r\nspectroscope showed that many of the nebulæ consisted wholly or mainly of\r\nglowing gases, while neither the highest powers of the best telescopes nor\r\nthe still greater powers of the photographic plate gave any indications of\r\nresolvability, although a few stars were often found to be, as it were,\r\nentangled in them, and evidently forming part of them, it was seen that\r\nthey constituted a distinct stellar phenomenon, a view which was enforced\r\nand rendered certain by their quite unique mode of distribution. A few of\r\nthe larger and irregular type, as in the case of the grand Orion nebula\r\nvisible to the naked eye, the great spiral nebula in Andromeda, and the\r\nwonderful Keyhole nebula round Eta Argûs, are situated in or near the Milky\r\nWay; but with these and a few other exceptions the overwhelming majority of\r\nthe smaller irresolvable nebulæ appear to avoid it, there being a space\r\nalmost wholly free from nebulæ along its borders, both in the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres; while the great majority are spread over the sky, far\r\naway from it in the southern hemisphere, and in the north clustering in a\r\nvery marked degree around the galactic pole. The distribution of nebulæ is\r\nthus seen to be the exact opposite to that of the star-clusters, while both\r\nare so distinctly related to the position of the Milky Way--the\r\nground-plane of the sidereal system, as Sir John Herschel termed it--that\r\nwe are compelled to include them all as connected portions of one grand\r\nand, to some extent, symmetrical universe, whose remarkable and opposite\r\nmode of distribution over the heavens may probably afford a clue to the\r\nmode of development of that universe and to the changes that are even now\r\ntaking place within it. The maps referred to above are of such great\r\nimportance, and are so essential to a clear comprehension of the nature and\r\nconstitution of the vast sidereal system which surrounds us, that I have,\r\nwith the permission of the Royal Astronomical Society, reproduced them\r\nhere. (See end of volume.)\r\n\r\nA careful examination of them will give a clearer idea of the very\r\nremarkable facts of distribution of star-clusters and nebulæ than can be\r\nafforded by any amount of description or of numerical statements.\r\n\r\nThe forms of many of the nebulæ are very curious. Some are quite irregular,\r\nas the Orion nebula, the Keyhole nebula in the southern hemisphere, and\r\nmany others. Some show a decidedly spiral form, as those in Andromeda and\r\nCanes Venatici; others again are annular or ring-shaped, as those in Lyra\r\nand Cygnus, while a considerable number are termed planetary nebulæ, from\r\ntheir exhibiting a faint circular disc like that of a planet. Many have\r\nstars or groups of stars evidently forming parts of them, and this is\r\nespecially the case with those of the largest size. But all these are\r\ncomparatively few in number and more or less exceptional in type, the great\r\nmajority being minute cloudy specks only visible with good telescopes, and\r\nso faint as to leave much doubt as to their exact shape and nature. Sir\r\nJohn Herschel catalogued 5000 in 1864, and more than 8000 were discovered\r\nup to 1890; while the application of the camera has so increased the\r\nnumbers that it is thought there may really be many hundreds of thousands\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope shows the larger irregular nebulæ to be gaseous, as are\r\nthe annular and planetary nebulæ as well as many very brilliant white\r\nstars; and all these objects are most frequent in or near the Milky Way.\r\nTheir spectra show a green line not produced by any terrestrial element.\r\nWith the great Lick telescope several of the planetary nebulæ have been\r\nfound to be irregular and sometimes to be formed of compressed or looped\r\nrings and other curious forms.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller nebulæ are double or triple, but whether they really\r\nform revolving systems is not yet known. The great mass of the small nebulæ\r\nthat occupy large tracts of the heavens remote from the Galaxy are often\r\ntermed irresolvable nebulæ, because the highest powers of the largest\r\ntelescopes show no indication of their being star-clusters, while they are\r\ntoo faint to give any definite indications of structure in the\r\nspectroscope. But many of them resemble comets in their forms, and it is\r\nthought not impossible that they may be not very dissimilar in\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review the main features presented to us in the\r\nheavens outside the solar system, so far as regards the numbers and\r\ndistribution of the lucid stars (those visible to the naked eye) as well as\r\nthose brought to view by the telescope; the form and chief characteristics\r\nof the Milky Way or Galaxy; and lastly, the numbers and distribution of\r\nthose interesting objects--star-clusters and nebulæ in their special\r\nrelations to the Milky Way. This examination has brought clearly before us\r\nthe unity of the whole visible universe; that everything we can see, or\r\nobtain any knowledge of, with all the resources of modern gigantic\r\ntelescopes, of the photographic plate, and of the even more marvellous\r\nspectroscope, forms parts of one vast system which may be shortly and\r\nappropriately termed the Stellar universe.\r\n\r\nIn our next chapter we shall carry the investigation a step further, by\r\nsketching in outline what is known of the motions and distances of the\r\nstars, and thus obtain some important information bearing upon our special\r\nsubject of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDISTANCE OF THE STARS--THE SUN'S MOTION THROUGH SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early ages, before any approximate idea was reached of the great\r\ndistances of the stars from us, the simple conception of a crystal sphere\r\nto which these luminous points were attached and carried round every day on\r\nan axis near which our pole-star is situated, satisfied the demands for an\r\nexplanation of the phenomena. But when Copernicus set forth the true\r\narrangement of the heavenly bodies, earth and planets alike revolving round\r\nthe sun at distances of many millions of miles, and when this scheme was\r\nenforced by the laws of Kepler and the telescopic discoveries of Galileo, a\r\ndifficulty arose which astronomers were unable satisfactorily to overcome.\r\nIf, said they, the earth revolves round the sun at a distance which cannot\r\nbe less (according to Kepler's measurement of the distance of Mars at\r\nopposition) than 13-1/2 millions of miles, then how is it that the nearer\r\nstars are not seen to shift their apparent places when viewed from opposite\r\nsides of this enormous orbit? Copernicus, and after him Kepler and Galileo,\r\nstoutly maintained that it was because the stars were at such an enormous\r\ndistance from us that the earth's orbit was a mere point in comparison.\r\nBut this seemed wholly incredible, even to the great observer Tycho Brahé,\r\nand hence the Copernican theory was not so generally accepted as it\r\notherwise would have been.\r\n\r\nGalileo always declared that the measurement would some day be made, and he\r\neven suggested the method of effecting it which is now found to be the most\r\ntrustworthy. But the sun's distance had to be first measured with greater\r\naccuracy, and that was only done in the latter part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury by means of transits of Venus; and by later observations with more\r\nperfect instruments it is now pretty well fixed at about 92,780,000 miles,\r\nthe limits of error being such that 92-3/4 millions may perhaps be quite as\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nWith such an enormous base-line as twice this distance, which is available\r\nby making observations at intervals of about six months when the earth is\r\nat opposite points in its orbit, it seemed certain that some parallax or\r\ndisplacement of the nearer stars could be found, and many astronomers with\r\nthe best instruments devoted themselves to the work. But the difficulties\r\nwere enormous, and very few really satisfactory results were obtained till\r\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century. About forty stars have now been\r\nmeasured with tolerable certainty, though of course with a considerable\r\nmargin of possible or probable error; and about thirty more, which are\r\nfound to have a parallax of one-tenth of a second or less, must be\r\nconsidered to leave a very large margin of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe two nearest fixed stars are Alpha Centauri and 61 Cygni. The former is\r\none of the brightest stars in the southern hemisphere, and is about\r\n275,000 times as far from us as the sun. The light from this star will take\r\n4-1/4 years to reach us, and this 'light-journey,' as it is termed, is\r\ngenerally used by astronomers as an easily remembered mode of recording the\r\ndistances of the fixed stars, the distance in miles--in this case about 25\r\nmillions of millions--being very cumbrous. The other star, 61 Cygni, is\r\nonly of about the fifth magnitude, yet it is the second nearest to us, with\r\na light-journey of about 7-1/4 years. If we had no other determinations of\r\ndistance than these two, the facts would be of the highest importance. They\r\nteach us, first, that magnitude or brightness of a star is no proof of\r\nnearness to us, a fact of which there is much other evidence; and in the\r\nsecond place, they furnish us with a probable minimum distance of\r\nindependent suns from one another, which, in proportion to their sizes,\r\nsome being known to be many times larger than our sun, is not more than we\r\nmight expect. This remoteness may be partly due to those which were once\r\nnearer together having coalesced under the influence of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAs this measurement of the distance of the nearer stars should be clearly\r\nunderstood by every one who wishes to obtain some real comprehension of the\r\nscale of this vast universe of which we form a part, the method now adopted\r\nand found to be most effectual will be briefly explained.\r\n\r\nEveryone who is acquainted with the rudiments of trigonometry or\r\nmensuration, knows that an inaccessible distance can be accurately\r\ndetermined if we can measure a base-line from both ends of which the\r\ninaccessible object can be seen, and if we have a good instrument with\r\nwhich to measure angles. The accuracy will mainly depend upon our base-line\r\nbeing not excessively short in comparison with the distance to be measured.\r\nIf it is as much as half or even a quarter as long the measurement may be\r\nas accurate as if directly performed over the ground, but if it is only\r\none-hundredth or one-thousandth part as long, a very small error either in\r\nthe length of the base or in the amount of the angles will produce a large\r\nerror in the result.\r\n\r\nIn measuring the distance of the moon, the earth's diameter, or a\r\nconsiderable portion of it, has served as a base-line. Either two observers\r\nat great distances from each other, or the same observer after an interval\r\nof nine or ten hours, may examine the moon from positions six or seven\r\nthousand miles apart, and by accurate measurements of its angular distance\r\nfrom a star, or by the time of its passage over the meridian of the place\r\nas observed with a transit instrument, the angular displacement can be\r\nfound and the distance determined with very great accuracy, although that\r\ndistance is more than thirty times the length of the base. The distance of\r\nthe planet Mars when nearest to us has been found in the same way. His\r\ndistance from us even when at his nearest point during the most favourable\r\noppositions is about 36 million miles, or more than four thousand times the\r\nearth's diameter, so that it requires the most delicate observations many\r\ntimes repeated and with the finest instruments to obtain a tolerably\r\napproximate result. When this is done, by Kepler's law of the fixed\r\nproportion between the distances of planets from the sun and their times of\r\nrevolution, the proportionate distance of all the other planets and that\r\nof the sun can be ascertained. This method, however, is not sufficiently\r\naccurate to satisfy astronomers, because upon the sun's distance that of\r\nevery other member of the solar system depends. Fortunately there are two\r\nother methods by which this important measurement has been made with much\r\ngreater approach to certainty and precision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram illustrating the transit of Venus.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these methods is by means of the rare occasions when the\r\nplanet Venus passes across the sun's disc as seen from the earth. When this\r\ntakes place, observations of the transit, as it is termed, are made at\r\nremote parts of the earth, the distance between which places can of course\r\neasily be calculated from their latitudes and longitudes. The diagram here\r\ngiven illustrates the simplest mode of determining the sun's distance by\r\nthis observation, and the following description from Proctor's _Old and New\r\nAstronomy_ is so clear that I copy it verbally:--'V represents Venus\r\npassing between the Earth E and the Sun S; and we see how an observer at E\r\nwill see Venus as at v', while an observer at E' will see her as at v. The\r\nmeasurement of the distance v v', as compared with the diameter of the\r\nsun's disc, determines the angle v V v' or E V E'; whence the distance E V\r\ncan be calculated from the known length of the base-line E E'. For\r\ninstance, it is known (from the known proportions of the Solar System as\r\ndetermined from the times of revolution by Kepler's third law) that E V\r\nbears to V v the proportion 28 to 72, or 7 to 18; whence E E' bears to v v'\r\nthe same proportion. Suppose, now, that the distance between the two\r\nstations is known to be 7000 miles, so that v v' is 18,000 miles; and that\r\nv v' is found by accurate measurement to be 1/48 part of the sun's\r\ndiameter. Then the sun's diameter, as determined by this observation, is 48\r\ntimes 18,000 miles, or 864,000 miles; whence from his known apparent size,\r\nwhich is that of a globe 107-1/3 times farther away from us than its own\r\ndiameter, his distance is found to be 92,736,000 miles.'\r\n\r\nOf course, there being two observers, the proportion of the distance v v'\r\nto the diameter of the sun's disc cannot be measured directly, but each of\r\nthem can measure the apparent angular distance of the planet from the sun's\r\nupper and lower margins as it passes across the disc, and thus the angular\r\ndistance between the two lines of transit can be obtained. The distance v\r\nv' can also be found by accurately noting the times of the upper and lower\r\npassage of Venus, which, as the line of transit is considerably shorter in\r\none than the other, gives by the known properties of the circle the exact\r\nproportion of the distance between them to the sun's diameter; and as this\r\nis found to be the most accurate method, it is the one generally adopted.\r\nFor this purpose the stations of the observers are so chosen that the\r\nlength of the two chords, v and v', may have a considerable difference,\r\nthus rendering the measurement more easy.\r\n\r\nThe other method of determining the sun's distance is by the direct\r\nmeasurement of the velocity of light. This was first done by the French\r\nphysicist, Fizeau, in 1849, by the use of rapidly revolving mirrors, as\r\ndescribed in most works on physics. This method has now been brought to\r\nsuch a decree of perfection that the sun's distance so determined is\r\nconsidered to be equally trustworthy with that derived from the transits of\r\nVenus. The reason that the determination of the velocity of light leads to\r\na determination of the sun's distance is, because the time taken by light\r\nto pass from the sun to the earth is independently known to be 8 min.\r\n13-1/3 sec. This was discovered so long ago as 1675 by means of the\r\neclipses of Jupiter's satellites. These satellites revolve round the planet\r\nin from 1-3/4 to 16 days, and, owing to their moving very nearly in the\r\nplane of the ecliptic and the shadow of Jupiter being so large, the three\r\nwhich are nearest to the planet are eclipsed at every revolution. This\r\nrapid revolution of the satellites and frequency of the eclipses enabled\r\ntheir periods of recurrence to be determined with extreme accuracy,\r\nespecially after many years of careful observation. It was then found that\r\nwhen Jupiter was at its farthest distance from the earth the eclipses of\r\nthe satellites took place a little more than eight minutes later than the\r\ntime calculated from the mean period of revolution, and when the planet was\r\nnearest to us the eclipses occurred the same amount earlier. And when\r\nfurther observation showed that there was no difference between calculation\r\nand observation when the planet was at its mean distance from us, and that\r\nthe error arose and increased exactly in proportion to our varying\r\ndistance from it, then it became clear that the only cause adequate to\r\nproduce such an effect was, that light had not an infinite velocity but\r\ntravelled at a certain fixed rate. This however, though a highly probable\r\nexplanation, was not absolutely proved till nearly two centuries later, by\r\nmeans of two very difficult measurements--that of the actual distance of\r\nthe sun from the earth, and that of the actual speed of light in miles per\r\nsecond; the latter corresponding almost exactly with the speed deduced from\r\nthe eclipses of Jupiter's satellites and the sun's distance as measured by\r\nthe transits of Venus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (A) and the last 2 lines of the next paragraph should be\r\nreplaced with: one-tenth of an inch long, and from a point (A) 5-3/4\r\ninches from it (accurately 5.72957795 inches) we draw straight lines to\r\nB and C. Then the angle at A is one degree.)]\r\n\r\nBut this problem of measuring the sun's distance, and through it the\r\ndimensions of the orbits of all the planets of our system, sinks into\r\ninsignificance when compared with the enormous difficulties in the way of\r\nthe determination of the distance of the stars. As a great many people,\r\nperhaps the majority of the readers of any popular scientific book, have\r\nlittle knowledge of mathematics and cannot realise what an angle of a\r\nminute or a second really means, a little explanation and illustration of\r\nthese terms will not be out of place. An angle of one degree (1°) is the\r\n360th part of a circle (viewed from its centre), the 90th part of a right\r\nangle, the 60th part of either of the angles of an equilateral triangle. To\r\nsee exactly how much is an angle of one degree we draw a short line (B C)\r\none-tenth of an inch long, and from a point we draw straight lines to B\r\nand C. Then the angle at A is one degree.\r\n\r\nNow, in all astronomical work, one degree is considered to be quite a large\r\nangle. Even before the invention of the telescope the old observers fixed\r\nthe position of the stars and planets to half or a quarter of a degree,\r\nwhile Mr. Proctor thinks that Tycho Brahé's positions of the stars and\r\nplanets were correct to about one or two minutes of arc. But a minute of\r\narc is obtained by dividing the line B C into sixty equal parts and seeing\r\nthe distance between two of these with the naked eye from the point A. But\r\nas very long-sighted people can see very minute objects at 10 or 12 inches\r\ndistance, we may double the distance A B, and then making the line B C one\r\nthree-hundredth part of an inch long, we shall have the angle of one minute\r\nwhich Tycho Brahé was perhaps able to measure. How very large an amount a\r\nminute is to the modern astronomer is, however, well shown by the fact that\r\nthe maximum difference between the calculated and observed positions of\r\nUranus, which led Adams and Leverrier to search for and discover Neptune,\r\nwas only 1-1/2 minutes, a space so small as to be almost invisible to the\r\naverage eye, so that if there had been two planets, one in the calculated,\r\nthe other in the observed place, they would have appeared as one to\r\nunassisted vision.\r\n\r\nIn order now to realise what one second of arc really means, let us look at\r\nthe circle here shown, which is as nearly as possible one-tenth of an inch\r\nin diameter--(one-O-tenth of an inch). If we remove this circle to a\r\ndistance of 28 feet 8 inches it will subtend an angle of one minute, and we\r\nshall have to place it at a distance of nearly 1730 feet--almost one-third\r\nof a mile--to reduce the angle to one second. But the very nearest to us of\r\nthe fixed stars, Alpha Centauri, has a parallax of only three-fourths of a\r\nsecond; that is, the distance of the earth from the sun--about 92-3/4\r\nmillions of miles--would appear no wider, seen from the nearest star, than\r\ndoes three-fourths of the above small circle at one-third of a mile\r\ndistance. To see this circle at all at that distance would require a very\r\ngood telescope with a power of at least 100, while to see any small part of\r\nit and to measure the proportion of that part to the whole would need very\r\nbrilliant illumination and a large and powerful astronomical telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A MILLION?\r\n\r\nBut when we have to deal with millions, and even with hundreds and\r\nthousands of millions, there is another difficulty--that few people can\r\nform any clear conception of what a million is. It has been suggested that\r\nin every large school the walls of one room or hall should be devoted to\r\nshowing a million at one view. For this purpose it would be necessary to\r\nhave a hundred large sheets of paper each about 4 feet 6 inches square,\r\nruled in quarter inch squares. In each alternate square a round black wafer\r\nor circle should be placed a little over-lapping the square, thus leaving\r\nan equal amount of white space between the black spots. At each tenth spot\r\na double width should be left so as to separate each hundred spots (10 ×\r\n10). Each sheet would then hold ten thousand spots, which would all be\r\ndistinctly visible from the middle of a room 20 feet wide, each horizontal\r\nor vertical row containing a thousand. One hundred such sheets would\r\ncontain a million spots, and they would occupy a space 450 feet long in one\r\nrow, or 90 feet long in five rows, so that they would entirely cover the\r\nwalls of a room, about 30 feet square and 25 feet high, from floor to\r\nceiling, allowing space for doors but not for windows, the hall or gallery\r\nbeing lighted from above. Such a hall would be in the highest degree\r\neducational in a country where millions are spoken of so glibly and wasted\r\nso recklessly; while no one can really appreciate modern science, dealing\r\nas it does with the unimaginably great and little, unless he is enabled to\r\nrealise by actual vision, and summing up, what a vast number is comprised\r\nin _one_ of those millions, which, in modern astronomy and physics, he has\r\nto deal with not singly only, but by hundreds and thousands or even by\r\nmillions. In every considerable town, at all events, a hall or gallery\r\nshould have a _million_ thus shown upon its walls. It would in no way\r\ninterfere with the walls being covered when required with maps, or\r\nornamental hangings, or pictures; but when these were removed, the visible\r\nand countable million would remain as a permanent lesson to all visitors;\r\nand I believe that it would have widespread beneficial effects in almost\r\nevery department of human thought and action. On a small scale any one can\r\ndo this for himself by getting a hundred sheets of engineer's paper ruled\r\nin small squares, and making the spots very small; and even this would be\r\nimpressive, but not so much so as on the larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable every reader of this volume at once to form some\r\nconception of the number of units in a million, I have made an estimate of\r\nthe number of _letters_ contained in it, and I find them to amount to about\r\n420,000--considerably less than half a million. Try and realise, when\r\nreading it, that if every letter were a pound sterling, we waste as many\r\npounds as there are letters in _two_ such volumes whenever we build a\r\nbattleship.\r\n\r\nHaving thus obtained some real conception of the immensity of a million, we\r\ncan better realise what it must be to have every one of the dots above\r\ndescribed, or every one of the letters in two such volumes as this\r\nlengthened out so as to be each a mile long, and even then we should have\r\nreached little more than a hundredth part of the distance from our earth to\r\nthe sun. When, by careful consideration of these figures, we have even\r\npartially realised this enormous distance, we may take the next step, which\r\nis, to compare this distance with that of the nearest fixed star. We have\r\nseen that the parallax of that star is three-fourths of a second, an amount\r\nwhich implies that the star is 271,400 times as far from us as our sun is.\r\nIf after _seeing_ what a million is, and knowing that the sun is 92-3/4\r\ntimes this distance from us in miles--a distance which itself is almost\r\ninconceivable to us--we find that we have to multiply this almost\r\ninconceivable distance 271,400 times--more than a quarter of a million\r\ntimes--to reach the _nearest_ of the fixed stars, we shall begin to\r\nrealise, however imperfectly, how vast is the system of suns around us, and\r\non what a scale of immensity the material universe, which we see so\r\ngloriously displayed in the starry heavens and the mysterious galaxy, is\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat lengthy preliminary discussion is thought necessary in order\r\nthat my readers may form some idea of the enormous difficulty of obtaining\r\nany measurement whatever of such distances. I now propose to point out what\r\nthe special difficulties are, and how they have been overcome; and thus I\r\nhope to be able to satisfy them that the figures astronomers give us of the\r\ndistances of the stars are in no way mere guesses or probabilities, but are\r\nreal measurements which, within certain not very wide limits of error, may\r\nbe trusted as giving us correct ideas of the magnitude of the visible\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF STELLAR DISTANCES\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty of this measurement is, of course, that the\r\ndistances are so vast that the longest available base-line, the diameter of\r\nthe earth's orbit, only subtends an angle of little more than a second from\r\nthe nearest star, while for all the rest it is less than one second and\r\noften only a small fraction of it. But this difficulty, great as it is, is\r\nrendered far greater by the fact that there is no fixed point in the\r\nheavens from which to measure, since many of the stars are known to be in\r\nmotion, and all are believed to be so in varying degrees, while the sun\r\nitself is now known to be moving among the stars at a rate which is not yet\r\naccurately determined, but in a direction which is fairly well known. As\r\nthe various motions of the earth while passing round the sun, though\r\nextremely complex, are very accurately known, it was first attempted to\r\ndetermine the changed position of stars by observations, many times\r\nrepeated at six months' intervals, of the moment of their passage over the\r\nmeridian and their distance from the zenith; and then by allowing for all\r\nthe known motions of the earth, such as precession of the equinoxes and\r\nnutation of the earth's axis, as well as for refraction and for the\r\naberration of light, to determine what residual effect was due to the\r\ndifference of position from which the star was viewed; and a result was\r\nthus obtained in several cases, though almost always a larger one than has\r\nbeen found by later observations and by better methods. These earlier\r\nobservations, however perfect the instruments and however skilful the\r\nobserver, are liable to errors which it seems impossible to avoid. The\r\ninstruments themselves are subject in all their parts to expansion and\r\ncontraction by changes of temperature; and when these changes are sudden,\r\none part of the instrument may be affected more than another, and this will\r\noften lead to minute errors which may seriously affect the amount to be\r\nmeasured when that is so small. Another source of error is due to\r\natmospheric refraction, which is subject to changes both from hour to hour\r\nand at different seasons. But perhaps most important of all are minute\r\nchanges in level of the foundations of the instruments even when they are\r\ncarried down to solid rock. Both changes of temperature and changes of\r\nmoisture of the soil produce minute alterations of level; while\r\nearth-tremors and slow movements of elevation or depression are now known\r\nto be very frequent. Owing to all these causes, actual measurements of\r\ndifferences of position at different times of the year, amounting to small\r\nfractions of a second, are found to be too uncertain for the determination\r\nof such minute angles with the required accuracy.\r\n\r\nBut there is another method which avoids almost all these sources of error,\r\nand this is now generally preferred and adopted for these measurements. It\r\nis, that of measuring the distance between two stars situated apparently\r\nvery near each other, one of which has large proper motion, while the other\r\nhas none which is measurable. The proper motions of the stars was first\r\nsuspected by Halley in 1717, from finding that several stars, whose places\r\nhad been given by Hipparchus, 130 B.C., were not in the positions where\r\nthey now ought to be; and other observations by the old astronomers,\r\nespecially those of occultations of stars by the moon, led to the same\r\nresult. Since the time of Halley very accurate observations of the stars\r\nhave been made, and in many cases it is found that they move perceptibly\r\nfrom year to year, while others move so slowly that it is only after forty\r\nor fifty years that the motion can be detected. The greatest proper motions\r\nyet determined amount to between 7\" and 8\" in a year, while other stars\r\nrequire twenty, or even fifty or a hundred years to show an equal amount of\r\ndisplacement. At first it was thought that the brightest stars would have\r\nthe largest proper motion, because it was supposed they were nearest to us,\r\nbut it was soon found that many small and quite inconspicuous stars moved\r\nas rapidly as the most brilliant, while in many very bright stars no\r\nproper motion at all can be detected. That which moves most rapidly is a\r\nsmall star of less than the sixth magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that the motion of things at a\r\ndistance cannot be perceived so well as when near, even though the speed\r\nmay be the same. If a man is seen on the top of a hill several miles off,\r\nwe have to observe him closely for some time before we can be sure whether\r\nhe is walking or standing still. But objects so enormously distant as we\r\nnow know that the stars are, may be moving at the rate of many miles in a\r\nsecond and yet require years of observation to detect any movement at all.\r\n\r\nThe proper motions of nearly a hundred stars have now been ascertained to\r\nbe more than one second of arc annually, while a large number have less\r\nthan this, and the majority have no perceptible motion, presumably due to\r\ntheir enormous distance from us. It is therefore not difficult in most\r\ncases to find one or two motionless stars sufficiently close to a star\r\nhaving a large proper motion (anything more than one-tenth of a second is\r\nso called) to serve as fixed points of measurement. All that is then\r\nrequired is, to measure with extreme accuracy the angular distance of the\r\nmoving from the fixed stars at intervals of six months. The measurements\r\ncan be made, however, on every fine night, each one being compared with one\r\nat nearly an interval of six months from it. In this way a hundred or more\r\nmeasurements of the same star may be made in a year, and the mean of the\r\nwhole, allowance being made for proper motion in the interval, will give a\r\nmuch more accurate result than any single measurement. This kind of\r\nmeasurement can be made with extreme accuracy when the two stars can be\r\nseen together in the field of the telescope; either by the use of a\r\nmicrometer, or by means of an instrument called a heliometer, now often\r\nconstructed for the purpose. This is an astronomical telescope of rather\r\nlarge size, the object glass of which is cut in two straight across the\r\ncentre, and the two halves made to slide upon each other by means of an\r\nexceedingly fine and accurate screw-motion, so adjusted and tested as to\r\nmeasure the angular distance of two objects with extreme accuracy. This is\r\ndone by the number of turns of the screw required to bring the two stars\r\ninto contact with each other, the image of each one being formed by one of\r\nthe halves of the object glass.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest advantage of this method of determining parallax is, as\r\nSir John Herschell points out, that it gets rid of all the sources of error\r\nwhich render the older methods so uncertain and inaccurate. No corrections\r\nare required for precession, nutation, or aberration, since these affect\r\nboth stars alike, as is the case also with refraction; while alterations of\r\nlevel of the instrument have no prejudicial effect, since the measures of\r\nangular distance taken by this method are quite independent of such\r\nmovements. A test of the accuracy of the determination of parallax by this\r\ninstrument is the very close agreement of different observers, and also\r\ntheir agreement with the new and perhaps even superior method by\r\nphotography. This method was first adopted by Professor Pritchard of the\r\nOxford Observatory, with a fine reflector of thirteen inches aperture. Its\r\ngreat advantage is, that all the small stars in the vicinity of the star\r\nwhose parallax is sought are shown in their exact positions upon the plate,\r\nand the distances of all of them from it can be very accurately measured,\r\nand by comparing plates taken at six months' intervals, each of these stars\r\ngives a determination of parallax, so that the mean of the whole will lead\r\nto a very accurate result. Should, however, the result from any one of\r\nthese stars differ considerably from that derived from the rest, it will be\r\ndue in all probability to that star having a proper motion of its own, and\r\nit may therefore be rejected. To illustrate the amount of labour bestowed\r\nby astronomers on this difficult problem, it may be mentioned that for the\r\nphotographic measurement of the star 61 Cygni, 330 separate plates were\r\ntaken in 1886-7, and on these 30,000 measurements of distances of the pairs\r\nof star-images were made. The result agreed closely with the best previous\r\ndetermination by Sir Robert Ball, using the micrometer, and the method was\r\nat once admitted by astronomers as being of the greatest value.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a rule, stars having large proper motions are found to be\r\ncomparatively near us, there is no regular proportion between these\r\nquantities, indicating that the rapidity of the motion of the stars varies\r\ngreatly. Among fifty stars whose distances have been fairly well\r\ndetermined, the rate of actual motion varies from one or two up to more\r\nthan a hundred miles per second. Among six stars with less than a tenth of\r\na second of annual proper motion there is one with a parallax of nearly\r\nhalf a second, and another of one-ninth of a second, so that they are\r\nnearer to us than many stars which move several seconds a year. This may be\r\ndue to actual slowness of motion, but is almost certainly caused in part by\r\ntheir motion being either towards us or away from us, and therefore only\r\nmeasurable by the spectroscope; and this had not been done when the lists\r\nof parallaxes and proper motions from which these facts are taken were\r\npublished. It is evident that the actual direction and rate of motion of a\r\nstar cannot be known till this radial movement, as it is termed--that is,\r\ntowards or away from us--has been measured; but as this element always\r\ntends to increase the visually observed rate of motion, we cannot, through\r\nits absence, exaggerate the actual motions of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN'S MOVEMENT THROUGH SPACE\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another important factor which affects the apparent\r\nmotions of all the stars--the movement of our sun, which, being a star\r\nitself, has a proper motion of its own. This motion was suspected and\r\nsought for by Sir William Herschel a century ago, and he actually\r\ndetermined the direction of its motion towards a point in the constellation\r\nHercules, not very far removed from that fixed upon as the average of the\r\nbest observations since made. The method of determining this motion is very\r\nsimple, but at the same time very difficult. When we are travelling in a\r\nrailway carriage near objects pass rapidly out of sight behind us, while\r\nthose farther from us remain longer in view, and very distant objects\r\nappear almost stationary for a considerable time. For the same reason, if\r\nour sun is moving in any direction through space, the nearer stars will\r\nappear to travel in an opposite direction to our movement, while the more\r\ndistant will remain quite stationary. This movement of the nearest stars is\r\ndetected by an examination and comparison of their proper motions, by which\r\nit is found that in one part of the heavens there is a preponderance of the\r\nproper motions in one direction and a deficiency in the opposite direction,\r\nwhile in the directions at right angles to these the proper motions are not\r\non the average greater in one direction than in the opposite. But the\r\nproper motions of the stars being themselves so minute, and also so\r\nirregular, it is only by a most elaborate mathematical investigation of the\r\nmotions of hundreds or even of thousands of stars, that the direction of\r\nthe solar motion can be determined. Till quite recently astronomers were\r\nagreed that the motion was towards a point in Hercules near the\r\noutstretched arm in the figure of that constellation. But the latest\r\ninquiries into this problem, involving the comparison of the motions of\r\nseveral thousand stars in all parts of the heavens, have led to the\r\nconclusion that the most probable direction of the 'solar apex' (as the\r\npoint towards which the sun is moving is termed), is in the adjacent\r\nconstellation Lyra, and not far from the brilliant star Vega. This is the\r\nposition which Professor Newcomb of Washington thinks most probable, though\r\nthere is still room for further investigation. To determine the rate of the\r\nmotion is very much more difficult than to fix its direction, because the\r\ndistances of so few stars have been determined, and very few indeed of\r\nthese lie in the directions best adapted to give accurate results. The best\r\nmeasurements down to 1890 led to a motion of about 15 miles a second. But\r\nmore recently the American astronomer, Campbell, has determined by the\r\nspectroscope the motion in the line of sight of a considerable number of\r\nstars towards and away from the solar apex, and by comparing the average of\r\nthese motions, he derives a motion for the sun of about 12-1/2 miles a\r\nsecond, and this is probably as near as we can yet reach towards the true\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NUMERICAL RESULTS OF THE ABOVE MEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\nThe measurements of distances and proper motions of a considerable number\r\nof the stars, of the motion of our sun in space (its proper motion),\r\ntogether with accurate determinations of the comparative brilliancy of the\r\nbrightest stars as compared with our sun and with each other, have led to\r\nsome very remarkable numerical results which serve as indications of the\r\nscale of magnitude of the stellar universe.\r\n\r\nThe parallaxes of about fifty stars have now been repeatedly measured with\r\nsuch consistent results that Professor Newcomb considers them to be fairly\r\ntrustworthy, and these vary from one-hundredth to three-quarters of a\r\nsecond. Three more, all stars of the first magnitude--Rigel, Canopus, and\r\nAlpha Cygni--have no measurable parallax, notwithstanding the\r\nlong-continued efforts of many astronomers, affording a striking example of\r\nthe fact that brilliancy alone is no test of proximity. Six more stars\r\nhave a parallax of only one-fiftieth of a second, and five of these are\r\neither of the first or second magnitudes. Of these nine stars having very\r\nsmall parallax or none, six are situated in or near to the Milky Way,\r\nanother indication of exceeding remoteness, which is further shown by the\r\nfact that they all have a very small proper motion or none at all. These\r\nfacts support the conclusion, which had been already reached by astronomers\r\nfrom a careful study of the distribution of the stars, that the larger\r\nportion of the stars of all magnitudes scattered throughout the Milky Way\r\nor along its borders really belong to the same great system, and may be\r\nsaid to form a part of it. This is a conclusion of extreme importance\r\nbecause it teaches us that the grandest of the suns, such as Rigel and\r\nBetelgeuse in the constellation Orion, Antares in the Scorpion, Deneb in\r\nthe Swan (Alpha Cygni), and Canopus (Alpha Argus), are in all probability\r\nas far removed from us as are the innumerable minute stars which give the\r\nnebulous or milky appearance to the Galaxy.\r\n\r\nIt is well to consider for a moment what these facts mean. Professor S.\r\nNewcomb, one of the highest authorities on these problems, tells us that\r\nthe long series of measurements to discover the parallax of Canopus, the\r\nbrightest star in the southern hemisphere, would have shown a parallax of\r\none-hundredth of a second, had such existed. Yet the results always seemed\r\nto converge to a mean of 0\".000! Suppose, then, we assume the parallax of\r\nthis star to be somewhat less than the hundredth of a second--let us say\r\n1/125 of a second. At the distance this gives, light would take almost\r\nexactly 400 years to reach us, so that if we suppose this very brilliant\r\nstar to be situated a little on this side of the Galaxy, we must give to\r\nthat great luminous circle of stars a distance of about 500 light years. We\r\nshall now perceive the advantage of being able to realise what a million\r\nreally is. A person who had once seen a wall-space more than 100 feet long\r\nand 20 feet high completely covered with quarter-inch spots a quarter of an\r\ninch apart; and then tried to imagine every spot to be a mile long and to\r\nbe placed end to end in one row, would form a very different conception of\r\na million miles than those who almost daily _read_ of millions, but are\r\nquite unable to visualise even one of them. Having really seen one million,\r\nwe can partially realise the velocity of light, which travels over this\r\nmillion miles in a little less than 5-1/2 seconds; and yet light takes more\r\nthan 4-1/3 years at this inconceivable speed to come to us from the very\r\n_nearest_ of the stars. To realise this still more impressively, let us\r\ntake the _distance_ of this nearest star, which is 26 _millions_ of\r\n_millions_ of miles. Let us look in imagination at this large and lofty\r\nhall covered from floor to ceiling with quarter-inch spots--only _one_\r\nmillion. Let all these be imagined as miles. Then repeat this number of\r\nmiles in a straight line, one after the other, as many times as there are\r\nspots in this hall; and even then you have reached only one twenty-sixth\r\npart of the distance to the nearest fixed star! This _million_ times a\r\n_million_ miles has to be repeated twenty-six times to reach the _nearest_\r\nfixed star; and it seems probable that this gives us a good indication of\r\nthe distance from each other of at least all the stars down to the sixth\r\nmagnitude, perhaps even of a large number of the telescopic stars. But as\r\nwe have found that the bright stars of the Milky Way must be at least one\r\nhundred times farther from us than these nearest stars, we have found what\r\nmay be termed a minimum distance for that vast star-ring. It may be\r\nimmensely farther, but it is hardly possible that it should be anything\r\nless.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBABLE SIZE OF THE STARS\r\n\r\nHaving thus obtained an inferior limit for the distance of several stars of\r\nthe first magnitude, and their actual brilliancy or light-emission as\r\ncompared with our sun having been carefully measured, we have afforded us\r\nsome indication of size though perhaps an uncertain one. By these means it\r\nhas been found that Rigel gives out about ten thousand times as much light\r\nas our sun, so that if its surface is of the same brightness, it must be a\r\nhundred times the diameter of the sun. But as it is one of the white or\r\nSirian type of stars it is probably very much more luminous, but even if it\r\nwere twenty times brighter it would still have to be twenty-two and a half\r\ntimes the diameter of the sun; and as the stars of this type are probably\r\nwholly gaseous and much less dense than our sun, this enormous size may not\r\nbe far from the truth. It is believed that the Sirian stars generally have\r\na greater surface brilliancy than our sun. Beta Aurigæ, a star of the\r\nsecond magnitude but of the Sirian type, is one of the double stars whose\r\ndistance has been measured, and this has enabled Mr. Gore to find the mass\r\nof the binary system to be five times that of the sun, and their light one\r\nhundred and seventeen times greater. Even if the density is much less than\r\nthe sun's, the intrinsic brilliancy of the surface will be considerably\r\ngreater. Another double star, Gamma Leonis, has been found to be three\r\nhundred times more brilliant than the sun if of the same density, but it\r\nwould require to be seven times rarer than air to have the extent of\r\nsurface needed to give the same amount of light if its surface emitted no\r\nmore light than our sun from equal areas.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that many of the stars are much larger than our sun\r\nas well as more luminous; but there are also large numbers of small stars\r\nwhose large proper motions, as well as the actual measurement of some,\r\nprove them to be comparatively near to us which yet are only about\r\none-fiftieth part as bright as the sun. These must, therefore, be either\r\ncomparatively small, or if large must be but slightly luminous. In the case\r\nof some double stars it has been proved that the latter is the case; but it\r\nseems probable that others are very much smaller than the average. Up to\r\nthe present time no means of determining the size of a star by actual\r\nmeasurement has been discovered, since their distances are so enormous that\r\nthe most powerful telescopes show only a point of light. But now that we\r\nhave really measured the distance of a good many stars we are able to\r\ndetermine an upper limit for their actual dimensions. As the nearest fixed\r\nstar, Alpha Centauri, has a parallax of 0\".75, this means that if this star\r\nhas a diameter as great as our distance from the sun (which is not much\r\nmore than a hundred times the sun's diameter) it would be seen to have a\r\ndistinct disc about as large as that of Jupiter's first satellite. If it\r\nwere even one-tenth of the size supposed it would probably be seen as a\r\ndisc in our best modern telescopes. The late Mr. Ranyard remarks that if\r\nthe Nebular Hypothesis is true, and our sun once extended as far as the\r\norbit of Neptune, then, among the millions of visible suns there ought to\r\nbe some now to be found in every stage of development. But any sun having a\r\ndiameter at all approaching this size, and situated as far off as a hundred\r\ntimes the distance of Alpha Centauri, would be seen by the Lick telescope\r\nto have a disc half a second in diameter. Hence the fact that there are no\r\nstars with visible discs proves that there are no suns of the required\r\nsize, and adds another argument, though not perhaps a strong one, against\r\nthe acceptance of the Nebular Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE UNITY AND EVOLUTION OF THE STAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very condensed sketch now given of such of the discoveries of recent\r\nAstronomy as relate to the subject we are discussing will, it is hoped,\r\ngive some idea both of the work already done and of the number of\r\ninteresting problems yet remaining to be solved. The most eminent\r\nastronomers in every part of the world look forward to the solution of\r\nthese problems not, perhaps, as of any great value in themselves, but as\r\nsteps towards a more complete knowledge of our universe as a whole. Their\r\naim is to do for the star-system what Darwin did for the organic world, to\r\ndiscover the processes of change that are at work in the heavens, and to\r\nlearn how the mysterious nebulæ, the various types of stars, and the\r\nclusters and systems of stars are related to each other. As Darwin solved\r\nthe problem of the origin of organic species from other species, and thus\r\nenabled us to understand how the whole of the existing forms of life have\r\nbeen developed out of pre-existing forms, so astronomers hope to be able to\r\nsolve the problem of the evolution of suns from some earlier stellar types,\r\nso as to be able, ultimately, to form some intelligible conception of how\r\nthe whole stellar universe has come to be what it is. Volumes have already\r\nbeen written on this subject, and many ingenious suggestions and hypotheses\r\nhave been advanced. But the difficulties are very great; the facts to be\r\nco-ordinated are excessively numerous, and they are necessarily only a\r\nfragment of an unknown whole. Yet certain definite conclusions have been\r\nreached; and the agreement of many independent observers and thinkers on\r\nthe fundamental principles of stellar evolution seems to assure us that we\r\nare progressing, if slowly yet with some established basis of truth,\r\ntowards the solution of this, the most stupendous scientific problem with\r\nwhich the human intellect has ever attempted to grapple.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITY OF THE STELLAR UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the nineteenth century the opinion of astronomers\r\nhas been tending more and more to the conception that the whole of the\r\nvisible universe of stars and nebulæ constitutes one complete and\r\nclosely-related system; and during the last thirty years especially the\r\nvast body of facts accumulated by stellar research has so firmly\r\nestablished this view that it is now hardly questioned by any competent\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the nebulæ were far more remote from us than the stars long\r\nheld sway, even after it had been given up by its chief supporter. When Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel, by means of his then unapproached telescopic power,\r\nresolved the Milky Way more or less completely into stars, and showed that\r\nnumerous objects which had been classed as nebulæ were really clusters of\r\nstars, it was natural to suppose that those which still retained their\r\ncloudy appearance under the highest telescopic powers were also clusters or\r\nsystems of stars, which only needed still higher powers to show their true\r\nnature. This idea was supported by the fact that several nebulæ were found\r\nto be more or less ring-shaped, thus corresponding on a smaller scale to\r\nthe form of the Milky Way; so that when Herschel discovered thousands of\r\ntelescopic nebulæ, he was accustomed to speak of them as so many distinct\r\nuniverses scattered through the immeasurable depths of space.\r\n\r\nNow, although any real conception of the immensity of the one stellar\r\nuniverse, of which the Milky Way with its associated stars is the\r\nfundamental feature, is, as I have shown, almost unattainable, the idea of\r\nan unlimited number of other universes, almost infinitely remote from our\r\nown and yet distinctly visible in the heavens, so seized upon the\r\nimagination that it became almost a commonplace of popular astronomy and\r\nwas not easily given up even by astronomers themselves. And this was in a\r\nlarge part due to the fact that Sir William Herschel's voluminous writings,\r\nbeing almost all in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,\r\nwere very little read, and that he only indicated his change of view by a\r\nfew brief sentences which might easily be overlooked. The late Mr. Proctor\r\nappears to have been the first astronomer to make a thorough study of the\r\nwhole of Herschel's papers, and he tells us that he read them all over five\r\ntimes before he was able thoroughly to grasp the writer's views at\r\ndifferent periods.\r\n\r\nBut the first person to point out the real teaching of the facts as to the\r\ndistribution of the nebulæ was not an astronomer, but our greatest\r\nphilosophical student of science in general, Herbert Spencer. In a\r\nremarkable essay on 'The Nebular Hypothesis' in the _Westminster Review_ of\r\nJuly, 1858, he maintained that the nebulæ really formed a part of our own\r\nGalaxy and of our own stellar universe. A single passage from his paper\r\nwill indicate his line of argument, which, it may be added, had already\r\nbeen partially set forth by Sir John Herschel in his _Outlines of\r\nAstronomy_.\r\n\r\n'If there were but one nebula, it would be a curious coincidence were this\r\none nebula so placed in the distant regions of space as to agree in\r\ndirection with a starless spot in our own sidereal system. If there were\r\nbut two nebulæ, and both were so placed, the coincidence would be\r\nexcessively strange. What, then, shall we say on finding that there are\r\nthousands of nebulæ so placed? Shall we believe that in thousands of cases\r\nthese far-removed galaxies happen to agree in their visible positions with\r\nthe thin places in our own galaxy? Such a belief is impossible.'\r\n\r\nHe then applies the same argument to the distribution of the nebulæ as a\r\nwhole:--'In that zone of celestial space where stars are excessively\r\nabundant, nebulæ are rare, while in the two opposite celestial spaces that\r\nare farthest removed from this zone, nebulæ are abundant. Scarcely any\r\nnebulæ lie near the galactic circle (or plane of the Milky Way); and the\r\ngreat mass of them lie round the galactic poles. Can this also be mere\r\ncoincidence?' And he concludes, from the whole mass of the evidence, that\r\n'the proofs of a physical connection become overwhelming.'\r\n\r\nNothing could be more clear or more forcible; but Spencer not being an\r\nastronomer, and writing in a comparatively little read periodical, the\r\nastronomical world hardly noticed him; and it was from ten to fifteen years\r\nlater, when Mr. R.A. Proctor, by his laborious charts and his various\r\npapers read before the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies from 1869 to\r\n1875, compelled the attention of the scientific world, and thus did more\r\nperhaps than any other man to establish firmly the grand and far-reaching\r\nprinciple of the essential unity of the stellar universe, which is now\r\naccepted by almost every astronomical writer of eminence in the civilised\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE STELLAR UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nAmid the enormous mass of observations and of suggestive speculation upon\r\nthis great and most interesting problem, it is difficult to select what is\r\nmost important and most trustworthy. But the attempt must be made, because,\r\nunless my readers have some knowledge of the most important facts bearing\r\nupon it (besides those already set forth), and also learn something of the\r\ndifficulties that meet the inquirer into causes at every step of his way,\r\nand of the various ideas and suggestions which have been put forth to\r\naccount for the facts and to overcome the difficulties, they will not be in\r\na position to estimate, however imperfectly, the grandeur, the marvel, and\r\nthe mystery of the vast and highly complex universe in which we live and of\r\nwhich we are an important, perhaps the most important, if not the only\r\npermanent outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN A TYPICAL STAR\r\n\r\nIt being now a recognised fact that the stars are suns, some knowledge of\r\nour own sun is an essential preliminary to an inquiry into their nature,\r\nand into the probable changes they have undergone.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the sun's density is only one-fourth that of the earth, or\r\nless than one and a half times that of water, demonstrates that it cannot\r\nbe solid, since the force of gravity at its surface being twenty-six and a\r\nhalf times that at the earth's surface, the materials of a solid globe\r\nwould be so compressed that the resulting density would be at least twenty\r\ntimes greater instead of four times less than that of the earth. All the\r\nevidence goes to show that the body of the sun is really gaseous, but so\r\ncompressed by its gravitative force as to behave more like a liquid. A few\r\nfigures as to the vast dimensions of the sun and the amount of light and\r\nheat emitted by it will enable us better to understand the phenomena it\r\npresents, and the interpretation of those phenomena.\r\n\r\nProctor estimated that each square inch of the sun's surface emitted as\r\nmuch light as twenty-five electric arcs; and Professor Langley has shown by\r\nexperiment that the sun is 5300 times brighter, and eighty-seven times\r\nhotter than the white-hot metal in a Bessemer converter. The actual amount\r\nof solar heat received by the earth is sufficient, if wholly utilised, to\r\nkeep a three-horse-power engine continually at work on every square yard of\r\nthe surface of our globe. The size of the sun is such, that if the earth\r\nwere at its centre, not only would there be ample space for the moon's\r\norbit, but sufficient for another satellite 190,000 miles beyond the moon,\r\nall revolving inside the sun. The mass of matter in the sun is 745 times\r\ngreater than that of all the planets combined; hence the powerful\r\ngravitative force by which they are retained in their distant orbits.\r\n\r\nWhat we see as the sun's surface is the photosphere or outer layer of\r\ngaseous or partially liquid matter kept at a definite level by the power of\r\ngravitation. The photosphere has a granular texture implying some diversity\r\nof surface or of luminosity; although the even contour of the sun's margin\r\nshows that these irregularities are not on a very large scale. This surface\r\nis apparently rent asunder by what are termed sun-spots, which were long\r\nsupposed to be cavities, showing a dark interior; but are now thought to be\r\ndue to downpours of cooled materials driven out from the sun, and forming\r\nthe prominences seen during solar eclipses. They appear to be black, but\r\naround their margin is a shaded border or penumbra formed of elongated\r\nshining patches crossing and over-lapping, something like heaps of straw.\r\nSometimes brilliant portions overhang the dark spots, and often completely\r\nbridge them over; and similar patches, called faculæ, accompany spots, and\r\nin some cases almost surround them.\r\n\r\nSun-spots are sometimes numerous on the sun's disc, sometimes very few,\r\nand they are of such enormous size that when present they can easily be\r\nseen with the naked eye, protected by a piece of smoked glass; or, better\r\nstill, with an ordinary opera-glass similarly protected. They are found to\r\nincrease in number for several years, and then to decrease; the maxima\r\nrecurring after an average period of eleven years, but with no exactness,\r\nsince the interval between two maxima or minima is sometimes only nine and\r\nsometimes as much as thirteen years; while the minima do not occur midway\r\nbetween two maxima, but much nearer to the succeeding than to the preceding\r\none. What is more interesting is, that variations in terrestrial magnetism\r\nfollow them with great accuracy; while violent commotions in the sun,\r\nindicated by the sudden appearance of faculæ, sun-spots, or prominences on\r\nthe sun's limb, are always accompanied by magnetic disturbances on the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SURROUNDS THE SUN\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that what we commonly term the sun is really the\r\nbright spherical nucleus of a nebulous body. This nucleus consists of\r\nmatter in the gaseous state, but so compressed as to resemble a liquid or\r\neven a viscous fluid. About forty of the elements have been detected in the\r\nsun by means of the dark lines in its spectrum, but it is almost certain\r\nthat all the elements, in some form or other, exist there. This semi-liquid\r\nglowing surface is termed the photosphere, since from it are given out the\r\nlight and heat which reach our earth.\r\n\r\nImmediately above this luminous surface is what is termed the 'reversing\r\nlayer' or absorbing layer, consisting of dense metallic vapours only a few\r\nhundred miles thick, and, though glowing, somewhat cooler than the surface\r\nof the photosphere. Its spectrum, taken, at the moment when the sun is\r\ntotally darkened, through a slit which is directed tangentially to the\r\nsun's limb, shows a mass of bright lines corresponding in a large degree to\r\nthe dark lines in the ordinary solar spectrum. It is thus shown to be a\r\nvaporous stratum which absorbs the special rays emitted by each element and\r\nforming its characteristic coloured lines, changing them into black lines.\r\nBut as coloured lines are not found in this layer corresponding to all the\r\nblack lines in the solar spectrum, it is now held that special absorption\r\nmust also occur in the chromosphere and perhaps in the corona itself. Sir\r\nNorman Lockyer, in his volume on _Inorganic Evolution_, even goes so far as\r\nto say, that the true 'reversing layer' of the sun--that which by its\r\nabsorption produced the dark lines in the solar spectrum--is now shown to\r\nbe _not_ the chromosphere itself but a layer above it, of lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nAbove the reversing layer comes the chromosphere, a vast mass of rosy or\r\nscarlet emanations surrounding the sun to a depth of about 4000 miles. When\r\nseen during eclipses it shows a serrated waving outline, but subject to\r\ngreat changes of form, producing the prominences already mentioned. These\r\nare of two kinds: the 'quiescent,' which are something like clouds of\r\nenormous extent, and which keep their forms for a considerable time; and\r\nthe 'eruptive,' which shoot out in towering tree-like flames or\r\ngeyser-like eruptions, and while doing so have been proved to reach\r\nvelocities of over 300 miles a second, and subside again with almost equal\r\nrapidity. The chromosphere and its quiescent prominences appear to be truly\r\ngaseous, consisting of hydrogen, helium, and coronium, while the eruptive\r\nprominences always show the presence of metallic vapours, especially of\r\ncalcium. Prominences increase in size and number in close accordance with\r\nthe increase of sun-spots. Beyond the red chromosphere and prominences is\r\nthe marvellous white glory of the corona, which extends to an enormous\r\ndistance round the sun. Like the prominences of the chromosphere, it is\r\nsubject to periodical changes in form and size, corresponding to the\r\nsun-spot period, but in inverse order, a minimum of sun-spots going with a\r\nmaximum extension of the corona. At the total eclipse of July 1878, when\r\nthe sun's surface was almost wholly clear, a pair of enormous equatorial\r\nstreamers stretched east and west of the sun to a distance of ten millions\r\nof miles, and less extensions of the corona occurred at the poles. At the\r\neclipses of 1882 and 1883, on the other hand, when sun-spots were at a\r\nmaximum, the corona was regularly stellate with no great extensions, but of\r\nhigh brilliancy. This correspondence has been noted at every eclipse, and\r\nthere is therefore an undoubted connection between the two phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe light of the corona is believed to be derived from three sources--from\r\nincandescent solid or liquid particles thrown out from the sun, from\r\nsunlight reflected from these particles, and from gaseous emissions. Its\r\nspectrum possesses a green ray, which is peculiar to it, and is supposed to\r\nindicate a gas named 'coronium'; in other respects the spectrum is more\r\nlike that of reflected sunlight. The enormous extensions of the corona into\r\ngreat angular streamers seem to indicate electrical repulsive forces\r\nanalogous to those which produce the tails of comets.\r\n\r\nConnected with the sun's corona is that strange phenomenon, the zodiacal\r\nlight. This is a delicate nebulosity, which is often seen after sunset in\r\nspring and before sunrise in autumn, tapering upwards from the sun's\r\ndirection along the plane of the ecliptic. Under very favourable conditions\r\nit has been traced in the eastern sky in spring to 180° from the sun's\r\nposition, indicating that it extends beyond the earth's orbit.\r\nLong-continued observations from the summit of the Pic du Midi show that\r\nthis is really the case, and that it lies almost exactly in the plane of\r\nthe sun's equator. It is therefore held to be produced by the minute\r\nparticles thrown off the sun, through those coronal wings and streamers\r\nwhich are visible only during solar eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe careful study of the solar phenomena has very clearly established the\r\nfact that none of the sun's envelopes, from the reversing layer to the\r\ncorona itself, is in any sense an atmosphere. The combination of enormous\r\ngravitative force with an amount of heat which turns all the elements into\r\nthe liquid or gaseous state, leads to consequences which it is difficult\r\nfor us to follow or comprehend. There is evidently constant internal\r\nmovement or circulation in the interior of the sun, resulting in the\r\nfaculæ, the sun-spots, the intensely luminous photosphere, and the\r\nchromosphere with its vast flaming coruscations and eruptive protuberances.\r\nBut it seems impossible that this incessant and violent movement can be\r\nkept up without some great and periodical or continuous inrush of fresh\r\nmaterials to renew the heat, keep up the internal circulation, and supply\r\nthe waste. Perhaps the movement of the sun through space may bring him into\r\ncontact with sufficiently large masses of matter to continually excite that\r\ninternal movement without which the exterior surface would rapidly become\r\ncool and all planetary life cease. The various solar envelopes are the\r\nresult of this internal agitation, uprushes, and explosions, while the vast\r\nwhite corona is probably of little more density than comets' tails,\r\nprobably even of less density, since comets not unfrequently rush through\r\nits midst without suffering any loss of velocity. The fact that none of the\r\nsolar envelopes are visible to us until the light of the photosphere is\r\ncompletely shut off, and that they all vanish the very instant the first\r\ngleam of direct sunlight reaches us, is another proof of their extreme\r\ntenuity, as is also the sharply defined edge of the sun's disc. The\r\nenvelopes therefore consist partly of liquid or vaporous matter, in a very\r\nfinely divided state, driven off by explosions or by electrical forces, and\r\nthis matter, rapidly cooling, becomes solidified into minutest particles,\r\nor even physical molecules. Much of this matter continually falls back on\r\nthe sun's surface, but a certain quantity of the very finest dust is\r\ncontinually driven away by electrical repulsion, so as to form the corona\r\nand the zodiacal light. The vast coronal streamers and the still more\r\nextensive ring of the zodiacal light are therefore in all probability due\r\nto the same causes, and have a similar physical constitution with the tails\r\nof comets.\r\n\r\nAs the whole of our sunlight must pass through both the reversing layer and\r\nthe red chromosphere, its colour must be somewhat modified by them. Hence\r\nit is believed that, if they were absent, not only would the light and heat\r\nof the sun be considerably greater, but its colour would be a purer white,\r\ntending towards bluish rather than towards the yellowish tinge it actually\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULAR AND METEORITIC HYPOTHESES\r\n\r\nAs the constitution of the sun, and its agency in producing magnetism and\r\nelectricity in the matter and orbs around it, afford us our best guide to\r\nthe constitution of the stars and nebulæ, and to their possible action on\r\neach other, and even upon our earth, so the mode of evolution of the sun\r\nand solar system, from some pre-existing condition, is likely to help us\r\ntowards gaining some knowledge of the constitution of the stellar universe\r\nand the processes of change going on there.\r\n\r\nAt the very commencement of the nineteenth century the great mathematician\r\nLaplace published his Nebular Theory of the Origin of the Solar System; and\r\nalthough he put it forth merely as a suggestion, and did not support it\r\nwith any numerical or physical data, or by any mathematical processes, his\r\ngreat reputation, and its apparent probability and simplicity, caused it to\r\nbe almost universally accepted, and to be extended so as to apply to the\r\nevolution of the stellar universe. This theory, very briefly stated, is,\r\nthat the whole of the matter of the solar system once formed a globular or\r\nspheroidal mass of intensely heated gases, extending beyond the orbit of\r\nthe outermost planet, and having a slow motion of revolution about an axis.\r\nAs it cooled and contracted, its rate of revolution increased, and this\r\nbecame so great that at successive epochs it threw off rings, which, owing\r\nto slight irregularities, broke up, and, gravitating together, formed the\r\nplanets. The contraction continuing, the sun, as we now see it, was the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nFor about half a century this nebular hypothesis was generally accepted,\r\nbut during the last thirty years so many objections and difficulties have\r\nbeen suggested, that it has been felt impossible to retain it even as a\r\nworking hypothesis. At the same time another hypothesis has been put forth\r\nwhich seems more in accordance with the facts of nature as we find them in\r\nour own solar system, and which is not open to any of the objections\r\nagainst the nebular theory, even if it introduces a few new ones.\r\n\r\nA fundamental objection to Laplace's theory is, that in a gas of such\r\nextreme tenuity as the solar nebula must have been, even when it extended\r\nonly to Saturn or Uranus, it could not possibly have had any cohesion, and\r\ntherefore could not have given off whole rings at distant intervals, but\r\nonly small fragments continuously as condensation went on, and these,\r\nrapidly cooling, would form solid particles, a kind of meteoric dust, which\r\nmight aggregate into numerous small planets, or might persist for\r\nindefinite periods, like the rings of Saturn or the great ring of the\r\nAsteroids.\r\n\r\nAnother equally vital objection is, that, as the nebula when extending\r\nbeyond the orbit of Neptune could have had a mean density of only about the\r\ntwo-hundred millionth of our air at sea level, it must have been many\r\nhundred times less dense than this at and near its outer surface, and would\r\nthere be exposed to the cold of stellar space--a cold that would solidify\r\nhydrogen. It is thus evident that the gases of all the metallic and other\r\nsolid elements could not possibly exist as such, but would rapidly, perhaps\r\nalmost instantaneously, become first liquid and then solid, forming\r\nmeteoric dust even before contraction had gone far enough to produce such\r\nincreased rotation as would throw off any portion of the gaseous matter.\r\n\r\nHere we have the foundations of the meteoritic hypothesis which is now\r\nsteadily making its way. It is supported by the fact that we everywhere\r\nfind proofs of such solid matter in the planetary spaces around us. It\r\nfalls continually upon the earth. It can be collected on the Arctic and\r\nAlpine snows. It occurs everywhere in the deepest abysses of the ocean\r\nwhere there are not sufficient organic deposits to mask it. It constitutes,\r\nas has now been demonstrated, the rings of Saturn. Thousands of vast rings\r\nof solid particles circulate around the sun, and when our earth crosses any\r\nof these rings, and their particles enter our atmosphere with planetary\r\nvelocity, the friction ignites them and we see falling stars. Comets'\r\ntails, the sun's corona, and the zodiacal light are three strange\r\nphenomena, which, though wholly insoluble on any theory of gaseous\r\nformation, receive their intelligible explanation by means of excessively\r\nminute solid particles--microscopic cosmic dust--driven outward by the\r\ntremendous electrical repulsions that emanate from the sun.\r\n\r\nHaving these and other proofs that solid matter, ranging in size, perhaps,\r\nfrom the majestic orbs of Jupiter and Saturn down to the inconceivably\r\nminute particles driven millions of miles into space to form a comet's\r\ntail, does actually exist everywhere around us, and by collisions between\r\nthe particles or with planetary atmospheres can produce heat and light and\r\ngaseous emanations, we find a basis of fact and observation for the\r\nmeteoritic hypothesis which Laplace's nebular, and essentially gaseous,\r\ntheory does not possess.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the nineteenth century several writers suggested\r\nthis idea of the possible formation of the Solar System, but so far as I am\r\naware, the late R.A. Proctor was the first to discuss it in any detail, and\r\nto show that it explained many of the peculiarities in the size and\r\narrangement of the planets and their satellites which the nebular\r\nhypothesis did not explain. This he does at some length in the chapter on\r\nmeteors and comets in his _Other Worlds than Ours_, published in 1870. He\r\nassumed, instead of the fire-mist of Laplace, that the space now occupied\r\nby the solar system, and for an unknown distance around it, was occupied by\r\nvast quantities of solid particles of all the kinds of matter which we now\r\nfind in the earth, sun, and stars. This matter was dispersed somewhat\r\nirregularly, as we see that all the matter of the universe is now\r\ndistributed; and he further assumed that it was all in motion, as we now\r\nknow that all the stars and other cosmical masses are, and must be, in\r\nmotion towards or around some centre.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, wherever the matter was most aggregated, there\r\nwould be a centre of attraction through gravitation, which would\r\nnecessarily lead to further aggregation, and the continual impacts of such\r\naggregating matter would produce heat. In course of time, if the supply of\r\ncosmic matter was ample (as the result shows that it must have been,\r\nwhatever theory we adopt), our sun, thus formed, would approximate to its\r\npresent mass and acquire sufficient heat by collision and gravitation to\r\nconvert its whole body into the liquid or gaseous condition. While this was\r\ngoing on, subordinate centres of aggregation might form, which would\r\ncapture a certain proportion of the matter flowing in under the attraction\r\nof the central mass, while, owing to the nearly uniform direction and\r\nvelocity with which the whole system was revolving, each subordinate centre\r\nwould revolve around the central mass, in somewhat different planes, but\r\nall in the same direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor shows the probability that the largest outside aggregation\r\nwould be at a great distance from the central mass, and this having once\r\nbeen formed, any centres farther away from the sun would be both smaller\r\nand very remote, while those inside the first would, as a rule, become\r\nsmaller as they were nearer the centre. The heated condition of the earth's\r\ninterior would thus be due, not to the primitive heat of matter in a\r\ngaseous state out of which it was formed--a condition physically\r\nimpossible--but would be acquired in the process of aggregation by the\r\ncollisions of meteoric masses falling on it, and by its own gravitative\r\nforce producing continuous condensation and heat.\r\n\r\nOn this view Jupiter would probably be formed first, and after him at very\r\ngreat distances, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; while the inner aggregations\r\nwould be smaller, as the much greater attractive power of the sun would\r\ngive them comparatively little opportunity of capturing the meteoric matter\r\nthat was continuously flowing towards him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METEORITIC NATURE OF THE NEBULÆ\r\n\r\nHaving thus reached the conclusion that wherever apparently nebulous matter\r\nexists within the limits of the solar system it is not gaseous but consists\r\nof solid particles, or, if heated gases are associated with the solid\r\nmatter they can be accounted for by the heat due to collisions either with\r\nother solid particles or with accumulations of gases at a low temperature,\r\nas when meteorites enter our atmosphere, it was an easy step to consider\r\nwhether the cosmic nebulæ and stars may not have had a similar origin.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the nebulæ are supposed to be vast aggregations of\r\nmeteorites or cosmic dust, or of the more persistent gases, revolving with\r\ncircular or spiral motions, or in irregular streams, and so sparsely\r\nscattered that the separate particles of dust may be miles--perhaps\r\nhundreds of miles--apart; yet even those nebulæ, only visible by the\r\ntelescope, may contain as much matter as the whole solar system. From this\r\nsimple origin, by steps which can be observed in the skies, almost all the\r\nforms of suns and systems can be traced by means of the known laws of\r\nmotion, of heat-production, and of chemical action. The chief English\r\nadvocate of this view at the present time is Sir Norman Lockyer, who, in\r\nnumerous papers, and in his works on _The Meteoritic Hypothesis_ and\r\n_Inorganic Evolution_, has developed it in detail, as the result of many\r\nyears' continuous research, aided by the contributory work of continental\r\nand American astronomers. These views are gradually spreading among\r\nastronomers and mathematicians, as will be seen by the very brief outline\r\nwhich will now be given of the explanations they afford of the main groups\r\nof phenomena presented by the stellar universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. ROBERTS ON SPIRAL NEBULÆ\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Roberts, who possesses one of the finest telescopes constructed\r\nfor photographing stars and nebulæ, has given his views on stellar\r\nevolution, in _Knowledge_ of February 1897, illustrated by four beautiful\r\nphotographs of spiral nebulæ. These curious forms were at first thought to\r\nbe rare, but are now found to be really very numerous when details are\r\nbrought out by the camera. Many of the very large and apparently quite\r\nirregular nebulæ, like the Magellanic Clouds, are found to have faint\r\nindications of spiral structure. As more than ten thousand nebulæ are now\r\nknown, and new ones are continually being discovered, it will be a long\r\ntime before these can all be carefully studied and photographed, but\r\npresent indications seem to show that a considerable proportion of them\r\nwill exhibit spiral forms.\r\n\r\nDr. Roberts tells us that all the spiral nebulæ he has photographed are\r\ncharacterised by having a nucleus surrounded by dense nebulosity, most of\r\nthem being also studded with stars. These stars are always arranged more or\r\nless symmetrically, following the curves of the spiral, while outside the\r\nvisible nebula are other stars arranged in curves strongly suggesting a\r\nformer greater extension of the nebulous matter. This is so marked a\r\nfeature that it at once leads to a possible explanation of the numerous\r\nslightly curved lines of stars found in every part of the heavens, as being\r\nthe result of their origin from spiral nebulæ whose material substance has\r\nbeen absorbed by them.\r\n\r\nDr. Roberts proposes several problems in relation to these bodies: Of what\r\nmaterials are spiral nebulæ composed? Whence comes the vortical motion\r\nwhich has produced their forms? The material he finds in those faint clouds\r\nof nebulous matter, often of vast extent, that exist in many parts of the\r\nsky, and these are so numerous that Sir William Herschel alone recorded the\r\npositions of fifty-two such regions, many of which have been confirmed by\r\nrecent photographs. Dr. Roberts considers these to be either gaseous or\r\nwith discrete solid particles intermixed. He also enumerates smaller\r\nnebulous masses undergoing condensation and segregation into more regular\r\nforms; spiral nebulæ in various stages of condensation and of aggregation;\r\nelliptic nebulæ; and globular nebulæ. In the last three classes there is\r\nclear evidence, on every photograph that has been taken, that condensation\r\ninto stars or star like forms is now going on.\r\n\r\nHe adopts Sir Norman Lockyer's view that collisions of meteorites within\r\neach swarm or cloud would produce luminous nebulosity; so also would\r\ncollisions between separate swarms of meteorites produce the conditions\r\nrequired to account for the vortical motions and the peculiar distribution\r\nof the nebulosity in the spiral nebulæ. Almost any collision between\r\nunequal masses of diffused matter would, in the absence of any massive\r\ncentral body round which they would be forced to revolve, lead to spiral\r\nmotions. It is to be noted that, although the stars formed in the spiral\r\nconvolutions of the nebulæ follow those curves, and retain them after the\r\nnebulous matter has been all absorbed by them, yet, whenever such a nebula\r\nis seen by us edgewise, the convolutions with their enclosed stars will\r\nappear as straight lines; and thus not only numbers of star groups arranged\r\nin curves, but also those which form almost perfect straight lines, may\r\npossibly be traced back to an origin from spiral nebulæ.\r\n\r\nMotion being a necessary result of gravitation, we know that every star,\r\nplanet, comet, or nebula must be in motion through space, and these\r\nmotions--except in systems physically connected or which have had a common\r\norigin--are, apparently, in all directions. How these motions originated\r\nand are now regulated we do not know; but there they are, and they furnish\r\nthe motive power of the collisions, which, when affecting large bodies or\r\nmasses of diffused matter, lead to the formation of the various kinds of\r\npermanent stars; while when smaller masses of matter are concerned those\r\ntemporary stars are formed which have interested astronomers in all ages.\r\nIt must be noted that although the motions of the single stars appear to be\r\nin straight lines, yet the spaces through which they have been observed to\r\nmove are so small that they may really be moving in curved orbits around\r\nsome central body, or the centre of gravity of some aggregation of stars\r\nbright and dark, which may itself be comparatively at rest. There may be\r\nthousands of such centres around us, and this may sufficiently explain the\r\napparent motions of stars in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUGGESTION AS TO THE FORMATION OF SPIRAL NEBULÆ\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable paper in the Astrophysical Journal (July 1901), Mr. T.C.\r\nChamberlin suggests an origin for the spiral nebulæ, as well as of swarms\r\nof meteorites and comets, which seems likely to be a true, although perhaps\r\nnot the only one.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known principle which shows that when two bodies in space,\r\nof stellar size, pass within a certain distance of each other, the smaller\r\none will be liable to be torn into fragments by the differential attraction\r\nof the larger and denser body. This was originally proved in the case of\r\ngaseous and liquid bodies, and the distance within which the smaller one\r\nwill be disrupted (termed the Roche limit) is calculated on the supposition\r\nthat the disrupted body is a liquid mass. Mr. Chamberlin shows, however,\r\nthat a solid body will also be disrupted at a lesser distance dependent on\r\nits size and cohesive strength; but, as the size of the two bodies\r\nincreases, the distance at which disruption will occur increases also, till\r\nwith very large bodies, such as suns, it becomes almost as large as in the\r\ncase of liquids or gases.\r\n\r\nThe disruption occurs from the well-known law of differential gravitation\r\non the two sides of a body leading to tidal deformation in a liquid, and to\r\nunequal strain in a solid. When the changes of gravitative force take place\r\nslowly, and are also small in amount, the tides in liquids or strains in\r\nsolids are very small, as in the case of our earth when acted on by the sun\r\nand moon, the result is a small tide in the ocean and atmosphere, and no\r\ndoubt also in the molten interior, to which the comparatively thin crust\r\nmay partially adjust itself. But if we suppose two dark or luminous suns\r\nwhose proper motions are in such a direction as to bring them near each\r\nother, then, as they approach, each will be deflected towards the other,\r\nand will pass round their common centre of gravity with immense velocity,\r\nperhaps hundreds of miles in a second. At a considerable distance they will\r\nbegin to produce tidal elongation towards and away from each other, but\r\nwhen the disruptive limit is nearly reached, the gravitative forces will be\r\nincreasing so rapidly that even a liquid mass could not adjust its shape\r\nwith sufficient quickness and the tremendous internal strains would produce\r\nthe effects of an explosion, tearing the whole mass (of the smaller of the\r\ntwo) into fragments and dust.\r\n\r\nBut it is also shown that, during the entire process, the two elongated\r\nportions of the originally spherical mass would be so acted upon by\r\ngravity as to produce increasing rotation, which as the crisis approached\r\nwould extend the elongation, and aid in the explosive result. This rapid\r\nrotation of the elongated mass would, when the disruption occurred,\r\nnecessarily give to the fragments a whirling or spiral motion, and thus\r\ninitiate a spiral nebula of a size and character dependent on the size and\r\nconstitution of the two masses, and on the amount of the explosive forces\r\nset up by their approach.\r\n\r\nThere is one very suggestive phenomenon which seems to prove that this _is_\r\none of the modes of formation of spiral nebulæ. When the explosive\r\ndisruption occurs the two protuberances or elongations of the body will fly\r\napart, and having also a rapid rotatory movement, the resulting spiral will\r\nnecessarily be a double one. Now, it is the fact that almost all the\r\nwell-developed spiral nebulæ have two such arms opposite to each other, as\r\nbeautifully shown in M. 100 Comæ, M. 51 Canum, and others photographed by\r\nDr. I. Roberts. It does not seem likely that any other origin of these\r\nnebulæ should give rise to a double rather than to a single spiral.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF DOUBLE STARS\r\n\r\nThe advance in knowledge of double and multiple stars has been wonderfully\r\nrapid, numerous observers having devoted themselves to this special branch.\r\nMany thousands were discovered during the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and as telescopic power increased new ones continued to flow in by\r\nhundreds and thousands, and there has been recently published by the\r\nYerkes Observatory a catalogue of 1290 such stars, discovered between 1871\r\nand 1899 by one observer, Mr. S.W. Burnham. All these have been found by\r\nthe use of the telescope, but during the last quarter of a century the\r\nspectroscope has opened up a new world of double stars of enormous extent\r\nand the highest interest.\r\n\r\nThe telescopic binaries which have been observed for a sufficient time to\r\ndetermine their orbits, range from periods of about eleven years as a\r\nminimum up to hundreds and even more than a thousand years. But the\r\nspectroscope reveals the fact that the many thousands of telescopic\r\nbinaries form only a very small part of the binary systems in existence.\r\nThe overwhelming importance of this discovery is, that it carries the times\r\nof revolution from the minimum of the telescopic doubles downward in\r\nunbroken series through periods of a few years, to those reckoned by\r\nmonths, by days, and even by hours. And with this reduction of period there\r\nnecessarily follows a corresponding reduction of distance, so that\r\nsometimes the two stars must be in contact, and thus the actual birth or\r\norigin of a double star has been observed to occur, even though not\r\nactually seen. This mode of origin was indeed anticipated by Dr. Lee of\r\nChicago in 1892, and it has been confirmed by observation in the short\r\nspace of ten years.\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable communication to _Nature_ (September 12th, 1901) Mr.\r\nAlexander W. Roberts of Lovedale, South Africa, gives some of the main\r\nresults of this branch of inquiry. Of course all the variable stars are to\r\nbe found among the spectroscopic binaries. They consist of that portion of\r\nthe class in which the plane of the orbit is directed towards us, so that\r\nduring their revolution one of the pair either wholly or partially eclipses\r\nthe other. In some of these cases there are irregularities, such as double\r\nmaxima and minima of unequal lengths, which may be due to triple systems or\r\nto other causes not yet explained, but as they all have short periods and\r\nalways appear as one star in the most powerful telescopes, they form a\r\nspecial division of the spectroscopic binary systems.\r\n\r\nThere are known at present twenty-two variables of the Algol type, that is,\r\nstars having each a dark companion very close to it which obscures it\r\neither wholly or partially during every revolution. In these cases the\r\ndensity of the systems can be approximately determined, and they are found\r\nto be, on the average, only one-fifth that of water, or one-eighth that of\r\nour sun. But as many of them are as large as our sun, or even considerably\r\nlarger, it is evident that they must be wholly gaseous, and, even if very\r\nhot, of a less complex constitution than our luminary. Mr. A.W. Roberts\r\ntells us that five out of these twenty-two variables revolve _in absolute\r\ncontact_ forming systems of the shape of a dumb-bell. The periods vary from\r\ntwelve days to less than nine hours; and, starting from these, we now have\r\na continuous series of lengthening periods up to the twin stars of Castor\r\nwhich require more than a thousand years to complete their revolution.\r\n\r\nDuring his observations of the above five stars, Mr. Roberts states that\r\none, X Carinæ, was found to have parted company, so that instead of being\r\nactually united to its companion the two are now at a distance apart equal\r\nto one-tenth of their diameters, and he may thus be said to have been\r\nalmost a witness of the birth of a stellar system.\r\n\r\nA year later we find the record (in _Knowledge_, October 1902) of Professor\r\nCampbell's researches at the Lick Observatory. He states that, out of 350\r\nstars observed spectroscopically, one in eight is a spectroscopic binary;\r\nand so impressed is he with their abundance that, as accuracy of\r\nmeasurement increases, he believes that _the star that is not a\r\nspectroscopic binary will prove to be the rare exception_! Professor G.\r\nDarwin had already shown that the 'dumb-bell' was a figure of equilibrium\r\nin a rotating mass of fluid; and we now find proofs that such figures\r\nexist, and that they form the starting-point for the enormous and\r\never-increasing quantities of spectroscopic binary star-systems that are\r\nnow known. The origin of these binary stars is also of especial interest as\r\ngiving support to Professor Darwin's well-known explanation of the origin\r\nof the moon by disruption from the earth, owing to the very rapid rotation\r\nof the parent planet. It now appears that suns often subdivide in the same\r\nmanner, but, owing perhaps to their intensely heated gaseous state they\r\nseem usually to form nearly equal globes. The evolution of this special\r\nform of star-system is therefore now an observed fact; though it by no\r\nmeans follows that all double stars have had the same mode of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUSTERS OF STARS AND VARIABLES\r\n\r\nThe clusters of stars, which are tolerably abundant in the heavens and\r\noffer so many strange and beautiful forms to the telescopist, are yet\r\namong the most puzzling phenomena the philosophic astronomer has to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nMany of these clusters which are not very crowded and of irregular forms,\r\nstrongly suggest an origin from the equally irregular and fantastic forms\r\nof nebulæ by a process of aggregation like that which Dr. Roberts describes\r\nas developing within the spiral nebulæ. But the dense globular clusters\r\nwhich form such beautiful telescopic objects, and in some of which more\r\nthan six thousand stars have been counted besides considerable numbers so\r\ncrowded in the centre as to be uncountable, are more difficult to explain.\r\nOne of the problems suggested by these clusters is as to their stability.\r\nProfessor Simon Newcomb remarks on this point as follows: 'Where thousands\r\nof stars are condensed into a space so small, what prevents them from all\r\nfalling together into one confused mass? Are they really doing so, and will\r\nthey ultimately form a single body? These are questions which can be\r\nsatisfactorily answered only by centuries of observation; they must\r\ntherefore be left to the astronomers of the future.'\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some remarkable features in these clusters which afford\r\npossible indications of their origin and essential constitution. When\r\nclosely examined most of them are seen to be less regular than they at\r\nfirst appear. Vacant spaces can be noted in them; even rifts of definite\r\nforms. In some there is a radiated structure; in others there are curved\r\nappendages; while some have fainter centres. These features are so exactly\r\nlike what are found, in a more pronounced form, in the larger nebulæ, that\r\nwe can hardly help thinking that in these clusters we have the result of\r\nthe condensation of very large nebulæ, which have first aggregated towards\r\nnumerous centres, while these agglomerations have been slowly drawn towards\r\nthe common centre of gravity of the whole mass. It is suggestive of this\r\norigin that while the smaller telescopic nebulæ are far removed from the\r\nMilky Way, the larger ones are most abundant near its borders; while the\r\nstar-clusters are excessively abundant on and near the Milky Way, but very\r\nscarce elsewhere, except in or near vast nebulæ like the Magellanic Clouds.\r\nWe thus see that the two phenomena may be complementary to each other, the\r\ncondensation of nebulæ having gone on most rapidly where material was most\r\nabundant, resulting in numerous star-clusters where there are now few\r\nnebulæ.\r\n\r\nThere is one striking feature of the globular clusters which calls for\r\nnotice; the presence in some of them of enormous quantities of variable\r\nstars, while in others few or none can be found. The Harvard Observatory\r\nhas for several years devoted much time to this class of observations, and\r\nthe results are given in Professor Newcomb's recent volume on 'The Stars.'\r\nIt appears that twenty-three clusters have been observed spectroscopically,\r\nthe number of stars examined in each cluster varying from 145 up to 3000,\r\nthe total number of stars thus minutely tested being 19,050. Out of this\r\ntotal number 509 were found to be variable; but the curious fact is, the\r\nextreme divergence in the proportion of variables to the whole number\r\nexamined in the several clusters. In two clusters, though 1279 stars were\r\nexamined, not a single variable was found. In three others the proportion\r\nwas from one in 1050 to one in 500. Five more ranged up to one in 100, and\r\nthe remainder showed from that proportion up to one in seven, 900 stars\r\nbeing examined in the last mentioned cluster of which 132 were variable!\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that variable stars form only a portion, and necessarily a\r\nvery small proportion, of binary systems of stars, it follows that in all\r\nthe clusters which show a large proportion of variables, a very much larger\r\nproportion--in some cases perhaps all, must be double or multiple stars\r\nrevolving round each other. With this remarkable evidence, in addition to\r\nthat adduced for the prevalence of double stars and variables among the\r\nstars in general, we can understand Professor Newcomb adding his testimony\r\nto that of Professor Campbell already quoted, that 'it is probable that\r\namong the stars in general, single stars are the exception rather than the\r\nrule. If such be the case, the rule should hold yet more strongly among the\r\nstars of a condensed cluster.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE STARS\r\n\r\nSo long as astronomers were limited to the use of the telescope only, or\r\neven the still greater powers of the photographic plate, nothing could be\r\nlearnt of the actual constitution of the stars or of the process of their\r\nevolution. Their apparent magnitudes, their movements, and even the\r\ndistances of a few could be determined; while the diversity of their\r\ncolours offered the only clue (a very imperfect one) even to their\r\ntemperature. But the discovery of spectrum analysis has furnished the means\r\nof obtaining some definite knowledge of the physics and chemistry of the\r\nstars, and has thus established a new branch ofscience--Astrophysics--which\r\nhas already attained large proportions, and which furnishes the materials\r\nfor a periodical and some important volumes. This branch of the subject\r\nis very complex, and as it is not directly connected with our present\r\ninquiry, it is only referred to again in order to introduce such of its\r\nresults as bear upon the question of the classification and evolution\r\nof the stars.\r\n\r\nBy a long series of laboratory experiments it has been shown that numerous\r\nchanges occur in the spectra of the elements when subjected to different\r\ntemperatures, ranging upwards to the highest attainable by means of a\r\nbattery producing an electric spark several feet long. These changes are\r\nnot in the relative position of the bands or dark lines, but in their\r\nnumber, breadth, and intensity. Other changes are due to the density of the\r\nmedium in which the elements are heated, and to their chemical condition as\r\nto purity; and from these various modifications and their comparison with\r\nthe solar spectrum and those of its appendages, it has become possible to\r\ndetermine, from the spectrum of a star, not only its temperature as\r\ncompared with that of the electric spark and of the sun, but also its place\r\nin a developmental series.\r\n\r\nThe first general result obtained by this research is, that the bluish\r\nwhite or pure white stars, having a spectrum extending far towards the\r\nviolet end, and which exhibits the coloured bands of gases only, usually\r\nhydrogen and helium, are the hottest. Next come those with a shorter\r\nspectrum not extending so far towards the violet end, and whose light is\r\ntherefore more yellow in tint. To this group our sun belongs; and they are\r\nall characterised like it by dark lines due to absorption, and by the\r\npresence of metals, especially iron, in a gaseous state. The third group\r\nhave the shortest spectra and are of a red colour, while their spectra\r\ncontain lines denoting the presence of carbon. These three groups are often\r\nspoken of as 'gaseous stars,' 'metallic stars,' and 'carbon stars.' Other\r\nastronomers call the first group 'Sirian stars,' because Sirius, though not\r\nthe hottest, is a characteristic type; the second being termed 'solar\r\nstars'; others again speak of them as stars of Class I., Class II., etc.,\r\naccording to the system of classification they have adopted. It was soon\r\nperceived, however, that neither the colour nor the temperature of stars\r\ngave much information as to their nature and state of development, because,\r\nunless we supposed the stars to begin their lives already intensely hot\r\n(and all the evidence is against this), there must be a period during which\r\nheat increases, then one of maximum heat, followed by one of cooling and\r\nfinal loss of light altogether. The meteoritic theory of the origin of all\r\nluminous bodies in the heavens, now very widely adopted, has been used, as\r\nwe have seen, to explain the development of stars from nebulæ, and its\r\nchief exponent in this country, Sir Norman Lockyer, has propounded a\r\ncomplete scheme of stellar evolution and decay which may be here briefly\r\noutlined:\r\n\r\nBeginning with nebulæ, we pass on to stars having banded or fluted\r\nspectra, indicating comparatively low temperatures and showing bands or\r\nlines of iron, manganese, calcium, and other metals. They are more or less\r\nred in colour, Antares in the Scorpion being one of the most brilliant red\r\nstars known. These stars are supposed to be in the process of aggregation,\r\nto be continually increasing in size and heat, and thus to be subject to\r\ngreat disturbances. Alpha Cygni has a similar spectrum but with more\r\nhydrogen, and is much hotter. The increase of heat goes on through Rigel\r\nand Beta Crucis, in which we find mainly hydrogen, helium, oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, and also carbon, but only faint traces of metals. Reaching the\r\nhottest of all--Epsilon Orionis and two stars in Argo--hydrogen is\r\npredominant, with traces of a few metals and carbon. The cooling series is\r\nindicated by thicker lines of hydrogen and thinner lines of the metallic\r\nelements, through Sirius, to Arcturus and our sun, thence to 19 Piscium,\r\nwhich shows chiefly flutings of carbon, with a few faint metallic lines.\r\nThe process of further cooling brings us to the dark stars.\r\n\r\nWe have here a complete scheme of evolution, carrying us from those\r\nill-defined but enormously diffused masses of gas and cosmic dust we know\r\nas nebulæ, through planetary nebulæ, nebulous stars, variable and\r\ndouble-stars, to red and white stars and on to those exhibiting the most\r\nintense blue-white lustre. We must remember, however, that the most\r\nbrilliant of these stars, showing a gaseous spectrum and forming the\r\nculminating point of the ascending series, are not necessarily hotter than,\r\nor even so hot as, some of those far down on the descending scale; since\r\nit is one of the apparent paradoxes of physics that a body may become\r\nhotter during the very process of contraction through loss of heat. The\r\nreason is that by cooling it contracts and thus becomes denser, that a\r\nportion of its mass falls towards its centre, and in doing so produces an\r\namount of heat which, though absolutely less than the heat lost in cooling,\r\nwill under certain conditions cause the reduced surface to become hotter.\r\nThe essential point is, that the body in question must be wholly gaseous,\r\nallowing of free circulation from surface to centre. The law, as given by\r\nProfessor S. Newcomb, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n'_When a spherical mass of incandescent gas contracts through the loss of\r\nits heat by radiation into space, its temperature continually becomes\r\nhigher as long as the gaseous condition is retained._'\r\n\r\nTo put it in another way: if the compression was caused by external force\r\nand no heat was lost, the globe would get hotter by a calculable amount for\r\neach unit of contraction. But the heat lost in causing a similar amount of\r\ncontraction is so little more than the increase of heat produced by\r\ncontraction, that the slightly diminished total heat in a smaller bulk\r\ncauses the temperature of the mass to increase.\r\n\r\nBut if, as there is reason to believe, the various types of stars differ\r\nalso in chemical constitution, some consisting mainly of the more permanent\r\ngases, while in others the various metallic and non-metallic elements are\r\npresent in very different proportions, there should really be a\r\nclassification by constitution as well as by temperature, and the course of\r\nevolution of the differently constituted groups may be to some extent\r\ndissimilar.\r\n\r\nWith this limitation the process of evolution and decay of sun through a\r\ncycle of increasing and decreasing temperature, as suggested by Sir Norman\r\nLockyer, is clear and suggestive. During the ascending series the star is\r\ngrowing both in mass and heat, by the continual accretion of meteoritic\r\nmatter either drawn to it by gravitation or falling towards it through the\r\nproper motions of independent masses. This goes on till all the matter for\r\nsome distance around the star has been utilised, and a maximum of size,\r\nheat, and brilliancy attained. Then the loss of heat by radiation is no\r\nlonger compensated by the influx of fresh matter, and a slow contraction\r\noccurs accompanied by a slightly increased temperature. But owing to the\r\nmore stable conditions continuous envelopes of metals in the gaseous state\r\nare formed, which check the loss of heat and reduce the brilliancy of\r\ncolour; whence it follows that bodies like our sun may be really hotter\r\nthan the most brilliant white stars, though not giving out quite so much\r\nheat. The loss of heat is therefore reduced; and this may serve to account\r\nfor the undoubted fact that during the enormous epochs of geological time\r\nthere has been very little diminution in the amount of heat we have\r\nreceived from the sun.\r\n\r\nOn the general question of the meteoritic hypothesis one of our first\r\nmathematicians, Professor George Darwin, has thus expressed his views: 'The\r\nconception of the growth of the planetary bodies by the aggregation of\r\nmeteorites is a good one, and perhaps seems more probable than the\r\nhypothesis that the whole solar system was gaseous.' I may add, that one of\r\nthe chief objections made to it, that meteorites are too complex to be\r\nsupposed to be the primitive matter out of which suns and worlds have been\r\nmade, does not seem to me valid. The primitive matter, whatever it was, may\r\nhave been used up again and again, and if collisions of large solid globes\r\never occur--and it is assumed by most astronomers that they must sometimes\r\noccur--then meteoric particles of all sizes would be produced which might\r\nexhibit any complexity of mineral constitution. The material universe has\r\nprobably been in existence long enough for all the primitive elements to\r\nhave been again and again combined into the minerals found upon the earth\r\nand many others. It cannot be too often repeated that no explanation--no\r\ntheory--can ever take us to the beginning of things, but only one or two\r\nsteps at a time into the dim past, which may enable us to comprehend,\r\nhowever imperfectly, the processes by which the world, or the universe, as\r\nit is, has been developed out of some earlier and simpler condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nARE THE STARS INFINITE IN NUMBER?\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the critics of my first short discussion of this subject laid great\r\nstress upon the impossibility of proving that the universe, a part of which\r\nwe see, is not infinite; and a well-known astronomer declared that unless\r\nit can be demonstrated that our universe is finite the entire argument\r\nfounded upon our position within it fall to the ground. I had laid myself\r\nopen to this objection by rather incautiously admitting that if the\r\npreponderance of evidence pointed in this direction any inquiry as to our\r\nplace in the universe would be useless, because as regards infinity there\r\ncan be no difference of position. But this statement is by no means exact,\r\nand even in an infinite universe of matter containing an infinite number of\r\nstars, such as those we see, there might well be such infinite diversities\r\nof distribution and arrangement as would give to certain positions all the\r\nadvantages which I submit we actually possess. Supposing, for example, that\r\nbeyond the vast ring of the Milky Way the stars rapidly decrease in number\r\nin all directions for a distance of a hundred or a thousand times the\r\ndiameter of that ring, and that then for an equal distance they slowly\r\nincrease again and become aggregated into systems or universes totally\r\ndistinct from ours in form and structure, and so remote that they can\r\ninfluence us in no way whatever. Then, I maintain, our position within our\r\nown stellar universe might have exactly the same importance, and be equally\r\nsuggestive, as if ours were the only material universe in existence--as if\r\nthe apparent diminution in the number of stars (which is an observed fact)\r\nindicated a continuous diminution, leading at some unknown distance to\r\nentire absence of luminous--that is, of active, energy-emitting\r\naggregations of matter.[1] As to whether there are such other material\r\nuniverses or not I offer no opinion, and have no belief one way or the\r\nother. I consider all speculations as to what may or may not exist in\r\ninfinite space to be utterly valueless. I have limited my inquiries\r\nstrictly to the evidence accumulated by modern astronomers, and to direct\r\ninferences and logical deductions from that evidence. Yet, to my great\r\nsurprise, my chief critic declares that 'Dr. Wallace's underlying error is,\r\nindeed, that he has reasoned from the area which we can embrace with our\r\nlimited perceptions to the infinite beyond our mental or intellectual\r\ngrasp.' I have distinctly _not_ done this, but many astronomers have done\r\nso. The late Richard Proctor not only continually discussed the question of\r\ninfinite matter as well as infinite space, but also argued, from the\r\nsupposed attributes of the Deity, for the necessity of holding this\r\nmaterial universe to be infinite, and the last chapter of his _Other Worlds\r\nthan Ours_ is mainly devoted to such speculations. In a later work, _Our\r\nPlace among Infinities_, he says that 'the teachings of science bring us\r\ninto the presence of the unquestionable infinities of time and of space,\r\nand the presumable infinities of matter and of operation--hence therefore\r\ninto the presence of infinity of energy. But science teaches us nothing\r\nabout these infinities as such. They remain none the less inconceivable,\r\nhowever clearly we may be taught to recognise their reality.' All this is\r\nvery reasonable, and the last sentence is particularly important.\r\nNevertheless, many writers allow their reasonings from facts to be\r\ninfluenced by these ideas of infinity. In Proctor's posthumous work, _Old\r\nand New Astronomy_, the late Mr. Ranyard, who edited it, writes: 'If we\r\nreject as abhorrent to our minds the supposition that the universe is not\r\ninfinite, we are thrown back on one of two alternatives--either the ether\r\nwhich transmits the light of the stars to us is not perfectly elastic, or a\r\nlarge proportion of the light of the stars is obliterated by dark bodies.'\r\nHere we have a well-informed astronomer allowing his abhorrence of the idea\r\nof a finite universe to affect his reasoning on the actual phenomena we can\r\nobserve--doing in fact exactly what my critic erroneously accuses me of\r\ndoing. But setting aside all ideas and prepossessions of the kind here\r\nindicated, let us see what are the actual facts revealed by the best\r\ninstruments of modern astronomy, and what are the natural and logical\r\ninferences from those facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THE STARS INFINITE IN NUMBER?\r\n\r\nThe views of those astronomers who have paid attention to this subject are,\r\non the whole, in favour of the view that the stellar universe is limited in\r\nextent and the stars therefore limited in number. A few quotations will\r\nbest exhibit their opinions on this question, with some of the facts and\r\nobservations on which they are founded.\r\n\r\nMiss A.M. Clerke, in her admirable volume, _The System of the Stars_, says:\r\n'The sidereal world presents us, to all appearance, with a finite\r\nsystem.... The probability amounts almost to certainty that star-strewn\r\nspace is of measurable dimensions. For from innumerable stars a limitless\r\nsum-total of radiations should be derived, by which darkness would be\r\nbanished from our skies; and the \"intense inane,\" glowing with the mingled\r\nbeams of suns individually indistinguishable, would bewilder our feeble\r\nsenses with its monotonous splendour.... Unless, that is to say, light\r\nsuffer some degree of enfeeblement in space.... But there is not a particle\r\nof evidence that any such toll is exacted; contrary indications are strong;\r\nand the assertion that its payment is inevitable depends upon analogies\r\nwhich may be wholly visionary. We are then, for the present, entitled to\r\ndisregard the problematical effect of a more than dubious cause.'\r\n\r\nProfessor Simon Newcomb, one of the first of American mathematicians and\r\nastronomers, arrives at a similar conclusion in his most recent volume,\r\n_The Stars_ (1902). He says, in his conclusions at the end of the work:\r\n'That collection of stars which we call the universe is limited in extent.\r\nThe smallest stars that we see with the most powerful telescopes are not,\r\nfor the most part, more distant than those a grade brighter, but are mostly\r\nstars of less luminosity situate in the same regions' (p. 319). And on page\r\n229 of the same work he gives reasons for this conclusion, as follows:\r\n'There is a law of optics which throws some light on the question. Suppose\r\nthe stars to be scattered through infinite space so that every great\r\nportion of space is, in the general average, equally rich in stars. Then at\r\nsome great distance we describe a sphere having its centre in our sun.\r\nOutside this sphere describe another one of a greater radius, and beyond\r\nthis other spheres at equal distances apart indefinitely. Thus we shall\r\nhave an endless succession of spherical shells, each of the same thickness.\r\nThe volume of each of these shells will be nearly proportional to the\r\nsquares of the diameters of the spheres which bound it. Hence each of the\r\nregions will contain a number of stars increasing as the square of the\r\nradius of the region. Since the amount of light we receive from each star\r\nis as the inverse square of its distance, it follows that the sum total of\r\nthe light received from each of these spherical shells will be equal. Thus\r\nas we add sphere after sphere we add equal amounts of light without limit.\r\nThe result would be that if the system of stars extended out indefinitely\r\nthe whole heavens would be filled with a blaze of light as bright as the\r\nsun.'\r\n\r\nBut the whole light given us by the stars is variously estimated at from\r\none-fortieth to one-twentieth or, as an extreme limit, to one-tenth of\r\nmoonlight, while the sun gives as much light as 300,000 full moons, so\r\nthat starlight is only equivalent at a fair estimate to the six-millionth\r\npart of sunlight. Keeping this in mind, the possible causes of the\r\nextinction of almost the whole of the light of the stars (if they are\r\ninfinite in number and distributed, on the average, as thickly beyond the\r\nMilky Way as they are up to its outer boundary) are absurdly inadequate.\r\nThese causes are (1) the loss of light in passing through the ether, and\r\n(2) the stoppage of light by dark stars or diffused meteoritic dust. As to\r\nthe first, it is generally admitted that there is not a particle of\r\nevidence of its existence. There is, however, some distinct evidence that,\r\nif it exists, it is so very small in amount that it would not produce a\r\nperceptible effect for any distances less remote than hundreds or perhaps\r\nthousands of times as far as the farthest limits of the Milky Way are from\r\nus. This is indicated by the fact that the brightest stars are _not_\r\nalways, or even generally, the nearest to us, as is shown both by their\r\nsmall proper motions and the absence of measurable parallax. Mr. Gore\r\nstates that out of twenty-five stars, with proper motions of more than two\r\nseconds annually, only two are above the third magnitude. Many first\r\nmagnitude stars, including Canopus, the second brightest star in the\r\nheavens, are so remote that no parallax can be found, notwithstanding\r\nrepeated efforts. They must therefore be much farther off than many small\r\nand telescopic stars, and perhaps as far as the Milky Way, in which so many\r\nbrilliant stars are found; whereas if any considerable amount of light were\r\nlost in passing that distance we should find but few stars of the first\r\ntwo or three magnitudes that were very remote from us. Of the twenty-three\r\nstars of the first magnitude, only ten have been found to have parallaxes\r\nof more than one-twentieth of a second, while five range from that small\r\namount down to one or two hundredths of a second, and there are two with no\r\nascertainable parallax. Again, there are 309 stars brighter than magnitude\r\n3.5, yet only thirty-one of these have proper motions of more than 100\" a\r\ncentury, and of these only eighteen have parallaxes of more than\r\none-twentieth of a second. These figures are from tables given in Professor\r\nNewcomb's book, and they have very great significance, since they indicate\r\nthat the brightest stars are _not_ the nearest to us. More than this, they\r\nshow that out of the seventy-two stars whose distance has been measured\r\nwith some approach to certainty, only twenty-three (having a parallax of\r\nmore than one-fiftieth of a second) are of greater magnitudes than 3.5,\r\nwhile no less than forty-nine are smaller stars down to the eighth or ninth\r\nmagnitude, and these are on the average much nearer to us than the brighter\r\nstars!\r\n\r\nTaking the whole of the stars whose parallaxes are given by Professor\r\nNewcomb, we find that the average parallax of the thirty-one bright stars\r\n(from 3.5 magnitude up to Sirius) is 0.11 seconds; while that of the\r\nforty-one stars below 3.5 magnitude down to about 9.5, is 0.21 seconds,\r\nshowing that they are, on the average, only half as far from us as the\r\nbrighter stars. The same conclusion was reached by Mr. Thomas Lewis of the\r\nGreenwich Observatory in 1895, namely, that the stars from 2.70 magnitude\r\ndown to about 8.40 magnitude have, on the average, double the parallaxes\r\nof the brighter stars. This very curious and unexpected fact, however it\r\nmay be accounted for, is directly opposed to the idea of there being any\r\nloss of light by the more distant as compared with the nearer stars; for if\r\nthere should be such a loss it would render the above phenomenon still more\r\ndifficult of explanation, because it would tend to exaggerate it. The\r\nbright stars being on the whole farther away from us than the less bright\r\ndown to the eighth and ninth magnitudes, it follows, if there is any loss\r\nof light, that the bright stars are really brighter than they appear to us,\r\nbecause, owing to their enormous distance some of their light has been lost\r\nbefore it reached us. Of course it may be said that this does not\r\n_demonstrate_ that no light is lost in passing through space; but, on the\r\nother hand, it is exactly the opposite of what we should expect if the more\r\ndistant stars were perceptibly dimmed by this cause, and it may be\r\nconsidered to prove that if there is any loss it is exceedingly small, and\r\nwill not affect the question of the limits of our stellar system, which is\r\nall that we are dealing with.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable fact of the enormous remoteness of the majority of the\r\nbrighter stars is equally effective as an argument against the loss of\r\nlight by dark stars or cosmic dust, because, if the light is not\r\nappreciably diminished for stars which have less than the fiftieth of a\r\nsecond of parallax, it cannot greatly interfere with our estimates of the\r\nlimits of our universe.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. E.W. Maunder of the Greenwich Observatory and Professor W.W.\r\nTurner of Oxford lay great stress on these dark bodies, and the former\r\nquotes Sir Robert Ball as saying, 'the dark stars are incomparably more\r\nnumerous than those that we can see ... and to attempt to number the stars\r\nof our universe by those whose transitory brightness we can perceive would\r\nbe like estimating the number of horseshoes in England by those which are\r\nred-hot.' But the proportion of dark stars (or nebulæ) to bright ones\r\ncannot be determined _a priori_, since it must depend upon the causes that\r\nheat the stars, and how frequently those causes come into action as\r\ncompared with the life of a bright star. We do know, both from the\r\nstability of the light of the stars during the historic period and much\r\nmore precisely by the enormous epochs during which our sun has supported\r\nlife upon this earth--yet which must have been 'incomparably' less than its\r\nwhole existence as a light-giver--that the life of most stars must be\r\ncounted by hundreds or perhaps by thousands of millions of years. But we\r\nhave no knowledge whatever of the rate at which true stars are born. The\r\nso-called 'new stars' which occasionally appear evidently belong to a\r\ndifferent category. They blaze out suddenly and almost as suddenly fade\r\naway into obscurity or total invisibility. But the true stars probably go\r\nthrough their stages of origin, growth, maturity, and decay, with extreme\r\nslowness, so that it is not as yet possible for us to determine by\r\nobservation when they are born or when they die. In this respect they\r\ncorrespond to species in the organic world. They would probably first be\r\nknown to us as stars or minute nebulæ: at the extreme limit of telescopic\r\nvision or of photographic sensitiveness, and the growth of their\r\nluminosity might be so gradual as to require hundreds, perhaps thousands of\r\nyears to be distinctly recognisable. Hence the argument derived from the\r\nfact that we have never witnessed the birth of a true permanent star, and\r\nthat, therefore, such occurrences are very rare, is valueless. New stars\r\nmay arise every year or every day without our recognising them; and if this\r\nis the case, the reservoir of dark bodies, whether in the form of large\r\nmasses or of clouds of cosmic dust, so far from being incomparably greater\r\nthan the whole of the visible stars and nebulæ, may quite possibly be only\r\nequal to it, or at most a few times greater; and in that case, considering\r\nthe enormous distances that separate the stars (or star-systems) from each\r\nother, they would have no appreciable effect in shutting out from our view\r\nany considerable proportion of the luminous bodies constituting our stellar\r\nuniverse. It follows, that Professor Newcomb's argument as to the very\r\nsmall total light given by the stars has not been even weakened by any of\r\nthe facts or arguments adduced against it.\r\n\r\nMr. W.H.S. Monck, in a letter to _Knowledge_ (May 1903), puts the case\r\nvery strongly so as to support my view. He says:--'The highest estimate\r\nthat I have seen of the total light of the full moon is 1/300000 of that of\r\nthe sun. Suppose that the dark bodies were a hundred and fifty thousand\r\ntimes as numerous as the bright ones. Then the whole sky ought to be as\r\nbright as the illuminated portion of the moon. Every one knows that this is\r\nnot so. But it is said that the stars, though infinite, may only extend to\r\ninfinity in particular directions, _e.g._ in that of the Galaxy. Be it so.\r\nWhere, in the very brightest portion of the Galaxy, will we find a part\r\nequal in angular magnitude to the moon which affords us the same quantity\r\nof light? In the very brightest spot, the light probably does not amount to\r\none hundredth part that of the full moon.' It follows that, even if dark\r\nstars were fifteen million times as numerous as the bright ones, Professor\r\nNewcomb's argument would still apply against an infinite universe of stars\r\nof the same average density as the portion we see.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELESCOPIC EVIDENCE AS TO THE LIMITS OF THE STAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThroughout the earlier portion of the nineteenth century every increase of\r\npower and of light-giving qualities of telescopes added so greatly to the\r\nnumber of the stars which became visible, that it was generally assumed\r\nthat this increase would go on indefinitely, and that the stars were really\r\ninfinite in number and could not be exhausted. But of late years it has\r\nbeen found that the increase in the number of stars visible in the larger\r\ntelescopes was not so great as might be expected, while in many parts of\r\nthe heavens a longer exposure of the photographic plate adds comparatively\r\nlittle to the number of stars obtained by a shorter exposure with the same\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nMr. J.E. Gore's testimony on this point is very clear. He says:--'Those who\r\ndo not give the subject sufficient consideration, seem to think that the\r\nnumber of the stars is practically infinite, or at least, that the number\r\nis so great that it cannot be estimated. But this idea is totally\r\nincorrect, and due to complete ignorance of telescopic revelations. It is\r\ncertainly true that, to a certain extent, the larger the telescope used in\r\nthe examination of the heavens, the more the number of the stars seems to\r\nincrease; but we now know that there is a limit to this increase of\r\ntelescopic vision. And the evidence clearly shows that we are rapidly\r\napproaching this limit. Although the number of stars visible in the\r\nPleiades rapidly increases at first with increase in the size of the\r\ntelescope used, and although photography has still further increased the\r\nnumber of stars in this remarkable cluster, it has recently been found that\r\nan increased length of exposure--beyond three hours--adds very few stars to\r\nthe number visible on the photograph taken at the Paris Observatory in\r\n1885, on which over two thousand stars can be counted. Even with this great\r\nnumber on so small an area of the heavens, comparatively large vacant\r\nplaces are visible between the stars, and a glance at the original\r\nphotograph is sufficient to show that there would be ample room for many\r\ntimes the number actually visible. I find that if the whole heavens were as\r\nrich in stars as the Pleiades, there would be only thirty-three millions in\r\nboth hemispheres.'\r\n\r\nAgain, referring to the fact that Celoria, with a telescope showing stars\r\ndown to the eleventh magnitude, could see almost exactly the same number of\r\nstars near the north pole of the Galaxy as Sir William Herschel found with\r\nhis much larger and more powerful telescope, he remarks: 'Their absence,\r\ntherefore, seems certain proof that very faint stars do _not_ exist in that\r\ndirection, and that here, at least, the sidereal universe is limited in\r\nextent.'\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel notes the same phenomena, stating that even in the Milky\r\nWay there are found 'spaces absolutely dark _and completely void of any\r\nstar_, even of the smallest telescopic magnitude'; while in other parts\r\n'extremely minute stars, though never altogether wanting, occur in numbers\r\nso moderate as to lead us irresistibly to the conclusion that in these\r\nregions we see _fairly through_ the starry stratum, since it is impossible\r\notherwise (supposing their light not intercepted) that the numbers of the\r\nsmaller magnitudes should not go on continually increasing ad infinitum. In\r\nsuch cases, moreover, the ground of the heavens, as seen between the stars,\r\nis for the most part perfectly dark, which again would not be the case if\r\ninnumerable multitudes of stars, too minute to be individually discernible,\r\nexisted beyond.' And again he sums up as follows:--'Throughout by far the\r\nlarger portion of the extent of the Milky Way in both hemispheres, the\r\ngeneral blackness of the ground of the heavens on which its stars are\r\nprojected, and the absence of that innumerable multitude and excessive\r\ncrowding of the smallest visible magnitudes, and of glare produced by the\r\naggregate light of multitudes too small to affect the eye singly, which the\r\ncontrary supposition would appear to necessitate, must, we think, be\r\nconsidered unequivocal indications that its dimensions _in directions where\r\nthese conditions obtain_, are not only not infinite, but that the\r\nspace-penetrating power of our telescopes suffices fairly to pierce\r\nthrough and beyond it.'[2]\r\n\r\nThis expression of opinion by the astronomer who, probably beyond any now\r\nliving, was the most competent authority on this question, to which he\r\ndevoted a long life of observation and study extending over the whole\r\nheavens, cannot be lightly set aside by the opinions or conjectures of\r\nthose who seem to assume that we must believe in an infinity of stars if\r\nthe contrary cannot be absolutely proved. But as not a particle of evidence\r\ncan be adduced to prove infinity, and as all the facts and indications\r\npoint, as here shown, in a directly opposite direction, we must, if we are\r\nto trust to evidence at all in this matter, arrive at the conclusion that\r\nthe universe of stars is limited in extent.\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Roberts gives similar evidence as regards the use of\r\nphotographic plates. He writes:--'Eleven years ago photographs of the\r\nGreat Nebula in _Andromeda_ were taken with the 20-inch reflector, and\r\nexposures of the plates during intervals up to four hours; and upon some\r\nof them were depicted stars to the faintness of 17th to 18th magnitude,\r\nand nebulosity to an equal degree of faintness. The films of the plates\r\nobtainable in those days were less sensitive than those which have been\r\navailable during the past five years, and during this period photographs\r\nof the nebula with exposures up to four hours have been taken with the\r\n20-inch reflector. No extensions of the nebulosity, however, nor\r\nincrease in the number of the stars can be seen on the later rapid\r\nplates than were depicted upon the earlier slower ones, though the\r\nstar-images and the nebulosity have greater density on the later\r\nplates.'\r\n\r\nExactly similar facts are recorded in the cases of the Great Nebula in\r\n_Orion_, and the group of the Pleiades. In the case of the Milky Way in\r\n_Cygnus_ photographs have been taken with the same instrument, but with\r\nexposures varying from one hour to two hours and a half, but no fainter\r\nstars could be found on one than on the other; and this fact has been\r\nconfirmed by similar photographs of other areas in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF DIMINISHING NUMBERS OF STARS\r\n\r\nWe will now consider another kind of evidence equally weighty with the two\r\nalready adduced. This is what may be termed the law of diminishing numbers\r\nbeyond a certain magnitude, as observed by larger and larger telescopes.\r\n\r\nFor some years past star-magnitudes have been determined very accurately by\r\nmeans of careful photometric comparisons. Down to the sixth magnitude stars\r\nare visible to the naked eye, and are hence termed lucid stars. All fainter\r\nstars are telescopic, and continuing the magnitudes in a series in which\r\nthe difference in luminosity between each successive magnitude is equal,\r\nthe seventeenth magnitude is reached and indicates the range of visibility\r\nin the largest telescopes now in existence. By the scale now used a star of\r\nany magnitude gives nearly two and a half times as much light as one of the\r\nnext lower magnitude, and for accurate comparison the apparent brightness\r\nof each star is given to the tenth of a magnitude which can easily be\r\nobserved. Of course, owing to differences in the colour of stars, these\r\ndeterminations cannot be made with perfect accuracy, but no important error\r\nis due to this cause. According to this scale a sixth magnitude star gives\r\nabout one-hundredth part of the light of an average first magnitude star.\r\nSirius is so exceptionally bright that it gives nine times as much light as\r\na standard or average first magnitude star.\r\n\r\nNow it is found that from the first to the sixth magnitude the stars\r\nincrease in number at the rate of about three and a half times those of the\r\npreceding magnitudes. The total number of stars down to the sixth magnitude\r\nis given by Professor Newcomb as 7647. For higher magnitudes the numbers\r\nare so great that precision and uniformity are more difficult of\r\nattainment; yet there is a wonderful continuance of the same law of\r\nincrease down to the tenth magnitude, which is estimated to include\r\n2,311,000 stars, thus conforming very nearly with the ratio of 3.5 as\r\ndetermined by the lucid stars.\r\n\r\nBut when we pass beyond the tenth magnitude to those vast numbers of faint\r\nstars only to be seen in the best or the largest telescopes, there appears\r\nto be a sudden change in the ratio of increased numbers per magnitude. The\r\nnumbers of these stars are so great that it is impossible to count the\r\nwhole as with the higher magnitude stars, but numerous counts have been\r\nmade by many astronomers in small measured areas in different parts of the\r\nheavens, so that a fair average has been obtained, and it is possible to\r\nmake a near approximation to the total number visible down to the\r\nseventeenth magnitude. The estimate of these by astronomers who have made a\r\nspecial study of this subject is, that the total number of visible stars\r\ndoes not exceed one hundred millions.[3]\r\n\r\nBut if we take the number of stars down to the ninth magnitude, which are\r\nknown with considerable accuracy, and find the numbers in each succeeding\r\nmagnitude down to the seventeenth, according to the same ratio of increase\r\nwhich has been found to correspond very nearly in the case of the higher\r\nmagnitudes, Mr. J.E. Gore finds that the total number should be about 1400\r\nmillions. Of course neither of these estimates makes any pretence to exact\r\naccuracy, but they are founded on all the facts at present available, and\r\nare generally accepted by astronomers as being the nearest approach that\r\ncan be made to the true numbers. The discrepancy is, however, so enormous\r\nthat probably no careful observer of the heavens with very large telescopes\r\ndoubts that there is a very real and very rapid diminution in the numbers\r\nof the fainter as compared with the brighter stars.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, yet one more indication of the decreasing numbers of the\r\nfaint telescopic stars, which is almost conclusive on this question, and,\r\nso far as I am aware, has not yet been used in this relation. I will\r\ntherefore briefly state it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT RATIO AS INDICATING THE NUMBER OF FAINT STARS\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb points out a remarkable result depending on the fact\r\nthat, while the average light of successively lower magnitudes diminishes\r\nin a ratio of 2.5, their numbers increase at nearly a ratio of 3.5. From\r\nthis it follows that, so long as this law of increase continues, the total\r\nof starlight goes on increasing by about forty per cent. for each\r\nsuccessive magnitude, and he gives the following table to illustrate it:--\r\n\r\n    Mag. 1    Total Light  =  1\r\n     \"   2         \"       =  1.4\r\n     \"   3         \"       =  2.0\r\n     \"   4         \"       =  2.8\r\n     \"   5         \"       =  4.0\r\n     \"   6         \"       =  5.7\r\n     \"   7         \"       =  8.0\r\n     \"   8         \"       = 11.3\r\n     \"   9         \"       = 16.0\r\n     \"  10         \"       = 22.6\r\n                         --------\r\n    Total light to Mag. 10 = 74.8\r\n                         --------\r\n\r\nThus the total amount of the light given by all stars down to the tenth\r\nmagnitude is seventy-four times as great as that from the few first\r\nmagnitude stars. We also see that the light given by the stars of any\r\nmagnitude is twice as much as that of the stars two magnitudes higher in\r\nthe scale, so that we can easily calculate what additional light we ought\r\nto receive from each additional magnitude if they continue to increase in\r\nnumbers below the tenth as they do above that magnitude. Now it has been\r\ncalculated as the result of careful observations, that the total light\r\ngiven by stars down to nine and a half magnitude is one-eightieth of full\r\nmoonlight, though some make it much more. But if we continue the table of\r\nlight-ratios from this low starting-point down to magnitude seventeen and a\r\nhalf, we shall find, if the numbers of the stars go on increasing at the\r\nsame rate as before, that the light of all combined should be at least\r\nseven times as great as moonlight; whereas the photometric measurements\r\nmake it actually about one-twentieth. And as the calculation from\r\nlight-ratios only includes stars just visible in the largest telescopes,\r\nand does not include all those proved to exist by photography, we have in\r\nthis case a demonstration that the numbers of the stars below the tenth and\r\ndown to the seventeenth magnitude diminish rapidly.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the minuter telescopic stars preponderate enormously\r\nin and near the Milky Way. At a distance from it they diminish rapidly,\r\ntill near its poles they are almost entirely absent. This is shown by the\r\nfact (already referred to at p. 146) that Professor Celoria of Milan, with\r\na telescope of less than three inches aperture, counted almost as many\r\nstars in that region as did Herschel with his eighteen-inch reflector. But\r\nif the stellar universe extends without limit we can hardly suppose it to\r\ndo so in one plane only; hence the absence of the minuter stars and of\r\ndiffused milky light over the larger part of the heavens is now held to\r\nprove that the myriads of very minute stars in the Milky Way really belong\r\nto it, and not to the depths of space far beyond.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that here we have a fairly direct proof that the stars of\r\nour universe are really limited in number.\r\n\r\nThere are thus four distinct lines of argument all pointing with more or\r\nless force to the conclusion that the stellar universe we see around us, so\r\nfar from being infinite, is strictly limited in extent and of a definite\r\nform and constitution. They may be briefly summarised as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Professor Newcomb shows that, if the stars were infinite in number, and\r\nif those we see were approximately a fair sample of the whole, and further,\r\nif there were not sufficient dark bodies to shut out almost the whole of\r\ntheir light, then we should receive from them an amount of light\r\ntheoretically greater than that of sunlight. I have shown, at some length,\r\nthat neither of these causes of loss of light will account for the enormous\r\ndisproportion between the theoretical and the actual light received from\r\nthe stars; and therefore Professor Newcomb's argument must be held to be a\r\nvalid one against the infinite extent of our universe. Of course, this does\r\nnot imply that there may not be any number of other universes in space, but\r\nas we know absolutely nothing of them--even whether they are material or\r\nnon-material--all speculation as to their existence is worse than useless.\r\n\r\n(2) The next argument depends on the fact that all over the heavens, even\r\nin the Milky Way itself, there are areas of considerable extent, besides\r\nrifts, lanes, and circular patches, where stars are either quite absent or\r\nvery faint and few in number. In many of these areas the largest telescopes\r\nshow no more stars than those of moderate size, while the few stars seen\r\nare projected on an intensely dark background. Sir William Herschel,\r\nHumboldt, Sir John Herschel, R.A. Proctor, and many living astronomers hold\r\nthat, in these dark areas, rifts, and patches, we see completely through\r\nour stellar universe into the starless depths of space beyond.\r\n\r\n(3) Then we have the remarkable fact that the steady increase in the number\r\nof stars, down to the ninth or tenth magnitudes, following one constant\r\nratio either gradually or suddenly changes, so that the total number from\r\nthe tenth down to the seventeenth magnitudes is only about one-tenth of\r\nwhat it would have been had the same ratio of increase continued. The\r\nconclusion to be drawn from this fact clearly is, that these faint stars\r\nare becoming more and more thinly scattered in space, while the dark\r\nbackground on which they are usually seen shows that, except in the region\r\nof the Milky Way, there are _not_ multitudes of still smaller invisible\r\nstars beyond them.\r\n\r\n(4) The last indication of a limited stellar universe--the estimate of\r\nnumbers by the light-ratio of each successive magnitude--powerfully\r\nsupports the three preceding arguments.\r\n\r\nThe four distinct classes of evidence now adduced must be held to\r\nconstitute, as nearly as the circumstances permit, a satisfactory proof\r\nthat the stellar universe, of which our solar system forms a part, has\r\ndefinite limits; and that a full knowledge of its form, structure, and\r\nextent, is not beyond the possibility of attainment by the astronomers of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In a letter to _Knowledge_, June 1903, Mr. W.H.T.

Sir John Herschel termed it 'the ground-plane of the\r\nsidereal system'; and the more it is studied the more we become convinced\r\nthat the whole of the stellar universe--stars, clusters of stars, and\r\nnebulæ--are in some way connected with it, and are probably dependent on it\r\nor controlled by it. Not only does it contain a greater number of stars of\r\nthe higher magnitudes than any other part of the heavens of equal extent,\r\nbut it also comprises a great preponderance of star-clusters, and a great\r\nextent of diffused nebulous matter, besides the innumerable myriads of\r\nminute stars which produce its characteristic cloud-like appearance. It is\r\nalso the region of those strange outbursts forming new stars; while gaseous\r\nstars of enormous bulk--some probably a thousand or even ten thousand\r\ntimes that of our sun, and of intense heat and brilliancy--are more\r\nabundant there than in any other part of the heavens. It is now almost\r\ncertain that these enormous stars and the myriads of minute stars just\r\nvisible with the largest telescopes, are actually intermingled, and\r\ntogether constitute its essential features; in which case the fainter stars\r\nare really small and cannot be far apart, forming, as it were, the first\r\naggregations of the nebulous substratum, and perhaps supplying the fuel\r\nwhich keeps up the intense brilliancy of the giant suns. If this is so,\r\nthen the Galaxy must be the theatre of operation of vast forces, and of\r\ncontinuous combinations of matter, which escape our notice owing to its\r\nenormous distance from us. Among its millions of minute telescopic stars,\r\nhundreds or thousands may appear or disappear yearly without being\r\nperceived by us, till the photographic charts are completed and can be\r\nminutely scrutinised at short intervals. As undoubted changes have occurred\r\nin many of the larger nebulæ during the last fifty years, we may anticipate\r\nthat analogous changes will soon be noted in the stars and the nebulous\r\nmasses of the Milky Way. Dr. Isaac Roberts has even observed changes in\r\nnebulæ after such a short interval as eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY A GREAT CIRCLE\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all its irregularities, its divisions, and its diverging\r\nbranches, astronomers are generally agreed that the Milky Way forms a great\r\ncircle in the heavens. Sir John Herschel, whose knowledge of it was\r\nunrivalled, stated that its course 'conforms, as nearly as the\r\nindefiniteness of its boundary will allow it to be fixed, to that of a\r\ngreat circle'; and he gives the Right Ascension and Declination of the\r\npoints where it crosses the equinoctial, in figures which define those\r\npoints as being exactly opposite each other. He also defines its northern\r\nand southern poles by other figures, so as to show that they are the poles\r\nof a great circle. And after referring to Struve's view that it was _not_ a\r\ngreat circle, he says, 'I retain my own opinion.' Professor Newcomb says\r\nthat its position 'is nearly always near a great circle of the sphere'; and\r\nagain he says: 'that we are in the galactic plane itself seems to be shown\r\nin two ways: (1) the equality in the counts of stars on the two sides of\r\nthis plane all the way to its poles; and (2) the fact that the central line\r\nof the Galaxy is a great circle, which it would not be if we viewed it from\r\none side of its central plane' (_The Stars_, p. 317). Miss Clerke, in her\r\n_History of Astronomy_, speaks of 'our situation _in_ the galactic plane'\r\nas one of the undisputed facts of astronomy; while Sir Norman Lockyer, in a\r\nlecture delivered in 1899, said, 'the middle line of the Milky Way is\r\nreally not distinguishable from a great circle,' and again in the same\r\nlecture--'but the recent work, chiefly of Gould in Argentina, has shown\r\nthat it practically is a great circle.'[4]\r\n\r\nAbout this fact, then, there can be no dispute. A great circle is a circle\r\ndividing the celestial sphere into two equal portions, as seen from the\r\nearth, and therefore the plane of this circle must pass through the earth.\r\nOf course the whole thing is on such a vast scale, the Milky Way varying\r\nfrom ten to thirty degrees wide, that the plane of its circular course\r\ncannot be determined with minute accuracy. But this is of little\r\nimportance. When carefully laid down on a chart, as in that of Mr. Sidney\r\nWaters (see end of volume), we can see that its central line does follow a\r\nvery even circular course, conforming 'as nearly as may be' to a great\r\ncircle. We are therefore certainly well within the space that would be\r\nenclosed if its northern and southern margins were connected together\r\nacross the vast intervening abyss, and in all probability not far from the\r\ncentral plane of that enclosed space.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORM OF THE MILKY WAY AND OUR POSITION ON ITS PLANE\r\n\r\nAlthough the Galaxy forms a great circle in the heavens from our point of\r\nview, it by no means follows that it is circular in plan. Being unequal in\r\nwidth and irregular in outline, it might be elliptic or even angular in\r\nshape without being at all obviously so to us. If we were standing in an\r\nopen plain or field two or three miles in diameter, and bounded in every\r\ndirection by woods of very irregular height and density and great diversity\r\nof tint, we should find it difficult to judge of the shape of the field,\r\nwhich might be either a true circle, an oval, a hexagon, or quite irregular\r\nin outline, without our being able to detect the exact shape unless some\r\nparts were very much nearer to us than others. Again, just as the woods\r\nbounding the field might be either a narrow belt of nearly uniform width,\r\nor might in some places be only a few yards wide and in others stretch out\r\nfor miles, so there have been many opinions as to the width of the Milky\r\nWay in the direction of its plane, that is, in the direction in which we\r\nlook towards it. Lately, however, as the result of long-continued\r\nobservation and study, astronomers are fairly well agreed as to its general\r\nform and extent, as will be seen by the following statements of fact and\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nMiss Clerke, after giving the various views of many astronomers--and as the\r\nhistorian of modern astronomy her opinion has much weight--considers that\r\nthe most probable view of it is, that it is really very much what it seems\r\nto us--an immense ring with streaming appendages extending from the main\r\nbody in all directions, producing the very complex effect we see. The\r\nbelief seems to be now spreading that the whole universe of stars is\r\nspherical or spheroidal, the Milky Way being its equator, and therefore in\r\nall probability circular or nearly so in plan; and it is also held that it\r\nmust be rotating--perhaps very slowly--as nothing else can be supposed to\r\nhave led to the formation of such a vast ring, or can preserve it when\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb considers, from the numbers of the stars in all\r\ndirections towards the Milky Way being approximately equal, that there\r\ncannot be much difference in our distance from it in various directions. It\r\nwould follow that its plan is approximately circular or broadly elliptic.\r\nThe existence of ring-nebulæ may be held to render such a form probable.\r\n\r\nSir Norman Lockyer gives facts which tend in the same direction. In an\r\narticle in _Nature_ of November 8th, 1900, he says: 'We find that the\r\ngaseous stars are not only confined to the Milky Way, but they are the most\r\nremote in every direction, in every galactic longitude; all of them have\r\nthe smallest proper motion.' And again, referring to the hottest stars\r\nbeing equally remote on all sides of us, he says: 'It is because we are in\r\nthe centre, because the solar system is in the centre, that the observed\r\neffect arises.' He also considers that the ring-nebula in Lyra nearly\r\nrepresents the form of our whole system; and he adds: 'We practically know\r\nthat in our system the centre is the region of least disturbance, and\r\ntherefore cooler conditions.'\r\n\r\nThese various facts and conclusions of some of the most eminent astronomers\r\nall point to one definite inference, that our position, or that of the\r\nsolar system, is not very far from the centre of the vast ring of stars\r\nconstituting the Milky Way, while the same facts imply a nearly circular\r\nform to this ring. Here, more than as regards our position in the plane of\r\nthe Galaxy, there is no possibility of precise determination; but it is\r\nquite certain that if we were situated very far away from the centre, say,\r\nfor instance, one-fourth of its diameter from one side of it and\r\nthree-fourths from the other, the appearances would not be what they are,\r\nand we should easily detect the excentricity of our position. Even if we\r\nwere one-third the diameter from one side and two-thirds from the other, it\r\nwill, I think, be admitted that this also would have been ascertained by\r\nthe various methods of research now available. We must, therefore, be\r\nsomewhere between the actual centre and a circle whose radius is one-third\r\nof the distance to the Milky Way. But if we are about midway between these\r\ntwo positions, we shall only be one-sixth of the radius or one-twelfth of\r\nthe diameter of the Milky Way from its exact centre; and if we form part of\r\na cluster or group of stars slowly revolving around that centre, we should\r\nprobably obtain all the advantages, if any, that may arise from a nearly\r\ncentral position in the entire star-system.\r\n\r\nThis question of our situation within the great circle of the Milky Way is\r\nof considerable importance from the point of view I am here suggesting, so\r\nthat every fact bearing upon it should be noted; and there is one which has\r\nnot, I think, been given the full weight due to it. It is generally\r\nadmitted that the greater brilliancy of some parts of the Milky Way is no\r\nindication of nearness, because surfaces possess equal brilliancy from\r\nwhatever distance they are seen. Thus each planet has its special\r\nbrilliancy or reflective power, technically termed its 'albedo,' and this\r\nremains the same at all distances if the other conditions are similar. But\r\nnotwithstanding this well-known fact, Sir John Herschel's remark that the\r\ngreater brightness of the southern Milky Way 'conveys strongly the\r\nimpression of greater proximity,' and therefore, that we are excentrically\r\nplaced in its plane, has been adopted by many writers as if it were the\r\nstatement of a fact, or at least a clearly expressed opinion, instead of\r\nbeing a mere 'impression,' and really a misleading one. I therefore wish to\r\nadduce a phenomenon which has a real bearing on the question. It is evident\r\nthat, if the Milky Way were actually of uniform width throughout, then\r\ndifferences of apparent width would indicate differences of distance. In\r\nthe parts nearer to us it would appear wider, where more remote, narrower;\r\nbut in these opposite directions there would not necessarily be any\r\ndifferences in brightness. We should, however, expect that in the parts\r\nnearer to us the lucid stars, as well as those within any definite limits\r\nof magnitude, would be either more numerous or more wide apart on the\r\naverage. No such difference as this, however, has been recorded; but there\r\n_is_ a peculiar correspondence in the opposite portions of the Galaxy which\r\nis very suggestive. In the beautiful charts of the Nebulæ and Star Clusters\r\nby the late Mr. Sidney Waters, published by the Royal Astronomical Society\r\nand here reproduced by their permission (see end of volume), the Milky Way\r\nis delineated in its whole extent with great detail and from the best\r\nauthorities. These charts show us that, in both hemispheres, it reaches its\r\nmaximum extension on the right and left margins of the charts, where it is\r\nalmost equal in extent; while in the centre of each chart, that is at its\r\nnearest points to the north and south poles respectively, it is at its\r\nnarrowest portion; and, although this part in the southern hemisphere is\r\nbrightest and most strongly defined, yet the actual extent, including the\r\nfainter portions, is, again, not very unequal in the opposite segments.\r\nHere we have a remarkable and significant symmetry in the proportions of\r\nthe Milky Way, which, taken in connection with the nearly symmetrical\r\nscattering of the stars in all parts of the vast ring, is strongly\r\nsuggestive of a nearly circular form and of our nearly central position\r\nwithin its plane. There is one other feature in this delineation of the\r\nMilky Way which is worthy of notice. It has been the universal practice to\r\nspeak of it as being double through a considerable portion of its extent,\r\nand all the usual star-maps show the division greatly exaggerated,\r\nespecially in the northern hemisphere; and this division was considered so\r\nimportant as to lead to the cloven-disc theory of its form, or that it\r\nconsisted of two separate irregular rings, the nearer one partly hiding the\r\nmore distant; while various spiral combinations were held by others to be\r\nthe best way of explaining its complex appearance. But this newer map,\r\nreduced from a large one by Lord Rosse's astronomer, Dr. Boeddicker, who\r\ndevoted five years to its delineation, shows us that there is no actual\r\ndivision in any portion of it in the northern hemisphere, but that\r\neverywhere, throughout its whole width, it consists of numerous\r\nintermingled streams and branches, varying greatly in luminosity, and with\r\nmany faint or barely distinguishable extensions along its margins, yet\r\nforming one unmistakable nebulous belt; and the same general character\r\napplies to it in the southern hemisphere as delineated by Dr. Gould.\r\n\r\nAnother feature, which is well shown to the eye by these more accurate\r\nmaps, is the regular curvature of the central line of the Milky Way. We can\r\njudge of this almost sufficiently by the eye; but if, with a pair of\r\ncompasses, we find the proper radius and centre of curvature, we shall see\r\nthat the true circular curve is always in the very centre of the nebulous\r\nmass, and the same radius applied in the same manner to the opposite\r\nhemisphere gives a similar result. It will be noted that as the Milky Way\r\nis obliquely situated on these charts, the centre of the curve will be\r\nabout in R.A. 0h. 40m. in the map of the southern hemisphere, and in R.A.\r\n12h. 40m. in that of the northern hemisphere; while the radius of curvature\r\nwill be about the length of the chord of eight hours of R.A. as measured on\r\nthe margin of the maps. This great regularity of curve of the central line\r\nof the Galaxy strongly suggests rotation as the only means by which it\r\ncould have originated and be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR CLUSTER\r\n\r\nAstronomers are now generally agreed that there is a cluster of stars of\r\nwhich our sun forms a part, though its exact dimensions, form, and limits\r\nare still under discussion. Sir William Herschel long ago arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the Milky Way 'consists of stars very differently scattered\r\nfrom those immediately around us.' Dr. Gould believed that there were about\r\nfive hundred bright stars much nearer to us than the Milky Way, which he\r\ntermed the solar cluster. And Miss Clerke observes that the actual\r\nexistence of such a cluster is indicated by the fact that 'an enumeration\r\nof the stars in photometric order discloses a systematic excess of stars\r\nbrighter than the 4th magnitude, making it certain that there is an actual\r\ncondensation in the neighbourhood of the sun--that the average allowance of\r\ncubical space per star is smaller within a sphere enclosing him with a\r\nradius, say, of 140 light-years, than further away.'[5]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting inquiry into this subject is that by Professor\r\nKapteyn of Gröningen, one of the most painstaking students of the\r\ndistribution of the stars. He founds his conclusions mainly on the proper\r\nmotions of the stars, this being the best general indication of distance in\r\nthe absence of actual determination of parallax. He made use of the proper\r\nmotions and the spectra of more than two thousand stars, and he finds that\r\na considerable body of stars having large proper motions, and also\r\npresenting the solar type of spectra, surround our sun in all directions,\r\nand show no increased density, as the more distant stars do, towards the\r\nMilky Way. He finds also that towards the centre of this cluster stars are\r\nfar closer together than near its outer limits (he says there are\r\nninety-eight times as many), that it is roughly spherical in shape, and\r\nthat the maximum compression is, as nearly as can be ascertained, at the\r\ncentre of the circle of the Milky Way, while the sun is at some distance\r\naway from this central point.[6]\r\n\r\nIt is a very suggestive fact that most of the stars belonging to this\r\ncluster have spectra of the solar type, which indicates that they are of\r\nthe same general chemical constitution as our sun, and are also at about\r\nthe same stage of evolution; and this may well have arisen from their\r\norigin in a great nebulous mass situated at or near the centre of the\r\ngalactic plane, and probably revolving round their common centre of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nAs Kapteyn's result was based on materials which were not so full or\r\nreliable as those now available, Professor S. Newcomb has examined the\r\nquestion himself, using two recent lists of stars, one limited to those\r\nhaving proper motions of 10\" a century, of which there are 295, and the\r\nother of nearly 1500 stars with 'appreciable proper motions.' They are\r\nsituated in two zones, each about 5° in breadth and cutting across the\r\nMilky Way in different parts of its course. They afford, therefore, a good\r\ntest of the distribution of these nearer stars with regard to the Galaxy.\r\nThe result is, that on the average these stars are not more numerous in or\r\nnear the Milky Way than elsewhere; and Professor Newcomb expresses himself\r\non this point as follows:--'The conclusion is interesting and important. If\r\nwe should blot out from the sky all the stars having no proper motion large\r\nenough to be detected, we should find remaining stars of all magnitudes;\r\nbut they would be scattered almost uniformly over the sky, and show little\r\nor no tendency to crowd towards the Galaxy, unless, perhaps, in the region\r\nnear 19h. of Right Ascension.'[7]\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show that, as the stars of all magnitudes which\r\nare, on the average, nearest to us are spread over the sky in 'all\r\ndirections' and 'almost uniformly,' this necessarily implies that they\r\nform a cluster or group, and that our sun is somewhere not very far from\r\nthe centre of this group. Again, Professor Newcomb refers to 'the\r\nremarkable equality in the number of stars in opposite directions from us.\r\nWe do not detect any marked difference between the numbers lying round the\r\nopposite poles of the Galaxy, nor, so far as known, between the\r\nstar-density in different regions at equal distances from the Milky Way'\r\n(_The Stars_, p. 315). And again he refers to the same question at p. 317,\r\nwhere he says: 'So far as we can judge from the enumeration of the stars in\r\nall directions, and from the aspect of the Milky Way, our system is near\r\nthe centre of the stellar universe.'\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, now be clear to my readers that the four main\r\nastronomical propositions stated in my article which appeared in the New\r\nYork _Independent_ and in the _Fortnightly Review_, and which were either\r\ndenied or declared to be unproved by my astronomical critics, have been\r\nshown to be supported by so many converging lines of evidence, that it is\r\nno longer possible to deny that they are, at least provisionally, fairly\r\nwell established. These facts are, (1) that the stellar universe is not of\r\ninfinite extent; (2) that our sun is situated in the central plane of the\r\nMilky Way; (3) that it is also situated near to the centre of that plane;\r\n(4) that we are surrounded by a group or cluster of stars of unknown\r\nextent, which occupy a place not far removed from the centre of the\r\ngalactic plane, and therefore, near to the centre of our universe of stars.\r\n\r\nNot only are these four propositions each supported by converging lines of\r\nevidence, including some which I believe have not before been adduced in\r\ntheir support, but a number of astronomers, admittedly of the first rank,\r\nhave arrived at the same conclusions as to the bearing of the evidence, and\r\nhave expressed their convictions in the clearest manner, as quoted by me.\r\nIt is _their_ conclusions which I appeal to and adopt; yet my two chief\r\nastronomical critics positively deny that there is any valid evidence of\r\nthe finiteness of the stellar universe, which one of them terms 'a myth,'\r\nand he even accuses _me_ of having started it. Both of them, however, agree\r\nin stating very strongly one objection to my main thesis--that our central\r\nposition (not necessarily at the precise centre) in the stellar universe\r\nhas a meaning and a purpose, in connection with the development of life and\r\nof man upon this earth, and, _so far as we know_, here only. With this one\r\nobjection, the only one that in my opinion has the slightest weight, I will\r\nnow proceed to deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN'S MOTION THROUGH SPACE\r\n\r\nThe two astronomers who did me the honour to criticise my original article\r\nlaid the greatest stress on the fact, that even if I had proved that the\r\nsun now occupied a nearly central position in the great star-system, it was\r\nreally of no importance whatever, because, at the rate the sun was\r\ntravelling, 'five million years ago we were deep in the actual stream of\r\nthe Milky Way; five million years hence we shall have completely crossed\r\nthe gulf which it encircles, and again be a member of one of its\r\nconstituent groups, but on the opposite side. And ten million years are\r\nregarded by geologists and biologists as but a trifle on account to meet\r\ntheir demands upon the bank of Time.' Thus speaks one of my critics. The\r\nother is equally crushing. He says:--'If there is a centre to the visible\r\nuniverse, and if we occupy it to-day, we certainly did not do so yesterday,\r\nand shall not do so to-morrow. The Solar System is known to be moving among\r\nthe stars with a velocity which would carry us to Sirius within 100,000\r\nyears, if we happened to be travelling in his direction, as we are not. In\r\nthe 50 or 100 million years during which, according to geologists, this\r\nearth has been a habitable globe, we must have passed by thousands of stars\r\non the right hand and on the left.... In his eagerness to limit the\r\nuniverse in space, Dr. Wallace has surely forgotten that it is equally\r\nimportant, for his purpose, to limit it in time; but incomparably more\r\ndifficult in the face of ascertained facts.... Indeed, so far from our\r\nhaving tranquilly enjoyed a central position in unbroken continuity for\r\nscores or perhaps hundreds of millions of years, we should in that time\r\nhave traversed the universe from boundary to boundary.'[8]\r\n\r\nNow the average reader of these two criticisms, taking account of the high\r\nofficial position of both writers, would accept their statements of the\r\ncase as being demonstrated facts, requiring no qualification whatever, and\r\nwould conclude that my whole argument had been thereby rendered worthless,\r\nand all that I founded upon it a fantastic dream. But if, on the other\r\nhand, I can show that their stated facts as to the sun's motion are by no\r\nmeans demonstrated, because founded upon assumptions which may be quite\r\nerroneous; and further, that if the facts should turn out to be\r\nsubstantially correct, they have both omitted to state well-known and\r\nadmitted qualifications which render the conclusions they derive from the\r\nfacts very doubtful, then the average reader will learn the valuable lesson\r\nthat official advocacy, whether in medicine, law, or science is never to be\r\naccepted till the other side of the case has been heard. Let us see,\r\ntherefore, what the facts really are.\r\n\r\nProfessor Simon Newcomb calculates that, if there are one hundred million\r\nstars in the stellar universe each five times the mass of our sun, and\r\nspread over a space which light would require thirty thousand years to\r\ncross, then any mass traversing such a system with a velocity of more than\r\ntwenty-five miles a second, would fly off into infinite space never to\r\nreturn. Now as there are many stars which have, apparently, very much more\r\nthan this velocity, it would follow that the visible universe is unstable.\r\nIt also implies that these great velocities were not acquired in the system\r\nitself, but that the bodies which possess them must have entered it from\r\nwithout, thus requiring other universes as the feeders of our universe.\r\n\r\nFor the accuracy of the above statement the authority of Professor Newcomb\r\nis an ample guarantee; but there may be modifications required in the data\r\non which it is founded, and these may greatly alter the result. If I do not\r\nmistake, the estimate of a hundred million stars is founded on actual\r\ncounts or estimates of stars of successive magnitudes in different parts of\r\nthe heavens, and it does not include either those of the denser star\r\nclusters nor the countless millions just beyond the reach of telescopes in\r\nthe Milky Way. Neither does it make allowance for the dark stars supposed\r\nby some astronomers to be many times more numerous than the bright ones,\r\nnor for the vast number of the nebulæ, great and small, in calculating the\r\ntotal mass of the stellar system.[9] In his latest work Professor Newcomb\r\nsays, 'The total number of stars is to be counted by hundreds of millions';\r\nand hence the controlling power of the system on bodies within it will be\r\nmany times greater than that given above, and might even be ample to retain\r\nwithin its bounds such a rapidly moving star as Arcturus, which is believed\r\nto be travelling at the rate of more than three hundred miles a second. But\r\nthere is another very important limitation to the conclusions to be drawn\r\nfrom Professor Newcomb's calculation. It assumes the stars to be nearly\r\nuniformly distributed through the whole of the space to which the system\r\nextends. But the facts are very different. The existence of clusters, some\r\nof which comprise many thousands of stars, is one example of irregularity\r\nof distribution, and any one of these larger clusters would probably be able\r\nto change the course of even the swiftest stars passing near it. The larger\r\nnebulæ might have the same effect, since the late Mr. Ranyard, taking all\r\nhis data so as to produce a minimum result, calculated the probable mass\r\nof the Orion nebula to be four and a half million times that of the sun,\r\nand there may be many other nebulæ equally large. But far more important is\r\nthe fact of the vast ring of the Milky Way, which is now universally held\r\nby astronomers to be, not only apparently but really, more densely crowded\r\nwith stars and also with vast masses of nebulous matter than any other part\r\nof the heavens, so that it may possibly comprise within itself a very large\r\nproportion of the whole of the matter of the visible universe. This is\r\nrendered more probable by the fact that the great majority of star-clusters\r\nlie along its course, most of the huge gaseous stars belong to it, while\r\nthe occurrence there only of 'new stars' is evidence of a superabundance of\r\nmatter in various forms leading to frequent heat-producing collisions, just\r\nas the frequent occurrence of meteoric showers on our earth is evidence of\r\nthe superabundance of meteoric matter in the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised by mathematicians that within any great system of bodies\r\nsubject to the law of gravitation there can be no such thing as motion of\r\nany of them in a straight line; neither can any amount of motion arise\r\nwithin such a system through the action of gravitation alone capable of\r\ncarrying any of its masses out of the system. The ultimate tendency must be\r\ntowards concentration rather than towards dispersal.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, only reasonable to consider whatever motions and\r\nwhatever velocities we find among the stars, as having been produced by the\r\ngravitative power of the larger aggregations, modified perhaps by\r\nelectrical repulsive forces, by collisions, and by the results of those\r\ncollisions; and we may look to the changes now visibly going on in some of\r\nthe nebulæ and clusters as indications of the forces that have probably\r\nbrought about the actual condition of the whole stellar universe.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the beautiful photographs of nebulæ by Dr. Roberts and other\r\nobservers, we find that they are of many forms. Some are extremely\r\nirregular and almost like patches of cirrus clouds, but a large number are\r\neither distinctly spiral in form, or show indications of becoming spiral,\r\nand this has been found to be the case even with some of the large\r\nirregular nebula. Then again we have numerous ring-formed nebulæ, usually\r\nwith a star involved in dense nebulosity in the centre, separated by a dark\r\nspace of various widths from the outer ring. All these kinds of nebulæ have\r\nstars involved in them, and apparently forming part of their structure,\r\nwhile others which do not differ in appearance from ordinary stars are\r\nbelieved by Dr. Roberts to lie between us and the nebula. In the case of\r\nmany of the spiral nebulæ, stars are often strung along the coils of the\r\nspiral, while other curved lines of stars are seen just outside the nebula,\r\nso that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that both are really\r\nconnected with it, the outer lines of stars indicating a former greater\r\nextension of the nebula whose material has been used up in the growth of\r\nthese stars. Some of these spiral nebulæ show beautifully regular\r\nconvolutions, and these usually have a large central star like mass, as in\r\nM. 100 Comæ and I. 84 Comæ, in Vol. II. Pl. 14 of Dr. Roberts's\r\nphotographs. The straight white streaks across the nebula of the Pleiades\r\nand some others are believed by Dr. Roberts to be indications of spiral\r\nnebulæ seen edgewise. In other cases, clusters of stars are more or less\r\nnebulous, and the arrangement of the stars seems to indicate their\r\ndevelopment from a spiral nebula. It is to be noted that many of the\r\nobjects classed as planetary nebulæ by Sir John Herschel are shown by the\r\nbest photographs to be really of the ring-type, though often with a very\r\nnarrow division between the ring and the central mass. This form may\r\ntherefore be of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut if this annular form with some kind of central nucleus, often very\r\nlarge, is produced under certain conditions by the action of the ordinary\r\nlaws of motion upon more or less extensive masses of discrete matter, why\r\nmay not the same laws acting upon similar matter once dispersed over the\r\nwhole extent of the existing stellar universe, or even beyond what are now\r\nits farthest limits, have led to the aggregation of the vast annular\r\nformation of the Milky Way, with all the subordinate centres of\r\nconcentration or dispersal to be found within or around it? And if this is\r\na reasonable conception, may we not hope that by a concentration of\r\nattention upon a few of the best marked and most favourably situated\r\nannular and spiral systems, sufficient knowledge of their internal motions\r\nmay be obtained which may serve as a guide to the kind of motion we may\r\nexpect to find in the great galactic ring and its subordinate stars? We may\r\nthen perhaps discover which now seem so erratic, are really all parts of a\r\nseries of orbital movements limited and controlled by the forces of the\r\ngreat system to which they belong, so that, if not mathematically stable,\r\nthey may yet be sufficiently so to endure for some thousand millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive fact that the calculated position of the 'solar\r\napex'--the point towards which our sun appears to move--is now found to be\r\nmuch more nearly in the plane of the Milky Way than the position first\r\nassigned to it, and Professor Newcomb adopts, as most likely to be\r\naccurate, a point near the bright star Vega in the constellation Lyra.\r\nOther calculators have placed it still farther east, while Rancken and Otto\r\nStumpe assign it a position actually in the Milky Way; and Mr. G.C. Bompas\r\nconcludes that the sun's plane of motion nearly coincides with that of the\r\nGalaxy. M. Rancken found that 106 stars near the Milky Way showed, in their\r\nvery small proper motions, a drift along it in a direction from Cassiopeiæ\r\ntowards Orion, and this, it is supposed, may be partly due to our sun's\r\nmotion in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIn many other parts of the heavens there are groups of stars which have\r\nalmost identical proper motions--a phenomenon which the late R.A. Proctor\r\ntermed 'star-drift'; and he especially pointed out that five of the stars\r\nof the Great Bear were all drifting in the same direction; and although\r\nthis has been denied by later writers, Professor Newcomb, in his recent\r\nbook on _The Stars_, declares that Proctor was right, and explains that the\r\nerror of his critics was due to not making allowance for the divergence of\r\nthe circles of right ascension. The Pleiades are another group, the stars\r\nof which drift in the same direction, and it is a most suggestive fact that\r\nphotographs now show this cluster to be embedded in a vast nebula, which,\r\ntherefore, has also a proper motion; but some of the smaller stars do not\r\npartake of it. Three stars in Cassiopeiæ also move together, and no doubt\r\nmany other similarly connected groups remain to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThese facts have a very important bearing on the question of the motion of\r\nour sun in space. For this motion has been determined by comparing the\r\nmotions of large numbers of stars which are assumed to be wholly\r\nindependent of each other, and to move, as it were, at random. Miss A.M.\r\nClerke, in her _System of the Stars_, puts this point very clearly, as\r\nfollows: 'For the assumption that the absolute movements of the stars have\r\nno preference for one direction over another, forms the basis of all\r\ninvestigations hitherto conducted into the translatory advance of the solar\r\nsystem. The little fabric of laboriously acquired knowledge regarding it at\r\nonce crumbles if that basis has to be removed. In all investigations of the\r\nsun's movement, the movements of the stars have been regarded as casual\r\nirregularities; should they prove to be in any visible degree systematic,\r\nthe mode of treatment adopted (and there is no other at present open to us)\r\nbecomes invalid, and its results null and void. The point is then of\r\nsingular interest, and the evidence bearing upon it deserves our utmost\r\nattention.'\r\n\r\nMr. W.H.S. Monck, a well-known astronomer, takes the same view. He says:\r\n'The proof of this motion rests on the assumption that if we take a\r\nsufficient number of stars, their real motions in all directions will be\r\nequal, and that therefore the apparent preponderances which we observe in\r\nparticular directions result from the real motion of the sun. But there is\r\nno impossibility in a systematic motion of the majority of the stars used\r\nin these researches which might reconcile the observed facts with a\r\nmotionless sun. And, in the second place, if the sun is not in the exact\r\ncentre of gravity of the universe, we might expect him to be moving in an\r\norbit around this centre of gravity, and our observations on his actual\r\nmotion are not sufficiently numerous or accurate to enable us to affirm\r\nthat he is moving in a right line rather than such an orbit.'\r\n\r\nNow this 'systematic motion,' which would render all calculations as to the\r\nsun's motion inaccurate or even altogether worthless, is by many\r\nastronomers held to be an observed reality. The star-drift, first pointed\r\nout by Proctor, has been shown to exist in many other groups of stars,\r\nwhile the curious arrangements of stars all over the heavens in straight\r\nlines, or regular curves, or spirals, strongly suggests a wide extension of\r\nthe same kind of relation. But even more extensive systematic movements\r\nhave been observed or suggested by astronomers. Sir D. Gill, by an\r\nextensive research, believes that he has found indications of a rotation of\r\nthe brighter fixed stars as a whole in regard to the fainter fixed stars as\r\na whole. Mr. Maxwell Hall has also found indications of a movement of a\r\nlarge group of stars, including our sun, around a common centre, situated\r\nin a direction towards Epsilon Andromedæ, and at a distance of about 490\r\nyears of light-travel. These last two motions are not yet established; but\r\nthey seem to prove two important facts--(_a_) that eminent astronomers\r\nbelieve that _some_ systematic motions must exist among the stars, or they\r\nwould not devote so much labour to the search for them; and (_b_) that\r\nextensive systematic motions of some kind do exist, or even these results\r\nwould not have been obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. W.W. Campbell, of the Lick Observatory, thus remarks on the uncertainty\r\nof determinations of the sun's motions: 'The motion of the solar system is\r\na purely relative quantity. It refers to specified groups of stars. The\r\nresults for various groups may differ widely, and all be correct. It would\r\nbe easy to select a group of stars with reference to which the solar motion\r\nwould be reversed 180° from the values assigned above' (_Astrophysical\r\nJournal_, vol. xiii. p. 87. 1901).\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that, within a uniform cluster of stars, each moving\r\nround the common centre of gravity of the whole cluster, Kepler's laws do\r\nnot prevail, the law being that the angular velocities are all identical,\r\nso that the more distant stars move faster than those nearer the centre,\r\nsubject to modifications, however, due to the varying density of the\r\ncluster. But if the cluster is nearly globular, there must be stars moving\r\nround the centre in every plane, and this would lead to apparent motions in\r\nmany directions as viewed by us, although those which were moving in the\r\nsame plane as ourselves would, when compared with remote stars outside the\r\ncluster, appear to be all moving in the same direction and at the same\r\nrate, forming, in fact, one of those drifting systems of stars already\r\nreferred to. Again, if in the process of formation of our cluster, smaller\r\naggregations already having a rotatory motion were drawn into it, this\r\nmight lead to their revolving in an opposite direction to those which were\r\nformed from the original nebula, thus increasing the diversities of\r\napparent motion.\r\n\r\nThe evidence now briefly set forth fully justifies, I submit, the remarks\r\nas to the statements of my astronomical critics at the beginning of this\r\nsection. They have both given the accepted views as to direction and rate\r\nof movement of our sun without any qualification whatever, as if they were\r\nastronomical facts of the same certainty and the same degree of accuracy as\r\nthe sun's distance from the earth; and they will assuredly have been so\r\nunderstood by the great body of non-mathematical readers. It appears,\r\nhowever, if the authorities I have quoted are right, that the whole\r\ncalculation rests upon certain assumptions, which are certainly to some\r\nextent, and may be to a very large extent, erroneous. This is my reply to\r\none part of their criticism.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, they both assert, or imply, not only that the sun's\r\nmotion is now in a straight line, but that it has been in a straight line\r\nfrom some enormously remote period when it first entered the stellar system\r\non one side, and will so continue to move till it reaches the utmost bounds\r\nof that system on the other side. And this is stated by them both, not as a\r\npossibility, but as a certainty. They use such terms as 'must' and 'will\r\nbe,' leaving no room for any doubt whatever. But such a result implies the\r\nabrogation of the law of gravitation, since under its action motion in a\r\nstraight line in the midst of thousands or millions of suns of various\r\nsizes is an absolute impossibility; while it also implies that the sun must\r\nhave been started on its course from some other system outside the Milky\r\nWay, with such a precise determination of direction as not to collide with,\r\nor even make a near approach to, any one of the suns or clusters of suns,\r\nor vast nebulous masses, during its passage through the very midst of the\r\nstellar universe.\r\n\r\nThis is my reply to the main point of their criticism, and I think I am\r\njustified in saying that nothing in my whole article is so demonstrably\r\nbaseless as the statements I have now examined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsidering then the whole bearing of the evidence, I refuse to accept the\r\nunsupported dicta of those who would have us believe that our admitted\r\nposition not far from the centre of the stellar universe is a mere\r\ntemporary coincidence of no significance whatever; or that our sun and\r\nhosts of other similar orbs near to us have come together by an accident,\r\nand are being dispersed into surrounding space, never to meet again. Until\r\nthis is proved by indisputable evidence, it seems to me far more probable\r\nthat we are moving in an orbit of some kind around the centre of gravity of\r\na vast cluster, as determined by the investigations of Kapteyn, Newcomb,\r\nand other astronomers; and, consequently, that the nearly central position\r\nwe now occupy may be a permanent one. For even if our sun's orbit should\r\nhave a diameter a thousand times that of Neptune, it would be but a small\r\nfraction of the diameter of the Milky Way; while so vast is the scale of\r\nour universe, that it might be even a hundred thousand times as great and\r\nstill leave us deeply immersed in the solar cluster, and very much nearer\r\nto the dense central portion than to its more diffused outer regions.\r\n\r\nHere the subject may be left for the present. After having studied the\r\nevidence afforded by the essential conditions of life-development on the\r\nearth, and the numerous indications that these conditions do not exist on\r\nany of the other planets of the solar system, it may be again touched upon\r\nin a general review of the conclusions arrived at.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Nature_, October 26, 1899.\r\n\r\n[5] _The System of the Stars_, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[6] This account of Professor Kapteyn's research is taken from an article\r\nby Miss A.M. Clerke in _Knowledge_, April 1893.\r\n\r\n[7] _The Stars_, p. 256. The region here referred to is that where the\r\nMilky Way has its greatest width (though nearly as wide in the part exactly\r\nopposite), and where it may perhaps extend somewhat in our direction. Miss\r\nA.M. Clerke informs me that in April 1901 Kapteyn withdrew the conclusions\r\narrived at in 1893, as being founded on illegitimate reasoning as to the\r\nrelation of parallaxes to proper motions. But as this relation is still\r\naccepted, under certain limitations, by Professor Newcomb and other\r\nastronomers, who have arrived independently at very similar results, it\r\nseems not improbable that, after all, Professor Kapteyn's conclusions may\r\nnot require very much modification. Professor Newcomb also tells us (_The\r\nStars_, p. 214, footnote) that he has seen the latest of Professor\r\nKapteyn's papers, down to 1901; but he does not therefore express any doubt\r\nas to his own conclusions as here referred to.\r\n\r\n[8] See _Knowledge_ and _The Fortnightly Review_ of April 1903.\r\n\r\n[9] Sir R. Ball in an article in _Good Words_ (April 1903) says that\r\nluminosity is an exceptional phenomenon in nature, and that luminous stars\r\nare but the glow-worms and fire-flies of the universe, as compared with the\r\nmyriads of other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE UNIFORMITY OF MATTER AND ITS LAWS THROUGHOUT THE STELLAR UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have shown in the second chapter of this work that none of the previous\r\nwriters on the question of the habitability of the other planets have\r\nreally dealt with the subject in any adequate manner, since not only do\r\nthey appear to be quite unaware of the delicate balance of conditions which\r\nalone renders organic life possible on any planet, but they have altogether\r\nomitted any reference to the fact that not only must the conditions be such\r\nas to render life possible _now_, but these conditions must have persisted\r\nduring the long geological epochs needed for the slow development of life\r\nfrom its most rudimentary forms. It will therefore be necessary to enter\r\ninto some details both as to the physical and chemical essentials for a\r\ncontinuous development of organic life, and also into the combination of\r\nmechanical and physical conditions which are required on any planet to\r\nrender such life possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNIFORMITY OF MATTER\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and far-reaching of the discoveries due to the\r\nspectroscope is that of the wonderful identity of the elements and\r\nmaterial compounds in earth and sun, stars and nebulæ, and also of the\r\nidentity of the physical and chemical laws that determine the states and\r\nforms assumed by matter. More than half the total number of the known\r\nelements have been already detected in the sun, including all those which\r\ncompose the bulk of the earth's solid material, with the one exception of\r\noxygen. This is a very large proportion when we consider the very peculiar\r\nconditions which enable us to detect them. For we can only recognise an\r\nelement in the sun when it exists at its surface in an incandescent state,\r\nand also above its surface in the form of a somewhat cooler gas. Many of\r\nthe elements may rarely or never be brought to the surface of so vast a\r\nbody, or if they do sometimes appear there, it may not be in sufficient\r\nquantity or in sufficient purity to produce any bands in the spectroscope,\r\nwhile the cooler gas or vapour may either not be present, or be so\r\ndispersed as not to produce sufficient absorption to render its spectral\r\nlines visible. Again, it is believed that many elements are dissociated by\r\nthe intense heat of the sun, and may not be recognisable by us, or they may\r\nonly exist at its surface in a compound form unknown on the earth; and in\r\nsome such way those lines of the solar spectrum which remain still\r\nunrecognised may have been produced. One of these unknown lines was that of\r\nHelium, a gas found soon afterwards in the rare mineral 'Cleveite,' and\r\nsince detected frequently in many stars. Some of the stars have spectra\r\nvery closely resembling that of the sun. The dark lines are almost as\r\nnumerous, and most of them correspond accurately with solar lines, so that\r\nwe cannot doubt their having almost exactly the same chemical constitution,\r\nand being also in the same condition as regards heat and stage of\r\ndevelopment. Other stars, as we have already stated, exhibit mainly lines\r\nof hydrogen, sometimes combined with fine metallic lines. Of the spectra of\r\nthe nebulæ comparatively little is known, but many are decidedly gaseous,\r\nwhile others show a continuous spectrum indicating a more complex\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nBut we also obtain considerable knowledge of the matter of non-terrestrial\r\nbodies by the analysis of the numerous meteorites which fall upon the\r\nearth. Most of these belong to some of the many meteoric streams which\r\ncirculate round the sun, and which may be supposed to give us samples of\r\nplanetary matter. But as it is now believed that many of them are produced\r\nby the debris of comets, and the orbits of some of these indicate that they\r\nhave come from stellar space and have been drawn into our system by the\r\nattractive power of the larger planets, it is almost certain that the\r\nmeteoric stones not infrequently bring us matter from the remoter regions\r\nof space, and probably afford us samples of the solid constituents of\r\nnebula; or the cooler stars. It is, therefore, a most suggestive fact that\r\nnone of these meteorites have been found to contain a single\r\nnon-terrestrial element, although no less than twenty-four elements have\r\nbeen found in them, and it will be of interest to give the list of these,\r\nas follows:--_Oxygen_, Hydrogen, _Chlorine_, _Sulphur_, _Phosphorus_,\r\nCarbon, Silicon, Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, Magnesium, Chromium, Manganese,\r\nCopper, Tin, _Antimony_, Aluminium, Calcium, Potassium, Sodium, _Lithium_,\r\nTitanium, _Arsenic_, and Vanadium. Seven of the above, printed in italics,\r\nhave not yet been found in the sun, such as Oxygen, Chlorine, Sulphur, and\r\nPhosphorus, which form the constituents of many widespread minerals, and\r\nthey supply important gaps in the series of solar and stellar elements. It\r\nmay be noted that although meteorites have supplied no new elements, they\r\nhave furnished examples of some new combinations of these elements forming\r\nminerals distinct from any found in our rocks.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the occurrence in meteorites not only of minerals which are\r\npeculiar to them or are found on the earth, but also of structures\r\nresembling our breccias, veins, and even slicken-side surfaces, has been\r\nheld to be opposed to the meteoritic theory of the origin of suns and\r\nplanets, because meteorites seem to be thus proved to be the fragments of\r\nsuns or worlds, not their primary constituents. But these cases are\r\nexceptional, and Mr. Sorby, who made a special study of meteorites,\r\nconcluded that their materials have usually been in a state of fusion or\r\neven of vapour, as they now exist in the sun, and that they became\r\ncondensed into minute globular particles, which afterwards collected into\r\nlarger masses, and may have been broken up by mutual impact, and again and\r\nagain become aggregated together--thus presenting features which are\r\ncompletely in accordance with the meteoritic theory.\r\n\r\nBut, quite recently, Mr. T.C. Chamberlin has applied the theory of tidal\r\ndistortion to showing how solid bodies in space, without ever coming into\r\nactual contact, must sometimes be torn apart or disrupted into numerous\r\nfragments by passing near to each other. Especially when a small body\r\npasses near a much larger one, there is a certain distance of approach\r\n(termed the Roche limit) when the increasing differential force of gravity\r\nwill be sufficient to tear asunder the smaller body and cause the fragments\r\neither to circulate around it or to be dispersed in space.[10] In this way,\r\ntherefore, those larger meteorites which exhibit planetary structure may\r\nhave been produced. Of course they would rarely have been true planets\r\nattached to a sun, but more frequently some of the smaller dark suns, which\r\nmay possess many of the physical characteristics of planets, and of which\r\nthere may be myriads in the stellar spaces.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we have positive knowledge of the existence, in the\r\nsun, stars, and planetary and stellar spaces, of such a large proportion of\r\nthe elements of our globe, and so few indications of any not forming part\r\nof it, that we are justified in the statement, that the whole stellar\r\nuniverse is, broadly speaking, constructed of the same series of elementary\r\nsubstances as those we can study upon our earth, and of which the whole\r\nrealm of nature, animal, vegetable, and mineral, is composed. The evidence\r\nof this identity of substance is really far more complete than we could\r\nexpect, considering the very limited means of inquiry that we possess; and\r\nwe shall, therefore, not be justified in assuming that any important\r\ndifference exists.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the elements of matter to the laws which govern it, we\r\nalso find the clearest proofs of identity. That the fundamental law of\r\ngravitation extends to the whole physical universe is rendered almost\r\ncertain by the fact that double stars move round their common centre of\r\ngravity in elliptical orbits which correspond well with both observation\r\nand calculation. That the laws of light are the same both here and in\r\ninter-planetary space is indicated by the fact that the actual measurement\r\nof the velocity of light on the earth's surface gives a result so\r\ncompletely identical with that prevailing to the limits of the solar\r\nsystem, that the measurement of the sun's distance, by means of the\r\neclipses of Jupiter's satellites combined with the measured velocity of\r\nlight, agrees almost exactly with that obtained by means of the transits of\r\nVenus, or through our nearest approach to the planets Mars or Eros.\r\n\r\nAgain, the more recondite laws of light are found to be identical in sun\r\nand stars with those observed within the narrow bounds of laboratory\r\nexperiments. The minute change of position of spectral lines caused by the\r\nsource of light moving towards or away from us enables us to determine this\r\nkind of motion in the most distant stars, in the planets, or in the moon,\r\nand these results can be tested by the motion of the earth either in its\r\norbit or in its rotation; and these latter tests agree with the theoretical\r\ndetermination of what must occur, dependent on the wave-lengths of the\r\ndifferent dark lines of the solar spectrum determined by measurements in\r\nthe laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, minute changes in the widening or narrowing of spectral\r\nlines, their splitting up, their increase or decrease in number, and their\r\narrangement so as to form flutings, can all be interpreted by experiments\r\nin the laboratory, showing that such phenomena are due to alterations of\r\ntemperature, of pressure, or of the magnetic field, thus proving that the\r\nvery same physical and chemical laws act in the same way here and in the\r\nremotest depths of space.\r\n\r\nThese various discoveries give us the certain conviction that the whole\r\nmaterial universe is essentially one, both as regards the action of\r\nphysical and chemical laws, and also in its mechanical relations of form\r\nand structure. It consists throughout of the very same elements with which\r\nwe are so familiar on our earth; the same ether whose vibrations bring us\r\nlight and heat, electricity and magnetism, and a whole host of other\r\nmysterious and as yet imperfectly known forces; gravitation acts throughout\r\nits vast extent; and in whatever direction and by whatever means we obtain\r\na knowledge of the stellar universe, we find the same mechanical, physical,\r\nand chemical laws prevailing as upon our earth, so that we have in some\r\ncases been actually enabled to reproduce in our laboratories phenomena with\r\nwhich we had first become acquainted in the sun or among the stars.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore feel it to be an almost certain conclusion that--the\r\nelements being the same, the laws which act upon, and combine, and modify\r\nthose elements being the same--organised living beings wherever they may\r\nexist in this universe must be, fundamentally, and in essential nature, the\r\nsame also. The outward forms of life, if they exist elsewhere, may vary\r\nalmost infinitely, as they do vary on the earth; but, throughout all this\r\nvariety of form--from fungus or moss to rose-bush, palm or oak; from\r\nmollusc, worm, or butterfly to humming-bird, elephant, or man--the\r\nbiologist recognises a fundamental unity of substance and of structure,\r\ndependent on the absolute requirements of the growing, moving, developing,\r\nliving organism, built up of the same elements, combined in the same\r\nproportions, and subject to the same laws. We do not say that organic life\r\n_could_ not exist under altogether diverse conditions from those which we\r\nknow or can conceive, conditions which may prevail in other universes\r\nconstructed quite differently from ours, where other substances replace the\r\nmatter and ether of our universe, and where other laws prevail. But,\r\n_within_ the universe we know, there is not the slightest reason to suppose\r\norganic life to be possible, except under the same general conditions and\r\nlaws which prevail here. We will, therefore, now proceed to describe, very\r\ngenerally, what are the conditions essential to the existence and the\r\ncontinuous development of vegetable and animal life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[10] _The Astrophysical Journal_, vol. xiv., July 1901, p. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERS OF THE LIVING ORGANISM\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore trying to comprehend the physical conditions on any planet which are\r\nessential for the development and maintenance of a varied and complex\r\nsystem of organic life comparable to that of our earth, we must obtain some\r\nknowledge of what life is, and of the fundamental nature and properties of\r\nthe living organism.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists and philosophers have made many attempts to define 'life,'\r\nbut in most cases in aiming at absolute generality they have been vague and\r\nuninstructive. Thus De Blainville defined it as 'The twofold internal\r\nmovement of composition and decomposition, at once general and continuous';\r\nwhile Herbert Spencer's latest definition was 'Life is the continuous\r\nadjustment of internal relations to external relations.' But neither of\r\nthese is sufficiently precise, explanatory, or distinctive, and they might\r\nalmost be applied to the changes occurring in a sun or planet, or to the\r\nelevation and gradual formation of a continent. One of the oldest\r\ndefinitions, that of Aristotle, seems to come nearer the mark: 'Life is the\r\nassemblage of the operations of nutrition, growth, and destruction.' But\r\nthese definitions of 'life' are unsatisfactory, because they apply to an\r\nabstract idea rather than to the actual living organism. The marvel and\r\nmystery of life, as we know it, resides in the body which manifests it, and\r\nthis living body the definitions ignore.\r\n\r\nThe essential points in the living body, as seen in its higher\r\ndevelopments, are, first, that it consists throughout of highly complex but\r\nvery unstable forms of matter, every particle of which is in a continual\r\nstate of growth or decay; that it absorbs or appropriates dead matter from\r\nwithout; takes this matter into the interior of its body; acts upon it\r\nmechanically and chemically, rejecting what is useless or hurtful; and so\r\ntransforming the remainder as to renew every atom of its own structure\r\ninternal and external, at the same time throwing off, particle by particle,\r\nall the worn-out or dead portions of its own substance. Secondly, in order\r\nto be able to do all this, its whole body is permeated throughout by\r\nbranching vessels or porous tissues, by which liquids and gases can reach\r\nevery part and carry on the various processes of nutrition and excretion\r\nabove referred to. As Professor Burdon Sanderson well puts it: 'The most\r\ndistinctive peculiarity of living matter as compared with non-living is,\r\nthat it is ever changing while ever the same.' And these changes are the\r\nmore remarkable because they are accompanied, and even produced, by a very\r\nlarge amount of mechanical work--in animals by means of their normal\r\nactivities in search of food, in assimilating that food, in continually\r\nrenewing and building up their whole organism, and in many other ways; in\r\nplants by building up their structure, which often involves raising tons of\r\nmaterial high into the air, as in forest trees. As a recent writer puts\r\nit: 'The most prominent, and perhaps the most fundamental, phenomenon of\r\nlife is what may be described as the _Energy Traffic_ or the function of\r\n_trading in energy_. The chief physical function of living matter seems to\r\nconsist in absorbing energy, storing it in a higher potential state, and\r\nafterwards partially expending it in the kinetic or active form.'[11]\r\n\r\nThirdly--and perhaps most marvellous of all--all living organisms have the\r\npower of reproduction or increase, in the lowest forms by a process of\r\nself-division or 'fission,' as it is termed, in the higher by means of\r\nreproductive cells, which, though in their earliest stage quite\r\nindistinguishable physically or chemically in very different species, yet\r\npossess the mysterious power of developing a perfect organism, identical\r\nwith its parents in all its parts, shapes, and organs, and so wonderfully\r\nresembling them, that the minutest distinctive details of size, form, and\r\ncolour, in hair or feathers, in teeth or claws, in scales, spines, or\r\ncrests, are reproduced with very close accuracy, though often involving\r\nmetamorphic changes during growth of so strange a nature that, if they were\r\nnot familiar to us but were narrated as occurring only in some distant and\r\nalmost inaccessible region, would be treated as travellers' tales,\r\nincredible and impossible as those of Sindbad the Sailor.\r\n\r\nIn order that the substance of living bodies should be able to undergo\r\nthese constant changes while preserving the same form and structure in\r\nminute details--that they should be, as it were, in a constant state of\r\nflux while remaining sensibly unchanged, it is necessary that the molecules\r\nof which they are built up should be so combined as to be easily separated\r\nand as easily united--be, as it is termed, _labile_ or flowing; and this is\r\nbrought about by their chemical composition, which, while consisting of few\r\nelements, is yet highly complex in structure, a large number of chemical\r\natoms being combined in an endless variety of ways.\r\n\r\nThe physical basis of life, as Huxley termed it, is protoplasm, a substance\r\nwhich consists essentially of only four common elements, the three gases,\r\nnitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, with the non-metallic solid, carbon; hence\r\nall the special products of plants and animals are termed carbon-compounds,\r\nand their study constitutes one of the most extensive and intricate\r\nbranches of modern chemistry. Their complexity is indicated by the fact\r\nthat the molecule of sugar contains 45, and that of stearine no less than\r\n173, constituent atoms. The chemical compounds of carbon are far more\r\nnumerous than those of all the other chemical elements combined; and it is\r\nthis wonderful variety and the complexity of its possible combinations\r\nwhich explain the fact, that all the various animal tissues--skin, horn,\r\nhair, nails, teeth, muscle, nerve, etc., consist of the same four elements\r\n(with occasionally minute quantities of sulphur, phosphorus, lime, or\r\nsilica, in some of them), as proved by the marvellous fact that these\r\ntissues are all produced as well by the grass-eating sheep or ox as by the\r\nfish or flesh-eating seal or tiger. And the marvel is still further\r\nincreased when we consider that the innumerable diverse substances produced\r\nby plants and animals are all formed out of the same three or four\r\nelements. Such are the endless variety of organic acids, from prussic acid\r\nto those of the various fruits; the many kinds of sugars, gums, and\r\nstarches; the number of different kinds of oil, wax, etc.; the variety of\r\nessential oils which are mostly forms of turpentines, with such substances\r\nas camphor, resins, caoutchouc, and gutta-percha; and the extensive series\r\nof vegetable alkaloids, such as nicotine from tobacco, morphine from opium,\r\nstrychnine, curarine, and other poisons; quinine, belladonna, and similar\r\nmedicinal alkaloids; together with the essential principles of our\r\nrefreshing drinks, tea, coffee, and cocoa, and others too numerous to be\r\nnamed here--all alike consisting solely of the four common elements from\r\nwhich almost our whole organism is built up. If this were not indisputably\r\nproved, it would scarcely be credited.\r\n\r\nProfessor F.J. Allen considers that the most important element in\r\nprotoplasm, and that which confers upon it its most essential properties in\r\nthe living organism--its extreme mobility and transposibility--is nitrogen.\r\nThis element, though inert in itself, readily enters into compounds when\r\nenergy is supplied to it, the most striking illustration of which is the\r\nformation of ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, produced by\r\nelectric discharges through the atmosphere. Ammonia, and certain oxides of\r\nnitrogen produced in the atmosphere in the same way, are the chief sources\r\nof the nitrogen assimilated by plants, and through them by animals; for\r\nalthough plants are continually in contact with the free nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere, they are unable to absorb it. By their leaves they absorb\r\noxygen and carbon-dioxide to build up their woody tissues, while by their\r\nroots they absorb water in which ammonia and oxides of nitrogen are\r\ndissolved, and from these they produce the protoplasm which builds up the\r\nwhole substance of the animal world. The energy required to produce these\r\nnitrogen-compounds is given up by them when undergoing further changes, and\r\nthus the production of ammonia by electricity in the atmosphere, and its\r\nbeing carried by rain into the soil, constitute the first steps in that\r\nlong series of operations which culminates in the production of the higher\r\nforms of life.\r\n\r\nBut the remarkable transformations and combinations continually going on in\r\nevery living body, which are, in fact, the essential conditions of its\r\nlife, are themselves dependent on certain physical conditions which must be\r\nalways present. Professor Allen remarks: 'The sensitiveness of nitrogen,\r\nits proneness to change its state of combination and energy, appear to\r\ndepend on certain conditions of temperature, pressure, etc., which exist at\r\nthe surface of this earth. Most vital phenomena occur between the\r\ntemperature of freezing water and 104° F. If the general temperature of the\r\nearth's surface rose or fell 72° F. (a small amount relatively), the whole\r\ncourse of life would be changed, even perchance to extinction.'\r\n\r\nAnother important, and even more essential fact, in connection with life,\r\nis the existence in the atmosphere of a small but nearly constant\r\nproportion of carbonic acid gas, this being the source from which the whole\r\nof the carbon in the vegetable and animal kingdoms is primarily derived.\r\nThe leaves of plants absorb carbonic acid gas from the atmosphere, and the\r\npeculiar substance, chlorophyll, from which they derive their green colour,\r\nhas the power, under the influence of sunlight, to decompose it, using the\r\ncarbon to build up its own structure and giving out the oxygen. In the\r\nlaboratory the carbon can only be separated from the oxygen by the\r\napplication of heat, under which certain metals burn by combining with the\r\noxygen, thus setting free the carbon. Chlorophyll has a highly complex\r\nchemical structure very imperfectly known, but it is said to be only\r\nproduced when there is iron in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of plants, so often looked upon as mere ornamental appendages,\r\nare among the most marvellous structures in living organisms, since in\r\ndecomposing carbonic acid at ordinary temperatures they do what no other\r\nagency in nature can perform. In doing this they utilise a special group of\r\nether-waves which alone appear to have this power. The complexity of the\r\nprocesses going on in leaves is well indicated in the following\r\nquotation:--\r\n\r\n'We have seen how green leaves are supplied with gases, water, and\r\ndissolved salts, and how they can trap special ether-waves. The active\r\nenergy of these waves is used to transmute the simple inorganic compounds\r\ninto complex organic ones, which in the process of respiration are reduced\r\nto simpler substances again, and the potential energy transformed into\r\nkinetic. These metabolic changes take place in living cells full of intense\r\nactivities. Currents course through the protoplasm and cell-sap in every\r\ndirection, and between the cells which are also united by strands of\r\nprotoplasm. The gases used and given off in respiration and assimilation\r\nare floated in and out, and each protoplasm particle burned or unburned is\r\nthe centre of an area of disturbance. Pure protoplasm is influenced equally\r\nby all rays: that associated with chlorophyll is affected by certain red\r\nand violet rays in particular. These, especially the red ones, bring about\r\nthe dissociation of the elements of the carbonic acid, the assimilation of\r\nthe carbon, and the excretion of the oxygen.'[12]\r\n\r\nIt is this vigorous life-activity ever at work in the leaves, the roots,\r\nand the sap-cells, that builds up the plant, in all its wondrous beauty of\r\nbud and foliage, flower and fruit; and at the same time produces, either as\r\nuseful or waste-products, all that wealth of odours and flavours, of\r\ncolours and textures, of fibres and varied woods, of roots and tubers, of\r\ngums and oils and resins innumerable, that, taken altogether, render the\r\nworld of vegetable life perhaps more varied, more beautiful, more\r\nenjoyable, more indispensable to our higher nature than even that of\r\nanimals. But there is really no comparison between them. We _could_ have\r\nplants without animals; we could _not_ have animals without plants. And all\r\nthis marvel and mystery of vegetable life, a mystery which we rarely ponder\r\nover because its effects are so familiar, is usually held to be\r\nsufficiently explained by the statement that it is all due to the special\r\nproperties of protoplasm. Well might Huxley say, that protoplasm is not\r\nonly a substance but a structure or mechanism, a mechanism kept at work by\r\nsolar heat and light, and capable of producing a thousand times more varied\r\nand marvellous results than all the human mechanism ever invented.\r\n\r\nBut besides absorbing carbonic acid from the atmosphere, separating and\r\nutilising the carbon and giving out the oxygen, plants as well as animals\r\ncontinually absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, and this is so universally\r\nthe case that oxygen is said to be the food of protoplasm, without which it\r\ncannot continue to live; and it is the peculiar but quite invisible\r\nstructure of the protoplasm which enables it to do this, and also in plants\r\nto absorb an enormous amount of water as well.\r\n\r\nBut although protoplasm is so complex chemically as to defy exact analysis,\r\nbeing an elaborate structure of atoms built up into a molecule in which\r\neach atom must occupy its true place (like every carved stone in a Gothic\r\ncathedral), yet it is, as it were, only the starting-point or material out\r\nof which the infinitely varied structures of living bodies are formed. The\r\nextreme mobility and changeability of the structure of these molecules\r\nenables the protoplasm to be continually modified both in constitution and\r\nform, and, by the substitution or addition of other elements, to serve\r\nspecial purposes. Thus when sulphur in small quantities is absorbed and\r\nbuilt into the molecular structure, proteids are formed. These are most\r\nabundant in animal structures, and give the nourishing properties to meat,\r\ncheese, eggs, and other animal foods; but they are also found in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, especially in nuts and seeds such as grain, peas, etc.\r\nThese are generally known as nitrogenous foods, and are very nutritious,\r\nbut not so easily digestible as meat. Proteids exist in very varied forms\r\nand often contain phosphorus as well as sulphur, but their main\r\ncharacteristic is the large proportion of nitrogen they contain, while many\r\nother animal and vegetable products, as most roots, tubers, and grains, and\r\neven fats and oils, are mainly composed of starch and sugar. In its\r\nchemical and physiological aspects protein is thus described by Professor\r\nW.D. Haliburton:--'Proteids are produced only in the living laboratory of\r\nanimals and plants; proteid matter is the all-important material present in\r\nprotoplasm. This molecule is the most complex that is known; it always\r\ncontains five and often six or even seven elements. The task of thoroughly\r\nunderstanding its composition is necessarily vast, and advance slow. But,\r\nlittle by little, the puzzle is being solved, and this final conquest of\r\norganic chemistry, when it does arrive, will furnish physiologists with new\r\nlight on many of the dark places of physiological science.'[13]\r\n\r\nWhat makes protoplasm and its modifications still more marvellous is the\r\npower it possesses of absorbing and moulding a number of other elements in\r\nvarious parts of living organisms for special uses. Such are silica in the\r\nstems of the grass family, lime and magnesia in the bones of animals, iron\r\nin blood, and many others. Besides the four elements constituting\r\nprotoplasm, most animals and plants contain also in some parts of their\r\nstructure sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, silicon, sodium, potassium,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, and iron; while, less frequently, fluorine, iodine,\r\nbromine, lithium, copper, manganese, and aluminium are also found in\r\nspecial organs or structures; and the molecules of all these are carried\r\nby the protoplasmic fluids to the places where they are required and built\r\ninto the living structure, with the same precision and for similar ends as\r\nbrick and stone, iron, slate, wood, and glass are each utilised in their\r\nproper places in any large building.[14] The organism, however, is not\r\nbuilt, but grows. Every organ, every fibre, cell, or tissue is formed from\r\ndiverse materials, which are first decomposed into their elementary\r\nmolecules, transformed by the protoplasm or by special solvents formed from\r\nit, carried to the places where they are needed by the vital fluids, and\r\nthere built up atom by atom or molecule by molecule into the special\r\nstructures of which they are to form a part.\r\n\r\nBut even this marvel of growth and repair of every individual organism is\r\nfar surpassed by the greater marvel of reproduction. Every living thing of\r\nthe higher orders arises from a single microscopic cell, when fertilised,\r\nas it is termed, by the absorption of another microscopic cell derived from\r\na different individual. These cells are often, even under the highest\r\npowers of the microscope, hardly distinguishable from other cells which\r\noccur in all animals and plants and of which their structure is built up;\r\nyet these special cells begin to grow in a totally different manner, and\r\ninstead of forming one particular part of the organism, develop inevitably\r\ninto a complete living thing with all the organs, powers, and peculiarities\r\nof its parents, so as to be recognisably of the same species. If the\r\nsimple growth of the fully formed organism is a mystery, what of this\r\ngrowth of thousands of complex organisms each with all its special\r\npeculiarities, yet all arising from minute germs or cells the diverse\r\nnatures of which are wholly indistinguishable by the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope? This, too, is said to be the work of protoplasm under the\r\ninfluence of heat and moisture, and modern physiologists hope some day to\r\nlearn 'how it is done.' It may be well here to give the views of a modern\r\nwriter on this point. Referring to a difficulty which had been stated by\r\nClerk-Maxwell twenty-five years ago, that there was not room in the\r\nreproductive cell for the millions of molecules needed to serve as the\r\nunits of growth for all the different structures in the body of the higher\r\nanimals, Professor M'Kendrick says:--'But to-day, it is reasonable from\r\nexisting data to suppose that the germinal vesicle might contain a million\r\nof millions of organic molecules. Complex arrangements of these molecules\r\nsuited for the development of all the parts of a highly complicated\r\norganism, might satisfy all the demands of the theory of heredity.\r\nDoubtless the germ was a material system through and through. The\r\nconception of the physicist was, that molecules were in various states of\r\nmovement; and the thinkers were striving toward a kinetic theory of\r\nmolecules and of atoms of solid matter, which might be as fruitful as the\r\nkinetic theory of gases. There were motions atomic and molecular. It was\r\nconceivable that the peculiarities of vital action might be determined by\r\nthe kind of motion that took place in the molecules of what we call living\r\nmatter. It might be different in kind from some of the motions dealt with\r\nby physicists. Life is continually being created from non-living\r\nmaterial--such, at least, is the existing view of growth by the\r\nassimilation of food. The creation of living matter out of non-living may\r\nbe the transmission to the dead matter of molecular motions which are _sui\r\ngeneris_ in form.' This is the modern physiological view of 'how it may be\r\ndone,' and it seems hardly more intelligible than the very old theory of\r\nthe origin of stone axes, given by Adrianus Tollius in 1649, and quoted by\r\nMr. E.B. Tylor, who says:--'He gives drawings of some ordinary stone axes\r\nand hammers and tells how naturalists say that they are generated in the\r\nsky by a fulgureous exhalation conglobed in a cloud by the circumfixed\r\nhumour, and are, as it were, baked hard by intense heat, and the weapon\r\nbecomes pointed by the damp mixed with it flying from the dry part, and\r\nleaving the other end denser, but the exhalations press it so hard that it\r\nbreaks through the cloud and makes thunder and lightning. But--he says--if\r\nthis is really the way in which they are generated, it is odd they are not\r\nround, and that they have holes through them. It is hardly to be believed,\r\nhe thinks.'[15] And so, when the physiologists, determined to avoid the\r\nassumption of anything beyond matter and motion in the germ, impute the\r\nwhole development and growth of the elephant or of man from minute cells\r\ninternally alike, by means of 'kinds of motion' and the 'transmission of\r\nmotions which are _sui generis_ in form,' many of us will be inclined to\r\nsay with the old author--'It is hardly to be believed, I think.'\r\n\r\nThis brief statement of the conclusions arrived at by chemists and\r\nphysiologists as to the composition and structure of organised living\r\nthings has been thought advisable, because the non-scientific reader has\r\noften no conception of the incomparable marvel and mystery of the\r\nlife-processes he has always seen going on, silently and almost unnoticed,\r\nin the world around him. And this is still more the case now that\r\ntwo-thirds of our population are crowded into cities where, removed from\r\nall the occupations, the charms, and the interests of country life, they\r\nare driven to seek occupation and excitement in the theatre, the\r\nmusic-hall, or the tavern. How little do these know what they lose by being\r\nthus shut out from all quiet intercourse with nature; its soothing sights\r\nand sounds; its exquisite beauties of form and colour; its endless\r\nmysteries of birth, and life, and death. Most people give scientific men\r\ncredit for much greater knowledge than they possess in these matters; and\r\nmany educated readers will, I feel sure, be surprised to find that even\r\nsuch apparently simple phenomena as the rise of the sap in trees are not\r\nyet completely explained. As to the deeper problems of life, and growth,\r\nand reproduction, though our physiologists have learned an infinite amount\r\nof curious or instructive facts, they can give us no intelligible\r\nexplanation of them.\r\n\r\nThe endless complexities and confusing amount of detail in all treatises on\r\nthe physiology of animals and plants are such, that the average reader is\r\noverwhelmed with the mass of knowledge presented to him, and concludes\r\nthat after such elaborate researches everything must be known, and that the\r\nalmost universal protests against the need of any causes but the\r\nmechanical, physical, and chemical laws and forces are well founded. I\r\nhave, therefore, thought it advisable to present a kind of bird's-eye view\r\nof the subject, and to show, in the words of the greatest living\r\nauthorities on these matters, both how complex are the phenomena and how\r\nfar our teachers are from being able to give us any adequate explanation of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope that the very brief sketch of the subject I have been\r\nable to give will enable my readers to form some faint general conception\r\nof the infinite complexity of life and the various problems connected with\r\nit; and that they will thus be the better enabled to appreciate the extreme\r\ndelicacy of those adjustments, those forces, and those complex conditions\r\nof the environment, that alone render life, and above all the grand\r\nage-long panorama of the development of life, in any way possible. It is to\r\nthese conditions, as they prevail in the world around us, that we will now\r\ndirect our attention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Professor F.J. Allen: _What is Life?_\r\n\r\n[12] Art. 'Vegetable Physiology' in _Chambers's Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\n[13] Address to the British Association, 1902, Section Physiology.\r\n\r\n[14] This enumeration of the elements that enter into the structure of\r\nplants and animals is taken from Professor F.J. Allen's paper already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n[15] _Early History of Mankind_, 2nd ed. p. 227.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL FOR ORGANIC LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physical conditions on the surface of our earth which appear to be\r\nnecessary for the development and maintenance of living organisms may be\r\ndealt with under the following headings:--\r\n\r\n1. Regularity of heat-supply, resulting in a limited range of temperature.\r\n\r\n2. A sufficient amount of solar light and heat.\r\n\r\n3. Water in great abundance, and universally distributed.\r\n\r\n4. An atmosphere of sufficient density, and consisting of the gases which\r\nare essential for vegetable and animal life. These are Oxygen,\r\nCarbonic-acid gas, Aqueous vapour, Nitrogen, and Ammonia. These must all be\r\npresent in suitable proportions.\r\n\r\n5. Alternations of day and night.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL RANGE OF TEMPERATURE REQUIRED FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nVital phenomena for the most part occur between the temperatures of\r\nfreezing water and 104° Fahr., and this is supposed to be due mainly to the\r\nproperties of nitrogen and its compounds, which between these temperatures\r\nonly can maintain those peculiarities which are essential to life--extreme\r\nsensitiveness and lability; facility of change as regards chemical\r\ncombination and energy; and other properties which alone render nutrition,\r\ngrowth, and continual repair possible. A very small increase or decrease of\r\ntemperature beyond these limits, if continued for any considerable time,\r\nwould certainly destroy most existing forms of life, and would not\r\nimprobably render any further development of life impossible except in some\r\nof its lowest forms.\r\n\r\nAs one example of the direct effects of increased temperature, we may\r\nadduce the coagulation of albumen. This substance is one of the proteids,\r\nand plays an important part in the vital phenomena of both plants and\r\nanimals, and its fluidity and power of easy combination and change of form\r\nare lost by any degree of coagulation which takes place at about 160° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance to all the higher organisms of a moderate\r\ntemperature is strikingly shown by the complex and successful arrangements\r\nfor maintaining a uniform degree of heat in the interior of the body. The\r\nnormal blood-heat in a man is 98° Fahr., and this is constantly maintained\r\nwithin one or two degrees though the external temperature may be more than\r\nfifty degrees below the freezing-point. High temperatures upon the earth's\r\nsurface do not range so far from the mean as do the low. In the greater\r\npart of the tropics the air-temperature seldom reaches 96° Fahr., though in\r\narid districts and deserts, which occur chiefly along the margins of the\r\nnorthern and southern tropics, it not unfrequently surpasses 110° Fahr.,\r\nand even occasionally rises to 115° or 120° in Australia and Central India.\r\nYet with suitable food and moderate care the blood-temperature of a healthy\r\nman would not rise or fall more than one or at most two degrees. The great\r\nimportance of this uniformity of temperature in all the vital organs is\r\ndistinctly shown by the fact that when, during fevers, the temperature of\r\nthe patient rises six degrees above the normal amount, his condition is\r\ncritical, while an increase of seven or eight degrees is an almost certain\r\nindication of a fatal result. Even in the vegetable kingdom seeds will not\r\ngerminate under a temperature of four or five degrees above the\r\nfreezing-point.\r\n\r\nNow this extreme sensibility to variations of internal temperature is quite\r\nintelligible when we consider the complexity and instability of protoplasm,\r\nand of all the proteids in the living organism, and how important it is\r\nthat the processes of nutrition and growth, involving constant motion of\r\nfluids and incessant molecular decompositions and recombinations, should be\r\neffected with the greatest regularity. And though a few of the higher\r\nanimals, including man, are so perfectly organised that they can adapt or\r\nprotect themselves so as to be able to live under very extreme conditions\r\nas regards temperature, yet this is not the case with the great majority,\r\nor with the lower types, as evidenced by the almost complete absence of\r\nreptiles from the arctic regions.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that extreme cold and extreme heat are nowhere\r\nperpetual. There is always some diversity of seasons, and there is no land\r\nanimal which passes its whole life where the temperature never rises above\r\nthe freezing point.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY OF SOLAR LIGHT\r\n\r\nWhether the higher animals and man could have been developed upon the earth\r\nwithout solar light, even if all the other essential conditions were\r\npresent, is doubtful. That, however, is not the point I am at present\r\nconsidering, but one that is much more fundamental. Without plant life land\r\nanimals at all events could never have come into existence, because they\r\nhave not the power of making protoplasm out of inorganic matter. The plant\r\nalone can take the carbon out of the small proportion of carbonic acid in\r\nthe atmosphere, and with it, and the other necessary elements, as already\r\ndescribed, build up those wonderful carbon compounds which are the very\r\nfoundation of animal life. But it does this solely by the agency of solar\r\nlight, and even uses a special portion of that light. Not only, therefore,\r\nis a sun needed to give light and heat, but it is quite possible that _any_\r\nsun would not answer the purpose. A sun is required whose light possesses\r\nthose special rays which are effective for this operation, and as we know\r\nthat the stars differ greatly in their spectra, and therefore in the nature\r\nof their light, all might not be able to effect this great transformation,\r\nwhich is one of the very first steps in rendering animal life possible on\r\nour earth, and therefore probably on all earths.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER A FIRST ESSENTIAL OF ORGANIC LIFE\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out the absolute necessity of water, since\r\nit actually constitutes a very large proportion of the material of every\r\nliving organism, and about three-fourths of our own bodies. Water,\r\ntherefore, must be present everywhere, in one form or another, on any globe\r\nwhere life is possible. Neither animal nor plant can exist without it. It\r\nmust also be present in such quantity and so distributed as to be\r\nconstantly available on every part of a globe where life is to be\r\nmaintained; and it is equally necessary that it should have persisted in\r\nequal profusion throughout those enormous geological epochs during which\r\nlife has been developing. We shall see later on how very special are the\r\nconditions that have secured this continuous distribution of water on our\r\nearth, and we shall also learn that this large amount of water, its wide\r\ndistribution, and its arrangement with regard to the land-surface, is an\r\nessential factor in producing that limited range of temperature which, as\r\nwe have seen, is a primary condition for the development and maintenance of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT DENSITY AND COMPOSED OF SUITABLE GASES\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of any planet on which life can be developed must have\r\nseveral qualities which are unconnected with each other, and the\r\ncoincidence of which may be a rare phenomenon in the universe. The first of\r\nthese is a sufficient density, which is required for two purposes--as a\r\nstorer of heat, and in order to supply the oxygen, carbonic acid, and\r\naqueous vapour in sufficient quantities for the requirements of vegetable\r\nand animal life.\r\n\r\nAs a reservoir of heat and a regulator of temperature, a rather dense\r\natmosphere is a first necessity, in co-operation with the large quantity\r\nand wide distribution of water referred to in the last section. The very\r\ndifferent character of our south-west from our north-east winds is a good\r\nillustration of its power of distributing heat and moisture. This it does\r\nowing to the peculiar property it possesses of allowing the sun's rays to\r\npass freely through it to the earth which it warms, but acting like a\r\nblanket in preventing the rapid escape of the non-luminous heat so\r\nproduced. But the heat stored up during the day is given out at night, and\r\nthus secures a uniformity of temperature which would not otherwise exist.\r\nThis effect is strikingly seen at high altitudes, where the temperature\r\nbecomes lower and lower, till at a not very great elevation, even in the\r\ntropics, snow lies on the ground all the year round. This is almost wholly\r\ndue to the rarity of the air, which, on that account, has not so much\r\ncapacity for heat. It also allows the heat it acquires to radiate more\r\nfreely than denser air, so that the nights are much colder. At about 18,000\r\nfeet high our atmosphere is exactly half its density at the sea-level. This\r\nis considerably higher than the usual snow-line, even under the equator,\r\nwhence it follows that if our atmosphere was only half its present density\r\nit would render the earth unsuitable for the higher forms of animal life.\r\nIt is not easy to say exactly what would be the result as regards climate;\r\nbut it seems likely that, except perhaps in limited areas in the tropics,\r\nwhere conditions were very favourable, the whole land-surface would become\r\nburied in snow and ice. This appears inevitable, because evaporation from\r\nthe oceans by direct sun-heat would be more rapid than now; but as the\r\nvapour rose in the rare atmosphere it would rapidly become frozen, and snow\r\nwould fall almost perpetually, although it might not lie permanently on the\r\nground in the equatorial lowlands. It appears certain, therefore, that with\r\nhalf our present bulk of atmosphere life would be hardly possible on the\r\nearth on account of lowered temperature alone. And as there would certainly\r\nbe an added difficulty in the needful supply of oxygen to animals and\r\ncarbonic acid to plants, it seems highly probable that a reduction of\r\ndensity of even one-fourth might be sufficient to render a large portion of\r\nthe globe a snow and ice-clad waste, and the remainder liable to such\r\nextremes of climate that only low forms of life could have arisen and been\r\npermanently maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GASES OF THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nComing now to consider the constituent gases of the atmosphere, there is\r\nreason to believe that they form a mixture as nicely balanced in regard to\r\nanimal and vegetable life as are the density and the temperature. At a\r\nfirst view of the subject we might conclude that oxygen is the one great\r\nessential for animal life, and that all else is of little importance. But\r\nfurther consideration shows us that nitrogen, although merely a diluent of\r\nthe oxygen as regards the respiration of animals, is of the first\r\nimportance to plants, which obtain it from the ammonia formed in the\r\natmosphere and carried down into the soil by the rain. Although there is\r\nonly one part of ammonia to a million of air, yet upon this minute\r\nproportion the very existence of the animal world depends, because neither\r\nanimals nor plants can assimilate the free nitrogen of the air into their\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nAnother fundamentally important gas in the atmosphere is carbonic acid,\r\nwhich forms about four parts in ten thousand parts of air, and, as already\r\nstated, is the source from which plants build up the great bulk of their\r\ntissues, as well as those protoplasms and proteids so absolutely necessary\r\nas food for animals. An important fact to notice here is, that carbonic\r\nacid, so essential to plants, and to animals through plants, is yet a\r\npoison to animals. When present in much more than the normal quantity, as\r\nit often is in cities and in badly ventilated buildings, it becomes highly\r\nprejudicial to health; but this is believed to be partly due to the various\r\ncorporeal emanations and other impurities associated with it. Pure carbonic\r\nacid gas to the amount of even one per cent. in otherwise pure air can, it\r\nis said, be breathed for a time without bad effects, but anything more than\r\nthis proportion will soon produce suffocation. It is probable, therefore,\r\nthat a very much smaller proportion than one per cent., if constantly\r\npresent, would be dangerous to life; though no doubt, if this had always\r\nbeen the proportion, life might have been developed in adaptation to it.\r\nConsidering, however, that this poisonous gas is largely given out by the\r\nhigher animals as a product of respiration, it would evidently be dangerous\r\nto the permanence of life if the quantity forming a constant constituent of\r\nthe atmosphere were much greater than it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUEOUS VAPOUR IN THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nThis water-gas, although it occurs in the atmosphere in largely varying\r\nquantities, is yet, in two distinct ways, essential to organic life. It\r\nprevents the too rapid loss of moisture from the leaves of plants when\r\nexposed to the sun, and it is also absorbed by the upper surface of the\r\nleaf and by the young shoots, which thus obtain both water and minute\r\nquantities of ammonia when the supply by the roots is insufficient. But it\r\nis of even more vital importance in supplying the hydrogen which, when\r\nunited with the nitrogen of the atmosphere by electrical discharges,\r\nproduces the ammonia, which is the main source of all the proteids of the\r\nplant, which proteids are the very foundation of animal life.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief statement of the purposes served by the various gases\r\nforming our atmosphere, we see that they are to some extent antagonistic,\r\nand that any considerable increase of one or the other would lead to\r\nresults that might be injurious either directly or in their ultimate\r\nresults. And as the elements which constitute the bulk of all living matter\r\npossess properties which render them alone suitable for the purpose, we may\r\nconclude that the proportions in which they exist in our atmosphere cannot\r\nbe very widely departed from wherever organic forms are developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERNATION OF DAY AND NIGHT\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to decide positively whether alternations of light\r\nand darkness at short intervals are absolutely essential for the\r\ndevelopment of the various higher forms of life, or whether a world in\r\nwhich light was constant might do as well, yet on the whole it seems\r\nprobable that day and night are really important factors. All nature is\r\nfull of rhythmic movements of infinitely varied kinds, degrees, and\r\ndurations. All the motions and functions of living things are periodic;\r\ngrowth and repair, assimilation and waste, go on alternately. All our\r\norgans are subject to fatigue and require rest. All kinds of stimulus must\r\nbe of short duration or injurious results follow. Hence the advantage of\r\ndarkness, when the stimuli of light and heat are partially removed, and we\r\nwelcome 'tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep'--giving rest to all\r\nthe senses and faculties of body and mind, and endowing us with renewed\r\nvigour for another period of activity and enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nPlants as well as animals are invigorated by this nightly repose; and all\r\nalike benefit by these longer periods of greater and less amounts of work\r\ncaused by summer and winter, dry and wet seasons. It is a suggestive fact,\r\nthat where the influence of heat and light is greatest--within the\r\ntropics--the days and nights are of equal length, giving equal periods of\r\nactivity and rest. But in cold and Arctic regions where, during the short\r\nsummer, light is nearly perpetual, and all the functions of life, in\r\nvegetation especially, go on with extreme rapidity, this is followed by the\r\nlong rest of winter, with its short days and greatly lengthened periods of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this is rather suggestion than proof. It is possible that in\r\na world of perpetual day or in one of perpetual night, life _might_ have\r\nbeen developed. But on the other hand, considering the great variety of\r\nphysical conditions which are seen to be necessary for the development and\r\npreservation of life in its endless varieties, any prejudicial influences,\r\nhowever slight, might turn the scale, and prevent that harmonious and\r\ncontinuous evolution which we know _must_ have occurred.\r\n\r\nSo far I have only considered the question of day and night as regards the\r\npresence or absence of light. But it is probably far more important in its\r\nheat aspect; and here its period becomes of great, perhaps vital,\r\nimportance. With its present duration of twelve hours day and twelve night\r\non the average, there is not time, even between the tropics, for the earth\r\nto become so excessively heated as to be inimical to life; while a\r\nconsiderable portion of the heat, stored up in the soil, the water, and the\r\natmosphere, is given out at night, and thus prevents a too sudden and\r\ninjurious contrast of heat and cold. If the day and night were each very\r\nmuch longer--say 50 or 100 hours--it is quite certain that, during a day of\r\nthat duration, the heat would become so great as to be inimical, perhaps\r\nprohibitive, to most forms of life; while the absence of all sun-heat for\r\nan equally long period would result in a temperature far below the\r\nfreezing point of water. It is doubtful whether any high forms of animal\r\nlife could have arisen under such great and continual contrasts of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to point out the special features which, in our earth,\r\nhave combined to bring about and to maintain the various and complex\r\nconditions we have seen to be essential for life as it exists around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH IN ITS RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first circumstance to be considered in relation to the habitability of\r\na planet is its distance from the sun. We know that the heating power of\r\nthe sun upon our earth is ample for the development of life in an almost\r\ninfinite variety of forms; and we have a large amount of evidence to show\r\nthat, were it not for the equalising power of air and water, distributed as\r\nthey are with us, the heat received from the sun would be sometimes too\r\ngreat and sometimes too little. In some parts of Africa, Australia, and\r\nIndia, the sandy soil becomes so hot that an egg can be cooked by placing\r\nit just below the surface. On the other hand, at an elevation of about\r\n12,000 feet in lat. 40° it freezes every night, and throughout the day in\r\nall places sheltered from the sun. Now, both these temperatures are adverse\r\nto life, and if either of them persisted over a considerable portion of the\r\nearth, the development of life would have been impossible. But the heat\r\nderived from the sun is inversely as the square of the distance, so that at\r\nhalf the distance we should have four times as much heat, and at twice the\r\ndistance only one-fourth of the heat. Even at two-thirds of the distance we\r\nshould receive more than twice as much heat; and, considering the facts as\r\nto the extreme sensitiveness of protoplasm and the coagulation of albumen,\r\nit seems certain that we are situated in what has been termed the temperate\r\nzone of the solar system, and that we could not be removed far from our\r\npresent position without endangering a considerable portion of the life now\r\nexisting upon the earth, and in all probability rendering the actual\r\ndevelopment of life, through all its phases and gradations, impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC\r\n\r\nThe effect of the obliquity of the earth's equator to its path round the\r\nsun, upon which depend our varying seasons and the inequality of day and\r\nnight throughout all the temperate zones, is very generally known. But it\r\nis not usually considered that this obliquity is of any great importance as\r\nregards the suitability of the earth for the development and maintenance of\r\nlife; and it seems to have been passed over as an accident hardly worth\r\nnotice, because almost any other obliquity or none at all would have been\r\nequally advantageous. But if we consider what the direction of the earth's\r\naxis might possibly have been, we shall find that it is really a matter of\r\ngreat importance from our present point of view.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, first, that the earth's axis was, like that of Uranus,\r\nalmost exactly in the plane of its orbit or directed towards the sun. There\r\ncan be little doubt that such a position would have rendered our world\r\nunfitted for the development of life. For the result would be the most\r\ntremendous contrasts of the seasons; at mid-winter, on one half the globe,\r\narctic night and more than arctic cold would prevail; while on the other\r\nhalf there would be a midsummer of continuous day with a vertical sun and\r\nsuch an amount of heat as nowhere exists with us. At the two equinoxes the\r\nwhole globe would enjoy equal day and night, all our present tropics and\r\npart of the sub-tropical zone having the sun at noon so near to the zenith\r\nas to have the essential of a tropical climate. But the change to about a\r\nmonth of constant sunshine or a month of continuous night would be so\r\nrapid, that it seems almost impossible that either vegetable or animal life\r\nwould ever have developed under such terrible conditions.\r\n\r\nThe other extreme direction of the earth's axis, exactly at right angles to\r\nthe plane of the orbit, would be much more favourable, but would still have\r\nits disadvantages. The whole surface from equator to poles would enjoy\r\nequal day and night, and every part would receive the same amount of\r\nsun-heat all the year round, so that there would be no change of seasons;\r\nbut the heat received would vary with the latitude. In our latitude the\r\nsun's altitude at noon all the year would be less than 40°, the same as now\r\noccurs at the equinoxes, and we might therefore have a perpetual spring as\r\nregards temperature. But the constancy of the heat in the equatorial and\r\ntropical regions and of cold towards the poles would lead to a more\r\nconstant and more rapid circulation of air, and we should probably\r\nexperience such continuous north-westerly winds as to render our climate\r\nalways cold and probably very damp. Near the poles the sun would always be\r\non, or close to, the horizon, and would give so little heat that the sea\r\nmight be perpetually frozen and the land deeply snow-buried; and these\r\nconditions would probably extend into the temperate zone, and possibly so\r\nfar south as to render life impossible in our latitudes, since whatever\r\nresults arose would be due to permanent causes, and we know how powerful\r\nare snow and ice to extend their sway over adjacent areas if not\r\ncounteracted by summer heat or warm moist winds. On the whole, therefore,\r\nit seems probable that this position of the earth's axis would result in a\r\nmuch smaller portion of its surface being capable of supporting a luxuriant\r\nand varied vegetable and animal life than is now the case; while the\r\nextreme uniformity of conditions everywhere present might be so\r\nantagonistic to the great law of rhythm that seems to pervade the universe,\r\nand be in other ways so unfavourable, that life-development would probably\r\nhave taken quite a different course from that which it has taken.\r\n\r\nIt appears almost certain, therefore, that some intermediate position of\r\nthe axis would be the most favourable; and that which actually exists seems\r\nto combine the advantage of change of seasons with good climatical\r\nconditions over the largest possible area. We know that during the greater\r\npart of the epoch of life-development this area was much greater than at\r\npresent, since a luxuriant vegetation of deciduous and evergreen trees and\r\nshrubs extended up to and within the Arctic Circle, leading to the\r\nformation of coal-beds both in palæozoic and tertiary times; the extremely\r\nfavourable conditions for organic life which then prevailed over so large a\r\nportion of the globe's surface, and which persisted down to a\r\ncomparatively recent epoch, lead to the conclusion that no more favourable\r\ndegree of obliquity was possible than that which we actually possess. A\r\nshort account of the evidence on this interesting subject will now be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSISTENCE OF MILD CLIMATES THROUGH GEOLOGIC TIME\r\n\r\nThe whole of the geological evidence goes to show that in remote ages the\r\nclimate of the earth was generally more uniform, though perhaps not warmer,\r\nthan it is now, and this can be best explained by a slightly different\r\ndistribution of sea and land, which allowed the warm waters of the tropical\r\noceans to penetrate into various parts of the continents (which were then\r\nmore broken up than they are now), and also to extend more freely into the\r\nArctic regions. So soon as we go back into the tertiary period, we find\r\nindications of a warmer climate in the north temperate zone; and when we\r\nreach the middle of that period, we find abundant indications, both in\r\nplant and animal remains, of mild climates near to the Arctic Circle, or\r\nactually within it.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of Greenland, in 70° N. lat., there are found abundance\r\nof fossil plants very beautifully preserved, among which are many different\r\nspecies of oaks, beeches, poplars, plane-trees, vines, walnuts, plums,\r\nchestnuts, sequoias, and numerous shrubs--137 species in all, indicating a\r\nvegetation such as now grows in the north temperate parts of America and\r\nEastern Asia. And even further north, in Spitzbergen, in N. lat. 78° and\r\n79°, a somewhat similar flora is found, not quite so varied, but with oaks,\r\npoplars, birches, planes, limes, hazels, pines, and many aquatic plants\r\nsuch as may now be found in West Norway and in Alaska, nearly twenty\r\ndegrees further south.\r\n\r\nStill more remote, in the Cretaceous period, fossil plants have been found\r\nin Greenland, consisting of ferns, cycads, conifers, and such trees and\r\nshrubs as poplars, sassafras, andromedas, magnolias, myrtles, and many\r\nothers, similar in character and often identical in species with fossils of\r\nthe same period found in Central Europe and the United States, indicating a\r\nwidespread uniformity of climate, such as would be brought about by the\r\ngreat ocean-currents carrying the warm waters of the tropics into the\r\nArctic seas.\r\n\r\nStill further back, in the Jurassic period, we have proofs of a mild\r\nclimate in East Siberia and at Andö in Norway just within the Arctic\r\nCircle, in numerous plant remains, and also remains of great reptiles\r\nallied to those found in the same strata in all parts of the world. Similar\r\nphenomena occur in the still earlier Triassic period; but we will pass on\r\nto the much more remote Carboniferous period, during which most of the\r\ngreat coal-beds of the world were formed from a luxuriant vegetation,\r\nconsisting mostly of ferns, giant horse-tails, and primitive conifers. The\r\nluxuriance of these plants, which are often found beautifully preserved and\r\nin immense quantities, is supposed to indicate an atmosphere in which\r\ncarbonic acid gas was much more abundant than now; and this is rendered\r\nprobable by the small number and low type of terrestrial animals,\r\nconsisting of a few insects and amphibia.\r\n\r\nBut the interesting point is, that true coal-beds, with similar fossils to\r\nthose of our own coal-measures, are found at Spitzbergen and at Bear Island\r\nin East Siberia, both far within the Arctic Circle, again indicating a\r\ngreat uniformity of climate, and probably a denser and more vapour-laden\r\natmosphere, which would act as a blanket over the earth and preserve the\r\nheat brought to the Arctic seas by the ocean currents from the warmer\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe still earlier Silurian rocks are also found abundantly in the Arctic\r\nregions, but their fossils are entirely of marine animals. Yet they show\r\nthe same phenomena as regards climate, since the corals and cephalopodous\r\nmollusca found in the Arctic beds closely resemble those of all other parts\r\nof the earth.[16]\r\n\r\nMany other facts indicate that throughout the enormous periods required for\r\nthe development of the varied forms of life upon the earth, the great\r\nphenomena of nature were but little different from those that prevail in\r\nour own times. The slow and gentle processes by which the various vegetable\r\nand animal remains were preserved are shown by the perfect state in which\r\nmany of the fossils exist. Often trunks of trees, cycads, and tree-ferns\r\nare found standing erect, with their roots still imbedded in the soil they\r\ngrew in. Large leaves of poplars, maples, oaks, and other trees are often\r\npreserved in as perfect a state as if gathered by a botanist and dried\r\nbetween paper for his herbarium, and the same is especially the case with\r\nthe beautiful ferns of the Permian and Carboniferous periods. Throughout\r\nthese and most other formations well-preserved ripple-marks are found in\r\nthe solidified mud or sand of old seashores, differing in no respect from\r\nsimilar marks to be found on almost every coast to-day. Equally interesting\r\nare the marks of rain-drops preserved in the rocks of almost all ages. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell has given illustrations of recent impressions of rain-drops\r\non the extensive mud-flats of Nova Scotia, and also an illustration of\r\nrain-drops on a slab of shale from the carboniferous formation of the same\r\ncountry; and the two are as much alike as the prints of two different\r\nshowers a few days apart. The general size and form of the drops are almost\r\nidentical, and imply a great similarity in the general atmospheric\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that this presence of rain throughout geological time\r\nimplies, as we have seen in our last chapter, a constant and universal\r\ndistribution of atmospheric dust. The two chief sources of this dust--the\r\ntotal quantity of which in the atmosphere must be enormous--are volcanoes\r\nand deserts, and we are therefore sure that these two great natural\r\nphenomena have always been present. Of volcanoes we have ample independent\r\nevidence in the presence of lavas and volcanic ashes, as well as actual\r\nstumps or cores of old volcanoes, through all geological formations; and we\r\ncan have little doubt that deserts also were present, though perhaps not\r\nalways so extensive as they are now. It is a very suggestive fact that\r\nthese two phenomena, usually held to be blots on the fair face of nature,\r\nand even to be opposed to belief in a beneficent Creator, should now be\r\nproved to be really essential to the earth's habitability.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this prevalence of warm and uniform conditions, there is\r\nalso evidence of considerable changes of climate; and at two periods--in\r\nthe Eocene and in the remote Permian--there are even indications of\r\nice-action, so that some geologists believe that there were then actual\r\nglacial epochs. But it seems more probable that they imply only local\r\nglaciation, owing to there having been high land and other suitable\r\nconditions for the production of glaciers in certain areas.\r\n\r\nThe whole bearing of the geological evidence indicates the wonderful\r\ncontinuity of conditions favourable for life, and for the most part of\r\nclimatal conditions more favourable than those now prevailing, since a\r\nlarger extent of land towards the North Pole was available for an abundant\r\nvegetation, and in all probability for an equally abundant animal life. We\r\nknow, too, that there was never any total break in life-development; no\r\nepoch of such lowering or raising of temperature as to destroy all life; no\r\nsuch general subsidence as to submerge the whole land-surface. Although the\r\ngeological record is in parts very imperfect, yet it is, on the whole,\r\nwonderfully complete; and it presents to our view a continuous progress,\r\nfrom simple to complex, from lower to higher. Type after type becomes\r\nhighly specialised in adaptation to local or climatal conditions, and then\r\ndies out, giving room for some other type to arise and be specialised in\r\nharmony with the changed conditions. The general character of the inorganic\r\nchange appears to have been from more insular to more continental\r\nconditions, accompanied by a change from more uniform to less uniform\r\nclimates, from an almost sub-tropical warmth and moisture, extending up to\r\nthe Arctic Circle, to that diversity of tropical, temperate, and cold\r\nareas, capable of supporting the greatest possible variety in the forms of\r\nlife, and which seems especially adapted to stimulate mankind to\r\ncivilisation and social development by means of the necessary struggle\r\nagainst, and utilisation of, the various forces of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER, ITS AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION ON THE EARTH\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally known that the oceans occupy more than two-thirds\r\nof the whole surface of the globe, the enormous bulk of the water in\r\nproportion to the land that rises above its surface is hardly ever\r\nappreciated. But as this is a matter of the greatest importance, both as\r\nregards the geological history of the globe and the special subject we are\r\nhere discussing, it will be necessary to enter into some details in regard\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the best recent estimates, the land area of the globe is 0.28\r\nof the whole surface, and the water area 0.72. But the mean height of the\r\nland above the sea-level is found to be 2250 feet, while the mean depth of\r\nthe seas and oceans is 13,860 feet; so that though the water area is two\r\nand a half times that of the land, the mean depth of the water is more\r\nthan six times the mean height of the land. This is, of course, due to the\r\nfact that lowlands occupy most of the land-area, the plateaus and high\r\nmountains a comparatively small portion of it; while, though the greatest\r\ndepths of the oceans about equal the greatest heights of the mountains, yet\r\nover enormous areas the oceans are deep enough to submerge all the\r\nmountains of Europe and temperate North America, except the extreme summits\r\nof one or two of them. Hence it follows that the bulk of the oceans, even\r\nomitting all the shallow seas, is more than thirteen times that of the land\r\nabove sea-level; and if all the land-surface and ocean-floors were reduced\r\nto one level, that is, if the solid mass of the globe were a true oblate\r\nspheroid, the whole would be covered with water about two miles deep. The\r\ndiagram here given will render this more intelligible and will serve to\r\nillustrate what follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram of proportionate mean height of Land and depth of\r\nOceans_. _Land_ _Area. .28 of area of Globe._ _Ocean_ _Area .72 of area of\r\nGlobe._]\r\n\r\nIn this diagram the lengths of the sections representing land and ocean are\r\nproportionate to their areas, while the thickness of each is proportionate\r\nto their mean height and mean depth respectively. Hence the two sections\r\nare in correct proportion to their cubic contents.\r\n\r\nA mere inspection of this diagram is sufficient to disprove the old idea,\r\nstill held by a few geologists and by many biologists, that oceans and\r\ncontinents have repeatedly changed places during geological times, or that\r\nthe great oceans have again and again been bridged over to facilitate the\r\ndistribution of beetles or birds, reptiles or mammals. We must remember\r\nthat although the diagram shows the continents and oceans as a whole, yet\r\nit also shows, with quite sufficient accuracy, the proportions of each of\r\nthe great continents to the oceans which are adjacent to them. It must also\r\nbe borne in mind that there can be no elevation on a large scale without a\r\ncorresponding subsidence elsewhere; because if there were not a vast\r\nunsupported hollow would be left beneath the rising land or in some part\r\nadjacent to it.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at the diagram and at a chart or globe, try to imagine the\r\nocean-bottom rising gradually, to form a continent joining Africa with\r\nSouth America or with Australia (both of which are demanded by many\r\nbiologists): it is clear that, while such an elevation was going on, either\r\nsome continental land or some other part of the ocean-bed must sink to a\r\ncorresponding amount. We shall then see, that if such changes of elevation\r\non a continental scale have taken place again and again at different\r\nperiods, it would have been almost impossible, on every occasion, to avoid\r\na whole continent being submerged (or even all the continents) in order to\r\nequalise subsidence with elevation while new continents were being raised\r\nup from the abyssal depths of the ocean. We conclude, therefore, that with\r\nthe exception of a comparatively narrow belt around the continents, which\r\nmay be roughly indicated by the thousand fathom line of soundings, the\r\ngreat ocean depths are permanent features of the earth's surface. It is\r\nthis stability of the general distribution of land and water that has\r\nsecured the continuity of life upon the earth. Had the great oceanic\r\nbasins, on the other hand, been unstable, changing places with the land at\r\nvarious periods of geological time, they would, almost certainly, again and\r\nagain have swallowed up the land in their vast abysses, and have thus\r\ndestroyed all the organic life of the world.\r\n\r\nThere are many confirmatory proofs of this view (which is now widely\r\naccepted by geologists and physicists), and a few of them may be briefly\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n1. None of the continents present us with marine deposits of any one\r\ngeological age and occupying a large part of the surface of each, as must\r\nhave been the case had they ever been sunk deep beneath the ocean and again\r\nelevated; neither do any of them contain extensive formations corresponding\r\nto the deep oceanic clays and oozes, which again they must have done had\r\nthey been at any time raised up from the ocean depths.\r\n\r\n2. All the continents present an almost complete and continuous series of\r\nrocks of _all_ geological ages, and in each of the great geological periods\r\nthere are found fresh water and estuarine deposits, and even old\r\nland-surfaces, demonstrating continuity of continental or insular\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n3. All the great oceans possess, scattered over them, a few or many islands\r\ntermed 'oceanic,' and characterised by a volcanic or coralline structure,\r\nwith no ancient stratified rocks in anyone of them; and in none of these\r\nis there found a single indigenous land mammal or amphibian. It is\r\nincredible that, if these oceans had ever contained extensive continents,\r\nand if these oceanic islands are--as even now they are often alleged to\r\nbe--parts of these now submerged continents, not one fragment of any of the\r\nold stratified rocks, which characterise all existing continents, should\r\nremain to show their origin. In the Atlantic we find the Azores, Madeira,\r\nand St. Helena; in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius, Bourbon, and Kerguelen\r\nIsland; in the Pacific, the Fiji, Samoan, Society, Sandwich, and Galapagos\r\nIslands, all without exception telling us the same tale, that they have\r\nbeen built up from the ocean depths by submarine volcanoes and coralline\r\ngrowths, but have never formed part of continental areas.\r\n\r\n4. The contours of the floors of all the great oceans, now fairly well\r\nknown through the soundings of exploring vessels and for submarine\r\ntelegraph lines, also give confirmatory evidence that they have never been\r\ncontinental land. For if any part of them were a sunken continent, that\r\npart must have retained some impress of its origin. Some of the numerous\r\nmountain ranges which characterise _every_ continent would have remained.\r\nWe should find slopes of from 20° to 50° not uncommon, while valleys\r\nbordered by rocky precipices, as in Lake Lucerne and a hundred others, or\r\nisolated rock-walled mountains like Roraima, or ranges of precipices as in\r\nthe Ghâts of India or the Fiords of Norway, would frequently be met with.\r\nBut not a single feature of this kind has ever been found in the ocean\r\nabysses. Instead of these we have vast plains, which, if the water were\r\nremoved, would appear almost exactly level, with no abrupt slopes\r\nanywhere. When we consider that deposits from the land never reach these\r\nremote ocean depths, and that there is no wave-action below a few hundred\r\nfeet, these continental features once submerged would be indestructible;\r\nand their total absence is, therefore, itself a demonstration that none of\r\nthe great oceans are on the sites of submerged continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW OCEAN DEPTHS WERE PRODUCED\r\n\r\nIt is a very difficult problem to determine how the vast basins which are\r\nfilled by the great oceans, especially that of the Pacific, were first\r\nproduced. When the earth's surface was still in a molten state, it would\r\nnecessarily take the form of a true oblate spheroid, with a compression at\r\nthe poles due to its speed of rotation, which is supposed to have been very\r\ngreat. The crust formed by the gradual cooling of such a globe would be of\r\nthe same general form, and, being thin, would easily be fractured or bent\r\nso as to accommodate itself to any unequal stresses from the interior. As\r\nthe crust thickened and the whole mass slowly cooled and contracted,\r\nfissures and crumpling would occur, the former serving as outlets for\r\nvolcanic activities whose results are found throughout all geological ages;\r\nthe latter producing mountain chains in which the rocks are almost always\r\ncurved, folded, or even thrust over each other, indicating the mighty\r\nforces due to the adjustments of a solid crust upon a shrinking fluid or\r\nsemi-fluid interior.\r\n\r\nBut during this whole process there seem to be no forces at work that could\r\nlead to the production of such a feature as the Pacific, a vast depression\r\ncovering nearly one-third of the whole surface of the globe. The Atlantic\r\nOcean, being smaller and nearly opposite to the Pacific, but approximately\r\nof equal depth, may be looked upon as a complementary phenomenon which will\r\nbe probably explained as a result of the same causes as the vaster cavity.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, there is only one suggested cause of the formation of\r\nthese great oceans that seems adequate; and as that cause is to some extent\r\nsupported by quite independent astronomical evidence, and also directly\r\nbears upon the main subject of the present volume, it must be briefly\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Professor George Darwin, of Cambridge, arrived at a\r\ncertain conclusion as to the origin of the moon, which is now comparatively\r\nwell known by Sir Robert Ball's popular account of it in his small volume,\r\n_Time and Tide_. Briefly stated, it is as follows. The tides produce\r\nfriction on the earth and very slowly increase the length of our day, and\r\nalso cause the moon to recede further from us. The day is lengthened only\r\nby a small fraction of a second in a thousand years, and the moon is\r\nreceding at an equally imperceptible rate. But as these forces are\r\nconstant, and have always acted on the earth and moon, as we go back and\r\nback into the almost infinite past we come to a time when the rotation of\r\nthe earth was so rapid that gravity at the equator could hardly retain its\r\nouter portion, which was spread out so that the form of the whole mass was\r\nsomething like a cheese with rounded edges. And about the same epoch the\r\ndistance of the moon is found to have been so small that it was actually\r\ntouching the earth. All this is the result of mathematical calculation from\r\nthe known laws of gravitation and tidal effects; and as it is difficult to\r\nsee how so large a body as the moon could have originated in any other way,\r\nit is supposed that at a still earlier period the moon and earth were one,\r\nand that the moon separated from the parent mass owing to centrifugal force\r\ngenerated by the earth's rapid rotation. Whether the earth was liquid or\r\nsolid at this epoch, and exactly how the separation occurred, is not\r\nexplained either by Professor Darwin or Sir Robert Ball; but it is a very\r\nsuggestive fact that, quite recently, it has been shown, by means of the\r\nspectroscope, that double stars of short period _do_ originate in this way\r\nfrom a single star, as already described in our sixth chapter; but in these\r\ncases it seems probable that the parent star is in a gaseous state.\r\n\r\nThese investigations of Professor G. Darwin have been made use of by the\r\nRev. Osmond Fisher (in his very interesting and important work, _Physics of\r\nthe Earth's Crust_) to account for the basins of the great oceans, the\r\nPacific being the chasm left when the larger portion of the mass of the\r\nmoon parted from the earth.\r\n\r\nAdopting, as I do, the theory of the origin of the earth by meteoric\r\naccretion of solid matter, we must consider our planet as having been\r\nproduced from one of those vast rings of meteorites which in great numbers\r\nstill circulate round the sun, but which at the much earlier period now\r\ncontemplated were both more numerous and much more extensive. Owing to\r\nirregularities of distribution in such a ring and through disturbance by\r\nother bodies, aggregations of various size would inevitably occur, and the\r\nlargest of these would in time draw in to itself all the rest, and thus\r\nform a planet. During the early stages of this process the particles would\r\nbe so small and would come together so gradually, that little heat would be\r\nproduced, and there would result merely a loose aggregation of cold matter.\r\nBut as the process went on and the mass of the incipient planet became\r\nconsiderable--perhaps half that of the earth--the rest of the ring would\r\nfall in with greater and greater velocity; and this, added to the\r\ngravitative compression of the growing mass might, when nearly its present\r\nsize, have produced sufficient heat to liquefy the outer layers, while the\r\ncentral portion remained solid and to some extent incoherent, with probably\r\nlarge quantities of heavy gases in the interstices. When the amount of the\r\nmeteoric accretions became so reduced as to be insufficient to keep up the\r\nheat to the melting-point, a crust would form, and might have reached about\r\nhalf or three-fourths of its present thickness when the moon became\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nLet us now try to picture to ourselves what happened. We should have a\r\nglobe somewhat larger than our earth is now, both because it then contained\r\nthe material of the moon and also because it was hotter, revolving so\r\nrapidly as to be very greatly flattened at the poles; while the equatorial\r\nbelt bulged out enormously, and would probably have separated in the form\r\nof a ring with a very slight increase of the time of rotation, which is\r\nsupposed to have been about four hours. This globe would have a\r\ncomparatively thin crust, beneath which there was molten rock to an\r\nunknown depth, perhaps a few hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand miles.\r\nAt this time the attraction of the sun acting on the molten interior\r\nproduced tides in it, causing the thin crust to rise and fall every two\r\nhours, but to so small an extent--only about a foot or so--as not\r\nnecessarily to fracture it; but it is calculated that this slight rhythmic\r\nundulation coincided with the normal period of undulation due to such a\r\nlarge mass of heavy liquid, and so tended to increase the instability due\r\nto rapid rotation.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the moon is about one-fiftieth part that of the earth, and an\r\neasy calculation shows us that, taking the area of the Pacific, Atlantic,\r\nand Indian Oceans combined as about two-thirds that of the globe, it would\r\nrequire a thickness (or depth) of about forty miles to furnish the material\r\nfor the moon. We must, of course, assume that there were some inequalities\r\nin the thickness of the crust and in its comparative rigidity, so that when\r\nthe critical moment came and the earth could no longer retain its\r\nequatorial protuberance against the centrifugal force due to rotation\r\ncombined with the tidal undulations caused by the sun, instead of a\r\ncontinuous ring slowly detaching itself, the crust gave way in two or more\r\ngreat masses where it was weakest, and as the tidal wave passed under it\r\nand a quantity of the liquid substratum rose with it, the whole would break\r\nup and collect into a sub-globular mass a short distance from the earth,\r\nand continue revolving with it for some time at about the same rate as the\r\nsurface had rotated. But as tidal action is always equal on opposite sides\r\nof a globe, there would be a similar disruption there, forming, it may be\r\nsupposed, the Atlantic basin, which, as may be seen on a small globe, is\r\nalmost exactly opposite a part of the Central Pacific. So soon as these two\r\ngreat masses had separated from the earth, the latter would gradually\r\nsettle down into a state of equilibrium, and the molten matter of the\r\ninterior, which would now fill the great oceanic basins up to a level of a\r\nfew mile below the general surface would soon cool enough to form a thin\r\ncrust. The larger portion of the nascent moon would gradually attract to\r\nitself the one or more smaller portions and form our satellite; and from\r\nthat time tidal friction by both moon and sun would begin to operate and\r\nwould gradually lengthen our day and, more rapidly, our month in the way\r\nexplained in Sir Robert Ball's volume.\r\n\r\nA very interesting point may now be referred to, because it seems\r\nconfirmatory of this origin of the great ocean basins. In Mr. Osmond\r\nFisher's work it is explained how the variations in the force of gravity,\r\nat numerous points all over the world, have been determined by observations\r\nwith the pendulum, and also how these variations afford a measure of the\r\nthickness of the solid crust, which is of less specific gravity than the\r\nmolten interior on which it rests. By this means a very interesting result\r\nwas obtained. The observations on numerous oceanic islands proved that the\r\nsub-oceanic crust was considerably more dense than the crust under the\r\ncontinents, but also thinner, the result being to bring the average mass of\r\nthe sub-oceanic crust and oceans to an equality with that of the\r\ncontinental crust, and this causes the whirling earth to be in a state of\r\nbalance, or equilibrium. Now, both the thinness and the increased density\r\nof the crust seem to be well explained by this theory of the origin of the\r\noceanic basins. The new crust would necessarily for a long time be thinner\r\nthan the older portion, because formed so much later, but it would very\r\nsoon become cool enough to allow the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere and\r\nthat given off through fissures from the molten interior to collect in the\r\nocean basins, which would thenceforth be cooled more rapidly and kept at a\r\nuniform temperature and also under a uniform pressure, and these conditions\r\nwould lead to the steady and continuous increase of thickness, with a\r\ngreater compactness of structure than in the continental areas. It is no\r\ndoubt to this uniformity of conditions, with a lowering of the bottom\r\ntemperature throughout the greater part of geological time, till it has\r\nbecome only a few degrees above the freezing-point, that we owe the\r\nremarkable persistence of the vast and deep ocean basins on which, as we\r\nhave seen, the continuity of life on the earth has largely depended.\r\n\r\nThere is one other fact which lends some support to this theory of the\r\norigin of the ocean basins--their almost complete symmetry with regard to\r\nthe equator. Both the Atlantic and Pacific basins extend to an equal\r\ndistance north and south of the equator, an equality which could hardly\r\nhave been produced by any cause not directly connected with the earth's\r\nrotation. The polar seas which are coterminous with the two great oceans\r\nare very much shallower, and cannot, therefore, be considered as forming\r\npart of the true oceanic basins.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER AS AN EQUALISER OF TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\nThe importance of water in regulating the temperature of the earth is so\r\ngreat that, even if we had enough water on the land for all the wants of\r\nplants and animals, but had no great oceans, it is almost certain that the\r\nearth could not have produced and sustained the various forms of life which\r\nit now possesses.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the oceans is twofold. Owing to the great specific heat of\r\nwater, that is, its property of absorbing heat slowly but to a large\r\namount, and giving it out with equal slowness, the surface-waters of the\r\noceans and seas are heated by the sun so that by the evening of a bright\r\nday they have become quite warm to a depth of several feet. But air has\r\nmuch less specific heat than water, a pound of water in cooling one degree\r\nbeing capable of warming four pounds of air one degree; but as air is 770\r\ntimes as light as water, it follows that the heat from one cubic foot of\r\nwater will warm more than 3000 cubic feet of air as much as it cools\r\nitself. Hence the enormous surface of the seas and oceans, the larger part\r\nof which is within the tropics, warms the whole of the lower and denser\r\nportions of the air, especially during the night, and this warmth is\r\ncarried to all parts of the earth by the winds, and thus ameliorates the\r\nclimate. Another quite distinct effect is due to the great ocean currents,\r\nlike the Gulf Stream and the Japan Current, which carry the warm water of\r\nthe tropics to temperate and arctic regions, and thus render many countries\r\nhabitable which would otherwise suffer the rigour of an almost arctic\r\nwinter. These currents are, however, directly due to the winds, and\r\nproperly belong to the section on the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe other equalising action, due primarily to the great area of the seas\r\nand oceans, is a result of the vast evaporating surface from which the land\r\nderives almost all its water in the form of rain and rivers; and it is\r\nquite evident that if there were not sufficient water-surface to produce an\r\nample supply of vapour for this purpose, arid districts would occupy more\r\nand more of the earth's surface. How much water-surface is necessary for\r\nlife we do not know; but if the proportions of water and land-surfaces were\r\nreversed, it seems probable that the larger proportion of the earth might\r\nbe uninhabitable. The vapour thus produced has also a very great effect in\r\nequalising temperature; but this also is a point which will come better\r\nunder our next chapter on the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some matters connected with the water-supply of the\r\nearth, and its relation to the development of life, that call for a few\r\nremarks here. What has determined the total quantity of water on the earth\r\nor on other planets does not appear to be known; but presumably it would\r\ndepend, partially or wholly, on the mass of the planet being sufficient to\r\nenable it to retain by its gravitative force the oxygen and hydrogen of\r\nwhich water is composed. As the two gases are so easily combined to form\r\nwater, but can only be separated under special conditions, its quantity\r\nwould be dependent on the supply of hydrogen, which is but rarely found on\r\nthe earth in a free state. The important fact, however, is, that we do\r\npossess so great a quantity of water, that if the whole surface of the\r\nglobe was as regularly contoured as are the continents, and merely wrinkled\r\nwith mountain chains, then the existing water would cover the whole globe\r\nnearly two miles deep, leaving only the tops of high mountains above its\r\nsurface as rows of small islands, with a few larger islands formed by what\r\nare now the high plateaus of Tibet and the Southern Andes.\r\n\r\nNow there seems no reason why this distribution of the water should not\r\nhave occurred--in fact it seems probable that it would have occurred, had\r\nit not been for the fortunate coincidence of the formation of enormously\r\ndeep ocean basins. So far as I am aware, no sufficient explanation of the\r\nformation of these basins has been given but that of Mr. Osmond Fisher, as\r\nhere described, and that depends upon three unique circumstances: (1) the\r\nformation of a satellite at a very late period of the planet's development\r\nwhen there was already a rather thick crust; (2) the satellite being far\r\nlarger in proportion to its primary than any other in the solar system; and\r\n(3) its having been produced by fission from its primary on account of\r\nextremely rapid rotation, combined with solar tides in its molten interior,\r\nand a rate of oscillation of that molten interior coinciding with the tidal\r\nperiod.[17]\r\n\r\nWhether this very remarkable theory of the origin of our moon is the true\r\none, and if so, whether the explanation it seems to afford of the great\r\noceanic basins is correct, I am not mathematician enough to judge. The\r\ntidal theory of the origin of the moon, as worked out mathematically by\r\nProfessor G.H. Darwin, has been supported by Sir Robert Ball and accepted\r\nby many other astronomers; while the researches of the Rev. Osmond Fisher\r\ninto the _Physics of the Earth's Crust_, together with his mathematical\r\nabilities and his practical work as a geologist, entitle his opinion on the\r\nquestion of the mode of origin of the ocean basins to the highest respect.\r\nAnd, as we have seen, the existence of these vast and deep ocean basins,\r\nproduced by the agency of a series of events so remarkable as to be quite\r\nunique in the solar system, played an important part in rendering the earth\r\nfit for the development of the higher forms of animal life, while without\r\nthem it seems not improbable that the conditions would have been such as to\r\nrender any varied forms of terrestrial life hardly possible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] For a fuller account of this Arctic fauna and flora see the works of\r\nSir C. Lyell, Sir A. Geikie, and other geologists. A full summary of it is\r\nalso given in the author's _Island Life_.\r\n\r\n[17] Professor G.H. Darwin states that it is nearly certain that no other\r\nsatellite nor any of the planets originated in the same way as the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH IN RELATION TO LIFE: ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in our tenth chapter that the physical basis of\r\nlife--protoplasm--consists of the four elements, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, and carbon, and that both plants and animals depend largely upon\r\nthe free oxygen in the air to carry on their vital processes; while the\r\ncarbonic acid and ammonia in the atmosphere seem to be absolutely essential\r\nto plants. Whether life could have arisen and have been highly developed\r\nwith an atmosphere composed of different elements from ours it is, of\r\ncourse, impossible to say; but there are certain physical conditions which\r\nseem absolutely essential whatever may be the elements which compose it.\r\n\r\nThe first of these essentials is an atmosphere which shall be of such\r\ndensity at the surface of the planet, and of so great a bulk, as to be not\r\ntoo rare to fulfil its various functions at all altitudes where there is a\r\nconsiderable area of land. What determines the total quantity of gaseous\r\nmatter on the surface of a planet will be, mainly, its mass, together with\r\nthe average temperature of its surface.\r\n\r\nThe molecules of gases are in a state of rapid motion in all directions,\r\nand the lighter gases have the most rapid motions. The average speed of\r\nthe motion of the molecules has been roughly determined under varying\r\nconditions of pressure and temperature, and also the probable maximum and\r\nminimum rates, and from these data, and certain known facts as to planetary\r\natmospheres, Mr. G. Johnstone Stoney, F.R.S., has calculated what gases\r\nwill escape from the atmospheres of the earth and the other planets. He\r\nfinds that all the gases which are constituents of air have such\r\ncomparatively low molecular rates of motion that the force of gravity at\r\nthe upper limits of the earth's atmosphere is amply sufficient to retain\r\nthem; hence the stability in its composition. But there are two other\r\ngases, hydrogen and helium, which are both known to enter the atmosphere,\r\nbut never accumulate so as to form any measurable portion of it, and these\r\nare found to have sufficient molecular motion to escape from it. With\r\nregard to hydrogen, if the earth were much larger and more massive than it\r\nis, so as to retain the hydrogen, disastrous consequences might ensue,\r\nbecause, whenever a sufficient quantity of this gas accumulated, it would\r\nform an explosive mixture with the oxygen of the atmosphere, and a flash of\r\nlightning or even the smallest flame would lead to explosions so violent\r\nand destructive as perhaps to render such a planet unsuited for the\r\ndevelopment of life. We appear, therefore, to be just at the major limit of\r\nmass to secure habitability, except in such planets as may have no\r\ncontinuous supply of free hydrogen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important mechanical functions of the atmosphere dependent\r\non its density are: (1) the production of winds, which in many ways bring\r\nabout an equalisation of temperature, and which also produce\r\nsurface-currents on the ocean; and (2) the distribution of moisture over\r\nthe earth by means of clouds which also have other important functions.\r\n\r\nWinds depend primarily on the local distribution of heat in the air,\r\nespecially on the great amount of heat constantly present in the equatorial\r\nzone, due to the sun being always nearly vertical at noon, and to its being\r\nsimilarly vertical at each tropic once a year, with a longer day, leading\r\nto even higher temperatures than at the equator, and producing also that\r\ncontinuous belt of arid lands or deserts which almost encircle the globe in\r\nthe region of the tropics. Heated air being lighter, the colder air from\r\nthe temperate zones continually flows towards it, lifting it up and causing\r\nit to flow over, as it were, to the north and south. But as the inflow\r\ncomes from an area of less rapid to one of more rapid rotation, the course\r\nof the air is diverted, and produces the north-east and south-east trades;\r\nwhile the overflow from the equator going to an area of less rapid\r\nrotation, turns westward and produces the south-west winds so prevalent\r\nover the north Atlantic and the north temperate zone generally, and the\r\nnorth-west in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt is outside the zone of the equable trade-winds, and in a region a few\r\ndegrees on each side of the tropics, that destructive hurricanes and\r\ntyphoons prevail. These are really enormous whirlwinds due to the intensely\r\nheated atmosphere over the arid regions already mentioned, causing an\r\ninrush of cool air from various directions, thus setting up a rotatory\r\nmotion which increases in rapidity till equilibrium is restored. The\r\nhurricanes of the West Indies and Mauritius, and the typhoons of the\r\nEastern seas, are thus caused. Some of these storms are so violent that no\r\nhuman structures can resist them, while the largest and most vigorous trees\r\nare torn to pieces or overturned by them. But if our atmosphere were much\r\ndenser than it is, its increased weight would give it still greater\r\ndestructive force; and if to this were added a somewhat greater amount of\r\nsun-heat--which might be due either to our greater proximity to the sun or\r\nto the sun's greater size or greater heat-intensity, these tempests might\r\nbe so increased in frequency and violence as to render considerable\r\nportions of the earth uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThe constant and equable trade-winds have a very important function in\r\ninitiating those far-reaching ocean-currents which are of the greatest\r\nimportance in equalising temperature. The well known Gulf Stream is to us\r\nthe most important of these currents, because it plays the chief part in\r\ngiving us the mild climate we enjoy in common with the whole of Western\r\nEurope, a mildness which is felt to a considerable distance within the\r\nArctic Circle; and, in conjunction with the Japan current, which does the\r\nsame for the whole of the temperate regions of the North Pacific, renders a\r\nlarge portion of the globe better adapted for life than it would be without\r\nthese beneficial influences.\r\n\r\nThese equalising currents, however, are almost entirely due to the form and\r\nposition of the continents, and especially to the fact that they are so\r\nsituated as to leave vast expanses of ocean along the equatorial zone, and\r\nextending north and south to the arctic and antarctic regions. If with the\r\nsame amount of land the continents had been so grouped as to occupy a\r\nconsiderable portion of the equatorial oceans--such as would have been the\r\ncase had Africa been turned so as to join South America, and Asia been\r\nbrought to the south-east so as to take the place of part of the equatorial\r\nPacific, then the great ocean-currents could have been but feeble or have\r\nhardly existed. Without these currents much of the north and south\r\ntemperate lands would have been buried in ice, while the largest portion of\r\nthe continents would have been so intensely heated as perhaps to be\r\nunsuited for the development of the higher forms of animal life, since we\r\nhave shown (in chapters X. and XI.) how delicate is the balance and how\r\nnarrow the limits of temperature which are required.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no reason whatever why some such distribution of the sea\r\nand land should not have existed, had it not been for the admittedly\r\nexceptional conditions which led to the production of our satellite, thus\r\nnecessarily forming vast chasms along the region of the equator where\r\ncentrifugal force as well as the internal solar tides were most powerful,\r\nand where the thin crust was thus compelled to give way. And as the highest\r\nauthorities declare that there are no indications of such an origin of\r\nsatellites in the case of any other planet, the whole series of conditions\r\nfavourable to life on the earth become all the more remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS, THEIR IMPORTANCE AND THEIR CAUSES\r\n\r\nFew persons have any adequate conception of the real nature of clouds and\r\nof the important part they take in rendering our world a habitable and an\r\nenjoyable one.\r\n\r\nOn the average, the rainfall over the oceans is much less than over the\r\nland, the whole region of the trade-winds having usually a cloudless sky\r\nand very little rain; but in the intervening belt of calms, near to the\r\nequator, a cloudy sky and heavy rains are frequent. This arises from the\r\nfact that the warm, moist air over the ocean is raised upwards, by the cold\r\nand heavy air from north and south, into a cooler region where it cannot\r\nhold so much aqueous vapour, which is there condensed and falls as rain.\r\nGenerally, wherever the winds blow over extensive areas of water on to the\r\nland, especially if there are mountains or elevated plateaus which cause\r\nthe moisture-laden air to rise to heights where the temperature is lower,\r\nclouds are formed and more or less rain falls. But if the land is of an\r\narid nature and much heated by the sun, the air becomes capable of holding\r\nstill more aqueous vapour, and even dense rain-clouds disperse without\r\nproducing any rainfall. From these simple causes, with the large area of\r\nsea as compared with the land upon our earth, by far the larger portion of\r\nthe surface is well supplied with rain, which, falling most abundantly in\r\nthe elevated and therefore cooler regions, percolates the soil, and gives\r\nrise to those innumerable springs and rivulets which moisten and beautify\r\nthe earth, and which, uniting together, form streams and rivers, which\r\nreturn to the seas and oceans whence they were originally derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS AND RAIN DEPEND UPON ATMOSPHERIC DUST\r\n\r\nThe beautiful system of aqueous circulation by means of the atmosphere as\r\nsketched above was long thought to explain the whole process, and to\r\nrequire no further elucidation; but about a quarter of a century back a\r\ncurious experiment was made which indicated that there was another factor\r\nin the process which had been entirely overlooked. If a small jet of steam\r\nis sent into two large glass receivers, one filled with ordinary air, the\r\nother with air which has been filtered by passing through a thick layer of\r\ncotton wool so as to keep back all particles of solid matter, the first\r\nvessel will be instantly filled with condensed cloudy-looking vapour, while\r\nin the other vessel the air and vapour will remain perfectly transparent\r\nand invisible. Another experiment was then made to imitate more nearly what\r\noccurs in nature. The two vessels were prepared as before, but a small\r\nquantity of water was placed in each vessel and allowed to evaporate till\r\nthe air was nearly saturated with vapour, which remained invisible in both.\r\nBoth vessels were then slightly cooled, when instantly a dense cloud was\r\nformed in that filled with unfiltered air, while the other remained quite\r\nclear. These experiments proved that the mere cooling of air below the dew\r\npoint will not cause the aqueous vapour in it to condense into drops so as\r\nto form mist, fog, or cloud, unless small particles of solid or liquid\r\nmatter are present to act as nuclei upon which condensation begins. The\r\ndensity of a cloud will therefore depend not only on the quantity of vapour\r\nin the air, but on the presence of an abundance of minute dust-particles on\r\nwhich condensation can begin.\r\n\r\nThat such dust exists everywhere in the air, even up to great heights, is\r\nnot a supposition but a proved fact. By exposing glass plates covered with\r\nglycerine in different places and at different altitudes the number of\r\nthese particles in each cubic foot of air has been determined; and it is\r\nfound that not only are they present everywhere at low levels, but that\r\nthere are a considerable number even at the tops of the highest mountains.\r\nThese solid particles also act in another way. By radiation in the higher\r\natmosphere they become very cold, and thus condense the vapour by contact,\r\njust as the points of grass-blades condense it to form dew.\r\n\r\nWhen steam is escaping from an engine we see a mass of dense white vapour,\r\na miniature cloud; and if we are near it in cold, damp weather, we feel\r\nlittle drops of rain produced from it. But on a fine, warm day it rises\r\nquickly and soon melts away, and entirely disappears. Exactly the same\r\nthing happens on a larger scale in nature. In fine weather we may have\r\nabundant clouds continually passing high overhead, but they never produce\r\nrain, because as the minute globules of water slowly fall towards the\r\nearth, the warm dry air again turns them into invisible vapour. Again, in\r\nfine weather, we often see a small cloud on a mountain top which remains\r\nthere a considerable time, even though a brisk wind is blowing. The\r\nmountain top is colder than the surrounding air, and the invisible vapour\r\nbecomes condensed into cloud by passing over it, but the moment these cloud\r\nparticles are carried past the summit into the warmer and drier air they\r\nare again evaporated and disappear. On Table Mountain, near Cape Town, this\r\nphenomenon occurs on a large scale, and is termed the table-cloth, the mass\r\nof white fleecy cloud seeming to hang over the flat mountain top to some\r\ndistance down where it remains for several months, while all around there\r\nis bright sunshine.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon that indicates the universal presence of dust to\r\nenormous heights in the atmosphere is the blue colour of the sky. This is\r\ncaused by the presence of such excessively minute particles of dust through\r\nan enormous thickness of the higher atmosphere--probably up to a height of\r\ntwenty or thirty miles, or more--that they reflect only the light of short\r\nwave-length from the blue end of the spectrum. This also has been proved by\r\nexperiment. If a glass cylinder, several feet long, is filled with pure air\r\nfrom which all solid particles have been removed by filtering and passing\r\nover red-hot platinum wires, and a ray of electric light is passed through\r\nit, the interior, when viewed laterally, appears quite dark, the light\r\npassing through in a straight line and not illuminating the air. But if a\r\nlittle more air is passed through the filter so rapidly as to allow only\r\nthe minutest particles of dust to enter with it, the vessel becomes\r\ngradually filled with a blue haze, which gradually deepens into a beautiful\r\nblue, comparable with that of the sky. If now some of the unfiltered air\r\nis admitted, the blue fades away into the ordinary tint of daylight.\r\n\r\nSince it has been known that liquid oxygen is blue, many people have\r\nconcluded that this explains the blue colour of the sky. But it has really\r\nnothing to do with the point at issue. The blue of the liquid oxygen\r\nbecomes so excessively faint in the gas, further attenuated as it is by the\r\ncolourless nitrogen, that it would have no perceptible colour in the whole\r\nthickness of our atmosphere. Again, if it had a perceptible blue tint we\r\ncould not see it against the blackness of space behind it; but white\r\nobjects seen through it, such as the moon and clouds, should all appear\r\nblue, which they do not do. The blue we see is from the whole sky, and is\r\ntherefore reflected light; and as pure air is quite transparent, there must\r\nbe solid or liquid particles so minute as to reflect blue light only. In\r\nthe lower atmosphere the rain-producing particles are larger, and reflect\r\nall the rays, thus diluting the blue colour near the horizon, and, by\r\nrefraction and reflection combined, producing the various beautiful hues of\r\nsunrise and sunset.\r\n\r\nThis production of exquisite colours by the dust in the atmosphere, though\r\nadding greatly to the enjoyment of life, cannot be considered essential to\r\nit; but there is another circumstance connected with atmospheric dust\r\nwhich, though little appreciated, might have effects which can hardly be\r\ncalculated. If there were no dust in the atmosphere, the sky would appear\r\nblack even at noon, except in the actual direction of the sun; and the\r\nstars would be visible in the day as well as at night. This would follow\r\nbecause air does not reflect light, and is not visible. We should therefore\r\nreceive no light from the sky itself as we do now, and the north side of\r\nevery hill, house, and other solid objects, would be totally dark, unless\r\nthere were any surfaces in that direction to reflect the light. The surface\r\nof the ground at a little distance would be in sunshine, and this would be\r\nthe only source of light wherever direct sunlight was cut off. To get a\r\ngood amount of pleasant light in houses it would be necessary to have them\r\nbuilt on nearly level ground, or on ground rising to the north, and with\r\nwalls of glass all round and down to the floor line, to receive as much as\r\npossible of the reflected light from the ground. What effect this kind of\r\nlight would have on vegetation it is difficult to say, but trees and shrubs\r\nwould probably grow laterally towards the south, east, and west, so as to\r\nget as much direct sunshine as possible.\r\n\r\nA more important result would be that, as sunshine would be perpetual\r\nduring the day, so much evaporation would take place that the soil would\r\nbecome arid and almost bare in places that are now covered with vegetation,\r\nand plants like the cactuses of Arizona and the euphorbias of South Africa\r\nwould occupy a large portion of the surface.\r\n\r\nReturning now from this collateral subject of light and colour to the more\r\nimportant aspect of the question--the absence of cloud and rain--we have to\r\nconsider what would happen, and in what way the enormous quantity of water\r\nwhich would be evaporated under continual sunshine would be returned to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious means would be by abnormally abundant dews,\r\nwhich would be deposited almost every night on every form of leafy\r\nvegetation. Not only would all grass and herbage, but all the outer leaves\r\nof shrubs and trees, condense so much moisture as to take the place of rain\r\nso far as the needs of such vegetation were concerned. But without\r\narrangements for irrigation cultivation would be almost impossible, because\r\nthe bare soil would become intensely heated during the day, and would\r\nretain so much of its heat through the night so as to prevent any dew\r\nforming upon it.\r\n\r\nSome more effective mode, therefore, of returning the aqueous vapour of the\r\natmosphere to the earth and ocean, would be required, and this, I believe,\r\nwould be done by means of hills and mountains of sufficient height to\r\nbecome decidedly colder than the lowlands. The air from over the oceans\r\nwould be constantly loaded with moisture, and whenever the winds blew on to\r\nthe land the air would be carried up the slopes of the hills into the\r\ncolder regions, and there be rapidly condensed upon the vegetation, and\r\nalso on the bare earth and rocks of northern slopes, and wherever they\r\ncooled sufficiently during the afternoon or night to be below the\r\ntemperature of the air. The quantity of vapour thus condensed would reduce\r\nthe atmospheric pressure, which would lead to an inrush of air from below,\r\nbringing with it more vapour, and this might give rise to perpetual\r\ntorrents, especially on northern and eastern slopes. But as the evaporation\r\nwould be much greater than at the present time, owing to perpetual\r\nsunshine, so the water returned to the earth would be greater, and as it\r\nwould not be so uniformly distributed over the land as it is now, the\r\nresult would perhaps be that extensive mountain sides would become\r\ndevastated by violent torrents, rendering permanent vegetation almost\r\nimpossible; while other and more extensive areas, in the absence of rain,\r\nwould become arid wastes that would support only the few peculiar types of\r\nvegetation that are characteristic of such regions.\r\n\r\nWhether such conditions as here supposed would prevent the development of\r\nthe higher forms of life it is impossible to say, but it is certain that\r\nthey would be very unfavourable, and might have much more disastrous\r\nconsequences than any we have here suggested. We can hardly suppose that,\r\nwith winds and rock-formations at all like what they are now, any world\r\ncould be wholly free from atmospheric dust. If, however, the atmosphere\r\nitself were much less dense than it is, say one-half, which might very\r\neasily have been the case, then the winds would have less carrying power,\r\nand at the elevations at which clouds are usually formed there would not be\r\nenough dust-particles to assist in their formation. Hence fogs close to the\r\nearth's surface would largely take the place of clouds floating far above\r\nit, and these would certainly be less favourable to human life and to that\r\nof many of the higher animals than existing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe world-wide distribution of atmospheric dust is a remarkable phenomenon.\r\nAs the blue colour of the sky is universal, the whole of the higher\r\natmosphere must be pervaded by myriads of ultra-microscopical particles,\r\nwhich, by reflecting the blue rays only, give us not only the azure vault\r\nof heaven, but in combination with the coarser dust of lower altitudes,\r\ndiffused daylight, the grand forms and motions of the fleecy clouds, and\r\nthe 'gentle rain from heaven' to refresh the parched earth and make it\r\nbeautiful with foliage and flowers. Over every part of the vast Pacific\r\nOcean, whose islands must produce a minimum of dust, the sky is always\r\nblue, and its thousand isles do not suffer for want of rain. Over the great\r\nforest-plain of the Amazon valley, where the production of dust must be\r\nvery small, there is yet abundance of rain-clouds and of rain. This is due\r\nprimarily to the two great natural sources of dust--the active volcanoes,\r\ntogether with the deserts and more arid regions of the world; and, in the\r\nsecond place, to the density and wonderful mobility of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich not only carries the finest dust-particles to an enormous height, but\r\ndistributes them through its whole extent with such wonderful uniformity.\r\n\r\nEvery dust-particle is of course much heavier than air, and in a\r\ncomparatively short time, if the atmosphere were still, would fall to the\r\nground. Tyndall found that the air of a cellar under the Royal Institution\r\nin Albemarle Street, which had not been opened for several months, was so\r\npure that the path of a beam of electric light sent through it was quite\r\ninvisible. But careful experiments show that not only is the air in\r\ncontinual motion, but the motion is excessively irregular, being hardly\r\never quite horizontal, but upwards and downwards and in every intermediate\r\ndirection, as well as in countless whirls and eddies; and this complexity\r\nof motion must extend to a vast height, probably to fifty miles or more,\r\nin order to provide a sufficient thickness of those minutest particles\r\nwhich produce the blue of the sky.\r\n\r\nAll this complexity of motion is due to the action of the sun in heating\r\nthe surface of the earth, and the extreme irregularity of that surface both\r\nas regards contour and its capacity for heat-absorption. In one area we\r\nhave sand or rock or bare clay, which, when exposed to bright sunshine,\r\nbecome scorching hot; in another area we have dense vegetation, which,\r\nowing to evaporation caused by the sunshine, remains comparatively cool,\r\nand also the still cooler surfaces of rivers and Alpine lakes. But if the\r\nair were much less dense than it is, these movements would be less\r\nenergetic, while all the dust that was raised to any considerable height\r\nwould, by its own weight, fall back again to the earth much more rapidly\r\nthan it does now. There would thus be much less dust permanently in the\r\natmosphere, and this would inevitably lead to diminished rainfall and,\r\npartially, to the other injurious effects already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that vegetable organisms obtain the chief part of the\r\nnitrogen in their tissues from ammonia produced in the atmosphere and\r\ncarried into the earth by rain. This substance can only be thus produced by\r\nthe agency of electrical discharges, or lightning, which cause the\r\ncombination of the hydrogen in the aqueous vapour with the free nitrogen of\r\nthe air. But clouds are important agents in the accumulation of\r\nelectricity in sufficient amount to produce the violent discharges we know\r\nas lightning, and it is doubtful whether without them there would be any\r\ndischarges through the atmosphere capable of decomposing the aqueous vapour\r\nin it. Not only are clouds beneficial in the production of rain, and also\r\nin moderating the intensity of continuous sun-heat, but they are also\r\nrequisite for the formation of chemical compounds in vegetables which are\r\nof the highest importance to the whole animal kingdom. So far as we know,\r\nanimal life could not exist on the earth's surface without this source of\r\nnitrogen, and therefore without clouds and lightning; and these, we have\r\njust seen, depend primarily on a due proportion of dust in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut this due proportion of dust is mainly supplied by volcanoes and\r\ndeserts, and its distribution and constant presence in the air depends upon\r\nthe density of the atmosphere. This again depends on two other factors: the\r\nforce of gravity due to the mass of the planet, and the absolute quantity\r\nof the free gases constituting the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe thus find that the vast, invisible ocean of air in which we live, and\r\nwhich is so important to us that deprivation of it for a few minutes is\r\ndestructive of life, produces also many other beneficial effects of which\r\nwe usually take little account, except at times when storm or tempest, or\r\nexcessive heat or cold, remind us how delicate is the balance of conditions\r\non which our comfort, and even our lives, depend.\r\n\r\nBut the sketch I have here attempted to give of its varied functions shows\r\nus that it is really a most complex structure, a wonderful piece of\r\nmachinery, as it were, which in its various component gases, its actions\r\nand reactions upon the water and the land, its production of electrical\r\ndischarges, and its furnishing the elements from which the whole fabric of\r\norganic life is composed and perpetually renewed, may be truly considered\r\nto be the very source and foundation of life itself. This is seen, not only\r\nin the fact of our absolute dependence upon it every minute of our lives,\r\nbut in the terrible effects produced by even a slight degree of impurity in\r\nthis vital element. Yet it is among those nations that claim to be the most\r\ncivilised, those that profess to be guided by a knowledge of the laws of\r\nnature, those that most glory in the advance of science, that we find the\r\ngreatest apathy, the greatest recklessness, in continually rendering impure\r\nthis all-important necessary of life, to such a degree that the health of\r\nthe larger portion of their populations is injured and their vitality\r\nlowered, by conditions which compel them to breathe more or less foul and\r\nimpure air for the greater part of their lives. The huge and\r\never-increasing cities, the vast manufacturing towns belching forth smoke\r\nand poisonous gases, with the crowded dwellings, where millions are forced\r\nto live under the most terrible insanitary conditions, are the witnesses to\r\nthis criminal apathy, this incredible recklessness and inhumanity.\r\n\r\nFor the last fifty years and more the inevitable results of such conditions\r\nhave been fully known; yet to this day nothing of importance _has_ been\r\ndone, nothing is being done. In this beautiful land there is ample space\r\nand a superabundance of pure air for every individual. Yet our wealthy and\r\nour learned classes, our rulers and law-makers, our religious teachers and\r\nour men of science, all alike devote their lives and energies to anything\r\nor everything but this. Yet _this_ is the one great and primary essential\r\nof a people's health and well-being, to which _everything_ should, for the\r\ntime, be subordinate. Till this is done, and done thoroughly and\r\ncompletely, our civilisation is naught, our science is naught, our religion\r\nis naught, and our politics are less than naught--are utterly despicable;\r\nare below contempt.\r\n\r\nIt has been the consideration of our wonderful atmosphere in its various\r\nrelations to human life, and to all life, which has compelled me to this\r\ncry for the children and for outraged humanity. Will no body of humane men\r\nand women band themselves together, and take no rest till this crying evil\r\nis abolished, and with it nine-tenths of all the other evils that now\r\nafflict us? Let _everything_ give way to this. As in a war of conquest or\r\naggression nothing is allowed to stand in the way of victory, and all\r\nprivate rights are subordinated to the alleged public weal, so, in this war\r\nagainst filth, disease, and misery let nothing stand in the way--neither\r\nprivate interests nor vested rights--and we shall certainly conquer. This\r\nis the gospel that should be preached, in season and out of season, till\r\nthe nation listens and is convinced. Let this be our claim: Pure air and\r\npure water for every inhabitant of the British Isles. Vote for no one who\r\nsays 'It can't be done.' Vote only for those who declare 'It shall be\r\ndone.' It may take five or ten or twenty years, but all petty\r\nameliorations, all piecemeal reforms, must wait till this fundamental\r\nreform is effected. Then, when we have enabled our people to breathe pure\r\nair, and drink pure water, and live upon simple food, and work and play and\r\nrest under healthy conditions, they will be in a position to decide (for\r\nthe first time) what other reforms are really needed.\r\n\r\nRemember! We claim to be a people of high civilisation, of advanced\r\nscience, of great humanity, of enormous wealth! For very shame do not let\r\nus say 'We _cannot_ arrange matters so that our people may all breathe\r\nunpolluted, unpoisoned air!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH IS THE ONLY HABITABLE PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown in the last three chapters how numerous and how complex are\r\nthe conditions which alone render life possible on our earth, how nicely\r\nbalanced are opposing forces, and how curious and delicate are the means by\r\nwhich the essential combinations of the elements are brought about, it will\r\nbe a comparatively easy task to show how totally unfitted are all the other\r\nplanets either to develop or to preserve the higher forms of life, and, in\r\nmost cases, any forms above the lowest and most rudimentary. In order to\r\nmake this clear we will take the most important of the conditions in order,\r\nand see how the various planets fulfil them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASS OF A PLANET AND ITS ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nThe height and density of the atmosphere of a planet is important as\r\nregards life in several ways. On its density depends its power of carrying\r\nmoisture; of holding a sufficient supply of dust-particles for the\r\nformation of clouds; of carrying ultra-microscopic particles to such a\r\nheight and in such quantity as to diffuse the light of the sun by\r\nreflection from the whole sky; of raising waves in the ocean and thus\r\naerating its waters, and of producing the ocean currents which so greatly\r\nequalise temperature. Now this density depends on two factors: the mass of\r\nthe planet and the quantity of the atmospheric gases. But there is good\r\nreason to think that the latter depends directly upon the former, because\r\nit is only when a certain mass is attained that any of the lighter\r\npermanent gases can be held on the surface of a planet. Thus, according to\r\nDr. G. Johnstone Stoney, who has specially studied this subject, the moon\r\ncannot retain even such a heavy gas as carbonic acid, or the still heavier\r\ncarbon disulphide; while no particle of oxygen, nitrogen, or water-vapour\r\ncan possibly remain on it, owing to the fact of its mass being only about\r\none-eightieth that of the earth. It is believed that there are considerable\r\nquantities of gases in the stellar spaces, and probably also within the\r\nsolar system, but perhaps in the liquid or solid form. In that state they\r\nmight be attracted by any small mass such as the moon, but the heat of its\r\nsurface when exposed to the solar rays would quickly restore them to the\r\ngaseous condition, when they would at once escape.\r\n\r\nIt is only when a planet attains a mass at least a quarter that of the\r\nearth that it is capable of retaining water-vapour, one of the most\r\nessential of the gases; but with so small a mass as this, its whole\r\natmosphere would probably be so limited in amount and so rare at the\r\nplanet's surface that it would be quite unable to fulfil the various\r\npurposes for which an atmosphere is required in order to support life. For\r\ntheir adequate fulfilment the mass of a planet cannot be much less than\r\nthat of the earth. Here we come to one of those nice adjustments of which\r\nso many have been already pointed out. Dr. Johnstone Stoney arrives at the\r\nconclusion that hydrogen escapes from the earth. It is continually produced\r\nin small quantities by submarine volcanoes, by fissures in volcanic\r\nregions, from decaying vegetation, and from some other sources; yet, though\r\nsometimes found in minute quantities, it forms no regular constituent of\r\nour atmosphere.[18]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of hydrogen combined with oxygen to form the mass of water in\r\nour vast and deep oceans is enormous. Yet if it had been only one-tenth\r\nmore than it actually is, the present land-surface would have been almost\r\nall submerged. How the adjustments occurred so that there was exactly\r\nenough hydrogen to fill the vast ocean basins with water to such a depth as\r\nto leave enough land-surface for the ample development of vegetable and\r\nanimal life, and yet not so much as to be injurious to climate, it is\r\ndifficult to imagine. Yet the adjustment stares us in the face. First, we\r\nhave a satellite unique in size as compared with its primary, and\r\napparently in lateness of origin; then we have a mode of origin for that\r\nsatellite said to be certainly unique in the solar system; as a consequence\r\nof this origin, it is believed, we have enormously deep ocean basins\r\nsymmetrically placed with regard to the equator--an arrangement which is\r\nvery important for ocean circulation; then we must have had the right\r\nquantity of hydrogen, obtained in some unknown way, which formed water\r\nenough to fill these chasms, so as to leave an ample area of dry land, but\r\nwhich one-tenth more water would have ingulfed; and, lastly, we have oxygen\r\nenough left to form an atmosphere of sufficient density for all the\r\nrequirements of life. It could not be that the surplus hydrogen escaped\r\nwhen the water had been produced, because it escapes very slowly, and it\r\ncombines so easily with free oxygen by means of even a spark, as to make it\r\ncertain that _all_ the available hydrogen was used up in the oceanic\r\nwaters, and that the supply from the earth's interior has been since\r\ncomparatively small in amount.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one more adjustment to be noticed. All the facts now referred\r\nto show that the earth's mass is sufficient to bring about the conditions\r\nfavourable for life. But if our globe had been a little larger, and\r\nproportionately denser, in all probability no life would have been\r\npossible. Between a planet of 8000 and one of 9500 miles diameter is not a\r\nlarge difference, when compared with the enormous range of size of the\r\nother planets. Yet this slight increase in diameter would give two-thirds\r\nincrease in bulk, and, with a corresponding increase of density due to the\r\ngreater gravitative force, the mass would be about double what it is. But\r\nwith double the mass the quantity of gases of all sorts attracted and\r\nretained by gravity would probably have been double; and in that case there\r\nwould have been double the quantity of water produced, as no hydrogen could\r\nthen escape. But the _surface_ of the globe would only be one half greater\r\nthan at present, in which case the water would have sufficed to cover the\r\nwhole surface several miles deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITABILITY OF OTHER PLANETS\r\n\r\nWhen we look to the other planets of our system we see everywhere\r\nillustrations of the relation of size and mass to habitability. The smaller\r\nplanets, Mercury and Mars, have not sufficient mass to retain water-vapour,\r\nand, without it, they cannot be habitable. All the larger planets can have\r\nvery little solid matter, as indicated by their very low density\r\nnotwithstanding their enormous mass. There is, therefore, very good reason\r\nfor the belief that the adaptability of a planet for a full development of\r\nlife is _primarily_ dependent, within very narrow limits, on its size and,\r\nmore directly, on its mass. But if the earth owes its specially constituted\r\natmosphere and its nicely adjusted quantity of water to such general causes\r\nas here indicated, and the same causes apply to the other planets of the\r\nsolar system, then the only planet on which life can be possible is Venus.\r\nAs, however, it may be urged that exceptional causes may have given other\r\nplanets an equal advantage in the matter of air and water, we will briefly\r\nconsider some of the other conditions which we have found to be essential\r\nin the case of the earth, but which it is almost impossible to conceive as\r\nexisting, to the required extent, on any of the other planets of the solar\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SMALL AND DEFINITE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\nWe have already seen within what narrow limits the temperature on a\r\nplanet's surface must be maintained in order to develop and support life.\r\nWe have also seen how numerous and how delicate are the conditions, such as\r\ndensity of atmosphere, extent and permanence of oceans, and distribution of\r\nsea and land, which are requisite, even with us, in order to render\r\npossible the continuous preservation of a sufficiently uniform temperature.\r\nSlight alterations one way or another might render the earth almost\r\nuninhabitable, through its being liable to alternations of too great heat\r\nor excessive cold. How then can we suppose that any other of the planets,\r\nwhich have either very much more or very much less sun-heat than we\r\nreceive, could, by any possible modification of conditions, be rendered\r\ncapable of producing and supporting a full and varied life-development?\r\n\r\nMars receives less than half the amount of sun-heat per unit of surface\r\nthat we do. And as it is almost certain that it contains no water (its\r\npolar snows being caused by carbonic acid or some other heavy gas) it\r\nfollows that, although it may produce vegetable life of some low kinds, it\r\nmust be quite unsuited for that of the higher animals. Its small size and\r\nmass, the latter only one-ninth that of the earth, may probably allow it to\r\npossess a very rare atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen, if those gases exist\r\nthere, and this lack of density would render it unable to retain during the\r\nnight the very moderate amount of heat it might absorb during the day. This\r\nconclusion is supported by its low reflecting power, showing that it has\r\nhardly any clouds in its scanty atmosphere. During the greater part of the\r\ntwenty-four hours, therefore, its surface-temperature would probably be\r\nmuch below the freezing point of water; and this, taken in conjunction with\r\nthe total absence of aqueous vapour or liquid water, would add still\r\nfurther to its unsuitability for animal life.\r\n\r\nIn Venus the conditions are equally adverse in the other direction. It\r\nreceives from the sun almost double the amount of heat that we receive, and\r\nthis alone would render necessary some extraordinary combination of\r\nmodifying agencies in order to reduce and render uniform the excessively\r\nhigh temperature. But it is now known that Venus has one peculiarity which\r\nis in itself almost prohibitive of animal life, and probably of even the\r\nlowest forms of vegetable life. This peculiarity is, that through tidal\r\naction caused by the sun, its day has been made to coincide with its year,\r\nor, more properly, that it rotates on its axis in the same time that it\r\nrevolves round the sun. Hence it always presents the same face to the sun;\r\nand while one half has a perpetual day, the other half has perpetual night,\r\nwith perpetual twilight through refraction in a narrow belt adjoining the\r\nilluminated half. But the side that never receives the direct rays of the\r\nsun must be intensely cold, approximating, in the central portions, to the\r\nzero of temperature, while the half exposed to perpetual sunshine of double\r\nintensity to ours must almost certainly rise to a temperature far too great\r\nfor the existence of protoplasm, and probably, therefore, of any form of\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nVenus appears to have a dense atmosphere, and its brilliancy suggests that\r\nwe see the upper surface of a cloud-canopy, and this would no doubt greatly\r\nreduce the excessive solar heat. Its mass, being a little more than\r\nthree-fourths that of the earth, would enable it to retain the same gases\r\nas we possess. But under the extraordinary conditions that prevail on the\r\nsurface of this planet, it is hardly possible that the temperature of the\r\nilluminated side can be preserved in a sufficient state of uniformity for\r\nthe development of life in any of its higher forms.\r\n\r\nMercury possesses the same peculiarity of keeping one face always towards\r\nthe sun, and as it is so much smaller and so much nearer the sun its\r\ncontrasts of heat and cold must be still more excessive, and we need hardly\r\ndiscuss the possibility of this planet being habitable. Its mass being only\r\none-thirtieth that of the earth, water-vapour will certainly escape from\r\nit, and, most probably, nitrogen and oxygen also, so that it can possess\r\nvery little atmosphere; and this is indicated by its low reflecting power,\r\nno less than 83 per cent. of the sun's light being absorbed, and only 17\r\nper cent. reflected, whereas clouds reflect 72 per cent. This planet is\r\ntherefore intensely heated on one side and frozen on the other; it has no\r\nwater and hardly any atmosphere, and is therefore, from every point of\r\nview, totally unfitted for supporting living organisms.\r\n\r\nEven if it is supposed that, in the case of Venus, its perpetual\r\ncloud-canopy may keep down the surface temperature within the limits\r\nnecessary for animal life, the extraordinary turmoil in its atmosphere\r\ncaused by the excessively contrasted temperatures of its dark and light\r\nhemispheres must be extremely inimical to life, if not absolutely\r\nprohibitive of it. For on the greater part of the hemisphere that never\r\nreceives a ray of light or heat from the sun all the water and aqueous\r\nvapour must be turned into ice or snow, and it seems almost impossible that\r\nthe air itself can escape congelation. It could only do so by a very rapid\r\ncirculation of the whole atmosphere, and this would certainly be produced\r\nby the enormous and permanent difference of temperature between the two\r\nhemispheres. Indications of refraction by a dense atmosphere are visible\r\nduring the planet's transit over the sun's disc, and also when it is in\r\nconjunction with the sun, and the refraction is so great that Venus is\r\nbelieved to have an atmosphere much higher than ours. But during the rapid\r\ncirculation of such an atmosphere, heated on one half the planet and cooled\r\non the other, most of the aqueous vapour must be taken out of it on the\r\ndark side as fast as it is produced on the heated side, though sufficient\r\nmay remain to produce a canopy of very lofty clouds analogous to our cirri.\r\nThe occasional visibility of the dark side of Venus may be caused by an\r\nelectrical glow due to the friction of the perpetually overflowing and\r\ninflowing atmosphere, this being increased by reflection from a vast\r\nsurface of perpetual snow. If we consider all the exceptional features of\r\nthis planet, it appears certain that the conditions as regards climate\r\ncannot now be such as to maintain a temperature within the narrow limits\r\nessential for life, while there is little probability that at any earlier\r\nperiod it can have possessed and maintained the necessary stability during\r\nthe long epochs which are requisite for its development.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the condition of the larger planets, it will be well to\r\nrefer to an argument which has been supposed to minimise the difficulties\r\nalready stated as to those planets which approach nearest to the earth in\r\nsize and distance from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM EXTREME CONDITIONS ON THE EARTH\r\n\r\nIn reply to the evidence showing how nice are the adaptations required for\r\nlife-development, it is often objected that life does _now_ exist under\r\nvery extreme conditions--under tropic heat and arctic snows; in the\r\nburnt-up desert as well as in the moist tropical forest; in the air as well\r\nas in the water; on lofty mountains as well as on the level lowlands. This\r\nis no doubt true, but it does not prove that life could have been developed\r\nin a world where any of these extremes of climate characterised the whole\r\nsurface. The deserts are inhabited because there are oases where water is\r\nattainable, as well as in the surrounding fertile areas. The arctic regions\r\nare inhabited because there is a summer, and during that summer there is\r\nvegetation. If the surface of the ground were always frozen, there would be\r\nno vegetation and no animal life.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. R.A. Proctor put this argument of the diversity of conditions\r\nunder which life actually does exist on the earth as well probably as it\r\ncan be put. He says: 'When we consider the various conditions under which\r\nlife is found to prevail, that no difference of climatic relations, or of\r\nelevation, of land, or of air, or of water, of soil in land, of freshness\r\nor saltness in water, of density in air, appears (so far as our researches\r\nhave extended) to render life impossible, we are compelled to infer that\r\nthe power of supporting life is a quality which has an exceedingly wide\r\nrange in nature.'\r\n\r\nThis is true, but with certain reservations. The only species of animal\r\nwhich does really exist under the most varied conditions of climate is man,\r\nand he does so because his intellect renders him to some extent the ruler\r\nof nature. None of the lower animals have such a wide range, and the\r\ndiversity of conditions is not really so great as it appears to be. The\r\nstrict limits are nowhere permanently overpassed, and there is always the\r\nchange from winter to summer, and the possibility of migration to less\r\ninhospitable areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PLANETS ALL UNINHABITABLE\r\n\r\nHaving already shown that the condition of Mars, both as regards water,\r\natmosphere, and temperature, is quite unfitted to maintain life, a view in\r\nwhich both general principles and telescopic examination perfectly agree,\r\nwe may pass on to the outer planets, which, however, have long been given\r\nup as adapted for life even by the most ardent advocates for 'life in other\r\nworlds.' Their remoteness from the sun--even Jupiter being five times as\r\nfar as the earth, and therefore receiving only one twenty-fifth of the\r\nlight and heat that we receive per unit of surface--renders it almost\r\nimpossible, even if other conditions were favourable, that they should\r\npossess surface-temperatures adequate to the necessities of organic life.\r\nBut their very low densities, combined with very large size, renders it\r\ncertain that they none of them have a solidified surface, or even the\r\nelements from which such a surface could be formed.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that Jupiter and Saturn, as well as Uranus and Neptune,\r\nretain a considerable amount of internal heat, but certainly not sufficient\r\nto keep the metallic and other elements of which the sun and earth consist\r\nin a state of vapour, for if so they would be planetary stars and would\r\nshine by their own light. And if any considerable portion of their bulk\r\nconsisted of these elements, whether in a solid or a liquid state, their\r\ndensities would necessarily be much greater than that of the earth instead\r\nof very much less--Jupiter is under one-fourth the density of the earth,\r\nSaturn under an eighth, while Uranus and Neptune are of intermediate\r\ndensities, though much less in bulk even than Saturn.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the solar system consists of two groups of planets\r\nwhich differ widely from each other. The outer group of four very large\r\nplanets are almost wholly gaseous, and probably consist of the permanent\r\ngases--those which can only be liquefied or solidified at a very low\r\ntemperature. In no other way can their small density combined with enormous\r\nbulk be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe inner group also of four planets are totally unlike the preceding. They\r\nare all of small size, the earth being the largest. They are all of a\r\ndensity roughly proportionate to their bulk. The earth is both the largest\r\nand the densest of the group; not only is it situated at that distance from\r\nthe sun which, through solar heat alone, allows water to remain in the\r\nliquid state over almost the whole of its surface, but it possesses\r\nnumerous characteristics which secure a very equable temperature, and which\r\nhave secured to it very nearly the same temperature during those enormous\r\ngeological periods in which terrestrial life has existed. We have already\r\nshown that no other planet possesses these characteristics now, and it is\r\nalmost equally certain that they never have possessed them in the past, and\r\nnever will possess them in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAST ARGUMENT FOR HABITABILITY OF THE PLANETS\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been admitted by the late Mr. Proctor and some other\r\nastronomers that most of the planets are not _now_ habitable, yet, it is\r\noften urged, they may have been so in the past or may become so in the\r\nfuture. Some are now too hot, others are now too cold; some have now no\r\nwater, others have too much; but all go through their appointed series of\r\nstages, and during some of these stages life may be or may have been\r\npossible. This argument, although vague, will appeal to some readers, and\r\nit may, therefore, be necessary to reply to it. This is the more necessary\r\nas it is still made use of by astronomers. In a criticism of my article in\r\n_The Fortnightly Review_, M. Camille Flammarion, of the Paris Observatory,\r\ndramatically remarks: 'Yes, life is universal, and eternal, for time is one\r\nof its factors. Yesterday the moon, to-day the earth, to-morrow Jupiter. In\r\nspace there are both cradles and tombs.'[19]\r\n\r\nIt is thus suggested that the moon was once inhabited and that Jupiter will\r\nbe inhabited in some remote future; but no attempt is made to deal with the\r\nessential physical conditions of these very diverse objects, rendering them\r\nnot only _now_, but always, unfitted to develop and to maintain terrestrial\r\nor aerial life. This vague supposition--it can hardly be termed an\r\nargument--as regards past or future adaptability for life, of all the\r\nplanets and some of the satellites in the solar system, is, however,\r\nrendered invalid by an equally general objection to which its upholders\r\nappear never to have given a moment's consideration; and as it is an\r\nobjection which still further enforces the view as to the unique position\r\nof the earth in the solar system, it will be well to submit it to the\r\njudgment of our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITATION OF THE SUN'S HEAT\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there is, and has been for nearly half a century, a\r\nprofound difference of opinion between geologists and physicists as to the\r\nactual or possible duration in years of life upon the earth. The\r\ngeologists, being greatly impressed with the vast results produced by the\r\nslow processes of the wearing away of the rocks and the deposit of the\r\nmaterial in seas or lakes, to be again upheaved to form dry land, and to be\r\nagain carved out by rain and wind, by heat and cold, by snow and ice, into\r\nhills and valleys and grand mountain ranges; and further, by the fact that\r\nthe highest mountains in every part of the globe very often exhibit on\r\ntheir loftiest summits stratified rocks which contain marine organisms, and\r\nwere therefore originally laid down beneath the sea; and, yet again, by\r\nthe fact that the loftiest mountains are often the most recent, and that\r\nthese grand features of the earth's surface are but the latest examples of\r\nthe action of forces that have been at work throughout all geological\r\ntime--studying all their lives the detailed evidences of all these changes,\r\nhave come to the conclusion that they imply enormous periods only to be\r\nmeasured by scores or hundreds of millions of years.\r\n\r\nAnd the collateral study of fossil remains in the long series of\r\nrock-formations enforces this view. In the whole epoch of human history,\r\nand far back into prehistoric times during which man existed on the earth,\r\nalthough several animals have become extinct, yet there is no proof that\r\nany new one has been developed. But this human era, so far as yet known,\r\ngoing back certainly to the glacial epoch and almost certainly to\r\npre-glacial times, cannot be estimated at less than a million, some think\r\neven several million years; and as there have certainly been some\r\nconsiderable alterations of level, excavation of valleys, deposits of great\r\nbeds of gravel, and other superficial changes during this period, some kind\r\nof a scale of measurement of geological time has been obtained, by\r\ncomparison with the very minute changes that have occurred during the\r\nhistorical period. This scale is admittedly a very imperfect one, but it is\r\nbetter than none at all; and it is by comparing these small changes with\r\nthe far greater ones which have occurred during every successive step\r\nbackward in geological history that these estimates of geological time have\r\nbeen arrived at. They are also supported by the palæontologists, to whom\r\nthe vast panorama of successive forms of life is an ever-present reality.\r\nDirectly they pass into the latest stage of the Tertiary period--the\r\nPliocene of Sir Charles Lyell--all over the world new forms of life appear\r\nwhich are evidently the forerunners of many of our still existing species;\r\nand as they go a little further back, into the Miocene, there are\r\nindications of a warmer climate in Europe, and large numbers of mammals\r\nresembling those which now inhabit the tropics, but of quite distinct\r\nspecies and often of distinct genera and families. And here, though we have\r\nonly reached to about the middle of the Tertiary period, the changes in the\r\nforms of life, in the climate, and in the land-surfaces are so great when\r\ncompared with the very minute changes during the human epoch, as to require\r\nus to multiply the time elapsed many times over. Yet the whole of the\r\nTertiary period, during which _all_ the great groups of the higher animals\r\nwere developed from a comparatively few generalised ancestral forms, is yet\r\nthe shortest by far of the three great geological periods--the Mesozoic or\r\nSecondary, having been much longer, with still vaster changes both in the\r\nearth's crust and in the forms of life; while the Palæozoic or Primary,\r\nwhich carries us back to the earliest forms of life as represented by\r\nfossilised remains, is always estimated by geologists to be at least as\r\nlong as the other two combined, and probably very much longer.\r\n\r\nFrom these various considerations most geologists who have made any\r\nestimates of geological time from the period of the earliest fossiliferous\r\nrocks, have arrived at the conclusion that about 200 millions of years are\r\nrequired. But from the variety of the forms of life at this early period\r\nit is concluded that a very much greater duration is needed for the whole\r\nepoch of life. Speaking of the varied marine fauna of the Cambrian period,\r\nthe late Professor Ramsay says:--'In this earliest known varied life we\r\nfind no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of the zoological\r\nseries. In a broad sense, compared with what must have gone before, both\r\nbiologically and physically, all the phenomena connected with this old\r\nperiod seem, to my mind, to be of quite a recent description; and the\r\nclimates of seas and lands were of the very same kind as those the world\r\nenjoys at the present day.' And Professor Huxley held very similar views\r\nwhen he declared: 'If the very small differences which are observable\r\nbetween the crocodiles of the older Secondary formations and those of the\r\npresent day furnish any sort of an approximation towards an estimate of the\r\naverage rate of change among reptiles, it is almost appalling to reflect\r\nhow far back in Palæozoic times we must go before we can hope to arrive at\r\nthat common stock from which the crocodiles, lizards, _Ornithoscelida_, and\r\n_Plesiosauria_, which had attained so great a development in the Triassic\r\nepoch, must have been derived.'\r\n\r\nNow, in opposition to these demands of the geologists, in which they are\r\nalmost unanimous, the most celebrated physicists, after full consideration\r\nof all possible sources of the heat of the sun, and knowing the rate at\r\nwhich it is now expending heat, declare, with complete conviction, that our\r\nsun cannot have existed as a heat-giving body for so long a period, and\r\nthey would therefore reduce the time during which life can possibly have\r\nexisted on the earth to about one-fourth of that demanded by geologists.\r\nIn one of his latest articles, Lord Kelvin says:--'Now we have irrefragable\r\ndynamics proving that the whole life of our sun as a luminary is a very\r\nmoderate number of million years, probably less than 50 million, possibly\r\nbetween 50 and 100' (_Phil. Mag._, vol. ii., Sixth Ser., p. 175, Aug.\r\n1901). In my _Island Life_ (chap. X.) I have myself given reasons for\r\nthinking that both the stratigraphical and biological changes may have gone\r\non more quickly than has been supposed, and that geological time (meaning\r\nthereby the time during which the development of life upon the earth has\r\nbeen going on) may be reduced so as possibly to be brought within the\r\nmaximum period allowed by physicists; but there will certainly be no time\r\nto spare, and any planets dependent on our sun whose period of habitability\r\nis either past or to come, cannot possibly have, or have had, sufficient\r\ntime for the necessarily slow evolution of the higher life-forms. Again,\r\nall physicists hold that the sun is now cooling, and that its future life\r\nwill be much less than its past. In a lecture at the Royal Institution\r\n(published in _Nature Series_, in 1889), Lord Kelvin says:--'It would, I\r\nthink, be exceedingly rash to assume as probable anything more than twenty\r\nmillion years of the sun's light in the past history of the earth, or to\r\nreckon more than five or six million years of sunlight for time to come.'\r\n\r\nThese extracts serve to show that, unless either geologists or physicists\r\nare very far from any approach to accuracy in their estimates of past or\r\nfuture age of the sun, there is very great difficulty in bringing them into\r\nharmony or in accounting for the actual facts of the geological history of\r\nthe earth and of the whole course of life-development upon it. We are,\r\ntherefore, again brought to the conclusion that there has been, and is, no\r\ntime to spare; that the _whole_ of the available past life-period of the\r\nsun has been utilised for life-development on the earth, and that the\r\nfuture will be not much more than may be needed for the completion of the\r\ngrand drama of human history, and the development of the full possibilities\r\nof the mental and moral nature of man.\r\n\r\nWe have here, then, a very powerful argument, from a different point of\r\nview than any previously considered, for the conclusion that man's place in\r\nthe solar system is altogether unique, and that no other planet either has\r\ndeveloped or can develop such a full and complete life-series as that which\r\nthe earth has actually developed. Even if the conditions had been more\r\nfavourable than they are seen to be on other planets, Mercury, Venus, and\r\nMars could not possibly have preserved equability of conditions long enough\r\nfor life-development, since for unknown ages they must have been passing\r\nslowly towards their present wholly _unsuitable_ conditions; while Jupiter\r\nand the planets beyond him, whose epoch of life-development is supposed to\r\nbe in the remote future when they shall have slowly cooled down to\r\nhabitability, will then be still more faintly illuminated and scantily\r\nwarmed by a rapidly cooling sun, and may thus become, at the best, globes\r\nof solid ice. This is the teaching of science--of the best science of the\r\ntwentieth century. Yet we find even astronomers who, more than any other\r\nexponents of science, should give heed to the teachings of the sister\r\nsciences to which they owe so much, indulging in such rhapsodies as the\r\nfollowing:--'In our solar system, this little earth has not obtained any\r\nspecial privileges from Nature, and it is strange to wish to confine life\r\nwithin the circle of terrestrial chemistry.' And again: 'Infinity\r\nencompasses us on all sides, life asserts itself, universal and eternal,\r\nour existence is but a fleeting moment, the vibration of an atom in a ray\r\nof the sun, and our planet is but an island floating in the celestial\r\narchipelago, to which no thought will ever place any bounds.'[20]\r\n\r\nIn place of such 'wild and whirling words,' I have endeavoured to state the\r\nsober conclusions of the best workers and thinkers as to the nature and\r\norigin of the world in which we live, and of the universe which on all\r\nsides surrounds us. I leave it to my readers to decide which is the more\r\ntrustworthy guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] _Transactions of Royal Dublin Society_, vol. vi. (ser. ii.), part\r\nxiii.

ARE THEY BENEFICIAL TO US?\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the writers on the Plurality of Worlds, from Fontenelle to Proctor,\r\ntaking into consideration the enormous number of the stars and their\r\napparent uselessness to our world, have assumed that many of them _must_\r\nhave systems of planets circling round them, and that some of these\r\nplanets, at all events, _must_ possess inhabitants, some, perhaps, lower,\r\nbut others no doubt higher than ourselves. One of our well-known modern\r\nastronomers, writing only ten years ago, adopts the same view. He says:\r\n'The suns which we call stars were clearly not created for our benefit.\r\nThey are of very little practical use to the earth's inhabitants. They give\r\nus very little light; an additional small satellite--one considerably\r\nsmaller than the moon--would have been much more useful in this respect\r\nthan the millions of stars revealed by the telescope. They must therefore\r\nhave been formed for some other purpose.... We may therefore conclude, with\r\na high degree of probability, that the stars--at least those with spectra\r\nof the solar type--form centres of planetary systems somewhat similar to\r\nour own.'[21] The author then discusses the conditions necessary for life\r\nanalogous to that of our earth, as regards temperature, rotation, mass,\r\natmosphere, water, etc., and he is the only writer I have met with who has\r\nconsidered these conditions; but he touches on them very briefly, and he\r\narrives at the conclusion that, in the case of the stars of solar type, it\r\nis probable that _one_ planet, situated at a proper distance, would be\r\nfitted to support life. He estimates roughly that there are about ten\r\nmillion stars of this type, that is, closely resembling our sun, and that\r\nif only one in ten of these has a planet at the proper distance and\r\nproperly constituted in other respects, there will be one million worlds\r\nfitted for the support of animal life. He therefore concludes that there\r\nare probably many stars having life-bearing planets revolving round them.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many considerations not taken account of by this writer\r\nwhich tend to reduce very considerably the above estimate. It is now known\r\nthat immense numbers of the stars of smaller magnitudes are nearer to us\r\nthan are the majority of the stars of the first and second magnitudes, so\r\nthat it is probable that these, as well as a considerable proportion of the\r\nvery faint telescopic stars, are really of small dimensions. We have\r\nevidence that many of the brightest stars are much larger than our sun, but\r\nthere are probably ten times as many that are much smaller. We have seen\r\nthat the whole of the past light and heat-giving duration of our sun has,\r\naccording to the best authorities, been only just sufficient for the\r\ndevelopment of life upon the earth. But the duration of a sun's heat-giving\r\npower will depend mainly upon its mass, together with its constituent\r\nelements. Suns which are much smaller than ours are, therefore, from that\r\ncause alone, unsuited to give adequate light and heat for a sufficient\r\ntime, and with sufficient uniformity, for life-development on planets, even\r\nif they possess any at the right distance, and with the extensive series of\r\nnicely adjusted conditions which I have shown to be necessary.\r\n\r\nAgain, we must, probably, rule out as unfitted for life-development the\r\nwhole region of the Milky Way, on account of the excessive forces there in\r\naction, as shown by the immense size of many of the stars, their enormous\r\nheat-giving power, the crowding of stars and nebulous matter, the great\r\nnumber of star-clusters, and, especially, because it is the region of 'new\r\nstars,' which imply collisions of masses of matter sufficiently large to\r\nbecome visible from the immense distance we are from them, but yet\r\nexcessively small as compared with suns the duration of whose light is to\r\nbe measured by millions of years. Hence the Milky Way is the theatre of\r\nextreme activity and motion; it is comparatively crowded with matter\r\nundergoing continual change, and is therefore not sufficiently stable for\r\nlong periods to be at all likely to possess habitable worlds.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, limit our possible planetary systems suitable for\r\nlife-development, to stars situated inside the circle of the Milky Way and\r\nfar removed from it--that is, to those composing the solar cluster. These\r\nhave been variously estimated to consist of a few hundred or many thousand\r\nstars--at all events to a very small number as compared with the 'hundreds\r\nof millions' in the whole stellar universe. But even here we find that\r\nonly a portion are probably suitable. Professor Newcomb arrives at the\r\nconclusion--as have some other astronomers--that the stars in general have\r\na much smaller mass in proportion to the light they give than our sun has;\r\nand, after an elaborate discussion, he finally concludes that the brighter\r\nstars are, on the average, much less dense than our sun. In all\r\nprobability, therefore, they cannot give light and heat for so long a\r\nperiod, and as this period in the case of our sun has only been just\r\nsufficient, the number of suns of the solar type and of a sufficient mass\r\nmay be very limited. Yet further, even among stars having a similar\r\nphysical constitution to our sun and of an equal or greater mass, only a\r\nportion of their period of luminosity would be suitable for the support of\r\nplanetary life. While they are in process of formation by accretions of\r\nsolid or gaseous masses, they would be subject to such fluctuations of\r\ntemperature, and to such catastrophic outbursts when any larger mass than\r\nusual was drawn towards them, that the whole of this period--perhaps by far\r\nthe longest portion of their existence--must be left out of the account of\r\nplanet-producing suns. Yet all these are to us stars of various degrees of\r\nbrilliancy. It is almost certain that it is only when the growth of a sun\r\nis nearly completed, and its heat has attained a maximum, that the epoch of\r\nlife-development is likely to begin upon any planets it may possess at the\r\nmost suitable distance, and upon which all the requisite conditions should\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there are great numbers of stars beyond our solar\r\ncluster and yet within the circle of the Milky Way, as well as others\r\ntowards the poles of the Milky Way, which I have not here referred to. But\r\nof these regions very little is known, because it is impossible to tell\r\nwhether stars in these directions are situated in the outer portion of the\r\nsolar cluster or in the regions beyond it. Some astronomers appear to think\r\nthat these regions may be nearly empty of stars, and I have endeavoured to\r\nrepresent what seems to be the general view on this very difficult subject\r\nin the two diagrams of the stellar universe at pp. 300, 301. The regions\r\nbeyond our cluster and above or below the plane of the Milky Way are those\r\nwhere the small irresolvable nebulæ abound, and these may indicate that\r\nsun-formation is not yet active in those regions. The two charts of Nebulæ\r\nand Clusters at the end of the volume illustrate, and perhaps tend to\r\nsupport this view.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STAR SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, in our sixth chapter, how rapid and extraordinary has\r\nbeen the discovery of what are termed spectroscopic binaries--pairs of\r\nstars so close together as to appear like a single star in the most\r\npowerful telescopes. The systematic search for such stars has only been\r\ncarried on for a few years, yet so many have been already found, and their\r\nnumbers are increasing so rapidly, as to quite startle astronomers. One of\r\nthe chief workers in this field, Professor Campbell of the Lick\r\nObservatory, has stated his opinion that, as accuracy of measurement\r\nincreases, these discoveries will go on till--'the star that is not a\r\nspectroscopic binary will prove to be the rare exception,'--and other\r\nastronomers of eminence have expressed similar views. But these close\r\nrevolving star-systems are generally admitted to be out of the category of\r\nlife-producing suns. The tidal disturbances mutually produced must be\r\nenormous, and this must be inimical to the development of planets, unless\r\nthey were very close to each sun, and thus in the most unfavourable\r\nposition for life.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the result of the most recent researches among the stars\r\nis entirely opposed to the old idea that the countless myriads of stars\r\n_all_ had planets circulating round them, and that the ultimate purpose of\r\ntheir existence was, that they should be supporters of life, as our sun is\r\nthe supporter of life upon the earth. So far is this from being the case,\r\nthat vast numbers of stars have to be put aside as wholly unfitted for such\r\na purpose; and when by successive eliminations of this nature we have\r\nreduced the numbers which may possibly be available to a few millions, or\r\neven to a few thousands, there comes the last startling discovery, that the\r\nentire host of stars is found to contain binary systems in such rapidly\r\nincreasing numbers, as to lead some of the very first astronomers of the\r\nday to the conclusion that single stars may someday be found to be the rare\r\nexception! But this tremendous generalisation would, at one stroke, sweep\r\naway a large proportion of the stars which other successive\r\ndisqualifications had spared, and thus leave our sun, which is certainly\r\nsingle, and perhaps two or three companion orbs, alone among the starry\r\nhost as possible supporters of life on some one of the planets which\r\ncirculate around them.\r\n\r\nBut we do not really _know_ that any such suns exist. If they exist we do\r\nnot _know_ that they possess planets. If any do possess planets these may\r\nnot be at the proper distance, or be of the proper mass, to render life\r\npossible. If these primary conditions should be fulfilled, and if there\r\nshould possibly be not only one or two, but a dozen or more that so far\r\nfulfil the first few conditions which are essential, what probability is\r\nthere that all the other conditions, all the other nice adaptations, all\r\nthe delicate balance of opposing forces that we have found to prevail upon\r\nthe earth, and whose combination here is due to exceptional conditions\r\nwhich exist in the case of no other known planet--should _all_ be again\r\ncombined in some of the possible planets of these possibly existing suns?\r\n\r\nI submit that the probability is _now_ all the other way. So long as we\r\ncould assume that all the stars might be, in all essentials, like our sun,\r\nit seemed almost ludicrous to suppose that our sun alone should be in a\r\nposition to support life. But when we find that enormous classes like the\r\ngaseous stars of small density, the solar stars while increasing in size\r\nand temperature, the stars which are much smaller than our sun, the\r\nnebulous stars, probably all the stars of the Milky Way, and lastly that\r\nenormous class of spectroscopic doubles--veritable Aaron's rods which\r\nthreaten to swallow up all the rest--that all these are for various reasons\r\nunlikely to have attendant planets adapted to develop life, then the\r\nprobabilities seem to be enormously against there being any considerable\r\nnumber of suns possessing attendant habitable earths. Just as the\r\nhabitability of all the planets and larger satellites, once assumed as so\r\nextremely probable as to amount almost to a certainty, is now generally\r\ngiven up, so that in speculating on life in stellar systems Mr. Gore\r\nassumes that only _one_ planet to each sun can be habitable; in like manner\r\nit may, and I believe will, turn out, that of all the myriad stars, the\r\nmore we learn about them, the smaller and smaller will become the scanty\r\nresidue which, with any probability, we can suppose to illuminate and\r\nvivify habitable earths. And when with this scanty probability we combine\r\nthe still scantier probability that any such planet will possess\r\nsimultaneously, and for a sufficiently long period, _all_ the highly\r\ncomplex and delicately balanced conditions known to be essential for a full\r\nlife-development, the conception that on this earth alone has such\r\ndevelopment been completed will not seem so wildly improbable a conjecture\r\nas it has hitherto been held to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THE STARS BENEFICIAL TO US?\r\n\r\nWhen I suggested in my first publication on this subject that some\r\nemanations from the stars _might_ be beneficial or injurious, and that a\r\ncentral position _might_ be essential in order to render these emanations\r\nequable, one of my astronomical critics laughed the idea to scorn, and\r\ndeclared that 'we might wander into outer space without losing anything\r\nmore serious than we lose when the night is cloudy and we cannot see the\r\nstars.'[22] How my critic knows that this is so he does not tell us. He\r\nstates it positively, with no qualification, as if it were an established\r\nfact. It may be as well to inquire, therefore, if there is any evidence\r\nbearing upon the point at issue.\r\n\r\nAstronomers are so fully occupied with the vast number and variety of the\r\nphenomena presented by the stellar universe and the various difficult\r\nproblems arising therefrom, that many lesser but still interesting\r\ninquiries have necessarily received little attention. Such a minor problem\r\nis the determination of how much heat or other active radiation we receive\r\nfrom the stars; yet a few observations have been made with results that are\r\nof considerable interest.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1900 and 1901 Mr. E.F. Nichols of the Yerkes Observatory made\r\na series of experiments with a radiometer of special construction, to\r\ndetermine the heat emitted by certain stars. The result arrived at was,\r\nthat Vega gave about 1/200000000 of the heat of a candle at one metre\r\ndistance, and Arcturus about 2.2 times as much.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 and 1896 Mr. G.M. Minchin made a series of experiments on the\r\n_Electrical Measurement of Starlight_, by means of a photo-electric cell of\r\npeculiar construction which is sensitive to the whole of the rays in the\r\nspectrum, and also to some of the ultra-red and ultra-violet rays. Combined\r\nwith this was a very delicate electrometer. The telescope employed to\r\nconcentrate the light was a reflector of two feet aperture.

We must therefore diminish the amount of candle\r\nlight in this table in the proportion of the square of the diameter of the\r\nmirror (in 1/20 of an inch) to one, equal to 1/230400. If we make the\r\nnecessary reduction in the case of Vega, and also equalise the distance at\r\nwhich the candle was placed, we find the following result:--\r\n\r\n    Observer.

And this is further shown by the fact\r\nthat, whereas Mr. Nichols found Arcturus a red star, hotter than Vega a\r\nwhite one, Mr. Minchin, measuring also the light-giving and some of the\r\nchemical rays, found Vega considerably more energetic than Arcturus. These\r\ncomparisons also suggest that other modes of measurement might give yet\r\nhigher results, but it will no doubt be urged that such minute effects must\r\nnecessarily be quite inoperative upon the organic world.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some considerations which tend the other way. Mr.\r\nMinchin remarks on the unexpected fact that Betelgeuse produces more than\r\ndouble the electrical energy of Procyon, a much brighter star. This\r\nindicates that many of the stars of smaller visual magnitudes may give out\r\na large amount of energy, and it is this energy, which we now know can take\r\nmany strange and varied forms, that would be likely to influence organic\r\nlife. And as to the quantity being too minute to have any effect, we know\r\nthat the excessively minute amount of light from the very smallest\r\ntelescopic stars produces such chemical changes on a photographic plate as\r\nto form distinct images, with comparatively small lenses or reflectors and\r\nwith an exposure of two or three hours. And if it were not that the\r\ndiffused light of the surrounding sky also acts upon the plate and blurs\r\nthe faint images, much smaller stars could be photographed.\r\n\r\nWe know that not all the rays, but a portion only, are capable of producing\r\nthese effects; we know also that there are many kinds of radiation from the\r\nstars, and probably some yet undiscovered comparable with the X rays and\r\nother new forms of radiation. We must also remember the endless variety\r\nand the extreme instability of the protoplasmic products in the living\r\norganism, many of which are perhaps as sensitive to special rays as is the\r\nphotographic plate.\r\n\r\nAnd we are not here limited to action for a few minutes or a few hours, but\r\nthroughout the whole night and day, and continued whenever the sky is clear\r\nfor months or years. Thus the cumulative effect of these very weak\r\nradiations may become important. It is probable that their action would be\r\nmost influential on plants, and here we find all the conditions requisite\r\nfor its accumulation and utilisation in the large amount of leaf-surface\r\nexposed to it. A large tree must present some hundreds of superficial feet\r\nof receptive surface, while even shrubs and herbs often have a leaf-area of\r\ngreater superficial extent than the object-glasses of our largest\r\ntelescopes. Some of the highly complex chemical processes that go on in\r\nplants may be helped by these radiations, and their action would be\r\nincreased by the fact that, coming from every direction over the whole\r\nsurface of the heavens, the rays from the stars would be able to reach and\r\nact upon every leaf of the densest masses of foliage. The large amount of\r\ngrowth that takes place at night may be in part due to this agency.\r\n\r\nOf course all this is highly speculative; but I submit, in view of the fact\r\nthat the light of the very faintest stars _does_ produce distinct chemical\r\nchanges, that even the very minute heat-effects are measureable, as well as\r\nthe electro-motive forces caused by them; and further, that when we\r\nconsider the millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of stars, all acting\r\nsimultaneously on any organism which may be sensitive to them, the\r\nsupposition that they do produce some effect, and possibly a very important\r\neffect, is not one to be summarily rejected as altogether absurd and not\r\nworth inquiring into.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, these possible direct actions of the stars upon living\r\norganisms to which I attach much weight as regards our central position in\r\nthe stellar universe. Further consideration of the subject has convinced me\r\nthat the fundamental importance of that position is a physical one, as has\r\nalready been suggested by Sir Norman Lockyer and some other astronomers.\r\nBriefly, the central position appears to be the only one where suns can be\r\nsufficiently stable and long-lived to be capable of maintaining the long\r\nprocess of life-development in any of the planets they may possess. This\r\npoint will be further developed in the next (and concluding) chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] _The Worlds of Space_, by J.E. Gore, chapter iii.\r\n\r\n[22] _The Fortnightly Review_, April 1903, p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSTABILITY OF THE STAR-SYSTEM: IMPORTANCE OF OUR CENTRAL POSITION: SUMMARY\r\nAND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties with regard to the vast system of stars\r\naround us is the question of its permanence and stability, if not\r\nabsolutely and indefinitely, yet for periods sufficiently long to allow for\r\nthe many millions of years that have certainly been required for our\r\nterrestrial life-development. This period, in the case of the earth, as I\r\nhave sufficiently shown, has been characterised throughout by extreme\r\nuniformity, while a continuance of that uniformity for a few millions of\r\nyears in the future is almost equally certain.\r\n\r\nBut our mathematical astronomers can find no indications of such stability\r\nof the stellar universe as a whole, if subject to the law of gravitation\r\nalone. In reply to some questions on this point, my friend Professor George\r\nDarwin writes as follows:--'A symmetrical annular system of bodies might\r\nrevolve in a circle with or without a central body. Such a system would be\r\nunstable. If the bodies are of unequal masses and not symmetrically\r\ndisposed, the break-up of the system would probably be more rapid than in\r\nthe ideal case of symmetry.'\r\n\r\nThis would imply that the great annular system of the Milky Way is\r\nunstable. But if so, its existence at all is a greater mystery than ever.\r\nAlthough in detail its structure is very irregular, as a whole it is\r\nwonderfully symmetrical; and it seems quite impossible that its generally\r\ncircular ring-like form can be the result of the chance aggregation of\r\nmatter from any pre-existing different form. Star-clusters are equally\r\nunstable, or, rather, nothing is known or can be predicated about their\r\nstability or instability, according to Professors Newcomb and Darwin.\r\n\r\nMr. E.T. Whittaker (Secretary to the Royal Astronomical Society), to whom\r\nProfessor G. Darwin sent my questions, writes:--'I doubt whether the\r\nprincipal phenomena of the stellar universe are consequences of the law of\r\ngravitation at all. I have been working myself at spiral nebulæ, and have\r\ngot a first approximation to an explanation--but it is electro-dynamical\r\nand not gravitational. In fact, it may be questioned whether, for bodies of\r\nsuch tremendous extent as the Milky Way or nebulæ, the effect which we call\r\ngravitation is given by Newton's law; just as the ordinary formulæ of\r\nelectrostatic attraction break down when we consider charges moving with\r\nvery great velocities.'\r\n\r\nAccepting these statements and opinions of two mathematicians who have\r\ngiven special attention to similar problems, we need not limit ourselves to\r\nthe laws of gravitation as having determined the present form of the\r\nstellar universe; and this is the more important because we may thus escape\r\nfrom a conclusion which many astronomers seem to think inevitable, viz.\r\nthat the observed proper motions of the stars cannot be explained by the\r\ngravitative forces of the system itself. In chapter VIII. of this work I\r\nhave quoted Professor Newcomb's calculation as to the effect of gravitation\r\nin a universe of 100 million stars, each five times the mass of our sun,\r\nand spread over a sphere which it would take light 30,000 years to cross;\r\nthen, a body falling from its outer limits to the centre could at the\r\nutmost acquire a velocity of twenty-five miles a second; and therefore, any\r\nbody in any part of such a universe having a greater velocity would pass\r\naway into infinite space. Now, as several stars have, it is believed, much\r\nmore than this velocity, it follows not only that they will inevitably\r\nescape from our universe, but that they do not belong to it, as their great\r\nvelocity must have been acquired elsewhere. This seems to have been the\r\nidea of the astronomer who stated that, even at the very moderate speed of\r\nour sun, we should in five million years be deep in the actual stream of\r\nthe Milky Way. To this I have already sufficiently replied; but I now wish\r\nto bring before my readers an excellent illustration of the importance of\r\nthe late Professor Huxley's remark, that the results you got out of the\r\n'mathematical mill' depend entirely on what you put into it.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophical Magazine_ (January 1902) is a remarkable article by\r\nLord Kelvin, in which he discusses the very same problem as that which\r\nProfessor Newcomb had discussed at a much earlier date, but, starting from\r\ndifferent assumptions, equally based on ascertained facts and probabilities\r\ndeduced from them, brings out a very different result.\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin postulates a sphere of such a radius that a star at its\r\nconfines would have a parallax of one-thousandth part of a second (0\".001),\r\nequivalent to 3215 light-years. Uniformly distributed through this sphere\r\nthere is matter equal in mass to 1000 million suns like ours. If this\r\nmatter becomes subject to gravitation, it all begins to move at first with\r\nalmost infinite slowness, especially near its centre; but nevertheless, in\r\ntwenty-five million years many of these suns would have acquired velocities\r\nof from twelve to twenty miles a second, while some would have less and\r\nsome probably more than seventy miles a second. Now such velocities as\r\nthese agree generally with the measured velocities of the stars, hence Lord\r\nKelvin thinks there may be as much matter as 1000 million suns within the\r\nabove-named distance. He then states that if we suppose there to be 10,000\r\nmillion suns within the same sphere, velocities would be produced very much\r\ngreater than the known star-velocities; hence it is probable that there is\r\nvery much less matter than 10,000 million times the sun's mass. He also\r\nstates that if the matter were not uniformly distributed within the sphere,\r\nthen, whatever was the irregularity, the acquired motions would be greater;\r\nagain indicating that the 1000 million suns would be ample to produce the\r\nobserved effects of stellar motion. He then calculates the average distance\r\napart of each of the 1000 million stars, which he finds to be about 300\r\nmillions of millions of miles. Now the nearest star to our sun is about\r\ntwenty-six million million of miles distant, and, as the evidence shows, is\r\nsituated in the denser part of the solar cluster. This gives ample\r\nallowance for the comparative emptiness of the space between our cluster\r\nand the Milky Way, as well as of the whole region towards the poles of the\r\nMilky Way (as shown by the diagrams in chapter IV.), while the comparative\r\ndensity of extensive portions of the Galaxy itself may serve to make up the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nNow, previous writers have come to a different conclusion from the same\r\ngeneral line of argument, because they have started with different\r\nassumptions. Professor Newcomb, whose statement made some years back is\r\nusually followed, assumed 100 million stars each five times as large as our\r\nsun, equal to 500 million suns in all, and he distributed them equally\r\nthroughout a sphere 30,000 light-years in diameter. Thus he has half the\r\namount of matter assumed by Lord Kelvin, but nearly five times the extent,\r\nthe result being that gravity could only produce a maximum speed of\r\ntwenty-five miles a second; whereas on Lord Kelvin's assumption a maximum\r\nspeed of seventy miles a second would be produced, or even more. By this\r\nlatter calculation we find no insuperable difficulty in the speed of any of\r\nthe stars being beyond the power of gravitation to produce, because the\r\nrates here given are the direct results of gravitation acting on bodies\r\nalmost uniformly distributed through space. Irregular distribution, such as\r\nwe see everywhere in the universe, might lead to both greater and less\r\nvelocities; and if we further take account of collisions and near\r\napproaches of large masses resulting in explosive disruptions, we might\r\nhave almost any amount of motion as the result, but as this motion would\r\nbe produced by gravitation within the system, it could equally well be\r\ncontrolled by gravitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF STELLAR UNIVERSE (Plan). 1. Central part of Solar\r\nCluster. 2. Sun's Orbit (Black spot). 3. Outer limit of Solar Cluster. 4.\r\nMilky Way.]\r\n\r\nIn order that my readers may better understand the calculations of Lord\r\nKelvin, and also the general conclusions of astronomers as to the form and\r\ndimensions of the stellar universe, I have drawn two diagrams, one showing\r\na plan on the central plane of the Milky Way, the other a section through\r\nits poles. Both are on the same scale, and they show the total diameter\r\nacross the Milky Way as being 3600 light-years, or about half that\r\npostulated by Lord Kelvin for his hypothetical universe. I do this because\r\nthe dimensions given by him are those which are sufficient to lead to\r\nmotions near the centre such as the stars now possess in a minimum period\r\nof twenty-five million years after the initial arrangement he supposes, at\r\nwhich later epoch which we are now supposed to have reached, the whole\r\nsystem would of course be greatly reduced in extent by aggregations\r\ntowards and near the centre. These dimensions also seem to accord\r\nsufficiently with the actual distances of stars as yet measured. The\r\nsmallest parallax which has been determined with any certainty, according\r\nto Professor Newcomb's list, is that of Gamma Cassiopeiæ, which is\r\none-hundredth of a second (0\".01), while Lord Kelvin gives none smaller\r\nthan 0\".02, and these will all be included within the solar cluster as I\r\nhave shown it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF STELLAR UNIVERSE (Section). Section through Poles\r\nof Milky Way.]\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that these two illustrations are merely\r\ndiagrams to show the main features of the stellar universe according to the\r\nbest information available, with the proportionate dimensions of these\r\nfeatures, so far as the facts of the distribution of the stars and the\r\nviews of those astronomers who have paid most attention to the subject can\r\nbe harmonised. Of course it is not suggested that the whole arrangement is\r\nso regular as here shown, but an attempt has been made by means of the\r\ndotted shading to represent the comparative densities of the different\r\nportions of space around us, and a few remarks on this point may be needed.\r\n\r\nThe solar cluster is shown very dense at the central portion, occupying\r\none-tenth of its diameter, and it is near the outside of this dense centre\r\nthat our sun is supposed to be situated. Beyond this there seems to be\r\nalmost a vacuity, beyond which again is the outer portion of the cluster\r\nconsisting of comparatively thinly scattered stars, thus forming a kind of\r\nring-cluster, resembling in shape the beautiful ring-nebula in Lyra, as has\r\nbeen suggested by several astronomers. There is some direct evidence for\r\nthis ring-form. Professor Newcomb in his recent book on _The Stars_ gives\r\na list of all stars of which the parallax is fairly well known. These are\r\nsixty-nine in number; and on arranging them in the order of the amount of\r\ntheir parallax, I find that no less than thirty-five of them have\r\nparallaxes between 0\".1 and 0\".4 of a second, thus showing that they\r\nconstitute part of the dense central mass; while three others, from 0\".4 to\r\n0\".75, indicate those which are our closest companions at the present time,\r\nbut still at an enormous distance. Those which have parallaxes of less than\r\nthe tenth and down to one-hundredth of a second are only thirty-one in all;\r\nbut as they are spread over a sphere ten times the diameter, and therefore\r\na thousand times the cubic content of the sphere containing those above\r\none-tenth of a second, they ought to be immensely more numerous even if\r\nvery much more thinly scattered. The interesting point, however, is, that\r\ntill we get down to a parallax of 0\".06, there are only three stars as yet\r\nmeasured, whereas those between 0\".02 and 0\".06, an equal range of\r\nparallax, are twenty-six in number, and as these are scattered in all\r\ndirections they indicate an almost vacant space followed by a moderately\r\ndense outer ring.\r\n\r\nIn the enormous space between our cluster and the Milky Way, and also above\r\nand below its plane to the poles of the Galaxy, stars appear to be very\r\nthinly scattered, perhaps more densely in the plane of the Milky Way than\r\nabove and below it where the irresolvable nebulæ are so numerous; and there\r\nmay not improbably be an almost vacant space beyond our cluster for a\r\nconsiderable distance, as has been supposed, but this cannot be known till\r\nsome means are discovered of measuring parallaxes of from one-hundredth to\r\none five-hundredth of a second.\r\n\r\nThese diagrams also serve to indicate another point of considerable\r\nimportance to the view here advocated. By placing the solar system towards\r\nthe outer margin of the dense central portion of the solar cluster (which\r\nmay very possibly include a large proportion of dark stars and thus be much\r\nmore dense towards the centre than it appears to us), it may very well be\r\nsupposed to revolve, with the other stars composing it, around the centre\r\nof gravity of the cluster, as the force of gravity towards that centre\r\nmight be perhaps twenty or a hundred times greater than towards the very\r\nmuch less dense and more remote outer portions of the cluster. The sun, as\r\nindicated on the diagrams, is about thirty light-years from that centre,\r\ncorresponding to a parallax of a little more than one-tenth of a second,\r\nand an actual distance of 190 millions of millions of miles, equal to about\r\n70,000 times the distance of the sun from Neptune. Yet we see that this\r\nposition is so little removed from the exact centre of the whole stellar\r\nuniverse, that if any beneficial influences are due to that central\r\nposition in regard to the Galaxy, it will receive them perhaps to as full\r\nan extent as if situated at the actual centre. But if it is situated as\r\nhere shown, there is no further difficulty as to its proper motion carrying\r\nit from one side to the other of the Milky Way in less time than has been\r\nrequired for the development of life upon the earth. And if the solar\r\ncluster is really sub-globular, and sufficiently condensed to serve as a\r\ncentre of gravity for the whole of the stars of the cluster to revolve\r\naround, all the component stars which are not situated in the plane of its\r\nequator (and that of the Milky Way) must revolve obliquely at various\r\nangles up to an angle of 90°. These numerous diverging motions, together\r\nwith the motions of the nearer stars outside the cluster, some of which may\r\nrevolve round other centres of gravity made up largely of dark bodies,\r\nwould perhaps sufficiently account for the apparent random motions of so\r\nmany of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIFORM HEAT-SUPPLY DUE TO CENTRAL POSITION\r\n\r\nWe now come to a point of the greatest interest as regards the problem we\r\nare investigating. We have seen how great is the difference in the\r\nestimates of geologists and those of physicists as to the time that has\r\nelapsed during the whole development of life. But the position we have now\r\nfound for the sun, in the outer portion of the central star-cluster, may\r\nafford a clue to this problem. What we require is, some mode of keeping up\r\nthe sun's heat during the enormous geological periods in which we have\r\nevidence of a wonderful uniformity in the earth's temperature, and\r\ntherefore in the sun's heat-emission. The great central ring-cluster with\r\nits condensed central mass, which presumably has been forming for a much\r\nlonger period than our sun has been giving heat to the earth, must during\r\nall this time have been exerting a powerful attraction on the diffused\r\nmatter in the spaces around it, now apparently almost void as compared with\r\nwhat they may have been. Some scanty remnants of that matter we see in the\r\nnumerous meteoric swarms which have been drawn into our system. A position\r\ntowards the outside of this central aggregation of suns would evidently be\r\nvery favourable for the growth by accretion of any considerable mass. The\r\nenormous distance apart of the outer components (the outer ring) of the\r\ncluster would allow a large amount of the inflowing meteoritic matter to\r\nescape them, and the larger suns situated near the surface of the inner\r\ndense cluster would draw to themselves the greater part of this matter.[23]\r\nThe various planets of our system were no doubt built up from a portion of\r\nthe matter that flowed in near the plane of the ecliptic, but much of that\r\nwhich came from all other directions would be drawn towards the sun itself\r\nor to its neighbouring suns. Some of this would fall directly into it;\r\nother masses coming from different directions and colliding with each other\r\nwould have their motion checked, and thus again fall into the sun; and so\r\nlong as the matter falling in were not in too large masses, the slow\r\nadditions to the sun's bulk and increase of its heat would be sufficiently\r\ngradual to be in no way prejudicial to a planet at the earth's distance.\r\n\r\nThe main point I wish to suggest here is, that by far the greater portion\r\nof the matter of the whole stellar universe has, either through gravitation\r\nor in combination with electrical forces, as suggested by Mr. Whittaker,\r\nbecome drawn together into the vast ring-formed system of the Milky Way,\r\nwhich is, presumably, slowly revolving, and has thus been checked in its\r\noriginal inflow toward the centre of mass of the stellar universe. It has\r\nalso probably drawn towards itself the adjacent portions of the scattered\r\nmaterial in the spaces around it in all directions.\r\n\r\nHad the vast mass of matter postulated by Lord Kelvin acquired no motion of\r\nrevolution, but have fallen continuously towards the centre of mass, the\r\nmotions developed when the more distant bodies approached that centre would\r\nhave been extremely rapid; while, as they must have fallen in from every\r\ndirection, they would have become more and more densely aggregated, and\r\ncollisions of the most catastrophic nature would frequently have occurred,\r\nand this would have rendered the central portion of the universe the\r\n_least_ stable and the _least_ fitted to develop life.\r\n\r\nBut, under the conditions that actually prevail, the very reverse is the\r\ncase. The quantity of matter remaining between our cluster and the Milky\r\nWay being comparatively small, the aggregation into suns has gone on more\r\nregularly and more slowly. The motions acquired by our sun and its\r\nneighbours have been rendered moderate by two causes: (1) their nearness to\r\nthe centre of the very slowly aggregating cluster where the motion due to\r\ngravitation is least in amount; and (2) the slight differential attraction\r\naway from the centre by the Milky Way on the side nearest to us. Again,\r\nthis protective action of the Milky Way has been repeated, on a smaller\r\nscale, by the formation of the outer ring of the solar cluster, which has\r\nthus preserved the inner central cluster itself from a too abundant direct\r\ninflow of large masses of matter.\r\n\r\nBut although the matter composing the outer portion of the original\r\nuniverse has been to a large extent aggregated into the vast system of the\r\nMilky Way, it seems probable, perhaps even certain, that some portion would\r\nescape its attractive forces and would pass through its numerous open\r\nspaces--indicated by the dark rifts, channels, and patches, as already\r\ndescribed--and thus flow on unchecked towards the centre of mass of the\r\nwhole system. The quantity of matter thus reaching the central cluster from\r\nthe enormously remote spaces beyond the Milky Way might be very small in\r\ncomparison with what was retained to build up that wonderful star-system;\r\nbut it might yet be so large in total amount as to play an important part\r\nin the formation of the central group of suns. It would probably flow\r\ninwards almost continuously, and when it ultimately reached the solar\r\ncluster, it would have attained a very high velocity. If, therefore, it\r\nwere widely diffused, and consisted of masses of small or moderate size as\r\ncompared with planets or stars, it would furnish the energy requisite for\r\nbringing these slowly aggregating stars to the required intensity of heat\r\nfor forming luminous suns.\r\n\r\nHere, then, I think, we have found an adequate explanation of the very\r\nlong-continued light and heat-emitting capacity of our sun, and probably of\r\nmany others in about the same position in the solar cluster. These would at\r\nfirst gradually aggregate into considerable masses from the slowly moving\r\ndiffused matter of the central portions of the original universe; but at a\r\nlater period they would be reinforced by a constant and steady inrush of\r\nmatter from its very outer regions, and therefore possessing such high\r\nvelocities as to materially aid in producing and maintaining the requisite\r\ntemperature of a sun such as ours, during the long periods demanded for\r\ncontinuous life-development. The enormous extension and mass of the\r\noriginal universe of diffused matter (as postulated by Lord Kelvin) is thus\r\nseen to be of the greatest importance as regards this ultimate product of\r\nevolution, because, without it, the comparatively slow-moving and cool\r\ncentral regions might not have been able to produce and maintain the\r\nrequisite energy in the form of heat; while the aggregation of by far the\r\nlarger portion of its matter in the great revolving ring of the galaxy was\r\nequally important, in order to prevent the too great and too rapid inflow\r\nof matter to these favoured regions.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that if we admit as probable some such process of\r\ndevelopment as I have here indicated, we can dimly see the bearing of all\r\nthe great features of the stellar universe upon the successful development\r\nof life. These are, its vast dimensions; the form it has acquired in the\r\nmighty ring of the Milky Way; and our position near to, but not exactly in,\r\nits centre. We know that the star-system _has_ acquired these forms,\r\npresumably from some simple and more diffused condition. We know that we\r\n_are_ situated near the centre of this vast system. We know that our sun\r\n_has_ emitted light and heat, almost uniformly, for periods incompatible\r\nwith rapid aggregation and the equally rapid cooling which physicists\r\nconsider inevitable. I have here suggested a mode of development which\r\nwould lead to a very slow but continuous growth of the more central suns;\r\nto an excessively long period of nearly stationary heat-giving power; and\r\nlastly, an equally long period of very gradual cooling--a period the\r\ncommencement of which our sun may have just entered upon.\r\n\r\nDescending now to terrestrial physics, I have shown that, owing to the\r\nhighly complex nature of the adjustments required to render a world\r\nhabitable and to retain its habitability during the æons of time requisite\r\nfor life-development, it is in the highest degree improbable that the\r\nrequired conditions and adaptations should have occurred in any other\r\nplanets of any other suns, which _might_ occupy an equally favourable\r\nposition with our own, and which were of the requisite size and heat-giving\r\npower.\r\n\r\nLastly, I submit that the whole of the evidence I have here brought\r\ntogether leads to the conclusion that our earth is almost certainly the\r\nonly inhabited planet in our solar system; and, further, that there is no\r\ninconceivability--no improbability even--in the conception that, in order\r\nto produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the\r\norderly development of organic life culminating in man, such a vast and\r\ncomplex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been\r\nabsolutely required.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\r\n\r\nAs the last ten chapters of this volume embody a connected argument leading\r\nto the conclusion above stated, it may be useful to my readers to summarise\r\nrather fully the successive steps of this argument, the facts on which it\r\nrests, and the various subsidiary conclusions arrived at.\r\n\r\n(1) One of the most important results of modern astronomy is to have\r\nestablished the unity of the vast stellar universe which we see around us.\r\nThis rests upon a great mass of observations, which demonstrate the\r\nwonderful complexity in detail of the arrangement and distribution of stars\r\nand nebulæ, combined with a no less remarkable general symmetry, indicating\r\nthroughout a single inter-dependent system, not a number of totally\r\ndistinct systems so far apart as to have no physical relations with each\r\nother, as was once supposed.\r\n\r\n(2) This view is supported by numerous converging lines of evidence, all\r\ntending to show that the stars are not infinite in number, as was once\r\ngenerally believed, and which view is even now advocated by some\r\nastronomers. The very remarkable calculations of Lord Kelvin, referred to\r\nin the early part of this chapter, give a further support to this view,\r\nsince they show that if the stars extended much beyond those we see or can\r\nobtain direct knowledge of, and with no very great change in their average\r\ndistance apart, then the force of gravitation towards the centre would have\r\nproduced on the average more rapid motions than the stars generally\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n(3) An overwhelming consensus of opinion among the best astronomers\r\nestablishes the fact of our nearly central position in the stellar\r\nuniverse. They all agree that the Milky Way is nearly circular in form.\r\nThey all agree that our sun is situated almost exactly in its medial plane.\r\nThey all agree that our sun, although not situated at the exact centre of\r\nthe galactic circle, is yet not very far from it, because there are no\r\nunmistakable signs of our being nearer to it at any one point and farther\r\naway from the opposite point. Thus the nearly central position of our sun\r\nin the great star-system is almost universally admitted.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the solar-cluster there is more difference of opinion;\r\nthough here, again, all are agreed that there is such a cluster. Its size,\r\nform, density, and exact position are somewhat uncertain, but I have, as\r\nfar as possible, been guided by the best available evidence. If we adopt\r\nLord Kelvin's general idea of the gradual condensation of an enormous\r\ndiffused mass of matter towards its common centre of gravity, that centre\r\nwould be approximately the centre of this cluster. Also, as gravitational\r\nforce at and near this centre would be comparatively small, the motions\r\nproduced there would be slow, and collisions, being due only to\r\ndifferential motions, when they did occur would be very gentle. We might\r\ntherefore expect many dark aggregations of matter here, which may explain\r\nwhy we do not find any special crowding of visible stars in the direction\r\nof this centre; while, as no star has a sensible disc, the dark stars if at\r\ngreat distances would hardly ever be seen to occult the bright ones. Thus,\r\nit seems to me, the controlling force may be explained which has retained\r\nour sun in approximately the same orbit around the centre of gravity of\r\nthis central cluster during the whole period of its existence as a sun and\r\nour existence as a planet; and has thus saved us from the\r\npossibility--perhaps even the certainty--of disastrous collisions or\r\ndisruptive approaches to which suns, in or near the Milky Way, and to a\r\nless extent elsewhere, are or have been exposed. It seems quite probable\r\nthat in that region of more rapid and less controlled motions and more\r\ncrowded masses of matter, no star can remain in a nearly stable condition\r\nas regards temperature for sufficiently long periods to allow of a complete\r\nsystem of life-development on any planet it may possess.\r\n\r\n(4) The various proofs are next stated that assure us of the almost\r\ncomplete uniformity of matter, and of material physical and chemical laws,\r\nthroughout our universe. This I believe no one seriously disputes; and it\r\nis a point of the greatest importance when we come to consider the\r\nconditions required for the development and maintenance of life, since it\r\nassures us that very similar, if not identical, conditions must prevail\r\nwherever organic life is or can be developed.\r\n\r\n(5) This leads us on to the consideration of the essential characteristics\r\nof the living organism, consisting as it does of some of the most abundant\r\nand most widely distributed of these material elements, and being always\r\nsubject to the general laws of matter. The best authorities in physiology\r\nare quoted, as to the extreme complexity of the chemical compounds which\r\nconstitute the physical basis for the manifestation of life; as to their\r\ngreat instability; their wonderful mobility combined with permanence of\r\nform and structure; and the altogether marvellous powers they possess of\r\nbringing about unique chemical transformations and of building up the most\r\ncomplicated structures from simple elements.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to put the broad phenomena of vegetable and animal life\r\nin a way that will enable my readers to form some faint conception of the\r\nintricacy, the delicacy, and the mystery of the myriad living forms they\r\nsee everywhere around them. Such a conception will enable them to realise\r\nhow supremely grand is organic life, and to appreciate better, perhaps, the\r\nabsolute necessity for the numerous, complex and delicate adaptations of\r\ninorganic nature, without which it is impossible for life either to exist\r\nnow, or to have been developed during the immeasurable past.\r\n\r\n(6) The general conditions which are absolutely essential for life thus\r\nmanifested on our planet are then discussed, such as, solar light and heat;\r\nwater universally distributed on the planet's surface and in the\r\natmosphere; an atmosphere of sufficient density, and composed of the\r\nseveral gases from which alone protoplasm can be formed; some alternations\r\nof light and darkness, and a few others.\r\n\r\n(7) Having treated these conditions broadly, and explained why they are\r\nimportant and even indispensable for life, we next proceed to show how they\r\nare fulfilled upon the earth, and how numerous, how complex, and often how\r\nexact are the adjustments needed to bring them about, and maintain them\r\nalmost unchanged throughout the vast æons of time occupied in the\r\ndevelopment of life. Two chapters are devoted to this subject; and it is\r\nbelieved that they contain facts that will be new to many of my readers.\r\nThe combinations of causes which lead to this result are so varied, and in\r\nseveral cases dependent on such exceptional peculiarities of physical\r\nconstitution, that it seems in the highest degree improbable that they can\r\n_all_ be found again combined either in the solar system or even in the\r\nstellar universe. It will be well here just to enumerate these conditions,\r\nwhich are all essential within more or less narrow limits:--\r\n\r\n     Distance of planet from the sun.\r\n\r\n     Mass of planet.\r\n\r\n     Obliquity of its ecliptic.\r\n\r\n     Amount of water as compared with land.\r\n\r\n     Surface distribution of land and water.\r\n\r\n     Permanence of this distribution, dependent probably on the\r\n     unique origin of our moon.\r\n\r\n     An atmosphere of sufficient density, and of suitable component\r\n     gases.\r\n\r\n     An adequate amount of dust in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     Atmospheric electricity.\r\n\r\nMany of these act and react on each other, and lead to results of great\r\ncomplexity.\r\n\r\n(8) Passing on to other planets of the solar system, it is shown that none\r\nof them combine all the complex conditions which are found to work\r\nharmoniously together on the earth; while in most cases there is some one\r\ndefect which alone removes them from the category of possible\r\nlife-producing and life-supporting planets. Among these are the small size\r\nand mass of Mars, being such that it cannot retain aqueous vapour; and the\r\nfact that Venus rotates on its axis in the same time as it takes to revolve\r\nround the sun. Neither of these facts was known when Proctor wrote upon the\r\nquestion of the habitability of the planets. All the other planets are now\r\ngiven up--and were given up by Proctor himself--as possible life-bearers in\r\ntheir present stage; but he and others have held that, if not suitable now,\r\nsome of them may have been the scene of life-development in the past,\r\nwhile others will be so in the future.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the futility of this supposition, the problem of the\r\nduration of the sun as a stable heat-giver is discussed; and it is shown\r\nthat it is only by reducing the periods claimed by geologists and\r\nbiologists for life-development upon the earth, and by extending the time\r\nallowed by physicists to its utmost limits, that the two claims can be\r\nharmonised. It follows that the whole period of the sun's duration as a\r\nlight and heat-giver has been required for the development of life upon the\r\nearth; and that it is only upon planets whose phases of development\r\nsynchronise with that of the earth that the evolution of life is possible.\r\nFor those whose material evolution has gone on quicker or slower, there has\r\nnot been, or will not be, time enough for the development of life.\r\n\r\n(9) The problem of the stars as possibly having life-supporting planets is\r\nnext dealt with, and reasons are given why in only a minute portion of the\r\nwhole is this possible. Even in that minute portion, reduced probably to a\r\nfew of the component suns of the solar-cluster, a large proportion seems\r\nlikely to be ruled out by being close binary systems, and another large\r\nportion by being in process of aggregation. In those remaining, whether\r\nthey may be reckoned by tens or by hundreds we cannot say, the chances\r\nagainst the same complex combination of conditions as those which we find\r\non the earth occurring on any planet of any other sun are enormously great.\r\n\r\n(10) I then refer, briefly, to some recent measurements of star-radiation,\r\nand suggest that they may thus possibly have important effects on the\r\ndevelopment of vegetable and animal life; and, finally, I discuss the\r\nproblem of the stability of the stellar universe and the special advantage\r\nwe derive from our central position, suggested by some of the latest\r\nresearches of our great mathematician and physicist--Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nHaving thus brought together the whole of the available evidence bearing\r\nupon the questions treated in this volume, I claim that certain definite\r\nconclusions have been reached and proved, and that certain other\r\nconclusions have enormous probabilities in their favour.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions reached by modern astronomers are: (1) That the stellar\r\nuniverse forms one connected whole; and, though of enormous extent, is yet\r\nfinite, and its extent determinable.\r\n\r\n(2) That the solar system is situated in the plane of the Milky Way, and\r\nnot far removed from the centre of that plane. The earth is therefore\r\nnearly in the centre of the stellar universe.\r\n\r\n(3) That this universe consists throughout of the same kinds of matter, and\r\nis subjected to the same physical and chemical laws.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which I claim to have shown to have enormous probabilities\r\nin their favour are--\r\n\r\n(4) That no other planet in the solar system than our earth is inhabited or\r\nhabitable.\r\n\r\n(5) That the probabilities are almost as great against any other sun\r\npossessing inhabited planets.\r\n\r\n(6) That the nearly central position of our sun is probably a permanent\r\none, and has been specially favourable, perhaps absolutely essential, to\r\nlife-development on the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese latter conclusions depend upon the combination of a large number of\r\nspecial conditions, each of which must be in definite relation to many of\r\nthe others, and must all have persisted simultaneously during enormous\r\nperiods of time. The weight to be given to this kind of reasoning depends\r\nupon a full and fair consideration of the _whole_ evidence as I have\r\nendeavoured to present it in the last seven chapters of this book. To this\r\nevidence I appeal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis completes my work as a connected argument, founded wholly on the facts\r\nand principles accumulated by modern science; and it leads, if my facts are\r\nsubstantially correct and my reasoning sound, to one great and definite\r\nconclusion--that man, the culmination of conscious organic life, has been\r\ndeveloped here only in the whole vast material universe we see around us. I\r\nclaim that this is the logical outcome of the evidence, if we consider and\r\nweigh this evidence without any prepossessions whatever. I maintain that it\r\nis a question as to which we have no right to form _a priori_ opinions not\r\nfounded upon evidence. And evidence opposed to this conclusion, or even as\r\nto its improbability, we have absolutely none whatever.\r\n\r\nBut, if we admit the conclusion, nothing that need alarm either the\r\nscientific or the religious mind necessarily follows, because it can be\r\nexplained or accounted for in either of two distinct ways. One\r\nconsiderable body, including probably the majority of men of science, will\r\nadmit that the evidence does apparently lead to this conclusion, but will\r\nexplain it as due to a fortunate coincidence. There might have been a\r\nhundred or a thousand life-bearing planets, had the course of evolution of\r\nthe universe been a little different, or there might have been none at all.\r\nThey would probably add, that, as life and man _have_ been produced, that\r\nshows that their production was possible; and therefore, if not now then at\r\nsome other time, if not here then in some other planet of some other sun,\r\nwe should be sure to have come into existence; or if not precisely the same\r\nas we are, then something a little better or a little worse.\r\n\r\nThe other body, and probably much the largest, would be represented by\r\nthose who, holding that mind is essentially superior to matter and distinct\r\nfrom it, cannot believe that life, consciousness, mind, are products of\r\nmatter. They hold that the marvellous complexity of forces which appear to\r\ncontrol matter, if not actually to constitute it, are and must be\r\nmind-products; and when they see life and mind apparently rising out of\r\nmatter and giving to its myriad forms an added complexity and unfathomable\r\nmystery, they see in this development an additional proof of the supremacy\r\nof mind. Such persons would be inclined to the belief of the great\r\neighteenth century scholar, Dr. Bentley, that the soul of one virtuous man\r\nis of greater worth and excellency than the sun and all his planets and all\r\nthe stars in the heavens; and when they are shown that there are strong\r\nreasons for thinking that man _is_ the unique and supreme product of this\r\nvast universe, they will see no difficulty in going a little further, and\r\nbelieving that the universe was actually brought into existence for this\r\nvery purpose.\r\n\r\nWith infinite space around us and infinite time before and behind us, there\r\nis no incongruity in this conception. A universe as large as ours for the\r\npurpose of bringing into existence many myriads of living, intellectual,\r\nmoral, and spiritual beings, with unlimited possibilities of life and\r\nhappiness, is surely not _more_ out of proportion than is the complex\r\nmachinery, the life-long labour, the ingenuity and invention which we have\r\nbestowed upon the production of the humble, the trivial, _pin_. Neither is\r\nthe apparent waste of energy so great in such a universe, comparatively, as\r\nthe millions of acorns, produced during its life by an oak, every one of\r\nwhich might grow to be a tree, but of which only _one_ does actually, after\r\nseveral hundred years, produce the _one_ tree which is to replace the\r\nparent. And if it is said that the acorns are food for bird and beast, yet\r\nthe spores of ferns and the seeds of orchids are not so, and countless\r\nmillions of these go to waste for every one which reproduces the parent\r\nform. And all through the animal world, especially among the lower types,\r\nthe same thing is seen. For the great majority of these entities _we_ can\r\nsee no use whatever, either of the enormous variety of the species, or the\r\nvast hordes of individuals. Of beetles alone there are at least a hundred\r\nthousand distinct species now living, while in some parts of sub-arctic\r\nAmerica mosquitoes are sometimes so excessively abundant that they obscure\r\nthe sun. And when we think of the myriads that have existed through the\r\nvast ages of geological time, the mind reels under the immensity of, to\r\nus, apparently useless life.\r\n\r\nAll nature tells us the same strange, mysterious story, of the exuberance\r\nof life, of endless variety, of unimaginable quantity. All this life upon\r\nour earth has led up to and culminated in that of man. It has been, I\r\nbelieve, a common and not unpopular idea that during the whole process of\r\nthe rise and growth and extinction of past forms, the earth has been\r\npreparing for the ultimate--Man. Much of the wealth and luxuriance of\r\nliving things, the infinite variety of form and structure, the exquisite\r\ngrace and beauty in bird and insect, in foliage and flower, may have been\r\nmere by-products of the grand mechanism we call nature--the one and only\r\nmethod of developing humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd is it not in perfect harmony with this grandeur of design (if it be\r\ndesign), this vastness of scale, this marvellous process of development\r\nthrough all the ages, that the material universe needed to produce this\r\ncradle of organic life, and of a being destined to a higher and a permanent\r\nexistence, should be on a corresponding scale of vastness, of complexity,\r\nof beauty? Even if there were no such evidence as I have here adduced for\r\nthe unique position and the exceptional characteristics which distinguish\r\nthe earth, the old idea that all the planets were inhabited, and that all\r\nthe stars existed for the sake of other planets, which planets existed to\r\ndevelop life, would, in the light of our present knowledge, seem utterly\r\nimprobable and incredible. It would introduce monotony into a universe\r\nwhose grand character and teaching is endless diversity. It would imply\r\nthat to produce the living soul in the marvellous and glorious body of\r\nman--man with his faculties, his aspirations, his powers for good and\r\nevil--that this was an easy matter which could be brought about anywhere,\r\nin any world. It would imply that man is an animal and nothing more, is of\r\nno importance in the universe, needed no great preparations for his advent,\r\nonly, perhaps, a second-rate demon, and a third or fourth-rate earth.\r\nLooking at the long and slow and complex growth of nature that preceded his\r\nappearance, the immensity of the stellar universe with its thousand million\r\nsuns, and the vast æons of time during which it has been developing--all\r\nthese seem only the appropriate and harmonious surroundings, the necessary\r\nsupply of material, the sufficiently spacious workshop for the production\r\nof that planet which was to produce first, the organic world, and then,\r\nMan.\r\n\r\nIn one of his finest passages our great world-poet gives us _his_\r\nconception of the grandeur of human nature--'What a piece of work is man!\r\nHow noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! In form and moving, how\r\nexpress and admirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how\r\nlike a god!' And for the development of such a being what is a universe\r\nsuch as ours? However vast it may seem to our faculties, it is as a mere\r\nnothing in the ocean of the infinite. In infinite space there may be\r\ninfinite universes, but I hardly think they would be all universes of\r\nmatter. That would indeed be a low conception of infinite power! Here, on\r\nearth, we see millions of distinct species of animals, millions of\r\ndifferent species of plants, and each and every species consisting often\r\nof many millions of individuals, no two individuals exactly alike; and when\r\nwe turn to the heavens, no two planets, no two satellites alike; and\r\noutside our system we see the same law prevailing--no two stars, no two\r\nclusters, no two nebulæ alike. Why then should there be other universes of\r\nthe _same_ matter and subject to the _same_ laws--as is implied by the\r\nconception that the stars are infinite in number, and extend through\r\ninfinite space?\r\n\r\nOf course there may be, and probably are, other universes, perhaps of other\r\nkinds of matter and subject to other laws, perhaps more like our\r\nconceptions of the ether, perhaps wholly non-material, and what we can only\r\nconceive of as spiritual. But, unless these universes, even though each of\r\nthem were a million times vaster than our stellar universe, were also\r\ninfinite in number, they could not fill infinite space, which would extend\r\non all sides beyond them, so that even a million million such universes\r\nwould shrink to imperceptibility when compared with the vast beyond!\r\n\r\nOf infinity in any of its aspects we can really know nothing, but that it\r\nexists and is inconceivable. It is a thought that oppresses and overwhelms.\r\nYet many speak of it glibly as if they _knew_ what it contains, and even\r\nuse that assumed knowledge as an argument against views that are\r\nunacceptable to themselves. To me its existence is absolute but\r\nunthinkable--that way madness lies.\r\n\r\n    'O night! O stars, too rudely jars\r\n    The finite with the infinite!'\r\n\r\nI will conclude with one of the finest passages relating to the infinite\r\nthat I am acquainted with, from the pen of the late R.A. Proctor:\r\n\r\n'Inconceivable, doubtless, are these infinities of time and space, of\r\nmatter, of motion, and of life. Inconceivable that the whole universe can\r\nbe for all time the scene of the operation of infinite power, omnipresent,\r\nall-knowing. Utterly incomprehensible how Infinite Purpose can be\r\nassociated with endless material evolution. But it is no new thought, no\r\nmodern discovery, that we are thus utterly powerless to conceive or\r\ncomprehend the idea of an Infinite Being, Almighty, All-knowing,\r\nOmnipresent, and Eternal, of whose inscrutable purpose the material\r\nuniverse is the unexplained manifestation. Science is in presence of the\r\nold, old mystery; the old, old questions are asked of her--\"Canst thou by\r\nsearching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\r\nIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst\r\nthou know?\" And science answers these questions as they were answered of\r\nold--\"As touching the Almighty we cannot find Him out.\"'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following beautiful lines--among the latest products of Tennyson's\r\ngenius--so completely harmonise with the subject-matter of the present\r\nvolume, that no apology is needed for quoting them here:--\r\n\r\n(_The Question_)\r\n\r\n    Will my tiny spark of being\r\n      Wholly vanish in your deeps and heights?\r\n    Must my day be dark by reason,\r\n      O ye Heavens, of your boundless nights,\r\n    Rush of Suns and roll of systems,\r\n      And your fiery clash of meteorites?\r\n\r\n(_The Answer_)\r\n\r\n    'Spirit, nearing yon dark portal\r\n      At the limit of thy human state,\r\n    Fear not thou the hidden purpose\r\n      Of that Power which alone is great,\r\n    Nor the myriad world, His shadow,\r\n      Nor the silent Opener of the Gate.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[23] Since writing this chapter I have seen a paper by Luigi d'Auria\r\ndealing mathematically with 'Stellar Motion, etc.,' and am pleased to see\r\nthat, from quite different considerations, he has found it necessary to\r\nplace the solar system at a distance from the centre not very much more\r\nremote than the position I have given it. He says: 'We have good reasons to\r\nsuppose that the solar system is rather near the centre of the Milky Way,\r\nand as this centre would, according to our hypothesis, coincide with the\r\ncentre of the Universe, the distance of 159 light years assumed is not too\r\ngreat, nor can it be very much smaller.'--_Journal of the Franklin\r\nInstitute_, March 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Adrianus Tollius on stone axes, 203.\r\n\r\n    Air criminally poisoned by us, 260.\r\n\r\n    Albedo explained, 162.\r\n\r\n    Algol and its companion, 39;\r\n      change of colour of, 41.\r\n\r\n    Allen, Prof. F.J., on living matter, 193;\r\n      on importance of nitrogen, 195;\r\n      on physical conditions essential for life, 196.\r\n\r\n    Alpha Centauri, nearest star, 74.\r\n\r\n    Ammonia, importance of, to life, 195.\r\n\r\n    Anaximander's cosmic theory, 2.\r\n\r\n    Angles of a minute and second, 80.\r\n\r\n    Arcturus, rapid motion of, 172.\r\n\r\n    Argument of book, summary of, 310.\r\n\r\n    Astronomers, the first, 2.\r\n\r\n    Astronomy, the new, 24.\r\n\r\n    Astrophysics, a new science, 32.\r\n\r\n    Atmosphere, qualities requisite for life, 210;\r\n      requisite composition of, 212;\r\n      aqueous vapour in, 214;\r\n      and life, 243;\r\n      effects of density of, 245;\r\n      a complex structure, 259;\r\n      its vital importance to us, 260.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ball, Sir R., on dark stars, 143;\r\n      _Time and Tide_, 233.\r\n\r\n    Barnham, S.W., on double stars, 123.\r\n\r\n    Blue of sky due to dust, 251.\r\n\r\n    Boeddicker's map of Milky Way, 164.\r\n\r\n    Brewster, Sir D., against Whewell, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Campbell, Prof., on spectroscopic binaries, 125;\r\n      on uncertainty of sun's motions, 179;\r\n      on number of binary systems, 286.\r\n\r\n    Carbon compounds, vast numbers of, 194.\r\n\r\n    Carbonic acid gas essential for life, 196.\r\n\r\n    Central position of sun, importance of, 305.\r\n\r\n    Chaldeans the first astronomers, 2.\r\n\r\n    Chalmers Dr., on plurality of worlds, 13.\r\n\r\n    Chamberlin, T.C., origin of nebulæ, 120;\r\n      on stellar disruption, 186.\r\n\r\n    Chromosphere, the sun's, 107.\r\n\r\n    Clerke, Miss A.M., on limits of star system, 138;\r\n      on Milky Way, 158, 160;\r\n      on solar cluster, 165;\r\n      on uncertainty of the sun's motion, 177.\r\n\r\n    Climate, persistence of mild, 222.\r\n\r\n    Clouds, importance of, to life, 248.\r\n\r\n    Clusters in relation to Galaxy, 67.\r\n\r\n    Comte, on impossibility of real knowledge of the stars, 25.\r\n\r\n    Conclusions of the book, 317;\r\n      bearing of, on science and on religion, 319.\r\n\r\n    Corona of sun, 108.\r\n\r\n    Criticisms of article in _Fortnightly Review_, 168, 180.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Darwin, Prof. G., on meteoritic hypothesis, 133;\r\n      on origin of moon, 233;\r\n      on instability of annular systems, 295.\r\n\r\n    Day and night, uses of, 215.\r\n\r\n    Diagrams of star-distribution, 62, 66.\r\n\r\n    Diffraction-gratings, 30.\r\n\r\n    Disruption of stellar bodies, 187.\r\n\r\n    Doppler principle, the, 37.\r\n\r\n    Double stars, evolution of, 123;\r\n      not fitted for life, 286.\r\n\r\n    Dust, importance of, 249.\r\n\r\n    Dust-free air, results of, 254.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Earth, first measured, 5;\r\n      in relation to life, 218;\r\n      the only habitable planet, 262;\r\n      cannot retain hydrogen, 264;\r\n      supposed extreme conditions of, 271.\r\n\r\n    Earth's mass, how related to life, 265.\r\n\r\n    Ecliptic, obliquity of, in relation to life, 219.\r\n\r\n    Electricity, effects of atmospheric, 257;\r\n      atmospheric, how caused, 258.\r\n\r\n    Elements, change in spectra of, 129;\r\n      in the sun, 184;\r\n      in meteorites, 185;\r\n      in organic structures, 201.\r\n\r\n    Empedocles an early astronomer, 3.\r\n\r\n    Eudoxus on motions of planets, 3.\r\n\r\n    Evolution of the stars, 128.\r\n\r\n    Explanations of life-processes, 202.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Faculæ of sun, 105.\r\n\r\n    Fisher, Rev.
