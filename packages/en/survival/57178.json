Both are in the closest touch with nature and,\r\ntherefore, full of interest. The one is as full of adventure, excitement\r\nand depression, hope and failure, as the other, yet there is ever the\r\ngreat difference that the hunter of live game, thorough sportsman though\r\nhe may be, is always bringing live animals nearer to death and\r\nextinction, whereas the fossil hunter is always seeking to bring extinct\r\nanimals back to life. This revivification of the past, of the forms\r\nwhich once graced the forests and plains, and rivers and seas, is\r\nattended with as great fascination as the quest of live game, and to my\r\nmind is a still more honorable and noble pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe richness of the great American fossil fields, which extend over the\r\nvast arid and semi-arid area of the West, scattered over both the great\r\nplains region and the great mountain region, has resulted in the\r\ncreation of a distinctively American profession: that of fossil hunting.\r\nThe fossil hunter must first of all be a scientific enthusiast. He must\r\nbe willing to endure all kinds of hardships, to suffer cold in the early\r\nspring and the late autumn and early winter months, to suffer intense\r\nheat and the glare of the sun in summer months, and he must be prepared\r\nto drink alkali water, and in some regions to fight off the attack of\r\nthe mosquito and other pests. He must be something of an engineer in\r\norder to be able to handle large masses of stone and transport them over\r\nroadless wastes of desert to the nearest shipping point; he must have a\r\ndelicate and skilful touch to preserve the least fragments of bone when\r\nfractured; he must be content with very plain living, because the\r\nprofession is seldom, if ever, remunerative, and he is almost invariably\r\nunderpaid; he must find his chief reward and stimulus in the sense of\r\ndiscovery and in the despatching of specimens to museums which he has\r\nnever seen for the benefit of a public which has little knowledge or\r\nappreciation of the self-sacrifices which the fossil hunter has made.\r\n\r\nThe fossil fields of America have fortunately attracted a number of such\r\ndevoted explorers, and one of the pioneers on the honorable list is the\r\nauthor of this work, who by his untiring energy has contributed some of\r\nthe finest specimens which now adorn the shelves and cases of many of\r\nthe great museums of America and Europe.\r\n\r\nAlthough special explorations have been described, sometimes in\r\nconsiderable detail, this is the first time that the “life of a fossil\r\nhunter” has been written, and it is fitting that it comes from the pen\r\nof the oldest living representative of this distinctively American\r\nprofession. The name of Charles H. Sternberg is attached to discoveries\r\nin many parts of the West; discoveries which have formed distinct\r\ncontributions to science, to the advance of paleontology, to our\r\nknowledge of the wonderful ancient life of North America. His is a\r\ncareer full of adventure, of self-sacrifice, worthy of lasting record\r\nand recognition by all lovers of nature.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LIFE OF A FOSSIL HUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n       EARLY DAYS AND WORK IN THE DAKOTA GROUP OF THE CRETACEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not remember when I first began collecting fossils, but I have\r\nalways loved nature.\r\n\r\nFifteen years of my early life were spent in Otsego County, New York, at\r\ndear old Hartwick Seminary, where my father, the Rev. Dr. Levi\r\nSternberg, was principal for fourteen years, and my grandfather, Dr.\r\nGeorge B. Miller, a much-loved, devout man, professor of theology for\r\nthirty-five. The lovely valley of the Susquehanna, in which it stands,\r\nlies five miles below Cooperstown, the birthplace of the Walter Scott of\r\nAmerica, James Fenimore Cooper, and my boyhood was spent among scenes\r\nwhich he has made famous. Often my companions and I have gone picnicking\r\non Otsego Lake, shouting to call up the echo, and spreading our\r\ntablecloth on shore beneath the very tree from which the catamount was\r\nonce about to spring upon terrified Elizabeth Temple.\r\n\r\nMy greatest pleasure in those early days and best, was to live with a\r\ndarling cousin in the woods. There among the majestic trees,—maples,\r\nhickories, pines, and hemlocks,—we used to build sylvan retreats,\r\nweaving willow twigs in and out among the poles which I cut for\r\nsupports; and there, to those great trees, I delivered my boy orations.\r\nWe delighted also to visit and explore Moss Pond, a body of water on top\r\nof the hills across the river, surrounded entirely by sponge moss. We\r\ncould “teeter” across the moss to a log that gave us support, and catch\r\nblind bullheads, or eat our lunch in the cool, dense hemlock woods that\r\nsurrounded the water, where the heavy branches, intertwined like mighty\r\narms, shut away the light, so that even at midday the sun could barely\r\npierce their shadows.\r\n\r\nHow I loved flowers! I carried to my mother the first crocus bloom that\r\nshowed its head above the melting snow, the trailing arbutus, and the\r\ntender foliage of the wintergreen. Later in the season I gathered for\r\nher the yellow cowslip and fragrant water-lily; and when autumn frosts\r\nhad tinged the leaves with crimson and gold I filled her arms with a\r\nglorious wealth of color.\r\n\r\nEven in those early days I used to cut out shells from the limestone\r\nstrata of the region with whatever tools were at hand, but they were\r\nadmired chiefly as examples of the wonderful power of running water to\r\ncarve rocks into the semblance of shells. Or if one of the more\r\nobservant remarked that these shells looked very much as if they had\r\nbeen alive once, the only theory that would account for their presence\r\nand yet sustain the belief that the world was only six thousand years\r\nold, was that the Almighty, who created the rocks, could easily, at the\r\nsame time, have created the ancient plants and animals as fossils, just\r\nas they were found.\r\n\r\nI remember a rich find I made in the garret of an uncle in Ames, New\r\nYork,—a cradle filled with fossil shells and crystals of quartz. They\r\nhad been collected by my uncle’s brother, who, fortunately, as my uncle\r\nsaid, had died early, before bringing disgrace upon the family by\r\nwasting his time wandering over the hills and gathering stones. All the\r\nlarge specimens he had collected had been thrown away, and the smaller\r\nones in the old cradle had long been forgotten. I was welcome to all my\r\nuncle’s buggy could carry when he took me home, and I can never forget\r\nthe joy of going over that material again and again, selecting the\r\nspecimens that appealed most to my sense of the beautiful and the\r\nwonderful. I labeled them all “From Uncle James,” and it greatly\r\nastonished a dear aunt of mine, to whom I gave them some years later\r\nwhen we moved West, to find in the collection a lot of baculites,\r\nlabeled “Worms from Uncle James.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was ten years old, I met with an accident from which I have never\r\ncompletely recovered. I remember the wild chase I was making after an\r\nolder boy, over the hay-mows and piles of shocked grain in my father’s\r\nbarn. On the floor below, an old-fashioned thresher, one of the first of\r\nits kind, was making an ear-splitting noise, while outside the two\r\nhorses, hitched to an inclined plane, climbed incessantly, but never\r\nreached the top.\r\n\r\nThe boy climbed a shock of oats on the scaffold in the peak of the barn,\r\nand “Charley-boy,” as my mother called me, following him, slipped\r\nthrough a hole in the top of the ladder which had been covered by the\r\nsettling oats, and fell twenty feet to the floor below. The older boy\r\nclimbed swiftly down and carried me home insensible to my mother.\r\n\r\nOur family physician thought that only a sprain was the result, and\r\nbandaged the injured limb; but, as a matter of fact, the fibula of the\r\nleft leg had been dislocated, so that there was much suffering and a\r\nlittle crippled boy going about among the hills on crutches.\r\n\r\nThe leg never grew quite strong again, and some years later gave me a\r\ngood deal of trouble. In 1872 I was in charge of a ranch in Kansas, and\r\nduring November of that year a great sleet storm covered the whole\r\ncentral part of the state. In order to water my cattle, which were\r\nscattered over a range of several thousand acres on Elm Creek, I was\r\nobliged to follow around small bands of them to their accustomed\r\nwatering-places and cut the ice for them. The water that splashed over\r\nmy clothing froze solid, and the result was that inflammatory rheumatism\r\nsettled in the lame leg. I sat in a leathern chair all winter close to a\r\nboxwood stove, tended by my dear mother, who never left me day or night.\r\n\r\nWhen the inflammation subsided, the knee joint had become ankylosed, and\r\nin order to avoid going on crutches all my life, I lay in the hospital\r\nat Fort Riley for three months, all alone in a great ward, and had the\r\nlimb straightened by a special machine. So skilfully did the army\r\nsurgeon do this work that I threw away crutches and cane, and, although\r\nthe leg has always been stiff, I have since walked thousands of miles\r\namong the fossiliferous beds in the desolate fields of the West.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, when I was fifteen years old, my father accepted the\r\nprincipalship of the Iowa Lutheran College at Albion, Marshall County,\r\nand the broken hill country of my boyhood days was replaced by the\r\nplains and water courses of the Middle West.\r\n\r\nTwo years later my twin brother and I emigrated to an older brother’s\r\nranch in Ellsworth County, Kansas, two and a half miles south of Fort\r\nHarker, now known as Kanopolis. This post was at that time the terminus\r\nof the Kansas Division of the Union Pacific, and almost daily train-load\r\nafter train-load of prairie schooners, drawn by oxen, burros, or mules,\r\npulled out from it over the old Butterfield and Santa Fé trails, the one\r\nleading up the Smoky Hill, the other through the valley of the Arkansas\r\nto Denver and the Southwest.\r\n\r\nIn spring great herds of buffalo followed the tender grass northward,\r\nreturning to the South in the fall; and one bright day my brother and I\r\nstarted out on our first buffalo hunt. Driving a team of Indian ponies\r\nhitched to a light spring wagon, we soon left the few settlements\r\nbehind, and reached the level prairie to the southwest, near old Fort\r\nZaro, a deserted one-company post on the Santa Fé Trail. At this time it\r\nhad been appropriated by a cattleman who had a small herd grazing in the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nWhen within a few miles of this post, we saw a large herd of buffalo\r\nlying down a mile away. It was no easy matter to crawl toward them over\r\nthe plain, pushing myself along without raising my body above the short\r\ngrass, but after strenuous efforts I got within shooting distance\r\nwithout disturbing them, and was resting for a shot, when the rancher\r\nrode through the herd and sent them all off at a lope. Much angered and\r\nalmost tempted to turn my gun on the man, I returned to the wagon, and\r\nwe drove on across country that had been cropped as if by a great herd\r\nof sheep by the thousands of buffalo that had passed that way on their\r\njourney south.\r\n\r\nAnxious to find picketing-ground and water, we reached the Arkansas\r\nRiver, where in a swale covered with grass and willows were paths cut by\r\nthe buffalo. I lay down in one of these, and bringing my gun to my\r\nshoulder, was just drawing bead, when a large animal rushed across my\r\nline of vision at right angles to the trail. I pulled the trigger, and\r\ndown went the brown mass in a heap on the ground.\r\n\r\nSwinging my gun above my head, I rushed forward shouting, “I’ve killed a\r\nbuffalo!”—to find that I had shot a Texas cow. Terrified at the thought\r\nof its owner’s anger, we rushed back to the wagon, and, whipping up the\r\nponies, sped away as if the furies were after us. But cooler second\r\nthoughts led us to the conclusion that the cow had come north with the\r\nbuffalo, and was as much our prey as the buffalo themselves.\r\n\r\nJust before sunset we reached a part of the country through which the\r\nbuffalo had not passed, where a rich carpet of grass, covering all the\r\nplain, offered plenty of food for our tired ponies. Here we were\r\ndelighted to find, standing in a ravine, an old bull buffalo, which had\r\nbeen driven out of the herd to die. Concealing ourselves behind the\r\ncarcass of a cow, we opened fire upon him from our Spencer carbines, and\r\ncontinued to riddle his poor old body with leaden slugs until his\r\nstruggles ceased. Even then, when he had lain down to rise no more, we\r\ncrawled up behind him and threw stones at him, to make sure that he was\r\ndead. We found his flesh too tough for food; but it was an exciting\r\nevent to us two boys to kill this massive beast, in earlier days perhaps\r\nthe leader of the herd.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I might tell of a chase I had several years later,\r\nwhile living on a ranch in eastern Ellsworth County. I saw a huge\r\nbuffalo bull come loping along from the hills, headed for a section of\r\nland that was inclosed by a wire fence. On the other side of this\r\nsection there was a piece of timber-land, and fearing that if he got\r\ninto the dense timber I should lose him, I rode after him at the top of\r\nmy speed.\r\n\r\nWhen his lowered head struck the wire fence it flew up like a spring\r\ngate and immediately closed down behind him. In order to follow, I had\r\neither to cut the wire or go out of my way to a gate half a mile to the\r\nsouth. I decided on the latter course, and applied quirt and spur to my\r\nhorse, but upon reaching the gate, discovered my escaping quarry already\r\nhalfway across the section. I got just near enough to put a bullet into\r\nhis rump as he passed through the fence on the other side, and\r\ndisappeared in the dense woods beyond.\r\n\r\nIn my excitement I shouted to my pony, and, dismounting and standing on\r\nthe wire to hold it down, yelled at him to come across. But a sudden fit\r\nof obstinacy had seized him, and he would not come. I had to let the\r\nfence up while I thrashed him, and then as soon as I got it under my\r\nfeet again, he pulled back as before. We repeated this performance until\r\nI was exhausted and gave up the struggle.\r\n\r\nBut upon casting a look of despair in the direction of the vanished\r\nbuffalo, I was both astonished and ashamed to see him standing under an\r\nelm tree not ten feet away, covered up all except his eyes by a great\r\nwild grapevine, and gazing in mute astonishment at the struggle between\r\nNimrod and his pony. I have always regretted that I took advantage of\r\nthe confidence he placed in me, for as soon as I could control my\r\njumping nerves, I shot the noble beast behind the shoulder, and he fell.\r\n\r\nI saw my last herd of buffalo in Scott County, Kansas, in 1877.\r\nAntelope, however, continued to be abundant as late as 1884, and only\r\ntwo years ago I saw a couple of them among some cattle near Monument\r\nRocks, in Gove County.\r\n\r\nIn camp, during those early days, we were rarely out of antelope meat,\r\nand even now my mouth waters at the thought of the delicious tenderloin,\r\nsoaked first in salt water to season it and remove the blood, then\r\ncovered with cracker dust, and fried in a skillet of boiling lard. In\r\nthose days a hind quarter could be hung up under the wagon in the\r\nhottest part of summer, and not spoil. The wind hermetically sealed it,\r\nand there were no blow-flies then. The early settlers of a new country\r\nbring with them, and protect, their enemies, and destroy their friends,\r\nthe skunks, badgers, wildcats, and coyotes, as well as hawks, eagles,\r\nand snakes, because they kill a chicken or two as a change from their\r\nusual diet of prairie dogs and rabbits.\r\n\r\nIn those pioneer days the Kiowas, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and other Indian\r\ntribes made constant inroads upon the venturesome settler who, following\r\nthe advice of Horace Greeley, had come West to grow up with the country.\r\n\r\nI remember when old Santante, a chief of the Kiowas, came to the post in\r\na government ambulance, which he had captured on one of his raids. In\r\ntime of peace, the Indians belong to the Interior Department of the\r\ngovernment, so that all the officer in command at the fort could do was\r\nto extend the old chief the courtesy of the army and care of himself and\r\nteam. Once, at the old stone sutler’s store, I heard him remark, after\r\nhe had filled himself well with whisky, “All the property on the Smoky\r\nHill is mine. I want it, and then I want hair.”\r\n\r\nHe got both the following year.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1867, owing to the fear of an Indian outrage, General A. J.\r\nSmith gave us at the ranch a guard of ten colored soldiers under a\r\ncolored sergeant, and all the settlers gathered in the stockade, a\r\nstructure about twenty feet long and fourteen wide, built by setting a\r\nrow of cottonwood logs in a trench and roofing them over with split\r\nlogs, brush, and earth. During the height of the excitement, the women\r\nand children slept on one side of the building in a long bed on the\r\nfloor, and the men on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe night of the third of July was so sultry that I concluded to sleep\r\noutside on a hay-covered shed. At the first streak of dawn I was\r\nawakened by the report of a Winchester, and, springing up, heard the\r\nsergeant call to his men, who were scattered in rifle pits around the\r\nbuilding, to fall in line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had them lined up, he ordered them to fire across the\r\nriver in the direction of some cottonwoods, to which a band of Indians\r\nhad retreated. The whites came forward with guns in their hands and\r\noffered to join in the fight, but the sergeant commanded: “Let the\r\ncitizens keep in the rear.” This, indeed, they were very willing to do\r\nwhen the order was given, “Fire at will!” and the soldiers began sending\r\nleaden balls whizzing through the air in every conceivable arc, but\r\nnever in a straight line, toward the enemy, who were supposed to be\r\nlying on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light my brother and I explored the river and found a\r\nplace where seven braves, in their moccasined feet, had run across a wet\r\nsandbar in the direction of the cottonwoods, as the sergeant had said.\r\nTheir pony trails could be easily seen in the high, wet grass.\r\n\r\nThe party in the stockade were not reassured to hear the tramp of a\r\nlarge body of horsemen, especially as the soldiers had fired away all\r\ntheir ammunition; but the welcome clank of sabers and jingle of spurs\r\nlaid their fears to rest, and soon a couple of troops of cavalry, with\r\nan officer in command, rode up through the gloom.\r\n\r\nAfter the sergeant had been severely reprimanded for wasting his\r\nammunition, the scout Wild Bill was ordered to explore the country for\r\nIndian signs. But, although the tracks could not have been plainer, his\r\nreport was so reassuring that the whole command returned to the Fort.\r\n\r\nSome hours later I spied this famous scout at the sutler’s store, his\r\nchair tilted back against the stone wall, his two ivory-mounted\r\nrevolvers dangling at his belt, the target of all eyes among the\r\ngarrison loafers. As I came up this gallant called out, “Well,\r\nSternberg, your boys were pretty well frightened this morning by some\r\nbuffalo that came down to water.”\r\n\r\n“Buffalo!” I said; “that trail was made by our old cows two weeks ago.”\r\n\r\nLater the general in command told me that they had prepared for a big\r\nhop at the Fort on the night of the fourth, and that Bill did not report\r\nthe Indian tracks because he did not want to be sent off on a long scout\r\njust then.\r\n\r\nIn the unsettled state of the country at this time there were other\r\ndangers to be guarded against beside that of Indians, as I learned to my\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nAs a boy of seventeen, it was my duty on the ranch to haul milk, butter,\r\neggs, and vegetables to Fort Harker for sale. I cared for my pony\r\nmyself, and in order to get the milk and other food to the Fort in time\r\nfor the soldiers’ five-o’clock breakfast, I had to go without my own.\r\nOne day I had a number of bills to collect from the officers, but as I\r\nwas unusually tired, and the officers were not out of bed when I called,\r\nI put the bills in my inside pocket and started home.\r\n\r\nAs was my custom, after leaving the garrison I lay down on the\r\nwagon-seat and went to sleep, letting my faithful horse carry me home of\r\nhis own accord. I have no recollection of what happened afterwards, but\r\nwhen I reached the ranch my brothers found me sitting up in the wagon\r\nmoaning and swinging my arms, with the blood flowing from a slung-shot\r\nwound in my forehead. I had been struck down in my sleep and robbed of\r\nall the money I had on my person, as it happened only about five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nProvidentially our nearest neighbor, D. B. Long, was a retired hospital\r\nsteward, and the post surgeon, Dr. B. F. Fryer, who was sent for\r\nimmediately, was just ready to drive to town with his team of fleet\r\nlittle black ponies. He reached the ranch in an incredibly short time,\r\nand, although respiration had ceased, those two faithful men kept up\r\nartificial respiration for hours. My oldest brother, Dr. Sternberg, for\r\nyears Surgeon-General of the Army, was also sent for, and I found him\r\nlying on a mattress by my side when I regained consciousness two weeks\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nI might tell also of the ruffians who at one time held Ellsworth City in\r\na grip of iron, and how, until they killed each other off or moved\r\nfurther west with the railroad, the dead-cart used to pass down the\r\nstreet every morning to pick up the bodies of those who had been killed\r\nin the saloons the night before, and thrown out on the pavement to be\r\nhauled away.\r\n\r\nBut, although I should like to recall more of the incidents connected\r\nwith the opening up of a new country, time presses, and I must pass on\r\nto an account of my work as a fossil hunter.\r\n\r\nI had not been long in this part of the country before I found that the\r\nneighboring hills, topped with red sandstone, contained, in isolated\r\nplaces, from a few feet to a mile in diameter and scattered through a\r\nwide expanse of country, the impressions of leaves like those of our\r\nexisting forests.\r\n\r\nThe rocks consisted of red, white, and brown sandstone, with interlaid\r\nbeds of variously-colored clays; while here and there, scattered through\r\nthe formation, were vast concretions of very hard flint-like sandstone,\r\noften standing on softer rocks that had been weathered away into\r\ncolumns, the whole giving the effect of giant mushrooms, as seen in the\r\ncuts (Figs. 1–3).\r\n\r\nThis formation, resting unconformably on the upper carboniferous rocks,\r\nbelongs to the Dakota Group of the Cretaceous Period. The sedimentary\r\nrocks were laid down during the Cretaceous Period, the closing period of\r\nthe “Age of Reptiles,” in a great ocean, whose shore line enters Kansas\r\nat the mouth of Cow Creek on the Arkansas River, and extending in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction in the vicinity of Beatrice, Nebraska, touches\r\nIowa, and passes on to Greenland.\r\n\r\nI was carried away at this time by the thoughts that had been surging\r\nthrough the hearts of men since Darwin bade them turn to nature for the\r\nanswers to their problems concerning the plants and animals of this\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nHow often in imagination I have rolled back the years and pictured\r\ncentral Kansas, now raised two thousand feet above sea level, as a group\r\nof islands scattered about in a semi-tropical sea! There are no frosts\r\nand few insect pests to mar the foliage of the great forests that grow\r\nalong its shores, and the ripe leaves fall gently into the sand, to be\r\ncovered up by the incoming tide and to form impressions and counterparts\r\nof themselves as perfect as if a Divine hand had stamped them in\r\nyielding wax.\r\n\r\nGo back with me, dear reader, and see the treeless plains of to-day\r\ncovered with forests. Here rises the stately column of a redwood; there\r\na magnolia opens its fragrant blossoms; and yonder stands a fig tree.\r\nThere is no human hand to gather its luscious fruit, but we can imagine\r\nthat the Creator walked among the trees in the cool of the evening,\r\ninhaling the incense wafted to Him as a thank-offering for their being.\r\nAll His works magnify Him. The cinnamon sends forth its perfume beside\r\nthe sassafras; linden and birch, sweet gum and persimmon, wild cherry\r\nand poplar mingle with each other. The five-lobed sarsaparilla vine\r\nencircles the tree-trunks, and in the shade grows a pretty fern. Many\r\nother beautiful plant forms grace the landscape, but the glorious\r\npicture is only for him who gathers the remains of these forests, and by\r\nthe power of his imagination puts life into them; for it is some five\r\nmillion years, according to the great Dana of my childhood days, since\r\nthe trees of this Kansas forest lifted their mighty trunks to the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—ROCKS OF LARAMIE BEDS ON SOUTH SCHNEIDER CREEK, CONVERSE\r\n    COUNTY, WYOMING.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—WEATHERED ROCKS AND LARAMIE BEDS NEAR SOUTH SCHNEIDER CREEK.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—MUSHROOM-LIKE CONCRETION KNOWN AS PULPIT ROCK.\r\n\r\n  Elm Creek, Kansas, near Sternberg’s ranch. (From Trans. Kan. Acad.\r\n    Sci.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen, therefore, I made up my mind what part I should\r\nplay in life, and determined that whatever it might cost me in\r\nprivation, danger, and solitude, I would make it my business to collect\r\nfacts from the crust of the earth; that thus men might learn more of\r\n“the introduction and succession of life on our earth.”\r\n\r\nMy father was unable to see the practical side of the work. He told me\r\nthat if I had been a rich man’s son, it would doubtless be an enjoyable\r\nway of passing my time, but as I should have to earn a living, I ought\r\nto turn to some other business. I say here, however, lest I forget it,\r\nthat, although my struggle for a livelihood has been hard, often,\r\nindeed, bitter, I have always been financially better off as a collector\r\nthan when I have wasted, speaking from the point of view of science,\r\nsome of the most precious days of my life attempting to make money by\r\nfarming or in some other business, so that I might live at home and\r\navoid the hardships and exposures of camp life.\r\n\r\nWith collecting-bag over my shoulder and pick in hand, I wandered over\r\nthe hills of Ellsworth County. If I chanced upon a locality rich in\r\nfossil leaves, thrilled with a joy that knows no comparison, I walked on\r\nair as I carried my trophies home; while if night overtook me with an\r\nempty bag, I could scarcely drag my weary limbs along.\r\n\r\nAmong the rich localities that I discovered was one which I called\r\n“Sassafras Hollow,” because of the countless sassafras leaves I quarried\r\nthere. It is situated about a mile southeast of the schoolhouse on\r\nThompson Creek, in the Hudson brothers’ neighborhood, and lies at the\r\nhead of a narrow ravine in a ledge of sandstone, with a spring beneath.\r\nHere too, the noted paleobotanist, Dr. Leo Lesquereux, collected fossils\r\nin 1872, securing among other specimens a large, beautiful leaf which he\r\nnamed in my honor “_Protophyllum sternbergii_.”\r\n\r\nI have a vivid recollection of the discovery of another locality. One\r\nnight I dreamed that I was on the river, where the Smoky Hill cuts into\r\nits northern bank, three miles southeast of Fort Harker. A perpendicular\r\nface in the colored clay impinges on the stream, and just below this\r\ncliff is the mouth of a shallow ravine that heads in the prairie half a\r\nmile above.\r\n\r\nIn my dream, I walked up this ravine and was at once attracted by a\r\nlarge cone-shaped hill, separated from a knoll to the south by a lateral\r\nravine. On either slope were many chunks of rock, which the frost had\r\nloosened from the ledges above. The spaces left vacant in these rocks by\r\nthe decayed leaves had accumulated moisture, and this moisture, when it\r\nfroze, had had enough expansive power to split the rock apart and\r\ndisplay the impressions of the leaves.\r\n\r\nOther masses of rock had broken in such a way that the spaces once\r\nfilled by the midribs and stems of the leaves admitted grass roots; and\r\ntheir rootlets, seeking the tiny channels left by the ribs and veins of\r\nthe leaves, had, with the power of growing plants, opened the doors of\r\nthese prisoners, shut up in the heart of the rock for millions of years.\r\n\r\nI went to the place and found everything just as it had been in my\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nTwo of the largest leaves known to the Dakota Group were taken from this\r\nplace. One, a great three-lobed leaf, the stem passing through an\r\near-like projection at its base, Dr. Lesquereux called _Aspidophyllum\r\ntrilobatum_; the other, equally large,—over a foot in diameter,—and\r\nthree-lobed too, but indented with large teeth, he called _Sassafras\r\ndissectum_ (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nI believe I am the only fossil hunter who has collected from this\r\nlocality. Probably my eyes saw the specimens while I was chasing an\r\nantelope or stray cow and too much occupied with the work in hand to\r\ntake note of them consciously, until they were revealed to me by the\r\ndream, the only one in my experience that ever came true. I tell this\r\nstory to show how deeply I was interested in these fossils.\r\n\r\nMy first collection, or rather the cream of it, was sent to Professor\r\nSpencer F. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution. The following is the\r\nletter which I received from him:\r\n\r\n                        SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,\r\n\r\n                                             Washington, June 8, 1870.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir:—We are duly in receipt of your letter of May 28th,\r\n  announcing the transmission of the fossil plants collected by your\r\n  brother and yourself, and shall look forward with much interest to\r\n  their arrival. As soon as possible after they reach us, we shall\r\n  submit them to competent scientific investigation, and report to you\r\n  the result.\r\n\r\n                              Very respectfully yours, etc.,\r\n                                              SPENCER F. BAIRD,\r\n                                        Assistant Secretary in Charge.\r\n\r\nThere was no money in fossils at that early day, but I prized more\r\nhighly than money the promise in the letter that my specimens would be\r\nstudied by competent authority, and that I should receive credit for my\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—FOSSIL LEAVES OF _Sassafras dissectum_.\r\n\r\n  (After Lesquereux.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—_a_, UNOPENED LEAF NODULE; _b_, NODULE OPENED TO SHOW FOSSIL\r\n    LEAF; _c, d, e, f_, VARIOUS FORMS OF FOSSIL LEAVES.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe specimens were sent to Dr. John Strong Newberry, professor in\r\nColumbia University and State Geologist of Ohio. He did not find\r\nopportunity at that time to publish the results, but long years\r\nafterwards, in 1898, I received from Dr. Arthur Hollick a copy of “Later\r\nFlora of North America,” a posthumous work of Dr. Newberry’s. Turning\r\ninstantly to the magnificent plates, I recognized some of my early\r\nspecimens, the first I ever collected that were of value to science.\r\n\r\nAlthough, owing to the long delay in publication, I lost credit for\r\nthem, and the duplicates which I had given to a friend had been used by\r\nLesquereux to illustrate some new species accredited to that friend\r\ninstead of to their rightful discoverer, Dr. Newberry kindly\r\nacknowledged my work on p. 133 of his book, where he says: “The leaf\r\nfigured on Plate X and that represented on Plate XI were included in a\r\ncollection made by Charles H. Sternberg, and Lesquereux has done only\r\njustice to him by attaching his name to the finest species contained in\r\nthe large collection of fossil plants he made there,” that is, at\r\nSassafras Hollow.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, just before Lesquereux’s great work, “The Cretaceous Flora,”\r\nappeared, I learned that the famous botanist was a guest of Lieutenant\r\nBenteen, the commander of Fort Harker. Fortunately, I had retained rough\r\nsketches of the first specimens I had sent to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. So with these I started for the Post, where I found a\r\nreception in progress in honor of the noted guest.\r\n\r\nI was introduced to the venerable botanist by his own son, who spoke to\r\nhim in French, as he was almost deaf. When I displayed my sketches, he\r\ntook me to one side, and in a corner of the room I told him the story of\r\nmy discoveries. His eyes shone when he examined the drawings. “This is a\r\nnew species,” he said, “and this, and this. Here is one described and\r\nillustrated from poorer material.”\r\n\r\nI do not remember how long we talked. I only know that the golden\r\nmoments sped by all too rapidly; and from that hour until his death in\r\n1889 we were in constant correspondence.\r\n\r\nAfter this all my collections were sent to him for description. Over\r\nfour hundred species of plants like those of our existing forests along\r\nthe Mexican Gulf, some beautiful vines, a few ferns, and even the fruit\r\nof a fig, and a magnolia flower petal, the only petal so far found in\r\nthe coarse sandstone of the Dakota Group, have rewarded my earnest\r\nefforts. The fragrance of this lovely flower seems wafted down to us\r\nthrough the myriads of ages since it bloomed.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur Hollick, in his paper, “A Fossil Petal and a Fruit from the\r\nCretaceous (Dakota Group) of Kansas,” in Contributions from the New York\r\nBotanical Garden, No. 31, says, on page 102: “Included in a collection\r\nof fossil-plant remains from the Cretaceous (Dakota Group) of Kansas,\r\nrecently obtained by the New York Botanical Garden from Charles H.\r\nSternberg of Lawrence, Kansas, are two exceedingly interesting\r\nspecimens,—one representing a large petal, the other a fleshy fruit.\r\nPetals are exceedingly rare, and I am not acquainted with any published\r\nfigure of anything of the kind which can compare with ours in regard to\r\neither size or satisfactory condition of preservation.”\r\n\r\nOf the fig, the Doctor remarks: “The fruit is plainly that of a fig,\r\nand, although some twenty-three species of _Ficus_ have been described\r\nfrom the Dakota Group, they were based upon leaf impressions. This\r\nfossil has every appearance of many dried herbarium specimens, and it is\r\nevident that it must have possessed considerable consistency in order to\r\nretain its original shape, as it has done to a certain extent, under the\r\npressure to which it must have been subjected.”\r\n\r\nIn 1888 I sent over three thousand leaf impressions from the Dakota\r\nsandstone to Dr. Lesquereux, and he selected from them over three\r\nhundred and fifty typical specimens, many of them new, for the National\r\nMuseum. Hundreds of others, identified by him, were afterwards purchased\r\nby R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., and presented to the Museum.\r\n\r\nSo feeble had the great botanist become in these last years of his life,\r\nthat friends passed before his failing eyes the trays containing these\r\ngreat collections.\r\n\r\nIn my estimation, America can show no life more unselfishly devoted to\r\nscience than that of Lesquereux, probably the most scholarly and\r\nconscientious botanist of his day. He once wrote me that he received a\r\nsalary of five dollars a day from the U. S. Geological Survey, and out\r\nof this he had to pay his artist. He labored with unfailing enthusiasm\r\nto complete his monumental work, “The Flora of the Dakota Group,” but by\r\nthe irony of fate, he never saw his beloved book in print. It was\r\npublished by the Government five years after his death, under the able\r\neditorship of Dr. F. H. Knowlton.\r\n\r\nHe passed away at the age of eighty-three.\r\n\r\n“Born in the heart of Switzerland’s mountain grandeur,” he once said,\r\n“my associations have been almost all of a scientific nature. I have\r\nlived with nature,—the rocks, the trees, the flowers. They know me, I\r\nknow them. Everything else is dead to me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                              Columbus O 14th April 75\r\n\r\n  Mr Ch. Sternberg Fort Harker\r\n      My dearest\r\n\r\n  I much approve of your purpose of studying medicine. Your taste for\r\n  natural history will help you much and encourage you. But allow me\r\n  still to say to you as a friend would do that you can not expect to\r\n  become useful to others and to yourself in science except by hard\r\n  work, pursued with patience and a final purpose. Science is a high\r\n  mountain. To go up to its top or at least high enough to gain free\r\n  atmosphere and wide horizon necessitates hard climbing, through\r\n  brushes, thickets, rocks, etc. Then when from the beginning look\r\n  around for commodious and soft paths merely enter the gloom of the\r\n  woods at the base. They are seen from nobody and see nothing but\r\n  undistinct forms and because there horizon is thus liberated to\r\n  darkness they think there is nothing else and nothing more to learn\r\n  from high above toward the top of the mountain. Moreover there is\r\n  not a true hard step as Science or in life which does not give its\r\n  reward in one way or another. While we have not a single moment of\r\n  lazziness of unmerited comfortable rest, which does not bring us\r\n  some kind of disappointment and has sent of be fraid by a little\r\n  more trouble and word.\r\n\r\n                            Yours very truly\r\n                             L. Lesquereux\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to be in constant correspondence with Lesquereux,\r\nand his letters, which I need not say I prize highly, have done more,\r\nperhaps, than any other thing to fix my determination that, come what\r\nmight, I would be a fossil hunter and add my quota to human knowledge.\r\nThe letter here reproduced has been as a lodestar to lead me on past all\r\ndiscouragements in the path which as a boy of seventeen I set out to\r\nfollow. May it shed light upon the life of some other straggler!\r\n\r\nIn 1897, not having the means to go into the vertebrate fields of\r\nwestern Kansas, I spent three months in the Dakota Group, although I\r\nknew that I had already supplied most of the museums of the world with\r\nexamples of its flora, and that there was little interest in or demand\r\nfor the leaves.\r\n\r\nI secured over three thousand leaves, however, and paid first-class\r\nfreight on them to my home at Lawrence. Then I hauled them out to my\r\nlittle twenty-acre farm, four miles southeast of town, and pitched my 9\r\n× 9 wall-tent for a workshop, flooring it and putting up a stove. There\r\nI worked from November to May, standing on my feet on an average of\r\nfourteen hours a day, with my face to the opening of the tent for light,\r\nand my back to the stove. At night I worked over a coal-oil lamp.\r\n\r\nWith a chisel-edged hammer weighing two ounces, I trimmed off the rough\r\nstone from the margin of the nodules, as illustrated in the woodcuts by\r\nChristian Weber of New York (Fig. 5, _c_, _d_, _e_, and _f_), a labor of\r\nlove on his part, for which I am deeply grateful. I smoothed down the\r\nrock with emery-stone also, and with a No. 1 needle pried away the stone\r\nfrom the petioles, leaving the impression as if it were the leaf itself\r\nstanding up in bold relief, thus bringing out all its beauty. One of my\r\nneighbors, after examining the prepared specimens, remarked, “You must\r\nhave taken a long time to carve those things. Why, they look just like\r\nleaves!”\r\n\r\nWhen no more loving labor could be bestowed on them without risk of\r\ninjuring the specimens, I laid them away in trays, to be numbered and\r\nidentified. I knew that some authorities demanded the specimens in\r\npayment for the labor of identification, and as I had to make a living\r\nout of my work, this would never do for me. So after Lesquereux’s death\r\nI undertook the work of identification myself, although I confess it\r\nhurt my conscience, as I had never had the training of a botanical\r\nauthority. I was greatly relieved, therefore, when, after selling two\r\nhundred and fifty specimens to the New York Botanical Gardens, I asked\r\nDr. Arthur Hollick whether my identifications were correct, to receive\r\nthe answer that upon a casual examination he could find no reason to\r\nmake any changes in my names. I was certainly much encouraged by such\r\nwords from this eminent authority in fossil botany.\r\n\r\nTo return to my great collection from the Dakota Group, I spent nine\r\nmonths of incessant labor upon it, and my readers may be surprised to\r\nlearn that I was delighted when Professor Macbride, of the University of\r\nIowa, purchased it for the munificent sum of three hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, the price I put upon it. My delight was even greater when I\r\nreceived the following letter, which is now and was then more highly\r\nprized than the check which it enclosed.\r\n\r\n                                   STATE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA.\r\n\r\n                                           BOTANY.\r\n\r\n                                         Iowa City, Iowa, May 1, 1898.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. STERNBERG:\r\n\r\n  The boxes are all safely here. We have at present no place for the\r\n  display of the specimens, but have opened the first three cases and\r\n  are delighted with the beauty of the material. I hope next year to\r\n  have a case for fossil plants, when I shall certainly make a display\r\n  of these beautiful leaves, and quote you as collector. I should\r\n  think the National Museum would give you employment all the time.\r\n\r\n  I trust you may have a pleasant and profitable summer, and if in\r\n  future I can in any way serve you, kindly advise me.\r\n\r\n                                     Very truly yours,\r\n                                                   THOMAS K. MACBRIDE.\r\n\r\nThis small sum enabled me to go with my son George into the chalk of\r\nKansas, where we discovered the splendid specimen of a mosasaur, now in\r\nthe museum of Iowa University. But for the timely assistance given me\r\nwhen I most needed help, it is doubtful whether Iowa would have secured\r\nthis treasure. My months of patient labor on the leaves had convinced\r\nthe authorities that my work on the mosasaur would be faithfully done.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this account of my work in the Dakota Group, I should\r\nlike to say a few words about the manner in which the nodules are formed\r\naround leaf impressions, a subject of which I have made a careful study\r\nduring years of exploration. The illustrations (Fig. 5, _a_ and _b_)\r\nshow the nodules before they are opened, and the open specimens before\r\nthey have been trimmed, as in the other cuts.\r\n\r\nThe mother rock, or matrix, as it is called, from which these\r\nconcretions come, is quite soft and easily disintegrates into yellowish\r\nsand under the influences of the weather. Through this yellowish\r\nsandstone are scattered countless leaf impressions and their\r\ncounterparts, but on account of the softness of the matrix it is\r\nimpossible to work out any leaves from the inside of the rock masses,\r\nand we should lose them altogether were it not for the following natural\r\nprocess:\r\n\r\nFalling from the trees that grew along the shore of the Cretaceous\r\nOcean, these leaves were covered with sand by the incoming tide. Some,\r\nfalling stem first, were turned over into a U-shape; others are found\r\nlying flat, and others again at various angles. The sand, accumulating\r\nthrough the years, finally became consolidated, and, being in course of\r\ntime exposed to the air, began to “weather.” In the meantime the iron\r\ncoloring matter of the vegetation had been dissolved out by the water\r\nand distributed through the rock mass. As the rock weathers away, the\r\nleaf impressions are hardened by the iron that has been dissolved out of\r\nthe sandy mass by water holding acids in solution.\r\n\r\nAs the soft rock about them continues to wear away, the nodules begin to\r\nappear above the surface, at first only as bumps slightly elevated above\r\nthe surrounding rock, but in time as complete concretions, with the form\r\nof the leaves imprisoned within, which are left standing on pedestals no\r\nthicker than a lead pencil.\r\n\r\nThen the first storm of rain or hail breaks them from their moorings;\r\nthey become independent, are reduced in size, and constantly hardened,\r\nso that often a nodule is almost pure iron ore a fraction of an inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nSo the process goes on and will continue until all the leaves within the\r\nparent rock have been protected by an iron envelope; and it is this\r\nnatural process alone which can save these beautiful impressions from\r\nfalling to pieces when the sand is freed from the rock by\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nThe locality from which I collected these specimens I have named the\r\n_Betulites_ locality, on account of the abundance of birch leaves of\r\nmany varieties which have been found there. It was discovered by the\r\nlate Judge E. P. West, collector for the University of Kansas, and\r\nProfessor Lesquereux honored him by calling one species _Betulites\r\nwestii_. He made a wonderful collection of Dakota leaves for the\r\nUniversity, many of them new to science. The locality is about a mile in\r\nlength and tops the highest hills in Ellsworth County.\r\n\r\nI have no record of the thousands of fossil leaves I have collected from\r\nthe sandstone of central Kansas. I have never kept a single specimen for\r\nmyself, although I love them dearly, and it has often been hard to give\r\nthem up. But the object of my life has been to advance human knowledge,\r\nand that could not be accomplished if I kept my best specimens to\r\ngratify myself. They had to go, and they went, often for less than they\r\ncost me in labor and expense, into the hands of those who could give\r\nauthoritative knowledge of them to the world, and preserve them in great\r\nmuseums for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have demanded as my right, in my opinion an inalienable\r\nright, although I am sorry to say that there are those who have denied\r\nit to me,—I demand that my name appear as collector on all the material\r\nwhich I have gathered from the rocks of the earth.\r\n\r\nI might have sold to showmen or dealers; in fact I have the assurance of\r\none of the largest dealers in America that I made a great mistake in\r\nselling directly to museums instead of through him. If I had done as he\r\nadvised, the thousands of fossils I have collected would have cost the\r\nmuseums fifty per cent. more than they have, and my work would have been\r\nmeasured by the money these dealers would have been pleased to allow me,\r\nand I should never have been known as one of those who have devoted\r\ntheir lives to the advancement of paleontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n             MY FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE KANSAS CHALK, 1876\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the winter of 1875 and ’76 as a student at the Kansas State\r\nAgricultural College.\r\n\r\nHere a party was gathered to explore western Kansas for fossils, under\r\nthe leadership of Professor B. F. Mudge, the enthusiastic state\r\ngeologist and a popular professor of the college. The expedition was to\r\nbe made under the auspices of Professor O. C. Marsh, of Yale College,\r\nwhose efforts have secured for that institution the largest collection\r\nperhaps in the world of American fossil vertebrates.\r\n\r\nI made every effort in my power to secure a place in the party, but\r\nfailed, as it was full when I applied. It has always been hard, however,\r\nfor me to give up what I have determined to accomplish; so, although\r\nalmost with despair, I turned for help to Professor E. D. Cope, of\r\nPhiladelphia, who was becoming so well known that a report of his fame\r\nhad reached me at Manhattan.\r\n\r\nI put my soul into the letter I wrote him, for this was my last chance.\r\nI told him of my love for science, and of my earnest longing to enter\r\nthe chalk of western Kansas and make a collection of its wonderful\r\nfossils, no matter what it might cost me in discomfort and danger. I\r\nsaid, however, that I was too poor to go at my own expense, and asked\r\nhim to send me three hundred dollars to buy a team of ponies, a wagon,\r\nand a camp outfit, and to hire a cook and driver. I sent no\r\nrecommendations from well-known men as to my honesty or executive\r\nability, mentioning only my work in the Dakota Group.\r\n\r\nI was in a terrible state of suspense when I had despatched the letter,\r\nbut, fortunately, the Professor responded promptly, and when I opened\r\nthe envelope, a draft for three hundred dollars fell at my feet. The\r\nnote which accompanied it said: “I like the style of your letter.\r\nEnclose draft. Go to work,” or words to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThat letter bound me to Cope for four long years, and enabled me to\r\nendure immeasurable hardships and privations in the barren fossil fields\r\nof the West; and it has always been one of the joys of my life to have\r\nknown intimately in field and shop the greatest naturalist America has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the frost was out of the ground, having secured a team of\r\nponies and a boy to drive them, I left Manhattan and drove out to\r\nBuffalo Park, where one of my brothers was the agent. The only house,\r\nbeside the small station building, was that occupied by the section men.\r\nGreat piles of buffalo bones along the railroad at every station\r\ntestified to the countless numbers of the animals slain by the white man\r\nin his craze for pleasure and money. A buffalo hide was worth at that\r\ntime about a dollar and a quarter.\r\n\r\nHere at Buffalo I had my headquarters for many years. A great windmill\r\nand a well of pure water, a hundred and twenty feet deep, made it a\r\nMecca for us fossil hunters after two weeks of strong alkali water. At\r\nthis well Professor Mudge’s party and my own used to meet in peace after\r\nour fierce rivalry in the field as collectors for our respective\r\npaleontologists, Marsh and Cope.\r\n\r\nWhat vivid memories I have of that first expedition!—memories of\r\ncountless hardships and splendid results. I explored all the exposures\r\nof chalk from the mouth of Hackberry Creek, in the eastern part of Gove\r\nCounty, to Fort Wallace, on the south fork of the Smoky Hill, a distance\r\nof a hundred miles, as well as the region along the north and south\r\nforks of the Soloman River.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Buffalo Station, we left civilization behind us. We made\r\nour own wagon trails, two of which especially were afterwards used by\r\nthe settlers until the section lines were constructed. One of them ran\r\ndirectly south, crossing Hackberry Creek about fifteen miles from the\r\nrailroad, at a point where there was a spring of pure water—a rare and\r\nvaluable find in that region. We camped here many times, and made such a\r\ngood trail that it was used for years. Our second trail extended across\r\nthe country, striking Hackberry Creek where Gove City now stands, and\r\nled over Plum Creek Divide, whose high ledges of yellow chalk served us\r\nas a landmark for twenty miles. From this point we could see Monument\r\nRocks, and near them the remains of an old one-company post on the Santa\r\nFé Trail. Our trail then led up the Smoky Hill to the mouth of Beaver\r\nCreek, on the eastern edge of Logan County, and followed the old road as\r\nfar west as Wallace.\r\n\r\nPrairie-dog villages extended west along all the water courses, and open\r\nprairies to the state line, and we were rarely out of sight of herds of\r\nantelope and wild horses. Near the present site of Gove City, on the\r\nsouth side of Hackberry Creek, there is a long ravine with perpendicular\r\nbanks ten feet or more in height. This ravine was at that time used as a\r\nnatural corral by some men who made a business of capturing these wild\r\nponies by following them night and day, keeping them away from their\r\nwatering places, and giving them no chance to graze, until they were\r\nexhausted. They were then easily driven into the ravine and roped; after\r\nwhich they were picketed on the prairie and soon became tame. These wild\r\nhorses were swift travelers, and the most graceful of all the wild\r\nanimals of the West, being distinguished for the beauty of their flowing\r\nmanes and tails.\r\n\r\nThere was constant danger from Indians, and in order that we might\r\nescape as much as possible the eagle eye of some scout who might be\r\npassing through the country, our tent and wagon-sheet were of brown\r\nduck. This blended with the dry, brown buffalo grass, as we traveled\r\nfrom canyon to canyon, and could not be distinguished very far even by\r\nthe trained eye of an Indian.\r\n\r\nI never carried my rifle with me. I left it in camp or in the wagon, for\r\nI soon decided that I could not hunt Indians and fossils at the same\r\ntime, and I was there for fossils.\r\n\r\nI had no unpleasant experiences with Indians, however, although I came\r\nvery near it once. It was one day late in June, when we were about three\r\nmiles north of Monument Rocks. A gentle rain early in the morning had\r\ntaken the glare from the chalk cliffs, and as this is a circumstance\r\nfavorable to the discovery of fossils, I shouldered my pick and started\r\ndown the canyon, eagerly scanning the rocks on either side.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile below camp I was startled to come upon a pony trail, so\r\ndeeply cut into the soft chalk that I knew each horse must be carrying a\r\nburden. It had been made within the hour, and as I was anxious to find\r\nout what it meant, I took the back trail to the river. There I found\r\nthat a large band of warriors had sought shelter from the rain in a\r\nwillow thicket, tying bunches of the twigs together and throwing deer or\r\nantelope skins over them to shed the water. They had squatted within\r\nthese shelters until the storm had passed, and then cooked their\r\nbreakfasts, as the live coals in many of the ash heaps testified.\r\n\r\nThere were no squaws or children along; it makes no difference whether\r\nwomen are white or red, they always lose some of their belongings\r\nwherever they go, and there was none of such property at this camp. The\r\nponies had been tied to the bushes and not allowed to graze, showing\r\nthat the party had not expected to camp here, but had simply taken\r\nshelter from the rain to avoid the discomfort of traveling with wet\r\nbuckskin moccasins and leggings. I learned later that it was a large\r\nband of Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes, under their famous chief,\r\nCrazy Horse, going north to join commands with Sitting Bull, in Montana.\r\n\r\nThe chalk beds which were the field of my labors once composed the floor\r\nof the old Cretaceous ocean, and consist almost entirely of the remains\r\nof microscopic organisms, which must have fairly swarmed in the water.\r\nThey were discovered by the late Dr. Bunn, of Lawrence, while a student\r\nin the laboratories of the Kansas State University, after Dana and\r\nothers had said there was no chalk in America.\r\n\r\nWhen the animals that inhabited this ocean died or were killed, their\r\ncarcasses, buoyed up by the gases that formed after death, floated about\r\non the surface of the water, losing a limb here, a head there, a trunk\r\nor tail somewhere else. These detached fragments, sinking to the bottom,\r\nwere covered by the soft ooze of the ocean floor, and remained there as\r\nfossils, while the sedimentary rock was being lifted three thousand feet\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\nMy explorations began on Hackberry Creek, where I went over every inch\r\nof the exposed chalk, from the creek’s mouth to its head, in Logan\r\nCounty. Then I searched the river and the ravines that cut into its\r\ndrainage area along the flanks of the divides.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps a description of a typical day’s experience in one of the long\r\nravines that gash the southern slope of the country may be of interest\r\nto my readers.\r\n\r\nHuman beings, in order to accomplish any result of moment, must be\r\nreasonably comfortable, that is, they must not be over-hungry or thirsty\r\nor sleepy. If they are, their minds will dwell upon their discomforts,\r\nand they will accomplish little, as the hungry boy, who keeps turning\r\nhis head in the direction of the sun and wondering whether it is not\r\nalmost dinner-time, is not likely to hoe much corn. My first step,\r\ntherefore, must be to find water and pitch a camp.\r\n\r\nBut often I have no idea where water is to be found, and must give as\r\nmuch care to the search as if I were looking for fossils. So while the\r\ndriver follows me with the wagon, I hunt for water and fossils at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of my ravine are bordered with cream-colored, or yellow,\r\nchalk, with blue below. Sometimes for hundreds of feet the rock is\r\nentirely denuded and cut into lateral ravines, ridges, and mounds, or\r\nbeautifully sculptured into tower and obelisk. Sometimes it takes on the\r\nsemblance of a ruined city, with walls of tottering masonry, and only a\r\nnear approach can convince the eye that this is only another example of\r\nthat mimicry in which nature so frequently indulges.\r\n\r\nThe chalk beds are entirely bare of vegetation, with the exception of a\r\ndesert shrub that “finds a foothold in the rifted rock” and sends its\r\nroots down every crevice. This shrub is one of the fossil hunter’s worst\r\nenemies. Sending its roots down the clefts in the rock, it searches out\r\nthe fossil bones that have been preserved there, and feasts upon them\r\nuntil they have been entirely consumed, thus thriving at the expense of\r\nGod’s buried dead. More fine fossil vertebrates have been destroyed by\r\nthis plant than by the denudation of the rock, or the vandal hand of\r\nman, although both of the latter have been powerful factors in the\r\ndestruction of fossils. In those days, however, there were no curiosity\r\nhunters to dig up the precious relics, so that they were more abundant\r\nthan they are now.\r\n\r\nAll this time I am wandering along the canyon in search of water.\r\nSometimes I come upon gorges only two feet wide and fifty feet deep;\r\nsometimes for five miles or more the sides of the ravine will be only a\r\nfew feet high.\r\n\r\nI know that there is water at the river, but it is so far away from my\r\nwork that I go on and on in the hope of finding some nearer at hand.\r\nDinnertime comes, and the day is so hot that perspiration flows from\r\nevery pore. A howling south wind rises and fills our eyes with clouds of\r\npure lime dust, inflaming them almost beyond human endurance. Still no\r\nwater. The driver, with horses famishing for it, makes frantic gestures\r\nto me to hurry. To ease my parched lips and swelling tongue, I roll a\r\npebble around in my mouth, or, if the season is propitious, allay my\r\nthirst with the acid juice of a red berry that grows in the ravines.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of search, I find in moist ground the borings of crawfishes;\r\nwith line and sinker I measure the depth to water a couple of feet below\r\nin these miniature wells. The welcome signal is given to Will, the\r\ndriver, and he digs a well, so that both man and beast may be supplied.\r\n\r\nIf I could sum up all the sufferings I endured in the chalk fossil\r\nfields, I should say that I suffered more from the lack of good drinking\r\nwater than from all the other ills combined. Except when we were in the\r\nvicinity of one of the half-dozen springs that are scattered about over\r\nan expanse of country a hundred miles long and forty wide, the only\r\nwater that we had to drink was alkali water, which has the same effect\r\nupon the body as a solution of Epsom salts, constantly weakening the\r\nsystem. Yet whole neighborhoods of settlers to this day have no other\r\nwater for themselves or their beasts, and they show the deteriorating\r\neffects in their faces and their walk.\r\n\r\nIf I have found, scattered along a wash, the bones of some fossil fish\r\nor reptile, as soon as we have pitched camp and eaten our meal of\r\nantelope meat, hot biscuits, and coffee, we both return with pick and\r\nshovel, and, carefully saving each weathered fragment, trace the remains\r\nto where the rest of the bones lie _in situ_, as the scientists\r\nsay,—that is, in their original position in their rocky sepulcher.\r\n\r\nThen comes the work in the hot sun, whose rays are reflected with added\r\nfervor from the glaring surface of the chalk. Every blow of the pick\r\nloosens a cloud of chalk dust, which is carried by the wind into our\r\neyes. But we labor on with unfailing enthusiasm until we have laid bare\r\na floor space upon which I can stretch myself out at full length. Lying\r\nthere on the blistering chalk in the burning sun, and working carefully\r\nand patiently with brush and awl, I uncover enough of the bones so that\r\nI can tell what I have found, and so that when I cut out the rock which\r\nholds them I shall not cut into the bones themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter they have been traced, if they lie in good, hard rock, a ditch is\r\ncut around them, and by repeated blows of the pick, the slab which\r\ncontains them is loosened.\r\n\r\nThis is then securely wrapped and strengthened with plaster or with\r\nburlap bandages that have been dipped in plaster of the consistency of\r\ncream. In the case of large specimens, boards are put lengthwise to\r\nassist in strengthening the material, so that it will bear\r\ntransportation. Later I hope to tell of a method, originated by me, by\r\nwhich the most delicate fossil, even if preserved in very loose, friable\r\nrock, may be detached and transported safely.\r\n\r\nSo, as a hunter will follow the deer, through thickets and over rocks,\r\nforgetting hunger and cold and thirst in his anxiety to get a glimpse of\r\nhis game, that he may add its antlers to his list of trophies, we fossil\r\nhunters, Professor Mudge’s party and my own, sought our prey over miles\r\nand miles of barren chalk beds, cheerfully enduring countless\r\ndiscomforts.\r\n\r\nUrged on by enthusiasm and the desire to secure finer and finer\r\nmaterial, I went over every inch of the acres of exposed chalk along\r\nthese ravines and creeks, hoping each moment to find stretched before my\r\ndelighted eyes a complete skeleton of one of those old sea serpents\r\ndescribed by Cope, or a specimen of that wonderful _Pteranodon_, or\r\ntoothless flying reptile, whose wing expanse was twenty feet or more.\r\n\r\nAll day, from the first streak of light until the last level ray forced\r\nme to leave the work, I toiled on, forgetting the heat and the miserable\r\nthirst and the alkali water, forgetting everything but the one great\r\nobject of my life—to secure from the crumbling strata of this old ocean\r\nbed the fossil remains of the fauna of Cretaceous Times.\r\n\r\nThe incessant labor, however, had a weakening effect upon my system so\r\nthat I fell a victim to malaria, and when a violent attack of shaking\r\nague came on, I felt as if fate were indeed against me.\r\n\r\nI remember how, one day, when I was in the midst of a shaking fit, I\r\nfound a beautiful specimen of a Kansas mosasaur. _Clidastes tortor_ Cope\r\nnamed it, because an additional set of articulations in the backbone\r\nenabled it to coil. Its head lay in the center, with the column around\r\nit, and the four paddles stretched out on either side. It was covered by\r\nonly a few inches of disintegrated chalk.\r\n\r\nForgetting my sickness, I shouted to the surrounding wilderness, “Thank\r\nGod! Thank God!” And I did well to thank the Creator, as I slowly\r\nbrushed away the powdered chalk and revealed the beauties of this\r\nreptile of the Age of Reptiles. Its snake-like tail and flexible\r\nmovements caused it to appear to Cope a veritable serpent, so that he\r\nput it in his new sub-order _Pythonomorpha_.\r\n\r\nI well remember the terrible journey over the rough sod to the station\r\nwith this specimen. I was seized with another attack of ague, and as I\r\njolted about in the bottom of the wagon, I thought that my head would\r\nsurely burst. Little I cared, though, so that I got my beloved fossil to\r\nthe Professor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—SKULL AND FRONT LIMB OF _Clidastes tortor_.\r\n\r\n  As collected and preserved by Charles Sternberg.

At the close, which came suddenly, as was usually the\r\ncase in Cope’s speeches, before the people had had time to come back\r\nfrom the misty past, he turned to where I was sitting on a step, and\r\nbeckoned me to him. When I got within reach, he turned me around to the\r\naudience and said: “Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you\r\nMr. Sternberg, the man who found this beautiful example of the fauna of\r\nthe Cretaceous.”\r\n\r\nHe was much pleased with the hearty applause that greeted me.\r\n\r\nThis incident illustrates one of the characteristics of Cope which\r\nendeared him to all his collectors. He did not think that the money he\r\npaid them paid for the dangers and privations they endured, far from\r\ntheir friends and the comforts of civilization. On the contrary, he gave\r\nthem credit in all his publications for their discoveries of species new\r\nto science. And this is the one essential thing to the collector—at\r\nleast the true collector who values his labor as something that cannot\r\nbe measured by money. All work done for science has a value above that\r\nof money. Lesquereux might have made money if he had remained a\r\nwatchmaker, and Cope would have won a fortune as a ship-owner if he had\r\nentered his father’s office, but both men realized that there is work\r\nwhich offers higher rewards than riches; they gave their lives to\r\nscience, and they will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut we are far afield; let us return to the plains and canyons of the\r\nKansas chalk beds.\r\n\r\nI recall many trying experiences during that memorable first season.\r\nOften we got into barren ground and walked over miles and miles of\r\nblistering chalk with nothing to show for our trouble. In one locality\r\nthe remains might be very abundant, while in another, perhaps just as\r\npromising in appearance, thousands of acres would be entirely barren.\r\nBut we had to go over it all before we could be sure that there was\r\nnothing to repay our toil.\r\n\r\nOnce after two weeks of fruitless effort, we drove into a deep canyon,\r\ncut into the upper or reddish chalks near Monument Rocks, which are so\r\nmuch richer in fossils than the yellow or whitish beds farther east.\r\n\r\nI had barely pitched the tent and got among the beds when I discovered\r\nnot only that I was the first collector to visit the canyon but that it\r\nwas rich in fossil remains. I found two specimens of _Platecarpus_, a\r\nspecies of Kansas mosasaur, in a low knoll, separated by but three feet\r\nof chalk.\r\n\r\nAt the same time one of those uncomfortable cold rains set in, and I was\r\nnot much encouraged when Will told me that we had no food left. There\r\nwas plenty of corn for the ponies, but no coffee, flour, bacon, or\r\ncanned goods, not even an antelope; and we were forty miles from our\r\nbase of supplies. I would not leave, however, without my load of\r\nfossils, as I feared that during my absence my rivals would come upon\r\nthis Eldorado and clean it out. So the cook was told to parch a\r\nkettleful of corn, and we made our meals on that. In fact, we filled our\r\npockets with it and lived on it for three days, eating most of the time\r\nto keep ourselves sufficiently nourished.\r\n\r\nWe had always depended for fuel upon the buffalo chips which even then\r\nwere strewn about everywhere, but fortunately we found here an old dead\r\ncottonwood tree, a rare thing in that region, where even the willows on\r\nthe river banks are short and stunted. But for this wood we should have\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nWe remained there until we had loaded our wagon with eight hundred\r\npounds of fossil vertebrates.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer my constant use of a large butcher knife in cutting\r\naway the chalk from specimens caused a felon to form in the palm of my\r\nhand. A fistula resulted, and for ten days I slept but little, and could\r\nnot work in the field.\r\n\r\nFinally, worn out by hard labor and constant attacks of ague, I felt\r\nthat my strength was failing, and called on Professor Cope for an\r\nassistant. He sent me J. C. Isaac, from Illges Ranch, Wyoming; but\r\nmatters were not much improved, for Mr. Isaac had but a short time\r\nbefore seen five of his companions shot down and scalped by a band of\r\nmarauding Indians, and only the swiftness of his horse had saved him\r\nfrom the same fate. Consequently, he saw an Indian behind every bush;\r\nand, although I had never been afraid before even when I learned that a\r\nlarge party on the warpath had passed close to my camp, now, worn and\r\ntired as I was, I became infected with his fears.\r\n\r\nWhen I found that I could do nothing to get myself out of this mental\r\ncondition and be of further use to the Professor, I wrote to him, and\r\nwas ordered home for rest, to meet him later in Omaha, in company with\r\nMr. Isaac.\r\n\r\nBut before we return to civilization, will my readers go with me on\r\nanother expedition to these Kansas chalk beds? “How fleet is a glance of\r\nthe mind!” Instead of an arid, treeless plain, covered with short grass,\r\na great semi-tropical ocean lies at our feet. Everywhere along the\r\nshores and estuaries are great forests of magnolia, birch, sassafras,\r\nand fig, while a vast expanse of blue water stretches southward.\r\n\r\n“But,” you ask, “what is that animal at full length upon the water in\r\nthat sheltered cove?”\r\n\r\nWatch it a moment! It raises a long conical head, four feet in length\r\nand set firmly upon a neck of seven strongly spined vertebræ. This\r\npowerful head terminates in a long, bony rostrum, also conical in shape.\r\nBack of the neck are twenty-three large dorsal vertebræ, followed by six\r\npygals, as Dr. Williston calls them, to which the hind arches and\r\npaddles are attached. The body terminates in an eel-like tail of over\r\neighty elements, each strengthened by a dorsal spine above and a\r\nV-shaped bone, called a chevron, below; so that a vertical section of\r\nthe lizard would have a diamond shape.\r\n\r\nBut see! an enemy in the distance is attracting our reptile’s attention.\r\nIt sets its four powerful paddles in motion, and unrolling its forked\r\ntongue from beneath its windpipe, throws it forward with a threatening\r\nhiss, the only note of defiance it can raise. The flexible body and long\r\neel-like tail set up their serpentine motion, and the vast mass of\r\nanimal life, over thirty feet in length, rushes forward with\r\never-increasing speed through water that foams away on either side and\r\ngurgles in a long wake behind.\r\n\r\nThe great creature strikes its opponent with the impact of a racing\r\nyacht and piercing heart and lungs with its powerful ram, leaves a\r\nbleeding wreck upon the water. Then raising its head and fore paddles\r\ninto the air, it bids defiance to the whole brute creation, of which it\r\nis monarch.\r\n\r\nA noble specimen of this great ram-nosed Tylosaur is now mounted as a\r\npanel on the wall of the American Museum, in New York, at the head of\r\nthe stairs on the right (Fig. 8); and a little further on, is a splendid\r\nskull of the same species, which I discovered on Butte Creek, in Logan\r\nCounty. Fig. 9 shows a restoration of this species.\r\n\r\nDoubtless many of the ankylosed bones which we fossil hunters often find\r\nin the chalk of the Niobrara Group of the Cretaceous were broken by\r\nblows from these ram-nosed lizards.\r\n\r\nWe have in Kansas three genera of these mosasaurs as the celebrated\r\nFrenchman, Cuvier, named them in 1808. The word literally means a\r\nreptile of the Meuse, and it was given them because the first specimen\r\never found was taken from the quarries under the city of Maestricht, on\r\nthe River Meuse. For this information, and for much more as to the\r\nanatomy of the Kansas mosasaurs, I am indebted to Dr. Williston’s\r\nsplendid work in Volume IV of the University Geological Survey of\r\nKansas: Paleontology, Part I; although, of course, I obtained most of my\r\nknowledge from the hundreds of specimens which I collected myself.\r\n\r\nAmong these are four especially fine specimens, nearly complete, of the\r\nflat-wristed _Platecarpus coryphæus_ Cope. One of them I sent to the\r\nIowa State University, with head, column, and limbs nearly in position,\r\nand still bedded in their native chalk. This fellow, who was over\r\neighteen feet long, must have sunk so deep in the slimy mud of the\r\nocean-bed that even the gases formed in his stomach could not lift his\r\nbody to the surface. A second specimen was sent to the British Museum of\r\nNatural History, in London; a third to Munich, Bavaria, and a fourth to\r\nthe Roemer Museum, in Hildesheim, Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—RAM-NOSED TYLOSAUR, _Tylosaurus dyspelor_.\r\n\r\n  Restoration by Osborn and Knight. (From painting in American Museum of\r\n    Natural History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—SKULL OF THE FLAT-WRISTED MOSASAUR, _Platecarpus coryphæus_.\r\n\r\n  (In the Kansas State University.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis last specimen is the best I ever took from the Kansas chalk until\r\n1907. It is twenty-five feet long. Unfortunately, the head was all\r\nwashed away, with the exception of the mandibles and a few bones of the\r\nskull. The most remarkable feature of this specimen was the presence,\r\nfor the first time in my experience, of the complete cartilaginous\r\nbreastbone with the cartilaginous ribs, which are very rare. They were\r\ndescribed for the first time from the noble Bourne specimen, by Dr. H.\r\nF. Osborn, of the American Museum.\r\n\r\nThis mosasaur, _Platecarpus_, is the most common species known, and is\r\nalmost as large as the big _Tylosaurus_. It differs from the latter,\r\nhowever, in the shape of the short, strong paddles and the blunt\r\nrostrum. The skull in the illustration (Fig. 10) is that of a very fine\r\nspecimen, one of my discoveries, which was mounted by Mr. Bunker, of the\r\nnatural history department in the Kansas State University. I have never\r\nseen a more complete skull, or one that shows the height so well, in any\r\nspecimen, unless it is the little _Clidastes velox_, in the Kansas\r\nUniversity collection. You will notice the triangular shape of the head,\r\nwith the strong bones arching back to support the lower jaw by the\r\npulley-like quadrate bone. Notice also that the suspensorium, instead of\r\ncurving down so that its groove fits over the rounded edge of the\r\nquadrate, is straightened out. This is caused by its having been\r\nflattened and distorted, as nearly all fossils are, by the immense\r\npressure to which it has been subjected. Observe the conical shape of\r\nthe head in front of the eye-rim, terminating in the hard, blunt\r\nrostrum. It is believed by the authorities that a blow from this ram,\r\ndelivered at full speed, would put an adversary out of commission.\r\n\r\nBut how did this creature feed itself, when all its teeth are for\r\ngrasping, none for masticating? And how did it hold its prey, when it\r\nhas no claw-armed fingers, only weak paddles for swimming?\r\n\r\nIn answering these questions, we shall describe two characteristics of\r\nthe mosasaurs which differentiate them from all other reptiles.\r\n\r\nIf you will look closely at the photograph, you will notice, within the\r\nhead, and below the eye-socket, a row of recurved teeth. These are the\r\nteeth on the pterygoid bones, which are located on either side of the\r\nroof of the mouth, near the gullet, and are provided with twelve teeth,\r\nmore or less. The lower jaw with its powerful sweep on its fulcrum,\r\npressed the living prey firmly upon these teeth so that it could not\r\ncome forward and escape. Then notice the ball-and-socket joint just back\r\nof the tooth-bearing bone or dentary, of the lower jaw. After the\r\nwriggling, struggling prey had been fastened on the teeth in the roof of\r\nthe mouth, the mandibles were shortened by a spreading of this central\r\njoint, and the victim was forcibly pushed down the throat.\r\n\r\nThe species _Clidastes velox_ of these Kansas mosasaurs, was, as its\r\nname indicates, very agile, with beautiful bones of so firm a texture\r\nthat they have suffered less than any of the other fossil vertebrates\r\nfrom the vast pressure to which they have been subjected, not only from\r\nthe enormous amount of material that has been heaped above them, but\r\nfrom the still more powerful upward push which has raised their\r\nburial-place three thousand feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nI sent one very beautiful specimen of _Clidastes_ to Vassar College; so\r\ncomplete, in fact, that it can be made into a panel mount.\r\n\r\nI think no artist has more fully appreciated what these great reptiles\r\nmust have been when alive than Mr. Sidney Prentice, now of the Carnegie\r\nMuseum, whose beautiful restoration, made to illustrate Dr. Williston’s\r\nwork on Kansas Mosasaurs, is here reproduced (Fig. 11_b_). I am under\r\nobligations to him for the labor of his pencil. He has certainly put\r\nlife into this denizen of the old Cretaceous ocean, and I do not believe\r\nthat anyone, after a careful study of the skeleton, could find any fault\r\nwith the restoration, from a scientific standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I should like also to call attention to the\r\nbeautifully preserved skull I sent to the Carnegie Museum. This specimen\r\nshows a complete side view of the head, with mandibles and maxilla, the\r\nteeth interlacing as perfectly as in life. The sclerotic plates that\r\nprotect the eyeball are also in natural position.\r\n\r\nThe luxuriant life of the Cretaceous ocean was certainly remarkable.\r\nFish swarmed everywhere, and often, as the specimens are uncovered, the\r\nscales are picked up by the wind, crumbled into dust, and scattered in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nAmong the most common of the fossil bones in those early days were those\r\nof a huge fish, whose vertebræ, with fragments of heads and jaws, were\r\nfound in great abundance, although no perfect specimen has been\r\ndiscovered. Professor Cope, who described this fish, called it _Portheus\r\nmolossus_. I secured a fine specimen on Robinson’s ranch, in Logan\r\nCounty. It lay in a small exposure of chalk along a grassy hill slope,\r\nwithin a stone’s throw of the ranch buildings. My son George was my\r\nassistant then, and we got out this specimen in the month of November.\r\nOur boarding place was five miles away, and every night the ground froze\r\nhard. Nothing daunted, we went to work with a will.\r\n\r\nThe head and trunk region had already been uncovered, and many of the\r\nribs and spines had been swept away and lost. We took up the head and\r\nfront fins in a great slab of plaster, as the chalk in which they lay\r\nhad disintegrated under the influence of the frost. A violent windstorm\r\nwas raging at the time, and to complete the slab, George had to bring\r\nwater from a tank a hundred yards away. I can still see that boy running\r\nup with his pail of water, trying to carry it so that it would not be\r\nemptied by the raging, howling wind that was almost tearing his coat\r\nfrom his back, while I stood and shouted, “Hurry up! The plaster’s\r\nhardening!”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the column, to the tail, we took up separately, and as the\r\ngreat tail-fins and many of the caudal vertebræ were present with their\r\nspines, embedded in solid chalk, we removed five feet of superincumbent\r\nrock, cut a trench around the slab containing the bones, and took it up\r\nby digging under it.\r\n\r\nThis made another huge mass to be handled. The section containing the\r\nhead weighed over six hundred pounds, and this tail section almost as\r\nmuch. The latter froze solid before we could get it up to the tent,\r\nwhere we kept a fire burning to dry out the water from the bones and\r\nthus prevent the injurious effects of freezing. I should like just here\r\nto express my gratitude to those ranchmen who gave their time and\r\nstrength to assist me in handling these huge sections.\r\n\r\nWhen they had been packed with excelsior in strong boxes, a wagon was\r\nbacked up against the level platform which we had made in throwing out\r\nthe rock and soil that lay over the specimen. The boxes were then set on\r\nedge, and, with the help of boards and rollers, loaded into the wagon\r\nfor shipment to the railroad thirty miles away.\r\n\r\nBut my troubles with this specimen were not over; on the contrary, they\r\nhad just begun. When the section containing the head was being raised on\r\nto a table in my shop it fell and its weight was so great that the head\r\nwas badly shattered, as was the plaster that secured the bones in place\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThen all through the winter, while I was trying to dry out the specimen,\r\nso that it could be cleaned and prepared for shipment, the rats, which\r\ninhabited the walls of the laboratory in great numbers, kept pulling out\r\nthe bran and excelsior that had been put around the delicate bones to\r\nprotect them; thus causing the broken plaster, with the bones of the\r\nhead, to sink lower and lower, as the packing was carried away from\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—RESTORATION OF KANSAS CRETACEOUS ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n  (From drawing by S. Prentice, after Williston.)\r\n\r\n  _a_, _Uintacrinus socialis_; _b_, _Clidastes velox_; _c_,\r\n    _Ornithostoma ingens_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—GIANT CRETACEOUS FISH, _Portheus molossus_ (above), compared\r\n    with a six-foot modern Tarpon (below).\r\n\r\n  By courtesy of American Museum of Natural History.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDriven to think out some plan of saving the specimen from destruction, I\r\nconceived the idea of shoving a number of wooden pegs of various lengths\r\nunder the broken fragments, so as to push them up into their places and\r\nhold them firmly there. All the excelsior was then taken away from\r\nbeneath them, a frame of lumber made around the section, and the whole\r\nspace filled with plaster which held all the broken bones in place.\r\n\r\nIn this specimen I found for the first time a complete column of\r\neighty-five vertebræ, a very important find, as these vertebræ are of so\r\nnearly the same size that in restoring an incomplete specimen there was\r\nno way of estimating how many of them there ought to be, and for\r\nanything to the contrary, one might go on adding them indefinitely, as a\r\ncertain man in Europe added an enormous number to his mounted specimen\r\nof a _Zeuglodon_.\r\n\r\nThis now famous specimen is mounted above the Bourne Tylosaur, in the\r\ncorridor of the Halls of Paleontology, at the American Museum. Dr. Henry\r\nFairfield Osborn, in his report describing it, says: “The noble specimen\r\nof which a preliminary description is here given, adds another to the\r\nmany services which Mr. Charles H. Sternberg has rendered to vertebrate\r\npaleontology. It was secured by him in the year 1900, near Elkader,\r\nLogan County, Kansas. Originally the specimen had been probably\r\ncomplete, but portions of the skeleton, especially the ribs and spines,\r\nwere injured and partly removed by previous explorers. The fish was\r\npurchased by the Museum in 1901, and mounted and partly restored, under\r\nthe direction of the writer, by Adam Hermann, with the able assistance\r\nof Mr. A. E. Anderson. Total length, from tip of tail to a point\r\ndirectly above premaxillaries, 15 feet, 8 inches. Length of skull, 2\r\nfeet, 2 inches. Spread of tail, 3 feet, 9 inches.” (Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\nAt the time it was mounted, this great predaceous fish of the Cretaceous\r\nwas said to be the most striking example of a fossil fish in any museum\r\nof the world. Since that day, however, a still finer one has been sent\r\nto the Carnegie Museum. This specimen is much superior to that at the\r\nAmerican Museum, as the ribs, spines, pelvic fins, arches, and anal fin\r\nare in position.\r\n\r\nI should certainly be guilty of a great injustice to my friend and the\r\nfriend of paleontology, Mr. W. O. Bourne, of Scott City, whose name has\r\nalready appeared in these pages in connection with the great Tylosaur in\r\nthe American Museum, if I did not give him due credit for his share in\r\nthe securing of this specimen. He discovered the splendid fish and\r\ntumbled a small mountain over on top of it to hide it. Then he kindly\r\ngave it to me, and after much digging, my son was able to get trace of\r\nit. Mr. Bourne showed his wisdom in thus covering it up, not only from\r\nthe elements, but also from man, who, out of curiosity, has destroyed\r\nsome splendid examples of creative power. I shall mention one or two as\r\nobject lessons before I complete this history.\r\n\r\nBut let us put life into this fish, whose bones now lie in the Carnegie\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nWe are back again where the two mosasaurs did battle royal for our\r\nenjoyment. Watch that ripple! It is caused by a shoal of mackerel\r\nscurrying in toward shallow water, in a mighty column five feet deep.\r\nThey are flying for their lives, for they have seen behind them their\r\nmost terrible enemy, a monster fish with a muzzle like a bulldog’s, and\r\nhuge fangs three inches long projecting from its mouth. Two rows of\r\nhorrid teeth, one above and one below, complete its armature. The great\r\njaws, fourteen inches long and four deep, move on a fulcrum, and when\r\nthey have dropped to seize a multitude of these little fish, they close\r\nwith a vise-like power. The crushed and mangled remains pass down a\r\ncavernous throat to appease a voracious appetite.\r\n\r\nThe powerful front fins are armed with an outer ray that moves on a\r\njoint in the pectoral arch, a long recurved piece of solid bone,\r\nenameled on the outer side and more powerful as a weapon than a\r\ncavalryman’s sword. This single-edged sword is three feet long, and\r\ncommands the respect of its owner’s enemies, the great saurians, or\r\nKansas mosasaurs. Our fish has only to swim up close to the abdomen of a\r\nsleeping reptile, and lay it open for several feet with one sudden\r\nstroke. If that is not sufficient, a slap of the powerful tail, with a\r\nspan of nearly four feet, finishes the work.\r\n\r\nBut see! nearer and nearer the great fish comes, mouthful after mouthful\r\nof the fishes falling into its horrid jaws. It must be starving; so\r\neager is it for its prey that it seems unconscious of the fact that the\r\ntide has turned and is moving outward. Now it discovers its danger and\r\nturns, but too late. The water has gone back to the deep, leaving it\r\nstruggling for breath in a shallow pool. It thrashes wildly about with\r\nits tail, whose sticky secretions help to envelop it more and more\r\nthickly with mud and slime, until at last its struggles cease.\r\n\r\nAnd then the scene changes. The old ocean disappears, and we stand,\r\nGeorge and I, three thousand feet above sea level, on Hay Creek, in\r\nLogan County, among crumbling ruins of denuded and eroded chalk; and\r\nworking with pick and shovel in the burning sun, we bring the mighty\r\ncarcass once more to the light of day.\r\n\r\nBut I hope to take my readers into this field again, and will pass on\r\nnow to my expedition in the Bad Lands with Professor Cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\nEXPEDITION WITH PROFESSOR COPE TO THE BAD LANDS OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS,\r\n                                  1876\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the first of August, 1876, Mr. Isaac and I were in Omaha, awaiting\r\nthe arrival of Professor Cope from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWe met him at the depot, and I remember his watching me with\r\nastonishment as I limped along the street on my crippled leg. At last,\r\nturning to Isaac, whom he knew to be a horseman, he asked, “Can Mr.\r\nSternberg ride a horse?”\r\n\r\nIsaac answered: “I’ve seen him mount a pony bareback and cut out one of\r\nhis mares from a herd of wild horses.”\r\n\r\nThat satisfied the Professor, and when we got to Montana, he gave me the\r\nworst-tempered pony in the bunch.\r\n\r\nWe were soon hurrying along over the treeless plains of Nebraska,\r\ngaining in altitude every hour, until we reached the highlands of the\r\nGreat Divide, and plunged down into Weber and Echo canyons, whose\r\nforests are dwarfed into miniatures by the majesty of the mountains\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that I had ever been among these stupendous cliffs\r\nand ranges, and I held my breath for very wonder as they unfolded before\r\nmy astonished vision. They soon became familiar sights enough, but\r\nnever, even when I gazed every day upon the three Tetons, with the snow\r\nglistening in their gorges in midsummer, or upon the mighty ranges of\r\nthe Rockies, did I lose my feeling of awe at the power here displayed by\r\nthe almighty Architect who carved these wonderful canyons and set these\r\ntowering peaks as solemn sentinels over the works of His hands.\r\n\r\nWe had the pleasure of Mrs. Cope’s company as far as Ogden. Then we\r\nthree men, taking the narrow-gauge railway, went on to Franklin, Idaho.\r\nHere the most uncomfortable journey I have ever experienced awaited\r\nus,—six hundred miles in a Concord coach, through the dry, barren plains\r\nof Idaho. Our six horses raised clouds of fine dust, which penetrated\r\nour clothing and filled our eyes and ears, and, sticking to the\r\nperspiration that oozed from every pore, soon gave us the appearance of\r\nhaving the jaundice.\r\n\r\nI cannot begin to describe the discomforts of that terrible ride. We\r\ntraveled ten miles an hour, day and night, stopping only for meals,\r\nwhich cost us a dollar each, and consisted of hot soda biscuit, black\r\ncoffee, bacon, and mustard, without butter, milk, or eggs. If, worn out\r\nfrom continued loss of sleep, we dozed off for a moment, a sudden lurch\r\nof the coach into a chuck-hole would break our heads against a post or a\r\nneighbor’s head. I remember that once when the Professor was almost\r\nexhausted from lack of sleep I took his head in my arms and held it\r\nthere, so that he might get a few hours’ rest. I should like here to\r\nexpress my gratitude to the fellow passengers who so often gave me a\r\nseat by the driver, where, buttoned in by the leathern apron, I got more\r\nthan my share of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the mountains, the beauty of the scenery and the absence\r\nof dust made the journey more endurable, but we had to walk up all the\r\nsteep ascents.\r\n\r\nAt Helena we laid off for a few days. There the news was fresh from the\r\nbattle-field, of Custer and the brave men who had followed him to death.\r\nA letter of his, written just before he entered the valley of death, was\r\nread to us by the proprietor of the hotel. I remember one sentence of\r\nit: “We have found the Indians, and are going in after them. We may not\r\ncome out alive.”\r\n\r\nAll was excitement, and the Professor was strongly advised against the\r\nfolly of going into the neutral ground between the Sioux and their\r\nhereditary enemies, the Crows. A member of either tribe might kill us,\r\nand lay our death to the other tribe.\r\n\r\nCope, however, reasoned that now was our time to go into this region,\r\nsince every able-bodied Sioux would be with the braves under Sitting\r\nBull, while the squaws and children would be hidden away in some\r\nfastness of the mountains. There would be no danger for us, he argued,\r\nuntil the Sioux were driven north by the soldiers who were gathering\r\nunder Terry and Crook for the final struggle.\r\n\r\nJudging from past experience, he concluded that we should have nearly\r\nthree months in which to make our collections in peace. We would leave\r\nthe field, he said, when we learned that the great chief was being so\r\nclosely pressed as to be forced to seek safety in flight to the soil of\r\nGreat Britain, across the Sweet Grass Mountains into Assiniboia.\r\n\r\nHis judgment proved good. It was not until November, when a heavy\r\nsnowstorm had covered both the fossil fields and grass for the ponies,\r\nthat Sitting Bull gave up the unequal struggle against cold and the Boys\r\nin Blue, and retreated to a more friendly soil.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Benton we found a typical frontier town of that day,—streets\r\npaved with playing-cards, and whisky for sale in open saloons and\r\ngroceries. Our presence had been heralded abroad during our stay in\r\nHelena, and the Professor had difficulty in securing an outfit without\r\npaying an exorbitant price for it They knew him to be a stranger, and\r\nthey “took him in.”\r\n\r\nFinally, however, he secured four horses for the wagon. The wheelers\r\nwere worn-out mustangs, which we were obliged to punish constantly to\r\nkeep at work, while one of the leaders, a fine four-year-old colt, had\r\nto be knocked down half a dozen times before he could be taught not to\r\nbalk and strike out with his fore feet at everyone who came within\r\nreach. The other leader, old Major, was as true as steel, and often\r\nsaved the day, doing his duty nobly in spite of the miserable company in\r\nwhich he was forced to work.\r\n\r\nThe first night Mr. Isaac and I slept outside the town, with the four\r\nwagon horses and the three saddle ponies, which were all picketed with\r\nnew rope. In the middle of the night, we heard an animal groaning, and\r\nrushed out, to find our four-year-old cut fearfully beneath the fetlocks\r\nby the ropes. We had to cut him loose, help him up, and bind his wounds.\r\nHe was able to travel the next day, however, and his accident was not\r\naltogether a misfortune, as he was too sore for some time afterwards to\r\nshow his natural disposition.\r\n\r\nWe drove down to the mouth of the Judith River, opposite Claggett, where\r\nan Indian trader had a store inclosed in a stockade. Here we went into\r\ncamp. Across the river were the lodges of two thousand Crow Indians, who\r\nwere preparing for their annual buffalo hunt in this neutral ground,\r\nwhere Sioux and Crow alike buried the hatchet while they hunted the game\r\nthat was their principal sustenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaac, with the dread of the Redman still in his heart, insisted\r\nthat we must protect the camp by standing guard over it turn and turn\r\nabout, and to pacify him, the guard was mounted. I took the first turn,\r\nand Mr. Isaac the second.\r\n\r\nThe Professor did me the honor of sharing his tent with me, and we were\r\njust dozing off when we heard Mr. Isaac shout “Halt!” Looking out, we\r\nsaw an Indian approaching, with his squaw behind him, the moonlight\r\nbringing out their forms in bold relief.\r\n\r\n“Halt! Halt!” called Isaac, leveling his Winchester, but the Indian,\r\nfollowed by his faithful squaw, continued to advance up to the very\r\nmuzzle of the gun, repeating, “Me good Indian! Me good Indian!”\r\n\r\nCope dressed and went out, and found that the Indian had mistaken us for\r\nillicit whisky dealers, and come over to get a supply. The Professor\r\ntold the man to go to sleep under the wagon, and at daylight to recross\r\nand invite half a dozen of the principal chiefs to breakfast with us.\r\n\r\nThe two Indians lay down and went to sleep as directed, but they had\r\njust begun to snore peacefully when Isaac’s turn at guard duty was over,\r\nand he came to the wagon to wake the cook, a slow, heavy man, whose fat\r\ncheeks had induced the Professor to believe that he could cook\r\ndigestible food. The scout Cope had hired was not on hand, although he,\r\nas well as the cook, had demanded his pay in advance before he would\r\naccompany us.\r\n\r\nAfter much growling, the cook got up, and remembering that he had left\r\nhis shoes under the wagon, went to get them and came upon the sleeping\r\nbeauties. Without more ado, he seized their dirty blanket in both hands\r\nand coolly hauled them out on to the open prairie. After which he\r\nproceeded to get his shoes.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the morning it was Cope’s turn to go on guard. He was\r\nawakened, but as his Spencer carbine was at the bottom of his trunk, and\r\nperhaps, too, because he was a Friend, and did not believe in war, he\r\nrefused to get up; and we slept in safety the rest of the night without\r\na guard.\r\n\r\nJust before breakfast the Professor, as was his custom, was washing his\r\nset of false teeth in a basin of water, when a party of six stalwart\r\nchieftains strode up in single file, in answer to his invitation through\r\nthe brave we had entertained.\r\n\r\nQuickly slipping the teeth into his mouth, Cope advanced with a smiling\r\nface to greet his guests, who shouted as one man, “Do it again! Do it\r\nagain!” He repeated the performance for them again and again, much to\r\ntheir mystification.\r\n\r\nAfter they had tried to pull out their own and each other’s teeth, and\r\nhad failed, they settled down to breakfast. The cook poured out their\r\ncoffee for them, and when they had had enough they shouted, “When!”\r\n\r\nWe never knew whether this hospitality was of any benefit to us, as the\r\nwhole tribe went on their buffalo hunt, and we saw no more of them, but\r\nvery likely their chiefs forbade petty stealing from our camp, for we\r\nlost nothing.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Missouri, here a clear, sparkling stream, and the Judith\r\nRiver, and went into camp in the narrow valley of Dog Creek, in the\r\nmidst of the fossil fields which we had come so far and at such risks to\r\nexplore.\r\n\r\nAll about us stretched the interminable labyrinths of the Bad Lands.\r\nAbove us lay twelve hundred feet of denuded rock, which Cope at that\r\ntime believed to belong to several formations. The rock consists of\r\ngreat beds of black shale, which disintegrates on the surface into a\r\nfine, black dust. The lower levels contain many beds of lignite, which\r\nmakes a good soft coal, and burns readily. We found beds four feet thick\r\nalong the canyons. All one had to do was to drive up to the face of the\r\ncliff and load a wagon in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first streak of daylight appeared, we breakfasted and\r\nwere off, our picks tied to our saddles, our collecting-bags dangling\r\nfrom the pommels, and a lunch of cold bacon and hardtack in our\r\nsaddle-bags.\r\n\r\nI usually rode beside the Professor, my mount a treacherous black\r\nmustang, who was ever on the watch to regain his liberty. A curb bit\r\nthat almost tore his mouth to pieces was my only means of restraining\r\nhim. My right ear being totally deaf, I usually rode at the Professor’s\r\nright, when the trail would admit of our traveling abreast. He was not\r\nalways in a talkative mood, but when he began to speak of the wonderful\r\nanimals of this earth, those of long ago and those of to-day, so\r\nabsorbed did he become in his subject that he talked on as if to\r\nhimself, looking straight ahead and rarely turning toward me, while I\r\nlistened entranced.\r\n\r\nNot so that wicked black mustang of mine. Suddenly his front feet would\r\nleave the ground, and he would stand up at full length on his hind legs.\r\nThen feeling the gouging of the Spanish bit, he would drop and run ahead\r\nto the Professor’s left side. When the Professor, happening to look up,\r\nfound the place where I had been vacant, he would exclaim in surprise,\r\n“Why, I thought you were on my right, and here you are on my left!”\r\n\r\nThe pony repeated this trick whenever I became so deeply interested in\r\nthe Professor’s talk as to loosen my hold on the reins.\r\n\r\nOn the very top of the Bad Lands were the Judith River beds, now known,\r\nthrough the researches of the late Professor J. B. Hatcher, to belong to\r\nthe Fort Pierre Group of the Upper Cretaceous. Here tablelands and level\r\nprairies offered plenty of grass for our ponies; so we climbed to these\r\nheights, picketed our horses, and went into the gorges in search of\r\nfossils. It was necessary to give the loose shale the most careful\r\nexamination, as only a streak of dust a little different in color from\r\nthe uniform black around it, indicated where the bones were buried.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the loose composition of this friable black shale and the\r\noverlying rocks of sandstone, the Missouri has lowered its bed twelve\r\nhundred feet below the level of the prairies, and the whole country is\r\ncut up by a perfect labyrinth of canyons and lateral ravines into a\r\ndreary landscape of utter barrenness.\r\n\r\nAt night the view from above of these intricate passages was appalling.\r\nThe black material of which the rocks are composed did not permit a\r\nsingle ray of light to penetrate the depths below, and the ebony-like\r\ndarkness seemed dense enough to cut.\r\n\r\nLong ridges, terminating in perpendicular cliffs, whose bases impinge\r\nupon the river a thousand feet below, extend back into the country for\r\nmiles. Often they are cut by lateral ravines into peaks and pinnacles,\r\nobelisks and towers, and other fantastic forms. These ridges are so\r\nnarrow that we could hardly walk along them, and their sides drop at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees. It was only the disintegrated shale on the\r\nsurface, into which our feet sank at every step, that gave us a foothold\r\nand kept us from shooting with frightful velocity into the gorges below.\r\n\r\nOne day the Professor asked me to climb to a point near the summit of a\r\nlofty ridge, crowned by two massive ledges of sandstone, four feet\r\nthick, which projected over the steep slope like the window sills of\r\nsome Titanic building. These ledges, one above the other and separated\r\nby sixty feet of shale, had been swept clean for about three feet, so\r\nthat I found an easy pathway for my feet, when after laborious climbing\r\nI reached the lower ledge. From my lofty perch I had a bird’s-eye view\r\nof mile upon mile of the wonderful Bad Lands, a scene of desolation such\r\nas no pen can picture.\r\n\r\nIt was my duty to search every square inch of the dust-covered slope\r\nbetween the ledges for fossil bones. After much unsuccessful effort, I\r\ncame to a place at the head of a gorge, where a perpendicular escarpment\r\ndropped downward for a thousand feet. The upper ledge of sandstone had\r\nbroken loose for a space of thirty feet, and this huge mass of rock,\r\nfour feet thick, carrying with it the loose dirt and polishing the\r\nunderlying surface as it thundered down the slope, had struck the lower\r\nledge with such force that it too had broken loose and plunged downward\r\ninto the abyss. A grove of pine trees at the base of the cliff had been\r\ncrushed to the earth by this avalanche. To my view the remaining trees,\r\nwhich I knew to be about fifty feet high, appeared like seedlings, and\r\nthe vast mass of rock like a cobblestone.\r\n\r\nI concluded that I should have no difficulty in crawling across the\r\nsmooth space, for I reasoned that if I began to slip, I could drive the\r\nsharp end of my pick into the soft rock and thus stop myself. So,\r\nclimbing up the slope through the loose earth to the base of the upper\r\nledge, I started to cross. When I was halfway over I began to slip, and\r\nconfidently raising my pick, struck the rock with all my might. God\r\ngrant that I may never again feel such horror as I felt then, when the\r\npick, upon which I had depended for safety, rebounded as if it had been\r\npolished steel, as useless in my hands as a bit of straw. I struck\r\nfrantically again and yet again, but all the time I was sliding down\r\nwith ever-increasing rapidity toward the edge of the abyss, safety on\r\neither side and certain and awful death below.\r\n\r\nI remember that I gave up all hope of escape, and that after the first\r\nshock I felt no fear of death; but the few moments of my slide seemed\r\nhours, measured by the rapidity with which my mind worked. Everything,\r\nit seemed to me, that I had ever done or thought spread itself out\r\nbefore my mind’s eye as vividly as the wonderful panorama of the cliffs\r\nand canyons upon which I had been gazing a few moments before. All the\r\nscenes of my life, from childhood up, were re-enacted here with the same\r\nemotions of pleasure or pain. I saw distinctly the people I had known,\r\nmany of them long forgotten. My mother seemed to stand out more\r\nprominently than anyone else, and I wondered what she would think when\r\nshe heard that I had been dashed to pieces. I even planned how, when I\r\ndid not return to camp, Cope would set out to find me, following my\r\nfootsteps into the loose dirt until he reached the slide, and I wondered\r\nhow he would ever get down into the canyon, and how much of my body\r\nwould be left for burial.\r\n\r\nTo this day I do not know how I escaped. I suddenly found myself lying\r\non the ledge, on the side I had left a moment before. Probably some part\r\nof my clothing, covered with dust as it was, had acted as a brake upon\r\nthe polished surface. I lay for an hour with trembling knees, too weak\r\nto make my way back to camp.\r\n\r\nThis experience of mine is another instance of the fact that the human\r\nbrain forgets nothing, and will yield up everything when the right kind\r\nof stimulus is applied.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of our work and the danger with it seemed to make us\r\nreckless of life, Professor Cope even more so than the rest of us,\r\nalthough he was at that time United States Paleontologist, and worth a\r\nmillion dollars. I remember one night he was following a buffalo trail\r\nto the river, when suddenly his horse stopped and refused to go further.\r\nWithout dismounting to find out the cause, he plunged his spurs into the\r\nanimal, and it sprang into the air. Mr. Isaac, who was behind, followed.\r\nThe next day they were surprised to find that they had crossed a gorge\r\nten feet wide, and that but for the keen sight and the strength of their\r\nhorses, they would have been dashed to pieces a hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nCope’s indefatigability, too, was a constant source of wonder to us. We\r\nwere in excellent training, after our strenuous outdoor life in the\r\nKansas chalk beds, while he had just been working fourteen hours a day\r\nin his study and the lithographer’s shop, completing a large Government\r\nmonograph, writing his own manuscript, and reading his own proof. When\r\nwe first met him at Omaha, he was so weak that he reeled from side to\r\nside as he walked; yet here he climbed the highest cliffs and walked\r\nalong the most dangerous ledges, working without intermission from\r\ndaylight until dark.\r\n\r\nEvery night when we returned to camp, we found that the cook had spent\r\nthe whole day in cooking. Exhausted and thirsty,—we had no water to\r\ndrink during the day (all the water in the Bad Lands being like a dense\r\nsolution of Epsom salts),—we sat down to a supper of cakes and pies and\r\nother palatable, but indigestible food. Then, when we went to bed, the\r\nProfessor would soon have a severe attack of nightmare. Every animal of\r\nwhich we had found traces during the day played with him at night,\r\ntossing him into the air, kicking him, trampling upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen I waked him, he would thank me cordially and lie down to another\r\nattack. Sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting\r\nslumber. But the next morning he would lead the party, and be the last\r\nto give up at night. I have never known a more wonderful example of the\r\nwill’s power over the body.\r\n\r\nHis memory and his imagination, too, were extraordinary. He used to talk\r\nto me by the hour, arranging the living and dead animals of the earth in\r\nsystematic order, giving countless scientific names and their\r\ndefinitions. I forgot the names as soon as I heard them, but the loving\r\ntribute which he paid to the wonders of creation has had a lasting and\r\nhelpful effect upon me. If I ever had any feelings of disgust or fear\r\ntoward any of God’s creatures, I lost them upon a knowledge of the\r\nanimals as revealed to me by this master naturalist, who saw beauty even\r\nin lizards and snakes. He believed, and taught me to believe, that it is\r\na crime to destroy life wantonly, any life. Of course the first law of\r\nnature is self-preservation; we must, in order to live, kill our enemies\r\nand protect our friends; but this superstitious fear which men and, even\r\nmore, women have of snakes, lizards, and bugs, how cruel it is! Why\r\nshould they rejoice when some poor little garter-snake, which has gone\r\nas a friend into the cellar walk to destroy rats and mice, is dragged\r\nout and cut to pieces? My heart bleeds when I think of the brutal way in\r\nwhich people take life, something they can never give back, and with the\r\ngreat Cope, I cry out against this crime, which is exterminating some of\r\nour most beautiful and useful friends. No man can say he loves us, when\r\nhe wantonly destroys our work; no man loves God who wantonly destroys\r\nHis creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—_a_, LOWER JAW OF _Trachodon marginatus_, SHOWING SUCCESSIVE\r\n    LAYERS OF TEETH. _b_, TOP AND SIDE VIEWS OF A TOOTH OF _Myledaphus\r\n    bipartitus_.\r\n\r\n  (After Osborn and Lambe.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—SKULL OF A DUCK-BILLED DINOSAUR, _Diclonius_, FOUR FEET IN\r\n    LENGTH.

Photo, by Matthew.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe found no complete specimens of any fossil animals during our stay on\r\nDog Creek, but near the summit of the Bad Lands, under beds of yellowish\r\nsandstone, we came upon localities literally filled with the scattered\r\nbones and teeth of dinosaurs, those terrible lizards whose tread once\r\nshook the earth. They are represented now by the little horned toad of\r\ncentral Kansas. Among the fragments were pieces of the finely-sculptured\r\nshells of the sea turtles, _Trionyx_ and _Adocus_, and remains of that\r\nstrange dinosaur _Trachodon_ (Fig. 13_a_), whose teeth were arranged as\r\nin a magazine, one below another, so that when the old teeth wore out,\r\nothers were ever ready to take their place.\r\n\r\nThe specimen in the illustration is from Drs. Osborn and Lambe’s\r\nContribution to Canadian Paleontology, on the Vertebrata of the\r\nMid-Cretaceous of the Northwest Territory (1902). The splendid\r\nCretaceous dinosaur here illustrated is from Wyoming (Fig. 14). This\r\nlast form was restored by the late Professor Marsh, and is now mounted\r\nin the museum of Yale University. What a strange picture it presents,\r\nthis great plant-eater, as, standing on its hind limbs, its powerful\r\ntail acting as the third leg of a tripod, it grasps the branches of a\r\ntree with its weak hands and arms, while its teeth scrape off the tender\r\nleaves!\r\n\r\nIn one of these localities we found teeth belonging to some extinct\r\nray-like fish that were arranged in the roof and floor of the mouth like\r\nbricks in a pavement, forming a sort of mill which ground up the shells\r\nupon which the creature subsisted. A strange thing about these teeth was\r\nthat one side of the enamel was white and the other black. Cope called\r\nthe species _Myledaphus bipartitus_ (Fig. 13_b_).\r\n\r\nThe diamond-shaped enameled scales of the _Lepidotus_, an ancient\r\nrelative of the gar-pike, were very common, as were also the teeth of\r\nseveral species of dinosaurs besides those already mentioned.\r\n\r\nTo-day the great museums of the country have complete or nearly complete\r\nskeletons of these creatures, the largest land animals that ever\r\ninhabited the earth. The splendid specimen of _Brontosaurus_ (Fig. 16)\r\nin the American Museum at New York is over sixty feet long. Nothing so\r\nfires the imagination as a visit to the halls where these ancient\r\nlizards now stand.\r\n\r\nI am delighted that recent authorities, Drs. Osborn and Lambe, have\r\ngiven Professor Cope credit for these discoveries of his in 1876,\r\ndiscoveries which are made the more memorable by the fact that he was\r\nthe first scientist who had the foresight and the courage to explore\r\nthese fossil beds after Dr. Hayden, their original discoverer, was\r\ndriven out of the region by Blackfeet Indians. Indeed, the chief purpose\r\nof this chapter is to put forward the claim that Professor Cope, Mr.\r\nIsaac, and myself made the first real collection of these wonderful\r\nsaurians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—PROFESSOR E. D. COPE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—BRONTOSAURUS OR THUNDER LIZARD.\r\n\r\n  Restoration by Osborn and Knight. (From painting in American Museum of\r\n    Natural History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying himself that there were no skeletons more or less\r\ncomplete on Dog Creek, Cope took the guide and went off down the river\r\nto Cow Island, forty miles below. This point was the head of navigation\r\non the Missouri in October, the water then being so low that the\r\nsteamboat could not get up to Fort Benton. The last boat came up on the\r\nfifteenth of October, to carry a load of ore and passengers down to the\r\nrailroad at Omaha, and as the Professor had decided to take this boat,\r\nit was necessary for him to be on hand when it arrived.\r\n\r\nA few days later he sent word to us on Dog Creek to break camp and\r\nproceed, according to the scout’s directions, to Cow Island with all the\r\noutfit. This was no easy task; in fact, at first sight it appeared\r\nimpossible. No wagon had ever before rolled down those steep hillsides.\r\nMr. Isaac, however, took command, and, after removing everything from\r\nthe wagon except the Professor’s trunk, which could neither be packed on\r\na horse nor carried by hand, we began our journey up the long twelve\r\nhundred feet to the prairies above.\r\n\r\nWorking with axes, picks, and shovels, we cut trees, bridged chasms, and\r\nmade roads, climbing upward step by step, until in the afternoon we\r\nreached what for the moment threatened to be the end of our journey.\r\nBefore us rose the sloping side of a ridge, covered entirely with loose\r\nshale, and so steep that it was impossible to climb it even on horseback\r\nwithout making a long diagonal across its flank. At the summit the ridge\r\nwas narrow enough to be straddled by a wagon, and it sloped down at the\r\nsame angle on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe teamster refused to go any further, and this angered Isaac, who said\r\nthat he would drive himself. So he unhitched the lead horses, and\r\nclimbing the wagon, urged on the stupid mustangs. One walked in a trail\r\nthat we had made, the other in the loose dirt below.\r\n\r\nI was a good deal concerned as to the fate of both man and team, but\r\nexperience had taught me the folly of arguing with an angry man; so I\r\nsat on my horse and waited for the outcome. Isaac had driven about\r\nthirty feet above the level floor, when the inevitable happened. I saw\r\nthe wagon slowly begin to tip, pulling the ponies over sideways, and\r\nthen the whole outfit, wagon and horses, began to roll down the slope.\r\nWhenever the wheels stuck up in the air, the ponies drew in their feet\r\nto their bellies, and at the next turn, stretched out their legs for\r\nanother roll.\r\n\r\nMy heart was in my mouth for fear that Isaac would be killed in one of\r\nthe turns, or that wagon and all would roll over a thousand-foot\r\nprecipice below, but after three complete turns, they landed, the horses\r\non their feet, the wagon on its wheels, on a level ledge of sandstone,\r\nand stood there as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that Isaac was safe, I could not help laughing, and in\r\nconsequence was told that if I was so smart I could get up the slope\r\nmyself. I quickly gave orders that the picket ropes be tied together and\r\nfastened to the hind axle of the wagon, and that the horses be led\r\nsingly up the trail. The rope was then carried to the top of the ridge,\r\nand the horses were hitched to it, and driven down the steep slope on\r\nthe opposite side, thus drawing up the wagon. We then righted it so that\r\nit straddled the ridge and could be safely hauled out to the level\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nAfter this we had to go back on horses and bring the camp outfit, which\r\nwe had left at Dog Creek, to the wagon.\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock that afternoon our scout, who had not showed up\r\nduring the heavy labor of getting the outfit up to the prairie, was seen\r\ncoming from the south through a break in the foothills, while at the\r\nsame time another horseman approached at full speed from the east. At a\r\nsign from the scout, our driver stopped his horses, and Isaac and I\r\nrested in our saddles.\r\n\r\nThe second horseman soon proved to be Professor Cope, who galloped up to\r\nthe guide and stopped him, the gestures of the two men and the sound of\r\ntheir raised voices indicating that an animated argument was going on\r\nbetween them. Finally the scout, his face heated and scowling, came up\r\nto the wagon, and without a word, got out his roll of blankets and extra\r\nclothing, and started off in the direction of Fort Benton.\r\n\r\nThe cook shouted after him, and then, springing from the wagon, followed\r\nhim. When they were out of earshot, the scout stopped, and the two began\r\nan excited conversation. Then it was the cook’s turn to show of what\r\npoor stuff he was made, for, coming back to the wagon, he loaded his\r\nblankets and grip on his broad shoulders, and struck out on foot for a\r\nwood-camp a few miles to the north, on the river.\r\n\r\nWhen Cope came up he told us that these two men, whom he had paid in\r\nfull for three months’ work, had deserted him here on the open prairie,\r\na hundred and twenty miles from his base of supplies.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the scout had come across Sitting Bull’s war camp, where\r\nthousands of warriors, drunk with the blood of Custer and the brave men\r\nof the Seventh U. S. Cavalry, were defying the Government in the\r\ninaccessible canyons around the Dry Fork of the Missouri. The camp was\r\nonly a day’s journey from us, and the scout and our valiant cook had\r\nconcluded that their precious scalps were too valuable to risk.\r\n\r\nThe Professor asked us whether we could carry on the double work which\r\ntheir dishonorable conduct had made necessary, and we willingly\r\nundertook to do so, even if it were to mean working our fingers to the\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nIsaac took the seat, and we prepared to start on, but misfortunes never\r\ncome singly. Our four-year-old colt, who had had a chance to rest during\r\nthe delay, suddenly decided that he too would try to put a stop to the\r\nexpedition. He balked, and when the Professor went up to him to lead him\r\nalong, he struck out viciously with his fore feet.\r\n\r\nNow I imagine that the Professor had put up with about all that he was\r\nwilling to bear. The cowardly desertion of our men, combined with the\r\ndiscomforts of our situation,—we had had nothing to eat or drink since\r\nwe left Dog Creek, and the only spring on the route at which we could\r\nget good water was miles away,—left little mercy in his heart for this\r\nmiserable, obstinate horse. He told Isaac to unhitch the animal and tie\r\nhim to a hind wheel, while I got on top of the wagon, armed with a club\r\nto prevent his trying to climb in.\r\n\r\nWith the whip in one hand, butt end down, Cope approached the horse with\r\nthe other outstretched, speaking gently to conciliate him. The horse,\r\nhowever, struck out with all his might. Narrowly escaping the blow, the\r\nProfessor stepped back, raised the whip, and with the butt end, hit the\r\nhorse behind the ear. The animal fell like a flash, and lay for some\r\ntime stunned; but when he struggled to his feet, and the Professor\r\napproached him again with outstretched hand and soft words, the brute\r\nstruck again. Again Cope knocked him down, and, although when he rose to\r\nhis feet, he made another feeble attempt to strike, a third knock-down\r\nblow was enough for him. After that he welcomed the Professor’s\r\nadvances, accepting with every symptom of pleasure the caresses bestowed\r\nupon him, and when untied, he almost dragged Cope after him in his\r\nanxiety to get to his traces. We had no more trouble with him until a\r\nlong rest and plenty of food caused him to forget his punishment, and\r\nmade a repetition of it necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late that night, after fourteen hours of strenuous\r\nlabor, that we were able to eat our supper of bacon and hardtack, and\r\nlie down for a few hours’ rest. We slung our food from a tree to get it\r\nout of the reach of any grizzlies which might come straying around in\r\nsearch of bread crumbs or bacon rinds. We expected any moment to be\r\nrolled out of bed by some prowling paw.\r\n\r\nThe next day we traveled along through the great level stretches that\r\nskirt the Bad Lands. The prairie was covered with thick bunches of\r\ngrass, and often had been rooted up for acres by grizzlies in search of\r\nwild artichokes, a sweet morsel they love. We often saw herds of deer\r\nand elk and antelope.\r\n\r\nPart of the time our route lay among the foothills of the Judith River\r\nMountains to the south of us; and when we emerged again on to the open\r\nplain, we found ourselves in a great amphitheater, a hundred miles\r\nacross. To the west the towering ranges of the Rockies rose in silent\r\ngrandeur, their sides scarred deeply with canyons, in whose recesses the\r\nwhite snow gleamed and sparkled in the morning light To the south, east,\r\nand north, the Judith River Mountains, the Little Rockies, Medicine Bow,\r\nBearpaw, and the Sweet Grass Mountains on the border line of Assiniboia\r\nmade up the circle. A glorious scene! And there was exhilaration too in\r\nthe thought that ours was the first wagon to roll through these rich\r\nsolitudes, given up for ages to the red hunter and his game. These hills\r\nwere soon to re-echo with the shriek of the locomotive, and this rich\r\nsoil to nourish a thousand souls, but in the days I am recalling, we did\r\nnot meet a single human being in all the forty miles of our journey.\r\n\r\nThat night, after another hard day, we halted at the head of a short and\r\nvery steep ravine ending in an open valley between two ridges, whose\r\nlofty precipices abutted on the Missouri twelve hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nThis valley, Cope told us, was to be our camping ground for some time to\r\ncome, as a steamboat snubbing-post was situated here. When I learned\r\nthis, I threw out my roll of blankets and started it on its way to camp.\r\nIt bounded down the ravine, leaping high in the air from boulder to\r\nboulder, and never stopped until it was caught in a bunch of the cactus\r\nthat covered the level plain below.\r\n\r\nEverything but the Professor’s trunk was unloaded, and the wagon pulled\r\nto the head of the gulch, where Isaac took charge of the tongue, and the\r\nProfessor and I, each tying a picket rope to the hind axle and making a\r\nhalf-hitch to a convenient sapling, let the wagon slowly down the hill.\r\nWhen the rope was paid out, Isaac blocked the wheels with stones, and we\r\nadvanced for another hitch, continuing in this way until we reached the\r\nbottom. The baggage was then packed down, and, after a space had been\r\ncleared of cactus, our tent was pitched. It was not until long after\r\nmidnight that we sat down to cook our meal, and when we rolled into our\r\nblankets we slept the sleep of utter exhaustion.\r\n\r\nNot only during this trip, but all through our stay in the Bad Lands, we\r\nwere tormented by myriads of black gnats, which got under our hat rims\r\nand shirt sleeves, and produced sores that gave rise to pus and thick\r\nscabs. They got under the saddles and girths too, irritating the horses\r\nalmost beyond endurance. We were forced, for lack of something better,\r\nto cover our faces and arms with bacon grease and to rub the skins of\r\nthe horses under the collars and saddles with the same disagreeable\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nFossil bones always partake of the characteristics of the rock in which\r\nthey are entombed, and here they were quite hard when we got in to where\r\nthe rock was compact. The Professor found here the first specimen ever\r\ndiscovered in America of the wonderful horned dinosaurs; _Monoclonius_\r\nhe called the first species. I assisted him in digging out his specimen\r\nof _M. crassus_, a species distinguished by a small horn over each\r\norbit, and a large one on the nasal bones; and I myself discovered two\r\nspecies new to science. One of these, an _M. sphenocerus_, was six or\r\nseven feet high at the hips, and, according to Cope, must have been\r\ntwenty-five feet long, including the tail. It has a long compressed\r\nnasal horn, and two small horns over the eyes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh later discovered a similar form in these same fossil\r\nbeds, and named it _Ceratops montanus_.\r\n\r\nThe species I discovered were collected on the north side of the river,\r\nthree miles below Cow Island, after the Professor had taken the last\r\nboat down the river. When we uncovered these bones we found them very\r\nbrittle, as they had been shattered by the uplift of the strata in which\r\nthey were buried; and we were obliged to devise some means of holding\r\nthem in place. The only thing we had in camp that could be made into a\r\npaste was rice, which we had brought along for food. We boiled\r\nquantities of it until it became thick, then, dipping into it flour bags\r\nand pieces of cotton cloth and burlap, we used them to strengthen the\r\nbones and hold them together. This was the beginning of a long line of\r\nexperiments, which culminated in the recently adopted method of taking\r\nup large fossils by bandaging them with strips of cloth dipped in\r\nplaster of Paris, like the bandages in which a modern surgeon encases a\r\nbroken limb.\r\n\r\nI feel it a great privilege to have been one of the original discoverers\r\nof these great horned dinosaurs, whose skeletons are now among the chief\r\nglories of our museums.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day, about the fifteenth of October, Professor Cope, who had been\r\nanxiously awaiting the arrival of the last steamboat, concluded to ride\r\nout on the open prairie to some bad lands which we had seen on our\r\njourney down from Dog Creek. I accompanied him. On the way he fell into\r\none of his frequent absent-minded moods, picturing the land as it must\r\nhave been at the time of the dinosaurs, when the shale of these\r\nblack-sided canyons was mud on an ocean floor. So fascinated were we\r\nboth by his descriptions that the time flew by unheeded, and it was\r\nafternoon before we reached the prairie south of Cow Island.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the bit of bad lands, we separated, agreeing to meet at\r\nfour o’clock at the place where we left the horses. I kept the\r\nappointment, but the Professor was nowhere to be seen, and as hour after\r\nhour passed with no sign of him, I began to grow anxious. I knew the\r\nfoolishness of trying to find him in that network of gorges and ridges,\r\nand could only wait, eagerly watching the outlets of the labyrinth.\r\n\r\nJust as the sun was sinking behind the Rockies he came out of a narrow\r\nravine with the head of a large mountain sheep on his back. He gave it\r\nto me to carry behind my saddle, and with few words we mounted and set\r\noff at full speed for home, remembering the three men whom we had met on\r\nthe prairie at noon, who had been lost for three days in the intricate\r\npassages of the Bad Lands. I did not like to think of trying to find the\r\nway there after night.\r\n\r\nThe Professor dashed over the prairie without once drawing rein,\r\nclearing bunches of cactus ten feet, sometimes, in diameter, at a single\r\nbound; and I followed suit. So, by a series of leaps, we crossed the\r\nten-mile stretch and drew up at the head of a gorge, from which we could\r\nsee Cow Island.\r\n\r\nCope eagerly scanned the lights of the little station, and finally\r\ndecided that a new set had been added to those of the soldiers’ tents.\r\nHe was sure that the long-expected steamer lay at her snubbing-post, and\r\ndeclared emphatically that we must reach Cow Island that night.\r\n\r\nI knew the uselessness of trying to combat his iron will, but I pleaded\r\nwith him against the folly of attempting to thread in the darkness those\r\nblack and treacherous defiles, where a single misstep meant certain\r\ndeath. I begged him to wait until daylight. We were, to be sure, hungry\r\nand thirsty, and food, water, and shelter were to be had only at the\r\nriver, but sleeping in our saddle blankets without supper was, I urged,\r\npreferable to running the risk of being dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention to what I said, but dismounting, led his horse into\r\nthe canyon. He had to cut a stick to shove in front of him, as his eyes\r\ncould not penetrate the darkness a single inch ahead. I cut another to\r\npunch along his horse, which did not want to follow him.\r\n\r\nSometimes when we had climbed down several hundred feet, the end of the\r\nProfessor’s stick would encounter only air, and a handful of stones\r\nthrown ahead would be heard to strike the earth far below. Then we had\r\nto turn and climb back through the deep dust to the top, and circling a\r\ncanyon, plunge down on the other side.\r\n\r\nOnce we got down to the river four miles from the prairie, and thought\r\nthat our journey was over, as we could see the lights of the station\r\njust across the river. But when we had watered our thirsty horses and\r\nstarted down for the landing, we found our way blocked by a huge ridge\r\nwith a towering precipice impinging on the river; and we had to drag\r\nourselves back over those four long, hard miles to the prairie, and\r\nstart again. I freely confess that I should have been willing to lie\r\ndown in the dust just where I was, and let the horses look out for\r\nthemselves, but Cope’s indomitable will could not be conquered. Back we\r\nclimbed to the top, and down we went into the next ravine.\r\n\r\nI have never known another man who would have attempted this journey. It\r\nwas both foolhardy and useless, but we could say that we accomplished\r\nwhat no one else ever had in reaching Cow Island through the Bad Lands\r\nafter dark.\r\n\r\nFor we did reach it. Just before daylight we got down to the landing\r\nacross from the station, and sure enough, the steamboat was at her post.\r\nBut another disappointment was in store for us. The Professor shouted to\r\nthe sergeant to come and take us over, but his voice was not recognized,\r\nand as the sergeant was afraid that the call might come from some Indian\r\nwho had prepared an ambush, he refused to respond. We were soaked with\r\nperspiration, and rapidly becoming chilled by a cold fog that was rising\r\nalong the shore, and we were obliged to walk back and forth to keep warm\r\nuntil the Professor had recovered his natural voice.\r\n\r\nThen, in his haste to correct his error, the sergeant sent a boat across\r\nin the wrong place, and it was turned over in the rapids. He had to\r\nrescue the half-drowned men, capture the boat, and try again.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, we were warming ourselves in a tent, where a pot of\r\nbeans was simmering for the soldiers’ breakfast. Not a bean was left\r\nwhen we got through with them, and three pounds of raspberry jam, spread\r\nupon, I was going to say a box of, hardtack, followed the beans. Then\r\nthe sergeant took us both out into the open air and turned back the big\r\nblack tarpaulin covering the gold ore that was to be shipped to the\r\nsmelter at Omaha. He made us a warm nest of new blankets, and when we\r\nhad crawled into it, pulled the tarpaulin back into place. Did we sleep?\r\nAsk the deckhands who let the sunlight in upon us about nine o’clock the\r\nnext morning, when they pulled away the tarpaulin to load the ore.\r\n\r\nCope at once sought the captain of the boat and said, “I am Professor\r\nCope, of Philadelphia. I have a four-horse wagon at a steamboat\r\nsnubbing-post three miles below. I would like you to stop there on your\r\nway down, and carry my outfit across to this side. My baggage and\r\nfreight are also there, and I want to take passage for Omaha.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” the man answered, “I am the captain of this boat. If you\r\nwant to go down the river, you must have your baggage, freight, and self\r\nat this landing before ten o’clock to-morrow morning, when I leave for\r\ndown-river points.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor did not argue the question further. He tried to get the\r\nloan of an old sand-scow, but the man who owned it had heard this\r\nconversation with the captain, and refused to lend it. The Professor was\r\nobliged to purchase it for an enormous price, and the next day left it\r\nwhere he got it. We boarded this scow, and leaving our ponies picketed\r\nacross the river, paddled down to camp, where, to our disgust, we found\r\nthat Mr. Isaac had gone out into the Bad Lands to look for us. There was\r\nno time to lose; so, although stiff and sore from our night’s exertions,\r\nwe plunged into the work of lowering the tent, packing our stores and\r\nfossils into the wagon, and dragging everything aboard the scow. We were\r\nready to start when Mr. Isaac appeared.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the river, swimming our horses; and then came the time for\r\nold Major to go it alone and show his worth. We converted the Missouri\r\ninto a canal, and its northern bank into a towpath. Old Major we hitched\r\nto a line attached to the scow; and while a couple of mountain men whom\r\nwe had in camp kept the boat away from the shore with long poles, I rode\r\nthe big horse, often right into the river, until he began to sink in a\r\nmud bank, and I had to turn hastily back to shore. The Professor and Mr.\r\nIsaac had the worst places, for they had to keep the rope from being\r\ncaught by a snag or rock; and when it did catch, if they did not\r\ninstantly loose their hold upon it, the tension threw them far over into\r\nthe river, and they had to get out as best they could. This occurred a\r\nnumber of times.\r\n\r\nWhen about sundown we hove-to under the big steamer, the deck was\r\ncrowded with passengers watching our approach. Cope was covered with mud\r\nfrom head to foot, and his clothing, with hardly a seam whole, hung from\r\nhim in wet, dirty rags. He had forgotten to bring along any winter\r\nwearing apparel, so, although the nights were quite cold, and the women\r\nwere clad in fur coats and the men in ulsters, he emerged from the\r\nsergeant’s tent, whither he had carried his grip, in a summer suit and\r\nlinen duster.\r\n\r\nHe told me about a funny experience that he had on the boat on the way\r\ndown the river. It goes without saying that in that long trip he taught\r\nthe passengers more natural science than they had ever learned in all\r\ntheir lives before. At a certain wood-camp, he and some others went\r\nashore and found the skull of a Crow Indian. The Crow method of burial\r\nwas to wrap the body in a blanket, lay it on the ground, and build\r\naround it an open frame of logs, to keep away wild animals. It was an\r\neasy matter to pick up a skull.\r\n\r\nThe Professor carried his find aboard in his hands before everyone, and\r\nwas beginning to tell his enlightened listeners the special cranial\r\ncharacteristics of this tribe, when a body of deckhands, headed by their\r\nappointed speaker, came forward and told the captain that they would not\r\nallow Professor Cope to “emulate the dead.” He must take the skull back\r\nto its grave or they would not remain aboard and take the boat down to\r\nOmaha.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the speaker earnestly, “we will be caught on every mud bank\r\nin the river, and there is no telling what calamities will happen, if he\r\nis allowed to emulate the dead.”\r\n\r\nThere was no getting them to back down from their position, and the\r\nCrow’s skull was restored to its grave. But the Professor said\r\nafterwards, “We had about a dozen skulls packed in with the fossils, and\r\nin spite of them, reached Omaha without having to walk on stilts, as had\r\nbeen prophesied.”\r\n\r\nShortly after the Professor left us, I discovered a fine specimen, one\r\nof those mentioned earlier in this chapter, three miles below Cow\r\nIsland, near the base of a high tableland, where I kept my pony picketed\r\nwhile I worked. One day, when I prepared to mount him, I noticed that he\r\nwas unusually quiet. His custom was to start on a run as soon as my foot\r\ntouched the stirrup, leaving me to get into the saddle as best I could.\r\nThis time he stood still, and when I reached my seat and lifted the\r\nlines, I found that they were perfectly useless, as the curb was broken.\r\n\r\nBefore I could dismount, the brute started at a rapid pace across the\r\ntableland toward a sheer precipice, hundreds of feet high. I settled\r\nmyself firmly in the saddle and hung on with both hands to the\r\nhand-holds behind, fearing that he might try to hurl me over; and that\r\nwas just what he did. When he got within a few inches of the brink, he\r\nplanted his feet and stopped suddenly. But Providence and long practice\r\nin riding all kinds of horses enabled me to keep my seat, and\r\nfortunately, the saddle girths held.\r\n\r\nI was just about to dismount, when suddenly the determined animal\r\nwhirled around and started for the precipice on the other side, where he\r\nwent through the same performance. And not satisfied even then, tried\r\nthe trick a third time. Then he allowed me to dismount and mend the\r\ncurb. In payment for his treachery, I forced him to run at full speed\r\ndown the steep and rugged trail to camp.\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been largely taken up with adventures and a study of\r\nthe man Cope; but as a matter of fact, there was little else to tell\r\nabout, as we were in such haste that we secured few specimens, and the\r\nmost important result of the expedition was our discovery of many new\r\nspecimens of dinosaurs, represented chiefly by teeth.\r\n\r\nOn the first of November a heavy snowstorm set in, promising to leave\r\nthe country covered with snow for the winter; so we loaded our outfit\r\nand started for Fort Benton. The sergeant went with us, very\r\nfortunately, as it proved; for one night, as we were camping in the Bear\r\nPaw Mountains, one of our crazy mustang wheelers heard a wolf howl and\r\nstarted on a run for one of the other horses which was picketed farther\r\ndown the slope. Coming suddenly to the end of its rope, its feet\r\nslipped, and it fell and broke its neck. But for the sergeant’s horse we\r\ncould not have hauled in our load.\r\n\r\nCountless herds of buffalo were being driven to the Bad Lands by the\r\nstorm, as were also great droves of deer, elk, and antelope. It seemed\r\nas if it would be impossible to exterminate them. Yet I learned by the\r\npapers the other day that the last herd of buffalo of any size had been\r\nsold at three hundred dollars a head to the Canadian Government, Uncle\r\nSam being too poor to make the purchase.\r\n\r\nWe reached Fort Benton in safety, learning later that Sitting Bull had\r\ncrossed at Cow Island and killed the soldiers who had been left there. I\r\nnever saw my associate, Mr. Isaac, again, but I know that he discovered\r\nsome fine material the next year.\r\n\r\nI made the return stage journey of six hundred miles in six days.\r\nThrough the mountains the thermometer averaged twenty below zero, and I\r\nate four hearty meals a day. I recrossed the Great Divide on the Union\r\nPacific Railroad, made a brief visit home, and went on to spend the\r\nwinter with Professor Cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                 FURTHER WORK IN THE KANSAS CHALK, 1877\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the winter of 1876–77 with Professor Cope, first at Haddonfield,\r\nthen at his new home on Pine Street, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAt Haddonfield the commodious loft of a large, old-fashioned barn was\r\nfitted up as a workshop, and I had also a bed here. I boarded with a Mr.\r\nGeismar, Professor Cope’s preparator, but I had a standing invitation to\r\neat dinner every Sunday with the Professor and his wife and daughter, a\r\nlovely child of twelve summers.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget those Sunday dinners. The food was plain, but\r\ndaintily cooked, and the Professor’s conversation was a feast in itself.\r\nHe had a wonderful power of putting professional matters from his mind\r\nwhen he left his study, and coming out ready to enter into any kind of\r\nmerrymaking. He used to sit with sparkling eyes, telling story after\r\nstory, while we laughed at his sallies until we could laugh no more.\r\n\r\nI never knew his wit to fail him. I remember being present at a meeting\r\nof the Academy of Science, in Philadelphia, at which he was up for\r\nre-election to the office of recording secretary, and was defeated.\r\nAmong others, Professor William Moore Gabb made some remarks against\r\nhim. Cope’s only defense was “Now, William, more gab!”\r\n\r\nI attended also the dinners which he gave to his hosts of friends in the\r\ncity, and the luncheons at which Mrs. Cope entertained the young men to\r\nwhom the Professor gave lectures in his own home. He told his funniest\r\nanecdotes on these occasions, and used to call on me for my story of the\r\nold farmer who, while at work hoeing corn in a stump-field on the side\r\nof a hill, saw a hoop-snake at the top take its tail in its mouth and\r\nbegin to roll down towards him. Springing behind a stump, he struck at\r\nit with his hoe handle, into which the sting at the end of the snake’s\r\ntail entered deeply. In less than an hour the handle had swelled up to\r\nthe size of a man’s leg.\r\n\r\nI believe that this story-telling of which he was so fond was for Cope a\r\nform of relaxation from his heavy work in the study, and that his\r\nability to give himself up so thoroughly to it in his leisure hours was\r\nwhat enabled him to accomplish in his life an amount of work such as few\r\nmen have ever accomplished. It would take a volume even to name the\r\ntitles of all the products of his industrious brain. One of them alone,\r\nthe great Volume III of the “Tertiary Vertebrata,” often called “Cope’s\r\nBible,” has over a thousand pages of text, beside many fine plates. It\r\nwas published by the Government, in 1884.\r\n\r\nBefore starting back to outfit another expedition to the Kansas Chalk, I\r\nsecured the services of Mr. Russell T. Hill, an able young man who was\r\nworking in the Academy under the Jesup Fund; and upon our arrival at\r\nManhattan, I hired Mr. A. W. Brouse as teamster and cook.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of March we started with a team of ponies and a light\r\nspring wagon upon our long and extremely tedious journey across the\r\nstate of Kansas, to our headquarters at Buffalo Park. At Chapman Creek,\r\na few miles from Junction City, we were stopped by high water. A raging\r\ntorrent twenty feet deep filled the bed of the creek; neither man nor\r\nbeast could have crossed it alive. We were, therefore, horrified to see\r\na farmer, sitting on a seat on top of two sets of side-boards in a\r\nlumber wagon, come driving down into this fearful flood. I called to him\r\nto stop, and asked him what he was going to do.\r\n\r\n“I must come over,” he shouted.\r\n\r\n“Why,” I answered, “the water is twenty feet deep, and running like a\r\nmill race. You’ll be swept away.”\r\n\r\n“But I have not had my mail for a week. I must come over,” he shouted\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “you big fool, why don’t you go down to the railroad\r\nbridge, just below here, and walk over?”\r\n\r\n“By Chimmeny,” he said, “I hadn’t thought of that!”\r\n\r\nAs we were now in the antelope country, we were rarely out of antelope\r\nmeat. One morning we saw a buck antelope standing close to the railroad\r\ntrack, watching an incoming train. I remarked, as I urged the driver to\r\nhurry up his horses, that perhaps someone would shoot the animal from\r\nthe train. And sure enough, as the train passed, a window flew up, and a\r\nman with a revolver shot the buck through the neck. It began to describe\r\na circle, its feet planted together, and springing from the wagon, I cut\r\nits throat with a butcher knife, while the boys held its horns.\r\n\r\nAnother time, as we were traveling along over the prairie, we suddenly\r\ncame upon a young antelope hidden securely in the center of a bunch of\r\ngrass. We should not have seen him at all from the ground, but being\r\nabove him on the wagon seat, we looked right down on him. The boys\r\njumped out, and approaching the little chap carefully, were just\r\nspreading out their arms so as to be ready to grab him, when he sprang\r\nto his feet so quickly that their hands were thrown into the air, and\r\ndarted off. The boys started after him at the top of their speed, but\r\nthey might as well have tried to catch a streak of lightning.\r\n\r\nOne day we were camping at the spring on Hackberry, south of Buffalo,\r\nwhen a couple of men rode up to us. They said that they were cowmen, and\r\nthat they had lost their outfit. I invited them into my tent, and after\r\nsupper gave them the boys’ bed, the boys themselves climbing into the\r\ncovered wagon.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning one of the men wakened me and asked for a revolver.\r\nThere was an antelope in camp, he said. I handed him a Smith and Wesson,\r\nand peeped out, to see a fine buck standing just at the end of the wagon\r\ntongue, looking over the tent and wagon. The stranger opened fire at\r\nthree or four paces and emptied the revolver. Then throwing it down as\r\nof no account, he asked for a gun. I gave him a Sharp’s rifle and a\r\ncartridge belt. In the meanwhile the antelope had walked a few yards\r\naway and turned to look at us. The man fired several shots, and threw\r\ndown the rifle also, and as the boys were by this time climbing out of\r\nthe wagon, one with a Winchester, the other with a little Ballard, he\r\nborrowed from them first one firearm and then the other, and blazed away\r\nwithout once drawing blood. Finally the buck deliberately moved over the\r\nhill and out of sight, while the man swore that it had a charmed life.\r\nWe thought otherwise, however, and the boys followed it; soon returning\r\nwith it swinging from a gun, which they carried on their shoulders like\r\na pole.\r\n\r\nI recall another ludicrous incident connected with this expedition. We\r\nhappened to be at Buffalo Station once when Professor Snow, the\r\nmuch-loved Kansas naturalist, and at one time the chancellor of the\r\nState University, was in town with a large party of students, on his\r\nannual insect hunt.\r\n\r\nThe old Chisholm cattle trail led through Buffalo, and one day the owner\r\nof a large herd of Texas cattle, who was passing through, noticed\r\nProfessor Snow and his party out on the prairie with their nets in their\r\nhands, running about as if possessed. It happened to be the first time\r\nthat he had ever seen insect collectors at work, and his curiosity was\r\naroused.\r\n\r\n“What are those men doing?” he asked Jim Thompson, the storekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Catching bugs,” was the laconic reply.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said the cowman. “They are grown men.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Jim, “you can find out for yourself if you want to.”\r\n\r\nThe man started off after the Professor, and I waited, with a good deal\r\nof curiosity, to hear his report of the conversation. On his return he\r\nwas in a brown study. The Professor had taken him into his tent, and\r\nshown him hundreds of mounted insects, reeling off their names to him\r\nuntil his head whirled.\r\n\r\n“Well, did I tell you the truth?” Jim asked.\r\n\r\n“That man,” said the cowman, “is the smartest man I ever saw. He knows\r\nthe names and surnames of all the bugs in this country.”\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of April we drove down to the Smoky, thirty miles south\r\nof Buffalo, and got caught in a quicksand, but managed to save both team\r\nand wagon. We camped at the mouth of a large ravine with plenty of grass\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAll that night it blew a perfect gale. Did you, dear reader, ever try to\r\nsleep in a tent when the wind was high and the canvas flapped about you,\r\nwaking the fear that at any moment the pegs might pull out or a seam\r\npart? Do you know what it is to lie, deafened by thunder and blinded by\r\nlightning, while the rain and sleet dash against the thin covering which\r\nis all that separates you from the fury of the storm? It is not a\r\npleasant experience, and yet in all the years that I have gone camping,\r\nalthough I have expected time and again to find my tent torn to shreds\r\nover my head, my fears have never once been realized. Even in the most\r\nterrible storms my tent has stood securely, and I have escaped without\r\nserious inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn this trip, however, we did have a disagreeable experience. A cold\r\nrain continued for four days, and the tent sprang a leak right over my\r\nbed. Moreover, the buffalo chips were so wet that we could not build a\r\nfire, and had to eat cold food and sleep in wet blankets.\r\n\r\nAmong the difficulties with which we had to contend on this expedition\r\nwas a defective wagon wheel. One day, as we were driving along a slope,\r\nour lower wheel dished out, and dumped us, load and all, to the ground.\r\nUpon examination, we found that the maker had used a hub whose mortises\r\nwere too large for the spokes. The latter had been held in place by\r\nwedges which had been painted over so that they should not be detected.\r\nThe man who sold us the wagon had guaranteed it for a year, but\r\nunfortunately, he lived two hundred miles away. When the necessity\r\narises, however, one can solve any problem somehow; so we took off the\r\ntire, put back the spokes and wedges, heated the tire in a fire of\r\nbuffalo chips, and reset it. We tried to drive carefully after this and\r\navoid sloping places, but it generally happened that when we least\r\nexpected it, we would fall by the wayside. Most aggravating of all, when\r\nwe did take the defective wheel back to the man who guaranteed it, he\r\ngave us another even more unreliable than the first. It is a mystery to\r\nme how manufacturers can play such miserable tricks on their customers.\r\n\r\nWe were much inconvenienced also by the illness of one of our horses. He\r\noften gave out on the open prairie, in one case, I remember, three miles\r\nfrom water. The only vessel we had in which to bring it to camp was a\r\ngallon jug, and it kept one person busy getting enough for our use. We\r\nwere finally obliged to get another horse in place of the sick one; and\r\nour bad luck persisting, hit upon one which had evidently been trained\r\nto the wheel of a coach, for as soon as the last trace had been hitched,\r\nhe was off like a shot. Fortunately, his mate could not run as fast, so\r\nthat they simply went round in a circle, and the boys, watching their\r\nchance, caught hold of the wagon and got aboard.\r\n\r\nThis horse was continually giving us trouble. One day when we were about\r\nto cross Hackberry Creek I went ahead with my pick and struck the dry,\r\ncracked clay of the bed, to see whether it would hold. As I could not\r\nbreak through, I concluded that we could cross safely, and beckoned to\r\nWill Brouse to come on. Whereupon that miserable mustang, taking his bit\r\nbetween his teeth, came down the hill with the load at full speed, and,\r\ndashing onto the hardened clay, broke through into the thick mortar\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe boys, jumping out, managed to get both horses unhitched before they\r\nwent down, and quickly hitched them to the hind axle of the wagon, to\r\nsave the load of fossils which we were hauling to the station. Then\r\nbegan a performance of that tantalizing trick which horses know so well\r\nhow to play. Rowdy would make a rush forward, as if he intended to haul\r\nout the load in a hurry, but the moment he felt the collar press his\r\nneck, he would fall back against the wheel, while his mate went through\r\nthe same performance. So they see-sawed up and down, until I could stand\r\nit no longer, as the wagon was slowly sinking. I took the lines, and\r\nputting all my will-power into the command “Get out of this!” I forced\r\nthem to pull together and haul the wagon out to solid ground. Then when\r\nwe unhitched them, they ran away and scattered singletrees, nuts, and\r\nbolts all over the prairie.\r\n\r\nSouth of the river we found some fine examples of large _Haploscapha_\r\nshells, some of them a foot in diameter. The valves of this shell are\r\nshaped a little like a woman’s bonnet, and the name Conrad gave it,\r\n“_Haploscapha grandis_,” may be freely translated “The great hood.”\r\n(Fig. 17.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—FOSSIL SHELLS, _Haploscapha grandis_.\r\n\r\n  (After Cope.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—CHARLES STERNBERG AND SON TAKING UP A LARGE SLAB OF FOSSILS\r\n    FROM A CHALK BED IN GOVE CO., KANSAS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—CAMP AND WAGON OF THE FOSSIL HUNTERS ON GRASSWOOD CREEK,\r\n    CONVERSE CO., WYOMING.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe found many fish and saurians or mosasaurs also. Very different was\r\nour method of collecting them then from what it is now, for fossil\r\nhunting is as capable of improvement as any other form of human\r\nendeavor. Then we went over, in a few months, all the chalk in western\r\nKansas, which lines the ravines on either side of the Smoky Hill and its\r\nbranches for a hundred miles; now it takes us five years to get over the\r\nsame ground. Then we dug up the bones with a butcher knife or pick, and\r\npacked in flour sacks with dry buffalo grass, which we pulled with our\r\nfingers. Some strange animals were created by Cope and Marsh in those\r\nearly days, when they attempted to restore a creature from the few\r\ndisconnected bones thus carelessly collected. Now we take up great slabs\r\nof the chalk, so that we can show the bones _in situ_, that is, in their\r\noriginal matrix, so that they may be the more easily fitted together in\r\ntheir natural relations with each other.\r\n\r\nWhen, after much careful exploration, we find, sticking out of the edge\r\nof a canyon or wash, the bones of some “ancient mariner” of the old\r\nCretaceous ocean, we first lay bare a floor above the bones by picking\r\naway the rock. Then I, usually stretched at full length on this floor,\r\nwith a crooked awl and a brush, uncover the bones enough to be able to\r\ndetermine how they lie, often keeping up the tedious work for hours.\r\nWhen the position of each bone has been ascertained, my son George, who\r\nfor years has been my chief assistant, and I cut trenches around the\r\nspecimen, and, hewing down the outside rock two or three inches, make a\r\nframe of 2 × 4 lumber, cover the bones with oiled paper, and fill the\r\nframe with plaster. As the fossil rarely lies level, it is necessary to\r\nhave the cover ready to nail on, a board at a time, while the plaster is\r\nbeing poured in. This results in a panel of even thickness, with every\r\nbone in or near its original position, or at least in the position in\r\nwhich it was buried.\r\n\r\nAfter the plaster has hardened comes the difficult labor of digging the\r\nrock away from underneath. One has to lie on one’s left side and work\r\nwith a light pick, using great care, so as to cut away the rock just\r\nenough to allow the frame to come down by its own weight. If force is\r\nused very likely the rock, with its enclosed fossil, will be torn from\r\nthe frame, and the specimen ruined. Afterwards the rock is leveled off\r\neven with the frame, and the bottom nailed on. The case is then placed\r\nin a larger box with excelsior carefully packed around it.\r\n\r\nThe illustration (Fig. 18) shows a huge panel in process of being cut\r\nout. George and I spent two weeks of heavy labor upon another. Luckily,\r\nit was preserved in chalk hard enough to allow of its being lifted\r\nwithout breaking. The slab was about four inches thick, and weighed at\r\nleast six hundred pounds, yet he and I handled it entirely alone,\r\ngetting it boxed and into the wagon ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy old friend, Dr. S. W. Williston, who in the seventies was in charge\r\nof collecting parties for Professor Marsh, and is now a noted authority\r\nin paleontology and professor of that science in the University of\r\nChicago, describes this specimen in his great work on North American\r\nplesiosaurs, a Field Columbian Museum publication. He says: “The\r\nspecimen of _Dolichorhynchops osborni_, herewith described and\r\nillustrated [Fig. 20], was discovered by Mr. George Sternberg, in the\r\nsummer of 1900, and skilfully collected by his father, the veteran\r\ncollector of fossil vertebrates. The specimen was purchased of Mr.\r\nSternberg in the following spring for the University of Kansas, where it\r\nhas been mounted and now is. When received at the museum, the skeleton\r\nwas almost wholly contained in a large slab of soft, yellow chalk, with\r\nall its bones disassociated, and more or less entangled together. The\r\nleft ischium, lying by the side of the maxilla, was protruding from the\r\nsurface, and part of it was lost. The bones of the tail and some of the\r\nsmaller podial bones were removed a distance from the rest of the\r\nskeleton, and were collected separately by Mr. Sternberg. The head was\r\nlying partly upon its left side, and some of the bones of the right side\r\nhad been macerated away. The maxilla indeed had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“The task of removing and mounting the bones has required the labor of\r\nMr. H. T. Martin the larger part of a year, and is as finally mounted,\r\nan example of great labor and skill on his part.... The skeleton, as\r\nmounted, is just ten feet in length. The neck in life must have been\r\nthick and heavy at the base. The trunk was broad; the abdominal region\r\nshort between the girdles; the short tail was thick at its base. The\r\nspecies was named in honor of Professor H. F. Osborn, of Columbia\r\nUniversity.”\r\n\r\nIn his introduction Dr. Williston speaks of the great scientific value\r\nof this specimen of the plesiosaurian family, of which he says:\r\n“Thirty-two species and fifteen genera have been described from the\r\nUnited States, and in not a single instance has there been even a\r\nconsiderable part of the skeleton made known.”\r\n\r\nI am glad that the University of Kansas owns this splendid denizen of\r\nher ancient Cretaceous sea.\r\n\r\nMy collection in the Royal Museum of Munich is said by Dr. H. F. Osborn\r\nto be the finest prepared collection of Kansas Chalk and Texas Permian\r\nvertebrates in the world. A recent letter from my friend Dr. Broili, an\r\nassistant there, says that the collection contains over eighty-five\r\ndistinct species of extinct vertebrates. Among these, there are eighteen\r\nspecies and seven genera new to science. Seven papers have been\r\npublished describing this material, by J. C. Merriam, A. R. Crook,\r\nCharles R. Eastman, F. B. Loomis, F. Broili, L. Neumayer, and L.\r\nStrickler, respectively; and it has been illustrated by forty plates.\r\nThe lamented German paleontologist, Dr. Carl von Zittel, under whom I\r\nserved the Munich museum for several years, wrote me that I had erected\r\nhere “an immemorial monument” to my name.\r\n\r\nHere rests, far from its native shores, the most complete skeleton of\r\nthe Cretaceous shark, _Oxyrhina mantelli_ Agassiz, ever discovered in\r\nany formation. It formed the basis for the inaugural address delivered\r\nby Charles R. Eastman before the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.\r\n\r\nI discovered this specimen while conducting an expedition for Dr. von\r\nZittel. I was entirely alone, and camping on one of the ravines that\r\nscore the southern slope of the Smoky Hill valley, south of Buffalo\r\nPark. I had already found a number of flattened disks, the centra of\r\nfish vertebræ, which Dr. Williston had assured me belonged to a species\r\nof shark, as he had found teeth associated with them. I was delighted,\r\ntherefore, to find here a continuous string of them leading into a low\r\nknoll. I quickly shoveled away the loose chalk and cleaned up the floor,\r\nto find the whole column, nearly twenty in length; while the skull was\r\nrepresented by great plates of cartilaginous bone, containing some two\r\nhundred and fifty teeth from the roof and floor of the mouth. The larger\r\nteeth were over an inch long and covered with a shining, dark-colored\r\nenamel. They were as sharp and polished as in life, and lay in or near\r\ntheir natural positions.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time and, I believe, the only time that so complete a\r\nspecimen of this ancient shark has been discovered. The column and other\r\nsolid parts were composed of cartilaginous matter which usually decays\r\nso easily that it is rarely petrified. I suppose my specimen was old at\r\nthe time of its death, and bony matter had been deposited in the\r\ncartilage. It is not very likely that such a specimen will ever be\r\nduplicated. Dr. Eastman’s study of this skeleton enabled him to make\r\nsynonyms of many species which had been named from teeth alone.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable of my further discoveries in the Kansas chalk\r\nbeds was that of two nearly complete skeletons of that great sea\r\ntortoise, _Protostega gigas_ Cope. The type had already been described\r\nby Professor Cope from a number of disconnected bones which he found\r\nnear Fort Wallace in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—SKELETON OF THE PLESIOSAUR, _Dolichorhynchus osborni_.\r\n\r\n  Discovered by George F. Sternberg and collected by Charles Sternberg.\r\n    After Williston. (Now in the Kansas State University.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—FOSSIL LIMB BONES OF THE GIANT SEA TORTOISE, _Protostega\r\n    gigas_.\r\n\r\n  Collected by Charles Sternberg.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1903 I was so fortunate as to find a practically complete skeleton of\r\n_Protostega gigas_ in normal condition, that is, with the bones all in\r\nor near their original positions. The late Dr. J. B. Hatcher, whose\r\ndeath in the very noonday of his glorious career as a fossil hunter cast\r\na gloom over the world of paleontology, purchased this specimen from me\r\nfor the Carnegie Museum. It has been described in the Memoirs of the\r\nCarnegie Museum by Dr. G. R. Wieland, the authority on extinct turtles,\r\nunder the title “The Osteology of _Protostega_.” He says, on page 289:\r\n“The third of a century which elapsed since Cope’s discovery of\r\n_Protostega gigas_, has not sufficed to bring forth a complete\r\nrestoration of any single individual of these great sea-turtles. How\r\nwelcome then has been the discovery during the last two years by Mr.\r\nCharles Sternberg in the Niobrara Cretaceous of western Kansas, of the\r\nnearly complete specimens of _Protostega gigas_ which permit the present\r\ndescription of the organization of the limbs, the most important of the\r\nparts yet undescribed as well as the very least likely to be recovered\r\nin complete form.” (Fig. 21.)\r\n\r\nThis rare fossil was briefly mentioned by Professor Osborn also in\r\n_Science_ as a “complete skeleton of _Protostega_ which lay on its\r\ndorsal surface with fore limbs stretched out at right angles to the\r\nmedian line of the carapace, measuring six feet between the ungual\r\nphalanges.”\r\n\r\nA second specimen, which I discovered and sold directly to Dr. W. J.\r\nHolland, the director of the Carnegie Museum, is thus described by Dr.\r\nWieland on page 282 of the Memoirs, under the heading “Specimen No.\r\n1421, Carnegie Museum Catalogue of Vertebrates”:\r\n\r\n“This fine fossil is from the Niobrara Cretaceous of Hackberry Creek.”\r\n(I should like to correct this mistake. It was found about three miles\r\nnorthwest of Monument Rocks in a ravine that empties into the Smoky,\r\neast of where Elkader once stood.) “The _ex situ_ portions of the\r\noriginal skeleton, which had weathered out and are secured in more or\r\nless complete condition, include the left humerus, radius, ulna, etc.\r\nThe _in situ_ portion consists of the right anterior part of the\r\nskeleton, and was secured on a single slab of matrix, in which it still\r\nremains intact, as shown in the accompanying drawing by Mr. Prentice,\r\nincluding the lower jaw in oblique inferior view, the skull, the\r\nT-shaped nuchal (plate) and two marginals. It will be seen what\r\nexceedingly satisfactory information is furnished by the present\r\nspecimen as compared with all other examples of _Protostega_ hitherto\r\nfound. Specimen 1420 [my first specimen] is more complete than any other\r\nat present discovered. As originally embedded in its matrix of chalk,\r\nnearly every element was present in an exactly or approximately natural\r\nposition. Unfortunately, the collector of this surprisingly complete\r\nfossil, in an attempt to remove and separate the bones from their\r\noriginal matrix of chalk, mismarked some of them, and also made it\r\nimpossible to either replace more than a few of the marginal elements,\r\nor to determine the outlines of any of the plastral elements. Such work\r\nis difficult enough in well-equipped laboratories. However, none of the\r\nbones of the limbs are broken, and Mr. Sternberg redeemed himself by\r\ndiscovering and securing in such excellent condition No. 1421, as just\r\nrelated.”\r\n\r\nI learn from one of the Museum’s staff that this specimen is to be\r\nmounted this summer of 1908, and placed on exhibition. As long as the\r\nCarnegie Museum stands, this splendid example of the great sea-tortoise\r\nwill be admired by lovers of nature. In shape it is very like the\r\npresent-day turtle of the Mediterranean. Its huge front paddles, with a\r\nspan of ten feet, were armed with horrid claws. The hind ones were\r\nstretched out parallel with the body and used as sculls by this “boatman\r\nof the Cretaceous.”\r\n\r\nAn account of my work in the Kansas Chalk would not be complete without\r\nsome mention of my discovery, in several small localities, of the\r\ncrinoid _Uintacrinus socialis_ Grinell. According to Mr. Frank Springer,\r\nour noted American authority on this subject, only seven localities were\r\nknown in 1901; he did not know of my discoveries. I can bear witness\r\nwith him, though, to the rarity of this species. During the fifteen\r\nyears in which I have gone over the chalk exposures again and again, I\r\ncan remember only three localities of these fossils, the Martin\r\nlocality, another three miles to the east of it, and a third on Butte\r\nCreek near Elkader. The first has yielded the finest specimens among\r\nthose which were described by Mr. Springer in his magnificent treatise\r\non _Uintacrinus_, published by the Museum of Comparative Zoology at\r\nHarvard University.\r\n\r\nLast year, however, my son George found two splendid specimens about\r\nfifty feet apart, further east than they had been discovered before. The\r\nlocality is south of Quinter, in the southern part of Gove County,\r\nthirty-seven miles east of the Martin locality. These two colonies each\r\ncontained about forty calices. As usual, they are flattened out on the\r\nunder side of a calcareous slab about a quarter of an inch thick and\r\nbeveled off as thin as paper at the margins. One slab was sent to the\r\nSenckenberg Museum in Germany, while Mr. Springer secured the other.\r\n\r\nThe calyx, or as we have called it, “the head,” has ten long arms, some\r\nof them about thirty inches long.[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  A restoration of the _Uintacrinus_ is shown in the same illustration\r\n  (Fig. 11_a_) in which the _Clidastes_ is represented.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful globular animals were stemless, and evidently lived in\r\nswarms, as single specimens are never found. According to Mr. Springer,\r\nwhen death overtook one of these swarms, it fell to the bottom, where\r\nthe first individuals were buried in the soft mud and preserved, while\r\nthe others, not being so protected, disintegrated. The limy plates of\r\nthe calices and those of the arms, which were thus mingled together\r\nabove the perfect specimens, became compressed into a hard slab, in the\r\nbottom of which the perfect specimens are firmly impressed.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of these creatures have been discovered in the English\r\nchalk, but they consist only of the disintegrated plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n  DISCOVERY OF THE LOUP FORK BEDS OF KANSAS AND SUBSEQUENT WORK THERE,\r\n                            1877 AND 1882–84\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the first of July, 1877, I received orders to go north to the Loup\r\nFork River in Nebraska to search for vertebrate fossils in beds of the\r\nUpper Miocene, called by Hayden the Loup Fork Group. I happened to meet,\r\nhowever, an old line hunter, Abernathy by name, who had brought into\r\nBuffalo his last load of buffalo hides, and he told me that a little\r\nabove his cabin, on the middle branch of Sappa Creek in Decatur County,\r\nthere was the skull of a mastodon, sticking out of the solid rock.\r\n\r\nAs a visit to his house would not take me far out of my way, I followed\r\nhis lead; and thanks to the observation of this old hunter, who was\r\nscalped in front of his door the next year by a band of hostile Kiowas,\r\nI had the privilege of discovering the rich fossil beds of the Loup Fork\r\nGroup in northwestern Kansas, and found enough to do without crossing\r\ninto Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe whole country north of Buffalo was without human habitation until we\r\nreached the old man’s cabin. On our way there, as we were driving one\r\nsultry day down the long slope to the south branch of the Soloman, we\r\nchanced to look behind us, and as high as the eye could reach, the air\r\nwas as black as midnight with flying dust, dry grass, and buffalo chips.\r\nExperience had taught us what all this meant. Will Brouse laid the whip\r\nto the ponies, but they did not need it. They, too, had taken fright,\r\nand tore down the hill at breakneck speed. On reaching the valley, we\r\ncame upon a perpendicular bluff, over twenty feet high, impinging on the\r\nlevel flat, and Will swung the horses under its protecting shelter. We\r\nsprang out, and while one of us unhitched and tied the horses, the rest\r\ncaught hold of the wagon and held it down. In an instant all was dark,\r\nwhile the rush of a mighty wind swept over us with a terrible roar and\r\npassed on, leaving a calm in its wake. As we followed its trail along\r\nthe river, we found large trees twisted off at the stump or broken to\r\npieces, their branches scattered like straws.\r\n\r\nAbout sundown one evening, the old man pointed out, in a side draw of\r\nthe middle fork of the Sappa, his mastodon. I sprang from the wagon,\r\nshouting, “It’s a monster turtle!” And so it proved to be, a great land\r\nturtle, over thirty inches long, twenty-eight inches wide, and fifteen\r\ninches high; _Testudo orthopygia_ Cope called it. The back of the\r\ncarapace was sticking out of a ledge of grey sandstone. We applied our\r\npicks, and soon had the specimen collected. (Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\nNow began an extremely interesting search for this new fauna in Kansas.\r\nThe rocks in this part of the state usually consist of gray sand\r\ncemented together with washed chalk and soluble silica. The foundation\r\non which these beds were deposited is the Niobrara Group of the\r\nCretaceous. The river beds were cut in this soft lime, and later on the\r\nwash of the land mingled the whiting with the sand and gravel which the\r\nstreams brought down from the mountains. The tops of the hills are\r\ncapped with this conglomerate gray sandstone in ledges many feet in\r\nthickness, and as the materials composing it easily disintegrate, great\r\nmasses of it lie at the bases of the cliffs, resembling old mortar. I\r\ncalled them mortar beds, and the stratigraphers have adopted the name.\r\nIndeed, they are mortar beds not only in name, from a fancied\r\nresemblance to mortar, but in fact, as all the early settlers can\r\ntestify. It was no trouble for them to find beds so soft that the\r\nmaterial could easily be dug out, and when mixed with water and spread\r\nwith trowels over the inside walls of a sod house, it made a very\r\ncomfortable home. When it comes to comfort, the settlers of the\r\nshort-grass country have gained nothing by building frame instead of sod\r\nhouses. The early settler’s sod house was cool in summer and warm in\r\nwinter, and those who live in more modern houses in order to keep up\r\nwith the times will even now speak with regret of the change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—FOSSIL SHELL OF GIANT LAND TURTLE, _Testudo orthopygia_.\r\n\r\n  Discovered by Charles Sternberg in Phillips Co., Kansas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—THE SNAKE-NECKED ELASMOSAURUS, _Elasmosaurus platyurus_.\r\n\r\n  Discovered in the Niobrara Group of the Cretaceous. Restoration by\r\n    Osborn and Knight. (From painting in American Museum of Natural\r\n    History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot only did I secure a number of specimens of these great turtles, so\r\nabundant at this time, but also large quantities of the remains of a\r\nrhinoceros. Cope thought it hornless, and named it _Aphelops megalodus_,\r\nbut since then Hatcher has found that the male bore a loose horn on the\r\nend of the nasal bones.\r\n\r\nI also got specimens of the great inferior tusked mastodon, _Trilophodon\r\ncampester_ Cope. This remarkably primitive mastodon had a lower jaw that\r\nprojected beyond the molar teeth for two feet in a straight line, with a\r\nsocket on either side, containing two powerful tusks that terminated in\r\nchisel points. One specimen, which I discovered in 1882 for the Museum\r\nof Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, had a jaw four feet long, including\r\nthe tusks, which extended eighteen inches beyond the end of the jaw.\r\n\r\nA set of jaws was brought me by my son last fall. It belongs to a new\r\nform of this gigantic pachyderm, which, during the Loup Fork times,\r\ninhabited northwestern Kansas and a vast territory west and northwest as\r\nfar as the John Day basin in eastern Oregon. A remarkable peculiarity of\r\nthis specimen is that the symphysis is greatly elongated and curves\r\ndownward thirteen inches below the level of the alveolus, which bears\r\nthe great molar teeth. This individual was an old animal, as he had shed\r\nhis first dentition and all the premolars and molars of the second\r\nexcept the very last, those which we call wisdom teeth. Even these are\r\nwell worn; so the days of the mastodon’s life must have been numbered\r\neven if he had escaped his enemy, the great saber-toothed tiger, which\r\npreyed on him and the other herbivorous animals of the day.\r\n\r\nThe length of these remarkable jaws is four feet and one inch. The\r\nheight at the condyle, where they connect with the skull, is thirteen\r\nand a half inches; length of molar, nine and a quarter inches; height of\r\ncrown, two and one-half inches; distance between the two molars, four\r\ninches. The sockets for the great inferior tusks are two feet long and\r\nsix inches in diameter, and the huge recurved tusks themselves must have\r\nbeen over four feet long. Only a sight of these peculiar jaws, with\r\ntusks above and below, can give the reader an idea of the formidable\r\nappearance of this early mastodon. By the large size and downward\r\ncurvature of the lower tusks, this mastodon suggests the great\r\n_Dinotherium_ of the Lower Pliocene of Europe. I regret for America’s\r\nsake, but I am glad for the sake of the world, that these jaws of the\r\nlargest mammal ever found in Kansas will find their last resting-place\r\nin the great British Museum, where many of my finest discoveries have\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nAnother splendid set of lower jaws I found in 1905 in the Sternberg\r\nQuarry, of which I shall speak later, for the Royal Museum of Munich,\r\nBavaria. Part of the symphysis was broken off, as were also the inferior\r\ntusks. The length of the jaw as preserved is two feet, six inches and a\r\nhalf, and the height of the condyle, fourteen inches. In the center of\r\nthe grinding surface, the height is nine and a half inches. The length\r\nof the molar is about seven and a half inches, and the width three and a\r\nhalf. This is Professor Cope’s _Trilophodon_.\r\n\r\nWe found near this mastodon many chisel-like tusks that had fallen out\r\nof their respective jaws and lay scattered with the other bones. By\r\ncomparing this specimen with the new species, it will be noticed that\r\nthere is quite a difference in size, though evidently they were about\r\nthe same age, as in both cases all the teeth have been discarded except\r\nthe last molars.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of these animals were kept sharp by the sand that adhered to\r\nthe roots on which they lived. Falling into the pits and valleys between\r\nthe crests of enamel, it scoured away the dentine and cementum, and kept\r\nthe great grinders ever sharp and ready for use. It is a distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of these early mastodons that their tusks have a strip of\r\nenamel along the inside, while the modern elephants’ tusks have only a\r\nvestige of enamel at the extreme tip that is quickly worn off.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable inhabitant of Kansas during the Loup Fork Period was\r\nthe three-toed horse, an animal but little larger than the new-born colt\r\nof an ordinary farm horse, which evidently lived in herds, judging from\r\nthe great quantity of loose teeth that we have found. Its toes were\r\nspreading, which enabled it to walk over bogs and mossy quagmires on the\r\nshores of lakes or rivers, and thus escape the fangs of bloodthirsty\r\ntigers by venturing farther out on the soft ground than they dared to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, while employed by the Agassiz Museum, I found the famous\r\nSternberg Quarry at Long Island on Prairie Dog Creek in Phillips County.\r\nI had been exploring for weeks the region at the head of the branches of\r\nDeer Creek, which spread out in the divide like a fan; but although once\r\nin a while, especially in the neighborhood of Bread Bowl Mound, I had\r\nfound fragments of the bones of Loup Fork animals in the sod, I had not\r\nmet with much success, as the rocks here disintegrate so easily and hold\r\nmoisture so readily that the whole country is covered with grass. There\r\nare thirty-three streams in this county as a result of the immense\r\namount of moisture which accumulates in these sandstone beds and is\r\ncarried to the surface in springs.\r\n\r\nOne very hot day I started to cross the divide to Prairie Dog Creek. I\r\nhad the wagon sheet stretched over the bows, the sides lifted to admit\r\nthe breeze, and sleepy with the heat, I let the horses go on about as\r\nthey pleased; not noticing, until the level rays of the sun warned me\r\nthat it was time to camp, that I had gone farther east than I had\r\nintended. I had my camp outfit with me, however, and as I saw a bunch of\r\ntrees in a ravine a mile from the creek I knew that there must be water\r\nthere. So the three requisites, grass, wood, and water, were at hand.\r\n\r\nAfter pitching the tent, and starting supper, I found to my delight a\r\nlarge exposure of hard siliceous rock, consisting of sand and chalk held\r\nfirmly together by soluble sand, which proved to be the bottom ledge of\r\na deposit of gray sandstone. I soon found above it a mastodon’s bones.\r\nMy joy knew no bounds, however, when following the narrow draw up to its\r\nhead, I found that it cut through a quarry of rhinoceros bones, which\r\nwere sticking out of the sand on either side, while the narrow ditch at\r\nthe bottom was filled with toe bones, complete or in fragments, and\r\nbroken skulls and teeth without number. I have collected fossil\r\nvertebrates and plants since I was seventeen years old, but this is the\r\ngreatest deposit of fossils that I have ever discovered.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget how, carried away with enthusiasm, I took\r\npossession in the name of Science of the largest bone bed in Kansas. I\r\ndid not stop to ask whether anyone else had any interest in the land,\r\nnor did I think it necessary. I had grown so used in my own case to\r\nputting aside every other consideration for the sake of the advancement\r\nof science that it did not occur to me that anyone else might take a\r\ndifferent view. But one day, as I was working in the ravine, an old man,\r\nplowing corn, drove up to its eastern edge. When he made the turn, he\r\nchanced to look across and saw me, pick in hand, diligently uncovering\r\nthe skull of a rhinoceros from the sandbank on the other side. He\r\ninstantly shouted with all the strength of his lungs, “What are you\r\ndoing?”\r\n\r\n“Digging up antediluvian relics,” I shouted back. We both shouted as if\r\nwe were a hundred yards apart.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he called, “get out of there!”\r\n\r\n“All right,” I answered in the same loud tones, and kept on working.\r\n\r\nThe old man, whose name I learned later was Mr. Overton, disappeared,\r\nand I heard no more of him until I went into Long Island for food, or\r\ngrub as they say in the West, and was told that he had come in to a\r\njustice of the peace and asked for a warrant to arrest me for collecting\r\nthese old bones. He never again came directly to me, either that year or\r\nthe following, but people told me that he went around to all the\r\njustices in that part of the country, trying to get his warrant.\r\nFinally, however, they managed to convince him that I was not harming\r\nhim, and was benefiting science.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1884, I was employed by the late Professor Marsh to\r\nexplore this same fossil bed. The bones which I was after now were\r\ncovered by fourteen feet of moulding sand and a four-foot ledge of hard\r\nrock, the heavier bones lying on the sandstone, the lighter ones mingled\r\nwith the sand above. This sand and rock had to be removed by pick and\r\nscraper, which meant that there was a large amount of heavy labor before\r\nus. Therefore, having more means at my command than I had had before, I\r\ndrove up to Mr. Overton’s door and offered him forty dollars a month to\r\nwork for us with his team during the whole summer, with the\r\nunderstanding that I was to have all the fossils found. This offer he\r\ngladly accepted, and I found him a very careful worker. Not only did he\r\ndo the rough work well, but when we got a floor laid bare above the\r\nbones, he proved to be a most careful collector. My other assistant on\r\nthis expedition was a Mr. Will Russ, who afterwards became a skilful\r\ndentist.\r\n\r\nOur method of work was first to cut down and remove the sand and rock\r\nfor a space twenty feet wide and perhaps a hundred long, using a plow\r\nand scraper. Then we cleaned up our floor and uncovered the bones with\r\noyster knives and other tools which we had made to suit our purpose.\r\nOne, I remember, was a hoe straightened out at the shank and cut off at\r\nthe corners to make a diamond-shaped tool. With this we could work under\r\nthe high bank, and take out specimens which we could not reach\r\notherwise. Trowels and diggers of various patterns were used also.\r\n\r\nThe bones which we were collecting lay scattered along both sides of the\r\nravine for a quarter of a mile, often in pockets or pot-holes in the\r\ngray sandstone. Of this there are two layers, about fourteen feet apart,\r\nthe interspace being filled with beds of fine moulding sand, with some\r\nwhiting from the underlying chalk, which constituted the land surface\r\nwhen these fresh-water beds were deposited. There are also beds of sand\r\nthat have been washed clean by the currents of the flood-plain of some\r\nancient river, for the exposed section shows all the different deposits\r\nof an overflowed valley. Above the washed sand is a stratum of sand and\r\nclay, indicating that here was a quiet place where the muddy backwater\r\ndeposited its load. This layer, upon exposure, cracks in all directions,\r\nlike the mud at the bottom of a puddle after the water has evaporated.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a problem to account for the number of the animals\r\nrepresented here, and for the fact that the bones are so scattered. All\r\nparts of the skeletons are mingled in the greatest confusion, with no\r\ntwo bones in a natural position. One is, of course, forced, after an\r\nobservation of this country, to agree with Drs. Matthew and Hatcher that\r\nthese bones were deposited in the flood-plain of a running stream and\r\nnot in great lakes, as was believed by older geologists. But the only\r\nsupposition upon which I can account for the intermingling of all the\r\nbones of the skeletons on the bottom sandstone layer is that the fine\r\nsand through which the bones were distributed, becoming saturated with\r\nwater, was converted into a quicksand, in which the bones sank until\r\nthey reached the impenetrable layer below; the heavier bones of course\r\nbeing at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhat caused the death of the countless individuals in the Sternberg\r\nQuarry, is a question not easily answered. The authorities quoted above\r\nbelieve that during the Upper Miocene Period, there were many\r\nwater-courses separated, by slightly elevated divides and broad\r\nflood-plains, with possibly here and there small lakes, where the dense\r\nvegetation had clogged some sluggish stream. But during a rainy season\r\nof unusual duration, the whole region for many miles must have been\r\nconverted into a series of lakes; and all the animals in the vicinity,\r\nafter having gathered at the highest points they could find to escape\r\ndeath, must have been finally overwhelmed by some great flood that\r\ncovered every inch of ground. Then after maceration took place, the\r\nbones might have been scattered by other floods.\r\n\r\nA theory of my own, equally plausible, is that the animals were buried\r\nbeneath a sandstorm, which tore loose the fine sand of the flood-plain,\r\nand scattered it in suffocating volumes over the frightened multitudes\r\nwhich had herded together in search of safety or courage.\r\n\r\nThis land, now three thousand feet above sea level, was only a few feet\r\nabove when these rhinoceroses moved over it in countless herds.\r\nEverywhere were swamps filled with sponge moss, and tropical streams,\r\nwhose wealth of vegetation formed thick jungles along their banks. On\r\nfirmer ground, great areas were covered with a dense growth of rushes,\r\nthrough which the paths of these animals were the only trails; while\r\nhigher up still, the soft damp soil gave a foothold to forests, through\r\nwhich the great mastodons sounded their trumpet calls, as they roamed\r\nabout, tearing up trees with their powerful trunks and feasting upon the\r\nrich, juicy roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—THREE-TOED HORSE, _Hypohippus_.\r\n\r\n  From the Middle Eocene of Colorado.

(After Osborn.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat year, 1884, in which I explored the quarry at Long Island, was a\r\nmemorable one, not only because we secured a large carload of rhinoceros\r\nbones, but also because we had with us Mr. J. B. Hatcher, who afterwards\r\nhelped to build up three great museums of vertebrate paleontology,—the\r\nmuseums of Yale and Princeton and the Carnegie Museum. With the last he\r\nwas connected at the time of his death in 1904, just twenty years after\r\nhe made his first collection of vertebrate fossils with me. A bright,\r\nearnest student, he gave promise of a future even then by his perfect\r\nunderstanding of the work in hand and the thoughtful care which he\r\ndevoted to it. I have always been glad that I had the honor of being his\r\nfirst teacher in the practical work of collecting, although he soon\r\ngraduated from my department, and requested me to let him take one side\r\nof the ravine while I worked the other. He employed Mr. Overton’s son\r\nwith a plow and scraper, and got out a magnificent collection with no\r\nfurther instructions from me.\r\n\r\nThat same year Professor Marsh came to my quarry and leased it from the\r\nowner, and I never saw it again until 1905, when I came into my own once\r\nmore, and in addition to the splendid mastodon, mentioned earlier in\r\nthis chapter, found the material for two perfect mounts of the\r\nrhinoceros. One is to be mounted at Munich, the other at Bonn.\r\n\r\nWith Professor Osborn’s consent, I give a photograph of the fine\r\nspecimen (Fig. 25) which Dr. Wortman secured in 1894 from this quarry\r\nfor the American Museum. A vast collection from the same spot is stored\r\nin the National Museum in its original packages, with which I filled a\r\ncar in 1884. I saw there a whole case filled with the skulls of the\r\nrhinoceros _Teleoceras fossiger_, which I secured in great numbers at\r\nLong Island.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to think that the foundation on which these beds of\r\nfresh-water deposits lie unconformably is the great Cretaceous sea\r\nbottom, whose tilted and uplifted strata tower two thousand feet above\r\nthe carboniferous rocks in eastern Kansas. The Republican, Smoky Hill,\r\nand Kansas rivers have carved their way through all these strata, so\r\nthat by following down these streams, one can get cross sections of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have often asked men who were sure that there must be coal beneath the\r\nsurface, why, instead of hiring a man to dig a hole for them, they did\r\nnot hitch up their buggies and follow the valley of the Smoky Hill,\r\nbeginning at the Colorado line. The first stratum exposed is of course\r\nthe recent, with its sandy loam; in it, here and there, a crumbling\r\nbuffalo skull or an eroded implement. Then comes the Pleistocene\r\ndeposit, consisting of clay, sand, and fragments of rock mingled\r\ntogether. From this formation I secured over two hundred teeth of the\r\ngreat Columbian Mammoth. Next come beds of black shale with giant\r\nseptaria, the Fort Pierre Group of the Cretaceous, whose upper beds we\r\nexplored in Montana in 1876 for dinosaurs. In this formation, in Kansas,\r\nI found a new species of _Clidastes_. The specimens are now in the\r\nKansas University collection, and the species has been named by Dr.\r\nWilliston _Clidastes westi_, in honor of the Kansas University\r\ncollector, the late Judge E. P. West.\r\n\r\nWe have not gone far down the river below the forks, before this\r\nformation, which at McAllister topped the hills, passes under the river.\r\nThen reddish and blue chalks occupy the country for some miles, and in\r\nturn disappear to give place to yellowish and blue chalks, which finally\r\nmake way for the blue and almost white chalks that run under the river\r\nnear the mouth of Hackberry Creek in eastern Gove County.\r\n\r\nAt White Rock in Trego County the hard white limestone, in fortification\r\nblocks, is piled ninety feet high. Further down appears the post\r\nlimestone of the Fort Benton Group, with its characteristic _Inoceramus_\r\nshells; while in central Kansas, brown and white sandstone and\r\nbrilliantly colored clays occupy the whole region for sixty miles,\r\ngiving place at last to the hard limestones and the friable shales and\r\nsandstones of the Upper Carboniferous. No coal, except very shallow\r\nveins in the Upper Carboniferous and the Dakota Group of the Cretaceous,\r\nhas even been found in this big ditch, which, less than a quarter of a\r\nmile wide at the head of the Smoky Hill branch at Wallace, broadens out\r\nto a width of several miles at the mouth of the Kansas River.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to compute the vast amount of mineral matter which has\r\nbeen cut out from these Kansas plains and carried by the river into the\r\nMississippi and on to the Gulf. Since the first narrow trench cut its\r\nway through the hardened ooze of the Cretaceous ocean bed, all the\r\nflood-plains of the Missouri and the Mississippi below Kansas City have\r\nbeen enriched by the material that once covered these valleys of Kansas,\r\nand the delta below New Orleans has been partly built up by it.\r\n\r\nIt may interest my readers and give them a glimpse into the daily\r\nroutine of a fossil hunter’s life, if I quote one or two notes from a\r\ndiary which I kept during my work in these Loup Fork beds.\r\n\r\n“Friday, July 11.—This is to record the most successful day since we\r\nhave been in the field. We have collected three sets of under-jaws,\r\nthree skulls. It has been extremely hot. We have put in eight hours of\r\nhard work.”\r\n\r\n“Saturday, July 12.—To-day I got out and packed our three skulls and\r\nthree lower jaws. They were within the space of a square yard. We got\r\nsome very fine bones, and best of all, a perfect front foot in position,\r\na perfect humerus, a perfect femur, except proximal articulation, the\r\npremaxilla of a cat with a huge canine (saber-toothed tiger). We got\r\ngreat quantities of the bones of the feet, an axis, and one other\r\nvertebræ in good state of preservation, a fine scapula, etc. This\r\nafternoon has been the hottest day of the season, but this evening the\r\nwind changed to the north, and it is quite cool. I got in addition to\r\nthe specimens mentioned a maxilla of a saber-toothed tiger. The enormous\r\nyoung canine was two inches long and three-quarters of an inch wide.”\r\n\r\nI might go on and quote indefinitely, but the story would be about the\r\nsame. I recall, however, one or two incidents connected with my work in\r\nthis field, which may be amusing or interesting to my readers.\r\n\r\nOnce in 1882, while collecting for the Museum of Comparative Zoology of\r\nHarvard University, I met an old gentleman and his dear old wife, the\r\nhair of both showing upon it the snows of many winters, sitting on a\r\nboard laid across a dry-goods box to which two wagon wheels had been\r\nattached. A team of ponies harnessed with rope instead of leather, with\r\nlines of the same material, completed the outfit. The old man and his\r\nwife sat up very straight and dignified and demanded of me what I was\r\ndoing in that part of the country.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” I answered, “I’m looking for rhinoceros bones in the loose sand of\r\nthe hills here.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” the old man said, “I am interested in these old bones myself. I\r\ndon’t claim to be a scholar; in fact, I am quite illiterate, but I think\r\nwhen this earth was in a molten state, these old hippopotamuses wallowed\r\naround in the mud and got congealed in the rocks.”\r\n\r\nThe following incident I did not find quite so amusing. One day I\r\ndiscovered turtle shells sticking out on either side of a narrow gulch\r\nwhich cut through a large deposit of sand. In digging out those already\r\nin sight, I found many more; collecting in all some twenty fine\r\nspecimens, but all quite small. Following down the gorge, I discovered\r\nthat it opened out, on Beaver Creek in Rawlins County, into a great\r\namphitheater several acres in extent and almost denuded of vegetation;\r\nan ideal place for fossil hunting, as the elements had been digging out\r\nand removing the sand for ages. And sure enough, I soon stumbled upon\r\nthe complete shell and skeleton, four feet in diameter, of a specimen of\r\nCope’s _Testudo orthopygia_; but it nearly broke my heart to find that\r\nwhile the specimen had weathered out in a perfect condition, some\r\nvandal—for I shall ever maintain that the wanton destruction of life\r\nthat now is or of the remains of life that once was, is wicked,—some man\r\nhad chopped it all to pieces with a mattock.\r\n\r\nPassing on in a not very pleasant frame of mind, I came upon another\r\nindividual of huge proportions, which had suffered the same fate, and\r\nthen upon another; all that this rich-looking ground afforded had been\r\nutterly ruined.\r\n\r\nAngry at the thought that any man should commit such sacrilege,—for to\r\nme these footsteps of the Creator in the sands of time are sacred,—and\r\nbitterly disappointed, since I knew that I should very likely never\r\nagain come upon such huge specimens of the reptilian life of that age, I\r\nwalked into camp blinded by hot tears, and failed to notice a stranger\r\nwho was sitting there on a box.\r\n\r\n“Some infernal vandal has been up this ravine,” I shouted to Will, “and\r\ndug up with a mattock three of the finest turtles I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nAs if he had been shot, the man jumped from the box and exclaimed in\r\naccents of heartfelt contrition, “It was me. I was out here digging\r\nroots to build a fire with, and ran across them. I didn’t know they had\r\nany value, and I wanted to see what was inside of them and dug into\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nHis surprise and dismay were so comical that the murder vanished from my\r\nheart, and overwrought as I was, I broke out into a fit of\r\nuncontrollable laughter which used me up for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nAnother time I had a rather unusual experience. My assistant, a Mr.\r\nWright, and I were digging out rhinoceros bones on Sappa Creek. We had\r\nnoticed a house on the other side of the creek, although dense timber\r\ncut off most of its surroundings, and happening to look toward it once,\r\nwe saw a girl of about sixteen years rush out from the timber and begin\r\nto climb the steep hill toward us. I never saw anyone run so fast up so\r\nsteep a hill. Her strength failed her, however, when she got to us, and\r\nit was some time before she could tell her story. It seems that her\r\nmother had gone out to milk, and as the ground was slippery from a rain\r\nof the night before, she had fallen and dislocated one of the bones in\r\nthe palm of her hand.\r\n\r\nAll the men were away and had taken all the horses, and it was seventeen\r\nmiles to the nearest doctor. The girl, knowing that we were digging up\r\nbones, had concluded that we could set them, and had come to us for\r\nhelp. Although I had never attempted anything of the kind before, I\r\ncould not resist the poor child’s appeal and went to the house. The\r\nmother lay moaning on her bed, and would answer nothing when I asked\r\nwhether I should try to set her hand. But as the girl was very desirous\r\nthat I should make the attempt, I decided to do so. So while Mr. Wright\r\nheld the arm, I put splints and a roller bandage under the hand, which\r\nwas laid on a table, and then forcibly pushed the bone back into its\r\nnatural position. After which I bandaged the hand tightly. I left\r\ndirections with the girl to hang a can of water with a small hole in it\r\nover the hand, so that the water might drip on it and by evaporation\r\ncool it and prevent inflammation. My instructions were carried out by\r\nthe brave girl, and her mother’s hand was soon as well as ever.\r\n\r\nIn these last chapters I have often wandered far afield, for it would\r\nhave taken too long to relate all the events of my various expeditions\r\nin consecutive order. Hoping that my readers will pardon the\r\ndigressions, I return to the expedition of 1877.\r\n\r\nRussell Hill proved a most efficient assistant, and it has always\r\ngrieved me that he should in later years have given up work in the\r\nfossil fields for the practice of medicine. Will Brouse, too, was an\r\nenthusiastic worker; he was not satisfied to be relegated to the pots\r\nand kettles and horses, and not only did his duty as our teamster and\r\ncook, but soon accomplished almost, if not quite as much in the field as\r\nany one of us. I never had a more congenial party in all the years of my\r\nfield work.\r\n\r\nBut one day in August I received a bulky letter from Professor Cope.\r\n“Turn over all the outfit to Mr. Hill,” he wrote, “and go at once to a\r\nnew field discovered in the desert of eastern Oregon. Go to Fort\r\nKlamath, Oregon, and from there to Silver Lake, to a man by the name of\r\nDuncan, the postmaster. He will guide you to the fossil bed in the heart\r\nof the sage-brush desert. You will likely find human implements mingled\r\nwith extinct animals. You are to go secretly; tell no one where you are\r\ngoing. Have your mail sent by a circuitous route, so you cannot be\r\ntraced.”\r\n\r\nI received the Professor’s order with excitement and great joy; but in\r\nspite of his injunction to start at once and without communicating my\r\nintention to anyone, I could not bring myself to leave for the Pacific\r\nCoast, to be gone for an indefinite time, without bidding good-by to my\r\nfather and mother, and I concluded that even if someone should find out\r\nwhere I was going and try to follow me I could easily give him the slip\r\nand get to the field first.\r\n\r\nBuffalo, the nearest railway station, was seventy-five miles away, a two\r\ndays’ journey, with our big load of fossils. So I mounted my riding pony\r\nand made the long trip the next day, reaching the station at sunset,\r\ntired and sore. My pony, however, endowed with the enduring power\r\ncharacteristic of a good Indian pony, was still fresh enough to shy at a\r\nrattlesnake in the road, and as I happened to be sitting sideways in the\r\nsaddle, throw me to the ground within a few feet of the snake.\r\n\r\nThat night I went to my home in Ellsworth County, bade my dear ones\r\ngood-by for an indefinite length of time, and was back at Buffalo again\r\nat midnight of the following day. My boys met me at the station with my\r\nroll of blankets, tools, and baggage, and away I went to “fresh fields\r\nand pastures new.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                EXPEDITION TO THE OREGON DESERT IN 1877\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Monument Station, I was surprised to see Mr. S. W. Williston get\r\naboard with all his outfit. Williston did not know at first that I was\r\non the train, and when he entered my car, he was greatly astonished,\r\nthinking that I was on his trail. He tried to find out my destination,\r\nbut failed. We slept together at Denver. Then he took a train south,\r\nwhile I went north toward Cheyenne and the West.\r\n\r\nOnward our train sped toward the land of the setting sun, through the\r\ngrand and impressive scenery of the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas. At\r\nSacramento I took the railroad for Redding, where, with seven other\r\npassengers, I entered a Concord coach drawn by a team of eight horses,\r\nand continued my journey by stage.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely August evening. The moon was at its full, and the night\r\nwas almost as bright as day. No sound broke the deep silence, except now\r\nand then the whoo of an owl as it called to its mate far away in the\r\ndepth of the forest, or the plash of running water falling in cascades\r\nover the shelving rocks and dashing against the boulders.\r\n\r\nHigher and higher we climbed, through primeval forests of spruce and\r\nfir, whose branches clove the sky a hundred feet above our heads. The\r\nrarefied air filled our lungs with its life-giving tonic, exhilarating\r\nus like wine. We knew that far above us rose Mount Shasta, the giant of\r\nthe range, but for a time the heavy timber shut out the view, and we\r\ncould see only the road ahead, winding up and up through the forests.\r\nThen suddenly, without warning, we moved above the timber-line, and\r\nMount Shasta stood revealed in all its beauty, a perfect cone, towering\r\nfour thousand feet into the air, its robes of everlasting snow\r\nglistening in the moonlight. Above, in the clear blue of the sky, the\r\nstars sparkled like jewels in an immortal canopy.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that any of us had looked upon that majestic\r\nscene, and whatever may have been the differences of temperament among\r\nus, we were one in the feeling of awe which the glorious picture\r\ninspired. It laid a spell upon us; we were dumb before the invisible\r\npresence of the Power that had reared this stupendous pinnacle, and\r\ninvoluntarily our thoughts turned to that “city that hath foundations,\r\nwhose builder and maker is God.”\r\n\r\nThen to break the awful silence, and give some vent to our emotions, we\r\nbroke out into the old song, “’Way down upon the Suwanee River”; and so\r\nwe journeyed on for many hours, never out of sight of that majestic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAt Ashland I was obliged to wait for a driver with a buckboard and a\r\nteam of ponies to take me to Fort Klamath, Oregon. I was at that time a\r\ngreat lover of the gentle art of fishing, and early in the morning,\r\nbefore it was fully light, I was astir among the great live-oaks that\r\ngrace the town. Walking through the sleeping village, I ran across the\r\nfootprints of a large grizzly bear in the dust of the road, and followed\r\nthem through the vacant streets. Wherever a gate had been left open, the\r\nbear had entered the yard, walked around the house, and come out at the\r\ngate again. I hoped to get a glimpse of him, but was disappointed, as\r\nthe tracks led into the gloom of the forest. So I went fishing, and\r\ncaught some speckled beauties for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThat evening I was driven over to Fort Klamath, where I was kindly\r\ninvited to take possession of the commanding officer’s quarters and make\r\nmyself at home; an invitation which I proceeded to accept at once.\r\n\r\nLearning that a sheep-owner a few miles away had killed a grizzly, I\r\nwent out to his camp to see it. Sure enough, there lay the mighty\r\ncarcass, encircled with four inches of grease, enough for the polls of\r\nall the boys in Oregon. It seemed that as the time for his winter nap\r\nwas approaching, Mr. Bruin had been laying in a supply of fuel by\r\ndevouring the fat wethers of our friend’s flock. The latter had built a\r\nheavy brush fence around the sheep, and with the help of a large number\r\nof hounds, had kept his range free from coyotes, but he had been\r\nhelpless before the attacks of this big bear. When he watched on top of\r\nthe brush fence, he was not molested, but no sooner did he seek the\r\ncomfortable cot in his tent, than his slumbers were broken by the\r\npiteous bleat of some sheep, as it was carried off to the woods by the\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days before I reached Klamath, he had been awakened in the\r\nmiddle of the night by a commotion in the flock, and rushing out in his\r\nshirt into the cool night air, had seen the bear only ten feet away,\r\nacross a deep and narrow stream. Without thinking of the consequences to\r\nhimself if he only wounded the creature, he opened fire with his\r\nWinchester, and the first shot broke the bear’s neck.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, the skin had been removed, but the huge carcass, which\r\nmust have weighed at least a ton, had been lying in the hot August sun\r\never since. The sheep-owner (I am sorry that I have forgotten his name,\r\nas I was under heavy obligations to him) promised me that after\r\nbreakfast he would help me in the not very enviable task of removing the\r\ndecaying flesh from the bones. But after one whiff from the windward\r\nside, he asked a pertinent question, was I fond of trout, and upon my\r\nanswering yes, remarked that he knew of a creek where he could get some\r\nbeauties, and immediately disappeared. I saw him no more that morning.\r\n\r\nAt the first thrust of my knife into the bear, the stench was so\r\nhorrible that I grew deathly sick. I filled my pipe and tried to find\r\nrelief in smoking, but even then the odor was overpowering, and I smoked\r\nand sickened through the livelong day, until I had cleaned the filthy\r\nflesh from the bones, and they had been tied up in gunny-sacks and hung\r\nin a tree to dry. Then into the creek I went and with soap and sand\r\nscrubbed and scoured my body; but the horrid smell still hung about me,\r\nand I could eat neither supper nor breakfast the next morning, although\r\nat dinner I managed to stow away a good square meal. But even now, after\r\nthirty years, if you say “bear” to me, I can smell that bear.\r\n\r\nAt Klamath I hired for my assistant a man named George Loosely. I also\r\nbought two saddle ponies and one to carry the pack; and with a\r\ngovernment tent and other outfit and rations purchased at the\r\ncommissary,—we had our flour baked into bread by the post baker,—we\r\nstarted for Silver Lake, although no one at the post could give us any\r\ndirections. I had a department map, sent to me by Professor Cope, which\r\nrecorded, mistakenly as we found later, that Sprague River rose in\r\nSilver Lake. The government road to the east crossed the Williamson\r\nRiver on a government bridge, and came to an abrupt end in an Indian\r\nvillage on the western bank of Sprague River. So we decided to take the\r\nroad as far as we could and then follow up the river to its source in\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the Williamson River, we found there the lodge of a\r\nSnake Indian, who appeared dressed in red paint and a breech-cloth, and\r\ndemanded toll. But as American citizens we had paid taxes to help pay\r\nfor that bridge; so we refused to pay toll for the use of our own\r\nproperty, and rode across in spite of the threats hurled at us.\r\n\r\nWe reached Sprague River that same evening, and went into camp a short\r\ndistance from a large Indian town. The houses, built by government\r\ncontractors of rough logs, consisted of a single room with a shake roof.\r\nThe Indians had torn out the board floors, and instead of using the\r\nfireplaces and chimneys which the builders had erected for their\r\nconvenience, they had cut holes in the roofs, and built their fires in\r\nthe middle of the floor, sleeping around them at night as their fathers\r\nused to do in their lodges or Sibley tents.\r\n\r\nGeorge, who was more familiar with them than I was, learned that a chief\r\nlay dying in one of the houses, and after supper he left me and went to\r\nwitness the death ceremonies. After stowing away the bread and coffee\r\nbetween our mattresses and covering them with blankets, and hiding the\r\nbacon at the bottom of the mess box with tin dishes piled on top of it\r\nso that I should hear the rattle if a thieving Indian attempted to get\r\nat it, I, being tired, dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock in the morning, George appeared, having been shut up\r\nin the house with the dying chief all night. When the medicine man began\r\nhis incantations, the doors and windows were closed, while the steaming\r\nIndians danced in a circle around the dying chief, forcing the unwilling\r\nGeorge to take part in the ceremonies. All night long they moved around\r\nin their death dance to the music of their drums and the wild\r\ngesticulations of the medicine man, and when George finally got away, he\r\nwas about exhausted. He was soon lost in sleep, and as I habitually lie\r\non my sound ear, neither of us heard anything through the night. But the\r\nnext morning, when George had put on the coffee to boil and went into\r\nthe mess box for the bacon, it had disappeared. The dishes had been\r\ncarefully replaced.\r\n\r\nAfter a breakfast of bread and coffee, we were early in the saddle,\r\ntaking a heavy trail that led north and skirted Sprague River. By the\r\nmerest chance, we met a white man, the first we had seen since leaving\r\nthe post, and we stopped to ask the way to Silver Lake. A number of\r\nSnake Indians were standing around at the time. The man told us to go\r\nnorth on the trail to a sheep camp in Sican Valley, where we would\r\nreceive further directions, and thanking him, we rode confidently\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nJust as the sun was sinking, we entered a splendid forest of fir and\r\nspruce, and soon found that our trail forked. The heavy, well-traveled\r\nbranch turned a little west of north; the other, leading due north, had\r\napparently not been used since last year, as it was covered with old\r\nleaves. We did not know what to do, as the man whom we had met in the\r\nmorning had not mentioned this fork. While we were talking about it, we\r\nheard the jingling bells of a pack horse or Indian cayuse, and soon a\r\nboy hove in sight, driving a couple of pack ponies. Moving to one side\r\nto let him pass, I asked him where he was going.\r\n\r\n“To Sican Valley, to a sheep ranch,” he answered, and immediately was\r\nlost to sight among the giant trees. We meekly fell in behind and\r\nhurried after him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we came out into a natural park, the end of our trail. Five\r\nIndian lodges stood about in the open space, and five valiant braves, in\r\ntheir usual attire of paint and breech-cloths, with the inevitable\r\nWinchester, stepped forward to inform us that “white man was lost in the\r\nwoods,” and that they would show him the trail for two dollars.\r\n\r\n“Where is that miserable papoose?” I demanded, but they only grinned and\r\nrepeated, “We will show you the road for two dollars.”\r\n\r\nIt was my habit, in a crisis of this kind, to smoke, for I regret to say\r\nthat I was for many years a lover of the soothing weed; so, drawing out\r\nof my saddlebag a pound of fragrant “Lone Jack,” I proceeded to fill my\r\npipe and decide upon my further course. Instantly the Indians crowded\r\naround me, and dropping the butts of their guns to the ground, pulled\r\nout their tobacco pouches, and opening them wide, held them up to be\r\nfilled, crying in chorus, “Me tobac! Me tobac!”\r\n\r\nBut the memory of the deceitful boy was still rankling in my mind. I\r\ntold George to follow me with the pack horse, and deliberately lighting\r\nmy pipe and filling my lungs with smoke to their utmost capacity, I blew\r\na cloud of it into the faces of the expectant beggars. Then I drove my\r\nspurs into my pony’s flanks and started off in a mad race against time,\r\nas the long shadows warned me only too plainly that the daylight, our\r\nonly guide now, would soon leave us. I did not look back, but George,\r\nwho did, saw the Indians, in anger, level their rifles as they shouted\r\nto us to stop.\r\n\r\nThat race with darkness was an exciting one, but just before night\r\novertook us, we reached the trail which we had left to follow the lying\r\nIndian boy. In our haste, our bread had been torn from its sack by the\r\noutstretched limb of a tree, and was lost. However, we were so thankful\r\nto have escaped paying toll to those filthy Snakes, that we cheerfully\r\nmade our supper of coffee, and sought our blankets.\r\n\r\nAt the first streak of daylight, after another meal of coffee, we were\r\nin our saddles; and we traveled all day, until, just as the sun was\r\nsetting, we heard the welcome bleat of sheep and saw the herders driving\r\ntheir flocks down the slopes of the neighboring hills to their corrals\r\nin Sican Valley. Following them, we soon spied the camp in the heavy\r\ntimber and smelled the delicious savor of a pot of mutton that was\r\nboiling over the fire. And before long, seated at the rude table, we\r\nwere enjoying to the uttermost the hospitality of the camp.\r\n\r\nWe had learned on the journey that Sprague River rises in the heart of\r\nthe mountains, instead of in Silver Lake, and we had crossed the divide\r\nbetween it and the lake before reaching Sican Valley. The next morning\r\nour sheepmen directed us on our way; and that same evening we were\r\nskirting the lake’s lovely shores. Its wide expanse of water put me in\r\nmind of my boyhood days on Otsego Lake or the Glimmer-glass.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached the hospitable home of Mr. Duncan, the postmaster of\r\nSilver Lake. He had built a comfortable house of logs, with a large\r\nchimney at one end and an old-fashioned fireplace, around which, as the\r\nnights were cold, we gathered and talked until far into the night.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan’s family consisted of his wife and daughter, a dear, good\r\ngirl, who will forgive me, I am sure, if I tell a story at her expense.\r\nGeorge and I were sent to bed in a lean-to, and as our bedroom was next\r\nto that of the Duncans and the stoppings had fallen out of some of the\r\nchinks in the wall between, we could hear everything that was said in\r\ntheir room. In the middle of the night I woke up and heard the old\r\ngentleman talking to his wife about their daughter.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” he said, “I think John will be a good husband for Mary, don’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nBefore she could answer, Mary, who had a bed at the other end of the\r\nparents’ room, called out with great energy, “I think so too, father!”\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was still, while George and I, in our efforts to keep\r\nquiet, stuffed the bedclothes into our mouths until we were almost\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\nWe unloaded our weary pack horse, and the next day brought our supplies,\r\nand loaded them into Mr. Duncan’s wagon. Then taking him with us for\r\nguide, we started on our long drive to the boneyard, fifty-six miles\r\nthrough the great sage-brush desert of eastern Oregon.\r\n\r\nOn we journeyed, through what seemed an interminable expanse of\r\nsage-brush, greasewood, and sand. The bunches of sage-brush topped\r\nconical mounds of sand, whose sides were scoured and polished by the\r\nwinds that howled in and out through the labyrinth of hills, laden with\r\ndrifting sand. If one could have gained an elevation above the level of\r\nthese sandhills, and looked out over the landscape, one would have gazed\r\nupon a scene of even greater desolation than that afforded by the\r\nparched short-grass plains of western Kansas,—a dreary, monotonous waste\r\nof olive green, stretching away north, east, and south, as far as the\r\neye could reach, and shut in on the west by the great ranges of the\r\nSierras, whose flanks, dark below the timber line with heavy forests,\r\nwere deeply scarred above with glistening white glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe followed the California road to Oregon, for in those days Oregon was\r\npractically an unknown territory, with the exception of the Willamette\r\nValley. And I suppose that it is still so, for that moist, fertile\r\nvalley differs as widely from the vast semi-desert east of the Cascade\r\nRange as the Santa Clara Valley from the cactus-covered sandhills of\r\nsouthern California.\r\n\r\nAt night, after a day’s journey through sand and sage-brush, we came to\r\na ranch beside an alkaline lake in the very heart of the desert. Here,\r\nin a cabin built of logs from the neighboring mountains, lived the\r\nhermit of this region, a man named Lee Button. Had it not been that the\r\nroad passed his door, he would have seen only a hunter now and then, out\r\nafter the deer which abounded in the desert, or perhaps the cattlemen\r\nwhen in winter they turned their cattle loose in the desert to look out\r\nfor themselves. On all the neighboring ranches, the cattle were turned\r\ninto the desert for food and shelter in winter. Here, protected from\r\nstorms, they fed upon the alkaline grass and sweet sage and upon the\r\nthick leaves which fell in handfuls from the greasewood bushes. These\r\ncattle had cut innumerable paths at every conceivable angle, and one\r\nunaccustomed to the country might easily become confused and lose\r\nhimself in the labyrinth of trails. There was horror in the thought of\r\nbeing lost in that solitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncan put up his horses in the barn of the ranch, which was well\r\nstocked with hay and oats, and we picketed our ponies on a flat covered\r\nwith alkaline grass on the borders of the lake. Then from under a\r\ncertain post which he knew of, Mr. Duncan dug up a tin can containing\r\nthe key of the cabin. Past experience had taught Mr. Button caution. He\r\nhad gone to California once, after a herd of horses, leaving his door\r\nunlocked, and some prowling immigrant had abused his hospitality and\r\nrobbed his cabin of its store of food and blankets. So now, when he left\r\nhome, he locked the door and hid the key, giving, however, the secret of\r\nits hiding-place to his neighbor, Mr. Duncan.\r\n\r\nHis cooking utensils, consisting of a camp kettle, a frying pan, a Dutch\r\noven, and a coffee pot, were brought out and cleaned, and the larder\r\nsearched for food. It was the custom of the country at that day to\r\nconsider food and shelter free to all. I was offered the next year a\r\nhouse, blankets, flour, and bacon, as much as I could use for nothing,\r\nif I wanted to spend the winter on a ranch in eastern Oregon. I was only\r\nexpected to cut my own wood and cook my own food.\r\n\r\nSoon a cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth, and the burning\r\nsage-brush was filling the air with that indescribable odor from which\r\none is never free while in the desert. We had traveled through great\r\ndroves of wild geese along the lake, and as they were so tame that they\r\nsimply stepped out of our way like barnyard geese, we did not think it\r\nworth while to waste ammunition on them. So I set three traps, common\r\nsteel traps such as are used for catching coons, and strewed oats around\r\nthem. The next morning I found a brant in one, a magpie in another, and\r\nthe house cat in the third. We let the cat and the magpie go, and\r\nbreakfasted on the brant. Our usual fare was bacon, bread, and coffee,\r\nand sometimes dried apples. I worked for years in Oregon with no other\r\nfood, except an occasional deer or mountain sheep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, trusting entirely to Mr. Duncan’s guidance, we pushed on\r\nwithout a trail, winding in and out among the hillocks with no landmarks\r\nbut the mountains in the west. At sunset, we came out into the open on\r\nthe shore of a small alkaline lake. “Fossil Lake,” I named it at once,\r\nand it goes by that name to this day. This pond, as we should call it in\r\nold New York, covered only a few acres then, and is now entirely dried\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“There,” shouted Mr. Duncan, as he pointed with his whip to the lake\r\nshore, “there is the boneyard.”\r\n\r\nI instantly requested him to help George get supper and pitch the tent,\r\nand seizing my collecting bag, rushed down to the shore. The clay bottom\r\nof the ancient lake had been dried out, and now formed the shore of the\r\nremaining water. This old lake bed had once extended over a much larger\r\narea, but it had been partially buried beneath large piles of drifting\r\nsand. Scattered through the loose sand and on the clay bed were great\r\nnumbers of the bones and teeth of reptiles, birds, and mammals,\r\nindiscriminately mingled. I had come upon a boneyard indeed.\r\n\r\nI was down on the sand at once, picking up bones and teeth and putting\r\nthem in piles. No two bones seemed to belong together, and the skulls\r\nand arches had been crushed beneath the feet of animals, probably cattle\r\nand deer, which had come down to drink at the lake. What pleased me,\r\nhowever, was the fact that scattered among these remains of an earlier\r\nday, were arrow-heads and spear-points of polished obsidian, or volcanic\r\nglass. I was too much excited then to notice that I did not find a\r\nsingle bone or tooth in its original position in the clay matrix, but\r\nthat all were loose, detached, and scattered, and that the implements\r\nwere lying about in the same way.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Duncan was to return to the post-office at Silver Lake the next\r\nmorning, I gathered a cigar-boxful of loose teeth, arrow-heads, and\r\nspear-points, and packed them to send off to Professor Cope. And that\r\nnight, by a sage-brush fire, I wrote the letter which he saw fit to\r\npublish in the _American Naturalist_, a magazine of which he was the\r\neditor, under a title of his own, “Pliocene Man,” and signed “E. D.\r\nCope.”\r\n\r\nFor weeks I sifted through my fingers the fine sand of that lake shore,\r\npicking out bone after bone. The only specimen which I found undisturbed\r\nin the clay matrix was part of the skull of a hairy mammoth, or _Elephas\r\nprimigenius_.\r\n\r\nDr. Shufeldt is the author of a valuable memoir on the fossil birds of\r\nthis region,—“The Fossil Avi-Fauna of the Equus Beds of the Oregon\r\nDesert,” published by the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences. He worked\r\nover the collection made by the late Professor Condon of the Oregon\r\nState University, the collection which Professor Cope made a few years\r\nafter mine, and mine.\r\n\r\nIn these three collections, he finds five species of grebes, and nine of\r\ngulls, of which two species are new to science, Professor Condon being\r\nthe discoverer of one, while I found the other. Of cormorants, there are\r\ntwo species, one discovered by Cope. One species, quite common among the\r\nfossil remains, is now extinct. There is a new swan also, described by\r\nProfessor Cope, who writes of it: “This swan was discovered by\r\nex-Governor Whitaker of Oregon [who discovered the Fossil Lake locality]\r\nin the Pliocene formations of the state. The same bird was afterwards\r\nprocured by my assistant, Charles H. Sternberg.” Altogether there are\r\nnineteen species of Anseres, i. e., geese, ducks, swans, etc., of which\r\ntwo are new.\r\n\r\nOne of my discoveries was a flamingo, which was dedicated to Professor\r\nCope under the title _Phœnicopterus copei_. Dr. Shufeldt says: “It is a\r\nfact of no little interest that a flamingo inhabited the lakes of the\r\nSilver Lake region of Oregon during the Pliocene Epoch.” The collections\r\ninclude a heron and a couple of coots also. Among the fowl are four\r\ngrouse, discovered by Cope, and an entirely new genus and species which\r\nI had the honor of finding. Of eagles, there are two species. There are\r\nalso a great horned owl, a blackbird, and a raven.\r\n\r\nAmong the other fossil remains taken from this region are six genera of\r\nfish, a majority of them new, and fifteen species of fossil mammalia,\r\nincluding two llamas, three horses, an elephant, a dog, an otter, a\r\nbeaver, a mouse, a great sloth, _Mylodon_, as large as a grizzly bear,\r\nand other forms.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Condon,” writes Dr. Shufeldt in his memoir, “was the first\r\nscientific man to visit the Fossil Lake region, with the results already\r\nstated. Cope and his assistant Charles Sternberg came later, and\r\ngathered many hundred bones and bone fragments.” And in the preface to\r\nhis “Tertiary Vertebrata,” Vol. III, page xxvii, Professor Cope writes:\r\n“The Tertiary formations explored in 1878 were the John Day, Loup Fork,\r\nand Equus beds. These were examined by Charles H. Sternberg both in\r\nWashington and Oregon; in the former near to Fort Walla Walla, and in\r\nthe latter, in the desert east of the Sierra Nevada. The basin of an\r\nancient lake, originally discovered by Governor Whitaker of Oregon, was\r\nfound strewn with the bones of llamas, elephants, horses, sloths, and\r\nsmaller animals, with birds, and all were collected by Mr. Sternberg and\r\nsafely forwarded to Philadelphia. I examined this locality myself in\r\n1879 and obtained further remains of extinct and recent species of\r\nmammalia found mingled with numerous worked flints.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will notice that Cope puts my expedition in ’78 instead of\r\n’77 and that Dr. Shufeldt gives Cope’s visit to Fossil Lake as before\r\nmine, when, in reality, it was two years later.\r\n\r\nOn p. 420 of his memoir, Dr. Shufeldt writes: “We must believe that it\r\nstill remains problematical whether man was there, and further\r\ncomparative search is demanded to decide whence came, and at what time,\r\nthose stone implements of human manufacture, commingled as they are with\r\nthe bones of the animals, many of which are long since extinct.” And\r\nProfessor Cope says on the same subject: “Scattered everywhere in the\r\ndeposit were obsidian implements of human manufacture. Some of these\r\nwere of inferior workmanship, and many of them covered with a patin of\r\nno great thickness, which completely replaced the luster of the surface.\r\nOther specimens were bright as when first made. The abundance of these\r\nflints was remarkable, and suggested that they may have been shot at the\r\ngame, both winged and otherwise, that in former times frequented the\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\nAfter I had written the letter already mentioned, having carefully gone\r\nover all the ground in the vicinity of Fossil Lake, and longing for new\r\nworlds to conquer, I started out one day on my pony through the desert,\r\nhoping to find another locality in which the wind had uncovered a fossil\r\nbed. I spent the greater part of the day in fruitless search, and was\r\nabout to return home when I was attracted by the top of a dead spruce\r\ntree sticking out of a sandhill. The rest of the tree had been\r\ncompletely buried by the sand.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was aroused, and I climbed to the top of the hill to\r\nexamine the spruce. When I reached the top, however, I found myself\r\nlooking down into a pleasant little valley, which had been scooped out\r\nby the wind, and, descending, I discovered that I had stumbled upon the\r\nformer site of an Indian village. Places near where the lodges had stood\r\nwere marked by piles of the bleached bones of existing species of\r\nantelope, deer, rabbits, etc. None of these bones were petrified like\r\nthose at Fossil Lake.\r\n\r\nNear the site of each lodge stood a large mortar, made of volcanic rock,\r\nwith a pestle lying in it. They had probably been used by the squaws for\r\ngrinding up acorns and other materials for bread-making. Doubtless a\r\nstorm of sand had forced the villagers to flee for their lives without\r\ngiving them time to save even these valuable mortars.\r\n\r\nI found a spring of cold water which had built up a mound of white sand,\r\nand from the side of a sandhill I pulled out the back part of a human\r\nskull. I could not tell how large the village had been, as it extended\r\ninto the sandhill.\r\n\r\nI soon found where the ancient arrow-maker had had his shop by the great\r\nquantities of cast-off obsidian chips that covered the ground, as well\r\nas by the broken and perfect arrow-heads and spear-points, beautifully\r\npolished and finished, and the knives, drills, and the like that lay\r\nabout. I did not find a vestige of anything made of iron.\r\n\r\nHaving secured a number of the obsidian points, which I afterwards sent\r\nto Cope, I started for camp; but I had delayed too long, and night\r\novertook me before I reached home. My pony and I came near being lost in\r\nthe desert. I gave him the lines, but I was much worried at not seeing\r\nthe welcome glow of the camp fire, when I had thought that I must be\r\nnear my tent. Finally I shouted, and at last heard a faint answer. But\r\neven then, owing to my deaf ear, I could not locate the camp, and had to\r\nwait until George came up and piloted me in.\r\n\r\nNow without doubt the arrow-heads and spear-points mingled with the\r\nbones at Fossil Lake are of the same manufacture as those which I found\r\nat this Indian village, although the latter are not so much weathered,\r\nhaving evidently been recently covered with sand. I conclude, therefore,\r\nthat the implements mingled with the bones are no older than the\r\nvillage, perhaps a hundred years old. They were probably shot by the\r\nIndians of the village at the wild animals which doubtless came in great\r\nnumbers to the lake to drink. Then some powerful wind, like that which\r\ncovered the village, drifted away the sand that lay over the fossil\r\nbones, and the flints, being too heavy to be carried away with the sand,\r\ndropped down and mingled with the bones. This seems to me the only\r\npossible explanation. And I am glad to say that so high an authority as\r\nProfessor J. C. Merriam of the University of California, after the most\r\ncareful study and explorations, agrees with me in this. He has recently\r\nbeen over the Fossil Lake region, and he assures me that it is a mistake\r\nto suppose that the human implements found there were contemporary with\r\nthe extinct animals of the Equus Beds.\r\n\r\nWhenever George and I had collected a load of fossils, we took them in\r\nto Button’s ranch. One day we were late in starting, and realized that\r\nwe should have to hurry to reach the ranch before dark. As so often\r\nhappens, this was the very occasion upon which we were fated to be\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nAt a certain place on our route, we had to pass some mud springs,\r\ncircular wells filled to the brim with thick, yellowish mud of the\r\nconsistency of mortar. In wet weather they continually boiled up without\r\noverflowing, but to-day they were covered with a hard coating of dry\r\nmud, cracked deeply in all directions.\r\n\r\nI called to George, who was driving the pack horse, to watch him and see\r\nthat he did not jump into the spring that we were just passing; but the\r\nwords were hardly out of my mouth when the miserable wretch made a\r\nrunning jump, and landing in the middle of the crust, broke through and\r\nwent down into the thick, nasty mud. As he was going down, he seemed to\r\nrealize what he had done, and managed to get his front feet over the rim\r\nof solid earth. And there he hung, the broad pack—we had brought along\r\nour tent and blankets—helping to buoy him up.\r\n\r\nWe sprang from our horses, and made a rush to save our precious fossils,\r\nbeside which everything else, including the mischievous pony, was of no\r\naccount. We had to cut the ropes that bound the fossils and camp outfit\r\nto the animal, and when we had them safe on solid ground, tie a rope\r\naround his neck and pull him out. Of course he was thoroughly\r\nfrightened, and did everything in his power to help us. Such a looking\r\nhorse you never saw as he was when we got him out. His whole body was\r\ncovered with a coat of sticky, yellow mud, which we could not scrape\r\noff. We had to take him into a creek and give him such a scrubbing as, I\r\nthink, no member of the genus _Equus_ ever had before or since.\r\n\r\nAll this took time, and it was late at night before we reached the\r\nranch. It was our habit, when we got to the cabin and felt that it would\r\nbe too much trouble to open our pack and get out our own supplies, to\r\nhelp ourselves from Mr. Button’s store. So, after we had put the horses\r\nin the barn and given them a liberal feed of oats and plenty of hay, we\r\nwent into the larder to get something for our own supper, for by that\r\ntime we were pretty hungry.\r\n\r\nAfter supper I lay down on the absent lord’s blankets, and was smoking\r\nthe pipe of peace, when a knock was heard at the door. It surprised me,\r\nas it was the custom of the country to walk in without the formality of\r\nknocking. I shouted, “Come in!” and a short, heavy-set man entered. He\r\nsaid that he had been overtaken by night, and as both he and his team\r\nwere in need of food, rest, and shelter, he wanted to know whether we\r\nwould take him in.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly,” I answered. I have noticed that most men are liberal\r\nwith other men’s property. “I don’t own the ranch, but we have just put\r\nour horses in the barn, where there is plenty of hay and oats, and there\r\nis plenty of food here. George will show you the way to the barn and\r\nhelp you unhitch, and I will have supper ready when you return.”\r\n\r\nHe thanked me, and while they were putting up the team, I got a hot\r\nsupper with materials from Mr. Button’s larder. This meal was greatly\r\nrelished by our midnight guest.\r\n\r\nI returned to the bed and my pipe, and was entering into a lively\r\nconversation with the stranger, when the thought suddenly flashed into\r\nmy head, What if this man owns the ranch? I sprang from the bed on the\r\ninstant, and fired pointblank the question, “Do you know Lee Button?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve seen him,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“That’s your name, isn’t it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the stranger, and I felt so cheap that I would have sold out\r\nfor nothing. But this was Mr. Button’s chance to show what sort of a man\r\nhe was, and when I apologized for the freedom with which we had made\r\nourselves at home in his house and used his goods, he told me that we\r\nhad done exactly right, and that he would have felt hurt if we had acted\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nHe became a true friend and helper, and his log cabin proved a valuable\r\nplace of shelter for my party during some of the cold October nights. If\r\nthese lines should ever reach his eyes, they carry to him my cordial\r\nthanks for his hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                EXPEDITION TO THE JOHN DAY RIVER IN 1878\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter 1877–’78 I camped on Pine Creek, Washington, exploring\r\nthe swamps in the neighborhood and fighting against water to secure\r\nspecimens. We had dug a large shaft down to the bed of gravel, twelve\r\nfeet below the surface, in which bones were to be found, but every\r\nmorning we found that the hole had filled with mud and water over night,\r\nand we had to spend hours bailing it out. When we finally got it clear\r\nagain, we had little time or strength left for securing fossils. This\r\nperformance had to be repeated day after day, and of course the farther\r\nwe excavated, the more water there was to be bailed out. I don’t think\r\nthat we were dry a single day that winter. But luckily the water was\r\nwarm, and we did not suffer from colds.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of April I started with a team and wagon from Fort\r\nWalla Walla, accompanied by my two assistants, Joe Huff and “Jake”\r\nWortman, the latter at that time an intelligent young man from Oregon,\r\nwho had been introduced to me the winter before by my brother, Surgeon\r\nGeorge M. Sternberg, at that time post surgeon of Fort Walla Walla.\r\nDuring the past six months Wortman had been my guest at my camp on Pine\r\nCreek. Afterwards he became known to science as Dr. J. L. Wortman.\r\n\r\nWe skirted the Blue Mountains in a southwesterly direction, traveling\r\nthrough the beautiful wheat-fields of that fertile region; and striking\r\nsouth at Cayuse Station on the Umatilla Reserve, we climbed the long\r\nslopes of the mountains and plunged down into the Grande Rounde, once\r\nthe bed of an ancient lake, but now a lovely valley nestling among the\r\nhills. From this point we drove south to Baker City, and leaving behind\r\nus the jagged peaks of the Powder River Mountains, struck the John Day\r\nRiver at Canyon City.\r\n\r\nOn the second of May we camped on the other side of the mountains in a\r\nlarge meadow. The boys went hunting and got a deer. On the third, our\r\nroad led us again through rugged mountains, covered in places with ice,\r\nand we had to cut footholds for our horses, as they were smooth-shod. We\r\npassed through a large mining gulch, where men were at work\r\nplacer-digging for gold. The whole surface of the country had been dug\r\nover, and was disfigured with holes and ditches and heaps of earth.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of May, after passing through Canyon City, we started for\r\nthe John Day Basin. It snowed nearly all day. On the road we met a man\r\nwho told us of a rich fossil leaf locality, on the Van Horn ranch; and\r\nafter a sixteen-mile drive we found the place and secured some very fine\r\nspecimens. The leaf impressions were found in a soft, shaly clay-stone,\r\nand were very abundant, representing well-preserved Tertiary flora. That\r\nnight we feasted on a large salmon trout which I caught in an irrigation\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth (I am following my notebook) we worked all day. I collected\r\ntwo hundred specimens, and Mr. Wortman eighty-five. They were all very\r\nfine, and represented the oak, the maple, and other species. I secured\r\nsome fish vertebræ also. This is another case in which I lost credit for\r\nearly discoveries. I was told by Professor Cope, a few years before his\r\ndeath, that these specimens had never been examined.\r\n\r\nIn this same locality there is a bed of rock so light that it floats. I\r\nthrew a large mass of it at some object in the water, and was amazed to\r\nsee it float off down the stream. It was the first time that I had ever\r\nseen a rock lighter than water.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of May, after a journey of fifteen days from Walla Walla,\r\nwe reached Dayville, a mile below the crossing of the South Fork of the\r\nJohn Day River. One of the first men I met was a certain Bill Day, whom\r\nI soon after hired as assistant. He had for years been making\r\ncollections of the fossil vertebrates here, usually sending them to\r\nProfessor Marsh. I was able to secure a large and fine collection from\r\nhim and another mountain man, a Mr. Warfield, who had also spent much\r\ntime collecting fossils. Both men had been employed by Professor Marsh\r\nduring his expedition in this region, and were very careful workmen.\r\n\r\nWe camped on Cottonwood Creek and prepared to pack into the Basin, or\r\nCove as it has been called. For a hundred and fifty miles of its course,\r\nthe John Day flows east, skirting the Blue Mountains, but here at\r\nCottonwood or Dayville, it has turned north and cut a great canyon, four\r\nthousand feet deep, through the heart of the mountains, the so-called\r\nGrande Coulée, since known as the Picture Gorge. At the foot of this\r\ncanyon, the mountains swing away from the river in a great horseshoe\r\nbend, closing in upon it again several miles below. This amphitheater,\r\nthree miles wide and thirteen long, is a scene of surprising beauty. The\r\nbrilliantly colored clays and volcanic ash-beds of the Miocene of the\r\nJohn Day horizon paint the landscape with green and yellow and orange\r\nand other glowing shades, while in the background, towering upward for\r\ntwo thousand feet, rise rows upon rows of mighty basaltic columns,\r\neight-sided prisms, each row standing a little back of the one just\r\nbelow, and the last crowned with evergreen forests of pine and fir and\r\nspruce. But no pen can picture the glorious panorama.\r\n\r\nEver since Cretaceous times, when a quiet inland sea laid down the\r\nthousand feet of Kansas chalk, here in the John Day region vulcanism has\r\nheld sway; almost until to-day. Indeed I have often seen the summit of\r\nold Mount Hood wreathed with menacing clouds of smoke, as if she were\r\npreparing to pour forth again her floods of molten lava and devastate\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\nWhen volcanic action first began, great masses of ashes must have been\r\nthrown out over the country, settling in the lakes and covering the\r\nremains of animals which had been accumulating there for ages. Then\r\nfloods of lava, one after another, poured out over the forests, until\r\nthey lay buried beneath two thousand feet of volcanic rock. Where did\r\nthis immense mass of molten rock come from, and how? A dike crosses the\r\nBasin, and for fifteen miles the basaltic columns lie along its edges\r\nlike cordwood; so we know that some of the lava at least was squeezed up\r\nout of the earth’s crust through narrow cracks.\r\n\r\nI remember once, as I was standing with Uncle Johnnie Kirk, the hermit\r\nof the Cove, in front of his cabin, he pointed to the basaltic cliffs\r\nthat towered above us, and observed gravely, “All vegetable matter.” He\r\nhad found at the base remains of the forests which the lava had\r\nengulfed, and had concluded that the whole mass represented similar\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nBefore moving the outfit into the fossil beds I took my pony and started\r\noff to spy out the land. Following a horse trail that led up the gentle\r\nslope west of the canyon represented in Dr. Merriam’s picture of the\r\nMascall Beds I reached a tableland, which proved to be the divide\r\nbetween Cottonwood and Birch creeks. Here I found that the trail leading\r\ndown to the mouth of Birch Creek was very steep—one could have greased\r\none’s boots and slid the whole distance of several hundred feet. I was\r\nafraid to ride down and led my pony, but I soon learned that an Oregon\r\npony has long, well-developed legs and can climb up and down better than\r\nI could myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the river at the mouth of the Grande Coulée, I found to\r\nmy dismay that all the rich-looking green and brown fossil beds were on\r\nthe other side, where the amphitheater which I have mentioned is cut out\r\nof the flank of the mountains. As a boy I had learned to swim\r\ndog-fashion, and as the river was not over thirty or forty feet wide,\r\nand I was determined, after coming so far, to find some fossils and a\r\ngood camping ground, I decided to strip, jump out as far as I could, and\r\npaddle the rest of the way across.\r\n\r\nNo sooner thought than done. In I sprang, discovering too late that I\r\nhad reckoned without my host and that the river, which had been penned\r\nin for miles by the walls of the canyon, was here flowing away from its\r\nprison with amazing swiftness and power. My weak little body was as\r\nhelpless as a straw in its grasp: down I went, and striking a boulder at\r\nthe bottom, was flung up five feet into the air, I took in breath and\r\nclosed my mouth as I went down again; tossing me hither and thither like\r\na cork, beating me against rocks and hurling me high into the air, the\r\nriver bore me swiftly on, until at last, thank God! it tired of its toy,\r\nand threw me to one side into deep water, under a willow whose welcoming\r\nbranches I eagerly clasped. There I hung until I had regained my\r\nstrength enough to pull myself out.\r\n\r\nBut the fossil vertebrates of the John Day beds were still across the\r\nriver and the questions which I had crossed the mountain and risked my\r\nlife to answer were still waiting for replies. Unwilling to return home\r\nbeaten I walked up and down the river shore, and was delighted to find\r\nan old boat caught in a pile of driftwood. I dug it out with my bare\r\nhands, only to find that its seams had parted and that its bottom was as\r\nfull of holes as a sieve. Not dismayed, I found a bed of sticky clay\r\nwith which I calked my ship, and venturing again into the flood, managed\r\nto get to the other shore before the boat sank.\r\n\r\nI found a place to camp lower down, at the mouth of a canyon which\r\nopened out into the level country, and on a little creek that ran in\r\nfront of Uncle Johnnie’s cabin. I was very well pleased with my\r\nexplorations in the fossil beds also, for I found the skull of an\r\nOreodon, a hog-like creature which, judging from the abundance of skulls\r\nand skeletons, must have lived in droves during the time when this rock\r\nwas being deposited in the lakes of this region. These animals were\r\nherbivorous in habit. Uncle Johnnie always referred to them as bears. He\r\noften brought a skull into camp with the remark, “Here’s another bar’s\r\nhead. I’ve killed hundreds of ’em in ole Virginia.”\r\n\r\nI returned to camp much elated, and was planning to pack the outfit into\r\nthe Basin the next day, when to my disgust Joe Huff, who owned the\r\nhorses, refused to pack them, as he did not want to run the risk of\r\ninjuring them. It was useless to tell him that he had been hired to do\r\nwhat I wanted, etc.; he was not to be moved. So I paid him off, and saw\r\nhim start for his home near Moscow, Idaho, riding bareback. I felt sorry\r\nfor him, but he had a stubborn fit on, and there was no doing anything\r\nwith him. After I had hired Bill Day, he wanted me to overlook the past\r\nand re-employ him, but it was too late then.\r\n\r\nI suppose Bill Day must have weighed about a hundred and eighty pounds,\r\nbut he was an expert hunter and a keen observer. He owned a herd of\r\nponies and furnished me with all that I wanted, and as he knew every\r\ninch of the fossil beds and all the best camping grounds, his services\r\nwere invaluable. He kept our larder supplied with venison, also. I think\r\nmy success in that region was largely due to his assistance. I was also\r\nindebted to a Mr. Mascall, a man who lived on the second bottom of the\r\nriver. He had an extra log cabin behind the one he lived in, and he let\r\nus use it as a storeroom for our extra supplies of food and for our\r\nfossils, when we began to secure them.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Mascall had a wife and daughter, and when we came in from the\r\nfossil beds, after several weeks of camping out, it seemed almost like\r\ncoming home to be able to put our feet under a table, eat off stone\r\ndishes, and drink our coffee out of a china cup, and to sleep on a\r\nfeather bed instead of a hard mattress and roll of blankets. Then Mr.\r\nMascall was a good gardener, and always had fresh vegetables, a most\r\nenjoyable change from hot bread, bacon, and coffee. I shall not soon\r\nforget his hospitality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—SKULL AND TUSKS OF IMPERIAL MAMMOTH, _Elephas imperator_.\r\n\r\n  In American Museum of Natural History.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—FOSSIL-BEARING CLIFFS.

Middle John Day\r\n    exposure.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, we were taken across the river in Mr. Mascall’s\r\nboat, swimming our horses. Then the packs were adjusted, and the\r\nwearisome climb up the face of the mountains began. It usually took us\r\nhalf a day to reach the summit. Then we climbed down steep slopes and\r\nover spurs of the hills, until we reached Uncle Johnnie Kirk’s\r\nhospitable cabin, a 12 × 14 structure of rough logs with a shake roof.\r\nHe kept bachelor’s hall and lived all alone, except when some cowman or\r\nfossil hunter came along. We pitched our tent near his house.\r\n\r\nNot far away there was a tract of bad lands, called the Cone, the\r\nlargest in the John Day Basin, covering, I should judge, a section of\r\nland. It was cut into the usual fantastic forms, peaks, ridges, and\r\nbattlements, and slender spires sometimes a hundred feet high, and as\r\nthickly clustered as those of some old Gothic cathedral. Their summits\r\nwere crowned with hard concretions, which protected their almost\r\nperpendicular sides from destruction by the elements.\r\n\r\nThe drainage canals spread out through this territory like the ribs of a\r\nfan, converging at the entrance, and woe to the man who chanced to be\r\ncaught in one of them during a rain, for the steep slopes shot the water\r\ndown into them with such amazing rapidity that before he could turn\r\naround he would be engulfed in fathoms of water. We always climbed up to\r\nsome high point the minute we heard the rain strike the rocks above us,\r\nand waited until the storm was over and the water had run out. A ditch\r\ncontaining twenty feet, sometimes, of water would dry up as soon as it\r\nstopped raining, so steep was the slope of its bed.\r\n\r\nI was continually impressed in this region by the power of running\r\nwater. Not only is this manifested in the mighty canyons which have been\r\ncarved out during the course of ages from the solid rock, but I stood\r\ntransfixed with astonishment once, at the mouth of the little creek in\r\nfront of Uncle Johnnie’s cabin, on finding it dammed by a mass of\r\nbasaltic rock, weighing at least twenty tons, which had been brought\r\nfrom its native hills, three miles away, by a flood of water, and left\r\nstranded here. All the side canyons that empty into the John Day River\r\nhave dumped their loads of boulders there, in some places damming the\r\nstream or creating a series of rapids.\r\n\r\nI soon found that all the ground in the fossil beds which was easy to\r\nget at had been gone over. Here and there we would run across a pile of\r\nbroken bones and a hole from which a skull had been taken. When I asked\r\nBill what he had meant by leaving the bones of the skeleton behind, he\r\nanswered, “We were only looking for heads, though we sometimes saved\r\nknucks and jints.” This accounts for the scarcity of skeletons among the\r\nfirst collections made. I saw to it that my party should care for every\r\nbone discovered.\r\n\r\nI realized then, that if we were to make our expedition a success, we\r\nshould have to climb where no one before us had dared to go. It was a\r\nserious matter to scale those almost perpendicular heights; one took\r\none’s life in one’s hand in attempting it. They were, of course,\r\nentirely bare of vegetation, and where the slope was not too steep, they\r\nwere covered with angular fragments of rock which rolled from under\r\none’s feet and were likely to send one flying into the gorge below. But\r\nI laid the situation before my two men, explaining to them that unless\r\nthey were willing to face the danger, we should have to give up the\r\nexpedition, as we had explored the safe ground without results; and they\r\ncourageously agreed to follow where I led.\r\n\r\nSo every morning we started out for a day of perilous enterprise, each\r\nwith a collecting bag over his shoulder and a well-made pick in hand.\r\nThe latter was used not only for digging out fossils, but was absolutely\r\nindispensable as an aid in climbing, and as an anchor in case we began\r\nto slip. We were never sure when we left camp in the morning that we\r\nshould all meet there at night, since a single misstep on those cliffs\r\nwould mean death or worse than death on the pitiless rocks below; but\r\nevery day we gained confidence and grew more skilful in the use of our\r\npicks.\r\n\r\nFar above the pick-marks of the fossil hunters who had preceded us, far\r\nabove the signs of the mountain sheep that inhabited these wilds, we\r\nmade our way, cutting niches for our feet as high above us as we could\r\nreach, and drawing ourselves up with bodies pressed to the rock. At each\r\nniche we rested, and scanned the face of the cliff for the point of a\r\ntooth or the end of a bone, or for one of those concretions, among the\r\nthousands that everywhere topped the pinnacles or projected from the\r\nrocky slopes, whose skull-shaped form revealed the treasure that was\r\nhidden away within. When a fossil was found we first cut out of the face\r\nof the cliff a place large enough to stand upon, and then carved out the\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nI could tell of a hundred narrow escapes from death. One day I was\r\nstanding on a couple of oblong concretions, about a foot in length, with\r\na chasm, fifty feet deep and three or four feet wide, immediately in\r\nfront of me. After I had searched carefully the surface of all the rocks\r\nin sight, I started to jump over to a narrow ledge on the other side of\r\nthe gorge. Suddenly both concretions flew from under my feet, and I was\r\nplunging head downward into the gorge when by a violent struggle in\r\nmid-air I managed to throw my elbows on the ledge; and I hung there\r\nuntil I could find a foothold and pull myself out onto solid rock.\r\n\r\nAnother time I was climbing a steep slope which was capped by a\r\nperpendicular ledge. I thought, however, that I could climb over it to\r\nthe top of a ridge that ran back into the hills, where I could find a\r\nway down. For understand, we could never go back the way we had come, as\r\nwe could not relax our muscles sufficiently to enable us to find with\r\nthe tips of our toes the niches by which we had climbed up. So we had to\r\nbe sure that we could get to the top and find a way down from there. On\r\nthis occasion I was so busy searching the face of the rock for fossils\r\nthat I worked for hours, climbing up niche after niche, without noticing\r\nvery much where I was going, until chancing to look upward, I discovered\r\nthat an escarpment of the top ledge leaned over the slope that I was\r\nscaling, rendering it impossible for me to reach the top. I fully\r\nexpected that I should have to cut out a place to sit in and wait until\r\nthe boys missed me and looked for me. They could then reach the top of\r\nthe ledge by some other way, and lower a rope to me. But I was delighted\r\nto find at last a perpendicular seam in the rocky ledge, which proved\r\nwide enough to admit my body. So I climbed to the top as a man climbs a\r\nnarrow well, with my back braced against one side and my feet planted\r\nagainst the other.\r\n\r\nBut such experiences as these, instead of making us timid, only spurred\r\nus on to more dangerous attempts. To show how reckless we became, I\r\nremember that once Bill found a skull in a perpendicular cliff of\r\nsolidified volcanic mud, the termination of a ridge that ran far back\r\ninto the hills. The skull was located about twenty feet up the face of\r\nthe cliff, and too far below the surface of the ridge to be reached from\r\nabove; so that there was no way to get at it but by scaling the cliff. I\r\ncut niches on one side, and Bill on the other, and we climbed up until\r\nwe could reach the specimen with our picks, clinging to a niche with one\r\nhand and wielding the pick with the other. I worked with my right hand\r\nand Bill with his left.\r\n\r\nThe rock was very hard, and it took a long while to hew out the\r\nspecimen. While we were at work, we heard a mountain sheep bleating for\r\nher young. By reaching up we could get our hands over the edge of the\r\ncliff, and pull ourselves up so that we could just peek over. Sure\r\nenough, the sheep was coming down the ridge toward us in great\r\nexcitement, rending the air with calls for her lamb. I began to imitate\r\nthe bleat of her offspring, and she increased her speed toward us with\r\nevery sign of relief.\r\n\r\n“What if she should butt us off?” I said to Bill, and the position we\r\nwere in, clinging to the face of the rock with our toes and fingers,\r\nmade the idea so inexpressibly funny that he began to laugh, louder and\r\nlouder the more I tried to hush him up. When I had led the sheep up to\r\nwithin ten feet of us, she concluded that we were not her lost lamb, and\r\nturning like a flash, started on a run for the mountains a mile away.\r\nOut of a side canyon came the lamb, and fell in behind its mother; and\r\nwe could see the dirt flying out behind them until they appeared to be\r\nabout the size of a rabbit and a ground squirrel.\r\n\r\nOne day Bill and I were out together in the beds, and when we got back\r\nto dinner, Jake did not show up. We were not much concerned about him,\r\nas we concluded that he had found a specimen and was digging it out; but\r\nwhen we came in at night and there was still no Jake, we made up our\r\nminds that he had either fallen and killed himself or that he was lying\r\nin some gulch with a broken limb. In great anxiety we started out into\r\nthe Bad Lands to find him.\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous enough expedition in the daytime, but doubly so at\r\nnight, and we risked our lives many times; but we did not give up until\r\nwe had made the desolate region ring with our calls. At last, about\r\nmidnight, with fear and sorrow in our heart, we returned to camp. By the\r\nmoonlight I saw what appeared to be a human form in Jake’s bed. I rushed\r\nto it and threw off the blankets, and there, sleeping peacefully, lay\r\nJake. We had a great mind to take him out into the Bad Lands and pitch\r\nhim off into a canyon. It seems that he had been to the mountains, three\r\nmiles away, where a small exposure of the John Day beds could be seen\r\nfrom camp; and when he returned and we were not in, he had not worried\r\nabout us, but had eaten his supper and gone to bed, while we were making\r\nourselves hoarse shouting for him. This incident illustrates a\r\npeculiarity of youth—its thoughtlessness as to the anxiety which it may\r\nbe causing its elders.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossil remains which we secured in these John Day beds, were\r\nthe limbs of a huge _Elotherium humerosum_, so named by Cope on account\r\nof the great process on the humerus. We found the specimen in Haystack\r\nValley, lying on its side, with its toes sticking out of the face of a\r\nslope. There were thousands of feet of volcanic rock above it. Following\r\nin with pick and shovel, we cleaned up the floor, to find, when we\r\nreached the center of the humeri and femora, that they had been cut\r\nthrough as smoothly as if it had been done with a diamond saw. I knew,\r\nof course, that there had been a fault here, and that the earth in\r\nslipping down had severed the bones. The question that interested me was\r\nwhich side had gone down and how far. If the side toward the open\r\nvalley, then the rest of the skeleton must have been destroyed by the\r\nwash, as the slope above the bones lay at an angle of 45 degrees to the\r\nfloor on which they lay. If, on the other hand, the mountain side had\r\ngone down, and the slip had not been too great, I should be able to find\r\nthe rest of the bones. Inspired by this hope, we put in several days of\r\nhard work, and were delighted to find the severed bones three feet below\r\nthe original level.\r\n\r\nWhat a shaking and trembling of the earth’s crust there must have been,\r\nwhen miles of the mountain mass slipped down three feet toward the\r\ncenter of the earth! No wonder that when a similar fault occurred at San\r\nFrancisco, the puny works of man fell in ruins. The bones of this\r\n_Elotherium_ are now on exhibition in the American Museum, which\r\npurchased the Cope collection, including the material that I secured\r\nthrough eight seasons in the field in charge of his expedition.\r\n\r\nI had found in the Cottonwood beds that lie on top of the John Day\r\nMiocene the cannon-bone, or long cylindrical foot bone, of a large\r\ncamel. As I closely studied this bone, which is composed of opposite\r\nhalves, separated by a thin septum of bone in the center, with a\r\nmedullary canal on each side, the conviction came to me that the two\r\nhalves had once been distinct, like the metacarpals and metatarsals of\r\nthe pig. With this idea in mind, I was constantly looking for a camel in\r\nthe older beds, and I cannot express my delight when one day, as I was\r\nexploring the John Day beds, I came across a skeleton which had been\r\nweathered out and lay in bold relief on the face of a slope. I knew\r\nbefore I picked up the cannon-bone that my belief was verified, and when\r\nI took up the two bones separately, the fact was proved beyond a doubt\r\nthat in this ancestor of the living form the metacarpals of the fore\r\nfoot and the metatarsals of the hind foot were respectively distinct. As\r\nthe species represented by this specimen was new to science, Professor\r\nCope named it in my honor _Paratylopus sternbergi_. A skull of this\r\nspecies was afterwards found by Dr. Wortman, and both specimens are now\r\non exhibition in the American Museum.\r\n\r\nI arrived at this conclusion with regard to the cannon-bone of the\r\nancient camel as Darwin, Marsh, and Huxley arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat the ancient horse had three toes. They recognized that the splint\r\nbones of the horse represented the side toes of rhinoceroses, one on\r\neach side of the middle metacarpals and metatarsals respectively, and\r\nthey decided that they were the remnants of side toes in the ancestor of\r\nthe horse. And later we also found a three-toed horse.\r\n\r\nI secured also in these beds the skull of a peccary and an oreodont,\r\nboth new, and used as the types of Cope’s description, and a couple of\r\ncarnivores; one, called by Cope _Archælurus debilis_, about the size of\r\nthe American panther, the other a dog about the size of a coyote. Cope\r\ngave the name _Enhydrocyon stenocephalus_ to this genus and species. A\r\nsplendid skull of the rhinoceros _Diceratherium nanum_ Marsh, was\r\nanother of my discoveries here. All the specimens, with the skull of a\r\nrodent from the same beds, are now on exhibition in the American Museum.\r\n\r\nOf course these are but a few of the many specimens secured in these\r\nbeds; hundreds are stored away in the drawers and trays of the Museum. I\r\nwas told that it would cost twenty-five dollars to get a typewritten\r\ncopy of the list of John Day fossils in the Museum. In that list are\r\nmany specimens which my party secured or which I purchased from Warfield\r\nand Day. Professor Cope once wrote me that my collection there\r\nrepresented about fifty species of extinct mammals.\r\n\r\nOne day in July I left Jake Wortman in the field and started for\r\nDayville, leading a pack pony. I intended to stay all night with Mr.\r\nMascall, leave my load of fossils, and take back a load of provisions.\r\nBill Day had lost one of the horses, and as a large band of Umatilla\r\nIndians was encamped on Fox Prairie at the summit of the mountains,\r\nabout six miles east of our camp in the Cove, he had gone off in that\r\ndirection to look for it.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the high mountain above Dayville, I could look down into\r\nthe narrow valley of the John Day. Although it was noon, there was no\r\nsmoke rising from the chimneys of the houses. The fields of wheat were\r\nripe for the cradle—they had no machines in that region, and not only\r\ncradled their grain, but threshed it with horses, who tramped it out—but\r\nno one was working in them, and there was no stock in the pastures. What\r\ncould it mean? I asked myself; and as I followed the long trail down to\r\nthe river, my heart was full of fearful forebodings. Had a pestilence\r\nkilled all these people whom I knew so well? Or had they all fled, with\r\ntheir horses and cattle, from Indians on the warpath?\r\n\r\nWithout expecting to hear a response, I called, when I reached the\r\nriver, for Mr. Mascall to come over with his boat and take me across. To\r\nmy delight, I saw him come out of his house and take the trail down to\r\nthe boat through the woods that covered the first river bottom. All the\r\nwhile that he was unlocking the boat and rowing across, I kept shouting,\r\n“What’s the trouble? Where are all the people?” But not until I had got\r\naboard with my pack and saddle, and we had started back, would he answer\r\nthe questions which I had been asking myself ever since I left the top\r\nof the mountain.\r\n\r\nIt seems that three hundred Bannocks, or Snakes, under their chosen\r\nleader, Egan, had left the Malheur Agency, several hundred miles south,\r\nand after stealing six thousand horses, mainly from the French brothers’\r\nranch, were now on their way north to join Homely, the chief of the\r\nUmatillas, at Fox Prairie. General Howard, who was in hot pursuit, had\r\nsent a courier ahead of his command to the settlers in the John Day\r\nvalley, advising them to gather at some central locality, build a\r\nstockade, and take their women and children into it for protection from\r\nthe treacherous redskins. Everyone in the valley, except Mr. Mascall and\r\nan old man who kept the mail station on Cottonwood Creek, a mile to the\r\nsouth, had taken this advice and gone to Spanish Gulch, a mining town on\r\ntop of the mountains about ten miles southwest.\r\n\r\nNear sundown Bill Day came in, having heard the news at the Indian camp.\r\nHe instantly insisted that we leave everything and go to Spanish Gulch.\r\nIt was foolish, he said, to risk our lives going back to warn Jake. On\r\nthe long trail up the mountain we should be in full sight of the South\r\nFork, down which the Indians were expected to come, and it would take us\r\nhalf a day to climb those four thousand feet and hide ourselves in the\r\ncanyons on the other side. I refused, however, to be moved by his\r\narguments. I told him that I meant to go back, and that he was to go\r\nwith me. We could not leave Jake there in camp, entirely unconscious of\r\nthe fate that might be approaching him. He knew nothing of the proximity\r\nof hostile Indians, and it was our duty to warn him.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Bill said, “I am going to look out for number one. I have not\r\nlost any Indians. If you have, go and hunt trouble. Let Jake look out\r\nfor himself.”\r\n\r\nAll my shells, perhaps three hundred, were empty, but I had plenty of\r\npowder and lead, and the best long-range rifle I had ever owned, a heavy\r\nSharp’s weighing fourteen pounds, and shooting a hundred and twenty\r\ngrains of lead and seventy grains of powder. I set to work cleaning and\r\noiling it; and then spent the whole night in front of the fireplace,\r\nmelting lead, casting bullets, and loading shells. Bill also stayed\r\nawake, and with his needle-gun kept guard at a porthole which commanded\r\na good view of the open ground around the house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I started alone on my pony to follow the trail to the\r\nCove, where Jake, unconscious of danger, was at work in the fossil beds.\r\nIt seemed an interminable journey, and I thought that there was an\r\nambuscade behind every bush and pile of rocks that guarded the road.\r\nBut, greatly relieved, I got out of sight at last in the deep canyons on\r\nthe other side, and soon saw Jake’s pony near a fossil bed and found\r\nJake himself deeply interested in a splendid discovery he had made.\r\n\r\nWhen I told him the news, he wanted to drop everything until the war was\r\nover, and fly for safety to the stockade. But no; my tent, with many\r\nfine fossils in it, was in an open valley in plain sight for miles, and\r\nwould quickly attract any marauding hostile, who might set fire to it\r\nand destroy the work of months. I insisted, therefore, upon caching, the\r\nPacific coast term for hiding, everything. So we took down the tent, and\r\nputting it, with the fossils and all the rest of the outfit, into a\r\nsecret place, we covered them with a big brush pile. Then I was ready to\r\nfly as fast as our ponies could carry us.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the river, Bill was still with Mr. Mascall, and brought\r\nover the boat. Then both men insisted that we go without further delay\r\nto the Gulch, as we had risked our lives long enough. But there was a\r\nlarge collection of valuable fossils in the log house behind Mr.\r\nMascall’s cabin, and as the specimens were wrapped in burlap, they would\r\nbe destroyed if the Indians burned down the house, which they would be\r\nsure to do if they came. I had no boxes, but I had a quantity of new\r\nlumber, which we had secured from a mill in the vicinity; so, refusing\r\nto be moved, I took off my coat and went to work sawing up the lumber\r\nand making boxes. The other men never let their guns leave their hands,\r\nand kept guard all night, expecting every moment to hear the whoop of\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nBy daylight I had every fossil neatly packed, each in a little box, and\r\nthen we all took hold, and carrying the boxes down to the first river\r\nbottom, hid them under a great grapevine, which completely covered them.\r\nAfter throwing dead leaves over our trail, I was satisfied that we had\r\ndone all that we could, and as we could not induce Mascall to abandon\r\nhis property, we left him and went over to the Gulch. We found nearly\r\nall the settlers keeping house inside the stockade, which was built of\r\npine logs and covered enough ground to hold their teams, wagons, and\r\ncattle, as well as themselves.\r\n\r\nAs I realized that it would be impossible for us to do any work in the\r\nJohn Day beds, fearing every moment to be surprised by Indians, I\r\nconcluded that this would be a good time to go to the Dalles and try to\r\nfind out what had become of the collection of Fossil Lake material which\r\nhad been sent off the year before, and had been lost somewhere. I had a\r\nreceipt for the specimens from a Mr. French, who was, I supposed, the\r\nagent for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. His letterhead read\r\n“Forwarding Agent for the O. S. N. Co.,” but I had repeatedly written to\r\nthe agent at the Dalles, and had received no answer, while Cope, from\r\nhis end of the line at Philadelphia, had sent tracers out over every\r\nroute he could think of, trying to locate the fossils.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Wood, the owner of a large herd of horses, was driving the herd to\r\na point near the Dalles for protection from the Indians, and I joined\r\nhis party. But the several hundred horses raised such a volume of dust\r\nthat, after a few days of suffocation, I concluded that I might as well\r\nlose my scalp as be choked to death, and leaving the herd, went on\r\nalone. All along the way, men, women, and children were fleeing for\r\nsafety to the Dalles, and dozens of homes and ranches were being\r\ndeserted just at the time when the people should have been saving their\r\ngrain. I never in my life saw so much excitement and fear. As many white\r\nmen were fleeing for their lives as there were Indians on the warpath,\r\nand every man of them was blaming General Howard for not having\r\nexterminated the hostiles before they started.\r\n\r\nI met the man who had hauled my Fossil Lake collection in to the Dalles,\r\nand for the first time learned the truth about them. It seems that they\r\nhad never been shipped. Mr. French simply had a warehouse, and forwarded\r\ngoods by the Steam Navigation Company, and mine had been covered up in\r\nthe warehouse and entirely forgotten. I was in splendid spirits when I\r\nknew that they were safe.\r\n\r\nHaving rescued this valuable material from the warehouse, I returned to\r\nthe Gulch without seeing an Indian, to find the people still in a state\r\nof great excitement. General Howard had sent word that the men could put\r\nthemselves under the leadership of Colonel Bernard, each citizen\r\nfurnishing his own mount and arms, but receiving his rations from the\r\nGovernment. I tried to raise a company of men to accept this offer, but\r\nnot a man cared to go. At last, heartily tired of staying in camp, I\r\nasked for a volunteer to go with me to the John Day valley to find out\r\nhow Mr. Mascall and the old man at the stage station were getting on. No\r\none would go at first, but later Mr. Leander Davis, who was for many\r\nyears a fossil hunter for Professor Marsh, agreed to go with me; and\r\npacking a horse with blankets and supplies, we started.\r\n\r\nWe were relieved to find both men well, and no sign of Indians.\r\nContinuing our journey east, we crossed the south fork of the John Day,\r\nand all doubts as to the movements of the Indians were removed. For a\r\nwide trail, cut deeply into the dry soil by six thousand horses and the\r\nthree hundred Indians who were driving them north, led down the slope\r\nand followed up the main fork on the Canyon City road.\r\n\r\nAs we sat on our horses, looking south along the heavy trail, we saw\r\nsome half-dozen horsemen coming toward us. We knew that they must have\r\nseen us, and concluded to stay where we were until we could make them\r\nout. Before long we saw the glitter of sabers and the flash of gold\r\nbuttons, and soon General Howard and his staff rode up at a gallop. I\r\nrecognized him by his brigadier general straps and by his empty sleeve.\r\nHe had lost an arm fighting to preserve the Union.\r\n\r\nWe saluted, and he asked me whether we had seen his pack train. When I\r\nanswered no, he asked me if we knew where he could find some bacon, as\r\nhe and his staff, as well as the troops behind them, had been living for\r\nthree days on fresh beef without any salt. I told him of a smokehouse\r\nacross the bridge, and he sent his scout to examine it. The man returned\r\nshortly with the report that not only was the smokehouse full of bacon,\r\nbut that the table in the dwelling house was set for a meal, with cold\r\ncoffee in the cups, bread, cold bacon, and potatoes, all ready to eat.\r\nThe people had evidently just sat down to dinner when someone had rushed\r\nin with the news that the Indians were coming, and they had all thrown\r\nback their chairs and fled for their lives.\r\n\r\nWhile the General and his staff sat down to a hearty meal, Leander and I\r\ncontinued to follow the trail. At one place, where a farmer made cheese,\r\nwe found that a number of large cheeses had been taken out into the road\r\nand rolled along for some distance with a stick. We followed up the\r\ntrail which they had made in the deep dust, and put one of them on our\r\npack. We went into one of the houses on the road, and found that the\r\nIndians had broken up all the furniture, including the sewing-machine,\r\netc. In the front room they had poured out a barrel of molasses, spread\r\nover it several sacks of flour, and stuck a little woolly dog in the\r\nmixture. The poor little fellow was dead. A little farther on, a\r\nsheepman’s house had been burned, and near by two thousand sheep had\r\nbeen mutilated and thrown into piles to die. The herders were found\r\nscalped a few days later. At one farmhouse a fine brood mare had been\r\nkilled because she could not keep up with the herd.\r\n\r\nSome days later, on the twenty-ninth of July, I believe, there was a\r\ntotal eclipse of the sun. The heavens were like brass, and there was a\r\npeculiar condition of the atmosphere such as I have never experienced\r\nbefore or since. A report was spread abroad that the Indians had\r\nreturned and burned all the farmhouses along the river. I was at the\r\ntime with Leander Davis, and we rode up to Perkins ranch, where a lot of\r\nmen had congregated and were taking turns standing guard for fear of the\r\nIndians. When we rode up they were standing about, uncertain as to what\r\nit all meant. The dogs had gone under the stoop and the chickens to\r\nroost. The air was motionless, and an unusual stillness was over\r\neverything. The men welcomed us in hushed voices.\r\n\r\nI sprang from my horse and asked Perkins whether he had any pieces of\r\nbroken glass. He said that there were plenty under the west window, and\r\nI went and got a supply, followed by all the men, who were greatly\r\nrelieved by my explanation of the phenomenon. We got a candle and\r\nblackened the pieces of glass, and watched the progress of the eclipse\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nIt had a more disquieting effect upon the hostile Indians. It seems that\r\nthe soldiers had cut them off from crossing the Columbia by capturing\r\nall the small boats and patrolling the river night and day; so that with\r\nHoward’s troops on the trail behind them, troops from Walla Walla on\r\ntheir flanks, and the river in front, they were in a bad way. Moreover,\r\nthe French brothers and the governor of Oregon had offered a reward of\r\ntwo thousand dollars for Egan’s head.\r\n\r\nThe Umatilla Indians were accused of pretending to help the whites in\r\nthe daytime, and really helping the Snakes at night. So the commander\r\nsent out a party of soldiers to capture the squaws and little children\r\nof Homely and the other chiefs and hold them as hostages for the good\r\nbehavior of their braves. When the latter asked the commander to release\r\ntheir families, the answer was given that if they would capture Egan and\r\ndeliver him up to the authorities, they would not only get back their\r\nwives and children, but would receive the two-thousand-dollar reward.\r\nOtherwise their families would still be held as hostages.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Egan had an appointment with Homely at a certain hour.\r\nAs he rode out from his camp, with a brave behind him, Homely, similarly\r\nattended, went out to meet him. When they met between the two camps,\r\nthey turned at right angles and rode toward the point agreed upon for\r\nthe powwow. But as they were riding thus, side by side, Homely, with a\r\nword to his brave, suddenly raised his rifle and shot Egan, while his\r\nbrave shot the attending Snake. They then immediately severed the heads\r\nof the dead men, and riding back with them to the whites, claimed the\r\nreward. About the same time, the eclipse came on, and the poor Snakes,\r\ndeprived of their leader, thought that the world was coming to an end,\r\nand leaving their great herd of stolen horses, fled in small bands\r\ntoward the Malheur Reservation, and were all eventually captured.\r\n\r\nThe war thus ended, as soon as I could get things in shape and my party\r\ntogether, I returned to the Cove, got my outfit and fossils, and moved\r\nover into Haystack Valley. I remained there all winter, and the next\r\nseason secured another large collection. Many of the specimens in it are\r\ndescribed by Professor Cope in Vol. III of the “Tertiary Vertebrata.” On\r\np. xxvi and the two following pages of the preface, he pays his\r\ncollectors a high compliment, which I give myself the pleasure of\r\nrepeating here in his own words: “The same year [’77] I employed Charles\r\nH. Sternberg to conduct an exploration of the Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nformations of Kansas. After a successful search, I sent Mr. Sternberg to\r\nOregon. The Tertiary formations explored in 1878 were the John Day and\r\nLoup Fork of Oregon. The John Day formation was chiefly examined on the\r\nJohn Day River and the Loup Fork beds at various points in the same\r\nregion. These yielded about fifty species, many of them represented in\r\nan admirable state of preservation.”\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning the work of his other explorers, he goes on to say:\r\n“Mr. Sternberg’s expedition of 1878 was interrupted by the Bannock war,\r\nand both himself and Mr. Wortman were compelled to leave their camp and\r\noutfit in the field and fly to a place of safety on their horses. It is\r\nevident that an enthusiastic devotion to science has actuated these\r\nexplorers of our western wilderness, financial considerations having\r\nbeen but a secondary inducement. And I wish to remark that the courage\r\nand disregard of physical comfort displayed by the gentlemen above\r\nreferred to are qualities of which their country may be proud, and are\r\nworthy of the highest commendation and of imitation in every field.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this interesting field, I wish to show my readers Cope’s\r\nfigure of the great saber-toothed tiger, _Pogonodon platycopis_ (Fig.\r\n31), which was secured in 1879 by Leander Davis. I do not remember who\r\nfirst discovered the specimen, but for weeks each of us collectors,\r\nWortman, Davis, and I, tried to devise some means of securing it The\r\nskull topped a pinnacle, perhaps thirty or forty feet high, and tapering\r\nlike the spire of a church. At the top it was only a foot in diameter.\r\nWe knew that it would not be strong enough to support the weight of a\r\nladder, and it was too steep to scale. Moreover, if we blew it up with\r\npowder, the skull, whose rows of teeth seemed to grin at us defiantly,\r\nwould be shattered to bits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—FOSSIL-BEARING CLIFFS. (After Merriam.)\r\n\r\n  Mascall Formation.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—FOSSIL-BEARING CLIFFS.

(After Coke.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy whatever method it was secured, it represented a feat of the greatest\r\npossible bravery, and Cope did only justice to Leander Davis in\r\npublishing his understanding of the manner in which it was done. That\r\ndescription is attached to the skull to-day, and thousands have read of\r\nDavis’ heroic act in securing it for science. Professor Cope says that\r\nhe cut niches and climbed to the top of the spire. My remembrance,\r\nhowever, is that he threw a rope around the spire and let it settle down\r\nto where he thought the rock would be strong enough to support his\r\nweight. He then climbed up hand over hand to the loop, stood erect,\r\npicked up the skull, and without putting any pressure on the rock, got\r\nback to his rope and down to safety below. He then secured the rope by\r\njerking off the top of the pinnacle.\r\n\r\nIt matters little how he got the skull, but I am ready to testify that\r\nit was the bravest undertaking I ever saw accomplished in the John Day\r\nbeds; and as long as science lasts, this noble specimen of one of the\r\nlargest tigers that ever lived should be associated with the name of\r\nLeander Davis. I am glad that the great dike across the Cove is named\r\nafter him also.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that urges a man to risk his life in these precipitous fossil\r\nbeds? I can answer only for myself, but with me there were two motives,\r\nthe desire to add to human knowledge, which has been the great motive of\r\nmy life, and the hunting instinct, which is deeply planted in my heart.\r\nNot the desire to destroy life, but to see it. The man whose love for\r\nwild animals is most deeply developed is not he who ruthlessly takes\r\ntheir lives, but he who follows them with the camera, studies them with\r\nloving sympathy, and pictures them in their various haunts. It is thus\r\nthat I love creatures of other ages, and that I want to become\r\nacquainted with them in their natural environments. They are never dead\r\nto me; my imagination breathes life into “the valley of dry bones,” and\r\nnot only do the living forms of the animals stand before me, but the\r\ncountries which they inhabited rise for me through the mists of the\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe mind fills with awe as it journeys back to those far-distant lands.\r\nStop, reader, and think! In this John Day region, ten thousand feet, or\r\nnearly two miles, of sedimentary and volcanic rock lie above the\r\nNiobrara Group of the Cretaceous, from which I dug last summer the\r\nbeautiful skull of a Kansas mosasaur, _Platecarpus coryphæus_, which\r\nlies before me now, its glistening teeth as perfect as in the days when\r\nthey dripped with the blood of its victims. How many ages were those ten\r\nthousand feet in building? How long has it taken the running water, with\r\nits tools of sand and gravel, to carve out the Grande Coulée and the\r\nriver valley, and expose all the various formations, with their records\r\nof the life of the past? And yet all this has taken place since my\r\nmosasaur, which seems to watch me as I write, fought its last battle and\r\nsank to rest beneath the waves of the Cretaceous sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n           MY FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE PERMIAN OF TEXAS, 1882\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first expedition to the Permian of Texas was made in 1882, while I\r\nwas in charge of collecting parties for the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology of Harvard University.\r\n\r\nI left the station at North Cambridge about the fifteenth of December,\r\nand reached Dallas on the twenty-first, with the address of A. R.\r\nRoessler; but I was told at the post-office that there was no such man\r\nand no such address in the city. I had been depending absolutely upon\r\nthe information which I hoped to receive from this Mr. Roessler, as I\r\nmyself had no more idea as to the whereabouts of the Permian beds than a\r\nnew-born child. Dr. Hayden had written me to follow up Red River until I\r\nfound the red beds, which had colored the whole flood-plain of the\r\nvalley, and I had seen the red mud at Texarkana as I entered the state;\r\nbut it would take years to explore the whole valley of that great\r\nstream. I felt that I had come upon a wild-goose chase, and I suppose\r\nshowed my dismay in my face, for the postmaster asked if he could help\r\nme. I told him my troubles, and he said that there was a man in town, a\r\nProfessor W. A. Cummins, who had been Cope’s assistant the year before.\r\n\r\nGreatly cheered, I went to the man’s house posthaste, to be met at the\r\ndoor by his wife, who told me that the Professor was in Austin.\r\nWhereupon my spirits dropped below zero again. But if a girl’s face is\r\nher fortune, so is a man’s sometimes, for I gained Mrs. Cummins’\r\nsympathy at once. When I told her why I had come to Texas, she answered,\r\n“Why, I was with Professor Cummins on his expedition to the Permian\r\nbeds,” and proceeded to give me all the information which I thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nI learned that they had made their headquarters at Seymour, in Baylor\r\nCounty, between the Brazos and Wichita rivers, and I supposed that\r\nanyone in Seymour could tell me the exact localities from which the\r\nfossils came. Later I found to my sorrow that this was not the case; and\r\nI wasted months of careful exploration over barren beds before I found\r\nthe horizon that yielded the wonderful batrachians and reptiles of which\r\nI had come in search.\r\n\r\nMuch elated, I took the train for Gordon, a cattlemen’s town south of\r\nSeymour, and the point nearest to it by rail. I arrived there on\r\nChristmas Eve. I was the only passenger to leave the cars and was\r\nwelcomed by about twenty cowboys, who were just beginning to paint the\r\ntown red. The leader asked me where I came from, and I answered\r\npromptly, “From Boston.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you want to go?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“To the best hotel in town,” said I.\r\n\r\n“All right!” he said. “We’ll take you there.” And sure enough, they did.\r\nThey formed in double file and put me in the middle of their ranks. Then\r\nthe two men ahead of me laid their Winchesters over my shoulders from in\r\nfront, and the two men behind crossed these guns with their own, and at\r\nthe word, “Fire at will!” the whole command opened fire and kept it up\r\nall the way to the hotel. There a girl appeared, carrying a lamp with no\r\nchimney, and the men, facing the porch, allowed me to go into the\r\nwaiting room. I turned first, and made a little speech, thanking them\r\nfor their kind reception and remarking that if I were not so poor, I\r\nshould stand treat for the whole crowd. This satisfied them, and\r\nshouting “All right!” they went off to continue their nonsense until\r\nthey were all drunk.\r\n\r\nI hired the son of the hotel keeper, a Mr. Hamman, put my baggage in his\r\nwagon, and started on the journey north to my headquarters at Seymour,\r\nwhich we reached eight days later. Here I got off the track again, for\r\nalthough everyone in town knew Professor Cummins, no one could tell\r\nwhere he had found his fossils. “Over in the brakes,” was all the\r\ninformation anyone could give. Finally a man named Turner asked me to\r\ncome over to his cattle range on the middle fork of the Wichita, as the\r\ncountry was cut up into canyons and ridges and denuded, so that I should\r\nbe likely to find fossils. He knew of some mastodon bones in the\r\nvicinity, he said. So I went with him.\r\n\r\nAt one place the road led us across the narrows, where there is scarcely\r\nroom for a wagon road between the brakes of the Brazos and the Big\r\nWichita. Looking south, shallow ravines led to the valley of the Brazos,\r\nwhile to the north were deep gulches and mounds capped with white ledges\r\nof gypsum with red beds of clay below. I had reached at last the red\r\nbeds of Texas.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phenomenon is to be observed here—the bed of the Big\r\nWichita is one hundred and seventy-five feet lower than that of the\r\nBrazos. North of the Brazos, along a line that extends through Baylor\r\nCounty, the country has been lifted up and disturbed by pressure from\r\nbelow, while south of that line, the only disturbance in the strata has\r\nbeen due to erosion. Everywhere in the red beds of the Wichita valley\r\nare signs of an elevation of the earth’s crust, and for miles down the\r\nstream one comes upon miniature mountains with the strata turned up at\r\nall angles. The river valley occupies a fault.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful indeed was the view when we got in sight of the brakes of\r\nthe Big Wichita. As far as the eye could see stretched miniature Bad\r\nLands, with rounded knobs, deep canyons, bluffs, and ravines. The\r\nprevailing color of the strata was Indian red, but beds of white gypsum\r\nand of greenish sandstone relieved the sameness. Sometimes seams of\r\ngypsum filled cracks in the strata, forming dikes a few inches in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nBetween the hills grew patches of grass, a welcome sight to our horses,\r\nfor we had passed through a country devoid of vegetation. The fall\r\nbefore, the army worm had eaten the ground clean of everything that was\r\neatable. We pitched our camp near a ditch that had been cut through the\r\nsediment which overspread the flood-plain.\r\n\r\nThe day after pitching camp, I heard George Hamman calling me, and\r\ncrossing the bridge, saw him beckoning me to follow him. He gathered his\r\npockets full of cobblestones as he went along, and when he reached the\r\nedge of the ditch a little way below the crossing, he began to throw the\r\nstones at something. I ran up to him, and heard the rattle of snakes,\r\nbut could not see any until, resting my hand on his shoulder, I lifted\r\nmyself on my toes and saw, on the other side of the ditch, a cave with a\r\nbroad floor. Lying singly or knotted together in gorgon spheres, with\r\nheads sticking out in all directions, were hundreds of large\r\nrattlesnakes, which had come out of the cracks in the earth to bask in\r\nthe sun on this sheltered floor. They had become terribly irritated by\r\nthe blows of the stones which Hamman was hurling at them, and were\r\nrattling in chorus and striking out in all directions, biting themselves\r\nand each other. Suddenly one rattled in the high grass at our very feet,\r\nand looking down, we saw a big fellow making ready to strike. As quick\r\nas a flash Hamman threw himself over backward, knocking me down, and the\r\ninstant he touched the ground, turned a complete somerset. While I lay\r\nthere, overcome with laughter, he turned two more, and finding himself\r\non the road, started for camp on a run. I was too hysterical with\r\nlaughter to help myself, and lay there, while the snake continued to\r\nsound its rattle and dart out its forked tongue, swinging its head back\r\nand forth above its coiled body. When George saw my predicament, he was\r\nbrave enough to come back and pull me out of reach of his lordship’s\r\nfangs. Then we were mean enough to kill him. He measured five feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—SKELETON OF FIN-BACKED LIZARD, _Naosaurus claviger_.\r\n\r\n  Collected by Charles Sternberg in the Permian Beds of the Big Wichita\r\n    Valley, Baylor Co., Texas, in the winter of 1896.

(From model in American Museum of\r\n    Natural History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe valley contained thousands of wild turkeys, and it was a fine sight\r\nto see them come down in great droves from the hills at night to roost\r\nin the trees below. On the level prairie there were many antelope, also;\r\nand wild cats and coyotes were seen nearly every day. I remember one\r\nday, when crossing a low level prairie covered with bushes a couple of\r\nfeet in height, seeing at my left a coyote which was running along in a\r\nstraight line, with its nose pointed toward a certain spot, like a\r\npointer dog after a prairie chicken. My interest was aroused, and to\r\nincrease my curiosity, I caught sight of a short-tailed cat, the\r\nCanadian lynx, crawling along the ground in the same direction. I knew\r\nthat they were both trailing some prey which each, unknown to the other,\r\nhad scented, and imagining that it might be a calf, I shouted, as I did\r\nnot want to see it torn to pieces. This startled the cat, and drove her\r\noff at a tangent to her trail. The coyote continued his course, but did\r\nnot stop, for a Texas cow had run to the point toward which he was\r\ntraveling, and stood with lowered horns, ready to repel his assault;\r\nwhile her calf sprang up and deliberately proceeded to take advantage of\r\nthe situation to get his dinner.\r\n\r\nIn this region, as in the Kansas chalk beds, the question of water gave\r\nus a great deal of trouble. All the water in the river is that which\r\ngoes by the name of alkali in the West, being thoroughly impregnated\r\nwith salt and other mineral ingredients. There are, moreover, no wells\r\nor springs in the red beds. The surface rock is porous, and the water\r\nsinks through it to the compact gray beds below, from which it drains\r\noff into the river. These gray beds are some distance below the surface,\r\nand so far as I know, have never been reached in digging for water. One\r\nis, therefore, forced to depend upon rain water. This is collected\r\neither in artificial tanks built by the cattlemen, or in natural tanks,\r\nsometimes along the creek beds, but usually in the flood-plain in old\r\ncreek beds, where the fine red mud has been puddled by cattle, perhaps,\r\nor in the olden days, by buffalo. These ponds hold water for years,\r\nalthough often they become very foul from the cattle that frequent and\r\nwade into them in summer to get away from the flies.\r\n\r\nIt is an odd sight to a stranger in the valley of the Big Wichita to see\r\nthe rain come rushing down the hills. It soon becomes as thick as cream\r\nwith the fine red clay, and to think of depending upon such water for\r\ndrinking and cooking purposes is revolting to one who remembers the\r\nsparkling springs and clear wells of the East or any mountainous\r\ncountry. During quiet days, when the wind was not blowing, the red mud\r\nwould settle in the bottom of the tanks, but one had to be careful not\r\nto pull out one’s pail suddenly or the water would instantly thicken\r\nwith mud from the bottom.\r\n\r\nNothing would settle this water but boiling it, although it might be\r\ncleared a little by the pulp of cactus leaves. I have sometimes gone to\r\nthe trouble of peeling the broad leaves of the prickly pear and beating\r\nthem into a mucilaginous pulp to throw into a pail of muddy water. The\r\nmud attached itself to this material and sank with it to the bottom; but\r\neven then the clarified liquid remaining on top did not make a very\r\ntempting drink. I soon got used to the thick red water, however, as had\r\nthe other inhabitants of the country, and for six seasons drank it\r\nthankfully, when I was thirsty. When a man is thirsty, he drinks first\r\nand tastes the water afterwards. I once asked an old cowman what he did\r\nfor drinking water on the range, and he answered, “Wherever and whatever\r\na cow can drink, I can.” And cows will take filthy water, if they can\r\nget no other.\r\n\r\nAll that winter I worked in these desolate beds, walking over thousands\r\nof acres of denuded rock, searching without success for the fossil\r\nfields. The dominant color of these beds is red, but the tints vary so\r\nthat the eye is dazzled and wearied by the constant change. There are\r\ncountless concretions too, all of which had to be looked over. If fine\r\nspecimens had rewarded the labor, all would have been well, but I know\r\nof no work more trying than spending day after day in a fruitless\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nAt last Hamman, having fattened his horses on two-dollar corn, started a\r\nquarrel with me, so that he might have an excuse for deserting me, and\r\ndrove off with the team, which I had hired for some time longer, leaving\r\nme alone, thirty miles from town. Fortunately, however, I found a good,\r\nhonest Irishman, Pat Whelan by name, who became not only a splendid\r\nassistant, but a true friend. Poor fellow! I learned a few years ago\r\nthat he had frozen to death in Montana.\r\n\r\nOne warm, sultry day I sent him in to town for provisions. I had no tent\r\nat that time, but he left me the wagon sheet, and I had camped on the\r\nsouth side of a large tree, which was so effectually covered with green\r\nbriers as to be an almost impenetrable defense against the north wind.\r\n\r\nI was in the field after Mr. Whelan left me, and noticing the Texas\r\ncattle coming from the prairie to the heavy timber, I concluded,\r\nalthough there was not a cloud in sight, that they had scented a\r\nnorther. Rushing to camp, I began rapidly to make preparations for the\r\nstorm. First I cut a couple of crotches and sank them well into the\r\nground on the south side of the brier-covered tree. Then I put up a\r\nridgepole and stretched over it the wagon sheet, which I fastened\r\nsecurely to the ground on either side. I also heaped dirt on the edges,\r\nto keep out the snow. I thus had a dog tent, opening toward the northern\r\nbarrier and toward the south.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of fallen wood lying about, and I devoted every moment\r\nand all my strength to cutting it up and dragging it to the tent. I must\r\nhave got several cords together before I heard the wind howling in the\r\nheavy timber to the north. I piled up this supply of fuel at the opening\r\ntoward the green brier thicket, and built a big fire at the mouth of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nSoon an awful storm was upon me, all alone, thirty miles from any human\r\nhabitation. How the wind moaned through the creaking branches! A dense\r\ndarkness spread like a pall over the heavens, and the shrieks and wails\r\nof the tempest echoed through the woods like the cries of lost souls.\r\nThen snow and sleet began to fall in fitful gusts, and beat upon the\r\nthin canvas that was my only shelter. At such a time a man loses much of\r\nhis confidence in himself. Pretty small I felt myself when measured with\r\nthat storm, which bent the great cottonwoods and elms like reeds before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, tired out with my unwonted exertions, I fell asleep.\r\nWhenever the fire sank down and the cold became severe, I roused myself\r\nand piled fresh fuel on the dying embers, and when they blazed up again,\r\ndropped off once more. Three days and three nights that norther lasted.\r\nI understood then why the people of the Southland speak of them as they\r\ndo and dread their coming. I never once left my shelter until it\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\nPoor Pat Whelan! He had lost his horses in the storm, and being sure\r\nthat I would freeze to death if he could not get back to me, he had\r\nspent every hour of daylight looking for them. What he must have\r\nsuffered in that awful gale, while I was safe and comfortable!\r\n\r\nMy readers would grow weary if I told the whole story of that winter’s\r\nsearch. There were so few results that I became thoroughly disheartened\r\nand anxious to give up the fight and go home, where my wife and dear\r\nbaby were waiting for me. There was further cause for discouragement in\r\nthe fact that Pat had only agreed to stay with me until spring plowing\r\nbegan, and the time for that was rapidly approaching. But I would not\r\ngive up. So we worked on down the stream toward the Fort Sill cattle\r\ntrail, traveling on an average twenty miles a day on foot, with the\r\nrecord “Nothing” in my notebook night after night.\r\n\r\nBut on the eleventh of February, after forty days of unceasing effort, I\r\ndiscovered below the forks of the Big Wichita a somewhat different\r\nhorizon from that of the beds over which I had been working so\r\npersistently without success. Some of the beds in this region are\r\ncomposed of red clay, with small irregular concretions that are piled in\r\nheaps at the base of the hills and roll under one’s feet, rendering\r\ntravel difficult In other strata are deposits of small nodules, held\r\ntogether by silica. These nodules are of various colors, and where held\r\nsecurely and ground down, make beautiful mosaics. Then there are beds of\r\ngreenish sandstone, laid down in thin layers; and in these beds, for the\r\nfirst time since I came to Texas, I found the remains of a Permian\r\nvertebrate. My notes say: “Although it is not wise to shout before I am\r\nout of the woods, yet I feel very much encouraged, and I earnestly hope\r\nfor the success I have worked for. I have evidently worked too high in\r\nthe red beds to find fossils.”\r\n\r\nOn the second day in these beds, I found fragments of the great\r\nsalamander _Eryops_, and on the twenty-second of February, I found the\r\nfirst specimen that I had ever seen of the long-spined reptile,\r\n_Dimetredon_. Of this last I got seventy-five pounds of bones and\r\nmatrix, preserved in iron ore concretions. The teeth are long, recurved,\r\nand serrated. I knew little then about these most ancient of all the\r\nvertebrates that it has been my fortune to collect, but I shall have\r\nmore to say about them later. The authorities now place the time when\r\nthese animals lived twelve million years away. Indeed, “God is not slack\r\nas some men count slackness, one day is with the Lord as a thousand\r\nyears, and a thousand years as one day.”\r\n\r\nThe only way in which we can realize the lapse of millions of years is\r\nby a study of the work which nature has accomplished in them, depositing\r\nvast strata, lifting them up into mountain ranges, and carving out in\r\nthem flood-plains and mighty canyons. More interesting still is a study\r\nof the countless forms of life which, in ever-varying groups, have each\r\nin turn dominated sea and earth and air. First, as here in Texas, the\r\nbatrachians reigned supreme, a race of creatures which were supplied\r\nwith both gills and lungs, so that they could live both on land and in\r\nwater. Then came the reptiles, and later still dawned the Age of\r\nMammals, with man as the crowning work of the Creator’s hands.\r\n\r\nI was now at last in the fossiliferous beds and secured some fine\r\nmaterial. Unfortunately about this time Pat gave notice that he would\r\nsoon be obliged to leave me. I should then have no team, and to work in\r\nthese fossil beds without a means of transportation would be as useless\r\nas to attempt to dig up a forest with a hoe. I had, however, sent north\r\nfor an assistant, a Mr. Wright, and after hunting for me a day and a\r\nhalf in the brakes of the Big Wichita, he finally arrived in camp.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of March a violent norther struck us. We were better off\r\nfor protection than we had been, however, as my tent had at last arrived\r\nfrom Kansas; and although only an A-tent, it kept out the storms of\r\nsleet and snow that fell for three days. During all that time the cattle\r\nremained without food in the dense woods. Such times as this, when we\r\nwere confined to the close quarters of our tent and could accomplish\r\nnothing but keeping ourselves warm, are in my opinion the most\r\nuncomfortable which the fossil hunter is called upon to endure.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of March, the sun rose bright and clear upon a scene of\r\nsurprising beauty. Every tree, bush, and blade of grass on the red beds\r\nwas covered with a milky white ice, whose silvery luster was set with\r\ninnumerable sparkling gems. It was glorious at sunrise, but as the\r\nmorning advanced, the snow and ice began to melt, leaving patches of red\r\nand white over the Bad Lands, and by noon had entirely disappeared. The\r\nhills rapidly dried, as the thick red water sought the drainage canals,\r\nand we were soon at work once more.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution against the very difficulty which I had encountered,—I\r\nmean the impossibility of keeping a man and team with me,—I had obtained\r\nfrom the Secretary of War, through the efforts of Professor Alexander\r\nAgassiz, a letter of introduction to the commanders of western posts,\r\nrequesting them to assist me by every means in their power not\r\ninconsistent with the public service. With this letter from the\r\nHonorable Robert T. Lincoln, a son of our martyred President, I started\r\nout on the twelfth of March for Fort Sill, on a pony hired from a livery\r\nstable. I was assured that it was only sixty miles to the Fort, and that\r\nthe pony could easily take me there in a day, but I soon found that he\r\nwas just off grass, and weak and thin. I also discovered, after night\r\nhad overtaken me, that I had been put on the wrong cattle trail. I\r\nreached a house in the evening, that of a school-teacher, who, because\r\nof his having had some education and possessing the ability to talk\r\nintelligently, was known in that region as “Windy” Turner, in\r\ndistinction from “Bull” Turner, a cowman. I found him to be a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he gave me directions as to how to reach the old trail\r\nthat led to the Fort. I was to go to Wagoner’s cattle camp, where the\r\ntrail crossed Beaver Creek, and spend the night there. I traveled nearly\r\nall day, and reached the ranch building, the only house I had seen since\r\nI left the school-teacher’s, only to find the camp deserted. Not a man\r\nnor a cow was in sight. As I had had no lunch, I was very hungry, and\r\nthis being my first visit to this region, I did not know where to turn\r\nfor food and shelter. At last, however, I saw a horseman coming toward\r\nme from the northeast, and rode to meet him. He was a cowboy. I inquired\r\nwhere Wagoner had gone, and learned that he had left a few days before\r\nfor the Indian Territory. I was told, moreover, that the nearest place\r\nat which I could get a meal was back on Coffee Creek, which I had left\r\nin the morning. When I complained of being cold and hungry and of not\r\nliking to sleep in my saddle blanket on the ground without supper, the\r\ncowboy replied that he had not had a morsel to eat for three days and\r\nthat he had slept for three nights in his saddle blanket. After that I\r\nsaid no more.\r\n\r\nI was unwilling to return all the way back to the hospitable roof that\r\nhad sheltered me the night before, and continued my journey, with no\r\nexpectation of coming upon a human habitation until I reached Red River\r\nthe next night. It is hard to express my delight, therefore, when, upon\r\nreaching the divide between Beaver Creek and Red River, I saw a lot of\r\ntents, some distance to the right of the trail. I hurried to the\r\nencampment, and found that it belonged to the locating engineer of the\r\nDenver and Fort Worth Railroad. When I told the young man from whom I\r\nhad obtained this information that I wanted to see the engineer, he\r\ngrinned (I was not a very pleasant-looking individual, covered as I was\r\nwith the dust of travel), but he opened the door of the tent and said,\r\n“Here’s a man who wants to see you.”\r\n\r\nAs the occupant of the tent came forward, I presented to him my letter\r\nof introduction from the Secretary of War; and I saw the grin disappear\r\nfrom the face of my guide as the engineer shook hands with me cordially,\r\nand remarking, “That is a good enough letter of introduction for me,”\r\nplaced himself at my service. When I told him that my pony and I were\r\nhungry, he instructed the man who had expected to see me refused the\r\ncourtesies of the camp to get up a good supper for me and to care for my\r\npony. Then, inviting me to make myself at home, he entertained me\r\nroyally, and after I had made a hearty meal, opened a bale of new woolen\r\nblankets, and provided me with a most comfortable bed in his own tent. I\r\nhope if Major J. F. Menette sees this story, he will accept at this late\r\nday my thanks for his kindly treatment.\r\n\r\nThe next night I reached the crossing on Red River, where I found a\r\nhouse and stayed all night. The next day, about nightfall I crossed Cach\r\nCreek, and saw at my right, in a bend of the creek, an elevated “bench”\r\non which a tepee was pitched. There were two Indians standing about, one\r\na large, fleshy, good-natured man, the other thin, with large, prominent\r\ncheek bones, a typical Comanche. A large flock of children ran out to\r\ngreet me. I must confess that I felt a little uneasy at being so\r\nentirely alone and at the mercy of these Indians, but I made the best of\r\nit, and as several turkeys were lying on the ground, I told the\r\ngood-natured man that I wanted his squaw to cook me one for supper. This\r\nshe proceeded to do, removing the breast and putting it on a wooden spit\r\nwhich she stuck in the ground before a large bed of coals and constantly\r\nturned until the meat was done. This, with a cup of coffee which she\r\nmade me and the bread crumbs from my lunch, gave me quite a meal. I was\r\ntoo hungry to be fastidious.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were roasting camus, the bulb of the wild hyacinth, which\r\ngrew plentifully in the creek bottom. They had dug a pit five feet deep\r\nand three in diameter and kindled a fire at the bottom, using at least a\r\ncord of wood to heat thoroughly the surrounding ground. The ashes were\r\nthen scraped out, and the walls plastered with a mortar of mud, over\r\nwhich green grass was thickly strewn to prevent the bulbs from burning.\r\nThe bulbs were then put in and covered with grass and mud, and a fire\r\nbuilt on top of them. The next morning they were done, and were as much\r\nrelished by these Indian children as popcorn or peanuts by the whites. I\r\ntasted some. They had a sweetish taste, a little like sweet potatoes,\r\nbut they were so full of sand that my teeth were not strong enough to\r\ngrind them up.\r\n\r\nI put off going to bed until late, as I dreaded sleeping in the high\r\ngrass where I had left my saddle. But at last the children, who had been\r\namusing me, went off to bed, and I decided to go too. I spread half my\r\nsaddle blanket under me, and with my saddle for a pillow was just dozing\r\noff when I heard a rustle in the dead grass, and the thin Indian, whom I\r\ndisliked, stuck his head almost into my face. He had something in his\r\nhands which he wanted to swap with me for some of my property, and the\r\nmore I argued, the more determined he was to trade. He wanted my pony,\r\nmy Winchester, everything I had, and I was afraid that he would take\r\nthem whether or no. At last, however, he left, crawling through the\r\ngrass as he had come; but I was just dropping off to sleep, when I heard\r\nthe snake-like rustle again. I was getting mad by that time, and when\r\nthe Indian parted the tall grass and peered through the opening, he\r\nfaced the muzzle of my gun, while I told him with much vehemence that if\r\nhe did not go about his business and let me get to sleep, I would bore a\r\nhole through him. This had the desired effect, and but for the cold,\r\nwhich wakened me often, I slept in peace the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nI was wakened in the morning by a shot, and a wild turkey fell from a\r\ntree near where I had been sleeping. They were so tame and abundant that\r\nthey roosted in camp. The jolly Indian was anxious to earn another\r\nquarter, and as I had ordered turkey for supper, he had concluded that I\r\nwanted one for breakfast. I was not quite so hungry this morning, and\r\ndetected the Indian smell which is left on everything they touch; but I\r\nmade a brave attempt not to show my disgust to my host.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, as I started out for the trail, a boy of fourteen\r\nwalked down with me and stood talking, with his hands tangled in my\r\npony’s mane. I had given him some tobacco, and he was smoking a\r\ncigarette which he had made with a dry leaf. At our feet the path\r\ndivided and encircled a little mound of earth covered with buffalo\r\ngrass. When the boy had finished his smoke, he threw the still burning\r\nstump into this dead grass, which was damp with dew and sent up a dense\r\ncolumn of smoke. This was all done so naturally that I thought nothing\r\nof it until I got up on the level prairie, where I could see for miles\r\nahead. As far as the eye could reach, column after column of smoke was\r\nrising through the still morning air. It was thirty miles from the\r\ncrossing at Cach Creek to Fort Sill, yet when I presented my letter to\r\nMajor Guy Henry in the office at nine o’clock the next morning, the\r\nfirst question he asked was “Did you leave the crossing at Cach Creek\r\nabout sunrise yesterday morning?” And when I answered that I had, he\r\nsaid that probably about ten or fifteen minutes after I left the creek,\r\nthe Comanche chief had received notice by smoke signal that one man was\r\ncoming over the trail toward the Fort.\r\n\r\nIn coming to Fort Sill, I had inadvertently come from one department\r\ninto another, and the major had no power to send men out of his\r\ndepartment without orders from General Sheridan, the commanding general\r\nof the Army. So I had to wait at Fort Sill until the matter could be\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nThe southern cowboys, who hated the army blue and the darky soldiers who\r\nwere stationed at the Fort, were doing all that they could to irritate\r\nthe officers. While the latter were at dinner and the soldiers off duty,\r\na squad of cowboys would ride into the post across the well-kept grass\r\non the parade grounds up to the flagstaff, and fire at the Stars and\r\nStripes. Another of their tricks was to shoot off the glass insulators\r\nfrom the government telegraph lines which connect the Fort with the\r\nheadquarters at Leavenworth and with the Department of the Gulf. They\r\nhad just accomplished this piece of mischief when I arrived at the Fort,\r\nand before the major could communicate with General Pope, Commander of\r\nthe Department of the Missouri, in which Fort Sill was situated, he had\r\nto send out the signal sergeant to repair the line.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, all was arranged, and by general order, Corporal\r\nBromfield, three privates, a six-mule team, and a wagon with a white\r\nteamster, and fifty days’ rations, were detailed for my use. I started\r\nout with this escort, elated by the knowledge that I now had men and\r\nmeans of transportation upon which I could depend.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a lovely drive from Fort Sill to Red River. We were rarely\r\nout of sight of the impressive Wichita Mountains, which rise from a sea\r\nof green plains like an islet in a lake. We reached the river on the\r\nsecond day, and had a mile of sand to pull through. At one time I\r\nthought that we would go down in the treacherous quicksands, but our\r\nmagnificent team of dark-colored mules and the skill of the teamster\r\ncarried us safely over. I have since seen, in the sands of this same\r\nriver, holes ten feet deep which had been dug to rescue wagons loaded\r\nwith valuable goods, that had sunk down to bedrock during high water.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the beds of the Big Wichita, we worked both Indian and\r\nCoffee creeks, a few miles apart. Here at last, after so much toil and\r\nso many hardships, I found myself in the very center of the\r\nfossil-bearing strata, and secured a number of fine specimens, among\r\nthem the great salamander _Eryops_, the wonderful fin-backed lizard\r\n_Naosaurus_, that peculiar batrachian _Diplocaulus_, and other forms.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the fossil beds, I showed Corporal Bromfield where I\r\nwanted him to pitch my wall tent, and went into the field with Mr.\r\nWright, in search of fossils. When I returned at night, I found that the\r\ncorporal had pitched my tent on a level and his own A-tent as close to\r\nit as he possibly could. “This will never do,” I said to myself.\r\n“Discipline will go to the dogs, if I allow such close companionship.”\r\nSo I ordered him to take down his tent and pitch it a hundred yards\r\naway, and to follow this rule in future. The soldiers were very\r\nindignant, but they obeyed orders. As a general rule I found that I\r\ncould handle them, although there were a few breaches of discipline.\r\n\r\nI was so unfortunate on this expedition as to have my tent burned, with\r\nnearly all my personal property. When the men got to the flaming tent,\r\nthe first thing they did was to cut the guy-ropes and let it blow over.\r\nThey then, at my request, brought water and threw it on the burning\r\nsacks that held the fossils. This saved the fossils, but to do so we had\r\nto let everything else go.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of April, we started with our load for Decatur, the\r\nnearest railroad point. We took the Henrietta road, and camped on the\r\nLittle Wichita, where, in the sandy shales of the Upper Carboniferous or\r\nPermian, we found a locality rich in the fossil flora of that region. We\r\nsecured a number of large fern fronds, etc.\r\n\r\nWild turkey were, as usual, abundant. Lee Irving, one of the escort,\r\nkilled a hen and gobbler, and gave us a change from our customary diet\r\nof bacon. On the fourth of May, after a long journey, we plowed through\r\nthe valley named, and well named, the Big Sandy, and passing through\r\ngroves of splendid live oaks, pecans, water elms, and locusts, reached\r\nDecatur, the terminus of the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad. Here I\r\ndelivered to the agent my precious load of fossils, which had cost me so\r\nmuch expense, labor, and anxiety, and set out on the return trip to Fort\r\nSill; where, on the twelfth of May, after a journey without incident, I\r\nturned over my command to Major Henry. The next time I heard of this\r\nsplendid officer, he was a brigadier general in command of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n    EXPEDITIONS IN THE TEXAS PERMIAN FOR PROFESSOR COPE, 1895, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1895, sixteen years after my last expedition for\r\nProfessor Cope, I was employed by him to make further explorations in\r\nthe brakes of the Big Wichita. My assistant and cook was a farmer, Frank\r\nGalyean by name, who lived on Coffee Creek on the Vernon road,\r\ntwenty-five miles north of Seymour. I camped a mile above his house on\r\nthe west branch of the creek at Willow Springs, a favorite camping\r\nground, as it was one of the few places in which water was always to be\r\nfound. To the west rose Table Mountain, a hill several hundred feet\r\nhigh, and mountains of the same height extended in a southwesterly\r\ndirection to Indian Creek, about four miles from camp.\r\n\r\nI worked for several weeks on Indian Creek and Coffee Creek with very\r\npoor returns, but on the nineteenth of September, Mr. Galyean, who was\r\nof a sanguine temperament, announced that he had discovered the complete\r\nskeleton of a huge beast. So, filled with high ropes, I followed his\r\nlead along the rough face of the mountains, until at last, when we were\r\ncompletely exhausted by the ruggedness of the way, he pointed out a pile\r\nof the weathered and broken bones of a species so common that they were\r\nnot worth picking up.\r\n\r\nDropping in a moment from my hill of expectancy into a slough of\r\ndespond, I turned homeward, Mr. Galyean, who was as disappointed as I\r\nwas, leading the way to a short cut through a gap in the mountains. As\r\nhe got on the trail, which had been made by animals on their way to the\r\nspring, he stooped and picked up something, remarking, “Why, here’s a\r\nbone!” I took it, and was astonished to find it a complete skull,\r\ncovered with a hard siliceous matrix from a heavy bed of Indian red\r\nclay, which was completely covered with concretions. I had never\r\ncarefully explored this horizon, as I had taken it for granted that it\r\nwas barren. And I suppose that other collectors had imagined the same,\r\nfor although it was within a mile of Willow Springs, where Boll and\r\nCummins and other collectors had camped through a series of years, I was\r\nthe first to discover this deposit of extinct animals.\r\n\r\nWe followed the trail over a slight rise into an amphitheater a couple\r\nof acres in extent, and then over a higher rise into another, a little\r\nlarger, carved out of the mountain side and entirely denuded of soil.\r\nThese two amphitheaters proved to be the richest fossil beds I ever\r\ndiscovered in the Permian of Texas. I quote the following entry from my\r\nnotebook regarding this discovery: “After finding the perfect skull\r\ndiscovered by Galyean, we at once got into the richest ground I have\r\never seen in these beds. I got a perfect skull, and Galyean another. We\r\nhave worked too low, it seems. This rich bone bed is on top of the beds\r\nI have been working, at the heads of the ravines that cut into the face\r\nof the mountains. The concretions in which the bones are preserved are\r\nin red clay, and are of greenish and other colors.”\r\n\r\nIn my excitement over this rich find, I forgot my disgust with Galyean\r\nfor leading me on a wild-goose chase, forgot how tired I was, forgot my\r\ndinner, forgot everything, and set to work at once collecting skulls and\r\nbones. I remember that I filled my collecting bag with seventy-five\r\npounds of skulls, from less than an inch to over eight inches in length,\r\nand all new to me and to science. This load I started to carry down the\r\nsteep trail to camp, a mile away. The good-natured Galyean, when he saw\r\nme tottering under the load, offered to relieve me of my burden, but I\r\nanswered with such vehemence that no one should touch it, that I would\r\nbreak my back first, that it was more precious than its weight in gold,\r\nthat he gave it up and fled down the mountains to camp, so that he might\r\nat least have a warm meal waiting for me when I arrived.\r\n\r\nHow can any man who has not had the experience himself, realize the\r\nglory of my triumphal march down that rugged trail? Not Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nwhen his chariot headed the army that was carrying away the treasures of\r\nthe Lord’s house from Jerusalem, with the king of Judah, blinded and\r\nbound in shackles of brass, in his train, could have known a prouder joy\r\nthan I did now over this discovery of a new region, in the very heart of\r\nthe old, which promised so rich a harvest of rare fossil remains. This\r\nis an instance of an experience which has been very common in my\r\nlife—when I have been most completely hopeless and discouraged, I have\r\nmade my greatest discoveries.\r\n\r\nOf the remarkable batrachians and lizards which twelve million years ago\r\npeopled the estuaries and bayous of the Permian ocean shores, I found,\r\nduring that three months’ expedition, forty-five complete or nearly\r\ncomplete skulls, many of them with more or less perfect parts of the\r\nskeletons attached, and forty-seven fragmentary skulls, ranging in size\r\nfrom less than half an inch to two feet in length; the whole collection\r\ncontaining one hundred and eighty-three specimens of the extinct life of\r\nthe Texan Permian. The American Museum, which secured this splendid\r\nmaterial, was unable to describe and publish it then, while the results\r\nof my famous expedition to these beds in 1901 for the Royal Museum of\r\nMunich were at once described by Dr. Broili. Consequently the American\r\nMuseum lost much of the glory which attaches to the description of new\r\nmaterial. However, the Permian collection in the American Museum is now\r\nbeing worked out with results of great importance to science.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by my success on this expedition, I set out with high hopes\r\non January twentieth of the following year to continue my work for\r\nProfessor Cope in these beds. On reaching my headquarters at Seymour, I\r\nsucceeded in hiring an old man with a team and wagon, and on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of January, I made my first camp on Bushy Creek, ten miles\r\nnorth of Seymour.\r\n\r\nThree days later I found what I believed promised to be a fine specimen\r\nof the ladder-spined reptile, _Naosaurus_, called fin-backed by Cope. A\r\nnumber of perfect spines were exposed, presenting the possibility of\r\nsecuring a complete specimen. I worked very carefully over this\r\nskeleton, hoping to take it out whole and in good shape. It lay in red\r\nand white sandstone, which easily disintegrated on the surface into\r\nshale-like flakes. The spines and transverse projections, which\r\nterminate in rounded knobs, were all broken _in situ_, and were also\r\nflexed and tilted with the strata, so that great care was necessary in\r\nfollowing them. They were about three inches apart. I numbered the\r\nspines 1, 2, 3, etc., not with reference to their natural position, but\r\nto the order in which I came to them. A good many of the rounded ends of\r\nthe lateral spines were missing, having been washed down the slope. I\r\nhoped to find them later.\r\n\r\nAs I studied these remarkable spines, many of them, near the center of\r\nthe body, three feet high, with the lateral spines alternating or\r\nopposite, I instinctively called the creature the ladder-spined reptile;\r\nand I cannot see how Professor Cope could have imagined that these\r\nspines had any resemblance to the mast and yard-arms of a vessel, and\r\nthat there was a thin membrane stretched between them which caught the\r\nbreeze and acted as a sail. Later discoveries show it to be a land\r\nanimal. Professor Osborn’s magnificent restoration of the _Naosaurus_ is\r\nshown. (Fig. 33.)\r\n\r\nAs I have said, it was a long and trying task to take up the skeleton,\r\nas it was in thousands of fragments. If I had dug them up as one would\r\ndig potatoes, no one would ever have had the patience to put them\r\ntogether again. So I took up each spine in sections, wrapping say fifty\r\nfragments together, and numbering them No. 1, spine 1, package 1, etc.;\r\nso that when the whole collection came to be put together, the sections\r\ncould be mended separately first and then joined to one another.\r\n\r\nThe broken condition in which I found the skeleton prevented me from\r\nrealizing then how complete and valuable it was; but as I look now at\r\nthe fine photograph of the mounted specimen,—the only mounted specimen\r\nof the _Naosaurus_ in the world (Fig. 32), I can see that this\r\nexpedition was indeed a success, in spite of the discouragement which I\r\nwent through at the time.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the _Naosaurus_, I was obliged to spend weeks of\r\nwork without results, growing more and more disheartened because I\r\nmyself was fully persuaded that the search was useless. Professor Cope\r\nwas convinced that there was a fossil-bearing stratum between the\r\nPermian and Triassic, which would yield an entirely new fauna, and he\r\nhad reasoned out that this ideal bed must be located northwest of the\r\nproductive bed already known, in the very region, in fact, which I had\r\ngone over with such care for the Museum of Comparative Zoology of\r\nHarvard in 1882, and found barren. I, therefore, protested as strongly\r\nas I could against making the trip; but he insisted, and his more\r\npowerful will won the day. So I was forced to spend a month of extremely\r\ntrying labor at the head of Crooked Creek and in the other creek\r\nvalleys, northwest of the productive beds.\r\n\r\nHere were thousands of acres of denuded bluffs of red clay, cut into\r\nfantastic shapes, often resembling old fashioned straw bee-hives or\r\ncrumbling towers and battlements. As far as the eye could reach, they\r\nspread out along the divide in ever-varying shapes. The beds\r\ndisintegrated easily into red mud. There were no concretions, although\r\nthe rock was full of concentric rings, from the sixteenth of an inch to\r\nan inch in diameter, consisting of a round white spot with a red rim.\r\nThe narrow dikes which cross the thick deposits of clay are filled with\r\nfibrous gypsum. Underneath the clay lie strata of red and white\r\nsandstone and compact concretionary rock, all barren.\r\n\r\nBut the discouragement which attended my unsuccessful search was only\r\none of the trials with which I had to contend that winter. In the first\r\nplace, the weather was against me. It snowed or rained continually, so\r\nthat the ground was never dry, and I took up ten or fifteen pounds of\r\nred mud on each foot as I walked. I came down with a severe attack of\r\ngrippe, too; and to make matters worse, my teamster, who was also my\r\ncook, took a particular dislike to my stove, which had been manufactured\r\nunder my own supervision and had always proved satisfactory with other\r\nmen, and insisted upon doing all his cooking in a trench outside the\r\ntent, so that I lost the heat which I might have had but for his\r\nobstinacy.\r\n\r\nEvery morning I climbed out of bed with aching bones, and started on my\r\nlong tramp. At first I would hardly be able to drag myself along, but\r\ngradually, as I warmed to the work, I would move faster, until usually I\r\ngot so far away from camp that I should not have been able to return for\r\ndinner without taking more time than I could afford, and so went without\r\nthat meal. After working as long as I could see, I would return to my\r\nuncomfortable camp, to go through the same performance on the following\r\nday. I had suffered from fever and ague in the fossil fields of Kansas,\r\nand had supposed that it would be impossible to suffer more, but I found\r\nthe grippe even more relentless than the ague.\r\n\r\nTo add to my worries, the people at my post office had taken in a family\r\nwith a malignant form of sore eyes, and although I supplied them with\r\ncuratives, they would get careless. The peevish old man whom I had\r\nemployed gave me a great deal of trouble too, at one time threatening to\r\nleave me alone in the brakes. In general, my experiences with hired men\r\nhave taught me the advisability of owning my own outfit, whenever it is\r\npossible. A hired man knows how helpless one is in the fossil fields\r\nwithout transportation, and takes advantage of the power which that\r\nhelplessness gives him; or he looks at things from the hired man’s point\r\nof view, and if he can better his wages by leaving his employer, thinks\r\nthat he has a perfect right to do so, even if he has made a contract to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter working for weeks in accordance with Cope’s instructions, although\r\nit was as useless as carrying bricks from one side of a yard to the\r\nother and back again, I returned, worn and discouraged, to the beds\r\nwhich produced at least a few fossils. I determined, moreover, to give\r\nup the field at the end of my contract, and go home, and wrote a\r\ndespondent letter to Cope, asking to be relieved when the contract\r\nexpired, as I needed rest. It was then that I received the letter which\r\nI publish here in facsimile, a letter which I shall always cherish, not\r\nonly because it shows the very best side of Cope’s character, but\r\nbecause it makes me feel that he realized that my life work could not be\r\nmeasured by money. It gave me at the time the kind of encouragement\r\nwhich I needed more than any other, and on receipt of it, although I was\r\njust ready to give up from exhaustion and homesickness, I decided to\r\nremain another month in those barren fields. Cope promised that he would\r\nnever again send me into a field against my own judgment; and by having\r\nmy own way again, I was so fortunate as to add many new specimens to the\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nFor I was rewarded, as I have always in my life been rewarded, for my\r\nmany days of fruitless toil, by the discovery of a long stretch of beds\r\nwhose brilliant metallic color, the result of a large amount of iron\r\naccumulated by a dank and luxurious vegetation, testified that they had\r\nonce formed the mud at the bottom of a bayou. This old swamp proved to\r\nhave been the habitat of countless salamanders, and thanks to this\r\ndiscovery I accomplished more during the last month of my stay in Texas\r\nthan during all the rest of the time put together, leaving out of\r\naccount, of course, the fin-backed lizard.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in showing my readers a splendid skull (Fig. 34) after\r\nBroili, both the palatine and superior exposures of one peculiar species\r\nof these salamanders, to which Cope gave the name _Diplocaulus\r\nmagnicornis_. The eyes are far down on the face, but with a broad\r\nexpanse of sculptured bone behind, terminating in two long “horns,”\r\nfourteen inches across from tip to tip, which are merely the greatly\r\nprolonged corners of the back of the skull. There are three rows of\r\nminute teeth in the roof of the mouth, and a couple of occipital\r\ncondyles. The vertebræ have a double row of spines down each side of the\r\nmedian line, and the body is long and slender with weak limbs. The head\r\nwas the largest part of the creature. This species was the most common\r\nof all those which I discovered in the Permian beds. Professor Cope used\r\nto call the specimens “mud heads,” as they were almost always covered\r\nwith a thin coating of silicified mud, which was very difficult to\r\nremove. In fact, nearly all the bones in this region were enclosed in a\r\nhard red matrix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—FOSSIL SKULL OF GIANT SALAMANDER, _Diplocaulus magnicornis_.\r\n\r\n  Collected by Charles Sternberg in 1901. (After Broili.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—PROFESSOR HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1897, I was again working in the Texas Permian for\r\nProfessor Cope. He was deeply interested in the ancient fauna of the\r\nregion, and I was sending him all the finer specimens by express, as I\r\nhad during the last two years. On the fifteenth of April, I was camping\r\non Indian Creek, having just completed a long and trying journey of\r\nabout a hundred miles, around the Little Wichita and back to the main\r\nriver at Indian Creek. During the trip we had encountered a terrible\r\nwindstorm, which had threatened to carry away our tent, but we had\r\nweathered the gale and camped in the timber. I had gone to bed, but was\r\nroused from my cot by the arrival of a livery-man, who had been hunting\r\nfor me all the day before. He handed me a message from Mrs. Cope,\r\nannouncing the death of her husband on the twelfth of April.\r\n\r\nI had lost friends before, and had known what it was to bury my own\r\ndead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I\r\ndid now over the news that in the very prime of life, in the noonday of\r\nhis glorious intellectual achievements, as he was bending all his\r\nenergies to the study and description of the wonderful fauna of the\r\nTexas Permian, the greatest naturalist in America had passed away with\r\nhis work undone. Death is terrible always, but it seems especially so\r\nwhen it strikes down men in the highest rank of intelligence, who are\r\nadding every day to the world’s knowledge.\r\n\r\nI was Cope’s assistant in the field for eight seasons, and while we did\r\nnot always agree, I consider the work which I did for him my most\r\nvaluable service to science. It has often been my good fortune to supply\r\nhim with some important link in the line of descent of vertebrate\r\nlife,—such as, for instance, the famous batrachian genera _Dissorophus_\r\nand _Otocœlus_, reptiles with a carapace, indicating the line of descent\r\nof turtles from batrachians, or the camel from the John Day beds, with\r\nthe metacarpals and metatarsals distinct,—and to furnish him with a\r\nlarge number of other forms which, with the material secured by his\r\nother collectors, helped him to acquire what Dr. Osborn has so\r\ntruthfully called “a masterly knowledge of each type.”\r\n\r\nIt is largely due to his efforts that the great science of paleontology,\r\nwhich, within my remembrance, had but few votaries, is now considered\r\none of the most interesting studies of modern times. Well did he\r\nprophesy, “After us there will be more demand for our wares”; how well\r\none can fully realize only when one remembers that the great American\r\nMuseum (whose department of paleontology under the able management of\r\nDr. Henry F. Osborn (Fig. 35) is now one of the glories of science),\r\nthat the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburg and the Field Columbian in Chicago\r\nand the Museums of Yale and Harvard and Princeton, besides many others\r\nboth here and in Europe have been largely built up since he wrote those\r\nwords. One thing is certain—as long as science lasts, and men love to\r\nstudy the animals of the present and of the past, Cope’s name and work\r\nwill be remembered and revered.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to show a good photograph of this lamented\r\nnaturalist (Fig. 15). Peace be to his ashes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n     IN THE RED BEDS OF TEXAS FOR THE ROYAL MUSEUM OF MUNICH, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\nWarned by my experiences in the red beds of Texas without a team of my\r\nown, when I made a contract to conduct an expedition there under the\r\ndirection of Dr. von Zittel of the Paleontological Museum of Munich, I\r\nresolved to ship my own horses and outfit to the field. I gave them into\r\nthe charge of my son George, who was rapidly becoming a most valuable\r\nassistant, and saw him put them aboard a freight car and get in himself.\r\nThe next time I saw him was at Rush Springs in the Indian Territory, on\r\ntop of a freight car, skilled in all the lore of a brakeman.\r\n\r\nWe reached the old camp at Willow Springs on the thirtieth of June,\r\n1901. The heat had already set in, promising the hottest season that I\r\nhad ever experienced in the valley of the Big Wichita. It grew more and\r\nmore intense as the months passed, the mercury often rising to 113 in\r\nthe shade. All the water dried up in both the natural and the artificial\r\ntanks, and the short buffalo grass in the pastures curled up and blew\r\naway. We were camped in Wagoner’s great pasture, twenty-five miles wide\r\nby fifty long, and I saw cattle die of thirst and starvation. Some had\r\nbecome so hungry that they had eaten the prickly pear, spines and all,\r\nand their mouths were full of putrefying sores where the spines had\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nThe ground was hot, and the air like the breath of a furnace; and we had\r\nto haul all the water we used in camp from six to twenty miles. To add\r\nto our troubles, one of our horses, Baby, almost cut off her foot in a\r\nwire fence while striking at the flies, which, during the day, never\r\nceased to torture man and beast. Even at night the horned cattle were\r\nnot free from them, for they clustered around the base of the horns,\r\nfifteen or twenty deep, like hives of swarming bees, for rest.\r\n\r\nThe country was indeed a desert and deserted. All the people who had\r\nsettled this valley on Coffee Creek or other streams, had gone never to\r\nreturn; the cowman had bought up all the homesteads. The schoolhouse in\r\nwhich I had so often attended worship had been moved from its\r\nfoundations, and the houses that had once echoed to the merry cries of\r\nchildren, stood empty and desolate.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe the hot winds, carrying on their wings clouds of\r\ndust, which were so common that year and the next? I once went to Godwin\r\nCreek, south of Seymour, passing on the way a hundred-acre field of\r\ncorn. It belonged to an old man, who had cultivated it until it was\r\nperfectly clean, and the long rows of living green were beautiful to\r\nsee. When I passed it again on my way back, a hot wind was blowing, so\r\nhot that I had to shield my face and eyes to keep them from burning. The\r\nbeautiful field, upon which the old man had looked with so many hopes of\r\na rich harvest, had been scorched and seared as if by a blast of fire.\r\n\r\nSo the weeks lengthened into months, and the merciless sky still refused\r\nus rain. At our camp on Coffee Creek the heat was so terrible that we\r\ncould not keep eggs, butter, or milk, or many other edibles necessary to\r\ncomfort and health. The result was that my stomach soon got out of\r\norder, and a severe attack of biliousness set in, attended by an\r\nincessant longing for a drink of cold, pure water. I thought by day and\r\ndreamed by night of the well on my farm at home, with the clear water\r\ndripping from the bucket; for our only drink, except coffee, was the\r\nwarm, foul-tasting water which had been brought in a barrel from twenty\r\nmiles away and had soon become stale. Even that was always giving out at\r\ninconvenient times. Whenever we came to a new fossil locality, and the\r\nhope was strong within me that now we would make a rich find, George was\r\nsure to say, “Papa, we’re out of water,” and we had to make the long\r\njourney through the awful heat over the dust-laden roads to the well at\r\nSeymour, twenty miles away. When we reached it at last, how we buried\r\nour faces in the bucket and the cool water!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  PALAEONTOLGISCHE\r\n      SAMMLUNG\r\n    DES STAATES\r\n\r\n   Alte Akademie.\r\n\r\n                                              München, den 23 December\r\n                                                                  190\r\n\r\n                       Charles Sternberg Esquire.\r\n                            Lawrence City Ka\r\n\r\n  My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  Before receiving your last letter of the 6th Decemb. I had sent to\r\n  your address a cheque of 200$ as Salary for the last month of your\r\n  collecting in Texas. I take notice of your freight expenses (3$ 46c)\r\n  and shall sent this little sum by an other occasion.\r\n\r\n  The 5 boxes with your great collection as well as the express box\r\n  with the little skulls have been safely arrived. I have looked over\r\n  the results of your researches and think that the collection of this\r\n  year is better than any other made before in Texas. With few\r\n  exceptions we have nearly all the genera created by Prof Cope and\r\n  several of these in much better condition. Beside theire is\r\n  certainly a good number of very interesting and new material which\r\n  will give us bussiness for several years.\r\n\r\n  I am very glad that I can give you such a satisfactory report about\r\n  your hard work in the interest of our museum and I hope to remain\r\n  further in friendly relations with yourself.\r\n\r\n  With the best wishes for the coming year and the kindest regards\r\n\r\n                                                      faithfully yours\r\n                                                          Dr. Zittel\r\n\r\nBut I will not dwell on this side of the picture, because there is\r\nanother side. We were finding in wonderful abundance the material which\r\nwe had come to secure, and the hardships were forgotten in the joy of\r\nsuccess. In spite of the many obstacles with which we had to contend, we\r\nsecured the collection described in that great letter from Dr. von\r\nZittel which I publish here in facsimile and which I prize more than any\r\nletter I ever received.\r\n\r\nBefore I accepted von Zittel’s offer that I should conduct an expedition\r\nfor him in the brakes of the Big Wichita, I wrote to him, telling him\r\nhow my work for science had had, from a material standpoint, no great\r\nreturns. My life, I said, had been a constant struggle to secure\r\nsufficient funds to carry on the work, and the men who had bought my\r\nmaterial had for the most part felt that they were doing good service to\r\ntheir museums by securing it at the lowest possible price, without\r\ntaking into consideration that even a fossil hunter has to live.\r\n\r\nIt was with pleasure indeed that I received the answer of this great\r\nGerman, whose works on paleontology are used as text-books in our\r\nuniversities. Dr. von Zittel wrote: “I am sorry that from your letter\r\nyou do not consider yourself in a position to work for the Munich Museum\r\nin Texas this spring. I can readily understand that after your long\r\nactivity in scientific fields without material results you are somewhat\r\ndiscouraged and embittered, and feel that your services in this\r\ndirection have not been sufficiently appreciated. For my part, I have\r\ndone my best to give you credit for the scientific side of your work,\r\nand your collections from Kansas and Texas in the Munich Museum will\r\nalways be an everlasting memorial to the name of Charles Sternberg.”\r\n\r\nSuch a letter, from a man like von Zittel, put new life and courage into\r\nmy veins, as a similar letter from Professor Cope had once before, and\r\nmade me feel that a little suffering more or less mattered nothing when\r\nmeasured with such enduring results. Cope is dead and von Zittel is\r\ndead, so far as such men can die, but I have preserved their letters as\r\nheirlooms for my children’s children; for they testify that “no matter\r\nwhat the common herd may say about me,” I have accomplished the object\r\nwhich I set before myself as a boy, and have done my humble part toward\r\nbuilding up the great science of paleontology. I shall perish, but my\r\nfossils will last as long as the museums that have secured them.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Texas Permian. I will follow my notebook for a\r\nwhile, as that, perhaps, is the best way to give my readers an idea of\r\nour life there.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of July 1 was in Seymour. I write: “A big dust storm\r\nstruck the town, and this evening a rain is falling. This is indeed a\r\ngreat relief to me, as it will make the air cooler and give me water in\r\nthe brakes, so that I can visit localities I could not before. My wagon,\r\nbrought from Kansas, is a narrow-gauge one, and all the roads in Texas\r\nare cut by broad-gauge wagons. This forces my team to pull with one set\r\nof wheels in the rut and the other outside. Consequently the labor is\r\nwearing them out, in connection with the awful heat. I am, therefore,\r\nhaving new axles made, a long and tedious work, and I am resting out of\r\nthe heat. Jesse S. Williamson has told me to occupy the building owned\r\nby himself and Will Minnich. It is a little cabin within a mile of the\r\nbone bed near Willow Springs. It has a tank of water for the horses, and\r\nis but a mile away from the schoolhouse, where a well has been dug. A\r\nfew bucketsful a day, enough for camp use, trickles into it.” This cabin\r\nproved to be a great accommodation, especially as the owners had a stack\r\nof sorghum, which was placed at my disposal and saved me the trouble of\r\nhauling out hay.\r\n\r\nAs one of my spindles was broken, I had to send to Lawrence for another,\r\nand it was not until the sixteenth that I got my wagon from the shop. I\r\nthen drove out to my old camp on Grey Creek in Mr. Craddock’s pasture.\r\nHere, too, was the center of a field from which I had reaped a rich\r\nharvest for Professor Cope.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth, my notebook states that I was in the field all day\r\nand found fragments of skeletons and skulls, all broken to pieces and\r\nmixed up together. I could not find the horizon from which these\r\nspecimens came. They were all piled together with concretions in a long,\r\nnarrow wash, while above there was a level denuded tract covered with\r\nconcretions. The only way in which I can account for the mixture of\r\nfragmentary specimens is that a bone bed lay above the level stretch,\r\nand in the disintegration of the deposit, the fragments were carried by\r\nfloods into the narrow gulch, until not a sign of the original bed was\r\nleft to mark its site.\r\n\r\nI had sent a large collection from this same locality to Professor Cope,\r\nand he had been much interested, but had also been extremely tantalized\r\nby the fact that there were great numbers of fragmentary skulls, and\r\nthat although the fragments looked freshly broken, none of the pieces\r\ncould be united to form a perfect skull. I now found the same trouble\r\nagain. Possibly some of the missing fragments of the skulls in Cope’s\r\ncollection, now in the American Museum, may be in the lot sent to\r\nMunich, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth, I found the nearly perfect skull of a new species,\r\nand on the twentieth, another very fine skull near the locality from\r\nwhich I had secured the many fragments a day or two before. It was a\r\nskull of the great salamander, _Eryops megacephalus_ Cope. There were\r\nsix pairs of large teeth in the roof of the mouth, and a single row of\r\nvarious sizes in the mandibles. Some of the points had been broken off\r\nand were lost. The skull is over twenty inches long. All the bones are\r\nbeautifully sculptured on the external surface. A few years before I had\r\nfound a nearly complete skeleton of this creature, some twelve feet in\r\nlength, lying at right angles to the Chisholm Trail. It was preserved in\r\nhard concretions, and had weathered out on the slope of a hill. The feet\r\nof countless cattle, just starting out on their weary journey for Kansas\r\nand the North, had worn away the solid siliceous envelope to the bones.\r\n\r\nHow the salamander tribe has degenerated since the days of these\r\npowerful creatures! Supplied with both gills and lungs, they dominated\r\nland and water, and increasing and multiplying in the tropical\r\natmosphere, filled the swamps and bayous of this region. To-day we pull\r\nfrom some well or spring a weak creature called a mud puppy, and it is\r\nhard to realize that its ancestors, twelve million years ago, were\r\nstrong and mighty, the monarchs of creation.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Craddock’s pasture; on July twentieth my notes read: “I\r\nam suffering from the heat, my tongue badly coated. However, I have got\r\nsome splendid material. If I succumb to the awful heat and die, my\r\ndiscoveries will have done much toward enriching the collection at\r\nMunich.”\r\n\r\nOn July twenty-first, I continue: “It is fearfully hot to-day, and I\r\ncannot work the beds without great suffering. I found a little skull.”\r\n\r\nThe hot weather continued, and I went out to the cabin on Coffee Creek.\r\nPet, our four-year-old, got away, and when George took her from a herd\r\nof horses, he found a big hole in her shoulder. “Both horses are failing\r\nfast,” my notes read. “Have to send George in for feed. It is hard on\r\nthe team to have to haul a load this weather through dust knee-deep,\r\nwith no water fit to drink.”\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth, I was left alone, and went a mile north to the bone\r\nbed and began to dig into the face of a hard greenish layer of\r\nclay-stone, near a place where I had found some fragments in former\r\nyears. I was delighted to find a pocket with two good skulls _in situ_,\r\nand the next day George returned with his load, and I had some fresh\r\nwater, which soon, however, grew lukewarm. We found two more skulls in\r\nthe pocket referred to, one of which was the _Labidosaurus hamatus_\r\nCope, one of the earliest of reptiles. Another was that of a new genus\r\nand species which I found later, when we went back to Grey Creek to get\r\na camp ready to receive Dr. Broili. He was to come directly from Munich\r\nto my camp in the red beds.\r\n\r\nOn the first of August, as we were out of provisions, we went into town.\r\nI rented a large room over a store building, and made tables and\r\nunpacked specimens for Dr. Broili’s inspection. While I was working\r\nthere, a storm of grasshoppers struck the building, beating against it\r\nlike hailstones; and the next morning the ground was covered with them.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth, we drove out to our old camp on Grey Creek, and pitched\r\ntwo tents with the fly stretched between. The walls were elevated, and\r\nwe were able to make a shade against the rays of the relentless sun. I\r\nwent a couple of miles north, over the table mountain above camp, and\r\nfound two extremely beautiful skulls of the long-horned amphibian,[2]\r\n_Diplocaulus magnicornis_ Cope, a strange animal of which I have already\r\nspoken. I found also a specimen of the gar-pike, that ancient fish which\r\nhas left its enameled scales in the rocks of many formations, whose\r\ndescendants are still living in our rivers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  See Fig. 34.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of August, in spite of the debilitating heat, I started on\r\na long trip to the head of Brushy Creek, on horseback. I climbed Table\r\nMountain, which was, perhaps, three hundred feet above the camp, and\r\nstruck west along the divide between the two creeks. I frequently left\r\nthe horse tied to a fence, while I plunged down into the gorges on\r\neither side. At last, about three miles northwest of camp, at the bend\r\nof a branch of Brushy Creek, I noticed a denuded tract of the kind of\r\nbed I have already described, to which an abundance of bog iron lent a\r\nmetallic luster; the very place to look for fossils.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I found was the perfect skull, six inches long, of a\r\nbatrachian (_Diplocaulus copei_ Broili); then, lying on the surface,\r\nanother beautiful skull (_Varanosaurus acutirostris_ Broili), with many\r\nof the bones of the skeleton, from which the hard red matrix had been\r\nwashed off clean. The upper and lower jaws were locked together, and the\r\nlong row of glistening teeth shone in the fierce light. The eyes were\r\nset far back, and the nose openings were near the front. It was so\r\ndifferent from anything I had ever seen before that I was sure it must\r\nbe new. Dr. Broili, in describing it, speaks of it as the most perfect\r\nspecimen ever found in these beds. Nearly all the other skulls I had\r\nsecured are compressed vertically, while this was compressed laterally.\r\n\r\nI found in this bed hundreds of fragments of rock filled with the\r\nglittering scales of fishes, as brilliant now as in the days when they\r\ncovered the bodies of these old fish. Here, also, I discovered a huge\r\nspecimen of the long-horned species (_Diplocaulus magnicornis?_), and\r\nothers much smaller, which proved to be the new _Diplocaulus copei_.\r\n“This,” my notes say, “promises to be one of the finest localities I\r\nhave found, and pays for the days of search under trying conditions.”\r\n\r\nWhen I reached camp, I found that George also had had a red-letter day,\r\nand had found a bone bed of minute animals on some brakes of Grey Creek\r\nunder the roots of the grass in a washout. He brought in a skull, the\r\nsmallest I had ever collected, with a great many broken bones and teeth.\r\nOne specimen, which Dr. Broili named in my honor _Cardicephalus\r\nsternbergi_, was not over half an inch long. I secured here six skulls\r\nof the new _Diplocaulus copei_, also.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the twelfth of August, Dr. Broili reached Seymour, and George\r\nand I met him at the station. A tall, strong, fine-looking German, with\r\na full beard, he impressed me very favorably. The great difficulty was\r\nthat, owing to my deaf ear, it was very hard for me to understand his\r\nbroken English, and unfortunately I could not speak a word of German. I\r\njudged that he had learned his English from an Englishman and not from\r\nan American, as he used a peculiar brogue with which I was not familiar.\r\nGeorge learned to understand him better, and they became the best of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWe went back to camp, where we had the pleasure of Dr. Broili’s company\r\nfor two weeks, during which I formed a friendship which I have always\r\ndeeply appreciated. He was delighted with my work and the material we\r\nhad secured, but, as he says in the introduction to his great work\r\ndescribing my material, he could not stand the heat.\r\n\r\nHe describes part of my material in his splendid work on the Permian\r\nStegocephala and reptiles, published in Stuttgart, with one hundred and\r\ntwenty pages of text and thirteen fine plates. He says on p. 1: “The\r\nexcellent results of the expedition of Mr. Sternberg in the spring of\r\n1901 to Texas, which brought many very valuable specimens of _Eryops_,\r\n_Dimetredon_, and _Labidosaurus_ to the Paleontological Museum’s\r\ncollection, caused the conservator of the Royal Paleontological\r\nCollection, Councillor von Zittel, to send out in the year of 1901 a\r\nsecond expedition to the Permian beds of the same territory, he being\r\nagain successful in securing Mr. Charles Sternberg, the excellent\r\ncollector from Lawrence, Kansas. Already in June of the same year he was\r\nin the midst of his sphere of activity in the Wichita Permian beds, near\r\nthe small town of Seymour, Baylor County, located on a branch of the\r\nFort Worth and Denver Railroad. On my arrival in the camp, through the\r\nassistance of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Science, it was made\r\npossible for me to take part in the collection from the beginning to the\r\nend of August. I found already a very good collection of very rich\r\nmaterials, which, besides parts of _Dimetredon_, _Labidosaurus_,\r\n_Pariotichus_, and other Theromorphs, included an excellent collection\r\nof different examples of _Diplocaulus_, of which some still possessed\r\nthe greater part of the vertebræ. During my stay in that territory, our\r\nwork principally consisted in making collections from our camp. We were\r\ncompelled, on account of scarcity of water from the great heat, to keep\r\nnear Seymour.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—DR. KARL VON ZITTEL.\r\n\r\n  Born September 25, 1839.

Sent for mounting to Tübingen\r\n    University.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI am a patriot, and it would have pleased me to see all these splendid\r\nexamples of ancient life enrich our home museums; but Germany is my\r\nfatherland, at least it was the fatherland of my fathers, and I am glad\r\nto have been able to build up there the best collection of Kansas and\r\nTexas forms in Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest prizes of the Munich Collection is a skeleton of\r\n_Labidosaurus_, now mounted there and collected by myself.\r\n_Labidosaurus_ is important because it belongs to a very ancient and\r\nprimitive group of reptiles, which, according to Prof. H. F. Osborn and\r\nother authorities, were the ancestors of all the later forms of\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Broili left to return to Munich, I continued my work, camping\r\non east Coffee Creek. Here again our search was rewarded. I found\r\nanother bone bed of very small lizards, some of them, I think, not over\r\nsix inches long. The skulls ranged in size from less than half an inch\r\nto an inch in length. Cope has given them the name _Lysorophus\r\ntricarinatus_. Drs. Broili and Case in their valuable papers have shown\r\nthat this _Lysorophus_ is one of the most interesting genera of all this\r\nwonderful fauna, since in the structure of the skull it is a veritable\r\n“missing link” between the batrachia and reptilia.\r\n\r\nThe deposit in which I found the _Lysorophus_ was large, containing\r\nthousands of bones and many fine skulls. I am convinced that these\r\ncreatures must have hibernated, as many of them were coiled in a circle\r\nin an envelope of hardened mud, and appear to have lain down never to\r\nwake again, each tiny reptile and its nest having been preserved through\r\nall the ages since. The flesh, of course, decayed soon after death, but\r\nby the process of petrification the bones have been replaced by stone.\r\n\r\nNow I have always wanted to explain to a popular audience what this\r\nprocess of petrification really is. The word petrification should be\r\ndropped from our vocabulary, because it signifies an impossibility. I\r\nremember, as a boy, translating from the Latin a sentence like this—“His\r\nbones became stone,” that is, turned to stone, and one often hears the\r\nexpression petrified wood as meaning wood which has turned to stone; as\r\nif there were a process in nature by which one substance could be turned\r\ninto another, as the philosopher’s stone would have changed iron to\r\ngold. As a matter of fact, the process denoted by the word petrification\r\nis a process of replacement, not of transmutation. After the death of\r\nthese ancient animals and the decay of their flesh, the water that\r\npassed through the bones carried from the cells of which they were made\r\nup the organic contents which decay, and left in their place deposits of\r\nthe silica or lime which it held in solution. The same process continued\r\nwhen the lagoon bed was elevated above the water as solid rock. The\r\nrain-water, seeping down through rock and fossil alike, left in the bone\r\ncells the mineral matter it was carrying, until they were filled with\r\nit. Then, in process of time, the cell walls are broken down and rebuilt\r\nwith silica or lime, and complete fossilization, or petrifaction as it\r\nis called, takes place, as in the case of the fossil bones in the Texas\r\nPermian. I found one specimen of the ladder-spined reptile in which the\r\nbones had been entirely replaced by iron ore, and others made up of\r\nsilica.\r\n\r\nHow long does it take for the mineral matter to replace entirely the\r\noriginal bones? Ages upon ages. I found on the plains of Kansas a quarry\r\nof elephant bones, from which I took over two hundred teeth of the\r\nColumbian mammoth, some of the larger ones weighing fourteen pounds\r\neach. The broken bones were scattered by the ton through the matrix. I\r\nhad them analyzed by Dr. Bailey, the head of the chemical department of\r\nKansas State University, and he found only ten per cent. of silicified\r\nmatter in them; that is, they were only ten per cent. less rich in\r\nphosphate of lime than Armour’s ground bone meal. This great elephant\r\nlived about the time of the Ohio mastodon, whose bones have been found\r\nin such a position as to indicate that they were buried when Niagara\r\nFalls were six miles below their present site. So if we knew how long it\r\nhas taken the river to dig six miles of its big ditch, we could tell how\r\nlong it has taken to impregnate the bones of the mammoths in central\r\nKansas with ten per cent. of silica. How foolish, then, to speak of\r\ncompletely petrified men, when man had probably not made his appearance\r\nin America at the time of the mammoths.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Texas Permian, as I have already mentioned, are of red\r\nclay filled with concretions of every conceivable form. I remember once\r\nrounding a butte and seeing before me hundreds of cocoanuts, some whole\r\nand others with the brownish shells broken, showing the white meat\r\nwithin. Absent-mindedly, I sprang from my horse to feast upon them, to\r\nfind that they were concretions which had so closely imitated cocoanuts\r\nin shape and color that even I, an experienced collector, had been\r\nmomentarily deceived. I knew, too, of a man who exhibited a collection\r\nof large concretions as fossil Hubbard squashes, and I heard no one\r\ndoubting that they were all that their labels claimed.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct formations in the Permian of this part of Texas\r\nwhich give character to the surface of the country. They are as\r\ndifferent as if separated by hundreds of miles. I visited one locality\r\non Pony Creek, where the red beds lay on top of the gray beds\r\nconformably. Looking to the west, a vast panorama, desolate and forlorn,\r\nof crumbling and denuded bluffs, narrow valleys, and beetling crags,\r\nspread out before me, with the usual red color dominant everywhere, its\r\nmonotony relieved only here and there by the green of some stunted\r\nmesquite or patch of grass. To the east stretched the narrow valley of\r\nPony Creek, whose topography is the same as that which is so familiar to\r\nthe residents of eastern Kansas—a ledge of gray sandstone forming a\r\nnarrow escarpment on either side and following the trend of the hills\r\naround the ravines, with grass coming down in gentle swells to meet it\r\nor rising to it from the bottom lands below. The greatest thickness of\r\nthis sandstone, as I observed it, was at the head of a narrow gulch near\r\nmy camp in the creek bottom, eight miles north of Seymour. I made a\r\nsection there and sent samples of the rock to Munich.\r\n\r\nI observed this rock under peculiar circumstances, and found that it\r\nsolved an interesting problem—that of the water supply of the red beds.\r\nI discovered why the water that falls where these beds only are exposed\r\nruns off soon after a shower, except when caught in natural or\r\nartificial tanks, so that there are no wells or springs in the red beds,\r\nwhile in the gray beds there are always springs and streams of running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn the September of my 1901 expedition, the heaviest rain since May fell\r\nin torrents for an hour and a half; water lay everywhere on the surface\r\nof the ground. But soon after the rain stopped, it had all disappeared.\r\nMy son had discovered across the creek a locality which was rich in\r\nfossil invertebrates, consisting chiefly of straight and coiled\r\nnautilus-like shells; and shortly after the downpour I went over to set\r\nto work collecting them, as Dr. Broili had told me that the Munich\r\nMuseum was anxious to secure such a collection. I had not been long at\r\nwork before George shouted to me that if I did not want to swim I would\r\nbetter cross the creek again at once. I followed his advice so hastily\r\nthat I left my tools behind. Instantly, a raging, boiling flood of water\r\ncovered the rocks in the bed of the creek, over which I had just crossed\r\ndry-shod, and rapidly rose to a height of eight feet, threatening to\r\nsubmerge my camp.\r\n\r\nLooking for a good place to work on my side of the creek, the west, I\r\nfound the gulch which I have referred to above. There was a level floor,\r\nformed by the first stratum of the gray beds, extending about five\r\nhundred yards to a ledge of red sandstone, eight feet thick. The floor\r\nwas covered with debris washed from the red beds. To my astonishment,\r\nalthough the surface was dry, a flood of water was rushing out from\r\nunder the upper deposits and tumbling in a miniature waterfall over the\r\ngray ledge, which was nearly five feet thick, into the ravine below.\r\n\r\nThe rock I found to be composed of four layers of sandstone. The upper\r\nlayer, eight inches thick, is composed of fine-grained sand, which seems\r\nto have been ground to an impalpable powder by the beating of the waves.\r\nIt is very compact and heavy, and upon exposure, breaks into rectangular\r\nblocks, so perfect in shape that they can be used for building purposes\r\nwithout being touched by hammer or chisel. The second layer breaks into\r\nlarge blocks of many tons’ weight. It is coarser grained than No. 1, and\r\nis about twenty inches thick. It contains a few casts of invertebrate\r\nfossils. No. 3 is twelve inches thick, and is of the same general\r\ncharacter as the other layers. It is literally packed with casts of\r\nstraight and coiled shells related to our living nautilus. They are\r\nmingled in great confusion. I believe some of the coiled shells are a\r\nfoot in diameter. This stratum is not so compact as the others, and\r\nseems to contain more lime. No. 4 is a very solid gray sandstone, eight\r\ninches thick, its upper surface crossed at various angles by elevated\r\nridges of harder material.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations, I am led to the conclusion that the pervious\r\nnature of the red beds, which in the valley of the Wichita are about\r\nthree hundred feet thick, allows the water to sink rapidly down through\r\nthem until it reaches the impenetrable gray sandstone; from which it\r\nruns off at whatever angle the rocks may be tilted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI may begin this closing chapter by mentioning some other specimens\r\nwhich I have discovered, or which my sons have, for, thank God, I have\r\nraised up a race of fossil hunters. My second son, Charles M. Sternberg,\r\nhas in his person recently fulfilled a dream of forty years of my own,\r\nby discovering the most complete skeleton known of Professor Marsh’s\r\ngreat toothed-bird, _Hesperornis regalis_, the Royal Bird of the West.\r\nUnfortunately the skull is missing, otherwise the nearly complete\r\nskeleton is present, and strange to say in normal position, showing that\r\nDr. F. A. Lucas is right in his restoration of the Martin specimen as\r\nmounted in the National Museum, i. e., as a loon, a diver instead of a\r\nwader, as had been supposed. Our specimen, however, shows a much longer\r\nneck than he had imagined. Strange indeed was this long-necked diver\r\nwith its tarsus at right angles with the body and its powerful\r\nweb-footed feet. The body was narrow, a little over four inches wide,\r\nwith a backbone like the keel of a boat. The head was ten inches long\r\nand armed with sharp teeth. By keeping the body horizontal it could\r\nexplore a column of water six feet high and wide, for any unfortunate\r\nfish within the zone of its activity. I would name this great loon the\r\nSnake-Bird of the Niobrara Group. This specimen I longed to find for so\r\nmany years, but was glad to give the credit to my son. It is to be\r\nmounted in the American Museum, and I picture it as it left my\r\nlaboratories (Fig. 41).\r\n\r\nA word also about that great flying machine of the Cretaceous, the\r\nflying lizard _Pteranodon_. The skeleton and a very fine skull, which my\r\nson found on Hackberry Creek in 1906, is now mounted in the British\r\nMuseum, where my warm friend Dr. A. Smith Woodward assures me “my\r\nspecimens are greatly admired.”\r\n\r\nEspecially have I been fortunate in the Kansas Chalk where my son,\r\nGeorge Fryer, has charge as I write these lines of my twentieth\r\nexpedition to those beds, and where he has discovered, and safely\r\ncollected and shipped to my laboratory, a great plate of the beautiful\r\nstemless Crinoid _Uintacrinus socialis_. I sent one section to Professor\r\nM. Boule, of the National Natural History Museum of France, at Paris.\r\nHundreds of these rare animals are represented in this slab (Fig. 42).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—SKELETON OF _Hesperornis regalis_, THE GIANT TOOTHED-BIRD OF\r\n    THE KANSAS CRETACEOUS.\r\n\r\n  Discovered by Charles M. Sternberg. In American Museum of Natural\r\n    History.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—SLAB OF FOSSIL CRINOIDS, _Unitacrinus socialis_, CONTAINING\r\n    160 CALYCES, COVERING FOUR BY SEVEN FEET.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore these pages go to press, and a year after I began work on them, I\r\nam pleased to be able to tell my readers of two noble specimens of the\r\nPleistocene Age I have just secured from the plains of Kansas, that\r\ngreat treasure house of the animals of the past. One is a majestic\r\nBison, whose head towering above that of his fellows supported a pair of\r\nhorn cores measuring six feet from tip to tip. Along the curve the\r\ndistance is eight feet. The length of the head is two feet, the distance\r\nbetween the horns sixteen inches, and from the center of the orbits, one\r\nfoot. These splendid horn cores were uncovered through a fortunate\r\nchance. It seems that the Missouri Pacific Railway, wishing to shorten\r\nthe creek in the vicinity of Hoxie, Sheridan County, Kansas, cut a new\r\nright-of-way for it across a bend. Their excavation came within two feet\r\nof the bones buried below, thirty-five feet from the surface of the\r\nearth; a friendly freshet washed them out, and they were discovered by\r\nMr. Frank Lee and Harley Henderson, of Hoxie, Kansas, June 15, 1902. I\r\nwas so fortunate as to secure them in June, 1908. I have filled them\r\nwith white shellac, and they are now in condition to be preserved\r\nalways, a specimen of the grand old bison of the Pleistocene time. Now\r\ntheir burial places are three thousand feet nearer the stars than the\r\nday they were buried there, as then the climate was semi-tropical and\r\nthe land they roamed over near sea level. The largest pair of horn cores\r\nof a similar bison are preserved in the Cincinnati Natural History\r\nMuseum. I copy from one of their records: “The most conspicuous figure\r\non Plate IX, with immense horn cores, is of the long extinct\r\nbroad-fronted bison. This specimen, by far the finest of its kind in\r\nexistence, is the greatest prize in the Cincinnati Museum. It was found\r\nin 1869 on Brush Creek, Brown County, Ohio, and through the efforts of\r\nDr. O. D. Norton it was acquired by the Museum in 1875.” It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to show my readers a photograph of the Kansas form that\r\nmeasures along the curve of the horn cores a foot and a half more than\r\nthe famous Ohio specimen. (Fig. 43.)\r\n\r\nThe great Columbian Elephant, whose jaw I illustrate and have still in\r\nmy possession, represents one of the largest, or the largest, of its\r\nkind ever discovered. It was found near the town of Ness City, in Ness\r\nCounty, Kansas. This giant lived at the same time the great Bison\r\nexisted. The last molars have pushed out the worn premolars and the\r\nother two molars, and occupy the entire jaw, having a grinding surface\r\nof 5 × 9 inches. The lower parts of the teeth flare out like a fan, and\r\nmeasure twenty inches along the top of the roots. The greatest\r\ncircumference of the jaws is 26½ inches, and the length 32 inches.\r\nUnfortunately, the articulations are worn away, likely by rolling in\r\nsome river bed. I secured this noble representative of American\r\nElephants in June, 1908 (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—SKULL AND HORNS OF GIANT BISON FROM HOXIE, KANSAS.\r\n\r\n  Spread of horn cores six feet, one inch; length along curve, eight\r\n    feet.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—JAW OF COLUMBIAN MAMMOTH, _Elephas columbi_.\r\n\r\n  Discovered in Ness County, Kansas.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHow rich are the strata that compose the earth’s crust only a fossil\r\nhunter can fully realize. Take, for instance, western Kansas, where the\r\nsoil beneath our feet is one vast cemetery. I know of a ravine in Logan\r\nCounty which cuts through four great formations. The lower levels, of\r\nreddish and blue chalk, are filled with the remains of swimming lizards,\r\nwith the wonderful Pteranodonts, the most perfect flying machines ever\r\nknown, with the toothed bird _Hesperornis_, the royal bird of the West,\r\nand the fish-bird _Ichthyornis_, with fish-like biconcave vertebræ, with\r\nfishes small and great (one form over sixteen feet long), and huge\r\nsea-tortoises. Above are the black shales of the Fort Pierre Cretaceous,\r\nthousands of feet of which are exposed in the bad lands of the upper\r\nMissouri. In this formation the dinosaurs reign supreme. Still higher\r\nare the mortar beds of the Loup Fork Tertiary, where the dominant type\r\nchanges from reptiles to mammals. Here, in western Kansas, are found\r\ngreat numbers of the short-limbed rhinoceros, the large land-turtle,\r\n_Testudo orthopygia_, several inferior tusked mastodons, the\r\nsaber-toothed tiger, the three-toed horse, and a deer only about\r\neighteen inches high. Higher still, where the grass roots shoot down to\r\nfeed on the bones, are the Columbian mammoth, the one-toed horse, like\r\nour species of to-day, a camel like our South American llama, and a\r\nbison far larger than the present species.\r\n\r\nThe living bison has become almost extinct itself, through the agency of\r\nman. And in the layer of soil which covers all these formations, an old\r\narrowhead and the crumbling bones of a modern buffalo give an object\r\nlesson in the manner in which these relics of the earlier world have\r\nbeen preserved. So races of animals, as of men, reach their highest\r\nstate of development, retrograde, and give place to other races, which,\r\nliving in the same regions, obey the same laws of progress.\r\n\r\nMy readers will be pleased, I am sure, to know that just before these\r\npages go to press I am permitted to tell the story of our last great\r\nhunt in Converse County, Wyoming, during July, August, and September,\r\n1908, for the largest skull of any known vertebrate, the great\r\nthree-horned dinosaur, _Triceratops_ (Fig. 45). Only thirteen good\r\nspecimens are known to American museums, 7 of which are in Yale\r\nUniversity Museum, and were collected, I believe, by J. B. Hatcher. From\r\nhis field notes Mr. Hatcher has made a map of this region with crosses\r\nto indicate the localities in which skulls have been found, and 30 are\r\nso indicated, but I soon learned that he noted broken and poor material,\r\nas well as the more perfect. With my three sons I entered the region\r\nwith enthusiasm on the hunt for one of these skulls for the British\r\nMuseum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—THREE-HORNED DINOSAUR, _Triceratops_ sp.\r\n\r\n  Restoration by Osborn and Knight. (From painting in American Museum of\r\n    Natural History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—DUCK-BILLED DINOSAUR, _Trachodon mirabilis_.\r\n\r\n  Restoration by Osborn and Knight. (From painting in American Museum of\r\n    Natural History.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nI was not employed by that institution, but the agreement was, in case I\r\nsecured a good specimen, it was to go to them. I must acknowledge I felt\r\nrather dubious when Dr. Osborn of the American Museum wrote me that he\r\nhad had parties in these beds four years, searching without success for\r\na specimen. For weeks and weeks we four examined every bit of exposed\r\nrock in vain. The rock consisted of clay and sandstone, the latter both\r\nmassive and cross-bedded. Scattered through the great deposits of\r\nsandstone were peculiar-shaped masses of very hard flinty rock, with the\r\nsame physical characteristics but with superior hardness. These added\r\nstrange forms to the land sculptury. Almost every form the mind can\r\nimagine is found here, from colonies of giant mushrooms, to human faces\r\nso startling as to secure instant attention from the observer. (Figs. 38\r\nand 39.)\r\n\r\nA general view of the country from an elevated butte shows many\r\ncone-like mounds, resembling table mountains or even haystacks in the\r\nhazy distance! As the rocks, and even the flint-like material, readily\r\ndisintegrate, the creeks that run east into the Cheyenne River soon\r\nradiate like the rays of a fan and deeply scar the narrow divides into\r\nrather deep canyons and narrow ravines. Perhaps a thousand feet of these\r\nfresh-water beds, are laid down in a basin surrounded, on all sides, by\r\nthe marine, Fort Pierre, and Fox Hills Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nBuck Creek on the south, Cheyenne River on north and east, and a line\r\nthrough the mouth of Lightning Creek would roughly give the area of the\r\nLaramie Beds we explored. They cover about a thousand square miles. Here\r\nin a country given up entirely to cattle and sheep ranges with but\r\nlittle of the country fenced, meeting no one but now and then a lonely\r\nsheep herder, my tribe of fossil hunters entered with bounding hope that\r\nwe might find some of these famous dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nHere is the border land between the Age of Reptiles and of Mammals,\r\nwhere mammals first appear as small marsupials. We secured several teeth\r\nof these early mammals. Day after day hoping against hope we struggled\r\nbravely on. Every night the boys gave answer to my anxious inquiry, What\r\nhave you found? Nothing. Often we ran out of palatable food, as we were\r\n65 miles from our base, and did not always realize how our appetites\r\nwould be sharpened by our miles of tramping over the rough hills and\r\nravines. One day in August, Levi and I started in our one-horse buggy to\r\na camp we had made near the cedar hills on Schneider Creek. As we passed\r\na small exposure which I had not gone over, I left him to drive and went\r\nover the beds of reddish shale, the remnant of an old peat-bog. I found\r\nthe end of a horn core of _Triceratops_, and further excavation showed I\r\nhad stumbled upon the burial place of one of these rare dinosaurs. How\r\nthankful we were that after so much useless labor we had at last secured\r\nthe great object of our hunt. It will prove a beautiful skull when\r\nprepared and mounted under the direction of Dr. Smith Woodward, Keeper\r\nof Geology in the British Museum, where so many of my discoveries have\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the skull was somewhat broken up, and one horn core is\r\nmissing. But one side of the face with the large horn core, the back of\r\nthe head, and the great posterior crest, seems entire, as well as large\r\npieces of the other side of the face, and a fine specimen will be made\r\nof it. The total length of the skull is 6 feet 6 inches. The horn core\r\nover the eye is 2 feet 4 inches high; while the circumference in the\r\nmiddle is 2 feet 8 inches, and it is 15 inches in diameter at the base.\r\n\r\nThis was a fully matured animal. As the bony ossicles of the head\r\narmature are co-ossified with the margin and remain as undulations more\r\nor less sharply defined, I am inclined to believe that they are\r\nornaments. They might assist a little in defense but not offense.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time my oldest son, George, told me of a region he had\r\nexplored a half-mile from our camp near the head of a ravine. Here we\r\nhad found a natural cistern full of rain-water, protected from the sun\r\nand cattle by a couple of great concretion-like masses of rock that\r\ncovered it. Over the divide where I had found the great skull, between\r\nBoggy and the breaks of Schneider near its mouth in Cheyenne River,\r\nGeorge took Levi and myself. The evening before, I took the skull in to\r\nLusk for shipment. George pointed out a locality in which he had found a\r\nbone-bed, where we later secured many teeth of reptiles and fishes,\r\nscales of ganoid fishes, bones of small dinosaurs and crocodiles and the\r\nbeautifully sculptured shells of turtles, Trionyx, etc. As there was\r\nstill a tract of a few hundred yards to be explored the two boys started\r\nto go over it, while I went to the bone-bed. They soon joined me with\r\nthe information that they had found some bones sticking out of a high\r\nescarpment of sandstone. George had found part of the specimen in one\r\nplace and Levi another part soon afterwards. I requested George to\r\ncarefully uncover the floor on which the bones lay.\r\n\r\nWhile we were taking in our skull, George and Levi ran nearly out of\r\nprovisions, and the last day of our absence lived on boiled potatoes.\r\nBut in spite of this they had removed a mass of sandstone 12 feet wide,\r\n15 feet deep, and 10 feet high.\r\n\r\nShall I ever experience such joy as when I stood in the quarry for the\r\nfirst time, and beheld lying in state the most complete skeleton of an\r\nextinct animal I have ever seen, after forty years of experience as a\r\ncollector! The crowning specimen of my life work!\r\n\r\nA great duck-billed dinosaur, a relative of _Trachodon mirabilis_, lay\r\non its back with front limbs stretched out as if imploring aid, while\r\nthe hind limbs in a convulsive effort were drawn up and folded against\r\nthe walls of the abdomen. The head lay under the right shoulder. One\r\ntheory might be that he had fallen on his back into a morass, and either\r\nbroken his neck or had been unable to withdraw his head from under his\r\nbody, and had choked to death or drowned. If this was so the antiseptic\r\ncharacter of the peat-bog had preserved the flesh until, through decay,\r\nthe contents of the viscera had been replaced with sand. It lay there\r\nwith expanded ribs as in life, wrapped in the impressions of the skin\r\nwhose beautiful patterns of octagonal plates marked the fine sandstone\r\nabove the bones. George had cut away the rock, leaving enough to give\r\nthe impression that even the flesh was replaced by sandstone, giving an\r\nexact picture of him, as he breathed his last some five million of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nA more probable explanation, judging from the shape of the skin outline\r\nwhich covers the abdomen and is sunken into the body cavity at least a\r\nfoot, is that the great creature died in the water. The gases forming in\r\nthe body floated the carcass, which was then carried by currents to the\r\nfinal burial place. When the gases escaped, the skin collapsed and\r\noccupied their place; the carcass sank head first and feet upward, the\r\nformer dragging under the shoulder as the body came to rest on the mud\r\nof the bottom.\r\n\r\nQuite different indeed is this grand example of extinct life from the\r\none restored and of which an ideal picture is given in this book (Fig.\r\n46). In the first place, in the specimen we discovered the ribs are\r\nexpanded, the great chest cavity measuring 18 inches deep, 24 inches\r\nlong, and 30 inches wide. I have no doubt but that with lungs expanded\r\nto their full capacity, he often swam across streams of water in the\r\ntropical jungle in which he lived and died. Further, the front limbs are\r\nnot mere arms, that never touched the ground, but were used in\r\nlocomotion, as there are toes with hoof-bones, not so large as those of\r\nthe hind feet but with the same pattern, and a divergent thumb, that had\r\na round bone for its ungual. Consequently the animal could use the front\r\nfeet as clumsy hands to hold down the limb of a tree from which he was\r\ncropping the tender foliage, or banners of moss. There were three\r\npowerful hoofs on each hind foot.\r\n\r\nI do not question, in the presence of this individual, which is complete\r\nexcepting the hind feet, tail and left tibia and fibula, but that the\r\nreptile often stood erect, supporting his ponderous weight while feeding\r\non the leaves of the forest. But when it walked it used its front limbs\r\nas well. A remarkable character are the countless rods of solid bone\r\nthat lay along the backbone in the flesh, and appear like ossified\r\ntendons similar to those in the leg of a turkey. Hundreds of ossified\r\nrods appeared, row after row, shaped like Indian beads, as thick as a\r\nlead pencil in the center and beveled off to a small round point. It has\r\noccurred to me that these were for defense; that when a great\r\n_Tyrannosaurus rex_ leaped on his back, his powerful claws found no\r\nlodgment in the flesh on account of these bony rods that could not be\r\npenetrated. Thus our dinosaur would shake off his enemy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow wonderful are the works of an Almighty hand! The life that now is,\r\nhow small a fraction of the life that has been! Miles of strata,\r\nmountain high, are but the stony sepulchers of the life of the past.\r\n\r\nHow rapidly has the field expanded which I entered as a pioneer some\r\nforty years ago! In 1867 I knew only five paleontologists—Agassiz,\r\nLesquereux, Marsh, Cope, and Leidy, with but few followers; while\r\nto-day, Harvard, Princeton, the American, the Carnegie, the Field, and\r\nthe National Museums have all built up great collections of the animals\r\nand plants of the past, and the number of publications on fossil animals\r\nhas reached an enormous total.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of attending the meeting of the American Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science that met in the American Museum in New\r\nYork at the mid-winter session in 1906. Professor Osborn introduced me\r\nto his splendid Head Preparator, Mr. Hermann, who has mounted the\r\nskeletons of the great _Brontosaurus_, _Allosaurus_, and so many other\r\nexamples of extinct animals. Mr. Hermann was requested by the Professor\r\nto devote all his spare time to showing me anything the exhibition and\r\nstorerooms contained, prepared or unprepared, and to do all in his power\r\nto make my visit pleasant. I certainly felt at home in that paradise of\r\nancient animals, many of which I had collected for science on my own\r\nexplorations. The magnificent halls in which they are exhibited are a\r\nwonderful tribute paid by the wealth and intelligence of the citizen of\r\nGreater New York to science. How admirable that Mr. Jesup should use his\r\nprivate fortune as the means to take from the obscurity of the private\r\ndwelling of the late Professor Cope his great collection, to which I was\r\na contributor for eight years; and he has placed it under Professor\r\nHenry F. Osborn, who with the assistance of Drs. J. L. Wortman, W. D.\r\nMatthew, and others, has brought order out of chaos and presented in\r\nintelligible shape not only that collection but many others from the\r\nfossil fields of the West.\r\n\r\nIt is a glorious thought to me that I have lived to see my wildest\r\ndreams come true, that I have seen stately halls rise to be graced with\r\nmany of the animals of the past that lived in countless thousands, and\r\nthat I have had the pleasure of securing some of the treasures, in the\r\nshape of complete skeletons, which now adorn those halls.\r\n\r\nI stood on Columbia Heights that same year of 1906, and my heart swelled\r\nwith pride when I looked down on that teeming metropolis and remembered\r\nthat I too was a native of the Empire State. Then I thought of my\r\ndistant prairie state of Kansas, and gloried in the thought that the\r\nbest years of my life had been spent in her ancient ocean and lake beds,\r\nthose old cemeteries of creation.\r\n\r\nThat past life, at least a very small fraction of it, I have sought to\r\nbring before my readers with pen pictures. We have men among us who can\r\nput their conceptions of the ancient inhabitants of land and sea and air\r\non canvas, and among them are Mr. Charles R. Knight, of the American\r\nMuseum, and Mr. Sidney Prentice, of the Carnegie Museum. Mr. Prentice I\r\nknew as a boy, and he has done me the honor to assure me that my words\r\nof counsel have done something at least toward assisting him to make the\r\nchoice of following the work not only of an artist in a paleontological\r\nmuseum, but in portraying with pencil and brush the ideal pictures of\r\nthe early denizens of earth as in life. His success is shown in his\r\nrestorations of _Clidastes_. The results of Mr. Knight’s restorations of\r\nmany of the extinct animals brighten my pages, thanks to my friend\r\nProfessor Henry F. Osborn, so if I have failed in my pen pictures to\r\ntake my readers into the misty past, these brilliant restorations will\r\ncertainly have the desired effect.\r\n\r\nI cannot hope in this short space to have given more than a passing\r\nglance at the life of a fossil hunter. It has been one of joy to me; I\r\nshould not like to have missed making the discoveries I have made, and I\r\nwould willingly undergo the same hardships to accomplish the same\r\nresults. And if my story does anything to interest people in fossils, I\r\nshall feel that I have not written in vain.\r\n\r\nWhen I requested Professor William K. Gregory of Columbia University to\r\nbe the final reader of the manuscript of this book, “The Life of a\r\nFossil Hunter,” shall I ever forget his kind words? “I hope you will not\r\nfeel that you are under any personal obligations whatever, because this\r\nslight service is simply laid upon me by the necessities of the case, i.\r\ne., by the fact that your whole life and work have placed all\r\npaleontologists under lasting obligations to you.” Surely “my cup\r\nrunneth over; I have a goodly heritage.” Greater than their obligations\r\nto me, are mine to the men of science who have described, published,\r\nbut, above all, have prepared and exhibited the noble monuments of\r\ncreative genius which I have been so fortunate as to discover and make\r\nknown to the civilized world. My own body will crumble in dust, my soul\r\nreturn to God who gave it, but the works of His hands, those animals of\r\nother days, will give joy and pleasure “to generations yet unborn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n _Adocus_, 77\r\n\r\n Amphibian, Long-horned, 253\r\n\r\n Anderson, A.

It is the intention that in its own way, the\r\nnew series shall stand on a par with its famous predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of the new series is to answer questions which the\r\ncontemplation of Nature is constantly arousing in the mind of the\r\nunscientific intelligent person. But a collateral object will be to give\r\nsome intelligent notion of the “causes of things.”\r\n\r\nWhile the coöperation of foreign scholars will not be declined, the\r\nbooks will be under the guarantee of American experts, and generally\r\nfrom the American point of view; and where material crowds space,\r\npreference will be given to American facts over others of not more than\r\nequal interest.\r\n\r\nThe series will be in six divisions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I.
