Perhaps this was owing to the difficulties which had to be\r\nencountered from the thick undergrowth which in many places rendered it\r\nalmost impossible to penetrate sufficiently in order to make a _true_\r\nreport as regards the \"existence,\" \"location,\" and \"association\" of\r\nthese rocks.\r\n\r\nAdmirable reports have been written by R. E. Ellis, LL.D., Dr. Hunt, and\r\nothers, on the origin and distribution of the serpentines, and have been\r\nfully discussed and ventilated. Still, though various opinions have been\r\nexpressed upon the subject, they appear to differ in many respects. I\r\nmention these facts as possibly one inexperienced or unacquainted with\r\nthe country might consider it strange that a thorough examination of the\r\nAsbestos properties had not been followed. Yet the causes I have\r\nmentioned above, as well as the difficulties I had to contend with\r\nduring the months of heavy snowfall, lead me to believe that my\r\n_confreres_ (geologists) were disinclined to follow up a correct and\r\nactual prospectus of these valuable serpentinous localities.\r\n\r\nBefore locating, or going into details of these classes of rock as a\r\nmineral repository, I intend to treat on the subject as regards their\r\nmode of existence and origin.\r\n\r\nSerpentine is diffused under the head of \"metamorphic rocks,\" while, in\r\nthe widest sense, according to Studor and others, mineral metamorphism\r\nmeans every change of aggregation, structure, or chemical condition,\r\nwhich rocks have undergone subsequently to their deposition and\r\nstratification, or the effects which have been produced by forces other\r\nthan gravity and cohesion.\r\n\r\nThere fall under this definition the discolouration of the surface of,\r\nfor instance, black limestone, by the loss of its carbon, the formation\r\nof brownish red crusts in rocks of limestone, sandstone, many\r\nslatestones, shales, granite, &c., by the decomposition of compounds of\r\niron, finely disseminated in the mass of the rock, the change in rocks\r\nconsequent in the absorption of water, and the crumbling of many\r\ngranites and porphyries into gravel, occasioned by the decomposition of\r\nthe mica and felspar.\r\n\r\nIn its more limited sense the term \"metamorphic\" is confined to those\r\nchanges of rock which are produced directly or indirectly by agencies\r\nseated in the interior of the earth. In many cases the mode of change\r\nmay be explained by our physical or chemical theories, and may be viewed\r\nas the effects of temperature or of electro-chemical actions adjoining\r\nrocks or connecting communications with the interior of the earth, also\r\ndistinctly point out the seat from which this change proceeds. In many\r\nother cases the metamorphic process itself remains a mystery, and from\r\nthe nature of the products alone do we conclude that such a metamorphic\r\naction has taken place.\r\n\r\nSerpentine is generally believed to have been originally deposited as a\r\nsediment, and to have acquired its present compact crystalline character\r\nthrough the subsequent action of various chemical, or mechanical,\r\nagencies. It is known to be a _hydrated silicate of magnesia_ with about\r\nequal parts of silica and magnesia, and contains 12 per cent. of water\r\nwith varying proportions of iron, chromium manganese, alumina and lime,\r\nhas a specific gravity of 2.7, and weighs about 169 lbs. to the cubic\r\nfoot. It is found both in a soft and very compact state, of a waxy\r\nlustre, with many different shades of beautiful green which give it a\r\nmottled appearance like a serpent, hence the origin of its name\r\n\"serpentine,\" or ophite. It is called \"ranocchia\" by the Italians, from\r\nthe appearance it bears to the \"frog,\" and, on account of its\r\nsusceptibility to a high polish, is greatly valued as a marble for\r\ninterior ornamental purposes, more than exterior, as it weathers\r\nrapidly. In Galway, Ireland, it is found in large quantities, and called\r\n\"serpentinous marble,\" or \"ophi-calcite.\" It is also to be found in\r\nother parts of the world, as in the Pyrenees, Alps of Dauphing, Mount\r\nSt. Gothard, Italy, Sweden, Ural Mountains, Silesia, New South Wales,\r\nSavoy, Corsica, Cornwall, Scotland, and other places too numerous to\r\nmention; but in Canada the finest and most crystalline serpentine is to\r\nbe found forming great belts of over 100 miles long and several thousand\r\nfeet in breadth. There it associates with the dioretic, or volcanic,\r\nrocks, and is, according to Dr. Ells, without any doubt, \"An alteration\r\nproduct of a dioretic rock rich in olivine.\" It is sometimes very\r\ndifficult to distinguish the mineral constituents in many of the\r\nmetamorphic rocks, but diorite is always considered to be composed\r\nchiefly of felspar and hornblende, which composition enters largely into\r\nthe serpentines. Actinolite, tremolite, &c., and many other minerals,\r\nare sometimes found associating with it.\r\n\r\nThere are many valuable properties attributed to serpentine, and I am of\r\nopinion that the time is not far distant when it will be commercially\r\nconsidered an invaluable substance, and this on account of its\r\nrefractory properties. I may also mention that it can be extensively\r\nused in the manufacture of crucibles, &c. Its soft and unctuous\r\nqualities (especially where it is found associated with \"steatite,\" or\r\n\"soapstone,\" which is often to be seen in large quantities) renders it\r\neasy to be worked, and, if reduced to a powder, could be moulded in\r\nbricks which the most intense heat will not affect. One of the chief\r\nproperties it contains, and one which the serpentine of Lower Canada is\r\nso famous for, is the Asbestos, crysotile, or fibrous serpentine. This\r\nvaluable and important mineral product is found in paying quantities\r\nonly at certain points in the extensive serpentine reefs, and was first\r\nmined as an article of commerce in Canada in 1878, and has now become a\r\nregular and rapidly-developing industry.\r\n\r\nOn account of its incombustible and indestructible qualities, is\r\nextensively used in steam, hydraulic, and electrical machinery. It has\r\nbeen adopted by the Admiralty for engine packing, in Her Majesty's\r\nwar-ships. It is spun into six-fold yarn, with a tensile strength of 40\r\nlbs. and upwards, is manufactured into cloth, as clothing for firemen,\r\nand covering hose-pipes, in fire brigades, and also engine purposes, as\r\nwell as drop-curtains, and general stage scenery, and is employed by the\r\nprincipal railway and steamship companies, collieries, ironworks and all\r\nclasses of factories, and, in the manufacture of the new Asbestos grates\r\nand stoves, is finding for itself a large market. Messrs. Bell &\r\nCompany of London, who are the largest Asbestos users in the world,\r\nhave adopted it in the manufacture of over 50 special purposes in\r\nconnection with steam engines and general machinery, and, as a\r\nlubricant, Asbestoline ranks in the first degree.\r\n\r\nThere have been many mines started in Canada by people of the farming\r\nclass, as well as by companies, and \"cotton,\" as Asbestos is locally\r\ntermed, has been found in large quantities within a few feet from the\r\nsurface, in veins from 1/4 to 6 inches and more in length of fibre. In\r\nItaly, Asbestos is found, measuring up to 6 feet, in fibre, and\r\nchemically speaking, there is no difference between it and Canadian,\r\nexcept that the latter, though shorter in fibre, is much more compact\r\nand crystalline, and purer in every sense of the word than can be\r\nobtained in Italy, so much so, as I understand, that users of Italian\r\nmaterial have virtually abandoned it for Canadian. Although I have no\r\ndoubt but that Italian Asbestos has its own special purposes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth reached in Canada is 130 feet in open workings. No\r\ntimbering or extensive machinery is used in the manipulation of the\r\nmines, as the \"cuts\"--being usually in the mountain side--afford a\r\nnatural drainage, and dumpage.\r\n\r\nHaving blasted the rock, the first process of extraction is termed\r\n\"cobbing,\" which means breaking off the adhering serpentine from the\r\nAsbestos vein, this being manual work done by boys. The fibre is packed\r\nin sacks, each weighing 100 lbs., and in some cases 200 lbs. are shipped\r\nby the local railroad company to Montreal or New York at something about\r\n10 cents and 20 cents per sack.\r\n\r\nAsbestos is sorted into three qualities, and priced thus:--\r\n\r\n    1st quality, selling at mine $80 to $200, per ton of 2,000 lbs.\r\n    2nd    \"        \"       \"     60  \"   70,      \"        \"   \"\r\n    3rd    \"        \"       \"     25  \"   50,      \"        \"   \"\r\n\r\nSome inferior quality, at a very low price, is used by the Asbestos\r\nMining and Manufacturing Company of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe workmen are principally French Canadians belonging to the\r\nneighbouring villages, and the wages paid them are--\r\n\r\n    Miners (without board), $0.90 (3/9) to $1.25 (5/2), per day.\r\n    Pickers and cobbers,    $0.40 (1/8)  \" $0.70 (2/11),   \"\r\n\r\nThe cost of extraction is taken from $20 to $25 per ton; this includes\r\nlocal administrations and all other expenses connected with the mine,\r\nand with the adoption of machinery and the use of air-compressed drills\r\nthe cost of actual mining will be reduced to at least 30 per cent.; so\r\ntaking an average price of about $70 per ton, a net profit of from 8\r\npound to 9 pound, or 45 pound, is obtainable per ton of raw material.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the total amount of Asbestos, taken from all the mines, may be\r\nestimated at 1,500 tons, and of the amount returned last year (1888),\r\nall but 400 tons were from the Quebec province mines, and of these\r\nThetford turned out 2,560 tons, and Black Lake 950, or together\r\nthree-fourths of the whole out-put. The 400 tons were from Bridgewater,\r\nin the province of Ontario, a somewhat different class of mineral,\r\nwhich is generally used in the manufacture of fire-proof roofing.\r\n\r\nAs regards the indications of Asbestos, it is a general recognised fact,\r\nand one that may be depended on, that not alone in Canada, but indeed\r\nall other places where Asbestos-bearing serpentine is found, the\r\nexistence of Asbestos, or \"Amianthus,\" is noticed when the serpentine is\r\nexposed, and presents a rusted, sometimes greyish and broken appearance,\r\ndue to decomposition or weathering, or covered with a thin layer of\r\nsoil. Small veins of Asbestos are to be seen forming a network on the\r\nsurface of the rock. If closely examined there may be noticed the\r\nindications of a fault which, in the eastern townships of Quebec, has\r\ngenerally a direction of N. 40 degrees E., this fault appearing in all\r\nopenings where a good show of mineral is to be seen, presenting a wall\r\neither in a vertical position or at an angle, which is preferred to be\r\nnot greater than 30 degrees. From this wall, at a varying distance of\r\nfrom 5 to 20 feet, will be found another, sometimes parallel to, or at\r\nan opposite angle; in this latter case, if these walls be worked down,\r\nthey will be found to either meet, forming a trough-like appearance, or\r\nto change their course in a downward direction, leaving only a few feet\r\nfrom each other at the narrowest point, and then diverge to an unlimited\r\ndepth. In this case their faces will have a slicken appearance, smeared\r\nover with thin layers of imperfect Asbestos, or crysotile, now and then\r\ncompact, fibrous hornblende, up to 24 inches in length, of various\r\ncolours, and rich deposits of olivine, in rare cases small quantities of\r\n\"ground ivory\" with many other admixtures.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the serpentine within these walls is greatly distorted,\r\ncontaining many small veins of Asbestos varying from mere threads to 2\r\nand 3 inches in thickness, and sometimes deposits of grains of magnetic\r\niron or magnetite with traces of chromic iron, which in some localities\r\nbreak the continuity of the fibre, veins of rich white crystalline\r\nmatter (perhaps calcareous) with large deposits of \"soapstone,\" or\r\nsteatite, associated with \"serpentite.\" Such contorted out-crops are\r\nindications of rich veins of Asbestos, which will be found to both\r\nincrease in quantity and quality the deeper they are worked. And in the\r\ncase where the walls are parallel and the filling matter in the same\r\ncontorted condition, it is inevitable, in order to obtain a good fibre,\r\nconsiderable depth should be reached.\r\n\r\nThe serpentine, which constitute these walls, will also be found to\r\nproportionally become more compact, and less associated with impurities,\r\nand contain the finest quality and lustre of fibre.\r\n\r\nA very interesting phenomenon may be noticed at some of the mines in\r\nconnection with this contorted matter. It is the transposition of the\r\nserpentine into Asbestos fibre, by the action of the atmosphere. This is\r\nto be seen on the dumps where the filling matter and cobbed rock is\r\nexposed. In one or two cases I have seen large quantities of broken rock\r\nchanged into fibre after a few years, by atmospherical chemical\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nIn so many cases I find people are prejudiced from going deeper than a\r\nfew feet from the surface, as not finding a copious supply of Asbestos\r\nthere, when _good_ indications are shown they become disheartened.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from these practical facts it will be seen that in order to\r\nget the best results it is necessary to work at the lowest possible\r\nlevel when a favourable out-crop is shown, as, possibly, working at a\r\nhigh elevation on the out-crop may be a mistake, where a lower point is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThere are good indications of Asbestos where the serpentine is crossed\r\nby quartzose, gneiss, or \"traverse dykes,\" and some valuable finds have\r\nbeen made at the junction with the dioretic rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen the serpentine is found dark in colour, to have a granular\r\nappearance, containing many dark grains of, perhaps, felspathic\r\ncrystals, the Asbestos will be of a dark, dull, translucent lustre, very\r\ncompact, and easily fluffed to a fine silken fibre. The admixtures of\r\nhard and soft serpentine, where not effected by a fault, may sometimes\r\nbe regarded as a doubtful indication of an immediate find, but if its\r\nhardness increases on descending, and colour becomes more uniform, from\r\na light emerald green with a whitish admixture, to a dark olive, and\r\ncontaining numerous small veins of fibre, the conclusions may be\r\nconsidered as favourable to rich deposits of Asbestos.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I may add that the foregoing remarks, as regards the\r\nindications of this valuable mineral, are based on my personal\r\ngeological experience, and the reliable information of the managers of\r\nthe various Asbestos mines in Canada, whose opinions have greatly aided\r\nme in my recent prospection, and I trust that this pamphlet will not\r\nalone be a benefit to them, but to the Asbestos industry, which I feel\r\nassured will be one of the most prominent in the province of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    LUCIUS J.
