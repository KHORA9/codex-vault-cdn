For, notwithstanding the rapid\r\nprogress it has made within the last thirty years, it is far\r\nfrom having the authority of an exact science; many of its\r\nphenomena are as yet inexplicable, and many differences of\r\nopinion among the learned remain unreconciled on points at first\r\nsight apparently easy to be settled.\r\n\r\nMeteorology has advanced very far beyond its original limits.\r\nSpherical vapor and atmospheric space give but a faint idea of its\r\nrange. We find it a leading science in Physics, and having intimate\r\nrelations with heat, light, electricity, magnetism, winds, water,\r\nvegetation, geological changes, optical effects, pneumatics,\r\ngeography,--and with climate, controlling the pursuits and\r\naffecting the character of the human race. It is so intimately\r\nblended, indeed, with the other matters here named, as scarcely to\r\nhave any positive boundary of its own; and its vista seems ever\r\nlengthening, as we proceed.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling upon the numerous consequences which flow from\r\nmeteorological influences, let us see what is properly included under\r\nthe subject of Meteorology. And first, of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis is a gaseous, vapor-bearing, elastic fluid, surrounding the\r\nearth. Its volume is estimated at 1/29th, and its weight at about\r\n43/1000ths, that of the globe. It is composed of 21 parts in weight\r\nof Oxygen and 77 of Nitrogen, with a little Carbonic Acid,\r\nAqueous Vapor, and a trace of Carburetted Hydrogen. There are\r\nnumerous well-known calculations of the proportions of the various\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere, which we owe to Priestley, Dalton,\r\nBlack, Cavendish, Liebig, and others; but that given by Professor\r\nAnsted is sufficiently simple and intelligible. In 10 volumes or\r\nparts of it, he gives to\r\n\r\nOxygen, the great supporter of life    2.100\r\nNitrogen, (not condensible under 50\r\n  atmospheres, and not respirable or\r\n  combustible,)                        7.750\r\nAqueous Vapor                           .l42\r\nCarbonic Acid                           .004\r\nCarburetted Hydrogen                    .004\r\n                                      ______\r\n                                      10.000\r\n\r\nand he adds a trace of Ammoniacal Vapor. It is _usual_ to state the\r\nproportions of air as being 1 Oxygen to 4 Nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that, while there are six varieties of compounds\r\nof nitrogen and oxygen, but one of these is fitted to sustain life,\r\nand that is our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is well enough to note, that, when we use the word volume or\r\nmeasure, in speaking of the atmosphere or any gaseous body, we adopt\r\nthe theory of Gay-Lussac, who discovered that gases unite with each\r\nother in definite proportions whenever they enter into combination.\r\nThis theory led to important results; for by knowing the elements of a\r\ncompound gas, we easily determine its specific gravity.\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted to apply the principle to organic bodies;\r\nbut it has not yet been carried to a full and satisfactory\r\nconclusion. It may be noticed, too, that Dalton affirmed that\r\nsimple substances unite with each other in definite weights\r\nto form compound substances, thus supporting the idea of\r\nLussac. These discoveries were made about the same time,\r\nDalton having the credit of originating them. Various modifications\r\nof the principle have been from time to time presented to public\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWhether the constituents of the atmosphere are chemically or\r\nmechanically combined,--one of the things about which the learned are\r\nnot fully agreed,--it is found to be chemically the same in its\r\nconstituents, all over the world, whether collected on mountains or on\r\nplains, on the sea or on the land, whether obtained by aëronauts miles\r\nabove the earth or by miners in their deepest excavations. On the\r\ntheory of its mechanical combination, however, as by volume, and that\r\neach constituent acts freely for itself and according to its own laws,\r\nimportant speculations (conclusions, indeed) have arisen, both as\r\nregards temperature and climatic differences. It should be observed,\r\nthat volume, as we have used the word, is the apparent space occupied,\r\nand differs from mass, which is the _effective_ space occupied, or the\r\nreal bulk of matter, while density is the relation of mass to volume,\r\nor the quotient resulting from the division of the one by the other.\r\nThose empty spaces which render the volume larger than the mass are\r\ntechnically called its pores.\r\n\r\nHas the composition of the atmosphere changed in the lapse of years?\r\nOn this point both French and German philosophers have largely\r\nspeculated. It is computed that it contains about two millions of\r\ncubic geographical miles of oxygen, and that 12,500 cubic geographical\r\nmiles of carbonic acid have been breathed out into the air or\r\notherwise given out in the course of five thousand years. The\r\ninference, then, should be, that the latter exists in the air in the\r\nproportion of 1 to 160, whereas we find but 4 parts in 10,000. Dumas\r\nand Bossingault decided that no change had taken place, verifying\r\ntheir conclusion by experiments founded on observations for more than\r\nthirty-five years. No _chemical_ combination of oxygen and nitrogen\r\nhas ever been detected in the atmosphere, and it is presumed none will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere possesses, as may be readily imagined, many important\r\ncharacteristics. One of these is Weight.\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated by simple, yet decisive experiments. The\r\ndiscovery of the _fact_ is attributed to the illustrious Galileo, but\r\nto modern science we owe all the certainty, variety, and elegance of\r\nthe demonstration. A vessel containing a quantity of air is weighed;\r\nthe air is exhausted from it and it is weighed again. An accurate\r\nscale will then detect the difference of weight. A cubic foot of air\r\nweighs 1.2 oz. Hence a column of air of one inch in diameter and a\r\nmile in height weighs 44 oz.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is supposed to have an elevation of from 45 to 50\r\nmiles, but its weight diminishes in proportion to its height. The\r\nwhole pressure at the surface of the earth is estimated to be 15 lbs.\r\nto the square inch; a person of ordinary size is consequently pressed\r\nupon by a weight of from 13 to 14 tons. Happily for us, the pressure\r\nfrom without is counteracted by the pressure from within.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the air is of great importance in the economy of Nature,\r\nsince it prevents the excessive evaporation of the waters upon the\r\nearth's surface, and limits its extent by unalterable laws. Water\r\nboils at a certain temperature when at the earth's surface, where the\r\nweight of the atmosphere is greatest, but at different temperatures at\r\ndifferent elevations from the surface. At the level of the sea it\r\nboils at 212°. On the high plains of Quito, 8,724 feet above the sea,\r\nit boils at 194°, and an egg cannot be cooked there in an open vessel.\r\nAt Potosí the boiling-point is still lower, being 188°, and the\r\nbarometrical column stands at 18°. Indeed, the experiment is often\r\nexhibited at our chemical lectures, of a flask containing a small\r\nquantity of water, which, exhausted of air, is made to boil by the\r\nordinary heat of the hand.\r\n\r\nFahrenheit proposed to ascertain the height of mountains by this\r\nprinciple, and a simple apparatus was contrived for the purpose, which\r\nis now in successful use. The late Professor Forbes of Edinburgh,\r\nwhose untimely death the friends of science have had so much reason to\r\ndeplore, ascertained that the temperature of boiling water varied\r\narithmetically with the height, and at the rate of one degree of the\r\nthermometric scale for every 549.05 feet. Multiplying the difference\r\nof the boiling-point by this number of feet, we have the elevation.\r\nThe weight of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, is also a\r\nmeans for ascertaining the height of mountains or of plains; but\r\ncorrection must be made for the effects of expansion or contraction,\r\nand for capillarity, or the attraction between the mercury and the\r\nglass tube, at least whenever great exactness is required. Tables for\r\nthe convenience of calculation are given in several scientific works,\r\nand particularly in a paper of Professor Forbes, Ed. Trans. Vol. 15.\r\nBriefly, however, we may state, that between 0° and 32°, 34\r\nthousandths of an inch must be allowed for depression or contraction,\r\nand between 32° and 52° 33 thousandths. The weight of the atmosphere\r\nis not only affected by rarefaction, but by currents of air, which\r\ngive it a sudden density or rarity. Those who have ascended mountains\r\nhave experienced both these changes.\r\n\r\nA common experiment to prove the weight of air is that of the\r\nMagdeburg Hemispheres, a simple contrivance of Otto Guericke, a\r\nmerchant of that city. It is a part of every complete philosophical\r\napparatus. It consists of brass caps, which, when joined together, fit\r\ntightly and become a globe. The air within being exhausted, it will be\r\nfound difficult to separate them. If the superficies be 100 square\r\ninches and the height of the mercury be 30 inches, the atmosphere will\r\npress on these hemispheres with a weight of 1,475 lbs, requiring the\r\nefforts of seven or eight powerful men to tear them asunder. One of\r\nthese instruments, of the diameter of a German ell, required the\r\nstrength of 24 horses to separate it. The experiment was publicly made\r\nin 1650 at the Imperial Diet at Rendsborg, in the presence of the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand III. and a large number of princes and nobles, much\r\nto their astonishment.\r\n\r\nAs compared with water, the air (the barometer indicating 30°, and the\r\nthermometer 55°) is 833 times lighter.\r\n\r\nIt is this weight of the atmosphere which counterbalances that of a\r\ncolumn of mercury 29 inches in height, and a column of water 32 to 34\r\nfeet in height.\r\n\r\nThe old quaint notion of Nature's abhorring a vacuum was found to be\r\npractically only an assertion that the air had weight. The ordinary\r\npump, commonly called the suction-pump, is constructed on this\r\nprinciple. The weight of the atmosphere at the level of the sea is\r\nfound to be the same all over the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find the atmosphere with another characteristic,--Elasticity.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be compressed, air returns, on liberation, to its\r\noriginal volume, and while thus perfectly elastic it is also the most\r\ncompressible of bodies. This elasticity arises from the repulsive\r\nforce of its particles, and is always equal to the compressive force\r\nwhich it balances. A glass vessel full of air, placed under a receiver\r\nand then exhausted by the air-pump, will burst into atoms. Water, on\r\nthe other hand, is almost the reverse. Twenty cubic inches, introduced\r\ninto a cannon whose sides are three inches thick, cannot be compressed\r\ninto nineteen inches without bursting it. This non-elastic property of\r\nwater, with another, that of communicating, when under the action of\r\nany force, an equal pressure in all directions, led to the invention\r\nof the hydraulic press.\r\n\r\nThe elasticity of the air enables fishes to rise and sink in water,\r\nthrough the action of the air-bladder.\r\n\r\nThe sudden compression of air liberates its latent heat, and produces\r\nfire. On this principle the pneumatic tinder-box is constructed.\r\n\r\nBrockhaus says that air has as yet been compressed only into\r\none-eighth of its original bulk.\r\n\r\nFor every degree of heat between the freezing-point and the boiling-point,\r\n32° and 212°, the expansion of air is about 1/490th part, so that\r\nany invention which seeks to use rarefied air as a motive power\r\nmust employ a very intense degree of heat, enough to fuse many kinds\r\nof metals.\r\n\r\nTo the celebrated Mr. Boyle and to Henry Cavendish, both of Great\r\nBritain, we are indebted for most of what we know of this particular\r\nproperty of the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDensity, or closeness, is another quality of the atmosphere. It has\r\nbeen found to be 770 times less than that of water, and 770 cubic\r\ninches of air weigh as much as a cubic inch of water. It is in direct\r\nratio with its elasticity, and there are tables by which it may be\r\ndetermined at different altitudes. At the surface of the earth, this\r\ndensity is indicated as 1; at 2-1/2 miles, as 1/2; at 5 miles, as 1/4;\r\nand so on, the difference being in a geometrical progression.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed in the consideration of our general subject, we shall\r\nfind, under the appropriate heads, that density is not without\r\nmaterial influence on reflection and refraction, on transparency and\r\nthe transmission of light, the presence or absence of moisture, and\r\nthe amount of heat at the earth's surface,--and we might add, on\r\nhealth, and the increase or diminution of the vital energies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTemperature is another branch of our subject, and one involving a\r\nseries of subordinate topics on which volumes have been written, and\r\nto which are still devoted the labors of the most learned men of our\r\nday. In this place, merely an out-line can be attempted.\r\n\r\nTemperature is the degree of heat or cold in the particles of all\r\nbodies, which is perceptible by sensation, and is measurable by their\r\nexpansion or contraction. It is the key to the theory of the winds, of\r\nrain, of aerial and oceanic currents, of vegetation and climate with\r\nall their multifarious and important differences. While the inclined\r\nposition of the earth on its axis and its movement in its elliptical\r\norbit influence the general amount of heat, it is rather to the\r\nconsequences of these in detail that we are called when we speak of\r\ntemperature. If the sun shone on a uniformly level surface, everywhere\r\nof the same conducting and radiating power, there would be but little\r\ndifficulty in tracing the monotonous effects of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe reformer Luther, as eccentric as he was learned and sincere, is\r\nreported to have said, that, if he had been consulted at the Creation,\r\nhe would have placed the sun directly over the centre of the world and\r\nkept it there, to give unchanging and uniform light and heat! It is\r\ncertainly much better that he was not consulted. In that case, every\r\nparallel of latitude would have been isothermal, or of equal mean\r\nannual temperature. The seasons would have been invariable in\r\ncharacter. Some portions of the earth would have been scorched to\r\ncrispness, others locked up in never-changing ice.\r\n\r\nVegetation, instead of being universal, would have been confined to a\r\nnarrow zone; and the whole human race would have been driven together\r\ninto one limited habitable space, to interfere with, incommode, and\r\ndestroy each other. The arrangement is best as it is.\r\n\r\nWe find very important modifications of temperature, occasioned not\r\nonly by astronomical influences, but by local causes and geographical\r\ncharacteristics. For while, as a general rule, the nearer we approach\r\nthe equator, the warmer we shall be, yet temperature is greatly\r\naffected by mountains, seas, currents of air or water, by radiation,\r\nby forests, and by vegetation. It is found, in fact, that the lines of\r\ntemperature, (the happy conception of Humboldt,) when they are traced\r\nupon the map, are anything but true zones or circles.\r\n\r\nThe line of the greatest mean warmth is not coincident with the\r\nequator, but falls to the north of it. This line at 160° W. Long, from\r\nGreenwich is 4° below the geographical equator; at 80° it is about 6°\r\nnorth, sweeping along the coast of New Granada; at 20° it comes down\r\nand touches the equator; at 40° E. Long., it crosses the Red Sea about\r\n16° north of the equator, and at 120° it falls at Borneo, several\r\ndegrees below it;--and the points of the greatest heat, in this line,\r\nare in Abyssinia, nearer the tropic of Cancer than to the equator. On\r\nthe other hand, the greatest mean cold points, according to the\r\nopinions of Humboldt, Sir David Brewster, and others, do not coincide,\r\nas would seem natural, with the geographical poles, but they are both\r\nto be found in the northern hemisphere, in Latitude 80°, 95°E. Long.\r\nand 100° W. Long. from Greenwich. The western is ascertained to be\r\n4-1/2° colder than the eastern or Siberian. If this be the fact,--but\r\nit is not positively admitted,--an open sea at the pole may be\r\nconsidered as probable, on the ground of its having a higher mean\r\ntemperature than is found at 80°. Kaemptz places one of these cold\r\npoints at the north of Barrow's Straits,--the other near Cape Taimur,\r\nin Siberia. Burghaus, in his Atlas, transfers the American cold pole\r\nto 78° N. Lat. It is perhaps too early to determine rigorously the\r\ntrue temperature of these points.\r\n\r\nA noticeable fact also is this,--that places in the same latitude\r\nrarely receive the same amount of heat. Quebec, in British America,\r\nand Drontheim, in Norway, enjoy about the same quantity, while the\r\nformer is in 47° and the latter in 68° N. Lat. The mean winter\r\ntemperature of Pekin, 39° 45' N. Lat., is 5° below the freezing-point;\r\nwhile at Naples, which is north of Pekin, it seldom, if ever, goes\r\nbelow it, and Paris, 500 miles farther north, has a mean winter\r\ntemperature of 6° above the freezing-point. The city of New York,\r\nabout 11° south of London, has a winter temperature of much greater\r\nseverity. The mean temperature of the State of New York, as determined\r\nby a long series of observations, is 44° 31'.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of countries is found to be very stable, and but\r\nvery small variations have been detected in modern times. But that\r\nthere have been important climatic changes, since the Christian era,\r\ncannot be doubted, unless we doubt history. Not many centuries ago, it\r\nwas a common thing for all the British rivers to freeze up during the\r\nwinter, and to remain so for several months. If space permitted, an\r\ninteresting statement could he made of the changes which have taken\r\nplace in vegetation in Greenland, and throughout certain northern\r\nparts of Europe,--also in Palestine, Greece, and other southern\r\ncountries,--while we know that the earth's inclination upon its axis\r\nhas been unchanged.\r\n\r\nMrs. Somerville remarks, that, though the temperature of any one place\r\nmay be subject to very great variations, yet it never differs from the\r\nmean state more than a few degrees.\r\n\r\nWithout this atmospheric covering of ours, it is considered that the\r\ntemperature of the earth at its surface would be the same as that of\r\nthe celestial spaces, supposed to be at least 76° below zero, or\r\n_possibly_, says Humboldt, 1400° below! Human life, without our\r\natmosphere, could not exist for a single moment.\r\n\r\nIt is computed, that, if the annual heat received by the earth on its\r\nsurface could be equally distributed over it, it would melt, in the\r\ncourse of a year, a stratum of ice 46 feet thick, though it covered\r\nthe whole globe, and as a consequence the amount of unradiated heat\r\nwould render it uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThe relative position of the sun affects temperature, rather than its\r\ndistance. In winter the earth is three millions of miles nearer the\r\nsun than in summer, but the oblique rays of the former season reach us\r\nin less quantity than the more direct The distribution of land and\r\nwater, the nature of the soil, the indentation of bays, the elevation\r\nof land above the sea-level, insularity, etc., all, as we have already\r\nsuggested, have a modifying influence on temperature.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere possesses also a reflecting and refracting power,\r\narising from its varying density, and, perhaps, in the latter case,\r\nsomewhat from its lenticular outline.\r\n\r\nBut for this property we should have no twilight. The sun, instead of\r\nsending up his beams while 18° below the visible horizon, would come\r\nupon us out of an intense darkness, pass over our sky a brazen\r\ninglorious orb, and set in an instant amid unwelcome night.\r\n\r\nReflection is the rebound of the rays of light or heat from an\r\nopposing surface at the same angle as that at which they fall upon it.\r\nThese are called angles of incidence and reflection, and are equal.\r\n\r\nRefraction is the bending of a ray passing obliquely from a rarer into\r\na denser medium. This may be observed when a rod is placed slantingly\r\nin a vessel of clear water; the part immersed will appear bent or\r\nbroken. This is ordinary refraction. Terrestrial refraction is the\r\nsame thing, occurring whenever there is a difference of density in the\r\naerial strata.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere absorbs some portion of the light which it receives. It\r\nis not all reflected or refracted or even penetrative.\r\n\r\nObjects seen under various degrees of light, either convected or\r\nretarded by different media, appear near or distant, distinct or\r\nconfused. Thus, we are often surprised at the apparent nearness and\r\nbrightness of an opposite shore or neighboring island, in some\r\nconditions of the air, while at other times they seem distant and lie\r\nin shadowy obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe looming up of a vessel on the water is another common instance of\r\nthe principle of refraction.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed by almost every one, that, during the warm and\r\nmoist nights of summer, the moon, as she rises above the horizon,\r\nappears much larger than when at the zenith. So the setting sun is\r\nseen of apparently increased size. Sir John Herschel asserts that the\r\nappearance is an illusion, and so do some others. Professor Carey\r\nsays, that, if we look through a paper tube at the moon when on the\r\nhorizon, the paper being folded so as to make the aperture of its\r\nexact size, and then look again at it when it reaches the zenith, we\r\nshall find there is no difference.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an experiment is offered by a German Professor, of\r\nthe name of Milo, of this kind: If we look through a tube so\r\nconstructed as to have one side filled with spirits of wine and the\r\nother with common air, the half of the object seen through the former\r\nwill be found to appear much larger to the eye than the other half\r\nseen through the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down, that, where extraordinary refraction takes place\r\nlaterally or vertically, the visual angle of the spectator is\r\nsingularly enlarged, and objects are magnified, as if seen through a\r\ntelescope. Dr. Scoresby, a celebrated meteorologist and navigator,\r\nmentions some curious instances of the effects of refraction seen by\r\nhim in the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable phenomena attend this state of the atmosphere, known\r\nas the Fata Morgana of Sicily, the Mirage of the Desert, the Spectre\r\nof the Brocken, and the more common exhibitions of halos, coronæ, and\r\nmock suns. The Mountain House at Catskill has repeatedly been seen\r\nbrightly pictured on the clouds below. Rainbows are also due to this\r\ncondition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe might occupy the remainder of the space allowed us by enlarging on\r\nvarious topics which belong to this part of our subject. The twilight\r\ngray, the hues of the evening and morning sky, the peculiarity of the\r\nred rays of light, the scintillation of stars, their flashing changes\r\nof colors, are all meteorological in their character, as well as\r\nstrikingly beautiful and interesting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPolarity of light is another of the wonders of which Meteorology takes\r\ncognizance. The celebrated Malus, in 1808, while looking at the light\r\nof the setting sun shining upon the windows of the Luxembourg, was led\r\nto the discovery that a beam of light which was reflected at a certain\r\nangle from transparent and opaque bodies, or by transmission through\r\nseveral plates of uncrystallized bodies, or of bodies crystallized and\r\npossessing the property of double refraction, changed its character,\r\nso as to have sides, to revolve around poles peculiar to itself, and\r\nto be incapable of a second reflection. The angle of polarity was\r\nfound to be 54°.\r\n\r\nThe beam of polarized light was also found to have the peculiar\r\nproperty of penetrating into the molecules of bodies, illuminating\r\nthem and, enabling the eye to determine as to their structure. The\r\nproduction of beautiful spectres, prismatic colors of gorgeous hues,\r\nand the most remarkable system of rings, has followed the discovery,\r\nand important results are expected from the continuation of the\r\nresearches. It has already enabled the astronomer to determine what\r\nheavenly bodies do or do not shine with their own light. The subject\r\nis still under investigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColor from light comes also under the notice of the meteorologist. The\r\nreceived opinion is, that there is no inherent color in any object we\r\nlook at, but that it is in the light itself which falls upon and is\r\nreflected from the object. Each object, having a particular reflecting\r\nsurface of its own, throws back light at its own angle, absorbing some\r\nrays and dispersing others, while it preserves its own. In this sense\r\nit may be said that the rose has no color,--its hues are only\r\nborrowed. If the idea should be carried out, it would certainly\r\ndestroy much of the poetry of color. Thus, in praising the modest\r\nblush which crimsons the cheek of beauty, we should destroy all its\r\ncharm, if we attributed it to a sudden change in the reflecting\r\nsurface of the epidermis,--a mere mechanical rushing of blood to the\r\nskin, and a corresponding change in its angle of reflection!\r\n\r\nWithout light, however, there is no color. Agriculturists and chemists\r\nunderstand this. Plants without light retain their oxygen, which\r\nbleaches them.\r\n\r\nThe theory of color has never been fully agreed upon. Some writers\r\nmaintain that the character of its hues depends on the number of\r\nundulations of a ray. Goethe's theory is substantially, that colors\r\nare produced by the thinning or thickening and obstructing of light.\r\nBrewster contends that there are but three primary colors,--red,\r\nyellow, and blue. Wollaston finds four,--red, yellowish green, blue,\r\nand violet. But this, as well as the consideration of the solar\r\nspectrum of Newton, is more the specialty of Optics. The atmospheric\r\nrelations of color are more apposite to our purpose.\r\n\r\nThe color of the clouds, which may be occasionally affected by\r\nelectricity, is owing to the state of the atmosphere and its\r\nreflecting and refracting properties.\r\n\r\nThe color of snow is white because it is composed of an infinite\r\nvariety of crystals, which reflect all the colors of light, absorbing\r\nnone, and these, uniting before they reach the eye, appear white,\r\nwhich is the combination of all the colors.\r\n\r\nWind, the atmosphere in action, though not picturesque, is always\r\nwonderful, often terrible and sublime. The origin of wind, its\r\ndirection and its force, its influence on the health of man, his\r\nbusiness, his dwelling-place, and the climate where he perpetuates his\r\nrace, have attracted the profound attention of the greatest\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nTo the rarefaction of the air at the equator, and the daily revolution\r\nof the earth, is attributed the origin of the Trade-Winds, which blow\r\nfrom the east or a little to the north of east, north of the equator,\r\nand east or south of east after we are south of the equator. The hot\r\ncurrent of ascending air is replaced by cold winds from the poles.\r\n\r\nBut why are we not constantly subject to the action of north winds,\r\nwhich we rarely are? Because of the diurnal motion of the earth, which\r\nat the equator equals one thousand miles an hour, the polar winds in\r\ncoming down to the equator do not have any such velocity, because\r\nthere is a less comparative diurnal speed in the higher latitudes. The\r\nair at the poles revolves upon itself without moving forward;--at the\r\nequator, the velocity, as we have mentioned, is enormous. If, then,\r\nsays Professor Schleiden, we imagine the air from the pole to be\r\ncarried to the equator, some time must elapse before it will acquire\r\nthe same velocity of motion from west to east which is always found\r\nthere. Therefore it would remain behind, the earth gliding, as it\r\nwere, from beneath it; or, in other words, it would have the\r\nappearance of an east wind. Lieutenant Maury adopts the same\r\nexplanation. It is, indeed, that of Halley, slightly modified.\r\n\r\nThe warm air, ascending from the equatorial regions, rushes to the\r\npoles to be cooled in turn, sliding over the heavy strata of cold air\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe northern trade-wind prevails in the Pacific between 2° and 25° of\r\nN. Latitude; the southern trade, between 10° and 21° of S. Latitude.\r\nIn the Atlantic the trades are generally limited by the 8th and 28th\r\ndegrees of N. Latitude. The region of calms lies between these trades,\r\nand beyond them are what are styled the Variables. In the former the\r\nseaman finds baffling winds, rain, and storms. Occasionally, from\r\ncauses not yet fully explained, north and south periodical winds break\r\nin upon them, such as the Northers which rage in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere are many curious facts connected with the Trades, and with the\r\nMonsoons, or trade-winds turned back by continental heat in the East\r\nIndies, the Typhoons, the Siroccos, the Harmattans, land and sea\r\nbreezes and hurricanes, the Samiel or Poison Wind, and the Etesian.\r\nThe Cyclones, or rotary hurricanes, offer a most inviting field for\r\nobservation and study, and are an important branch of our subject. But\r\nwe are obliged to omit the consideration of these topics, to be taken\r\nup, possibly, at some other opportunity. The theory of the Cyclones\r\nmay be justly considered as original with our countryman, Mr.\r\nRedfield. Colonel Reid, Mr. Piddington, and other learned Englishmen\r\nhave adopted it; and so much has been settled through the labors of\r\nthese eminent men, that intelligent seamen need fear these storms no\r\nlonger. By the aid of maps and sailing-directions they may either\r\nescape them altogether, or boldly take advantage of their outward\r\nsweep, and shorten their passages.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to ascertain the causes of the many local winds prevailing\r\nboth on the ocean and the land, and which do not appear to be\r\ninfluenced by any such general principle as the Trades or the\r\nMonsoons.\r\n\r\nThe force of air in motion gives us the gentle breeze, the gale, or\r\nthe whirlwind. At one hundred miles an hour it prostrates forests. In\r\nthe West Indies, thirty-two pound cannon have been torn by it from\r\ntheir beds, and carried some distance through the air. Tables of the\r\nvelocity of winds are familiar to our readers.\r\n\r\nLet us next advert to the connection of the atmosphere with Vapor and\r\nEvaporation. The vapor rising from the earth and the sea by\r\nevaporation, promoted by dry air, by wind, by diminished pressure, or\r\nby heat, is borne along in vesicles so rare as to float on the bosom\r\nof the winds, sometimes a grateful shade of clouds, at other times\r\ncondensed and gravitating in showers of rain. Thus it enriches the\r\nsoil, or cools the air, or reflects back to the earth its radiated\r\nheat. At times the clouds, freighted with moisture, present the most\r\ngorgeous hues, and we have over us a pavilion more magnificent than\r\nany ever constructed by the hand of man. These clouds are not merely\r\nthe distilleries of rain, but the reservoirs of snow and hail, and\r\nthey are the agents of electric and magnetic storms.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their variety, clouds are easily classified, and are\r\nnow by universal consent distinguished as follows.\r\n\r\nIn the higher regions of the air we look for the Cirri, the Curl\r\nClouds. They are light, lie in long ranges, apparently in the\r\ndirection of the magnetic pole, and are generally curled up at one\r\nextremity. They are sometimes called Mackerel Clouds. They are\r\ncomposed of thin white filaments, disposed like woolly hair, feather\r\ncrests, or slender net-work. They generally indicate a change of\r\nweather, and a disturbance of the electric condition of the\r\natmosphere. When they descend into the lower regions of the air, they\r\narrange themselves in horizontal sheets and lose much of their\r\noriginal type. The Germans call them Windsbäume, or wind-trees.\r\n\r\nThe Cumulus is another form of cloud, which floats along in fleecy\r\nmasses, in the days of summer, but dissolves at night. Sometimes it\r\nresembles a great stack or pile of snow, sometimes it has a silvery or\r\na golden edge, as if we saw a little of the lining. Sometimes they lie\r\nmotionless in the distance, and are mistaken by mariners for land.\r\nThey rest upon a large base, and are borne along by surface-winds.\r\nTheir greatest height is not more than two miles. They carry large\r\nquantities of moisture with them, and, when preceding rain, fall\r\nrapidly into other shapes.\r\n\r\nThe Stratus, or Fall Cloud, is horizontal in its figure, lies near the\r\nearth, and its length is usually greater than its breadth. It floats\r\nin long bands with rounded or sharpened points, and is seen rising\r\nfrom rivers or lakes, at first as a fog. In the morning it indicates\r\nfine weather. The Fall Cloud never discharges rain.\r\n\r\nThis comes only from the Nimbus, which is quite unlike the others. It\r\nputs on a dark gray color, has irregular transparent edges, and\r\nincreases rapidly so as to obscure the sky. It appears to absorb the\r\nother clouds, to be a union of their differently electrified\r\nparticles, which are attracted to each other, form drops of water, and\r\ndescend as rain.\r\n\r\nOf the first three forms we have three modifications or varieties. The\r\nCirro-Cumulus is a congeries of roundish little clouds in close\r\nhorizontal position, varying in size and roundness, and often, to use\r\nthe words of the poet Bloomfield, appearing as \"The beauteous\r\nsemblance of a flock at rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cirro-Stratus is more compact than the Cirrus,--the strata being\r\ninclined or horizontal. It is sometimes seen cutting the moon's disc\r\nwith a sharp line. The Cumulo-Stratus, or Twain Cloud, is denser than\r\nthe Cumulus, and more ragged in its outlines. It overhangs its base in\r\nfolds, and often bears perched on its summit some other form of cloud,\r\nwhich inosculates itself with it. Sometimes a Cirro-Stratus cloud\r\ncomes along and fastens itself to it parasitically. It is one of our\r\nmost picturesque forms of clouds.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two years we have twice observed in the city of New\r\nYork, during the summer afternoons, large masses of clouds coming over\r\nfrom the southwest, and hanging rather low, which could not be well\r\nplaced in any of the classes already described, or recognized as such\r\nby meteorologists. They consisted of a great number of hemispherical\r\nforms of large diameter, hanging vertically from a Stratus cloud or\r\nplane above them, and to which they appeared attached. They were\r\nregular in shape, and very distinct; they barely touched each other,\r\nand were of a gray color. They might be compared to a hay-field turned\r\nupside down, with innumerable hay-cocks hanging below it.\r\nUnfortunately, the circumstances under which the spectacle was\r\nobserved did not; admit of any resort to the barometer, thermometer,\r\nor anemometer. Should further observations verify these remarks, it\r\nmight perhaps be proper to style this variety the Hemispherical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDew is another atmospheric product. It is the condensation of the\r\nwarmer vapor of the atmosphere, in calm and serene nights, and in the\r\nabsence of clouds, by the cold surface of bodies on which it rests. In\r\nsome countries it is copious enough to supply the want of rain. The\r\nearth radiates its own acquired heat, grows colder than the\r\natmosphere, and so condenses it.\r\n\r\nWhat is thermometrically called the dew-point is that degree at which\r\nthe moisture present in the atmosphere, on being subjected to a\r\ndecrease of temperature, begins to be precipitated or condensed. It is\r\nthe same as the point of saturation. Daniell calls it \"the constituent\r\ntemperature of atmospheric vapor.\" It is our criterion for\r\nascertaining how much moisture there is in the air, and at what degree\r\nof heat or cold it would be precipitated. When the air is saturated, a\r\ndry bulb and a wet bulb will read alike.\r\n\r\nThe dew-point has been a puzzle to most persons. Very few treatises\r\nexplain it satisfactorily. The definition just given, though explicit,\r\nis not quite enough. For it will be perceived that an ordinary\r\nsubtraction of the degrees of temperature on a wet thermometer, which\r\nhad cooled down by evaporation, from the actual temperature indicated\r\nby a dry thermometer, will not give us the dew-point.\r\n\r\nFor example,--if a free or dry thermometer indicates 63°, and the one\r\nwith the wet bulb has by evaporation cooled down to 54°, the\r\ndifference would be 9°. The dew-point would not be 54°, but that\r\ndegree to which the mercury would fall in the free thermometer, for\r\nthe atmosphere to become saturated with the quantity of moisture then\r\nactually existing in it. It would be 46.8°.\r\n\r\nThis dew-point, which figures so largely in all well-kept\r\nmeteorological reports, is the key to many important conditions of the\r\natmosphere, affecting health, vegetation, and climate.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the air at different degrees of heat has different\r\ndegrees of elasticity, different degrees of tension, and different\r\ndegrees of capacity to hold vapor. Dalton, by a series of experiments\r\nwith barometer-tubes, into which he introduced air and vapor at\r\ncertain temperatures, found what its force was upon the mercurial\r\ncolumn from degree to degree. He also experimentally determined the\r\nratio of the weight of moisture and of air, the former being five-eights\r\nof the latter,--in other words, how many grains of moisture\r\nadditional could be held by the air, advancing from degree to degree\r\nof temperature. This being ascertained, a table of factors was\r\nconstructed, in other words, a set of figures contrived, which should,\r\nby a multiplication of the subtracted difference between the range of\r\nthe dry bulb and the wet bulb of the thermometers, furnish the amount\r\nof deduction from the former which would indicate the dew-point, or\r\nthe point to which the mercury in the dry thermometer must fall to\r\nshow how much more moisture the air could hold without its\r\ncondensation. These tables of factors have been constructed at the\r\nGreenwich Observatory, and are generally used.\r\n\r\nThe Hygrometer, invented by Mr. Daniell, gives the dew-point by\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nIt is an error to suppose that dew falls like rain from the air; it\r\nforms on the body which is cooled down below the temperature of the\r\nair. It differs in quantity with the radiating or cooling surface;\r\nthat which has absorbed and retained the most heat during the day\r\nradiates the most at night and furnishes the most cold in return.\r\n\r\nHoar-frost, such as we find on our window-panes, or on the grass, is\r\nthe moisture of the warm air cooled down and frozen, and is produced\r\nwhen the cold at the surface is below the freezing-point. What we in\r\ncommon parlance call the action of frost, and which in this climate is\r\nwell known to be very powerful, is not particularly injurious to\r\norganized bodies.\r\n\r\nMists are the vapor near the ground rendered visible by the\r\ntemperature of the air falling below that of the vapor. When we see\r\nour breath in a cold morning, we see a mist. Where the surface is\r\ncomparatively warm and damp, and the air is cooler, we have mists,\r\nwhich, if dense, are called fogs. These are found plentifully on the\r\nbanks of Newfoundland; and with icebergs on the one hand and the Gulf\r\nStream on the other, we must always expect to have them.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of rain, which is one of the offices of the clouds,\r\nis another of the more important features of Meteorology. The amount\r\nof water taken up by evaporation into the atmosphere is almost\r\nincredible. It is calculated by Lieutenant Maury that there is\r\nannually taken up in the torrid zone a belt of water three thousand\r\nmiles in breadth and sixteen feet deep. Rain occurs regularly and\r\nirregularly in different parts of the earth. In some places it may be\r\ncalculated upon to a day; in others it is quite unknown. Latitude and\r\nlongitude may indicate the points of distribution, but the causes are\r\ndependent on temperature, winds, locality, and, what may seem a\r\nstrange assertion, upon the conduct of man himself. The greatest\r\nquantity falls near the equator, diminishing towards the poles.\r\nMuch more falls on islands and coasts than in the interior of\r\ncontinents,--more in the region of the variables and less in that of\r\nthe trades. There are, however, tropical countries of great extent\r\nwhere rain is scarcely ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe influence of man upon rain is seen in the progress of\r\ncivilization, the destruction of forests, and the drying-up of meres,\r\nswamps, and water-courses.\r\n\r\nForests undoubtedly affect the distribution of rain, and the supplies\r\nof streams and springs. Their cooling influence precipitates the vapor\r\npassing over them, and the ground beneath them not getting heated does\r\nnot readily evaporate moisture. Lands, on the contrary, which are\r\ncleared of forests become sooner heated, give off larger quantities of\r\nrarefied air, and the passing clouds are borne away to localities of\r\ngreater atmospheric density.\r\n\r\nThe Canary Islands, when first discovered, were thickly clothed with\r\nforests. Since these have been destroyed, the climate has been dry. In\r\nFuerteventura the inhabitants are sometimes obliged to flee to other\r\nislands to avoid perishing from thirst. Similar instances occur in the\r\nCape Verdes. Parts of Egypt, Syria, and Persia, that once were wooded,\r\nare now arid and sterile deserts.\r\n\r\nIn the temperate zones these results are not so immediately apparent.\r\nIt is now much in doubt whether the climate of our country has changed\r\nits character within the last two hundred years. Jefferson and Dr.\r\nRush both contended that it had. Our oldest inhabitants assert that in\r\ntheir day our winters began nearly two months earlier than they do\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe general laws laid down in relation to rain are these:--\r\n\r\n1. It decreases in quantity as we approach the poles.\r\n\r\n2. It decreases as we pass from maritime to inland countries.\r\n\r\n3. It decreases in the temperate zones on eastern coasts as compared\r\nwith western coasts, but within the tropics it is the reverse.\r\n\r\n4. More rain falls in mountainous than in level countries.\r\n\r\n5. Most rain falls within the tropics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rainless regions, not deserts, are parts of Guatemala, the table-land\r\nof Mexico, the Peruvian coast, parts of Morocco, Egypt, Arabia,\r\nPersia, etc.\r\n\r\nThe electric character of the air is another subject of interest, and\r\na leading one in Meteorology. What can be more magnificent, what more\r\nawful, than those storms of lightning and thunder which are witnessed\r\nsometimes even in our own latitudes?\r\n\r\nFaraday, who as a chemist and philosophical writer is of the highest\r\nauthority, professes to have demonstrated that one single gram of\r\nwater contains as much electricity as can be accumulated in eight\r\nhundred thousand Leyden jars, each requiring to charge it thirty turns\r\nof the large machine at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended that this astounding statement should be received\r\nwithout some grains of allowance; but a very elegant and scientific\r\nwriter, who adopts it without hesitation, adds, \"We can from this\r\ncrystal sphere [of water] evoke heat, light, electricity in enormous\r\nquantities, and beyond these we can see powers or forces for which, in\r\nthe poverty of our ideas and our words, we have not names.\"\r\n\r\nFlashes of electricity have been detected, during warm, close weather,\r\nissuing from some species of plants. The Tuberose and African Marigold\r\nhave been seen to emit these mimic lightnings. (Goethe is the\r\nauthority for this.) To atmospheric electricity we doubtless owe the\r\ncoruscations of the Aurora, one of the most beautiful of our meteors.\r\n\r\nThe usual forms of lightning are the zigzag or forked sharply\r\ndefined,--the sheet-lightning, illuminating a whole cloud, which it\r\nseems to open,--heat-lightning, not emanating from any cloud, but\r\napparently diffused through the air and without report. There are also\r\nfireballs which shoot across the sky, leaving a train often visible\r\nfor seconds and minutes. These last, when they project any masses to\r\nthe earth, are termed aërolites.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric electricity has much to do with the distribution of rain,\r\nthe precipitation of vapor, the condition of our nervous system, and,\r\naccording to Humboldt, with the circulation of the organic juices.\r\nAtmospheric electricity has heretofore been a great obstacle to the\r\nsuccess of the Magnetic Telegraph, and curiously disturbs its\r\noperation; but there has recently been invented an instrument called a\r\nMutator, which is connected with the wires, and carries off all the\r\ndisturbing influences of the atmosphere without interfering with the\r\nworking current. On the other hand, artificially created electricity\r\nhas led to important advances in many of the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nIce is water frozen under a very curious and peculiar law. Hail is the\r\ncongelation of drops of rain in irregular forms, always sudden,--by\r\nsome attributed to electricity and currents of air violently rarefied\r\nby it, and by others to rain-drops falling through a cold stratum of\r\nair and suddenly congealed. Snow, the ermine of the earth, is the\r\ncrystallized moisture of the air, and is in subjection to unchanging\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nWater contracts as it grows colder, until it falls in temperature to\r\n42°. It then expands till it reaches 32°, when it becomes solid,\r\nthough its density is actually diminished, and its specific gravity is\r\nreduced to .929, while that of unfrozen water is 1.000. Of course it\r\nis much lighter, and it floats. This admirable arrangement prevents\r\nour rivers being frozen up and our lakes becoming solid. Ice thickens\r\nbecause it is porous, and allows the heat of the water to pass up and\r\nthe cold to descend; but this is happily a slow process, as ice is a\r\nbad conductor. Salt water freezes at the temperature of 7°, 25° below\r\nfreezing-point. There are many things to be said about ice, whether as\r\nglaciers, or Arctic bergs, or, as it is found sometimes, contrary to\r\nits general law, at the bottom of rivers and ponds, its geological\r\nmovements in the transportation of boulders, and as an article of\r\nluxury;--but we are compelled to leave them for the present.\r\n\r\nSnow, which, in its crystallization, surpasses the most perfect gems,\r\nis invariably found arranged in determinate angles, to wit, 60°, and\r\nits double, 120°, and formed of six-sided prisms. More than one\r\nhundred kinds have been described by Dr. Scoresby and others, and all\r\nthese are combinations of the six-sided prism. The uses of snow, from\r\nits non-conducting qualities, whether as appreciated by the Esquimaux\r\nas a material for huts, or by the agriculturists of our own climate as\r\nsheltering the seed, are too well known to require any particular\r\nremarks. Strange as it may appear, the proximate cause of the\r\nformation of snow is not yet fully agreed upon by the learned.\r\n\r\nThe connection between Sound and the atmosphere is an important one.\r\nThe air is a conductor of sound, and in some conditions one of the\r\nbest. A bell rung in an exhausted receiver gives no sound. In the\r\nArctic regions ordinary conversations have been distinctly heard for\r\nthe distance of a mile and a half.\r\n\r\nAll that we have thus far said in this article bears directly, in some\r\nform or other, on another of the great features of Meteorology, one of\r\nits great objects, and an unceasing topic,--namely, Climate.\r\n\r\nThe term Climate, in its general sense, indicates the changes and\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, such as we have been considering. It has\r\nsomething to do with all of them; it is not entirely controlled by\r\nany. Thus, places having the same mean annual temperature often differ\r\nmaterially in climate. In some (we quote Mrs. Somerville) the winters\r\nare mild and the summers cool, whereas in others the extremes of heat\r\nand cold prevail.\r\n\r\nClimates are not found coincident with lines of latitude; they are\r\nquite as often found parallel to lines of longitude. If you connect\r\nthe extreme points of the mean annual temperatures by a line passing\r\nround the earth, you have a zone, but never a true circle. The curves\r\nare longitudinal.\r\n\r\nClimate is dependent on temperature, winds, the elevation of land,\r\nsoil, ranges of mountains, and proximity of bodies of water; and it is\r\nalso the expression, if we may so term it, of the changes in the\r\natmosphere sensibly affecting our organs. Humboldt refers it to\r\nhumidity, temperature, changes in barometric pressure, calmness or\r\nagitation of the air, amount of electric force, and transparency of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nWhen mountains range themselves in lines of latitude across a\r\ncontinent, they are barriers to civilization, to the mingling of\r\nraces, and the union of states. Thus, the Pyrenees have always kept\r\nFrance and Spain apart, the Alps and the Apennines have secluded\r\nSwitzerland from its neighbors. In our own country, Providence has\r\nplaced our great mountains on a northern and southern axis; the\r\nslopes, the direction, the prevailing winds, the facilities for\r\ntransportation and travel favor no one of our northern, southern, and\r\nwestern States more than another.\r\n\r\nClimate affects vegetation and the distribution of animal life, and\r\nthus greatly modifies commerce.\r\n\r\nWhatever of importance is accomplished in those countries where\r\nclimate has overpowered a race is best and principally done by the men\r\nof the temperate zones, who carry with them perseverance, courage, and\r\nability, and maintain their ascendency, true to their type, while they\r\nhave their life to live.\r\n\r\nBut with our own eyes we may perceive how much climate affects\r\nagriculture. The humidity or dryness of soils, their natural or\r\nacquired heat or cold, the prevailing winds, the quantity of rain, the\r\nsnows, the dews, all affect the planter of the seed and the tiller of\r\nthe ground; they increase or diminish the aggregate of the products of\r\ncountries, the value of their imports and exports,--in short, their\r\nmaterial power, their resources, their influence, their very\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe climate of our own country is exceedingly variable. The\r\ntransitions from heat to cold are very sudden, the range of the\r\nmercury is very great. In the North, we have almost the Arctic\r\nwinters; in the South, almost the peculiarities of the tropics. Of the\r\nState of Pennsylvania it has been said, that in this respect it is a\r\ncompound of all the countries in the world. Mr. Jefferson and Dr.\r\nRush, as before observed, insisted that our climate has changed; and\r\nWilliams, the historian of Vermont, contends that New England has\r\ndeteriorated in its seasons, temperature, harvests, and health, since\r\nits early settlement. Our winds blow from every point of the compass,\r\nbut a due north wind is very rare. Our great western lakes have a\r\nlarge influence on our climate. Some learned men have asserted, that,\r\nif they were land, their area being about ninety-four thousand square\r\nmiles, the region would be so cold as to be scarcely inhabitable.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of our subject. The science itself is by no means\r\nsystematized. Many things are taken for granted which may yet be\r\ndisproved. If, says Humboldt, we perceive a want of connection in the\r\nphenomena of certain sciences, we may anticipate the revelation of new\r\nfacts, whose importance will probably be commensurate with the\r\nattention directed to other branches of study. What we want is a\r\nlarger class of observers, and not only those who are professional\r\npersons, but those who would commune with Nature, and seek to\r\ninvigorate their minds by the acquisition of new ideas, and a recourse\r\nto rich and pure sources of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut more than this. It is a requirement of the present age, says the\r\nsame authority, that there should be an equal appreciation of all\r\nbranches of mathematical and physical science; for the material wealth\r\nand the growing prosperity of nations are principally based upon a\r\nmore enlightened employment of the products and forces of Nature.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has of late years been paid to this subject. Many\r\ndistinguished men in Europe have connected their great reputations\r\nindissolubly with it, and it is absolutely true that more persons are\r\nengaged in a common effort to promote this science than any other of\r\nour time. In Paris there is a large and flourishing society where the\r\nmost brilliant of its savans combine their efforts. In London, that\r\nwhich was established in 1850 has met with remarkable success, and a\r\nmost unexpected crowd of supporters. The finest instruments, the most\r\naccurate observations, and entire uniformity of purpose have been the\r\nresult. In Germany, equal zeal prevails among its naturalists. There\r\nare more than eight hundred stations throughout the world where\r\nregular observations are made, and upwards of three hundred and sixty\r\nof them are in the United States. The Smithsonian Institution has been\r\nalso a wise patron of this science, by its numerous publications, its\r\nlucid directions for observing meteorological changes, and the\r\nbestowal of standard instruments in large numbers to efficient and\r\nwell-placed observers. By a recent arrangement, a portion of this work\r\nis to be performed by the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nObservation, and accuracy in observation, are the foundation of this\r\nscience. The results are compared to the leaves of a book, which will\r\nsome day be arranged and bound together in one volume. The instruments\r\nin use are delicate, ingenious, and indispensable. Their history,\r\nuses, and importance would be topic enough for a separate article.\r\n\r\nWhile at the first view Meteorology may appear to occupy but a limited\r\nsphere, upon a closer examination it will be found to embrace almost\r\nall the sciences, and to be commensurate with Nature itself. It is\r\ncontinually influencing us, by its agencies appealing to our senses,\r\nministering to our wants, and governing our conduct.\r\n\r\nIts influence upon its votaries is equally remarkable; for, as a rule,\r\nthey are distinguished among the learned, their characters are in\r\nharmony with their pursuits, and they are recognized everywhere for\r\ndisinterestedness, philanthropy, and public and private virtue. While\r\nMental Philosophy, has made but little progress since the times of\r\nPlato, and the world is but little better for scholastic disputations,\r\nNatural Science has civilized man, elevated his condition, increased\r\nthe circle of his exertions, and, by the development of some of its\r\nsimplest principles, united the intelligent, the learned, the\r\nenterprising, and the virtuous of all nations into a recognized and a\r\nnoble brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURE-TROVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once, the Castle of Chalus, crowned\r\n  With sullen battlements, stood and frowned\r\n       On the sullen plain around it;\r\n  But Richard of England came one day,\r\n  And the Castle of Chalus passed away\r\n  In such a rapid and sure decay\r\n       No modern yet has found it.\r\n\r\n  Who has not heard of the Lion King\r\n  Who made the harps of the minstrels ring?\r\n       Oh, well they might imagine it\r\n  Hard for chivalry's ranks to show\r\n  A knight more gallant to face a foe,\r\n  With a firmer lance or a heavier blow,\r\n       Than Richard I. Plantagenet;\r\n\r\n  Or gayer withal: for he loved his joke,\r\n  As well as he loved, with slashing stroke,\r\n       The haughtiest helm to hack at:\r\n  Wine or blood he laughingly poured;\r\n  'Twas a lightsome word or a heavy sword,\r\n  As he found a foe or a festive board,\r\n       With a skull or a joke to crack at.\r\n\r\n  Yet some their candid belief avow,\r\n  That, if Richard lived in England now,\r\n       And his lot were only a common one,\r\n  He ne'er had meddled with kings or states,\r\n  But might have been a bruiser of pates\r\n  And champion now of the \"heavy weights,\"--\r\n       A first-rate \"Fighting Phenomenon.\"\r\n\r\n  A vassal bound in peace and war\r\n  To Richard I. was Vidomar,--\r\n       A noble as proud and needy\r\n  As ever before that monarch bowed,\r\n  But not so needy and not so proud\r\n       As the monarch himself was greedy.\r\n\r\nVicomte was he of the Limousin,\r\n  Where stones were thick and crops were thin,\r\n  And profits small and slow to come in.\r\n  But slow and sure, the father's plan, did\r\n  Not suit the son. Sire lived close-handed;\r\n  Became, not rich, but very landed.\r\n  The only debt that ever he made\r\n  Was Nature's debt, and that he paid\r\n  About the time of the Third Crusade,--\r\n  A time when the fashion was fully set\r\n  By Richard of running in tilts and debt,\r\n  When plumes were high and prudence low,\r\n  And every knight felt bound to \"go\r\n  The pace,\" and just like Richard do,\r\n  By running his purse and a Paynim through.\r\n  Yet do not suppose that Vidomar\r\n  Was ever a knight in the Holy War:\r\n  For Richard many a Saracen's head\r\n  Had lopped before the old Count was dead;\r\n  And Richard was home from Palestine,\r\n  Home from the dungeon of Tiernstein,\r\n  And many a Christian corpse had made,\r\n  Ere the time in which the story is laid.\r\n  But the fashion he set became so strong,\r\n  That Vidomar was hurried along,\r\n  And did as many a peer has done\r\n  On reaching a title and twenty-one,\r\n  And met the fate that will meet a peer\r\n  Who lives in state on nothing a year.\r\n  Deserted by all, except some Jews,\r\n  Holding old post-obits and IOUs,\r\n  Who hunted him up and hunted him down,\r\n  He left Limoges, the capital town,\r\n       For his country castle Chalus,\r\n  (As spendthrift lords to Boulogne repair,\r\n  To give their estates a chance to air,)\r\n       And went to turning fallows;\r\n  At least, he ordered it, (much the same,)\r\n  And went himself in pursuit of game\r\n       Or any rural pleasure,\r\n  Till one fine day, as he rode away,\r\n  A serf came running behind to say\r\n  They'd found a crock of treasure.\r\n       No more he thought of hawk or hound,\r\n  But spurred to the spot, and there he found,\r\n       Beyond his boldest thoughts,\r\n  A sum to set him afloat again,--\r\n  The leading figure, 'twas very plain,\r\n       Was followed by several 0s.\r\n\r\n  Oh, who can tell of the schemes that flew\r\n  Through his head, as the treasure met his view,\r\n  And he knew that again his note was good?\r\n  He may have felt as a debtor would\r\n       Who has dodged a dogging dun,\r\n  Or a bank-cashier in his hour of dread\r\n  With brokers behind and breakers ahead,\r\n  Or a blood with his last \"upon the red,\"--\r\n       And each expecting a run.\r\n  What should he do? 'Twas very true\r\n  That all of his debts were overdue;\r\n  But the \"real-whole-souled\" must use their gold\r\n  To run new scores,--not to pay off old.\r\n  That night he lay till the break of day,\r\n       The doubtful question solving:\r\n  Himself in his bed, and that in his head,\r\n       He kept by turns revolving.\r\n\r\n  That selfsame day, not very far\r\n  From the country castle of Vidomar,\r\n       The king had been progressing:\r\n  A courtly phrase, when the king was out\r\n  On a chivalrous bender; any route\r\n  As good as another: what about\r\n       Were little good in guessing.\r\n\r\n  That night, as he sat and drank, he frowned,\r\n  While courtiers moodily stood around,\r\n       All wondering what the journey meant,\r\n  Till a scout reported, \"Treasure found!\"--\r\n  With a rap that made the glasses bound,\r\n  He swore, \"By Arthur's table round,\r\n       I'll have another tournament!\"\r\n\r\n  No more, as he sat and drank, he frowned,\r\n  Or courtiers moodily stood around,\r\n       But all were singing, drinking;\r\n  And louder than all the songs he led,\r\n  And louder he said, \"Ho! pass the red!\"\r\n  Till he went to bed with a ring in his head\r\n       That seemed like gold a-chinking.\r\n\r\n  'Twere wrong to infer from what you're read\r\n  That Richard awoke with an aching head;\r\n       For nerves like his resisted\r\n  With wonderful ease what we might deem\r\n  Enough to stagger a Polypheme,\r\n  And his spirits would never more than seem\r\n       A trifle too much \"assisted.\"\r\n\r\n  And yet in the morn no fumes were there,\r\n  And his eyes were bright,--almost as a pair\r\n       Of eyes that you and I know;\r\n  For his head, the best authorities write,\r\n  (See the Story of Tuck,) was always right\r\n  And sound as ever after a night\r\n       Of _\"Pellite curas vino!\"_\r\n\r\n  As soon as the light broke into his tent,\r\n  Without delay for a herald he sent,\r\n       And bade him don his tabard,\r\n  And away to the Count to say, \"By law\r\n  _That gold_ was the king's: unless he saw\r\n  The same ere noon, his sword he would draw\r\n       And throw away the scabbard.\"\r\n\r\n  An hour, for his morning exercise,\r\n  He swayed that sword of wondrous size,--\r\n       'Twas called his great \"persuader\";\r\n  Then a mace of steel he smote in two,--\r\n  A feat which the king would often do,\r\n  Since Saladin wondered at that _coup_\r\n       When he met our stout crusader.\r\n\r\n  A trifle for him: he \"trained to light,\"--\r\n  Grown lazy now: but his appetite,\r\n       On the whole, was satisfactory,--\r\n  As the vanishing viands, warm and cold,\r\n  Most amply proved, ere, minus the gold,\r\n  The herald returned and trembling told\r\n       How the Count had proved refractory:\r\n\r\n  Had owned it true that his serfs had found\r\n  A treasure buried somewhere in the ground,--\r\n       Perhaps not strictly a nugget:\r\n  Though none but Norman lawyers chose\r\n  To count it tort, if the finders \"froze\"\r\n  To treasure-trove,--especially those\r\n       Who held the land where they dug it,--\r\n\r\n  For quits he'd give up half,--down,--cash;\r\n  And that, for one who had gone to smash,\r\n       Was a liberal restitution:\r\n  His neighbor Shent-per-Shent did sue\r\n  On a better claim, and put it through,--\r\n  Recovered his suit, but not a _sou_\r\n       At the tail of an execution.\r\n\r\n  Coeur gazed around with the ominous glare\r\n  Of the lion deprived of the lion's share,--\r\n       A look there was no mistaking,--\r\n  A look which the courtiers never saw\r\n  Without a sudden desire to draw\r\n  Away from the sweep of the lion's paw\r\n       Before their bones were aching.\r\n\r\n  He caught the herald,--'twas by the slack\r\n  Of garments below and behind his back,--\r\n       Then twirled him round for a minute;\r\n  And when at last he let him free,\r\n  He shied him at a neighboring tree,\r\n  A distance of thirty yards and three,\r\n       And lodged him handsomely in it:\r\n\r\n  Then seized his ponderous battle-axe,\r\n  And bade his followers mount their hacks,\r\n       With a look on his countenance _so_ stern,\r\n  So little of fun, so full of fight,\r\n  That, when he came in the Count's full sight,\r\n  In something of haste and more of fright,\r\n       The Count rode out of the postern;\r\n\r\n  And crowding leagues from his angry liege,\r\n  He left his castle to storm or siege,--\r\n       His poor beef-eaters to hold out,\r\n  Or save themselves as well as they could,\r\n  Or be food for crows: what noble should\r\n  Waste thought on such? As a noble would,\r\n       He prudently smuggled the gold out.\r\n\r\n  In the feudal days, in the good old times\r\n  Of feudal virtues and feudal crimes,\r\n      A point of honor they'd make in it,\r\n  Though sure in the end their flag must fall,\r\n  To show stout fight and never to call\r\n  A truce till they saw a hole in the wall\r\n      Or a larder without any steak in it.\r\n\r\n  The fight began. Shouts filled the air,--\r\n  \"St. George!\" \"St. Denis!\"--as here and there\r\n       The shock of the battle shifted;\r\n  There were catapult-shots and shots by hand,\r\n  Ladders with desperate climbers manned,\r\n  Rams and rocks, hot lead, and sand\r\n       On the heads of the climbers sifted.\r\n\r\n  But the sturdy churls would not give way,\r\n  Though Richard in person rushed to the fray\r\n       With all of his rash proclivity\r\n  For knocks; till, despairing of knightly fame\r\n  In doughty deeds for a doubtful claim,\r\n  The hero of Jaffa changed his game\r\n       To a masterly inactivity.\r\n\r\n  He stretched his lines in a circle round,\r\n  And pitched his tent on a rising ground\r\n       For general supervision\r\n  Of both the hostile camps, while he\r\n  Could join with Blondel in minstrel glee,\r\n  Or drink, or dice with Marcadee,\r\n       And _they_--consume provision.\r\n\r\n  To starve a garrison day by day\r\n  You may not think a chivalrous way\r\n       To take a fortification.\r\n  The story is dull: by way of relief,\r\n  I make a digression, very brief,\r\n  And leave the \"ins\" to swallow their beef,\r\n       The \"outs\" their mortification.\r\n\r\n  Many there were in Richard's train\r\n    More known to fame and of higher degree,\r\n  But none that suited his fickle vein\r\n    So well as Blondel and Marcadee.\r\n  Blondel had grown from a minstrel-boy\r\n    To a very romantic troubadour\r\n  Whose soul was music, whose song was joy,\r\n    Whose only motto was _Vive l'amour!_\r\n  In lady's bower, in lordly hall,\r\n    From the king himself to the poorest clown,\r\n  A joyous welcome he had from all,\r\n    And Care in his presence forgot to frown.\r\n  Sadly romantic, fantastic and vain,\r\n    His heart for his head still made amends;\r\n  For he never sang a malicious strain.\r\n    And never was known to fail his friends.\r\n  Who but he, when the captive king,\r\n    By a brother betrayed, was left to rot,\r\n  Would have gone disguised to seek and sing,\r\n    Till he heard his tale and the tidings brought?\r\n  Little the listening sentries dreamed,\r\n    As they watched the king and a minstrel play,\r\n  That what but an idle rhyming seemed\r\n    Would rouse all England another day!\r\n  'Twas the timely aid of a friend in need,\r\n    And, seldom as Richard felt the power\r\n  Of a service past, he remembered the deed\r\n    And cherished him ever from that hour:\r\nHe made him his bard, with nought to do\r\n    But court the ladies and court the Nine,\r\n  And every day bring something new\r\n    To sing for the revellers over their wine;\r\n  With once a year a pipe of Sherry,\r\n    A suit of clothes, and a haunch of venison,\r\n  To make himself and his fellows merry,--\r\n    The salary now of Alfred Tennyson.\r\n\r\n  Marcadee was a stout Brabançon,\r\n  With conscience weak and muscles strong,\r\n  Who roamed about from clime to clime,\r\n  The side of virtue or yet of crime\r\n  Ready to take in a regular way\r\n  For any leader and regular pay;\r\n  Who trusted steel, and thought it odd\r\n  To fear the Devil or honor God.\r\n  His _forte_ was not in the field alone,\r\n    He was no common fighter,\r\n  For in all accomplishments he shone,--\r\n    At least, in all the lighter.\r\n  To lance or lute alike _au fait_,\r\n    With grasp now firm, now light,\r\n  He flourished this to knightly lay,\r\n    And that to lay a knight.\r\n  Ready in fashion to lead the _ton_,\r\n    In the battle-field his men,\r\n  He danced like a Zephyr, and, harness on,\r\n    Could walk his mile in ten.\r\n  And Nature gave him such a frame,\r\n    His tailor such a fit,\r\n  That, whether a head or a heart his aim,\r\n    He always made a hit.\r\n  Wherever he went, the ladies dear\r\n    Would very soon adore him,\r\n  And, quite of course, the lords would sneer,--\r\n    But never sneer before him!\r\n  Perhaps it fared with the ladies worse\r\n    Than it fared with their gallants;\r\n  For he broke a vow with as slight remorse\r\n    As he ever broke a lance.\r\n  Thus, tilting here and jilting there,\r\n  He fought a foe or he fooled a fair,\r\n    But little recking how;\r\n  So deadly smooth, so cruel and vain,\r\n  He might have made a capital Cain,\r\n    Or a splendid dandy now.\r\n  In short, if you looked o'er land and sea,\r\n    From London to the Niger,\r\n  You certainly must have said with me,--\r\n  If Richard was lion, Marcadee\r\n    Might well have been the tiger.\r\n\r\n  A month went by. They lay there still,\r\n  And chafed with nothing but time to kill,--\r\n  A tough old foe. Observe the way\r\n  They laid him out, as thus:--One day,--\r\n    'Twas after dinner and afternoon,\r\n  When the noise was over of knife and fork,\r\n  And only was heard an occasional cork\r\n    And Blondel idly thrumming a tune,--\r\n  King Richard pushed the wine along,\r\n  And rapped the table, and cried, \"A song!\r\n  Dulness I hold a shame, a sin\r\n  Against good wine. Come, Blondel, begin!\"\r\n  Blondel coughed,--was \"half afraid,\"--\r\n  Was \"out last night on a serenade,\r\n  And caught a cold,\"--his \"voice was gone,--\r\n  And really, just now, his head\"--\"Go on!\"\r\n  He bowed, and swept the chords--\"Brrrrang\"--\r\n  With a handful of notes, and thus he sang:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BLONDEL.\r\n\r\n  Life is fleeting,--make it pleasant;\r\n  Care for nothing but the present;\r\n  For the past we leave behind us,\r\n  And the future may not find us.\r\n    Though we cannot shun its troubles,\r\n      Care and sorrow we may banish;\r\n    Though its pleasures are but bubbles,\r\n      Catch the bubbles ere they vanish.\r\n\r\n  There is joy we cannot measure,--\r\n  Joy we may not win with treasure.\r\n  When the glance of Beauty thrills us',\r\n  When her love with rapture fills us,\r\n    Let us seize it ere it passes;\r\n      Be our motto, \"Love is mighty.\"\r\n    Fill, then, fill your brimming glasses!\r\n      Fill, and drink to Aphrodite!\r\n\r\n  Of course they drank with a right good will,\r\n  For they never missed a chance \"to fill.\"\r\n  And yet a few, I'm sorry to own,\r\n  Made side-remarks in an undertone,\r\n  Like those we hear, when, nowadays,\r\n  Good-natured friends, with seeming praise,\r\n  Contrive to damn. In the midst of the hum\r\n  They heard a loud and slashing thrum:\r\n  'Twas the king: and each his breath drew in\r\n  Till you might have heard a falling pin.\r\n  Some little excuse, at first, he made,\r\n  While over the lute his fingers strayed:--\r\n  \"You know my way,--as the fancies come,\r\n  I improvise.\"--There was ink on his thumb.\r\n  That morning, alone, good hours he spent\r\n  In writing despatches never sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  RICHARD.\r\n\r\n  There is pleasure when bright eyes are glancing\r\n      And Beauty is willing; but more\r\n  When the war-horse is gallantly prancing\r\n      And snuffing the battle afar,--\r\n  When the foe, with his banner advancing,\r\n      Is sounding the clarion of war.\r\n\r\n  Where the battle is deadly and gory,\r\n      Where foeman 'gainst foeman is pressed,\r\n  Where the path is before me to glory,\r\n      Is pleasure for me, and the best.\r\n  Let me live in proud chivalry's story,\r\n      Or die with my lance in its rest!\r\n\r\n  The plaudits followed him loud and free\r\n  As he tossed the lute to Marcadee,\r\n  Who caught it featly, bowing low,\r\n  And said, \"My liege, I may not know\r\n  To improvise; but I'll give a song,\r\n  The song of our camp,--we've known it long.\r\n  It suits not well this tinkle and thrum,\r\n  But needs to be heard with a rattling drum.\r\n  Ho, there! Tambour!--He knows it well,--\r\n  'The Brabançon!'--Now make it tell;\r\n  Let your elbows now with a spirit wag\r\n  In the outside roll and the double drag.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  MARCADEE.\r\n\r\n  I'm but a soldier of fortune, you see:\r\n                      Huzza!\r\n  Glory and love,--they are nothing to me:\r\n                      Ha, ha!\r\n  Glory's soon faded, and love is soon cold:\r\n  Give me the solid, reliable gold:\r\n                      Hurrah for the gold!\r\n\r\n  Country or king I have none, I am free:\r\n                      Huzza!\r\n  Patriot's quarrel,--'tis harvest for me:\r\n                      Ha, ha!\r\n  A soldier of fortune, my creed is soon told,--\r\n  I'd fight for the Devil, to pocket his gold:\r\n                      Hurrah for the gold!\r\n\r\n  He turned to the king, as he finished the verse,\r\n  And threw on the table a heavy purse\r\n  With a pair of dice; another, I trow,\r\n  Still lurked _incog._ for a lucky throw:--\r\n  \"'Tis mine; 'twas thine. If the king would play,\r\n  Perchance he'd find his revenge to-day.\r\n  Gambling, I own, is a fault, a sin;\r\n  I always repent--unless I win.\"\r\n  _Le jeu est fait._--\"Well thrown! eleven!\r\n  My purse is gone.--Double-six, by heaven!\"\r\n\r\n  At this unlucky point in the game\r\n  A herald was ushered in. He came\r\n  With a flag of truce, commissioned to say\r\n  The garrison now were willing to lay\r\n  The keys of the castle at his feet,\r\n  If he'd let them go and let them eat:\r\n  They'd done their best; could do no more\r\n  Than humbly wait the fortune of war\r\n  And Richard's word. It came in tones\r\n  That grated harshly:--\"D--n the bones\r\n  And double-six! Marcadee, you've won.--\r\n  Take back my word to each mother's son,\r\n      And tell them Richard swore it:\r\n  Be the smoke of their den their funeral pall!\r\n  By the Holy Tomb, I'll hang them all!\r\n  They've hung out so well behind their wall,\r\n      They'll hang out well before it.\"\r\n  Then Richard laughed in his hearty way,\r\n  Enjoying his joke, as a monarch may;\r\n  He laughed till he ached for want of breath:\r\n  If it lacked in life, it was full of death:\r\n  Like many, believing the next best thing\r\n  To a joke with a point is a joke with a sting.\r\n  Loud he laughed; but he laughed not long\r\n  Ere he leaped to the back of his charger strong,\r\n  And bounded forward, axe on high,\r\n  Circling the tents with his battle-cry,--\r\n  \"Away! away! we shall win the day:\r\n      In the front of the fight you'll find me:\r\n  The first to get in my spurs shall win,--\r\n      My boots to the wight behind me!\"\r\n\r\n  * * * They have reached the moat;\r\n  The draw is up, but a wooden float\r\n  Is thrust across, and onward they run;\r\n  The bank is gained and the barbican won;\r\n  The outer gate goes down with a crash;\r\n  Through the portcullis they madly dash,\r\n  And with shouts of triumph they now assail\r\n  The innermost gate. The crushing hail\r\n  Of rocks and beams goes through the mass,\r\n  Like the summer-hail on the summer-grass;--\r\n  They falter, they waver. A stalwart form\r\n  Breaks through the ranks, like a bolt in the storm:\r\n  'Tis the Lion King!--\"How, now, ye knaves!\r\n  Do ye look for safety? Find your graves!\"--\r\n  One blow to the left, one blow to the right,--\r\n  Two recreants fall;--no more of flight.\r\n  One stride to the front, and, stroke on stroke,\r\n  His curtle-axe rends the double oak.\r\n  Down shower the missiles;--they fall in vain;\r\n  They scatter like drops from the lion's mane.\r\n  He is down,--he is up;--that right arm! how\r\n  'Tis nerved with the strength of twenty, now!\r\n  The barrier yields,--it shivers,--it falls.\r\n  \"Huzza! Saint George! to the walls! to the walls!\r\n  Throw the rate to the moat! cut down! spare not!\r\n  No quarter! remember----_Je--su!_ I'm shot!\"\r\n\r\n  On a silken pallet lying, under hangings stiff with gold,\r\n  Now is Coeur-de-Lion sighing, weakly sighing, he the bold!\r\n  For with riches, power, and glory now forever he must part.\r\n  They have told him he is dying. Keen remorse is at his heart\r\n  Life is grateful, life is glorious, with the pulses bounding high\r\n  In a warrior frame victorious: it were easy so to die.\r\n  Yet to die is fearful ever; oh, how fearful, when the sum\r\n  Of the past is lengthened murder,--and a fearful world to come!\r\n  Where are now the wretched victims of his wrath? The deed is done.\r\n  He has conquered. They have suffered. Yonder, blackening in the sun,\r\n  From the battlements they're hanging. Little joy it gives to him\r\n  Now to see the work of vengeance, when his eye is growing dim!\r\n  One was saved,--the daring bowman who the fatal arrow sped;\r\n  He was saved, but not for mercy; better numbered with the dead!\r\n  Now, relenting, late repenting, Richard turns to Marcadee,\r\n  Saying, \"Haste, before I waver, bring the captive youth to me.\"\r\n  He is brought, his feet in fetters, heavy shackles on his hands,\r\n  And, with eye unflinching, gazing on the king, erect he stands.\r\n  He is gazing not in anger, not for insult, not for show;\r\n  But his soul, before its leaving, Richard's very soul would know.\r\n  Death is certain,--death by torture: death for him can have no sting,\r\n  If that arrow did its duty,--if he share it with the king.\r\n  Were he trembling or defiant, were he less or more than bold,\r\n  Once again to vengeful fury would he rouse the fiend of old\r\n  That in Richard's breast is lurking, ready once again to spring.\r\n  Dreading now that vengeful spirit, with a wavering voice, the king\r\n  Questions impotently, wildly: \"Prisoner, tell me, what of ill\r\n  Ever I have done to thee or thine, that me thou wouldest kill?\"\r\n  Higher, prouder still he bears him; o'er his countenance appear,\r\n  Flitting quickly, looks of wonder and of scorn: what does he hear?\r\n\r\n  \"And dost thou ask me, man of blood, what evil thou hast done?\r\n  Hast thou so soon forgot thy vow to hang each mother's son?\r\n  No! oft as thou hast broken vows, I know them to be strong,\r\n  Whene'er thy pride or lust or hate has sworn to do a wrong.\r\n  But churls should bow to right divine of kings, for good or ill,\r\n  And bare their necks to axe or rope, if 'twere thy royal will?\r\n  Ah, hadst thou, Richard, yet to learn the very meanest thing\r\n  That crawls the earth in self-defence would turn upon a king?\r\n  Yet deem not 'twas the hope of life which led me to the deed:\r\n  I'd freely lose a thousand lives to make thee, tyrant, bleed!--\r\n  Ay! mark me well, canst thou not see somewhat of old Bertrand?\r\n  My father good! my brothers dear!--all murdered by thy hand!\r\n  Yes, one escaped; he saw thee strike, he saw his kindred die,\r\n  And breathed a vow, a burning vow of vengeance;--it was I!\r\n  I've lived; but all my life has been a memory of the slain;\r\n  I've lived but to revenge them,--and I have not lived in vain!\r\n  I read it in thy haggard face, the hour is drawing nigh\r\n  When power and wealth can aid thee not,--when, Richard, thou must DIE!\r\n  What mean those pale, convulsive lips? What means that shrinking brow?\r\n  Ha! Richard of the lion-heart, thou art a coward now!\r\n  Now call thy hireling ruffians; bid them bring the cord and rack,\r\n  And bid them strain these limbs of mine until the sinews crack;\r\n  And bid them tear the quivering flesh, break one by one each bone;--\r\n  Thou canst not break my spirit, though thou mayst compel a groan.\r\n  I die, as I would live and die, the ever bold and free;\r\n  And I shall die with joy, to think I've rid the world of thee.\"\r\n\r\n  Swords are starting from their scabbards, grim and hardened warriors wait\r\n  Richard's slightest word or gesture that may seal the bowman's fate.\r\n  But his memory has been busy with the deeds of other times.\r\n  In the eyes of wakened conscience all his glories turn to crimes,\r\n  And his crimes to something monstrous; worlds were little now to give\r\n  In atonement for the least. He cries, in anguish, \"Let him live.\r\n  He has reason; never treason more became a traitor bold.\r\n  Youth, forgive as I forgive thee! Give him freedom,--give him gold.\r\n  Marcadee, be sure, obey me; 'tis the last, the dying hest\r\n  Of a monarch who is sinking, sinking fast,--oh, not to rest!\r\n  Haply, He above, remembering, may relieve my dark despair\r\n  With a ray of hope to light the gloom when I am suffering--there!\"\r\n\r\n  The captain neared the royal bed\r\n  And humbly bowed his helmèd head,\r\n  And laid his hand upon the plate\r\n  That sheathed his breast, and said, \"Though late\r\n  Thy mercy comes, I hold it still\r\n  My duty to do thy royal will.\r\n  If I should fail to serve thee fair,\r\n  May I be doomed to suffer--there!\"\r\n\r\n  I've often met with a fast young friend\r\n  More ready to borrow than I to lend;\r\n  I've heard smooth men in election-time\r\n  Prove every creed, but their own, a crime:\r\n  Perhaps, if the fast one wished to borrow,\r\n  I've taken his word to pay \"to-morrow\";\r\n  Perhaps, while Smooth explained his creed,\r\n  I've thought him the man for the country's need;\r\n  Perhaps I'm more of a trusting mood\r\n  Than you suppose; but I think I would\r\n      Have trusted that man of mail,\r\n  If I had been the dying king,\r\n  About as far as you could sling\r\n      An elephant by the tail!\r\n\r\n  Good subjects then, as now, no doubt,\r\n  When a king was dead, were eager to shout\r\n      In time, \"God save\" the new one!\r\n  One trouble was always whom to choose\r\n  Amongst the heirs; for it raised the deuse\r\n  And ran the subject's neck in a noose,\r\n      Unless he chose the true one.\r\n\r\n  Another difficult task,--to judge\r\n  If the coming king would bear a grudge\r\n      For some old breach of concord,\r\n  And take the earliest chance to send\r\n  A trusty line by a trusty friend\r\n  To give his compliments at the end\r\n      Of a disagreeable strong cord.\r\n\r\n  And whoever would have must seize his own.\r\n  Thus a dying king was left alone,\r\n      With a sad neglect of manners;\r\n  Ere his breath was out, the courtiers ran,\r\n  With fear or zeal for \"the coming man,\"\r\n  In time to escape from under his ban,\r\n      Or hurry under his banners.\r\n\r\n  So Richard was left in a shabby way\r\n  To Marcadee, with an abbot to pray\r\n      And pother with \"consolation,\"\r\n  Reminding 'twas never too late to search\r\n  For mercy, and hinting that Mother Church\r\n  Was never known to leave in the lurch\r\n      A king with a fat donation.\r\n  But the abbot was known to Richard well,\r\n  As one who would smoothen the road to hell,\r\n      And quite as willing to revel\r\n  As preach; and he always preached to \"soothe,\"\r\n  With a mild regard for \"the follies of youth,\"--\r\n  Himself, in epitome, proving the truth\r\n      Of the world, the flesh, and the Devil.\r\n\r\n  This was the will that Richard made:--\r\n  \"My body at father's feet be laid;\r\n      And to Rouen (it loved me most)\r\n  My heart I give; and I give my ins-\r\n  Ides to the rascally Poitevins;\r\n  To the abbot I give my darling--sins;\r\n      And I give \"--He gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\n  The abbot looked grave, but never spoke.\r\n  The captain laughed, gave the abbot a poke,\r\n      And, without ado or lingering,\r\n  \"Conveyed\" the personals, jewels, and gold,\r\n  Omitting the formal To Have and to Hold\r\n  From the royal finger, before it was cold,\r\n      He slipped the royal finger-ring.\r\n\r\n  There might have been in the eye of the law\r\n  A something which lawyers would call a flaw\r\n      Of title in such a conversion:\r\n  But if weak in the law, he was strong in the hand,\r\n  And had the \"nine points.\"--He summoned his band,\r\n  And ordered before him the archer Bertrand,\r\n      Intending a little diversion.\r\n\r\n  He called the cutter,--no cutter of clothes,\r\n  But such as royalty kept for those\r\n      Who happened to need correcting,--\r\n  And told him that Richard, before he died,\r\n  Desired to have a scalpel applied\r\n  To the traitor there. With professional pride,\r\n      The cutter began dissecting.\r\n\r\n  Now Bones was born with a genius to flay:\r\n  He might have ranked, had he lived to-day,\r\n      As a capital taxidermist:\r\n  And yet, as he tugged, they heard him say,\r\n  Of all the backs that ever lay\r\n  Before him in a professional way,\r\n      That was of all backs the firmest.\r\n\r\n  Kind reader, allow me to drop a veil\r\n  In pity; I cannot pursue the tale\r\n      In the heartless tone of the last strophe.\r\n  'Tis done, and again I'll be the same.\r\n  They triumphed not, if they felt no shame:\r\n  No muscle quivered, no murmur came,\r\n      Until the final catastrophe.\r\n\r\n  The captain jested a moment, then\r\n  He waved his hand and bowed to his men\r\n      With a single word, \"Disbanded,\"\r\n  And galloped away with three or four\r\n  Stout men-at-arms to the nearest shore,\r\n  Where a gallant array not long before\r\n      With the king in pride had landed.\r\n\r\n  He coasted around, went up the Rhine,\r\n  So famous then for robbers and wine,\r\n      So famous now as a ramble.\r\n  The wine and the robbers still are there;\r\n      But they rob you now with a bill of fare,\r\n  And gentlemen bankers \"on the square\"\r\n      Will clean you out, if you gamble.\r\n\r\n  He built him a Schloss on--something-Stein,\r\n  And became the first of as proud a line\r\n      As e'er took toll on the river,\r\n  When barons, perched in their castles high,\r\n  On the valley would keep a watchful eye,\r\n  And pounce on travellers with their cry,\r\n      \"The Rhine-dues! down! deliver!\"\r\n\r\n  And crack their crowns for any delay\r\n  In paying down. And that, by the way,\r\n      About as correctly as I know,\r\n  Is the origin true of an ancient phrase\r\n  So frequently heard in modern days,\r\n  When a gentleman quite reluctantly pays,--\r\n      I mean, \"To come down with the rhino.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGEND OF MARYLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AN OWRE TRUE TALE.\"\r\n\r\nThe framework of modern history is, for the most part, constructed\r\nout of the material supplied by national transactions described in\r\nofficial documents and contemporaneous records. Forms of government\r\nand their organic changes, the succession of those who have\r\nadministered them, their legislation, wars, treaties, and the\r\nstatistics demonstrating their growth or decline,--these are the\r\nelements that furnish the outlines of history. They are the dry\r\ntimbers of a vast old edifice; they impose a dry study upon the\r\nantiquary, and are still more dry to his reader.\r\n\r\nBut that which makes history the richest of philosophies and the most\r\ngenial pursuit of humanity is the spirit that is breathed into it by\r\nthe thoughts and feelings of former generations, interpreted in\r\nactions and incidents that disclose the passions, motives, and\r\nambition of men, and open to us a view of the actual life of our\r\nforefathers. When we can contemplate the people of a past age\r\nemployed in their own occupations, observe their habits and manners,\r\ncomprehend their policy and their methods of pursuing it, our\r\nimagination is quick to clothe them with the flesh and blood of human\r\nbrotherhood and to bring them into full sympathy with our individual\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nHistory then becomes a world of living figures,--a theatre that\r\npresents to us a majestic drama, varied by alternate scenes of the\r\ngrandest achievements and the most touching episodes of human\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn the composing of this drama the author has need to seek his\r\nmaterial in many a tangled thicket as well as in many an open field.\r\nFacts accidentally encountered, which singly have but little\r\nperceptible significance, are sometimes strangely discovered to\r\nillustrate incidents long obscured and incapable of explanation. They\r\nare like the lost links of a chain, which, being found, supply the\r\nmeans of giving cohesion and completeness to the heretofore useless\r\nfragments. The scholar's experience is full of these reunions of\r\nillustrative incidents gathered from regions far apart in space, and\r\noften in time. The historian's skill is challenged to its highest\r\ntask in the effort to draw together those tissues of personal and\r\nlocal adventure which, at first without seeming or suspected\r\ndependence, prove, when brought into their proper relationship with\r\neach other, to be unerring exponents of events of highest concern.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to fall upon the course of one of these currents of\r\nadventure,--to follow a solitary rivulet of tradition, such as by\r\nchance we now and then find modestly flowing along through the\r\nobscure coverts of time, and to be able to trace its progress to the\r\nconfluence of other streams,--and finally to see it grow, by the aid\r\nof these tributaries, to the proportions of an ample river, which\r\nwaters the domain of authentic history and bears upon its bosom a\r\nclear testimony to the life and character of a people.\r\n\r\nThe following legend furnishes a striking and attractive\r\nexemplification of such a growth, in the unfolding of a romantic\r\npassage of Maryland history, of which no annalist has ever given more\r\nthan an ambiguous and meagre hint. It refers to a deed of bloodshed,\r\nof which the only trace that was not obliterated from living rumor so\r\nlong as a century ago was to be found in a vague and misty relic of\r\nan old memory of the provincial period of the State. The facts by\r\nwhich I have been enabled to bring it to the full light of an\r\nhistorical incident, it will be seen in the perusal of this\r\nnarrative, have successively, and by most curious process of\r\ndevelopment, risen into view through a series of accidental\r\ndiscoveries, which have all combined, with singular coincidence and\r\nadaptation, to furnish an unquestionable chapter of Maryland history,\r\naltogether worthy of recital for its intrinsic interest, and still\r\nmore worthy of preservation for the elements it supplies towards a\r\ncorrect estimate of the troubles which beset the career and formed\r\nthe character and manners of the forefathers of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTALBOT'S CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now many years ago,--long before I had reached manhood,--that,\r\nthrough my intimacy with a friend, then venerable for his years and\r\nmost attractive to me by his store of historical knowledge, I became\r\nacquainted with a tradition touching a strange incident that had\r\nreference to a mysterious person connected with a locality on the\r\nSusquehanna River near Havre de Grace. In that day the tradition was\r\nrepeated by a few of the oldest inhabitants who dwelt in the region.\r\nI dare say it has now entirely run out of all remembrance amongst\r\ntheir descendants, and that I am, perhaps, the only individual in the\r\nState who has preserved any traces of the facts to which I allude.\r\n\r\nThere was, until not long ago, a notable cavern at the foot of a\r\nrocky cliff about a mile below the town of Port Deposit. It was of\r\nsmall compass, yet sufficiently spacious to furnish some rude shelter\r\nagainst the weather to one who might seek refuge within its solitary\r\nchamber. It opened upon the river just where a small brook comes\r\nbrattling down the bank, along the base of a hill of some magnitude\r\nthat yet retains the stately name of Mount Ararat. The visitor of\r\nthis cavern might approach it by a boat from the river, or by a\r\nrugged path along the margin of the brook and across the ledges of\r\nthe rock. This rough shelter went by the name of Talbot's Cave down\r\nto a very recent period, and would still go by that name, if it were\r\nyet in existence. But it happened, not many years since, that Port\r\nDeposit was awakened to a sudden notion of the value of the granite\r\nof the cliff, and, as commerce is a most ruthless contemner of all\r\nromance, and never hesitates between a speculation of profit and a\r\nspeculation of history, Talbot's Cave soon began to figure\r\nconspicuously in the Price Current, and in a very little while\r\ndisappeared, like a witch from the stage, in blasts of sulphur fire\r\nand rumbling thunder, under the management of those effective\r\nscene-shifters, the quarrymen. A government contract, more potent than\r\nthe necromancy of the famed wizard Michael Scott, lifted this massive\r\nrock from its base, and, flying with it full two hundred miles,\r\nburied it fathoms below the surface of the Atlantic, at the Rip Raps,\r\nnear Hampton Roads; and thus it happens that I cannot vouch the\r\nocular proof of the Cave to certify the legend I am about to relate.\r\n\r\nThe tradition attached to this spot had nothing but a misty and\r\nspectral outline. It was indefinite in the date, uncertain as to\r\npersons, mysterious as to the event,--just such a tradition as to\r\nwhet the edge of one's curiosity and to leave it hopeless of\r\ngratification. I may relate it in a few words.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, somewhere between one and two hundred years ago,\r\nthere was a man by the name of Talbot, a kinsman of Lord Baltimore,\r\nwho had committed some crime, for which he fled and became an outlaw\r\nand was pursued by the authorities of the Province. To escape these,\r\nhe took refuge in the wilderness on the Susquehanna, where he\r\nfound this cave, and used it for concealment and defence for some\r\ntime,--how long, the tradition does not say. This region was then\r\ninhabited by a fierce tribe of Indians, who are described on Captain John\r\nSmith's map as the \"Sasquesahannocks,\" and who were friendly to the\r\noutlaw and supplied him with provisions. To these details was added\r\nanother, which threw an additional interest over the story,--that\r\nTalbot had a pair of beautiful English hawks, such as were most\r\nprized in the sport of falconry, and that these were the companions\r\nof his exile, and were trained by him to pursue and strike the wild\r\nduck that abounded, then as now, on this part of the river; and he\r\nthus found amusement to beguile his solitude, as well as sustenance\r\nin a luxurious article of food, which is yet the pride of gastronomic\r\nscience, and the envy of _bons vivants_ throughout this continent.\r\n\r\nThese hawks my aged friend had often himself seen, in his own boyish\r\ndays, sweeping round the cliffs and over the broad expanse of the\r\nSusquehanna. They were easily distinguished, he said, by the\r\nresidents of that district, by their peculiar size and plumage, being\r\nof a breed not known to our native ornithology, and both being males.\r\nFor many years, it was affirmed,--long after the outlaw had vanished\r\nfrom the scene,--these gallant old rovers of the river still pursued\r\ntheir accustomed game, a solitary pair, without kindred or\r\nacquaintance in our woods. They had survived their master,--no one\r\ncould tell how long,--but had not abandoned the haunts of his exile.\r\nThey still for many a year saw the wilderness beneath their daily\r\nflight giving place to arable fields, and learned to exchange their\r\nwary guard against the Indian's arrow for a sharper watch of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon rifle. Up to the last of their appearance the\r\ncountry-people spoke of them as Talbot's hawks.\r\n\r\nThis is a summary of the story, as it was told to me. No inquiry\r\nbrought me any addition to these morsels of narrative. Who this\r\nTalbot was,--what was his crime,--how long he lived in this cave, and\r\nat what era,--were questions upon which the oracle of my tradition\r\nwas dumb.\r\n\r\nSuch a story would naturally take hold of the fancy of a lover of\r\nromance, and kindle his zeal for an enterprise to learn something\r\nmore about it; and I may reasonably suppose that this short sketch\r\nhas already stirred the bosoms of the novel-reading portion, at\r\nleast, of my readers with a desire that I should tell them what, in\r\nmy later researches, I have found to explain this legend of the Cave.\r\nEven the outline I have given is suggestive of inferences to furnish\r\nquite a plausible chapter of history.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear, from the narrative, that Talbot was a gentleman\r\nof rank in the old Province,--for he was kinsman to the Lord\r\nProprietary; and there is one of the oldest counties of Maryland that\r\nbears the name of his family,--perhaps called so in honor of himself.\r\nThen he kept his hawks, which showed him to be a man of condition,\r\nand fond of the noble sport which figures so gracefully in the annals\r\nof Chivalry.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this hawking carries the period of the story back to the\r\ntime of one of the early Lords Baltimore; for falconry was not common\r\nin the eighteenth century: and yet the date could not have been much\r\nearlier than that century, because the hawks had been seen by old\r\npersons of the last generation somewhere about the period of our\r\nRevolution; and this bird does not live much over a hundred years. So\r\nwe fix a date not far from sixteen hundred and eighty for Talbot's\r\nsojourn on the river.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the crime for which he was outlawed could scarcely have been\r\na mean felony, perpetrated for gain, but more likely some act of\r\npassion,--a homicide, probably, provoked by a quarrel, and enacted in\r\nhot blood. This Talbot was too well conditioned for a sordid crime;\r\nand his flight to the wilderness and his abode there would seem to\r\ninfer a man of strong purpose and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, as he must have had friends and confederates on the\r\nfrontier, to aid him in his concealment, and to screen him from the\r\npursuit of the government officers, and, moreover, had made himself\r\nacceptable to the Indians, to whose power he had committed himself,\r\nwe may conclude that he possessed some winning points of character;\r\nand I therefore assume him to have been of a brave, frank, and\r\ngenerous nature, capable of attracting partisans and enlisting the\r\nsympathies and service of bold men for his personal defence.\r\n\r\nSo, with the help of a little obvious speculation, founded upon the\r\ncircumstantial evidence, we weave the network of quite a natural\r\nstory of Talbot; and our meagre tradition takes on the form, and\r\nsomething of the substance, of an intelligible incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE REVELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point I leave the hero of my narrative for a while, in order\r\nthat I may open another chapter.\r\n\r\nMany years elapsed, during which the tradition remained in this\r\nunsatisfactory state, and I had given up all hope of further\r\nelucidation of it, when an accidental discovery brought me once more\r\nupon the track of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThere was published in the city of Baltimore, in the year 1808, a\r\nbook whose title was certainly as little adapted to awaken the\r\nattention of one in quest of a picturesque legend as a treatise on\r\nAlgebra. It was called \"The Landholder's Assistant,\" and was\r\nintended, as its name imported, to assist that lucky portion of\r\nmankind who possessed the soil of Maryland in their pursuit of\r\nknowledge touching the mysteries of patents, warrants, surveys, and\r\nsuch like learning, necessary to getting land or keeping what they\r\nhad. The character and style of this book, in its exterior aspect,\r\nwere as unpromising as it's title. It was printed by Messrs. Dobbin &\r\nMurphy, on rather dark paper, in a muddy type,--such as no Mr.\r\nDobbin nor Mr. Murphy of this day would allow to bear his\r\nimprimatur,--though in 1808, I doubt not, it was considered a very\r\ncreditable piece of Baltimore typography. This unpretending volume was\r\ncompiled by Chancellor Kilty. It is a very instructive book, containing\r\nmuch curious matter, is worthy of better adornment in the form of its\r\npresentation to the world, and ought to have a title more suggestive\r\nof its antiquarian lore. I should call it \"Fossil Remains of Old\r\nMaryland Law, with Notes by an Antiquary.\"\r\n\r\nIt fell into my hands by a purchase at auction, some twenty years\r\nafter I had abandoned the Legend of the Cave and the Hawks as a\r\nhopeless quest. In running over its contents, I found that a Colonel\r\nGeorge Talbot was once the Surveyor-General of Maryland; and in two\r\nshort marginal notes (the substance of which I afterwards found in\r\nChalmers's \"Annals\") it was said that \"he was noted in the Province\r\nfor the murder committed by him on Christopher Rousby, Collector of\r\nthe Customs,\"--the second note adding that this was done on board a\r\nvessel in Patuxent River, and that Talbot \"was conveyed for trial to\r\nVirginia, from whence he made his escape; and after being retaken,\r\nand\" (as the author expresses his belief) \"tried and convicted, was\r\nfinally pardoned by King James the Second.\"\r\n\r\nThese marginal notes, though bringing no clear support to the story\r\nof the Cave, were embers, however, of some old fire not entirely\r\nextinct,--which emitted a feeble gleam upon the path of inquiry. The\r\nname of the chief actor coincided with that of the tradition; the\r\ntime, that of James the Second, conformed pretty nearly to my\r\nconjecture derived from the age of the hawks; and the nature of the\r\ncrime was what I had imagined. There was just enough in this brief\r\nrevelation to revive the desire for further investigation. But where\r\nwas the search to be made? No history that I was aware of, no sketch\r\nof our early time that I had ever seen, nothing in print was known to\r\nbe in existence that could furnish a clue to the story of the\r\nOutlaw's Cave.\r\n\r\nAnd here the matter rested again for some years. But after this\r\nlapse, chance brought me upon the highway of further development,\r\nwhich led me in due time to a strange realization of the old proverb\r\nthat \"Murder will out,\"--though, in this case, its discovery could\r\nbring no other retribution than the settlement of an historical\r\ndoubt, and give some posthumous fame to the subject of the\r\ndisclosure.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1836, I had a motive and an opportunity to make\r\na visit to the County of St. Mary's. I had been looking into the\r\nhistories of our early Maryland settlement, as they are recounted in\r\nthe pages of Bozman, Chalmers, and Grahame, and found there some\r\ninducements to persuade me to make an exploration of the whereabouts\r\nof the old city which was planted near the Potomac by our first\r\npilgrims. Through the kindness of a much valued friend, whose\r\nacquirements and taste--both highly cultivated--rendered him a most\r\neffective auxiliary in my enterprise, I was supplied with an\r\nopportunity to spend a week under the hospitable roof of Mr.\r\nCarberry, the worthy Superior of the Jesuit House of St. Inigoes on\r\nthe St. Mary's River, within a short distance of the plain of the\r\nancient city.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell and myself were invited by our host to meet him, on an\r\nappointed day, at the Church of St. Nicholas on the Patuxent, near\r\nthe landing at Town Creek, and we were to travel from there across to\r\nSt. Inigoes in his carriage,--a distance of about fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nUpon our arrival at St. Nicholas, we found a full day at our disposal\r\nto look around the neighborhood, which, being the scene of much\r\nhistorical interest in our older annals, presented a pleasant\r\ntemptation to our excursion. Our friendly guide, Mr. Carberry, took\r\nus to Drum Point, the southern headland of the Patuxent at its\r\nentrance into Chesapeake Bay. Here was, at that time, and perhaps\r\nstill is, the residence of the Carroll family, whose ancestors\r\noccupied the estate for many generations. The dwelling-house was a\r\ncomfortable wooden building of the style and character of the present\r\nday, with all the appurtenances proper to a convenient and pleasant\r\ncountry homestead. Immediately in its neighborhood--so near\r\nthat it might be said to be almost within the curtilage of the\r\ndwelling--stood an old brick ruin of what had apparently been a\r\nsubstantial mansion-house. Such a monument of the past as this, of\r\ncourse, could not escape our special attention, and, upon inquiry, we\r\nwere told that it was once, a long time ago, the family home of the\r\nRousbys, the ancestors of the present occupants of the estate; that\r\nseveral generations of this family, dating back to the early days of the\r\nProvince, had resided in it; and that when it had fallen into decay,\r\nthe modern building was erected, and the old one suffered to crumble\r\ninto the condition in which we saw it. I could easily understand and\r\nappreciate the sentiment that preserved it untouched as part and\r\nparcel in the family associations of the place, and as a relic of the\r\nolden time which no one was willing to disturb.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the name of the Rousbys, here on the Patuxent River,\r\nwas a sudden and vivid remembrancer to me of the old story of Talbot,\r\nand gave new encouragement to an almost abandoned hope of solving\r\nthis mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA GRAVEYARD AND AN EPITAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a short distance of this spot, perhaps not a mile from Drum\r\nPoint, there is a small creek which opens into the river and bears\r\nthe name of Mattapony. In early times there was a notable fort here,\r\nand connected with it a stately mansion, built by Charles Calvert,\r\nLord Baltimore, for his own occasional residence. The fort and\r\nmansion are often mentioned in the Provincial records as the place\r\nwhere the Council sometimes met to transact business; and accordingly\r\nmany public acts are dated from Mattapony.\r\n\r\nCalvert was doubtless attracted to this spot by the pleasant scenery\r\nof the headland which here looks out upon the noble water-view of the\r\nChesapeake, and by its breezy position as an agreeable refuge from\r\nthe heats of summer.\r\n\r\nOur party, therefore, determined to set out upon a search for some\r\nrelics of the mansion and fort; and as a guide in this enterprise, we\r\nengaged an old negro who seemed to have a fair claim in his own\r\nconceit to be regarded both as the Solomon and the Methuselah of the\r\nplantation. He was a wrinkled, wise-looking old fellow, with a watery\r\neye and a grizzled head, and might, perhaps, have been about eighty;\r\nbut, from his own account, he left us to infer that he was not much\r\nbehind that great patriarch of Scripture whose years are described as\r\none hundred and threescore and fifteen.\r\n\r\nFinding that he was native to the estate, and had lived here all his\r\nlife, we interrogated him with some confidence in his ability to\r\ncontribute something useful to the issue of our pursuit. Amongst all\r\nthe Solomons of this world, there is not one so consciously impressed\r\nwith the unquestionable verity of his wisdom and the intensity of his\r\nknowledge as one of these veterans of an old family-estate upon which\r\nhe has spent his life. He is always an aristocrat of the most\r\nuncompromising stamp, and has a contemptuous disdain and intolerance\r\nfor every form of democracy. Poor white people have not the slightest\r\nchance of his good opinion. The pedigree and history of his master's\r\nfamily possess an epic dignity in his imagination; and the liberty he\r\ntakes with facts concerning them amounts to a grand poetical\r\nhyperbole. He represents their wealth in past times to have amounted\r\nto something of a fabulous superfluity, and their magnificence so\r\nunbounded, that he stares at you in describing it, as if its excess\r\nastonished himself.\r\n\r\nWhen we now questioned our venerable conductor, to learn what he\r\ncould tell us of the old Proprietary Mansion, he said, in his way, he\r\n\"membered it, as if it was built only yesterday: he was fotch up so\r\nnear it, that he could see it now as if it was standing before him:\r\nif _he_ couldn't pint out where it stood, it was time for him to give\r\nup: it was a mighty grand brick house,\"--laying an emphasis on\r\n_brick_, as a special point in his notion of its grandeur; and then\r\nhe added, with all the gravity of which his very solemn visage was a\r\ncopious index, that \"Old Master Baltimore, who built it, was a real\r\nfine gentleman. He knowed him so well! He never gave anything but\r\ngold to the servants for tending on him. Bless you! he wouldn't even\r\nthink of silver! Many a time has he given me a guinea for waiting on\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of Old Master Baltimore, and his magnificent contempt of\r\nsilver, and the intimacy of our patriarch with him, rather startled\r\nus, and I began to fear that the story of the house might turn out to\r\nbe as big a lie as the acquaintance with the Lord Proprietary,--for\r\nMaster Baltimore had then been dead just one hundred and twenty-one\r\nyears. But we went on with him, and were pleasantly disappointed when\r\nhe brought us upon a hill that sloped down to the Mattapony, and\r\nthere traced out for us, by the depression of the earth, the visible\r\nlines of an old foundation of a large building, the former existence\r\nof which was further demonstrated by some scattered remains of the\r\nold imported brick of the edifice which were imbedded in the soil.\r\n\r\nThis spot had a fine outlook upon the Bay, and every advantage of\r\nlocality to recommend its choice for a domestic establishment. We\r\ncould find nothing to indicate the old fort except the commanding\r\ncharacter of the hill with reference to the river, which might\r\nwarrant a conjecture as to its position. I believe that the house was\r\nincluded within the ramparts of the fortification, as I perceive in\r\nsome of the old records that the fortification itself was called the\r\nMattapony House, which was once beleaguered and taken by Captain John\r\nCoode and Colonel Jowles.\r\n\r\nAfter we had examined all that was to be seen here, our next point of\r\ninterest was a graveyard, which, we had been informed by some of the\r\nhousehold at Mrs. Carroll's, had been preserved upon the estate from\r\na very early period. Our old gossip professed to know all about this,\r\nfrom its very first establishment. It was in another direction from\r\nthe mansion-house, about a mile distant, on the margin of an inlet\r\nfrom the Bay, called Harper's Creek; and thither we accordingly went.\r\nBefore we reached the spot, the old negro stopped at a cabin that lay\r\nin our route and provided himself with a hoe, which, borne upon his\r\nshoulder, gave a somewhat mysterious significance to the office he\r\nhad assumed. He did not explain the purpose of this equipment to us,\r\nand we forbore to question him. After descending to the level of the\r\ntide and passing through some thickets of wild shrubbery, we arrived\r\nupon a grassy plain immediately upon the border of the creek; and\r\nthere, in a quiet, sequestered nook of rural landscape, the smooth\r\nand sluggish little inlet begirt with waterlilies and reflecting wood\r\nand sky and the green hill-side upon its surface, was the chosen\r\nresting-place of the departed generations of the family. A few simple\r\ntombstones--some of them darkened by the touch of Time--lay clustered\r\nwithin an old inclosure. The brief memorials engraved upon them told\r\nus how inveterately Death had pursued his ancient vocation and\r\ngathered in his relentless tribute from young and old in times past\r\nas he does to-day.\r\n\r\nHere was a theme for a sermon from the patriarch, who now leaned upon\r\nhis hoe and shook his head with a slow ruminative motion, as if he\r\nhoped by this action to disengage from it some profound moral\r\nreflections, and then began to enumerate how many of these good\r\npeople he had helped to bury; but before he had well begun this\r\ndiscourse we had turned away and were about leaving the place, when\r\nhe recalled us by saying, \"I have got one tombstone yet to show you,\r\nas soon as I can clear it off with the hoe: it belongs to old Master\r\nRousby, who was stobbed aboard ship, and is, besides that, the\r\ngrandest tombstone here.\"\r\n\r\nHere was another of those flashes of light by which my story seemed\r\nto be preordained to a prosperous end. We eagerly encouraged the old\r\nman to this task, and he went to work in removing the green sod from\r\na large slab which had been entirely hidden under the soil, and in a\r\nbrief space revealed to us a tombstone fully six feet long, upon\r\nwhich we were able to read, in plainly chiselled letters, an\r\ninscription surmounted by a carved heraldic shield with its proper\r\nquarterings and devices.\r\n\r\nOur group at this moment would have made a fine artistic study. There\r\nwas this quiet landscape around us garnished with the beauty of May;\r\nthere were the rustic tombs,--the old negro, with a countenance\r\nsurcharged with the expression of solemn satisfaction at his\r\nemployment, bending his aged figure over the broad, carved stone, and\r\nscraping from it the grass which had not been disturbed perhaps for a\r\nquarter of a century; and there was our own party looking on with\r\neager interest, as the inscription every moment became more legible.\r\nThat interest may be imagined, on reading the inscription, which,\r\nwhen brought to the full light of day, revealed these words:--\r\n\r\n\"Here lyeth the body of Xph'r Rousbie Esquire, who was taken out of\r\nthis world by a violent death received on board his Majesty's ship\r\nThe Quaker Ketch, Capt. Tho's. Allen Commander, the last day of\r\nOctober 1684. And also of Mr. John Rousbie, his brother, who departed\r\nthis naturall life on board the Ship Baltimore, being arrived in\r\nPatuxen the first day of February 1685.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a picturesque incident in its scenic character, but a still\r\nmore engaging one as an occurrence in the path of discovery. Here was\r\nmost unexpectedly brought to view a new link in the chain of our\r\nstory. It was a pleasant surprise to have such a fact as this\r\nbreaking upon us from an ambuscade, to help out a half-formed\r\nnarrative which I had feared was hopeless of completion. The\r\ninscription is a necessary supplement to the marginal notes. As an\r\ninsulated monument, it is meagre in its detail, and stands in need of\r\nexplanation. It does not describe Christopher Rousby as the Collector\r\nof the Customs; it does not affirm that he was murdered; it makes no\r\nallusion to Talbot: but it gives the name of the ship and its\r\ncommander, along with the date of the death. \"The Landholder's\r\nAssistant\" supplies all the facts that are wanting in this brief\r\nstatement. These two memorials help each other and enlarge the common\r\ncurrent of testimony, like two confluent streams coming from opposite\r\nsources. From the two together we learn, that Colonel Talbot, the\r\nSurveyor-General in 1684, killed Mr. Christopher Rousby on board of a\r\nship of war; and we are apprised that Rousby was a gentleman of rank\r\nand authority in the Province, holding an important commission from\r\nthe King. The place at which the tomb is found shows also that he was\r\nthe owner of a considerable landed estate and a near neighbor of the\r\nLord Proprietary.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, requires much more circumstance to give it the\r\ninterest which we hope yet to find in it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDRYASDUST.\r\n\r\nI have now to change my scene, and to pursue in another quarter more\r\nimportant investigations. I break off with some regret from my visit\r\nto St. Mary's, because it had many attractions of its own, which\r\nwould form a pleasant theme for description. Some of the results of\r\nthat visit I embodied, several years ago, in a fiction which I fear\r\nthe world will hardly credit me in saying has as much history in it\r\nas invention. [Footnote: _Rob of the Bowl._] But my journey had no\r\nfurther connection with the particular subject before us, after the\r\ndiscovery of the tomb. I therefore take my leave, at this juncture,\r\nof good Father Carberry and St. Inigoes, and also of my companion in\r\nthis adventure,--pausing but a moment to say, that the Superior of\r\nSt. Inigoes has, some time since, gone to his account, and that I am\r\nnot willing to part with him in my narrative without a grateful\r\nrecognition of the esteem I have for his memory, in which I share\r\nwith all who were acquainted with him,--an esteem won by the simple,\r\nunostentatious merit of his character, his liberal religious\r\nsentiment, and his frank and cordial hospitality, which had the best\r\nflavor of the good old housekeeping of St. Mary's,--a commendation\r\nwhich every one conversant with that section of Maryland will\r\nunderstand to imply what the Irish schoolmaster, in one of Carleton's\r\ntales, calls \"the hoighth of good living.\"\r\n\r\nAfter my return from this excursion, I resolved to make a search\r\namongst the records at Annapolis, to ascertain whether any memorials\r\nexisted which might furnish further information in regard to the\r\nevents to which I had now got a clue. And here comes in a morsel of\r\nofficial history which will excuse a short digression.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature had, about this time, directed the Executive to cause\r\na search through the government buildings, with a view to the\r\ndiscovery of old state papers and manuscripts, which, having been\r\nconsigned, time out of mind, to neglect and oblivion, were known only\r\nas heaps of promiscuous lumber, strewed over the floors of damp\r\ncellars and unfrequented garrets. The careless and unappreciative\r\nspirit of the proper guardians of our archives in past years had\r\nsuffered many precious folios and separate papers to be disposed of\r\nas mere rubbish; and the not less culpable and incurious indolence of\r\ntheir successors, in our own times, had treated them with equal\r\nindifference. The attention of the Legislature was awakened to the\r\nimportance of this investigation by Mr. David Ridgely, the State\r\nLibrarian, and he was appointed by the Executive to undertake the\r\nlabor. Never did beagle pursue the chase with more steady foot than\r\ndid this eager and laudable champion of the ancient fame of the State\r\nhis chosen duty. He rummaged old cuddies, closets, vaults, and\r\ncocklofts, and pried into every recess of the Chancery, the Land\r\nOffice, the Committee-Rooms, and the Council-Chamber, searching\r\nup-stairs and down-stairs, wherever a truant paper was supposed to lurk.\r\nGroping with lantern in hand and body bent, he made his way through\r\nnarrow passages, startling the rats from their fastnesses, where they\r\nhad been intrenched for half a century, and breaking down the thick\r\ndrapery--the Gobelin tapestry I might call it--woven by successive\r\nfamilies of spiders from the days of the last Lord Proprietary. The\r\nvery dust which was kicked up in Annapolis, as the old newspapers\r\ntell us, at the passage of the Stamp Act, was once more set in motion\r\nby the foot of this resolute and unwearied invader, and everywhere\r\nsomething was found to reward the toil of the search. But the most\r\nvaluable discoveries were made in the old Treasury,--made, alas! too\r\nlate for the full fruition of the Librarian's labor. The Treasury,\r\none of the most venerable structures in the State, is that lowly and\r\nquaint little edifice of brick which the visitor never fails to\r\nnotice within the inclosure of the State-House grounds. It was\r\noriginally designed for the accommodation of the Governor and his\r\nCouncil, and for the sessions of the Upper House of the Provincial\r\nLegislature; the Burgesses, at that time, holding their meetings in\r\nthe old State House, which occupied the site of the present more\r\nimposing and capacious building: this latter having been erected\r\nabout the year 1772.\r\n\r\nIn some dark recess of the Treasury Office Mr. Ridgely struck upon a\r\nmine of wealth, in a mouldy wooden box, which was found to contain\r\nmany missing Journals of the Provincial Council, some of which bore\r\ndate as far back as 1666. It was a sad disappointment to him, when\r\nhis eye was greeted with the sight of these folios, to see them\r\ncrumble, like the famed Dead-Sea Apples, into powder, upon every\r\nattempt, to handle them. The form of the books was preserved and the\r\ncharacter of the writing distinctly legible, but, from the effect of\r\nmoisture, the paper had lost its cohesion, and fell to pieces at\r\nevery effort to turn a leaf. I was myself a witness to this\r\ntantalizing deception, and, with the Librarian, read enough to show\r\nthe date and character of the perishing record.\r\n\r\nThrough this accident, the Council Journals of a most interesting\r\nperiod, embracing several years between 1666 and 1692, were\r\nirretrievably lost. Others sustained less damage, and were partially\r\npreserved. Some few survived in good condition.\r\n\r\nOur Maryland historians have had frequent occasion to complain of the\r\ndeficiency of material for the illustration of several epochs in the\r\nProvincial existence, owing to the loss of official records. No\r\nresearch has supplied the means of describing the public events of\r\nthese intervals, beyond some few inferences, which are only\r\nsufficient to show that these silent periods were marked by incidents\r\nof important interest. The most striking of these privations occurs\r\ntowards the end of the seventeenth century,--precisely that period to\r\nwhich the crumbling folios had reference.\r\n\r\nThis loss of the records has been ascribed to their frequent removals\r\nduring periods of trouble, and to the havoc made in the rage of\r\nparties. The Province, like the great world from which it was so far\r\nremote, was distracted with what are sometimes called religious\r\nquarrels, but what I prefer to describe as exceedingly irreligious\r\nquarrels, carried on by men professing to be Christians, and\r\ngenerated in the heat of disputes concerning the word of the great\r\nTeacher of \"peace on earth.\" Out of these grew any quantity of\r\nrebellion and war, tinctured with their usual flavor of persecution.\r\nFor at this era the wars of Christendom were chiefly waged in support\r\nof dogmas and creeds, and took a savage hue from the fury of\r\nreligious bigotry. The wars of Europe since that period have arisen\r\nupon commercial and political questions, and religion has been freed\r\nfrom the dishonor of promoting these bloody strifes so incompatible\r\nwith its high office. In these quarrels of the fathers of Maryland,\r\nthe archives of government were seized more than once, and, perhaps,\r\ndestroyed. On one occasion they were burnt. And so, amongst all these\r\ndisorders, it has fallen out that the full development of the State\r\nhistory has been rendered impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgely's foray, however, into this domain of dust and darkness\r\nhas happily rescued much useful matter to aid the future chronicler\r\nin supplying the deficiency of past attempts to trace the path of our\r\nmodest annals through these silent intervals. Incidentally the\r\nLibrarian's work has assisted my story; for, although the recovered\r\nfolios did not touch the exact year of my search, the pursuit of them\r\nled me to what I may claim as a discovery of my own. I found what I\r\ncould not say was wholly lost, but what, until Mr. Ridgely's\r\nexploration drew attention to the records, might have been said to\r\nhave shrunk from all notice of the present generation, and to be fast\r\nfalling a prey to the tooth of time and the visit of the worm. A few\r\nyears more of neglect and the ill usage of careless custodians, and\r\nit would have passed to that depository of things lost upon the\r\nearth, which fable has placed in the moon. It was my good fortune, in\r\nthis upturning of relics of the past, to lay my hand upon a sadly\r\ntattered and decayed MS. volume,--unbound, without beginning and\r\nwithout end, coated with the dust which had been gathering upon it\r\never since Chalmers and Bozman had done their work of deciphering its\r\nquaint old text. It lay in the state of rubbish, in an old case,\r\nwhere many documents of the same kind had been consigned to the same\r\noblivion, and with it had been sleeping for as many years, perhaps,\r\nas the Beauty in the fairy tale,--happily destined, at last, to be\r\nawakened, as she was, by one who by his perseverance had won a title\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript was now, in this day of revival, brought out from its\r\nhiding-place, and, upon inspection, proved to be a Journal of the\r\nCouncil for some few years including the very date of the death of\r\nthe Collector on the Patuxent.\r\n\r\nThe record was complete, neatly written in the peculiar manuscript\r\ncharacter of that age, so difficult for a modern reader to decipher.\r\nIts queer old-fashioned spelling suggested the idea that our\r\nancestors considered both consonants and vowels too weak to stand\r\nalone, and that therefore they doubled them as often as they could;\r\nand there was such an actual identification of its antiquity in its\r\nexterior aspect as well as in its forms of speech, that, when I have\r\nsat poring over it alone at midnight in my study, as I have often\r\ndone, I have turned my eye over my shoulder, expecting to see the\r\napparition of Master John Llewellin--who subscribes his name with a\r\nvery energetic nourish as Clerk of the Council--standing behind me in\r\ngrave-colored doublet and trunk-hose, with a starched ruff, a\r\nwide-awake hat drawn over his brow, and a short black feather falling\r\namongst the locks of his dark hair towards his back.\r\n\r\nThis Journal lets in a blaze of light upon the old tradition of\r\nTalbot's Cave. The narrative of what it discloses it is now my\r\npurpose to make as brief as is compatible with common justice to my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT OF HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Calvert, Lord Baltimore, the son of Cecilius, was, according\r\nto the testimony of all our annalists, a worthy gentleman and an\r\nupright ruler. He was governor of Maryland, by the appointment of his\r\nfather, from 1662 to 1675, and after that became the Lord Proprietary\r\nby inheritance, and administered the public affairs in person. His\r\nprudence and judgment won him the esteem of the best portion of his\r\npeople, and the Province prospered in his hands.\r\n\r\nAll our histories tell of the troubles that beset the closing years\r\nof his residence in Maryland. They arose partly out of his religion,\r\nand in part out of the jealousy of the crown concerning the\r\nprivileges of his charter.\r\n\r\nHe was a Roman Catholic; but, like his father, liberal and tolerant\r\nin opinion, and free from sectarian bias in the administration of his\r\ngovernment. Apart from the influence of his father's example, the\r\ntraining of his education, his real attachment to the interests of\r\nthe Province, and his own natural inclination,--all of which pointed\r\nout to him the duty as well as the advantage of affording the utmost\r\nsecurity to the freedom of religious opinion,--the conditions under\r\nwhich he held his proprietary rights rendered a departure from this\r\npolicy the most improbable accusation that could be made against him.\r\nThe public mind of England at that period was fevered to a state of\r\nmadness by the domestic quarrel that raged within the kingdom against\r\nthe Catholics. The people were distracted with constant alarms of\r\nPopish plots for the overthrow of the government. The King, a\r\nheartless profligate, absorbed in frivolous pleasures, scarcely\r\nentertained any grave question of state affairs that had not some\r\nconnection with his hatreds and his fears of Catholics and\r\nDissenters. Then, also, the Province itself was composed, in far the\r\ngreater part, of a Protestant population,--computed by some\r\ncontemporary writers at the proportion of thirty to one,--a\r\npopulation who were guarantied freedom of conscience by the Charter,\r\nand who possessed all necessary power both legal and physical to\r\nenforce it.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances as these, how is it possible to impute\r\ndesigns against the old established toleration, which had marked the\r\nhistory of Maryland from its first settlement to that day, to so\r\nprudent and careful a ruler as Charles Calvert, without imputing to\r\nhim, at the same time, a folly so absurd as to belie every opinion\r\nthat has ever been uttered to his advantage?\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding these improbabilities, the accusation was made\r\nand affected to be believed by the King and his Council; the result\r\nof which was that a royal order was sent to the Proprietary,\r\ncommanding him to dismiss every Catholic from employment in the\r\nProvince, and to supply their places by the appointment of\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible theory upon which I can account for this harsh\r\nproceeding is suggested by the fact that parties in the Province took\r\nthe same complexion with those in the mother country and ran parallel\r\nwith them,--that the same excitements which agitated the minds of the\r\npeople in England were industriously fomented here, where no similar\r\nreason for them existed, as the volunteer work of demagogues who saw\r\nin them the means of promoting their own interest,--that, in fact,\r\nthis opposition to the Proprietary grew out of a failing in our\r\nancestors which has not yet been cured in their descendants, a\r\nweakness in favor of the loaves and fishes. The party in the majority\r\ncarried the elections, and felt, of course, as all parties do who\r\nperform such an exploit, that they had made a very gigantic sacrifice\r\nfor the good of the country and deserved to be remunerated for such\r\nan act of heroism, and thereupon set up and asserted that venerable\r\ndoctrine which has been erroneously and somewhat vaingloriously\r\nclaimed as the conception of a modern statesman, namely,--\"that to\r\nthe victors belong the spoils.\" I rejoice in the discovery that a\r\ndogma so profound and so convenient has the sanction of antiquity to\r\ncommend it to the platform of the patriots of our own time.\r\n\r\nI must in a few words notice another charge against Lord Baltimore,\r\nwhich was even more serious than the first, and to which the cupidity\r\nof the King lent a willing ear. Parliament had passed an act for\r\nlevying certain duties on the trade of the Southern Colonies, which\r\nwere very oppressive to the commerce of Maryland. These duties were\r\ngathered by Collectors specially appointed for the occasion, who held\r\ntheir commissions from the Crown, and who were stationed at the\r\nseveral ports of entry of the Province. The frequent evasion of these\r\nduties gave rise to much ill-will between the Collectors and the\r\npeople. Lord Baltimore was charged with having connived at these\r\nevasions, and with obstructing the collection of the royal revenue.\r\nHis chief accusers were the Collectors, who, being Crown officers,\r\nseemed naturally to array themselves against him. Although there was\r\nreally no foundation for this complaint, yet the King, who never\r\nthrew away a chance to replenish his purse, compelled the Proprietary\r\nto pay by way of retribution a large sum into the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nI have no need to dwell upon this subject, and have referred to it\r\nonly because it explains the relation between Lord Baltimore and\r\nChristopher Rousby, and has therefore some connection with my story.\r\nRousby was an enemy to the Proprietary; and from a letter preserved\r\nby Chalmers it appears there was no love lost between them. Lord\r\nBaltimore writes to the Earl of Anglesey, the President of the King's\r\nCouncil, in 1681,--\"I have already written twice to your Lordship\r\nabout Christopher Rousby, who I desired might be removed from his\r\nplace of Collector of his Majesty's Customs,--he having been a great\r\nknave, and a disturber of the trade and peace of the Province\"; which\r\nletter, it seems, had no effect,--as Christopher Rousby was continued\r\nin his post. He was doubtless emboldened by the failure of this\r\nremonstrance against him to exhibit his ill-will towards the\r\nProprietary in more open and more vexatious modes of annoyance.\r\n\r\nAll these embarrassments threw a heavy shadow over the latter years\r\nof Lord Baltimore's life, and now drove him to the necessity of\r\nmaking a visit to England for the purpose of personal explanation and\r\ndefence before the King. He accordingly took his departure in the\r\nmonth of June, 1684, intending to return in a few months; but a tide\r\nof misfortune that now set in upon him prevented that wish, and he\r\nnever saw Maryland again.\r\n\r\nIn about half a year after Calvert's arrival in England, King Charles\r\nthe Second was gathered to his fathers, and his brother, the Duke of\r\nYork, a worse man, a greater hypocrite, and a more crafty despot,\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nJames the Second was a Roman Catholic, and Calvert, on that score\r\nalone, might have expected some sympathy and favor: he might, at\r\nleast, have expected justice. But James was heartless and selfish.\r\nThe Proprietary found nothing but cold neglect, and a contemptible\r\njealousy of the prerogatives and power conferred by his charter.\r\nJames himself claimed to be a proprietary on this continent by virtue\r\nof extensive royal grants, and was directly interested with William\r\nPenn in defeating the claims of the Baltimore family to the country\r\nupon the Delaware; he was, therefore, in fact, the secret and\r\nprepossessed enemy of Calvert. Instead of protection from the Crown,\r\nCalvert found proceedings instituted in the King's Bench to annul his\r\ncharter, which, but for the abrupt termination of this short,\r\ndisgraceful reign in abdication and flight, would have been\r\nconsummated under James's own direction. The Revolution of 1688\r\nbrought up other influences more hostile still to the Proprietary;\r\nand the Province, which was always sedulous to follow the fashions of\r\nLondon, was not behindhand on this occasion, but made, also, its\r\nrevolution, in imitation of the great one. The end of all was the\r\nutter subversion of the Charter, and a new government of Maryland\r\nunder a royal commission. How this was accomplished our historians\r\nare not able to tell. From 1688 to 1692 is one of our dark intervals\r\nof which I have spoken. It begins with a domestic revolution and ends\r\nwith the appointment of a Royal Governor, and that is pretty nearly\r\nall we know about it. After this, there was no Proprietary dominion\r\nin Maryland, until it was restored upon the accession of George the\r\nFirst in 1715, when it reappears in the second Charles Calvert, a\r\nminor, the grandson of the late Proprietary. This gentleman was the\r\nson of Benedict Leonard Calvert, and was educated in the Protestant\r\nfaith, which his father had adopted as more consonant with the\r\nprosperity of the family and the hopes of the Province.\r\n\r\nBefore Lord Baltimore took his departure, he made all necessary\r\narrangements for the administration of the government during his\r\nabsence. The chief authority he invested in his son Benedict Leonard,\r\nto whom I referred just now,--at that time a youth of twelve or\r\nfourteen years of age. My old record contains the commission issued\r\non this occasion, which is of the most stately and royal breadth of\r\nphrase, and occupies paper enough to make a deed for the route of the\r\nPacific Railroad. In this document \"our dearly beloved son Benedict\r\nLeonard Calvert\" is ordained and appointed to be \"Lieutenant General,\r\nChief Captain, Chief Governor and Commander, Chief Admiral both by\r\nsea and land, of our Province of Maryland, and of all our Islands,\r\nTerritories, and Dominions whatsoever, and of all and singular our\r\nCastles, Forts, Fortresses, Fortifications, Munitions, Ships, and\r\nNavies in our said Province, Islands, Territories, and Dominions\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nI hope to be excused for the particularity of my quotation of this\r\nyoung gentleman's titles, which I have given at full length only by\r\nway of demonstration of the magnificence of our old Palatine Province\r\nof Maryland, and to excite in the present generation a becoming pride\r\nat having fallen heirs to such a principality; albeit Benedict\r\nLeonard's more recent successors to these princely prerogatives may\r\nhave reason to complain of that relentless spirit of democracy which\r\nhas shorn them of so many worshipful honors. But we republicans are\r\nphilosophical, and can make sacrifices with a good grace.\r\n\r\nAs it was quite impossible for this young Lieutenant General to go\r\nalone under such a staggering weight of dignities, the same\r\ncommission puts him in leading-strings by the appointment of nine\r\nDeputy or Lieutenant Governors who are charged with the execution of\r\nall his duties. The first-named of these deputies is \"our dearly\r\nbeloved Cousin,\" Colonel George Talbot, who is associated with \"our\r\nwell-beloved Counsellor,\" Thomas Tailler, Colonel Vincent Low,\r\nColonel Henry Darnall, Colonel William Digges, Colonel William\r\nStevens, Colonel William Burgess, Major Nicholas Sewall, and John\r\nDarnall, Esquire. These same gentlemen, with Edward Pye and Thomas\r\nTruman, are also commissioned to be of the Privy Council, \"for and in\r\nrelation to all matters of State.\"\r\n\r\nThese appointments being made and other matters disposed of, Charles\r\nCalvert took leave of his beautiful and favorite Maryland, never to\r\nsee this fair land again.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA BORDER CHIEFTAIN.\r\n\r\nI have now to pursue the narrative of my story as I find the\r\nnecessary material in the old Council Journal. I shall not incumber\r\nthis narrative with literal extracts from these proceedings, but give\r\nthe substance of what I find there, with such illustration as I have\r\nbeen able to glean from other sources.\r\n\r\nColonel George Talbot, whom we recognize as the first-named in the\r\ncommission of the nine Deputy Governors and of the Privy Council,\r\nseems to have been a special favorite of the Proprietary. He was the\r\ngrandson of the first Baron of Baltimore, the Secretary of State of\r\nJames the First. His father was an Irish baronet, Sir George Talbot,\r\nof Cartown in Kildare, who had married Grace, one of the younger\r\nsisters of Cecilius, the second Proprietary and father of Charles\r\nCalvert. He was, therefore, as the commission describes him, the\r\ncousin of Lord Baltimore, who had now invested him with a leading\r\nauthority in the administration of the government.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Ireland, and from some facts connected with his\r\nhistory I infer that he did not emigrate to Maryland until after his\r\nmarriage, his wife being an Irish lady.\r\n\r\nThat he was a man of consideration in the Province, with large\r\nexperience in its affairs, is shown by the character of the\r\nemployments that were intrusted to him. He had been, for some years\r\nbefore the departure of Lord Baltimore on his visit to England, a\r\nconspicuous member of his Council. He had, for an equal length of\r\ntime, held the post of Surveyor-General, an office of high\r\nresponsibility and trust. But his chief employment was of a military\r\nnature, in which his discretion, courage, and conduct were in\r\nconstant requisition. He had the chief command, with the title and\r\ncommission of Deputy Governor, over the northern border of the\r\nProvince, a region continually exposed to the inroads of the fierce\r\nand warlike tribe of the \"Sasquesahannocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe country lying between the Susquehanna and the Delaware, that\r\nwhich now coincides with parts of Harford and Cecil Counties in\r\nMaryland and the upper portion of the State of Delaware, was known in\r\nthose days as New Ireland, and was chiefly settled by emigrants from\r\nthe old kingdom whose name it bore. This region was included within\r\nthe range of Talbot's command, and was gradually increasing in\r\npopulation and in farms and houses scattered over a line of some\r\nseventy or eighty miles from east to west, and slowly encroaching\r\nupon the thick wilderness to the north, where surly savages lurked\r\nand watched the advance of the white man with jealous anger.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of this tract held their lands under the Proprietary\r\ngrants, coupled with a condition, imposed as much by their own\r\nnecessities as by the law, to render active service in the defence of\r\nthe frontier as a local militia. They were accordingly organized on a\r\nmilitary establishment, and kept in a state of continual preparation\r\nto repel the unwelcome visits of their hostile neighbors.\r\n\r\nA dispute between Lord Baltimore and William Penn, founded upon the\r\nclaim of the former to a portion of the territory bounding on the\r\nDelaware, had given occasion to border feuds, which had imposed upon\r\nour Proprietary the necessity of building and maintaining a fort on\r\nChristiana Creek, near the present city of Wilmington; and there were\r\nalso some few block-houses or smaller fortified strongholds along the\r\nline of settlement towards the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nThese forts were garrisoned by a small force of musketeers maintained\r\nby the government. The Province was also at the charge of a regiment\r\nof cavalry, of which Talbot was the Colonel, and parts of which were\r\nassigned to the defence of this frontier.\r\n\r\nIf we add to these a corps of rangers, who were specially employed in\r\nwatching and arresting all trespassers upon the territory of the\r\nProvince, it will complete our sketch of the military organization of\r\nthe frontier over which Talbot had the chief command. The whole or\r\nany portion of this force could be assembled in a few hours to meet\r\nthe emergencies of the time. Signals were established for the muster\r\nof the border. Beacon fires on the hills, the blowing of horns, and\r\nthe despatch of runners were familiar to the tenants, and often called\r\nthe ploughman away from the furrow to the appointed gathering-place.\r\nThree musket-shots fired in succession from a lonely cabin, at\r\ndead of night, awakened the sleeper in the next homestead; the three\r\nshots, repeated from house to house, across this silent waste of\r\nforest and field, carried the alarm onward; and before break of day a\r\nhundred stout yeomen, armed with cutlass and carbine, were on foot to\r\ncheck and punish the stealthy foray of the Sasquesahannock against\r\nthe barred and bolted dwellings where mothers rocked their children\r\nto sleep, confident in the protection of this organized and effective\r\nsystem of defence.\r\n\r\nIn this region Talbot himself held a manor which was called New\r\nConnaught, and here he had his family mansion, and kept hospitality\r\nin rude woodland state, as a man of rank and command, with his\r\nretainers and friends gathered around him. This establishment was\r\nseated on Elk River, and was, doubtless, a fortified position. I\r\npicture to my mind a capacious dwelling-house built of logs from the\r\nsurrounding forest; its ample hall furnished with implements of war,\r\npikes, carbines, and basket-hilled swords, mingled with antlers of\r\nthe buck, skins of wild animals, plumage of birds, and other trophies\r\nof the hunter's craft; the large fireplace surrounded with hardy\r\nwoodsmen, and the tables furnished with venison, wild fowl, and fish,\r\nthe common luxuries of the region, in that prodigal profusion to\r\nwhich our forefathers were accustomed, and which their descendants\r\nstill regard as the essential condition of hearty and honest\r\nhousekeeping. This mansion I fancy surrounded by a spacious picketed\r\nrampart, presenting its bristling points to the four quarters of the\r\ncompass, and accessible only through a gateway of ponderous timber\r\nstudded thick with nails: the whole offering defiance to the grim\r\nsavage who might chance to prowl within the frown of its midnight\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nHere Talbot spent the greater portion of the year with his wife and\r\nchildren. Here he had his yacht or shallop on the river, and often\r\nskimmed this beautiful expanse of water in pursuit of its abundant\r\ngame,--those hawks of which tradition preserves the memory his\r\ncompanions and auxiliaries in this pastime. Here, too, he had his\r\nhounds and other hunting-dogs to beat up the game for which the banks\r\nof Elk River are yet famous.\r\n\r\nThis sylvan lodge was cheered and refined by the presence of his wife\r\nand children, whose daily household occupations were assisted by\r\nnumerous servants chosen from the warm-hearted people who had left\r\ntheir own Green Isle to find a home in this wilderness.\r\n\r\nAmidst such scenes and the duties of her station we may suppose that\r\nMrs. Talbot, a lady who could not but have relinquished many comforts\r\nin her native land for this rude life of the forest, found sufficient\r\nresource to quell the regrets of many fond memories of the home and\r\nfriends she had left behind, and to reconcile her to the fortunes of\r\nher husband, to whom, as we shall see, she was devoted with an ardor\r\nthat no hardship or danger could abate.\r\n\r\nBeing the dispenser of her husband's hospitality,--the bread-giver,\r\nin the old Saxon phrase,--the frequent companion of his pastime, and\r\nthe bountiful friend, not only of the families whose cottages threw\r\nup their smoke within view of her dwelling, but of all who came and\r\nwent on the occasions of business or pleasure in the common\r\nintercourse of the frontier, we may conceive the sentiment of respect\r\nand attachment she inspired in this insulated district, and the\r\nservice she was thus enabled to command.\r\n\r\nThis is but a fancy picture, it is true, of the home of Talbot,\r\nwhich, for want of authentic elements of description, I am forced to\r\ndraw. It is suggested by the few scattered glimpses we get in the\r\nrecords of his position and circumstances, and may, I think, be\r\nreceived at least as near the truth in its general aspect and\r\ncharacteristic features.\r\n\r\nHe was undoubtedly a bold, enterprising man,--impetuous, passionate,\r\nand harsh, as the incidents of his story show. He was, most probably,\r\na soldier trained to the profession, and may have served abroad, as\r\nnearly all gentlemen of that period were accustomed to do. That he\r\nwas an ardent and uncompromising partisan of the Proprietary in the\r\ndissensions of the Province seems to be evident. I suppose him, also,\r\nto have been warm-hearted, proud in spirit, and hasty in temper,--a\r\nman to be loved or hated by friend or foe with equal intensity. It is\r\nmaterial to add to this sketch of him, that he was a Roman\r\nCatholic,--as we have record proof that all the Deputy Governors\r\nnamed in the recent commission were, I believe, without\r\nexception,--and that he was doubtless imbued with the dislike and\r\nindignation which naturally fired the gentlemen of his faith against\r\nthose who were supposed to be plotting the overthrow of the Proprietary\r\ngovernment, by exciting religious prejudice against the Baltimore\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING A PASS.\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF TROPICAL ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n[Continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, having collected such information bearing on\r\nour purposes as it was possible to obtain, we left La Union, and\r\nfairly commenced the business of \"Hunting a Pass.\" To reach the\r\nvalley of the Goascoran, on the extent and character of which so much\r\ndepended, it was necessary to go round the head of the Bay of La\r\nUnion. For several miles our route coincided with that of the _camino\r\nreal_ to San Miguel, and we rode along it gayly, in high and hopeful\r\nspirits. The morning was clear and bright, the air cool and\r\nexhilarating, and the very sense of existence was itself a luxury. At\r\nthe end of four miles we struck off from the high road, at right\r\nangles, into a narrow path, which conducted us over low grounds,\r\nthree miles farther, to the Rio Sirama, a small stream, scarcely\r\ntwenty feet across, the name of which is often erroneously changed in\r\nthe maps for that of Goascoran or Rio San Miguel. Beyond this stream\r\nthe path runs over low hills, which, however, subside into plains\r\nnear the bay, where the low grounds are covered with water at high\r\ntide. The natives avail themselves of this circumstance, as did the\r\nIndians before them, for the manufacture of salt. They inclose\r\nconsiderable areas with little dikes of mud, leaving openings for the\r\nentrance of the water, which are closed as the tide falls. The water\r\nthus retained is rapidly evaporated under a tropical sun, leaving the\r\nmud crusted over with salt. This is then scraped up, dissolved in\r\nwater, and strained to separate the impurities, and the saturated\r\nbrine reduced in earthen pots, set in long ranges of stone and clay.\r\nThe pots are constantly replenished, until they are filled with a\r\nsolid mass of salt; they are then removed bodily, packed in dry\r\nplantain-leaves, and sent to market on the backs of mules. Sometimes\r\nthe pots are broken off, to lighten the load, and great piles of\r\ntheir fragments--miniature _Monti testacci_--are seen around the\r\n_Salinas_, as these works are called, where they will remain long\r\nafter this rude system of salt-manufacture shall be supplanted by a\r\nbetter, as a puzzle for fledgling antiquaries.\r\n\r\nSix miles beyond the Rio Sirama we came to another stream, called the\r\nSiramita or Little Sirama, for the reason, probably, as H. suggested,\r\nthat it is four times as large as the Sirama. It flows through a bed\r\ntwenty feet deep and upwards of two hundred feet wide, paved with\r\nwater-worn stones, ragged with frayed fragments of trees, and\r\naffording abundant evidence that during the season of rains it is a\r\nrough and powerful torrent. Between this stream and the Goascoran\r\nthere is a maze of barren hills, relieved by occasional level\r\nreaches, covered with acacias and deciduous trees. Through these the\r\nroad winds in easy gradients, and there are numerous passes perfectly\r\nfeasible for a railway, in case it should ever be deemed advisable to\r\ncarry one around the head of the bay to La Union.\r\n\r\nThe traveller emerges suddenly from among these hills into the valley\r\nof the Goascoran, and finds the river a broad and gentle stream\r\nflowing at his feet. At the time of our passage, the water at the\r\nford was nowhere more than two feet deep, with gravelly bottom and\r\nhigh and firm banks, without traces of overflow. We had now passed\r\nthe threshold of the unknown region on which we were venturing, and\r\nalthough we had a moral conviction that the valley before us afforded\r\nthe requisite facilities for the enterprise which we had in hand, yet\r\nit was not without a deep feeling of satisfaction, almost of\r\nexultation, that, on riding to the summit of a bare knoll close by,\r\nwe traced the course of the river, in a graceful curve, along the\r\nfoot of the green hills on our left, and saw that it soon resumed its\r\ngeneral direction north and south, on the precise line most favorable\r\nfor our purposes. In the distance, rising alone in the very centre of\r\nthe valley, we discerned the castellated Rock of Goascoran, behind\r\nwhich, we were told, nestled the village of Goascoran, where we\r\nintended passing the night. We had taken its bearings from the top of\r\nConchagua, and were glad to find that the intervening country was\r\nlevel and open, chiefly savanna, or covered with scattered trees.\r\nThere was no need of instrumentation here, and so, ordering Dolores\r\nto bring up the baggage as rapidly as possible, we struck across the\r\nplain in a right line, in total disregard of roads or pathways, for\r\nthe Rock of Goascoran. A smart gallop of two hours brought us to its\r\nfoot, and in a few minutes after we entered the village, and rode\r\nstraight to the _Cabildo_, or House of the Municipality, tied our\r\nmules to the columns of the corridor, pushed open the door, and made\r\nourselves at home.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may mention that the _Cabildo_, throughout Honduras, is\r\nthe stranger's refuge. Its door is never locked, and every traveller,\r\nhigh or low, rich or poor, has a right to enter it unquestioned, and\r\n\"make it his hotel\" for the time being. Its accommodations, it is\r\ntrue, are seldom extensive and never sumptuous. They rarely consist\r\nof more than one or two hide-covered chairs, a rickety table, and two\r\nor three long benches placed against the wall, with a _tinaja_ or jar\r\nfor water in the corner, and possibly a clay oven or rude contrivance\r\nfor cooking under the back corridor. In all the more important\r\nvillages, which enjoy the luxury of a local court, the end of the\r\n_Cabildo_ is usually fenced off with wooden bars, as a prison.\r\nOccasionally the traveller finds it occupied by some poor devil of a\r\nprisoner, with his feet confined in stocks, to prevent his digging a\r\nhole through the mud walls or kicking down his prison-bars, who\r\nexhibits his ribs to prove that he is \"_muy flaco_,\" (very thin,) and\r\nsolicits, in the name of the Virgin and all the _Santos_, _\"algo para\r\ncomer\"_ (something to eat).\r\n\r\nIn most of the _cabildos_ there is suspended a rude drum, made by\r\ndrawing a raw hide over the end of a section of a hollow tree, which\r\nis primarily used to call together the municipal wisdom of the place,\r\nwhenever occasion requires, and secondarily by the traveller, who\r\nbeats on it as a signal to the _alguazils_, whose duty it is to\r\nrepair at once to the _Cabildo_ and supply the stranger with what he\r\nrequires, if obtainable in the town, at the rates there current. Not\r\nan unwise, nor yet an unnecessary regulation this, in a country where\r\nnobody thinks of producing more than is just necessary for his wants,\r\nand, having no need of money, one does not care to sell, lest his\r\nscanty store should run short, and he be compelled to go to work or\r\npurchase from his neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe people of Goascoran stared at us as we rode through their\r\nstreets, but none came near us until after we had vigorously pounded\r\nthe magical drum, when the _alguazils_ made their appearance,\r\nfollowed by all the urchins of the place, and by a crowd of lean and\r\nhungry curs,--the latter evidently in watery-mouthed anticipation of\r\nobtaining from the strangers, what they seldom got at home, a stray\r\ncrust or a marrow-bone. We informed our _alguazils_ that we had mules\r\ncoming, and wanted _sacate_ for them. To which they responded,--\r\n\r\n_\"No hay.\"_ (There is none.)\r\n\r\n\"Then let us have some maize.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Tampoco.\"_\r\n\r\n\"What! no maize? What do you make your _tortillas_ of?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no _tortillas_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't live.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must have something for our animals; they can't be allowed to\r\nstarve.\"\r\n\r\nTo which our _alguazil_ made no reply, but looked at us vacantly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear? we _must_ have some _sacate_ or some maize for the\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\nStill no reply,--only the same vacuous look,--now more stolid, if\r\npossible, than before.\r\n\r\nI had observed that the _Teniente's_ wrath was rising, and that an\r\nexplosion was imminent. But I must confess that I was not a little\r\nstartled, when, drawing his bowie-knife from his belt, he strode\r\nslowly up to our impassible friend, and, firmly grasping his right\r\near, applied the cold edge of the steel close to his head. The\r\nsupplementary _alguazil_ and the rabble of children took to their\r\nheels in affright, followed by the dogs, who seemed to sympathize in\r\ntheir alarm. But, beyond a slight wincing downwards, and a partial\r\ncontraction of his eyes and lips, the object of the _Teniente's_\r\nwrath made no movement, nor uttered a word of expostulation. He\r\nevidently expected to lose his ears, and probably was surprised at\r\nnothing except the pause in the operation. My own apprehensions were\r\nonly for an instant; but, had they been more serious than they were,\r\nthey must have given way before the extreme ludicrousness of the\r\ngroup. I burst into a roar of laughter, in which the _Teniente_ could\r\nnot resist joining, but which seemed to be incomprehensible to the\r\n_alguazil_, whose face assumed an expression which I can only\r\ndescribe as that of astonished inanity. I don't think he is quite\r\ncertain, to this day, that the incident was not altogether an ugly\r\ndream. At any rate, he lost no time in obeying my order to go\r\nstraight to the first _alcalde_ of the village, and tell him that he\r\nwas wanted at the _Cabildo_.\r\n\r\nReassured by seeing the _alguazil_ come out alive, the _muchachos_\r\nreturned, greatly reinforced, edging up to the open door timidly,\r\nready to retreat on our slightest movement. We had not long to wait\r\nfor the first _alcalde_, of whose approach we were warned by a sudden\r\nscramble of curs and children, who made a broad lane for his passage.\r\nEvidently, our _alcalde_ was a man of might in Goascoran, and he\r\nestablished an immediate hold on our hearts by stopping on the\r\ncorridor and clearing it of its promiscuous occupants by liberal\r\napplications of his official cane. He was a man of fifty, burly in\r\nperson, and wore his shirt outside of his trousers, but, altogether,\r\ncarried himself with an air of authority. He was prompt in speech,\r\nand, although evidently much surprised to find a party of foreigners\r\nin the _Cabildo_, rapidly followed up his salutation by putting\r\nhimself and the town and all the people in it \"at the disposition of\r\nour Worships.\"\r\n\r\nI explained to him how it was that he had been sent for, placing due\r\nemphasis on the stupidity of the _alguazil_. He heard me without\r\ninterruption, keeping, however, one eye on the _alguazil_, and\r\nhandling his cane nervously. By the time I had finished, the cane\r\nfairly quivered; and the delinquent himself, who had scarcely\r\nflinched under the _Teniente's_ knife, was now uneasily stealing away\r\ntowards the door. Our _alcalde_ saw the movement, and, with a hurried\r\nbow, and _\"Con permiso, Caballeros\"_ (With your permission,\r\ngentlemen,) started after the fugitive, who was saluted with _\"Que\r\nbestia!\"_ (What a beast!) and a staggering blow over his shoulders.\r\nHe hurried his pace, but the _alcalde's_ cane followed close, and\r\nwith vigorous application, half-way across the _plaza_. And when the\r\n_alcalde_ returned, out of breath, but full of apologies, he received\r\na welcome such as could be inspired only by a profound faith in his\r\nability and willingness to secure for us not merely _sacate_ and\r\nmaize, but everything else that we might desire. We told him that he\r\nwas a model officer and a man after our own hearts, all of which he\r\nlistened to with dignified modesty, wiping the perspiration from his\r\nface, meanwhile, with--well, with the tail of his shirt!\r\n\r\nThe _alcalde_ was very hard on his constituency, and, from all that\r\nwe could gather, he seemed to regard them collectively as\r\n_\"bestias_,\" and _\"hombres sin vergüenza\"_ (men without shame). We\r\nconcurred with him, and regretted that he had not a wider and more\r\nelevated official sphere, and gave him, withal, a _trago_ of brandy,\r\nwhich he seemed greatly to relish, and then again approached the\r\nsubject of _sacate_ for our mules. To our astonishment, the _alcalde_\r\nsuddenly grew grave, and interrupted me with--\r\n\r\n_\"Pero, no hay, Señor_.\" (But there is none, Sir.)\r\n\r\n\"Well, maize will answer.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Tampoco_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! no maize? What do you make your _tortillas_ of?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no _tortillas_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't live.\"\r\n\r\nA general shout of laughter greeted this last reply, in which, after\r\na moment of puzzled hesitation, the _alcalde_ himself joined.\r\n\r\n\"So, you don't live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little. We are very poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheese, _frijoles_, and an egg now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, no _tortillas_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We planted the last kernel of maize two days ago.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. The little stock of dried grass and maize-stalks\r\nstored up from the present rainy season had long ago been consumed,\r\nand the maize itself, which is here the real staff of life, had run\r\nshort,--and that, too, in a country where three crops a year might\r\neasily be produced by a very moderate expenditure of labor in the way\r\nof tillage and irrigation.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our poor animals, Dolores had provided against\r\ncontingencies like this, and taken in a supply of maize at La Union.\r\nAs for ourselves, what with a few eggs and _frijoles_, furnished by\r\nthe _alcalde_, in addition to the stock of edibles, pickled oysters\r\nand other luxuries, prepared for us by Doña Maria, we contrived to\r\nfare right sumptuously in Goascoran. We afterwards found out,\r\nexperimentally, what it was not to live, in the sense intended to be\r\nconveyed by the unfortunate _alguazil_ and the impetuous _alcalde_,\r\nand which H. declared logically meant to be without _tortillas_--But\r\nwe could never make out why the alcalde should call the _alguazil_ \"a\r\nbeast,\" and beat him over his shoulders with a cane, withal.\r\n\r\nGoascoran is a small town, of about four hundred inhabitants, and\r\nboasts a tolerably genteel church and a comfortable _cabildo_. It is\r\nsituated on the left bank of the river to which it gives its name,\r\nand which here still maintains its character of a broad and beautiful\r\nstream. On the opposite side from the town rises a high, picturesque\r\nbluff, at the foot of which the river gathers its waters in deep,\r\ndark pools with mirror-like surfaces, disturbed only by the splash of\r\nfishes springing at their prey, or by the sudden dash of water-fowls\r\nsettling from their arrowy flight in a little cloud of spray.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the castellated Rock of Goascoran, which, however,\r\nis only a type of the general features of the surrounding country.\r\nThe prevailing rock is sandstone, and it is broken up in fantastic\r\npeaks, or great cubical blocks with flat tops and vertical walls,\r\nresembling the mesas of New Mexico. At night, their dark masses,\r\nrising on every hand, might be mistaken for frowning fortresses or\r\nmassive strongholds of the Middle Ages. They seem to mark the line\r\nwhere the volcanic forces which raised the high islands in the Bay of\r\nFonseca had their first conflict with the sedimentary and primitive\r\nrocks of the interior. The river is full of boulders of quartz and\r\ngranite reddened by fire, resembling jasper, and alternating with\r\nworn blocks of lava,--further evidences of volcanic action.\r\nAltogether, the country, in its natural aspects, reminds the\r\ntraveller of the district lying between Pompeii and Sorrento, in\r\nItaly, and probably owes its essential features to the same causes.\r\n\r\nFrom Goascoran to Aramacina, a distance of twelve miles, the road\r\ntraverses a slightly broken country, while the river pursues its\r\ncourse, as before, through a picturesque valley, narrowed in places\r\nby outlying _mesas_, but still regular, and throughout perfectly\r\nfeasible for a railway. Aramacina itself is prettily situated, in a\r\nbend of one of the tributaries of the Goascoran, the Rio Aramacina,\r\nand numbers perhaps three hundred inhabitants. Immediately in front\r\nrises a broad sandstone table or _mesa_, at the foot of which there\r\nare some trickling springs of salt water, much frequented by cattle,\r\nand corresponding to the _saltlicks_ of our Western States.\r\n\r\nBehind the town is a high spur of the mountain range of Lepaterique,\r\ncovered with pines, and veined with silver-bearing quartz. We visited\r\nthe abandoned mines of Marqueliso and Potosí, but the shafts were\r\nfilled with water, and only faint traces remained of the ancient\r\nestablishments. Extravagant traditions are current of the wealth of\r\nthese mines, and of the amounts of treasure which were taken from\r\nthem in the days of the Viceroys. A few specimens of the refuse ore,\r\nwhich we picked up at the mouth of the principal shaft, proved, on\r\nanalysis, to be exceedingly rich, and gave some color to the local\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nThe _cabildo_ of Aramacina was very much dilapidated, and promised us\r\nbut poor protection against the rain, which now began to fall every\r\nnight with the greatest regularity. We nevertheless selected the\r\ncorner where the roof appeared soundest, and managed to pass the\r\nnight without a serious wetting. The evening was enlivened by visits\r\nfrom all the leading inhabitants, whom we found to be far more\r\ncommunicative than their neighbors of Goascoran. Our most\r\nentertaining visitor, however, was a \"countryman,\" as he styled\r\nhimself, a negro by the name of John Robinson, born in New York, and\r\nnow a magnate in Aramacina, where he had resided for upwards of\r\nsixteen years. Although he had fallen into the habits of the native\r\npopulation, and wore neither shirt nor shoes, he entertained for them\r\na superlative contempt, which he expressed in a strange jumble of bad\r\nEnglish and worse Spanish. He had been with Perry on Lake Erie, and\r\nafterwards on board various vessels of war, in some capacity which he\r\ndid not explain with great clearness, but which he evidently intended\r\nshould be understood as but little lower than that of commander. A\r\nglass of brandy made him eloquent, and he took a position in the\r\nmiddle of the _cabildo_, and gave us an oration on the people of\r\nHonduras, in a style singularly grotesque and demonstrative. In\r\nbroken and scarcely intelligible English,--for he had nearly\r\nforgotten the language of his youth,--he denounced them as \"thieves\r\nand liars,\" and then asked them, \"Is it not true?\" Imagining,\r\ndoubtless, that he was declaiming their praises, the enthusiastic\r\nassemblage responded, _\"Sí! sí!\"_ (Yes! yes!) Not a crime so gross,\r\nnor a trait of character so degraded, but he laid it to their charge,\r\nreceiving always the same vehement response, _\"Sí! Sí!\"_\r\n\r\nWe got rid of our _paisano_ with difficulty, and only under a promise\r\nto visit his _chacra_, somewhere in the vicinity, next morning. But\r\nwe saw no more of him,--not much to our regret; for John Robinson, I\r\nfear, was sadly addicted to brandy, of which our supply was far too\r\nsmall to admit of honoring many such drafts as he had made the\r\npreceding evening.\r\n\r\nOne and a half miles to the southeast of Aramacina is a ledge of\r\nsandstone rock, with a smooth vertical face, which is covered over\r\nwith figures, deeply cut in outline. This ledge forms one side of a\r\nrural amphitheatre overlooking the adjacent valley, and is by nature\r\na spot likely to be selected as a \"sacred place\" by the Indians. It\r\nfaces towards the west, and from all parts of the amphitheatre, which\r\nmay have answered the purposes of a temple, the morning sun would\r\nappear to rise directly over the rock. The engravings in some places\r\nare much defaced or worn by time, so that they cannot be made out;\r\nbut generally they are deep and distinct,--so deep, indeed, that I\r\nused those which run horizontally as steps whereby to climb up the\r\nface of the ledge. I should say that they were two and a half inches\r\ndeep. A portion had been effaced by a rude quarry which the people of\r\nAramacina had opened here to obtain stone for their church.\r\n\r\nSome of the figures are easily recognizable as those of men and\r\nanimals, while others appear entirely arbitrary, or designed simply\r\nfor ornament. Enough can be clearly made out to show the affiliation\r\nof the engravers with the ancient Mexican families of Nicaragua and\r\nSan Salvador. The space covered by these inscriptions is about one\r\nhundred feet long, by twelve or fifteen in height. A quarter of a\r\nmile to the southward are other smaller rocks with figures, too much\r\ndefaced, however, to be traced satisfactorily. Vases of curious\r\nworkmanship, human bones in considerable quantities, and other relics\r\nand remains, it is said, may be discovered by digging in the earth\r\nanywhere within the natural amphitheatre to which I have referred.\r\nThis is another circumstance going to favor the belief that this was\r\nanciently a place of great sanctity; for it is a universal custom\r\namong all nations to bury their dead in the neighborhood of shrines\r\nand temples.\r\n\r\nAlthough the immediate district in which these aboriginal traces are\r\nfound does not seem to have fallen within the region occupied by the\r\nNahuatt or Mexican tribes of Central America at the time of the\r\nConquest, but in what was called the country of the Chontals, yet it\r\nis not difficult to suppose, that, in the various hostile encounters\r\nwhich we know took place between the two nations, the Nahuatts may\r\nhave penetrated as far as Aramacina, and left here some record of\r\ntheir visit,--if, indeed, they did not succeed in effecting a\r\ntemporary lodgment. At any rate, there can be but little doubt that a\r\nportion of the engravings on the rocks above described, but\r\nparticularly those which seem to record dates, were made by them.\r\n\r\nFrom Aramacina to Caridad, the next town on our course, and four\r\nleagues distant, the road is laid out on Spanish principles, which\r\nare the very reverse of scientific. Instead of keeping along the\r\nriver-valley, it passes directly over a high, rocky spur of the\r\nlateral mountains, through a pass called _El Portillo_, (The Portal,)\r\nelevated fifteen hundred feet above the sea. The view from its\r\nsummit, whence we were enabled to trace our course up to this point,\r\nas if on a map, in some degree compensated us for the labor of the\r\nascent. From here we could also look ahead, beyond the town of\r\nCaridad; and we saw, with some misgivings, that there the lateral\r\nranges of mountains seemed to send down their spurs boldly to the\r\nriver, leaving only what the Spaniards call a _canon_ or narrow\r\ngorge, walled in with precipitous rocks, for its passage. A shadow\r\ncame over every face, in view of the possible obstacles in our path;\r\nand although we tried to reassure ourselves by the reflection, that,\r\nwhere so large a stream could pass, there must certainly be room\r\nenough for a road, yet, it must be confessed, we wound down the hill\r\nof El Portillo to Caridad with spirits much depressed. Moreover, a\r\ndrizzling rain set in before we reached the village, and clouds and\r\nvapor settled down gloomily on the surrounding hills and mountains,\r\nrendering us altogether more dismal than we had been since leaving\r\nNew York. We rode up to the _cabildo_ of Caridad in silence, and\r\nfortunately found it new, neat, and comfortable, with cover for our\r\nmules, ample facilities for cooking, and an abundance of dry wood for\r\na fire, now rendered necessary to comfort by the damp, and the\r\nproximity of high mountains. Fortunately, also, we experienced no\r\ndifficulty in getting fodder for our animals and food for\r\nourselves,--a bright-eyed Señora, wife of the principal _alcalde_,\r\nvolunteering to send us freshly baked and crisp _tortillas_, which\r\nwere brought to us hot, in the folds of the whitest of napkins. After\r\ndinner and coffee, and under the genial influences of a fire of the\r\npitch-pine, which gave us both light and heat, our spirits returned,\r\nand we did not refuse a hearty laugh, when H. read from a dingy\r\npaper, which he found sticking on the wall of the _cabildo_, the\r\nreport of the day's transactions on the Caridad Exchange, \"marked by\r\na great and sudden decline in railway shares, caused by the timidity\r\nof holders, and by an equally sudden reaction, occasioned by two\r\ndozen of soft-boiled eggs and a peck of _tortillas_.\"\r\n\r\nCaridad is a neat little town, of about three hundred inhabitants,\r\nsituated on a level plateau nearly surrounded by high mountains,--the\r\nvalley of the river, both above and below, being reduced to its\r\nnarrowest limits. To the northeastward of the town, and on a shelf of\r\nthe Lepaterique Mountains, which rise abruptly in that direction, and\r\nare covered with pine forests to their summits, is distinctly visible\r\nthe Indian town of Lauterique,--its position indicating clearly that\r\nit had been selected with reference to defensive purposes. We had\r\nseen its white church from El Portillo, looking like a point of\r\nsilver on the dark green slope of the mountain.\r\n\r\nRain fell heavily during the night; but the morning broke bright and\r\nclear. The increased roar of the river, however, made known to us\r\nthat it was greatly swollen, and when we walked down to its brink we\r\nfound it a rapid and angry torrent, with its volume of water more\r\nthan double that of the previous day. This was not an encouraging\r\ncircumstance; for we had learned, that, if we intended following up\r\nthe stream, instead of making a grand _détour_ over the mountains, it\r\nwould be necessary to ford the river, about a mile above the town.\r\nAll advised us against attempting the passage. _\"Mañana_,\"\r\n(Tomorrow,) they said, would do as well, and we had better wait.\r\nMeanwhile the waters would subside. Nobody had ever attempted the\r\npassage after such a storm; and the river was _\"muy bravo\"_ (very\r\nangry). I have said that all advised us against moving; but I should\r\nexcept the second _alcalde_, who had taken a great fancy to us, and\r\nwanted to enter our service. His dignity did not rebel at the\r\nposition of _arriero_ or muleteer; any place would suit him, so that\r\nwe would agree to take him finally to \"El Norte,\"--for such is the\r\nuniversal designation of the United States among the people of\r\nCentral America. He shared in none of the fears of his townsmen, and\r\ntold them, that, fortunately, all the world was not as timid as\r\nthemselves, and wound up by volunteering to accompany us and get us\r\nacross. We gladly accepted his offer, and started out with the least\r\npossible delay. I need not say that we made rather an anxious party.\r\nThe unpromising observations of the preceding day, and the\r\npossibilities of the mountains' closing down on the river so as to\r\nforbid a passage, were uppermost in every mind; but all sought to\r\nhide their real feelings under an affectation of cheerfulness, not to\r\nsay of absolute gayety. As we advanced, and rounded the hills which\r\nshut in the little _plateau_ of Caridad on the north, we saw that the\r\nhigh lateral mountains sent down their rocky spurs towards each other\r\nlike huge buttresses, lapping by, and, so far as the eye could\r\ndiscern, forming a complete and insurmountable barrier. Over the brow\r\nof one of these, a zigzag streak of white marked the line of the\r\nmule-path. Our guide traced it out to us with his finger, and assured\r\nus that it traversed a bad _portillo_, over which the wind sometimes\r\nsweeps with such force as to take a loaded mule off his feet, and\r\ndash him down the steep sides of the mountain. Half a mile of level\r\nground still intervened between us and the apparent limit of our\r\nadvance, and we trotted over it in silence, pulling up on the abrupt\r\nbank of the deep trough of the river, which foamed and chafed among\r\nthe great boulders in its bed, and against its rocky shores, nearly a\r\nhundred feet below us. A break-neck path wound down to a little\r\nsandpit; and on the opposite side of the stream another path wound\r\nup, in like manner, to a narrow _plateau_, on which stood a single\r\nhut, with its surroundings of plantain-trees and maize-fields. I\r\nlooked anxiously up the stream, but a sudden bend, a few hundred\r\nyards above, shut off the view; and there the flinty buttresses of\r\nthe mountain rose sheer and frowning, perpendicularly from the\r\nwater's edge.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Lieutenant had followed mine, and we exchanged a\r\nglance which expressed as plainly as words, that, unless the\r\nmountain-spur which projected into the bend of the river should prove\r\nsufficiently narrow to be tunnelled, or should fall off so as to\r\nadmit of a side-cutting in the rock, our project might be regarded as\r\nat an end. To determine that point was our next and most important\r\nstep. Down the steep descent, scrambling amongst rocks and bushes,\r\nwhere it seemed a goat would hardly dare to venture,--down we plunged\r\nto the water's edge. Here the stream was not less than a hundred\r\nyards broad, flowing over a rocky bed full of rolling stones and\r\nboulders, with a velocity which it seemed impossible for man or beast\r\nto stem. But our _alcalde_ was equal to the emergency.\r\n\r\nStripping himself naked, he took a long pole shod with iron, which\r\nseemed to be kept here for the purpose, and started out boldly into\r\nthe stream, for the purpose of making a preliminary survey of the\r\nline of passage. Planting his pole firmly down the stream, so as to\r\nsupport himself against the current, he cautiously advanced, step by\r\nstep, \"prospecting\" the bottom with his feet, so as to ascertain the\r\nshallowest ford, and that freest from rocks and stones. Sometimes he\r\nslipped into deep holes and disappeared beneath the surface, but be\r\nalways recovered himself, and went on with his work with the greatest\r\ndeliberation and composure. After crossing and recrossing the river\r\nin this manner three or four times, he succeeded in fixing on a\r\nserpentine line, where the water, except for a few yards near the\r\nopposite bank, was only up to his shoulders, and which he pronounced\r\n_\"muy factible\"_ (very feasible).\r\n\r\n\"But, _amigo\"_ exclaimed H., in an excited tone, \"you forget that you\r\nare six feet high, and that I am but five feet five!\"\r\n\r\n_\"No hay cuidado!\"_ (Have no care!) was the reassuring reply of the\r\nalcalde, as he slapped his broad chest with his open palm; _\"soy\r\nresponsable!\"_ (I am responsible!)\r\n\r\nThe mules were now unsaddled, and the trunks taken over, one by one,\r\non the _alcalde's_ head. Next, the animals were forced into the\r\nwater, and, after vehement flounderings, now swimming, now stumbling\r\nover rolling stones, they were finally, bruised and bleeding and the\r\nforlornest of animals, got across in safety. Next came our turn, and\r\nI led the way, with a thong fastened around my body below the\r\narmpits, and attached, in like manner, to our stalwart _alcalde_.\r\nLong before we reached the middle of the stream, notwithstanding I\r\ncarried a large stone under each arm by way of ballast, I was swept\r\nfrom my feet out to the length of my tether, and thus towed over by\r\nour guide. When all were snugly across, the laughter was loud and\r\nlong over the ridiculous figure which everybody had cut in\r\neverybody's eyes, except his own. H. immortalized the transit in what\r\nthe French call _un croquis_, but it would hardly bear reproduction\r\nin the pages of a narrative so staid as this.\r\n\r\nIntent on determining, with the least possible delay, the important\r\nquestion, whether the mountains really opposed an insurmountable\r\nobstacle to our project, I left my companions and Dolores to resaddle\r\nand get under way at their leisure, and pushed ahead with the\r\n_alcalde_. Striking off from the mule-path, we climbed up, among\r\nloose rocks and dwarf-trees and bushes, to the top of the mountain.\r\nMy excitement gave me unwonted vigor, and my sturdy guide, streaming\r\nwith perspiration long before we reached the summit, prayed me, \"in\r\nthe name of all the saints,\" to moderate my rate of speed, and give\r\nhim a _trago_ of Cognac. My suspense was not of long duration; for,\r\non reaching the crest of the eminence, I found that we were indeed on\r\na narrow spur, easily tunnelled, or readily turned by galleries in\r\nthe rock, and that, beyond, the country opened out again in a broad\r\ntable-land sloping gently from the north, and traversed nearly in its\r\ncentre by the gorge of the river. The break in the Cordilleras was\r\nnow distinct, and I could look quite through it, and see the blue\r\npeaks of the mountains on the Atlantic slope of the continent. A\r\nsingle glance sufficed to disclose all this to my eager vision, and\r\nthe next instant six rapid shots from my revolver conveyed the\r\nintelligence to my companions, who were toiling up the narrow\r\nmule-path, half a mile to my right. The _Teniente_ dismounted, evidently\r\nwith the intention of joining us, but soon got back again into his\r\nsaddle,--having experienced, as H. explained, \"a sudden recurrence of\r\npalpitation.\"\r\n\r\nRejoining my companions, I dismissed our guide with a reward which\r\nsurprised him, and we pursued our way to the _Portillo_. This name is\r\ngiven to the point where the path, after winding up the side of the\r\nmountain half-way to its summit, suddenly turns round its brow, and\r\ncommences its descent. It is a narrow shelf, in some places scarcely\r\nmore than a foot wide, rudely worked in the living rock, which falls\r\noff below in a steep and almost precipitous descent to the river; and\r\nalthough it did not quite realize the idea we had formed of it from\r\nthe description of our guide, it was sufficiently pokerish to inspire\r\nthe most daring mountaineer with caution. At any rate, most of our\r\nparty dismounted, preferring to lead their mules around the point to\r\nhaving their heads turned in riding past it. Exposed to the full\r\nforce of the winds, which are drawn through this river-valley as\r\nthrough a funnel, and with a foothold so narrow, it was easy to\r\nbelieve that neither man nor beast could pass here during the season\r\nof the northers, except at great risk of being dashed down the\r\ndeclivity.\r\n\r\nA little beyond the _Portillo_, the road diverges from the valley\r\nproper of the river, and is carried over an undulating country to the\r\nvillage of San Antonio del Norte, finely situated on a grassy plain,\r\nof considerable extent, a dependency of the valley of the Goascoran.\r\nWe had intended stopping here for the night; but the _cabildo_ was\r\nalready filled with a motley crowd of _arrieros_ and others on their\r\nway to San Miguel. A tall _mestizo_, covered with ulcers, sat in the\r\ndoorway, and two or three culprits extended their claw-like hands\r\ntowards us through the bars of their cage and invoked alms in the\r\nname of the Virgin and all things sacred. We therefore contented\r\nourselves with a lunch under the corridor of a neighboring house,\r\nand, notwithstanding it was late in the afternoon, pressed forward\r\ntowards the little Indian town of San Juan, three leagues distant.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and rough and weary way, and as night fell without any\r\nsign of a village in front, we began to have a painful suspicion that\r\nwe had lost our road,--if a narrow mule-path, often scarcely\r\ntraceable, can be dignified by that name. So we stopped short, to\r\nallow a man on foot, whom we had observed following on our track for\r\nhalf an hour, to come up. He proved to be a bright-eyed, good-natured\r\nIndian, who addressed us as _\"Vuestras Mercedes_,\" and who informed\r\nus not only that we were on the right road to San Juan, but also that\r\nhe himself belonged there and was now on his way home.\r\n\r\n\"Good, _amigo!_--but how far is it?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Hay no mas\"_ (There is no more,) was the consoling response.\r\n\r\n\"But where is the town?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Allá!\"_ (There!)\r\n\r\nAnd he threw his hand forward, and projected his lips in the\r\ndirection he sought to indicate,--a mode of indication, I may add,\r\nalmost universal in Central America, and explicable only on the\r\nassumption that it costs less effort than to raise the hand.\r\n\r\nOur new friend was communicative, and told us that he had been all\r\nthe way to Caridad to bring a priest to San Juan, _\"para hacer cosas\r\nde familia_,\" (to attend to family affairs,) which he explained as\r\nmeaning \"to marry, baptize, and catechize.\" The people of San Juan,\r\nhe added, were too poor to keep a priest of their own; they couldn't\r\npay enough; and, moreover, their women were all old and ugly. And he\r\nindulged in a knowing wink and chuckle.\r\n\r\nMeantime we had kept on our course, and it had become quite dark;\r\nstill there was no sign of the village,--not even the flicker of\r\nlights or the barking of dogs.\r\n\r\n\"What did the fellow say about the distance?\" inquired H., angrily.\r\n\r\n\"That there was no more distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him again; he couldn't have understood you.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Amigo_, where is your village? You said just now that it was close\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Hay no masita, Señor!\"_\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He says that the distance was nothing before, and is still less\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! he's a fool!\" Half an hour later, which to H.'s indignant\r\nimagination seemed an age, we reached the top of a high ridge, and\r\nsaw the first glimmer of the lights of the village, on the farther\r\nedge of a broad plain, a mile and a half distant.\r\n\r\n_\"Estamos aquí!\"_ (Here we are!) exclaimed our guide, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nOur mules pricked forward their ears at the welcome sight, and we\r\ntrotted briskly over the plain, and, as usual, straight to the\r\n_cabildo_,--a newly constructed edifice of canes plastered with mud,\r\nbut, for a tropical country, suffering under the slight defect of\r\nhaving no windows or aperture for ventilation besides the door. The\r\ndrum brought us the most attentive of _alguazils_, and we fared by no\r\nmeans badly in San Juan; that is to say, we had plenty of milk and\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was over, H. lighted a pine splinter, and put on record\r\nhis \"Observations on the Standard of Measurement in Honduras,\" which\r\nI am allowed to copy for the information of travellers.\r\n\r\n\"Distances here are computed by what may be called Long Measure.\r\nLeague is a vague term, and, like _x_ in an algebraic equation,\r\nstands for an unknown quantity. It may mean ten miles, more or\r\nless,--any distance, in fact, over five miles. The unit of measure,\r\nas fixed by law, is _estamos aquí_, (here we are,) which is a mile\r\nand a half; _hay no masita_ (a little less than nothing) is five\r\nmiles; _hay no mas_ (there is no more) is ten miles; and _muy cerca_\r\n(very near) is a hard day's journey. As regards spirituous liquors, a\r\n_trago_ of brandy, or 'a drink,' is whatever may be in the bottle, be\r\nthe same large or small, and the quantity more or less.\"\r\n\r\nSan Juan is insignificant in point of size, but its population seems\r\nto be well to do in the world, in the relative sense in which that\r\nterm is to be interpreted in Central America. Here we found that the\r\nriver forks,--the principal branch, however, which retains the name\r\nof Goascoran, still preserving its general course north and south.\r\nThe smaller branch, called Rio de San Juan, descends from high\r\nmountains to the westward, having its rise, we were told, near the\r\nsecluded Indian _pueblos_ of Similaton and Opotoro. We found the\r\nelevation of San Juan to be nine hundred feet above the sea,--an\r\naltitude sufficiently great, combined with the proximity of the\r\nCordilleras, to give it a generally cool and delightful climate. The\r\nchange in temperature from that of the sea-coast, however, is less\r\nmarked than the change in scenery and vegetation. It is true, we find\r\nthe ever-graceful palm, the orange, plantain, and other tropical\r\nfruit-trees; but the country is no longer loaded down with forests.\r\nIt spreads out before the traveller in a succession of swelling hills\r\nand level savannas, clothed with grass, and clumped over with pines,\r\nand miniature parks of deciduous trees, sufficiently open to permit\r\ncattle and horsemen to roam freely in every direction. During the dry\r\nseason, however, this open region becomes dry and parched, and the\r\ntraveller passing over it then would be apt to pronounce the whole\r\ncountry sterile and without cultivation. But in little lateral\r\nvalleys and _coves_ among the mountains, sheltered from the sun, and\r\nwatered by springs or running streams, there are many plantations of\r\nsugar-cane, maize, rice, and other standard products of the tropics,\r\nof unsurpassed luxuriance. We sometimes came on these green places\r\nunexpectedly, far away from any habitation, and all the more gem-like\r\nand beautiful from their rough setting of sere savanna and rugged\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nWe left San Juan early in the morning, crossing to the left bank of\r\nthe river, still a noble stream, a hundred and fifty feet broad, and\r\npure as crystal. A government _tambo_, or _rancho_, opposite the\r\ntown, on the bank, indicated that even here the river was sometimes\r\nunfordable. Hence the construction of this public shelter for\r\ntravellers obliged to wait for the subsidence of the waters. These\r\ngovernment _ranchos_ are common on all the roads, in the less\r\npopulous parts of the country, or where the towns are widely\r\nseparated, and are the refuge of the wayfarer benighted or overtaken\r\nby a storm in his journey. They seldom consist of more than four\r\nforked posts planted in the ground, supporting a roof of _paja_ or\r\nthatch. Occasionally one or two sides are wattled up with canes, or\r\nclosed with poles placed closely together. They are usually built\r\nwhere some spring or stream furnishes a supply of water, and where\r\nthere is an open patch of pasturage; and although they afford nothing\r\nbeyond shelter, they are always welcome retreats to the weary or\r\nbelated traveller. For one, I generally preferred stopping in them to\r\npassing the night in the little villages, where the _cabildos_ are\r\noften dirty and infested with fleas, and where a horrible concert is\r\nkept up by the lean and mangy curs which throughout Central America\r\ndisgrace the respectable name of dog. In fact, a large part of the\r\nromance and many of the pleasantest recollections of our adventures\r\nin Honduras are connected with these rude shelters, and with the long\r\nnights which we passed in them, far away in dark valleys, or on\r\nmountain-crests, but always amongst Nature's deepest solitudes.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the river, our path, with the perversity of all\r\nSpanish roads, instead of following up the valley of the stream,\r\ndiverged widely to the right through a cluster or knot of hills, in\r\nwhich we were involved until we reached a rapid stream called Rio\r\nGuanupalapa, flowing through a narrow gorge, over a wild mass of\r\nstones and boulders. Here we breakfasted, picturesquely enough, and,\r\nresuming our course, soon emerged from the hilly labyrinth on a\r\nseries of terraces, falling off like steps to the river on our left.\r\nThey had been burned over, and the young grass was sprouting up,\r\nunder the freshening influence of the early rain, in a carpet of\r\ntranslucent green. At a distance of four leagues from San Juan, after\r\ndescending from terrace to terrace, we again reached the river, now\r\nflowing through a valley three hundred yards broad, and about fifty\r\nfeet below the general level of the adjacent _plateau_. Here we found\r\nanother fork in the stream: the principal body of water descending,\r\nas before, from the right, and called Rio Rancho Grande; the smaller\r\nstream, on the left, bearing the name of Rio Chaguiton; and the two\r\nforming the Rio Goascoran. Half a mile beyond the ford is a\r\ncollection of three or four huts, called Rancho Grande. Here we\r\nstopped to determine our position. We were now at the foot of the\r\n\"divide,\" and close to the pass, if such existed, of which we were in\r\nsearch. Immediately in front rose a high peak, destitute of trees,\r\nwhich the people called _El Volcan_. It had deep breaks or valleys on\r\neither side, evidently those of the streams to which I have alluded.\r\nOutside of these, the mountains, six or eight thousand feet in\r\nheight, swept round in a majestic curve. Were there, then, two passes\r\nthrough the Cordilleras, separated by the conical peak of El Volcan?\r\nor did the great valley of the Goascoran divide here, only to waste\r\nitself away in narrow gorges, leaving a summit too high to be\r\ntraversed except by mountain mules?\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the occupants of the huts at Rancho Grande could give\r\nus no information on these points, but to all our inquiries only\r\nanswered, _\"Quien sabe?\"_ (Who knows?)--and pointed out to us the\r\nline of the mule-path, winding over the intervening hills and along\r\nthe flank of El Volcan. Up to this time we had had comparatively\r\nsmall experience, and did not quite understand, what we afterwards\r\ncame to know too well, that a Spanish road is perfect only when it\r\nruns over the highest and roughest ground that by any possibility may\r\nbe selected between two given points.\r\n\r\nWe did not waste much time with the people of Rancho Grande, but\r\nurged on our mules as rapidly as possible. Turning abruptly to the\r\nright and leaving the _plateau_ behind us, we advanced straight up\r\nthe high ridge intervening between the two valleys, and thence in a\r\nzigzag course to the foot of El Volcan, a mass of igneous rock,\r\nprotruded through the horizontal sandstone strata,--the gradual\r\nrecession of which gives to the country the terraced character to\r\nwhich I have so often alluded. Leaving our mules here, H. and myself\r\nclambered up amongst rough and angular rocks, strewn in wildest\r\ndisorder, to the bare and rugged summit of El Volcan. From this\r\ncommanding position the view was unobstructed all the way back to the\r\nPacific. The whole valley of the river, and line of our\r\n_reconnaissance_, the _Portillo_ of Caridad, the Rock of Goascoran,\r\nthe Volcano of Conchagua, and the high islands of the Bay of Fonseca,\r\nwere all included in the view. Rancho Grande and the fork of the\r\nriver appeared at our feet; and on the right hand and the left,\r\nextending upwards in nearly parallel directions, were the deep\r\nvalleys of the rivers Rancho Grande and Chaguiton,--that of the\r\nformer clothed with pines, while that of the latter presented only a\r\nsuccession of savannas, with here and there a group of forest-trees.\r\nOur view to the northward, however, was obstructed by hills and\r\nforests, and our ascent of El Volcan failed to give us a view of the\r\nPass, which we knew must now be near at hand. We descended,\r\ntherefore, and resumed our course,--anxiously, it is true, but with\r\nfew of the serious misgivings which had beset us at Caridad.\r\n\r\nThe path wound around the base of El Volcan, on the level terrace or\r\nshelf from which it springs. As we advanced, we could distinctly\r\nperceive that the valley to our right rose gradually, with a gentle,\r\nbut constant grade. At a distance of three miles it had nearly\r\nreached the level of the terrace along which we rode, and at the end\r\nof our fourth mile the terrace and the valley merged into each other,\r\nand the mule-path dipping into the waters of the stream, now reduced\r\nto a sparkling brook, resumed its direction on the opposite bank. We\r\nstopped here, in a natural park of tall pines, and lunched beneath\r\ntheir shade, drinking only the cool, clear water which murmured among\r\nthe mossy stones at our feet. We needed no artificial stimulus; our\r\nspirits were high and buoyant; we had almost traced the\r\nGoascoran to its source; half an hour more must bring us to its\r\nfountain-head,--and then? We knew not exactly what then; but one\r\nthing was certain, that nothing in the form of a hill or mountain\r\nobstructed our advance, for the light, reflected from a clear sky,\r\nstreamed horizontally between the tree-trunks in front, while on either\r\nhand the vistas were dark, and the outlines of gigantic mountains could be\r\ndiscerned towering to mid-heaven.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile farther on, crossing in the interval a number of little\r\ntributary streams, we came where the pines were more scattered; they\r\nsoon disappeared, and we emerged upon an open glade or natural\r\nmeadow. A high mountain, dark with forests, rose on our right; on the\r\nleft was a long range of grassy hills; but in front all was clear! A\r\ngovernment _rancho_, built under the shade of a couple of tall\r\nfruit-trees, stood in the middle of the savanna, and on its farther edge\r\nwere the cane buildings of a cattle-_hacienda_, just visible through\r\nthe wealth of plantain-trees by which they were surrounded, while the\r\ncattle themselves were dotted over the intervening space, cropping\r\nthe young grass, which here looked brighter and fresher than in the\r\nvalley below. Impulsively my mule pricked her ears forward, and broke\r\ninto a rapid trot. Soon she stepped across the stream, which we had\r\nfollowed to its birthplace, now reduced to a trickling rivulet\r\nstealing out from a spring, \"an eye of water,\" (_ojo de agua_,) coyly\r\nhidden away under a clump of trees draped with evergreen vines at the\r\nfoot of the neighboring hills. I knew that we were at the \"summit\";\r\nthe faint swell of the savanna, scarcely perceptible to the eye,\r\nwhich supported the government _rancho_, it was clear, was the\r\nhighest point between the two great oceans, and the cool breeze which\r\nfanned our foreheads was the expiring breath of the trade-winds\r\ncoming all the way from the Bay of Honduras! My mule halted at the\r\n_rancho_; I threw the bridle over her neck, and went forward on foot;\r\nbut I had not proceeded a hundred paces before my attention was\r\narrested by the cheerful murmur of another little stream, also\r\ndescending from the foot of the mountain at our right,--but this\r\ntime, after traversing half the width of the savanna, it turned away\r\nsuddenly to the north, and with a merry dash and sparkling leap\r\nstarted off on its journey to the Atlantic! In that direction,\r\nhowever, a forest of tall pines still shut off the view, and it was\r\nnot until I reached the summit of one of the lateral hills that I\r\ncould look over and beyond them. Then, for the first time, I saw the\r\ngreat plain of Comayagua, at a level some hundreds of feet below us,\r\nspreading away for a distance of forty miles, in a rich succession of\r\nsavannas and cultivated grounds, dotted with villages, and\r\nintersected by dark waving lines of forest, marking the courses of\r\nthe various streams that traverse it like the veins on an out-spread\r\nhand. At its northeastern extremity, its white walls now gleaming\r\nlike silver in the sunlight, and anon subdued and distant under the\r\nshadow of a passing cloud, was the city of Comayagua, unmistakable,\r\nfrom its size, but especially from the imposing mass of its\r\ncathedral, as the principal town of the plain, and the capital of the\r\nRepublic. Circling around this great plain, and, with the exception\r\nof only a narrow opening at its northern extremity, literally\r\nshutting it in like an amphitheatre, is a cincture of mountains,\r\nrising to the height of from three to six thousand feet,--a fitting\r\nframe-work for so grand a picture.\r\n\r\nI returned slowly to the _rancho_, where my companions were preparing\r\nour encampment, and communicated to them the result of my\r\nobservations. Singularly enough, there was no excitement; even H.\r\nforgot to inquire \"what was the price of stock.\" But we took our\r\ndinner in calm satisfaction,--if four _tortillas_, three eggs, six\r\nonions, and a water-melon, the total results of Dolores's foraging\r\nexpedition to the cattle-_hacienda_, equally divided between eight\r\nhungry men, can be called a dinner.\r\n\r\nWe spent the evening, a good part of the night, and the next day\r\nuntil afternoon, in determining our position and altitude, and in\r\nvarious explorations in both directions from the summit. We found\r\nthat we were distant seventy-eight miles in a right line from La\r\nUnion, and (barometrically) 2958 feet above mean-tide in the Pacific.\r\nWe afterwards ascertained that the hut in which we passed the night\r\nis called Rancho Chiquito, and that name was accordingly given to\r\nthis summit, and to the Pass, as distinguished from another break\r\nthrough the mountains, to the westward, which we subsequently\r\ndiscovered and designated as the Pass of Guajoca.\r\n\r\nAfter Rancho Chiquito, the first town which is reached in the plain\r\nof Comayagua, entering it from this direction, is Lamani,--a small\r\nvillage, it is true, but delightfully situated in an open meadow,\r\nrelieved only by fruit-trees and the stems of the _nopal_ or palmated\r\ncactus, which here grows to a gigantic size, frequently reaching the\r\nheight of twenty or thirty feet. The _cabildo_ was in a state of\r\nextreme dilapidation, and we called on the first _alcalde_ for better\r\naccommodations. He took us to the house of the _padre_, who was away\r\nfrom home, and installed us there. It was the best house in the\r\nplace, whitewashed, and painted with figures of trees, men, animals,\r\nand birds, all in red ochre, and in a style of art truly archaic. The\r\n_padre's_ two servants, an old woman and her boy, were the sole\r\noccupants of the establishment, and did not appear at all delighted\r\nto see us. According to their account, there was nothing in the\r\nhouse to eat; they had no _tortillas_, no eggs, no chickens,\r\n_\"absolutamente nada\"_ (absolutely nothing). All this was affirmed\r\nwith the greatest gravity, while a dozen fat fowls were distinctly\r\nvisible through the open doorway, perched, for the night, among the\r\nbare limbs of the _jocote_ trees in the court-yard. I pointed them\r\nout to the old woman, and, producing a handful of silver, told her\r\nthat we were willing to pay for such as we required.\r\n\r\n_\"Pero no puedo venderles_.\" (But I can't sell them.)\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n_\"No puedo\"_\r\n\r\nDolores meantime took a stick, knocked three of the finest from their\r\nperches, and quietly wrung their necks. I expected to see the old\r\ndame swoon away, or at least go off in a paroxysm of tears; but,\r\ninstead of committing any such civilized folly, she silently took up\r\nher slaughtered innocents, dressed and cooked them, and thanked me\r\nprofoundly for the _medio_ each, which I handed her next morning. The\r\nlesson was not lost on us, in our subsequent travels; for we found it\r\nalmost universal, that the lower classes are utterly indisposed to\r\nsell their domestic commodities. Their services may be purchased; but\r\ntheir chickens are above price. When, however, you have helped\r\nyourself, you are astonished to find how ridiculously small a sum\r\nwill heal the wound you have made and atone for the loss you have\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\nFrom Lamani to Comayagua the road is direct, over a slightly\r\nundulating plain, subsiding gently to the north, and traversed nearly\r\nin its centre by the Rio Hanuya, fed by numerous tributaries falling\r\nfrom the mountains on either hand. We forded it at a distance of ten\r\nmiles from Lamani, and were surprised to find it already a large and\r\ndeep stream, frequently impassable for days and weeks together,\r\nduring the season of rains. Half a mile beyond the ford we came to\r\nthe Villa de San Antonio, a considerable place, and, next to the\r\ncapital itself and the town of Las Piedras, the largest in the plain.\r\nHere we stopped at the house of the first _alcalde_, who gave us a\r\ncordial reception, and an ample dinner, in a civilized fashion,--that\r\nis to say, we had veritable plates, and knives and forks withal.\r\n\r\nIn Central America, curiosity is unchecked by our conventional laws,\r\nand the traveller soon ceases to be surprised at any of its\r\nmanifestations, however extraordinary. When, therefore, a couple of\r\ndozen spectators, of all ages and both sexes, invaded the house of\r\nour host, and huddled around us while eating, we were in no degree\r\nastonished, but continued our meal as if unconscious of their\r\npresence. One yellow dame, however, was determined not to be ignored,\r\nand insisted on speaking English, of which she had a vocabulary of\r\nfour or five words, picked up in her intercourse with American\r\nsailors at the port of Truxillo. We were hungry, and did not much\r\nheed her; whereupon she disappeared, as if piqued, but soon returned\r\nwith what she evidently regarded as an irresistible appeal to our\r\ninterest, in the shape of a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired child, perhaps\r\nthree years old, perfectly naked, but which she placed triumphantly\r\non the table before us.\r\n\r\n_\"Mira estos caballeros! son paisanos tuyos, niñito!\"_ (See these\r\ngentlemen, child! they are your countrymen!)\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" ejaculated the brat, to the infinite entertainment of the\r\nspectators, none of whom appeared to discover the slightest\r\nimpropriety in the proceeding.\r\n\r\nOf course, we had not come all the way to the Villa de San Antonio to\r\nset up our standard of what is moral or amusing; so we laughed also,\r\nand asked the mother to give us the history of the phenomenon. It was\r\ngiven without circumlocution; and we learned, in most direct phrase,\r\nthat Captain ---- of ----, who traded to Truxillo, was responsible\r\nfor this early effort towards what H. called \"the enlightenment of\r\nthe country.\" So far from feeling ashamed of her _escapade_ with the\r\nCaptain, the mother gloried in it, and rather affected a social\r\nsuperiority over her less fortunate neighbors, in consequence. It is,\r\nhowever, but right to say, that the freedom with which matters of\r\nthis sort are talked about in Central America does not necessarily\r\nimply that the people at large are less virtuous than in other\r\ncountries. _Honi soit qui mal y pense_ is a motto universally acted\r\non; legs are called legs; and even the most delicate relations and\r\ncomplaints are spoken of and discussed without the slightest attempt\r\nat concealment or periphrasis. It is no doubt true, that marriage is\r\nfar from general among the middle and lower classes; and a woman may\r\nlive with a man in open concubinage without serious detriment to her\r\ncharacter or position, so long as she remains faithful to him.[1] It\r\nis only when she becomes \"light o' love\" and indiscriminate in her\r\nconduct, that she is avoided and despised. And although the remark\r\nmay sound strangely to American ears, I have no question that this\r\nleft-hand compact, on the whole, is here quite as well kept as the\r\nvows which have secured the formal sanction of the law and the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: But few statistics relating to this subject are in\r\nexistence; but those few quite bear out these observations.

But there\r\nare few good biographies extant; the writers, for the most part,\r\ncontenting themselves with superficial facts, refusing or unable to\r\nfollow the mind and motive powers of the subject,--or following these\r\nimperfectly. For this reason, they who would read the truest kind of\r\nbiographies must turn to those written by men of themselves,--that\r\nis, the autobiographies; and these are, in fact, found to be among\r\nthe most attractive specimens of literature in our language, or any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe life of any man is more or less of a mystery to other men, and\r\none who would write it effectively must have been intimate with him\r\nfrom his youth onward. When the biography is that of a man of genius,\r\nthe difficulty is greatly increased, even to the writer who has been\r\nhis life-long familiar; for genius, by the necessity of its being,\r\nimplies a departure in a variety of ways from the thoughts and rules\r\nof that regulated existence which is most favorable to the progress\r\nand welfare of men in the mass,--at least, as these are generally\r\nunderstood. But if the life-long intimacy be wanting in this\r\ninstance, the task of the writer is the most difficult of all, and\r\nalmost always a failure,--save in some rare case, where the writer\r\nand his subject have been men of a similar stamp.\r\n\r\nFew biographies are written by the life-intimates of the dead. In\r\nmost instances they are composed as tasks or duties by comparative\r\nstrangers; or if now and then by the friends or associates of the\r\nsubject, these are very likely the observers of only a part of his\r\nlife, the _seri studiorum_ of his latter or middle career, and\r\nunacquainted with that period when the strong lines of character are\r\nformed and the mental tendencies fixed. Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\"\r\nis considered one of the best performances of its kind in our\r\nlanguage; but it is, after all, only half a biography, as it were. We\r\nhave the pensioned and petted life of the rough and contemptuous man\r\nof genius,--whose great renown in English literature, by-the-by, is\r\nowing far more to that garrulous admirer of his than to his own\r\nworks,--but we have little or nothing about those days of study or\r\nstruggle when he taught and flogged little boys, or felt all the\r\ncontumely excited by his shabby habiliments, or knocked down his\r\npublisher, or slept at night with a hungry stomach on a bulkhead in\r\nthe company of the poor poet Savage. All the racier and stronger part\r\nof the man's history is slurred over. No doubt he would not encourage\r\nany prying into it, and neither cared to remember it himself nor\r\nwished others to do so. He had a sensitive horror of having his life\r\nwritten by an ignorant or unfriendly biographer, and even spoke of\r\nthe justice of taking such a person's life by anticipation, as they\r\ntell us. Others, feeling a similar horror, and some of them conscious\r\nof the enmities they should leave behind them, have themselves\r\nwritten the obscurer portions of their own lives, like Hume, Gibbon,\r\nGifford, Scott, Moore, Southey. These men must have felt, that, even\r\nat best, and with the fairest intentions, the task of the biographer\r\nis full of difficulties, and open to mistakes, uncertainties, and\r\nfalse conclusions without number.\r\n\r\nThe autobiographies are the best biographies. No doubt, self-love and\r\nsome cowardly sensitiveness will operate on a man in speaking of his\r\nown doings; but all such drawbacks will still leave his narrative far\r\nmore trustworthy, as regards the truth of character, than that of any\r\nother man: and this is more emphatically the case in proportion to\r\nthe genius of the writer; for genius is naturally bold and true, the\r\nantipodes of anything like hypocrisy, and prone to speak out,--if it\r\nwere but in defiance of hatred or misrepresentation, even though the\r\nbetter and more philosophic spirit were wanting. We should have\r\nbetter and more instructive autobiographies, if distinguished men\r\nwere not deterred by the self-denying ordinance so generally\r\naccepted, that it is not becoming in any one to speak frankly of\r\nhimself or his own convictions. We have no longer any of the strong,\r\nwayward egotists,--the St. Augustines, the Montaignes, the Rousseaus,\r\nthe Mirabeaus, the Byrons; even the Cobbetts have died out. But the\r\nCarlyles and the Emersons preserve amongst us still the evidences of\r\na stronger time.\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of biographies, which may be described, in a\r\nrough way, as biographies of thought and biographies of action. It\r\nmay not be a very difficult thing, perhaps, to write the life of a\r\npolitician or a general, or even of a statesman or a great soldier.\r\nAt any rate, the history of such a one is an easy matter, compared\r\nwith that of a mere man of thought, of a man of genius. In the former\r\ncase, we have the marked events, which are, as it were, the\r\nstepping-stones of biography,--events belonging to the narrative of the\r\ntime,--and the individual receives a reflected light from many men\r\nand things. Dates and facts make the task of statement or commentary\r\nmore easy to the writer, and his work more interesting to the general\r\nreader. But the case of the mere thinker, the man of inaction, whose\r\nsphere of achievement is for the most part a little room, and who\r\nproduces his effects in a great measure in silence or solitude, is a\r\nvery different one. The names of his publications, the dates of them,\r\nthe number of them, the publisher's price for them, the critic's\r\nopinion of them, are meagre facts for the biographer; and if the man\r\nof genius be a man of quiet, sequestered life, the record of it will\r\nbe only the more uninteresting to the reader. It is only when\r\nsomething painful has been suffered, something eccentric done and\r\nmisunderstood and denounced or derided, that the biography rouses the\r\nlanguid interest of the public. Indeed, so imperfect and false are\r\nthe plan and style of the literary biographies, that such opprobria\r\nare, as it were, necessary to them,--necessary stimulants of\r\nattention, and necessary shades of what would otherwise be a\r\nmonotonous and ineffective picture; and thus the unlucky men of\r\nletters suffer posthumously for the stupidity of others as well as\r\ntheir faults or divergencies. When biographers have not facts, they\r\nare not unwilling to make use of fallacies: they set down \"elephants\r\nfor want of towns.\" Dean Swift is a case in point. Society has\r\navenged itself by calumniating the man who spat upon its hypocrisies\r\nand rascalities; and to appease the wounded feelings of the world, he\r\nis attractively set down as a savage and a tyrant. Mr. Thackeray and\r\nothers find such a verdict artistically suitable to their criticisms\r\nor their narratives, (a French author has written a romantic book\r\nabout the Dean and Stella,) and so the man is still depicted and\r\nexplained as the slayer of two poor innocent women, a sort of\r\nclerical Bluebeard, and the horrid ogre who proposed to kill and eat\r\nthe fat Irish babies. Thackeray's plan of dissertation, indeed, was\r\ninconsistent with any displacing or disturbing of the preconceived\r\nnotions; the success of it was, on the contrary, to be built upon the\r\ncustomary old impressions of the subject. Everybody is pleased to\r\nfind his own idea in Thackeray, liking it all the better for the\r\ngraphic way in which it is set forth and illustrated; and the result\r\nshows the shrewd artistic judgment of the critic, who apparently\r\n(especially in the Dean's case) understands his readers rather better\r\nthan his theme. As for Swift,--though a fair knowledge of the man may\r\nbe gleaned from the several biographies of him that we have, his life\r\nhas not yet been fairly written and interpreted; and we believe the\r\nsame may be said of most literary men of genius.\r\n\r\nIt must certainly be said of Shelley,--and this brings us to the\r\nbeginning of our remarks. Not one man in ten thousand would be\r\ncapable of writing the life of that poet as it should be\r\nwritten,--even supposing the biographer were one of his intimate friends.\r\nShelley went entirely away from the ranks of society,--farther away\r\nthan Byron, and was a man harder to be understood by the generality\r\nof men. An autobiography of such a man was more needed than that of\r\nany other; but we could not expect an autobiography from Shelley. He\r\nfelt nothing but pain and sorrow in the retrospect of his life, and,\r\nlike Byron, shrank from the task of explaining the mixture of self-will,\r\ninjustice, falsehood, and impetuous defiance that made up the\r\ngreater part of his history; and when he died, he left everything at\r\nsixes and sevens, as regarded his place and acts in the world.\r\nAccordingly, until lately, no one ventured forward with a biography\r\nof the departed poet, who has been for more than a generation looked\r\non, as it were, through the medium of two lights: one, that of his\r\npoetry, which represents him as the loftiest and gentlest of minds;\r\nand the other, the imperfect notices of his life, which show him\r\nforth a cruel, headstrong, and reckless outlaw,--hooted at,\r\nanathematized, (and by his own father first,) driven out, like a\r\nleper in the Middle Ages, and deprived of the care of his children.\r\nIn his case, however, the tendency to dwell upon and bring out the\r\ndarker traits of biography does not exhibit itself in any remarkable\r\nway; and, on the whole, Shelley's character wears a mild and retiring\r\nrather than a defiant or fiendish aspect. The world is inclined to\r\nmake allowances for him, on account of his beautiful poetry; and this\r\nis something of the justice which, on other grounds also, is probably\r\ndue to him. Still, nobody has come forward to write his biography as\r\nit should be written; and we are yet to seek for the illustrated\r\nmoral of a sensitive, unaccommodating, and impulsive being, rebelling\r\nagainst the rules of life and the general philosophy of his\r\nfellow-creatures, and shrinking with a shy, uncomprehended pride from the\r\ncompanionship of society. Shelley's disposition was a marked and rare\r\none, but there is nothing of the riddle in it; for thousands, of his\r\ntemperament, may always be found going strangely through the world,\r\nhere and there, and the interpretation of such a character could be\r\nmade extremely interesting, and even instructive, by any one capable\r\nof comprehending it.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable interval, some notices of Shelley have appeared,\r\nwithout, however, throwing much additional light on the wayward heart\r\nand pilgrimage of the poet. Mr. C.S. Middleton has published a book\r\nupon Shelley and his writings; Mr. T.J. Hogg has given a sketch of\r\nhis life; and E.J. Trelawny some recollections of him, as well as of\r\nByron. None of these pretends to explain that eccentric nature, or\r\nharmonize in any way his acts and his feelings; though a few things\r\nmay be gathered that tend to make the biography somewhat more\r\ndistinct than before, in some particulars. On the subject of his\r\nfirst unfortunate marriage, we are made aware that his wife was a\r\nself-willed, ill-taught young woman, who set her own father at\r\ndefiance, and threw herself on the protection of such a wandering\r\noddity as Percy Shelley. She was strong-minded, and brought with her\r\ninto her husband's house her elder sister, also strong-minded, a\r\nridiculous and insufferable duenna, whom Shelley hated with all\r\nhis heart and soul, and wished dead and buried out of his\r\nsight,--finding, no doubt, his unsteady disposition controlled and\r\nthwarted by the voice and authority of his sister-in-law, who, knowing\r\nthat her father furnished the young couple with their chief means of\r\nlivelihood, would be all the more resolute in advising them or\r\ndomineering over the migratory household. At last, these women grew\r\ntired of the moping and ineffectual youth who still remained poor and\r\nunsettled, with a father desperately healthy and inexorable, and all\r\nhope of the baronetcy very far off indeed; they grew tired of him and\r\nwent away,--the wife, like Lady Byron, refusing to go back to such an\r\naimless, rhapsodizing vagabond. With her natural decision of mind,\r\naided and encouraged, very likely, by her astute relatives, she\r\nthought she saw good reasons for breaking and setting aside the\r\ncontract which had united them; and no doubt the poor woman must have\r\nfelt the hardship of living with such a melancholy outlaw. Having\r\nnothing in common with the devoted Emma, drawn in the ballad of \"The\r\nNut-brown Maid,\" she must have hated that wandering about from, place\r\nto place, living in lonely country-houses, under perpetual terror of\r\nrobbers in the night, and subsisting for the most part on potatoes\r\nand Platonism; and she must have especially hated the Latin Grammar.\r\nShe naturally thought, that, when she was married, she should have\r\nnothing more to say to exercises and lessons; but she found a\r\npedagogue in Shelley, and the honeymoon saw her \"attacking Latin\" for\r\nthe purpose of construing the poet Horace. How she must have hated\r\nall poets! She had other ideas,--ideas of ease, respectability,\r\nbaronetcy; and her disappointment was greater than she could bear.\r\nMr. Hogg says, she had a propensity to strong courses, and would talk\r\nof suicide in a speculative way. It is not difficult to discover the\r\ntruth of that unfortunate union and disunion. Shelley, betrayed by\r\nthe impulses of his enthusiast nature and the ignorant and deplorable\r\ncredulity of a bookworm, allowed himself to be imposed upon by a\r\ndesigning boarding-school girl and her relatives, and everything\r\nfollowed as a matter of course. The unhappy wife recklessly broke the\r\nbond which she had as recklessly formed, and which the poet would\r\nhave honorably and truly respected all his life; and then her\r\npassionate regret reacted fatally on herself,--and on him also, by a\r\nNemesis not so very strange or unnatural, as the world goes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since this article was written, Mr. Peacock, an early\r\nfriend of Shelley, has published a very different estimate of the\r\ncharacter of Harriet Shelley. See _Fraser's Magazine_ for March,\r\n1860.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of Shelley's character is a delicate and a difficult one,\r\nand Mr. Hogg and Mr. Trelawny, especially, show their inability to\r\nunderstand it, by the way in which they put forward and dwell upon\r\nthe poet's peculiarities. Trelawny, a hard-minded, thorough-paced man\r\nof the world, publishing garrulously in his old age what he was\r\nsilent about in his better period, talks of the poet's oddity,\r\nawkwardness, and want of punctuality,--as if Percy were some clerkly\r\nman on 'Change; and Hogg, hilariously clever, says Shelley was so\r\nerratic, fragmentary, and unequal, that his character cannot be shown\r\nin any way but as the figures of a magic-lantern are shown on a\r\nwall,--Mr. Hogg's own style of description being the wall,--\"O wall,\r\nO wall, O sweet and lovely wall!\" He also tells us, to instance the\r\npoet's familiarity with the sex, a story of Shelley sitting with one\r\nof his lady friends and being plied with cups of tea by that fair\r\nsympathizer,--the poet talking and letting his saucer fall, and the\r\nlady wiping his perspiring face with a pocket-handkerchief. Such\r\nscraps of silly gossip are not biography; they may do for tea-table\r\nchit-chat, but show very feebly in the place where one looks for\r\nsomething like a philosophical criticism on the mind of so\r\nextraordinary a man as Shelley.\r\n\r\nGenius alone can do justice to genius; and kindred genius alone will\r\ndo it. There have been, no doubt, a great many writers of biography\r\nwho had no objection to compensate their feelings for bygone slights\r\nor discourtesies, suffered from some wayward or inattentive\r\nsuperiority, some stroke of ridicule or malice. Literary antipathies\r\ndo not die with the dead. The posthumous impression of Margaret\r\nFuller Ossoli has been colored by some who sneer at her ways and\r\npretensions, because there was probably something in her manner which\r\ndispleased them in a personal way. She had certainly a very awkward\r\nfashion of blinking her eyes, and also \"a mountainous _me_.\" It is\r\nvery probable poor Edgar Poe has had his faults exaggerated by those\r\nwho suffered from the critical superiority of his intellect; since\r\nsome of those notices of him which tend most to fix his character as\r\na reprobate, and appear in a laggard way in the English periodicals,\r\nwere probably written by some of his own countrymen. It was a painful\r\nconsciousness of this literary revenge that made H.W. Herbert, in his\r\nlast agony, call on his brother-penmen for mercy on his remains, and\r\nthat induces many of our public men to bring out their own memoirs or\r\nencourage others to do so. It looks like vainglory, but it is\r\nnot such. The memoirs show a mortal dread of calumny or\r\nmisrepresentation. Mr. Barnum, for instance, was more just to himself\r\nthan anybody else would be. He showed that his doings were only of a\r\npiece with those of thousands around him in society; and this not\r\nunreasonable extenuation is one that few of his critics are apt to\r\nmake use of in commenting on him and his dexterities of living. As\r\nfor Shelley, he might have shunned or slighted or overlooked Mr.\r\nTrelawny in some painful or preoccupied moment, or offended the\r\nrobust man of the world by the mere delicate shyness of his look; he\r\nmight also have puzzled and bewildered Mr. Hogg, being, perhaps,\r\npuzzled and bewildered himself, by some subtile mental\r\nspeculation,--unconscious that for these things he was yet to be brought\r\nto judgment and turned into ridicule, for the coming generation, by\r\nthese familiar men,--these drilled and pipe-clayed familiar men. He\r\nmight have tossed up a paradox or two to keep the muscles of his mind\r\nin exercise on a cold day, and his rapid intellect may have run away\r\nfrom his hearer, trampling on the conventions and platitudes in its\r\ncourse; but Mr. Hogg does not think he had fixed notions concerning\r\nanything. The poet did not nail his colors with a cheer to the mast\r\nof any of the great questions of the day, ethical or social, and\r\ntherefore suffered the disparagements of those intelligent friends of\r\nhis who have been taught to consider a well-defined rigidity of\r\nconviction and maintenance, in the midst of all these phenomena of\r\nour universe, telluric and uranological, as the test of everything\r\nvaluable in human character and morals. And thus it has come about,\r\nthat genius, with its native instincts of reason, truth, and common\r\nsense, is doomed to pay the penalty of its preëminence and its\r\ndivergencies, and suffer at the hands of friends and enemies alike,\r\nfrom the show of those false appearances, insincerities,\r\nequivocations, which are its natural and proper antipathies.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing observations were written, the writer has seen a\r\ncertain corroboration of them in the interesting \"Memorials of\r\nShelley,\" recently edited by Lady Shelley, and published by Ticknor\r\nand Fields. For, in the preface of this book, she takes occasion to\r\nspeak of the misstatements of all those who have hitherto written on\r\nthe subject of the poet, instancing the fallacies of Captain Medwin's\r\nbook, and also, in an especial manner, though vaguely enough, the\r\nincorrectness, amounting to caricature, put forth by a later\r\nbiographer, one of Shelley's oldest friends,--by which she evidently\r\nmeans to indicate Mr. Hogg. At the same time, the nature of her\r\nLadyship's book is, involuntarily, an additional evidence of the\r\ndifficulty that seems fated to attend all attempts to set forth or\r\nset right the character of Shelley. Indeed, she appears to be in some\r\ndegree conscious of this; for she says, apologetically, that she has\r\npublished the \"Memorials\" for the special purpose of neutralizing the\r\nmisstatements and spirit of Mr. Hogg's work, and also lets us know\r\nthat the time is not yet come for the publication of other and more\r\nimportant matter calculated to do justice to the character of Percy\r\nBysshe Shelley.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural to think that Lady Shelley is not the person to\r\nwrite the biography of the poet, whose relationship to her is such a\r\nclose one. She would far more willingly leave the events of his\r\ntroubled life forever unremembered. Indeed, when we find, that, in\r\nher long widowhood of thirty years, Mrs. Shelley shrank from the task\r\nof writing the life of her husband, we can the more easily understand\r\nwhy any member of his family, especially a lady, should be the most\r\nunfit to undertake the task. Nobody could expect Lady Shelley to\r\nenter into those painful explanations necessary to it. Accordingly,\r\nin the work before us, we do not find any light thrown on those\r\nplaces where a person would be most anxious to see it. Lady Shelley\r\nslurs over the undutiful boyhood of the poet and the terrible\r\nsternness of his Mirabeau-father. She merely glances across the first\r\nfoolish marriage and the catastrophe that closed it, as a bird flies\r\nover an abyss. On such subjects she cannot set about contradicting\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nBut it is an ungrateful task to go on speaking of short-comings in a\r\ncase like this, where the hardest critic in the world must sympathize\r\nwith the feelings of the author, whatever becomes of the book. And\r\nyet the book will be very welcome to every one who regards it as a\r\nfeminine offering of tender admiration and grief laid upon the grave\r\nof departed genius. Though not exactly the sort of personal history\r\none would wish for from another hand, it is still valuable, as\r\nfurnishing very interesting matter for a future biography. We have in\r\nit several new letters of Shelley's, some letters of Godwin's, and\r\nothers of Mrs. Shelley's, together with a number of touching extracts\r\nfrom the diary of the latter. There are also two papers from the\r\npoet's pen: one an \"Address to Lord Ellenborough\" in defence of a man\r\npunished for having published Paine's \"Age of Reason,\" and another an\r\n\"Essay on Christianity.\" In the first, with all a boy's enthusiasm,\r\nhe opposes the high abstract logic of truth and toleration to the\r\nhard government policy which tries to keep a reckless kind of\r\nsemi-civilization in order, and cannot bring itself to believe, that, as\r\nyet, the broad principle of license is the one that can serve the\r\ncosmogony best. In the next he rather surprises the reader by\r\nexhibiting himself as the eulogist and expounder of Jesus\r\nChrist,--but not after the manner of Saint Paul. No doubt, the secular\r\nand semi-pagan tone of this dissertation will jar against the orthodoxy\r\nof a great many readers,--to whom, however, it will be interesting as\r\na literary curiosity. But it is meant to show the character of\r\nShelley in a more amiable light than that in which it is contemplated\r\nby the generality of people.\r\n\r\nTo explain Percy Bysshe Shelley, by telling us he was inconsequent,\r\nabsurd, and odd in his manners, is as futile as to explain him by\r\nsaying he was a strange, wonderful genius, of the Platonic or\r\nPythagorean order, always soaring above the atmosphere of common men.\r\nTo call a man of genius an inspired idiot or an inspired oddity is an\r\neasy, but false way of interpreting him. The truth of Shelley's\r\ncharacter may be found by a more matter-of-fact investigation. He was\r\nnaturally of a feeble constitution from childhood, and not addicted\r\nto the amusements of stronger boys; hence he became shy, and, when\r\nbullied or flouted by the others, sensitive and irritable, and given\r\nto secret reading and study, instead of play with those \"little\r\nfiends that scoffed incessantly.\" These habits gave him the name of\r\nan oddity, and what is called a \"Miss Molly,\" and the persecution\r\nthat followed only made him more recluse and speculative, and\r\ndisgusted with the ways and feelings of others. He began to have\r\nthoughts beyond his years, and was happy to think he had, in these, a\r\ncompensation for what he suffered from his schoolfellows. With his\r\nhermit habits grew naturally a strong egotistical vanity, which he\r\ncould as little repress as the other youths could repress their\r\nmuscular propensities to exercise; and hence his eagerness to set\r\nforth the threadbare heretical theories he had found among his books.\r\nFor supporting these with an insolent show of importunity, he was\r\nturned away from college, and soon left his father's home, with his\r\nfather's curse to bear him company. Had the baronet been in the way\r\nof a _lettre de cachet_, like Mirabeau's father, he would certainly\r\nhave had Percy put into Newgate and kept there.\r\n\r\nThe malediction of the old man seems to have clung to Shelley's mind\r\nto the end, and made him rebellious against everything bearing the\r\npaternal name. He assailed the Father of the Hebrew theocracy with\r\namazing bitterness, and joined Prometheus in cursing and dethroning\r\nZeus, the Olympian usurper. With him, tyrant and father were\r\nsynonymous, and he has drawn the old Cenci, in the play of that name,\r\nwith the same fierce, unfilial pencil, dipped in blood and wormwood.\r\nShelley was by nature, self-instruction, and inexperience of life,\r\nimpatient and full of impulse; and the sharp and violent measures by\r\nwhich they attempted to reclaim him only exasperated him the more\r\nagainst everything respected by his opponents and persecutors. Genius\r\nis by nature aggressive or retaliatory; and the young poet, writhing\r\nand laughing hysterically, like Demogorgon, returned the scorn of\r\nsociety with a scorn, the deeper and loftier in the end, that it grew\r\ncalm and became the abiding principle of a philosophic life. It was\r\nthe act of his father which drove Shelley into such open rebellion\r\nagainst gods and men. Very probably, though he might have lived an\r\ninfidel in religious matters, like tens of thousands of his fellows,\r\nhe would not have written, or, at least, published, such shocking\r\nthings, if his father had been more patient with a youth so\r\norganized. But parents have a right to show a terrible anger when\r\nthwarted by their children, and in this case the father too much\r\nresembled the son in wilful impetuosity of temper. Turned out of his\r\nfirst home, Shelley went wandering forth by land and sea,--a reed\r\nshaken by the wind, a restless outcast yearning for repose and human\r\nsympathy, and in this way encountering the questionable accidents of\r\nhis troubled, unguarded life, and gathering all the feverish\r\ninspiration of his melancholy and unfamiliar poetry.\r\n\r\nWith a sense of physical infirmity or defect which shaped the\r\nsequestered philosophy of the Cowpers, the Bérangers, and others, the\r\nmanlier minds of literature, including Byron himself, in some\r\nmeasure, Shelley felt he was not fit for the shock and hum of men and\r\nthe greater or lesser legerdemain of life, and so turned shyly away\r\nto live and follow his plans and reveries apart, after the law of his\r\nbeing, violating in this way what may be called the common law of\r\nsociety, and meeting the fate of all nonconformists. He was slighted\r\nand ridiculed, and even suspected; for people in general, when they\r\nsee a man go aside from the highway, maundering and talking to\r\nhimself, think there must be a reason for it; they suppose him\r\ninsane, or scornful, or meditating a murder,--in any case, one to be\r\nvisited with hard thoughts; and thus baffled curiosity will grow\r\nuneasily into disgust, and into calumny, if not into some species of\r\noutrage,--and very naturally, after all; for man is, on the whole,\r\nmade for society, and society has a sovereign right to take\r\ncognizance of him, his ways and his movements, as a matter of\r\nnecessary _surveillance_.\r\n\r\nThe world will class men \"in its coarse blacks and whites.\" Some mark\r\nShelley with charcoal, others with chalk,--the former considering him\r\na reprobate, the latter admiring him as a high-souled lover of human\r\nhappiness and human liberty. But he was something of both\r\ntogether,--and would have been nothing without that worst part of him.\r\nHe ran perversely counter to the lessons of his teachers, and acted in\r\ndefiance of the regular opinions and habits of the world. He was too\r\nout-spoken, like all genius; whereas the world inculcates the high\r\npractical wisdom of a shut mouth and a secretive mind. Fontenelle,\r\nspeaking according to the philosophy of the crowd, says, \"A wise man,\r\nwith his fist full of truths, would open only his little finger.\"\r\nShelley opened his whole hand, in a fearless, unhappy manner; and was\r\naccordingly punished for ideas which multitudes entertain in a quiet\r\nway, saying nothing, and living in the odor of respectable opinion.\r\nWith a mind that recoiled from anything like falsehood and injustice,\r\nhe wanted prudence. And as, in the belief of the matter-of-fact\r\nRomans, no divinity is absent, if _Prudentia_ be present, so it still\r\nseems that everything is wanting to a man, if he wants that. Shelley\r\ndenied the commonly received Divinity, as all the world knows,--an\r\nAtheist of the most unpardonable stamp,--and has suffered in\r\nconsequence; his life being considered a life of folly and vagary,\r\nand his punishment still enduring, as we may perceive from the tone\r\nand philosophy of his biographers, or rather his critics, who, not\r\nbeing able to comprehend such a simple savage, present his character\r\nas an oddity and a wonder,--an _extravaganza_ that cannot be\r\nunderstood without some wall of the world's pattern and plastering to\r\nshow it up against.\r\n\r\nIt is, to be sure, much easier and safer to regard Shelley's career\r\nin this way than to justify it, since the customs and opinions of the\r\ngreat majority must, after all, be the law and rule of the world.\r\nShelley's apologist would be a bold man. Whether he shall ever have\r\none is a question. At all events, he has not had a biographer as yet.\r\nHis widow shrank from the task. Of those familiar friends of his, we\r\ncan say that \"no man's thought keeps the roadway better than theirs,\"\r\nand all to show how futile is the attempt to measure such a man with\r\nthe footrule of the conventions. Shelley was a mutineer on board\r\nship, and a deserter from the ranks; and he must, therefore, wait for\r\na biographer, as other denounced and daring geniuses have waited for\r\ntheir audience or their epitaph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARIAN'S PICTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGEND OF NASSAU HALL.\r\n\r\n\"Turbine raptus ingenii.\"--Scaliger\r\n\r\n[concluded.]\r\n\r\nThe next morning there was queer talk about Clarian. Mac and I stared\r\nat each other when we heard it at breakfast, but still kept our own\r\ncounsel in silence. Some late walkers had met him in the moonlight,\r\ncrossing the campus at full speed, hatless, dripping wet, and flying\r\nlike a ghost.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" said our informant, a good enough fellow, and one not\r\nprone to be violently startled, \"he scared me, as he flitted past.\r\nHis eyes were like saucers, his hair wet and streaming behind him,\r\nhis face white as a chalk-mark on Professor Cosine's blackboard.\r\nDepend on it, that boy's either going mad or has got into some\r\ndesperate scrape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" growled Mac, \"you were drunk,--couldn't see straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Innocence was returning from some assignation, I suspect\",\r\nremarked Zoile.\r\n\r\n\"If he had been, _you'd_ have encountered him, Mr. Zoile,\" said Mac,\r\ncurtly.\r\n\r\nBut I noticed my chum did not like this new feature in the case.\r\n\r\nAfter this, until the time of my receiving the lad's invitation, I\r\nneither saw nor had communication with Clarian, nor did any others of\r\nus. If he left his room, it was solely at night; he had his meals\r\nsent to him, under pretence of illness, and admitted no one, except\r\nhis own servant. This fellow, Dennis, spoke of him as looking\r\nexceedingly feeble and ill; and also remarked that he had apparently\r\nnot been to bed for some days, but was mixing colors, or painting,\r\nthe whole time. I went to his door several times; but was invariably\r\nrefused admittance, and told, kindly, but firmly, that he would not\r\nbe interrupted. Mac also tried to see him, but in vain.\r\n\r\n\"I caught a glimpse of that boy's face at his window just now,\" said\r\nhe, one day, coming in after recitation. \"You may depend upon it,\r\nthere's something terribly wrong. My God, I was horrified, Ned! Did\r\nyou ever see any one drown? No? Well, I did once,--a woman. She fell\r\noverboard from a Chesapeake steamboat in which I was coming up the\r\nBay, and sank just before they reached her. I shall never forget her\r\nlooks as she came up the last time, turned her white, despairing,\r\ndeath-stricken face towards us, screamed a wild nightmare scream, and\r\nwent down. Clarian's face was just like hers. Depend upon it, there's\r\nsomething wrong. What can we do?\"\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, save what we did,--wait, until that pleasant morning\r\ncame round and brought me Clarian's note. I could scarcely brook the\r\nslow laziness with which the day dragged by, as if it knew its own\r\nbeauty, and lingered to enjoy it. At last, however, the night came,\r\nthe hour also, and punctually with it came Dr. Thorne, a kindly\r\nyoung physician, and a man of much promise, well-read, prompt,\r\nclear-headed, resourceful, and enthusiastically attached to his profession\r\nMac tucked a volume of Shakspeare under his arm, and we made our way\r\nto Clarian's room forthwith. Here we found about a dozen students,\r\nall known to us intimately. They were seated close to one another,\r\nconversing in low tones, and betraying upon their faces quite an\r\nanxiety of expectation. The door of the bedroom was closed, the\r\ncurtain was lowered, and the only light in the room came from a\r\nshaded lamp, which was placed upon a small table in the recess to the\r\nright of the picture.\r\n\r\n\"What is this for?\" inquired Dr. Thorne, pointing to a sort of salver\r\nresting upon a low tripod directly in front of the picture.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Clarian?\" asked I.\r\n\r\n\"He looks awful,\" someone began in a whisper, when the lad's feeble\r\nvoice called out from the bedroom,--\r\n\r\n\"Is it Ned and Mac?\"\r\n\r\nThe door was pulled open, and Clarian came towards us.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you, my friends. Dr. Thorne, you are truly welcome.\r\nPray, be seated. Mac, here is your place, you and your Shakspeare,\"\r\nsaid he, indicating the chair and table in the recess.\r\n\r\nI had held out my hand to the lad, but he turned away without taking\r\nit, and began to adjust the cords that moved the curtain.\r\n\r\n\"The tripod, Dr. Thorne,\" said he, with a sickly smile, \"is a--a mere\r\nfancy of mine,--childish,--but in the salver I shall burn some\r\npyrotechnic preparations, while the picture is being exhibited, by\r\nway of substitute for daylight. Excuse me a moment,\" added he, as he\r\nwent into the bedroom again.\r\n\r\n\"Blount,\" said Dr. Thorne, in my ear, \"why have you permitted this?\r\nWhat ails that boy? If he is not cared for soon, he will go crazy.\r\nHush!--here he comes,--keep your eye on him.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Clarian came out, and stood in the bedroom doorway, quite\r\nnear me, I remarked the terrible change since I had last seen him. He\r\nleaned against the door-frame, as if too weak to support himself\r\nerect; and I saw that his knees shook, his hands jerked, and his\r\nmouth twitched in a continual nervous unrest. He had on a handsome\r\n_robe de chambre_ of maroon velvet, which he seldom wore about\r\ncollege, though it was very becoming to him, its long skirts falling\r\nnearly to his feet, while its ample folds were gathered about his\r\nwaist, and secured with cord and tassel. His feet were thrust into\r\nneat slippers, and his collar rolled over a flowing black cravat _à\r\nla Corsaire_. His long hair, which was just now longer than usual,\r\nwas evenly parted in the middle, like a girl's, and, combed out\r\nstraight, fell down to his shoulders on either side. All this care\r\nand neatness of dress made the contrast of his face stand out the\r\nmore strikingly. Its pallor was ghastly: no other word conveys the\r\nidea of it. His lips kept asunder, as we see them sometimes in\r\npersons prostrated by long illness, and the nether one quivered\r\nincessantly, as did the smaller facial muscles near the mouth. His\r\neyes were sunken and surrounded by livid circles, but they themselves\r\nseemed consuming with the dry and thirsty fire of fever: hot, red,\r\nstaring, they glided ever to and fro with a snake-like motion, as\r\nuncertain, wild, and painful, in their unresting search, as those of\r\na wounded and captive hawk. The same restlessness, approaching in\r\nviolence the ceaseless spasmodic habit of a confirmed Chorea,\r\nbetrayed itself in all his movements, particularly in a way he had of\r\nglancing over his shoulder with a stealthy look of apprehension, and\r\nthe frequent starts and shivers that interrupted him when talking.\r\nHis voice also was changed, and in every way he gave evidence not\r\nonly of disease of mind and body, but of a nervous system shattered\r\nalmost beyond hope of reaction and recovery. Trembling for him, I\r\nrose and attempted to speak with him aside, but he waived me off,\r\nsaying, with that sickly smile which I had never before seen him\r\nwear,--\r\n\r\n\"No, Ned,--you must not interrupt me to-night, neither you nor the\r\nrest,--for I am very weak and nervous and ill, and just now need all\r\nmy strength for my picture, which, as it has cost me labor and\r\npain,--much pain,--I wish to show in its best light. Macbeth's\r\nterror--it means more than it did the other night, Ned--but\"--\r\n\r\nHere he murmured an inarticulate word or two, recovering himself\r\nalmost instantly, however, and resuming in a stronger voice,--\r\n\r\n\"Macbeth's doom is my picture. You will wonder I preferred the solid\r\nwall to canvas, perhaps,--but so did the genuine old artists. Lippo\r\nLippi, and Giotto, and--why, Orcagna painted on graveyard walls; and\r\nI can almost fancy, sometimes, that this room is a vault, a tomb, a\r\ndungeon, where they torture people. Turn to the place, good Mac,\r\nShakespeare's tragedy of 'Macbeth,' Act Third, Scene Fourth, and read\r\nthe scene to us, as you know how to read; I will manage the\r\naccompaniments.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he touched the salver with a lighted match, so that a\r\nblue alcoholic flame flickered up before the curtain, making the poor\r\nlad's face seem more ghastly than ever.\r\n\r\n\"You must sit down, Clarian,\" cried Dr. Thorne, resolutely.\r\n\r\nClarian smiled again, that dim, uncertain smile, and answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Doctor, let me have my own way for an hour, and after that you\r\nshall govern me as your learned skill suggests. And do not be uneasy\r\nabout my 'creamfaced' aspect, as I see Ned is: there is plentiful\r\ncause for it, beyond the feebleness of this very present, and\r\nto-night is not the first time I have worn these 'linen cheeks.' Read\r\non, Mac.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat there in the dim light, breathless, awed,--for all of us saw\r\nthe boy's agony, and were the more shocked that we were unable to\r\nunderstand it,--until, at last, in a voice made more impressive by\r\nits tremor, Mac began to read the terrible text,--to read as I had\r\nnever heard him read before, until a fair chill entered our veins and\r\nran back to our shuddering hearts from sympathy. Then, as he read on\r\nand painted the king and murderer together, while his voice waxed\r\nstronger and fuller, we saw Clarian step forward to the salver and\r\nbusy with its lambent flame, till it blazed up with a broad, red\r\nlight, that, shedding a weird splendor upon all around, and lending a\r\nsupernatural effect to the room's deep shadows, the picture's\r\nfunereal aspect, and the unearthly pallor of the boy's countenance,\r\nstartled our eyes like the painful glare of midnight lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Thou canst not say, I did it! Never shake Thy gory locks at me!\"\r\n\r\nAs the reader thrust the terror of these words upon us, all started\r\nback, for the curtain was plucked suddenly away, and there before us,\r\nnot in Clarian's picture, it seemed, but in very truth, stood\r\nMacbeth, conscious of the murdered presence. Even the reader,\r\nabsorbed as he was in his text, paused short, amazed; and I forgot\r\nthat I had seen this picture, only knew that it was a living scene of\r\nterror. Doubtless much of this startling effect was the result of\r\nassociation, the agitation of anxiety, the influence of the\r\nimpressive text, the suddenness of the apparition, the unusual light;\r\nbut in the figure of Macbeth, at which alone we gazed, there was a\r\nlife, a terrible significance, that outran all these causes. It was\r\nnot in the posture, grand as that was,--not in the sin-stamped brow,\r\nrough with wrinkles like a storm-chafed sea,--not in the wiry hair,\r\ngray and half rising in haggard locks, like adders that in vain try\r\nto escape the foot that treads them down,--nor in the mouth, for that\r\nwas hid behind the impotent guard of the upraised arm and clenched\r\nfist,--but in those painted eyes, into which, all-fascinated, we ever\r\ngazed, reading in them all that crouching terror, all the punishment\r\nof that spectral presence, all the poignant consciousness of his fate\r\nto whom such things could happen, to whom already his victims rise\r\nagain,\r\n\r\n\"With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our\r\n  stools!\"\r\n\r\nWhile I yet gazed, a sickening terror pervading me in the presence of\r\nthese ghastly eyes, there came a voice, as if from afar,--\"Read\r\non!\"--so consonant with the tone of my emotions, that I looked to see\r\nthe figure itself take speech, until Mac, with a gasp, resumed.\r\nStill, as he read, the nightmare-spell possessed me, till a\r\nconvulsive clutch upon my arm roused me, and instinctively, with the\r\nreturning sense, I turned to Clarian.\r\n\r\nNot too soon,--for then, in his own person, and in that strange\r\nglare, he was interpreting the picture to us. He stood, not thrown\r\nback like Macbeth, but drawn forward, on tiptoe, with neck reached\r\nout, form erect, but lax, one arm extended, and one long diaphanous\r\nfinger pointing over our heads at something he saw behind us, but\r\ntowards which, in the extremity of our terror, we dared not turn our\r\neyes. _He saw it_,--more than saw it,--we knew, as we noted the\r\nscream swelling in his throat, yet dying away into an inarticulate\r\nbreath ere it passed the blue and shaken lips,--he saw it, and those\r\neyes of his, large enough in their wont, waxed larger still, wilder,\r\nmadder with desperate affright, till every one of us, save the\r\nabsorbed reader, recognized in them the nightmare horror of the\r\npicture,--knew that in Macbeth Clarian had drawn his own portrait!\r\nThere he stood, drawn on, staring, pointing--\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" shouted Dr. Thorne, his voice hoarse and strident with\r\nemotion; but Mac, absorbed in his text, still read, flinging a fine\r\nand subtile emotion of scorn into the words,--\r\n\r\n    \"O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear:\r\nThis\"----\r\n\r\n\"Triple fool! be silent!\" cried Dr. Thorne again, springing to his\r\nfeet,--while we, spell-bound, sat still and waited for the end.\r\n\"Cease! do you not see?\" cried he, seizing Mac.\r\n\r\nBut there stood Clarian yet, that red light upon his cheek and brow,\r\nthat fixed stare of a real, unpainted horror in his speechless face,\r\nthat long finger still pointing and trembling not,--there he stood,\r\nfixed, while one might count ten. Then over his blue lips, like a\r\nghost from its tomb, stole a low and hissing whisper, that curdled\r\nour blood, and peopled all the room with dreadful things,--a low\r\nwhisper that said,--\r\n\r\n\"Prithee, see there! behold! it comes! it comes!\" Now he beckoned in\r\nthe air, and called with a shuddering, smothered shriek,--\"Come! I\r\ndid it! come! Ha!\" yelled he, plucking the spell from his limbs like\r\na garment, and springing madly forward towards the door,--\"Ha! touch\r\nme not! Off, I say, off!\" He paused, gazed wildly round, flung his\r\nhand to his brow, and, while his eyes rolled till nothing but their\r\nwhites were seen, while the purple veins swelled like mole-tracks in\r\nhis forehead, and a bubbling froth began to gather about his lips, he\r\ntossed his arms in the air, gave shrieking utterance to the cry,--\"O\r\nChrist! it is gone! it is gone!\" and fell to the floor with a bound.\r\n\r\nWe sprang to him,--Thorne first of any.\r\n\r\n\"This is my place, gentlemen,\" said he, in quick, nervous tones.\r\nThen, taking the prostrate child into his arms, he carried him to his\r\nbed, laid him down, felt his pulse, and placed his head in Mac's\r\narms. Returning then, he veiled the picture, flung the salver out of\r\nthe window, and dismissed the huddled throng of frightened students,\r\nwarning them to be silent as to the night's events. \"Very likely\r\nClarian will never see to-morrow; so be careful, lest you soil his\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean, Thorne?\" asked Mac, as the Doctor and I came\r\nagain to the bedside. \"It is nothing more than an overdose of\r\n_cannabis_ or opium upon an excited nervous system, is it?\"\r\n\r\nThorne looked at the delicate-limbed child who lay there in Mac's\r\nstrong arms, wiped away the gathering froth from the lips, replaced\r\nthe feebly quivering limbs, and, as he lingered over the pulse,\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n\"He has been taking _hashish_?\"\r\n\r\n\"He _has_ taken it,--I do not say he is under its influence now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--he has not touched any stimulant. This is much worse than\r\nthat,--this means epilepsy, Mac, and we may have to choose between\r\ndeath and idiocy.\"\r\n\r\nHe was still examining the boy, and showing Mac how to hold him most\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only get at the _causes_ of this attack,--those, I mean,\r\nwhich lie deeper than the mere physical disorder,--if I could only\r\nfind out what it is he has been doing,--and I could, easily, were I\r\nnot afraid of directing suspicion towards him, or bringing about some\r\nunfortunate embarrassment\"--\r\n\r\n\"What is it you suspect?\" thundered Mac.\r\n\r\n\"Either some cruel trick has been played upon the boy, or he has been\r\nguilty of some act of madness\"--\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" cried we in a breath; \"Clarian is as pure as Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at him, Thorne!\" said my good chum,--\"look at the child's\r\nbaby-face, so frank and earnest!--look at him! You dare not say an impure\r\nthought ever awoke in that brain, an impure word ever crossed those\r\nlips.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Thorne smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\"There is no standard of reason to the enthusiast, my dear Mac; and\r\nhere is one, of a surety. However, time will reveal; I wish I knew.\r\nCome, Ned, help me to mix some medicines here. Be careful to keep his\r\nhead right, Mac, so as to have the circulation as free as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we were occupied in the front room, there came a stout double\r\nknock at the door, and when I opened it, Hullfish, the weather-beaten\r\nold constable of the borough, made his hesitating appearance. The\r\nDoctor gave me a quick glance, as if to say, \"I told you so,\" and\r\nthen returned the old man's bluff salutation. As soon as Hullfish saw\r\nhim, he came forward with something like a sigh of relief, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Doc, you here? 'Tar'n't a hoax, then, though I was mightily\r\n'feared it was. Them students is the Devil for chivying of a\r\nfeller,--beggin' your pardon, Mr. Blount. Have you got him yonder,\r\nDoctor?\" said he, his keen eye noticing Mac and Clarian in the back\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Hullfish? Got whom?\" asked Thorne, making me a\r\nsign to be quiet.\r\n\r\n\"The party, Sir, that was to be copped. I've got a blank warrant\r\nhere, all right, and a pair of bracelets, in case of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fool's errand is this, old man?\" asked the Doctor, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"What! you don't know about it? Lord! p'raps it's a sell, after all,\"\r\nsaid he, quite chopfallen. \"But I've got my pay, anyhow, and there's\r\nno mistake in a V on the Princeton Bank. And here's the papers,\" said\r\nhe, handing a note to the Doctor. \"If that's slum, I'm done, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor glanced at the scrap of paper, then handed it to me,\r\nasking, \"Is that his handwriting?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a note, requiring Mr. Hullfish. to privately arrest a person\r\nguilty of a capital offence, until now concealed. If he was not\r\nbrought to Hullfish's house between nine and ten that night, then\r\nHullfish was to proceed to No.--North College, where he would be\r\ncertain to find the party. The arrest must be made quietly. The\r\nhandwriting was undoubtedly Clarian's, and I told Thorne as much.\r\n\r\n\"You see, gentlemen,\" said Hullfish, \"I wouldn't 'a' taken no notice\r\nof it, ef it hadn't been for the money; but, thinks I, them students\r\na'n't in the habit of sech costly jokes, and maybe there'll be some\r\npinching to do, after all. So you mean to say it's a gam, do you,\r\nDoctor? May I be so bold as to inquire what yonder chap's holding on\r\nto 'tother about?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tother' is dangerously ill,--has a fit, Hullfish. He is the author\r\nof that note,--very probably was out of his mind when he wrote it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So? Pity! Very sick? Mayn't I see him?\"\r\n\r\nBut, as he stepped forward, Thorne stood in the way and effectually\r\nintercepted his view. The constable smiled cunningly, as he drew\r\nback, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"You're sure 'ta'n't nothing else, then? Nobody's been getting rapped\r\non the' head? Didn't see no blood, though,--that's true. Well, I\r\ndon't like to be sold, that's a fact,--but there's no help for it.\r\nHere's the young man's change, Doctor,--warrant sixty-six, my fees\r\none dollar.\"\r\n\r\nThorne carelessly asked if there had been any rows lately,--if he had\r\nheard of any one being hurt,--if they had been quiet recently along\r\nthe canal; and being assured that there had been no disturbance of\r\nmoment,--\"only a little brush between Arch and Long Tobe, down to\r\nGibe's,\"--he handed the money back to Hullfish.\r\n\r\n\"Keep that yourself,--it is yours by rights. And, look you, mum's the\r\nword in this case, for two reasons: there's danger that the poor\r\nlittle fellow there is going to croak before long, and you'd be sorry\r\nto think you'd given trouble to a dead man; and what's more, if the\r\nboys get hold of this, there'll be no end of their chaffing. There's\r\nnot a few of them would like to cook your goose for you,--I needn't\r\ntell you why; so, if you don't want them to get the flashest kind of\r\na pull over you, why, you'll take my advice and keep dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like slang, Ned, with the police or the prigging gentry. It\r\ngives them a wonderful respect for your opinion,\" said the Doctor,\r\nwhen Hullfish was gone. But his serious, almost stern look returned\r\nimmediately, as he continued,--\"Now to solve this mystery, and find\r\nout what this wretched boy has been doing. Come, you and Mac, help me\r\nto understand him.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we had told the Doctor all we knew of the lad, he pondered long\r\nover our recital.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain,\" said he: \"the boy is innocent in intention,\r\nwhatever he has done, and we must stand by him,--you two\r\nparticularly; for you are to blame, if he has got himself into any\r\npredicament.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy has done nothing wrong, Thorne,\" said Mac, sturdily; \"he may\r\nhave been trapped, or got himself involved somehow, but he never\r\ncould have committed any crime capable of superinducing such an\r\nattack as this.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"You may be right, my friend,--and I hope you are, for the child's\r\nsake, for it will certainly kill him, if he has. But I never trust an\r\nintense imagination when morbidly excited, and I have read of some\r\nstrange freaks done by persons under the influence of that infernal\r\n_hashish_. However, trust me, I shall find out what is the matter\r\nbefore long, and bring the boy round nicely. He is improving fast\r\nnow, and all we have to do is to avert another attack.\"\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, in a day or two Clarian was pronounced to be out of\r\ndanger, and promising rapid recovery. We had removed him to our\r\nrooms, as soon as the violence of the convulsion left him, in order\r\nto spare him the associations connected with his own abode. Still,\r\nthe lad continued very weak, and Thorne said he had never seen so\r\nslight an attack followed by such extreme prostration. Then it did my\r\nheart good to see how my chum transformed himself into the tenderest,\r\nthe most efficient of nurses. He laid aside entirely his brusque\r\nmanner, talked in the softest tones, stole noiselessly about our\r\nrooms, and showed all the tender solicitude, all the quiet\r\n\"handiness\" of a gentle woman. I could see that Clarian loved to have\r\nhim at his bedside, and to feel his caressing hand.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Ned,\" Mac would say, in a deprecatory tone that amused me\r\nvastly, \"I really pity the poor little devil, and can't help doing\r\nall in my power for him. He's such a soft little ass,--confound\r\nThorne! he makes me mad with his cursed suspicions!--and then the boy\r\nis out of place here in this rough-and-tumble tiltyard. Reminds me of\r\na delicate wineglass crowded in among a ruck of ale flagons and\r\nbattered quart-cups.\"\r\n\r\nBut, though we rejoiced to see that Clarian's health promised to be\r\nbetter than it had been for months, we did not fail to notice with\r\nregret and apprehension, that, as he grew physically better and\r\nmentally clearer, a darkening cloud settled over his whole being,\r\nuntil he seemed on the point of drowning in the depths of an\r\nirremediable dejection and despair. Besides this, he was ever on the\r\npoint of telling us something, which he yet failed of courage to put\r\ninto words; and Thorne, noticing this, when, one day, we were all\r\nseated round the bed, while the lad fixed his shaded, large, mournful\r\neyes upon us with a painfully imploring look, said suddenly, his\r\nfingers upon Clarian's pulse,--\r\n\r\n\"You have something to say to us,--a confession to make, Clarian.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy flushed and shuddered, but did not falter, as he replied,\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must withhold it until you are well again. I know what it is.\"\r\n\r\nClarian quickly withdrew his hand from the Doctor's grasp.\r\n\r\n\"You know it, and yet here, touching me? Impossible! entirely\r\nimpossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as to that,\" said Thorne, with a cool shrug of the shoulders,\r\n\"you must remember that _our_ relations are simply those of physician\r\nand patient. Other things have nought to do with it. And, as your\r\nphysician, I require you to withhold the matter until you are well\r\nenough to face the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--I must reap where I have sown. I have no right to impose upon\r\nmy friends any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad news travel fast enough, Clarian, and there is no wisdom in\r\nlosing a friend so long as you can retain him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see the force of your reasoning, Dr. Thorne. I have enough\r\nto answer for, without the additional contumely of being called an\r\nimpostor.\"\r\n\r\n\"For your mother's sake, Clarian, I command you to wait. Spare _her_\r\nwhat pain you can, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother! Oh, my God, do not name her! do not name her!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he burst into the only tears I ever saw him shed, hiding his face\r\nin the bed-clothes, and sobbing piteously.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" said Mac, as soon as we were where Clarian\r\ncould not hear us. \"What have you found out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively nothing more than you know already,\" answered Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\" echoed Mac, very indignantly; \"you speak very confidently\r\nfor one having such poor grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mac,\" said Thorne, kindly, \"do you think I am not as much\r\nconcerned about Clarian as you are? Positively, I would give half I\r\nown to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this mystery. But what\r\ncan we do? The boy believes himself a great criminal. Do you not see\r\nat once, that, if we permit him to confess his crime, he will insist\r\nupon taking himself out of our keeping,--commit suicide, get himself\r\nsent to the madhouse, or anyhow lose our care and our soothing\r\ninfluence? We cannot relieve him until we restore his strength and\r\ncomposure. All we can do now is to watch him, soothe him, and by all\r\nmeans stave off this confession until he is stronger. It would kill\r\nhim to face a charge now. I am inquiring quietly, and, if anything\r\nserious has happened, shall be sure to find out his connection with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThough we rebelled against the Doctor's conclusions, we could not but\r\nsee the prudence of the course he advised, and so we sat down to\r\nwatch our poor little friend, gnawed with bitter anxiety, and feeling\r\na sad consciousness that the disease itself under which he suffered\r\nwas beyond our skilfullest surgery, and one that inevitably\r\nthreatened the saddest consequences. A man has grand powers of\r\nrecovery, so long as his _spirit_ is free; but let him once be\r\npersuaded that his soul is chained down forever in adamantine\r\nfetters, and, though, like Prometheus, he may endure with silence,\r\npatience, even divinely, he is nevertheless utterly incapable of any\r\npositive effort towards recuperation. His faith becomes, by a subtile\r\nlaw of our being, his fact; the mountain is gifted with actual\r\nmotion, and rewards the temerity of his zeal by falling upon him and\r\ncrushing him forever. Such a person moves on, perchance, like a deep,\r\nnoble river, in calm and silence, but still moves on, inevitably\r\ndestined to lose himself in the common ocean. And this was the\r\npromise of Clarian's case. Whatever was his hidden woe, however\r\ntrivial its rational results, or baseless its causes, it had beyond\r\nremedy seized upon his soul, and we knew, that, unless it could be\r\ndone away with at the source, the end was certain: first the fury,\r\nthen the apathy of madness. He was no longer tortured with a visible\r\nhaunting presence, such as had borne him down on that fatal night,\r\nbut we saw plainly that he had taken the spectre into his own breast,\r\nand nursed it, as a bosom serpent, upon his rapidly exhausting\r\nenergies.\r\n\r\nHappily for us,--ere Clarian was quite beyond recovery, while Mac\r\nstill tore his hair in rage at his own impotence, while the Doctor\r\nstill pursued his researches with the sedateness of a philosopher,\r\nand I was using what power I had to alleviate my little friend's\r\nmisery,--that subtile and mysterious agency, which, in our blindness\r\nand need, we term Chance, interposed its offices, rolled away the\r\ncloud from the mystery, and, like a good angel, rescued Clarian, even\r\nas he was tottering upon the very brink of the dismal precipice to\r\nwhose borders he had innocently strayed.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that pleasant June day. It was the first time\r\nthat Clarian had been out since his illness; and I was his single\r\ncompanion, as he strayed slowly along through the college grounds,\r\nleaning tremulously upon my arm, dragging his feet languidly over the\r\npebbled walks, and drinking in the warm, fresh, quivering air with a\r\nmanner that, although apathetic, still spoke of some power of\r\nenjoyment. It was during the hour for the forenoon recitation, and\r\nthe elm-shaded campus was entirely free of students. As Clarian\r\nwalked along, his eyes bent down, I heard him murmuring that\r\ndelicious verse of George Herbert's,--\r\n\r\n  \"Sweet day! so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n    The bridal of the earth and sky!\r\n  The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,\r\n    For thou must die!\"\r\n\r\n\"'For thou must die,'--so sad! And yet the thought itself of death is\r\nnot that which saddens us so, do you think, Ned?\" he went on, I\r\nhearing his words without heeding them,--for I was looking just then\r\ntowards the outer gate next the President's house, through which I\r\nsaw Dr. Thorne coming rapidly, accompanied by a stout, middle-aged\r\nman, having the dress and appearance of a well-to-do farmer,--\"Not\r\nthe thought, simply, 'Thou must die,'\" repeated Clarian, in his\r\nplaintive murmur, \"but the feeling that all this decay and death is\r\nof ourselves, and could be averted by ourselves, had we only\r\nself-control, could we only keep ourselves pure, and so be ever near God\r\nand _of_ Him. _There's_ cause for a deeper melancholy, poignanter\r\ntears than ever Jacques shed.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Thorne and his companion were now quite near, coming towards us\r\non the same path, when I saw the stranger slap his thigh\r\nenergetically and catch Thorne by the arm, while he exclaimed in\r\ntones of boisterous surprise,--\r\n\r\n\"Why, there's the very little chap, as I'm alive!\"\r\n\r\nI had half a glimpse of the Doctor's seizing his companion and\r\nclapping one hand over his mouth, as if to prevent him from saying\r\nmore,--but it was too late. At the sound of the man's voice I felt\r\nClarian bound electrically. He looked up,--over his face began to\r\ncome again that terrible anguish of the night of the picture, but the\r\nmuscles seemed too weak to bring it all back,--he grew limp against\r\nme,--his arms hung inert at his side,--a word that sounded like\r\n\"Spare me!\" gurgled in his throat,--a feeble shudder shook him, and,\r\nere I could interpose my arm, he sank in a heap at my feet, white,\r\nand cold, and lifeless. Before I had raised him, Thorne and the man\r\nsprang to my aid, and the latter, bending over with eager haste, took\r\nthe thin white hands in his own, half caressing them, half fearing to\r\ngrasp them, speaking to him the while in tones of frightened\r\nentreaty, that, on any other occasion, would have been ludicrous\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, my little man,\" said he,--\"come, don't be afeard, _don't_\r\nbe afeard of me! Dan Buckhurst won't harm ye, not for the world, poor\r\nchild! Come, stand up! 'Twas all a joke. Come, come!--My God! Doctor,\r\nhe a'n't dead, is he?\" cried he to Thorne, in horror.\r\n\r\n\"If he is, you have killed him, you damned old fool, you!\" responded\r\nThorne, impetuously, thrusting the man aside with an angry gesture,\r\nand bending down to examine the lad's inert form. \"Thank God, Ned,\"\r\nsaid he at last, \"it is only a swoon this time, and we'll soon have\r\nhim all right. We must get him to bed, though. Here, Buckhurst, you\r\nare the strongest; stop whimpering there, you old jackanapes, and\r\nbring him along.\"\r\n\r\nBuckhurst quickly obeyed, lifting Clarian up in his arms as gently\r\nand tenderly as if he had been an infant, and following Thorne, who\r\nled the way to our rooms. There the lad was placed upon the bed with\r\nwhich he had become only too familiar, and the Doctor, by means of\r\nhis restoratives, soon had the satisfaction of recalling breath and\r\nmotion. As soon as the boy's sighs gave evidence of returning\r\nvitality, Thorne thrust us all from the room, including Mac, who had\r\nnow come in from class, saying to Buckhurst,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Sir, tell them all about it,--and wait here; I shall want you\r\npresently.\" With which words he closed the door upon us, and returned\r\nto his patient.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckhurst refused the chair tendered him by Mac, and paced up and\r\ndown the room in a state of immense perturbation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" said he, \"well, I never! It taken me all aback,\r\nSir,\" added he, turning to me. \"Did you ever see anything like it?\r\nWhy, he's jest like a gal! Dang it, Sir! my Molly a'n't half as\r\nnervous as he is. I hope he'll get well,--I raelly do, now. I\r\nwouldn't hev had it happen for I dunno what, now, indeed!\" And he\r\nresumed his walk, repeating to himself, \"Well, I never! Who'd 'a'\r\njudged 'twas a child like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"May I beg to know what you refer to, Mr. Buckhurst?\" asked Mac, with\r\nconsiderable impatience in his tones.\r\n\r\n\"Eh,--what? He's mighty delicate, a'n't he?\" said the man, with his\r\nthumb indicating the next room.\r\n\r\n\"Very delicate indeed, Sir,--perhaps you can explain the cause of his\r\npresent attack,\" said I, angrily; for I had begun to think, from\r\nBuckhurst's manner, that he had been guilty of some practical joke\r\nupon Clarian. I saw the fire of a similar suspicion blazing in Mac's\r\neyes; and I fear, had our conclusions been verified, the worthy Mr.\r\nBuckhurst would have fared very badly at our hands, spite the laws of\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\n\"What! did he never tell you? Of course not, though, being sick ever\r\nsence, and thinking me dead, too. Well, I'll tell you: but mind, you\r\nmustn't banter the child about it, for he can't stand it,--though\r\nit's only a joke. Might have been serious, to be sure, but, as things\r\nturns out, a pretty good joke, to my notion,--though I'm rael sorry\r\n_he's_ been so bad about it.\"\r\n\r\nMac rose, removed his coat, and marched deliberately up to our guest.\r\n\"See here, Sir,\" said he in his deepest bass voice, which his dark\r\nfrown made still more ominous, \"do you mean us to infer that you have\r\nbeen making that child Clarian the victim of any of your infernal\r\n_jokes_, as you style them?\"\r\n\r\nBuckhurst stared a moment, and then, seeming to comprehend the drift\r\nof Mac's words, burst into a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir!\" he shouted, \"the shoe's on the other foot, thank the Lord!\r\nThe boy himself played the joke, or trick, whatever it was. Dr.\r\nThorne tells me he was kind of crazy, from drinking laudanum, or some\r\nsech pisonous matter. Howsever that was, I'm sure he didn't do it in\r\nairnest,--thought so from the very first,--and now I've had a good\r\nlook at his face, I'd swear to it\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\" asked Mac, hurriedly.\r\n\r\nBuckhurst laughed in that hearty way of his. Said he,--\r\n\r\n\"I'll wager you a stack of hay agin them books yander you couldn't\r\nguess in a week now. What d'ye think it was? Ho! ho! Why, why, the\r\nlittle rascal shoved me into the canawl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoved you into the canal!\" echoed I, while Mac, looking first at\r\nhim, then at me, finally burst into a peal of laughter, shouting the\r\nwhile,--\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! There's your 'experience' philosophy, Ned Blount! Catch me\r\nteaching milksops again! Go on, Buckhurst, tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Buckhurst, apparently quite pleased to see that we\r\nlaughed with him. \"It don't look like it was in the nature of things,\r\nsomehow, does it? Fact, though, he did indeed. Shoved me right in, so\r\nquick I didn't know what the Devil was the matter, until I soused\r\nkersplash! and see him taking out over the drawbridge like mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that, Mr. Buckhurst?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jest inside of a month ago, Sir, one night.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sapperment_, Ned! that was the time of the 'herb Pantagruelion'!--\r\nWell, what were you doing on the canal at that hour?\" asked Mac,\r\nslyly.\r\n\r\n\"No, you needn't, now,--I see you wink at him,--honor bright. I'd\r\nbeen up to town, to take a mess o' clams at Giberson's, with maybe a\r\nsprinklin' of his apple-jack,--nothing else,--and I was on my way\r\nhome,--to Skillman's tavern at the _dépôt_, you know,--and I'd jest\r\nstopped a piece, and was a-standing there, looking at the moon in the\r\nwater, when he tipped me over. I tell you, I was mad when I crawled\r\nout wet as a rat; and if I'd ketched him then, you may depend upon\r\nit, I'd 'a' given his jacket a precious warming. As I said, he run\r\noff, but jest as I turned towards the tavern, I see him a-coming\r\nback, kinder wild-like; so I slipped behind a lumber-pile, hoping he\r\nmight come over the bridge, so I could lay my fingers on him. The\r\nmoon was about its highest, so I could see his face, plain as day,--\r\nwhite,--skim-milk warn't a circumstance to it,--and his eyes wide\r\nopen as they could stretch. I tell you, he was wild! He looked up and\r\ndown a bit, mumbled somethin' I couldn't make out, and then what do\r\nyou think that boy did? Why, he jumped in, clothes and all, bold as a\r\nlion,--plainly to save me from drowning, and me all the time a-spyin'\r\nat him from behind a lumber-pile! He was sarching for me, I knowed,\r\nfor he swum up and down jest about there for the space maybe of a\r\nquarter of an hour. And when he give it up at last, and come out, he\r\nkinder sunk down on the tow-path, and I heard him say plain enough,\r\nthough he only whispered it,--jest like a woman actor I see down to\r\nYork oncet, playin' in Guy something or other,--she was a sort of an\r\nold gypsy devil,--says he, 'I am a murderer, then!' Thinks I, 'Sonny,\r\nall but the murderer!' And as he stood up again, he 'peared to suffer\r\nso, his face was so white, and his knees so shaky, that I says to\r\nmyself, 'Dan, you've carried the joke far enough.' So I sings out to\r\nhim, and comes out from behind the lumber-stack, but, Lord bless ye!\r\nhe jest peeped round over his shoulder oncet, gave a kind of chokin'\r\nscream like, and put out up the road as if the Devil was after him. I\r\nknowed it warn't no use to follow him, so I got on a dry shirt and\r\nwent to bed. The next day I went home, and I'd mighty near forgot all\r\nabout it, only today I came to see Dr. Thorne for somethin' to do my\r\ncold good, and he wantin' to know how I ketched it brought the whole\r\nmatter back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're an old brick, Buckhurst!\" cried Mac, giving the jovial farmer\r\na thundering slap on the back, and a hearty grasp of his hand; \"and\r\nyou shall drink the boy's health with Ned and me this day, or I'll\r\nknow the reason why. Ned Blount, a'n't it glorious? Said I not, you\r\nill-omened bird, said I not, _'Il y a toujours un Dieu pour les\r\nenfans et pour les ivrognes'_?--So you came down with Thorne to ease\r\nthe poor little fellow's mind, did you, Buckhurst? That's right, and\r\nyou shall see the picture, by Jove! And you'll say, when you see it,\r\nthat such a picture were cheap at the cost of duckings for a dozen\r\nBuckhursts. Now tell me truly, what do you think made him push you\r\nin?\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it was the pison, Sir,--a baby like that wouldn't harm a\r\nflea. I thought maybe, until I see Dr. Thorne, that he done it out of\r\nmischieviousness, as boys will do, you know,--jest as they steal a\r\nfeller's apples, and knock his turkeys of'n the roost,--but yander's\r\nnot one of them kind; so he must 'a' been crazy, and I'm rael sorry\r\nhe's been so bad put to about it,--I am, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHere the inner door was opened, and Thorne joined us, with a moisture\r\nabout his eyes that he used afterwards to deny most vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"Buckhurst, he wants to see you; go in there,\" said he,--adding, in a\r\nlower tone, \"Now, mind you, the child's delicate as spun glass; so be\r\ncareful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Mr. Buckhurst,\" called Clarian.\r\n\r\nThe worthy farmer looked to right and left, as if he would much\r\nrather have made his escape, but, impelled by a shove from the\r\nDoctor, he ran his fingers through his coarse hair, and, with a very\r\nred and \"I-wish-I-was-out-of-this\" face, went in, closing the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\"Phew!\" said Thorne, seating himself somewhat testily, after having\r\nfilled and lighted a pipe,--\"Phew! So that's over, and I a'n't sorry;\r\nit's as bad as reading the 'Diary of a Physician.' The boy will be\r\nall right now, and the lesson won't hurt him, though it has been a\r\nrough one. But no more metaphysics for him, Ned Blount! And, boys,\r\nlet this be a warning to you. He's too brittle a toy to be handled in\r\nyour rough fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't tell us that, Thorne,\" said Mac, drawing a long breath.\r\n\"Catch me kicking over children's baby-houses again, or telling 'em\r\nghost-stories in the dark!\"\r\n\r\n\"He vows never again to touch brush, crayon, or pencil; and if he is\r\nthe devotee you describe him to be, Ned, I would not advise you to\r\noppose him in his determination. You must keep him here till\r\nvacation, and next term he can exchange his room. Macbeth's company\r\nwill never be very agreeable to him, I should judge; and it will not\r\ndo to let him destroy the picture.\"\r\n\r\nThorne puffed away vigorously for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\"That boy ought to turn preacher, Mac. He touched me nearer just now\r\nthan I have been touched for an age.\r\n\r\n  \"'His voice was a sweet tremble in mine ear,\r\n  Made tunable with every saddest grief,\r\n  Till those sad eyes, so spiritual and clear,'\r\n\r\nalmost persuaded me to follow the example of divine Achilles and\r\n'refresh my soul with tears.' He has that tear-bringing privilege of\r\ngenius, to a certainty.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it seemed, indeed; for presently the worthy Mr. Buckhurst made\r\nhis reappearance in quite a sad state, mopping his red face and\r\nswollen eyes most vigorously with a figured cotton handkerchief, and\r\nproclaiming, with as much intelligibility as the cold in his head and\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of the case would admit of, that he'd \"be\r\ndagg'd ef he hadd't raver be chucked idto _two_ cadawls dad 'ave dat\r\niddocedt baby beggid his pardod about de codfouded duckid! Wat de\r\nhell did _he_ care about gittid wet, he'd like to kdow?\r\nDodsedse!--'twad all dud id fud, adyhow!\"\r\n\r\n----\"And now _you_, my dear, dear friends,\" said Clarian, turning his\r\nsad, full eyes upon us, and calling us to his side, and to his arms.\r\n\r\nBut I shall draw a veil over that interview.\r\n\r\nThat night, after we had talked long and lovingly together, and were\r\nnow sitting, each absorbed in his own thoughts, and emulating the\r\nquiet that reigned around college, Clarian softly joined us, and\r\nplaced an open book in Mac's hands.\r\n\r\n\"Will you, dear Mac?\" murmured he.\r\n\r\nThen Mac, all full of solemn emotion, read through the grand periods\r\nof the Church Litany, and when he had finished, Clarian, with a\r\nthrilling \"Let us pray,\" offered up such a thanksgiving as I had\r\nnever heard, praying to the kind Father who had so mercifully\r\nextricated him, that our paths might still be enlightened, and our\r\nwalks made humble and righteous.\r\n\r\n\"Clarian,\" said Mac, after a pause, when we were again on our feet,--\r\nhe laid his hands on the boy's shoulders, as he spoke, and looked\r\ninto his eyes,--\"Clarian, would it have happened, if you had not\r\ntaken that foul drug?\"\r\n\r\nClarian shuddered, and covered up his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Do not ask me, dear Mac! do not ask me! Oh, be sure, my aims, I\r\nthought, were noble, and myself I thought so pure!--but--I cannot\r\nsay, Mac, I cannot say.\r\n\r\n\"'We are so weak, we know our motives least In their confused\r\nbeginning.'\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, Clarian,\" said Mac, after a while, his deep voice\r\nwonderfully refined with strong emotion, \"at least, the picture was\r\nnot painted in vain. Even as it is in the play, Banquo died that his\r\nissue might reign after him; and this lesson of ours will bear fruit\r\nfar mightier than the trifling pains of its parturition. Ay, Clarian,\r\nyour picture has not been vainly painted.--And now, Ned,\" said he,\r\nrising, \"we must put our baby to bed; for he is to wake early\r\nto-morrow, and know himself a man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Doves on the sunny eaves are cooing,\r\n  The chip-bird trills from the apple-tree,\r\n  Blossoms are bursting and leaves renewing,\r\n  And the crocus darts up the spring to see.\r\n\r\n  Spring has come with a smile of blessing,\r\n  Kissing the earth with her soft warm breath,\r\n  Till it blushes in flowers at her gentle caressing,\r\n  And wakes from the winter's dream of death.\r\n\r\n  Spring has come! The rills, as they glisten,\r\n  Sing to the pebbles and greening grass;\r\n  Under the sward the violets listen,\r\n  And dream of the sky as they hear her pass.\r\n\r\n  Coyest of roses feel her coming,\r\n  Swelling their buds with a promise to her,--\r\n  And the wild bee hears her, around them humming,\r\n  And booms about with a joyous stir.\r\n\r\n  Oaks, that the bark of a century covers,\r\n  Feel ye the spell, as ye groan and sigh?\r\n  Say,--does her spirit that round you hovers\r\n  Whisper of youth and love gone by?\r\n\r\n  Windows are open,--the pensive maiden\r\n  Leans o'er the sill with a wistful sigh,\r\n  Her heart with tender longings o'erladen,\r\n  And a happy sadness, she knows not why.\r\n\r\n  For we and the trees are brothers in nature;--\r\n  We feel in our veins the season's thrill\r\n  In hopes that reach to a higher stature,\r\n  In blind dim longings beyond our will.\r\n\r\n  Whence dost thou come, O joyous spirit?\r\n  From realms beyond this human ken,\r\n  To paint with beauty the earth we inherit,\r\n  And soften to love the hearts of men?\r\n\r\n  Dear angel! that blowest with breath of gladness\r\n  The trump to waken the year in its grave,\r\n  Shall we not hear, after death's deep sadness,\r\n  A voice as tender to gladden and save?\r\n\r\n  Dost thou not sing a constant promise\r\n  That joy shall follow that other voice,--\r\n  That nothing of good shall be taken from us,\r\n  But all who hear it shall rise, to rejoice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUFUS CHOATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Choate's mind was so complex, peculiar, and original,--so foreign\r\nin temperament and spirit to the more representative traits of New\r\nEngland character,--so large, philosophic, and sagacious in vision\r\nand survey of great questions, and so dramatic and vehement in their\r\nexposition and enforcement,--so judicial and conservative in always\r\nmaintaining in his arguments the balance and relation of\r\ninterdependent principles, and so often in details marring the most\r\nexquisite poetry with the wildest extravagancies of style,--so free\r\nfrom mere vulgar tricks of effect, and so full of imaginative\r\ntricksiness and surprises,--so mischievous, subtle, mysterious,\r\nelusive, Protean,--that it is no wonder he has been more admired and\r\nmore misunderstood than any eminent American of his time. It was\r\nbecause of these unaccustomed qualities of mind that matter-of-fact\r\nlawyers and judges came slowly but surely to Mr. Webster's\r\nconclusion, that he was \"the most accomplished of American lawyers,\"\r\nwhether arguing to courts or juries. In the same way, critically\r\ncorrect but unimaginative scholars, who \"can pardon anything but a\r\nfalse quantity,\"--who \"see the hair on the rope, but not the rope,\"\r\nand detect minute errors, but not poetic apprehension,--admitted at\r\nlast the fulness and variety of his scholastic attainments. And\r\nperhaps the finest tribute to the power and subtlety of his influence\r\nwas, that, to the last, juries, who began cases by steeling\r\nthemselves against it, and who ended by giving him their verdicts,\r\nmaintained that they were not at all influenced by him,--so profound,\r\nso complete, and so unconscious had been the spell this man of genius\r\nhad woven around them.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that a great lawyer in the United States is\r\ncalled upon (as he is not in England) to practise in all our courts,\r\ncivil and criminal, law, equity, and admiralty, and, in addition to\r\nall the complicated questions between parties, involving life,\r\nliberty, and property, arising therein, that he is to know and\r\ndiscuss our whole scheme of government, from questions under its\r\npatent laws up to questions of jurisdiction and constitutional\r\nlaw,--it will be seen what a field there is for the exhibition of the\r\nhighest talents, and how few lawyers in the country can become\r\neminent in all these various and important departments of mental\r\nlabor. In their whole extent Mr. Choate was not only thoroughly\r\ninformed as a student and profound as a reasoner, but his genius\r\nproduced such a fusion of imagination and understanding as to give\r\ncreativeness to argumentation and philosophy to treatment of facts.\r\n\r\nWe propose to try to give some idea of those mental characteristics\r\nand peculiarities in which he differed from other lawyers, and to\r\nindicate some salient points of his genius and nature which went to\r\nmake up so original and interesting an individuality. Immense labor\r\nand talent will no more produce genius or its results, than mere\r\nnatural genius, without their aid and instrumentality, can reach and\r\nmaintain the highest rank in any of the great departments of life or\r\nthought. With true genius, imagination is, to be sure, paramount to\r\ngreat and balanced faculties; but genius is always demonstrating its\r\nsuperiority to talent as well by its greater rapidity and certainty\r\nin seizing, arranging, and holding facts, and by the extent of its\r\nacquisitions, as by its superior philosophic and artistic grasp and\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Choate was so much more than a mere lawyer, it was in\r\ncourt that he displayed the full force and variety of his powers.\r\n_Hic currus et arma_. We shall, however, speak more especially of his\r\njury-trials, because in them more of his whole nature was brought\r\ninto play, and because of them and of his management of them there is\r\nand can be no full record. The arguments and triumphs of the great\r\nadvocate are almost as evanescent and traditionary as the\r\nconversation of great talkers like Coleridge. In what we have to say\r\nwe cannot be expected to call up the arguments and cases themselves,\r\nand we must necessarily be confined to a somewhat general statement\r\nof certain mental qualities and characteristics which were of the\r\nsecret of his power. We shall be rewarded, if we succeed in giving in\r\nmere outline some explanation of the fact, that so much of interest\r\nand something of mystery attach themselves throughout the country to\r\nhis name and genius.\r\n\r\nA jury-trial is in itself dramatic; but mere eloquence is but a small\r\npart of what is demanded of a great advocate. Luther Martin and\r\nJeremiah Mason were the most eminent American examples of the very\r\nmany great jury-lawyers who were almost destitute of all that makes\r\nup popular eloquence. A jury-lawyer is of course greater with it, but\r\nhe can do entirely without it. Almost all great trials appeal to the\r\nintellects rather than to the passions of jurors. What an advocate\r\nneeds first is thorough knowledge of law, and that adaptiveness and\r\nreadiness of faculty which are never surprised into forgetfulness or\r\nconfusion, so that he can instantly see, meet, reason upon, and apply\r\nhis legal learning to the unexpected as well as the expected points\r\nof law and evidence as they arise in a case. Secondly, he must have\r\nthorough knowledge of human nature: he must not only profoundly\r\ndiscuss motives in their relations to the laws of the human mind, and\r\npractically reconcile motives with conduct as they relate to the\r\nparties and witnesses in his cases, but he must prepare, present,\r\ndevelop, guide, and finally argue his case, within the rules of law,\r\nwith strict reference to its effect upon the differing minds of\r\ntwelve men. It would be difficult to name any other field of public\r\nmental effort which demands and gives scope for such variety of\r\nfaculty and accomplishment.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Mr. Choate's defects of character or of style,\r\nno competent judge ever saw his management of any case in court, from\r\nits opening to its close, without recognizing that he was a man of\r\ngenius. It mattered not whether the amount involved was little or\r\ngreat, whether the parties were rich or poor, wise or ignorant,\r\nwhether the subject-matter was dry or fertile,--such were his\r\nimaginative insight, his knowledge of law and of human nature, his\r\nperfection of arrangement, under which every point was treated fully,\r\nbut none unduly, his consummate tact and tactics, his command of\r\nlanguage in all its richness and delicacy to express the fullest\r\nforce and the nicest shades of his meaning, and his haggard beauty of\r\nperson and grace of nature, that every case rose to dramatic dignity\r\nand to its largest relations to law, psychology, and poetry; and\r\nthus, while giving it artistic unity and completeness, he all the\r\nmore enforced his arguments and insured his success. How widely\r\ndifferent in method and surroundings from the poet's exercise of the\r\ncreative faculty in the calm of thought and retirement, on a selected\r\ntopic and in selected hours of inspiration, was his entering, with\r\nlittle notice or preparation, into a case involving complicated\r\nquestions of law and fact, with only a partial knowledge of the case\r\nof his antagonist! met at point after point by unexpected evidence\r\nand rulings of law, often involving such instantaneous decisions as\r\nto change his whole combinations and method of attack; examining\r\nwitnesses with unerring skill, whom he was at once too chivalrous and\r\ntoo wise to browbeat; arguing to the court unexpected questions of\r\nlaw with full and available legal learning; carrying in his mind the\r\ncase, and the known or surmised plan of attack of his antagonist, and\r\nshaping his own case to meet it; holding an exquisitely sensitive\r\nphysical and mental organization in such perfect control as never to\r\nbe irritated or disturbed; throwing his whole force on a given point,\r\nand rising to a joyousness of power in meeting the great obstacles to\r\nhis success; and finally, with little or no respite for preparation,\r\nweaving visibly, as it were, before the mental eye, from all these\r\nelicited materials, his closing argument, which, as we have said, was\r\nall the more effective, because profound reasoning and exquisite tact\r\nand influence were involved in it as a work of art.\r\n\r\nHe had the temperament of the great actors,--that of the elder Kean\r\nand the elder Booth, not of Kemble and Macready,--and, like them, had\r\nthe power of almost instantly passing into the nature and thought and\r\nemotion of another, and of not only absolutely realizing them, but of\r\nrealizing them all the more completely because he had at the same\r\ntime perfect self-direction and self-control. The absurd question is\r\noften asked, whether an actor is ever the character he represents\r\nthroughout a whole play. He could be so, only if insane. But every\r\ngreat actor and orator must be capable of instantaneous abandonment\r\nto his part, and of as instantaneous withdrawal from it,--like the\r\nelder Booth, joking one minute at a side-scene and in the next having\r\nthe big tears of a realized Lear running down his cheeks. An eminent\r\ncritic says,--\"Genius always lights its own fire,\"--and this constant\r\ndouble process of mind,--one of self-direction and self-control, the\r\nother of absolute abandonment and identification,--each the more\r\ncomplete for the other,--the dramatic poet, the impassioned orator,\r\nand the great interpretative actor, all know, whenever the whole mind\r\nand nature are in their highest action. Mr. Choate, therefore, from\r\npure force of mental constitution, threw himself into the life and\r\nposition of the parties and witnesses in a jury-case, and they\r\nnecessarily became _dramatis personae_, and moved in an atmosphere of\r\nhis own creation. His narrative was the simplest and most artistic\r\nexhibition of his case thus seen and presented from the point of\r\ntheir lives and natures, and not from the dry facts and points of his\r\ncase; and his argument was all the more perfect, because not\r\nexhibited in skeleton nakedness, but incorporated and intertwined\r\nwith the interior and essential life of persons and events. It was in\r\nthis way that he effected the acquittal of Tirrell, whom any\r\nmatter-of-fact lawyer, however able, would have argued straight to the\r\ngallows; and yet we have the highest judicial authority for saying\r\nthat in that case he did his simple technical duty, without\r\ninterposing his own opinions or convictions. We shall say a word,\r\nbefore we close, of the charge that he surrendered himself too\r\ncompletely to his client; but to a great degree the explanation and\r\nthe excuse at once lie in this dramatic imagination, which was of the\r\nessence of his genius and influence, and through which he lived the\r\nlife, shared the views, and identified himself with a great actor's\r\nrealization, in _the part_ of his client.\r\n\r\nIn making real to himself the nature, life, and position of his\r\nclient,--in gathering from him and his witnesses, in the preparation\r\nand trial of his case, its main facts and direction, as colored or\r\ninflamed by his client's opinions, passions, and motives,--and in\r\nseeking their explanation in the egotism and idiosyncrasy which his\r\nown sympathetic insight penetrated and harmonized into a consistent\r\nindividuality,--he, of course, knew his client better than his client\r\nknew himself; he conceived him as an actor conceives character, and,\r\nin a great measure, saw with his eyes from his point of view, and, in\r\nthe argument of his case, gave clear expression and consistent\r\ncharacterization to his nature and to his partisan views in their\r\nrelations to the history of the case. We have seen his clients sit\r\nlistening to the story of their own lives and conduct, held off in\r\nartistic relief and in dramatic relation, with tears running down\r\ncheeks which had not been moistened by the actual events themselves,\r\nre-presented by his arguments in such coloring and perspective.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this power of merging his own individuality in that of\r\nhis client was his absolute freedom from egotism, conceit,\r\nself-assertion, and personal pride of opinion. Such an instance is, of\r\ncourse, exceptional. Nearly all the eminent jury-lawyers we have\r\nknown have been, consciously or unconsciously, self-asserting, and\r\ntheir individuality rather than that of their clients has been\r\nimpressed upon juries. An advocate with a great jury-reputation has\r\ntwo victories to win: the first, to overcome the determination of the\r\njury to steel themselves against his influence; the second, to\r\nconvince their judgments. Mr. Choate's self-surrender was so complete\r\nthat they soon forgot him, because he forgot himself in his case;\r\nnothing personally demonstrative or antagonistic induced obstinacy or\r\nopposition, and every door was soon wide open to sympathy and\r\nconviction. If an advocate is conceited, or vain, or self-important,\r\nor if he thinks of producing effects as well for himself as for his\r\nclient, or if his nature is hard and unadaptive,--great abilities\r\ndisplay these qualities, instead of hiding them, and they make a\r\nrefracting medium between a case and the minds of a jury. Mr. Choate\r\nwas more completely free from them than any able man we ever knew.\r\nAny one of them would have been in complete contradiction to the\r\nwhole composition and current of his nature. Though conscious of his\r\npowers, he was thoroughly and lovingly modest. It was because he\r\nthought so little of himself and so much of his client that he never\r\nmade personal issues, and was never diverted by them from his strict\r\nand full duty. Instead of \"greatly finding quarrel in a straw,\" where\r\nsome supposed honor was at stake, he would suffer himself rather than\r\nthat his case should suffer. Early in his practice, when a friend\r\ntold him he bore too much from opposing counsel without rebuking\r\nthem, he said: \"Do you suppose I care what those men say? I want to\r\nget my client's case.\" Want of pugnacity too often passes for want of\r\ncourage. We have seen him in positions where we wished he could have\r\nbeen more personally demonstrative, and (to apply the language of the\r\nring to the contests of the court-room) that he could have stood\r\nstill and struck straight from the shoulder; but when we remember how\r\nperfectly he saw through and through the faults and foibles of men,\r\nhow his mischievous and genial irony, when it touched personal\r\ncharacter, stamped and characterized it for life, and how keen was\r\nthe edge and how fine the play of every weapon in his full armory of\r\nsarcasm and ridicule, (of which his speech in the Senate in reply to\r\nMr. McDuffie's personalities gives masterly exhibition,) we are\r\nthankful that his sensibility was so exquisite and his temper so\r\nsweet, that he was a delight instead of a terror, and that he was\r\nloved instead of feared. Delicacy should be commensurate to power,\r\nthat each may be complete. It would seem almost impossible that a\r\nlawyer with a practice truly immense, passing a great part of his\r\nlife in public and heated contests and in discussing and often\r\nseverely criticizing the motives and conduct of parties and\r\nwitnesses, should not make many enemies; but he was so essentially\r\nmodest, simple, gentlemanly, and tender, so considerate of the\r\nfeelings of others, so evidently trying to mitigate the pain which it\r\nwas often his duty to inflict, that we never heard of his searching\r\nand subtile examination of witnesses, or his profound and exhaustive\r\nanalysis of character and motive, or his instantaneous and\r\nirresistible retorts upon counsel, creating or leaving behind him, in\r\nthe bar or out of it, malice or ill-will in a human being. One of the\r\nmost touching and beautiful things we ever saw in a court-room would\r\nhave been in other hands purely painful and repulsive. It was his\r\nexamination of the wretched women who were witnesses in the Tirrell\r\ncase. His tact in eliciting what was necessary to be known, and which\r\nthey would have concealed, was forgotten and lost in his chivalrous\r\nand Christian recognition of their common humanity, and in his\r\ngentlemanly thoughtfulness that even they were still women, with\r\nfeelings yet sensitive to eye and word.\r\n\r\nIn jury-trials it would be foolish to judge style by severe or\r\nclassic standards. If an advocate have skill and insight and adequate\r\npowers of expression, his style must yield and vary with the\r\ncircumstances of different cases and the minds of different juries\r\nand jurors. When a friend of Erskine asked him, at the close of a\r\njury-argument, why he so unusually and iteratively, and with such\r\nsingular illustration, prolonged one part of his case, he said,--\"It\r\ntook me two hours to make that fat man with the buff waistcoat join\r\nthe eleven!\"\r\n\r\nAll men of great powers of practical influence over the minds of men\r\nknow how stupid and dull of apprehension the mass of mankind are; and\r\nno one knows better than a great jury-lawyer in how many different\r\nways it is often necessary to present arguments, and how they must be\r\npressed, urged, and _hammered_ into most men's minds. He is\r\nendeavoring to persuade and convince twelve men upon a question in\r\nwhich they have no direct pecuniary or personal interest, and he must\r\nmore or less know and adapt his reasoning and his style to each\r\njuror's mind. He should know no audience but the judge and these\r\ntwelve men. Retainers never seek and should not find counsel who\r\naddress jurors with classical or formal correctness. Napoleon, at St.\r\nHelena, after reading one of his bulletins, which had produced the\r\ngreat and exact effect for which he had intended it, exclaimed,--\"And\r\nyet they said I couldn't write!\"\r\n\r\nThe true Yankee is suspicious of eloquence, and \"stops a metaphor\r\nlike a suspected person in an enemy's country.\" A stranger, who\r\nlooked in for a few minutes upon one of Mr. Choate's jury-arguments,\r\nand saw a lawyer with a lithe and elastic figure of about five feet\r\nand eleven inches, with a face not merely of a scholarly paleness,\r\nbut wrinkled all over, and, as it were, scathed with thought and with\r\npast nervous and intellectual struggles, yet still beautiful, with\r\nblack hair curling as if from heat and dewy from heightened action\r\nand intensity of thought and feeling, and heard a clear, sympathetic,\r\nand varying voice uttering rapidly and unhesitatingly, sometimes with\r\nsweet caesural and almost monotonous cadences, and again with\r\nstartling and electric shocks, language now exquisitely delicate and\r\npoetic, now vehement in its direct force, and again decorated and\r\nwild with Eastern extravagance and fervor of fancy, would have\r\nthought him the last man to have been born on New England soil, or to\r\nconvince the judgments of twelve Yankee jurors. But those twelve men,\r\nif he had opened the case himself, had been quietly, simply, and\r\nsympathetically led into a knowledge of its facts in connection with\r\nits actors and their motives; they had seen how calmly and with what\r\ntact he had examined his witnesses, how ready, graceful, and unheated\r\nhad been his arguments to the court, and how complete throughout had\r\nbeen his self-possession and self-control; they had, moreover,\r\nlearned and become interested in the case, and were no longer the\r\nsame hard and dispassionate men with whom he had begun, and they\r\nknew, as the casual spectator could not know, how systematically he\r\nwas arguing while he was also vehemently enforcing his case. _He_,\r\nmeanwhile, knew his twelve men, and what arguments, appeals, and\r\nillustrations were needed to reach the minds of one or all. He did\r\nnot care how certain extravagances of style struck the critical\r\nspectator, if they stamped and riveted certain points of his case in\r\nthe minds of his jury. With the keenest perception of the ridiculous\r\nhimself, he did not hesitate to say things which, disconnected from\r\nhis purpose, might seem ridiculous. One consequence of these\r\naudacities of expression was, that, when it became necessary for him\r\nto be iterative, he was never tedious. They gave full play to his\r\nimaginative humor and irony, and to his poetic unexpectedness and\r\nsurprises. A wise observer, hearing him try a case from first to\r\nlast, while recognizing those higher qualities of genius which we\r\nhave before described, saw, that, for all the purposes of persuasion\r\nand argumentation, for conveying his meaning in its full force and in\r\nits most delicate distinctions and shadings, for analytic reasoning\r\nor for the \"clothing upon\" of the imagination, for all the essential\r\nobjects and vital uses of language, his style was perfect for his\r\npurpose and for his audience. His excesses came from surplus power\r\nand dramatic intensity, and were pardoned by all imaginative minds to\r\nthe real genius with which they were informed.\r\n\r\nEvery great advocate must, at times, especially in the trial of\r\ncapital cases, be held popularly responsible for the acquittal of men\r\nwhom the public has prejudged to be guilty. This unreasoning,\r\nimpulsive, and irresponsible public never stops to inform itself;\r\nnever discriminates between legal acumen and pettifogging trickery,\r\nbetween doing one's full duty to his client and interposing or\r\nmisrepresenting his own personal opinions; and never remembers that\r\nthe functions of law and the practice of law are to prevent and to\r\npunish crime, to ascertain the truth, and to determine and enforce\r\njustice,--that trial by jury, and the other means and methods through\r\nwhich justice is administered, are founded in the largest wisdom,\r\nphilanthropy, and experience,--that they cannot work perfectly,\r\nbecause human nature is imperfect, but they constitute the best\r\npractical system for the application of abstract principles of right\r\nto the complicated affairs of life which the world has yet seen, and\r\nwhich steadily improves as our race improves,--and that every great\r\nlawyer is aiding in elucidating truth and in administering justice,\r\nwhen doing his duty to his client under this system. Our trial by\r\njury has its imperfections; but, laying aside its demonstrated value\r\nand necessity in great struggles for freedom, before and since the\r\ntime of Erskine, no better scheme can be devised to do its great and\r\nindispensable work. The very things which seem to an uninformed man\r\nlike rejection or confusion of truth are a part of the sifting by\r\nwhich it is to be reached. The admission or rejection of evidence\r\nunder sound rules of law, the presenting of the whole case of each\r\nparty and of the best argument which can be made upon it by his\r\ncounsel, the charge of the judge and the verdict of the jury,--all\r\nare necessary parts of the process of reaching truth and justice.\r\nCounsel themselves cannot know a whole case until tried to its end;\r\ntheir clients have a right to their best services, within the limits\r\nof personal honor; and lawyers are derelict in duty, not only to\r\ntheir clients, but to justice itself, if they do not present their\r\ncases to the best of their ability, when they are to be followed by\r\nopposing counsel, by the judge, and by the jury. The popular judgment\r\nis not only capricious,--it not only assumes that legal precedents,\r\nfounded in justice for the protection of the honest, are petty\r\ntechnicalities or tricks through which the dishonest escape,--it is\r\nnot only formed out of the court-room, with no opportunity to see\r\nwitnesses and hear testimony, often very different in reality from\r\nwhat they seem in print,--but it visits upon counsel its ignorant\r\nprejudices against the theory and practice of the law itself, and\r\nforgets that lawyers cannot present to the jury a particle of\r\nevidence except with the sanction of the court under sound rules of\r\nlaw, and that the law is to be laid down by the court alone.\r\n\r\nA man thoroughly in earnest in any direction is more or less a\r\npartisan. Histories are commonly uninfluential or worthless, unless\r\nwritten with views so earnest and decided as to show bias. As the\r\ngreater interests of truth are best subserved by those whose zeal is\r\ncommensurate to their scope of mind, so it is a part of the scheme of\r\njury-trials, that, within the limits we have named, counsel shall\r\nthrow their whole force into their cases, that thus they may be\r\npresented fully in all lights, and the right results more surely\r\nreached. The scheme of jury-trials itself thus providing for a\r\nlawyer's standing in the place of his client and deriving from him\r\nhis partisan opinions, and for urging his case in its full force\r\nwithin the limits of sound rules of law, it almost invariably\r\nfollows, that, the greater the talent and zeal of the advocate, and\r\nthe more he believes in the views of his client, the more liable he\r\nis to be charged with overstating or misstating testimony. Mr. Choate\r\nnever conceived that his duty to his client should carry him up to\r\nthe line of self-surrender drawn by Lord Brougham; but, recognizing\r\nhis client's full and just claims upon him, entering into his\r\nopinions and nature with the sympathetic and dramatic realization we\r\nhave described, he could not faithfully perform the prescribed and\r\nadmitted duty of the advocate,--necessarily, with him, involving his\r\nthrowing the whole force of his physical and intellectual vitality\r\ninto every case he tried,--without being a vehement partisan, or\r\nwithout being sometimes charged with misstating evidence or going too\r\nfar for his client. Occasionally this may have been true; but we see\r\nthe explanation in the very quality of his genius and temperament,\r\nand not in conscious or intentional wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nHis ability and method in his strictly legal arguments to courts of\r\nlaw are substantially indicated in what we have already said. His\r\nmanner, however, was here calm, his general views of his subject\r\nlarge and philosophic, his legal learning full, his reasoning clear,\r\nstrong, and consequential, his discrimination quick and sure, and his\r\ndetection of a logical fallacy unerring, his style, though sometimes\r\nfairly open to the charge of redundancy, graceful and transparent in\r\nits exhibition of his argument, and his mind always at home, and in\r\nits easiest and most natural exercise, when anything in his case rose\r\ninto connection with great principles.\r\n\r\nWhile exhibiting in his jury-trials, as we have shown, this double\r\nprocess of absolute identification and of perfect supervision and\r\nself-control,--of instantaneous imaginative dips into his work, and\r\nof as instantaneous withdrawal from it,--of purposely and yet\r\ncompletely throwing himself in one sentence into the realization of\r\nan emotion, thus perfectly conveying his meaning while living the\r\nthought, and yet coming out of it to see quicker than any one that it\r\nmight be made absurd by displacement,--he always had, as it were, an\r\nair-drawn, circle of larger thought and superintending relation far\r\naround the immediate question into which he passed so dramatically.\r\nWithin this outer circle, attached and related to it by everything in\r\nthe subject-matter of real poetic or philosophic importance, was his\r\ncase, creatively woven and spread in artistic light and perspective;\r\nand between the two (if we do not press our illustration beyond clear\r\nlimits) was a heat-lightning-like play of mind, showing itself, at\r\none moment, in unexpected flashes of poetic analogy, at another in\r\nPuck-like mischief, and again in imaginative irony or humor.\r\n\r\nAs he recovered himself from abandonment to some part of his case or\r\nargument to guide and mould the whole, so, going into his library, he\r\ncould, as completely, for minutes or for hours, banish and forget his\r\nanxieties and dramatic excitements, and pass into the cooling air and\r\nloftier and purer stimulations of the great minds of other times and\r\ncountries and of the great questions that overhang us all. His mind,\r\ncapacious, informed, wise, doubting, \"looking before and after,\" here\r\nfound its highest pleasures, and its little, but most loved repose.\r\n\"The more a man does, the more he can do\"; and, notwithstanding his\r\nimmense practice, and that by physical and intellectual constitution\r\nhe couldn't _half_ do anything, he never allowed a day of his life to\r\npass, without reading some, if ever so little, Greek, and it was a\r\nsurprise to those who knew him well to find that he kept up with\r\neverything important in modern literature. Rising and going to bed\r\nearly, taking early morning exercise, having a strong constitution,\r\nthough he was subject to sudden but quickly overcome nervous and\r\nbilious illness, wasting no time, caring nothing for the coarser\r\nsocial enjoyments, leading, out of court, a self-withdrawn and\r\nsolitary life, though playful, genial, and stimulating in social\r\nintercourse, with a memory as tenacious and ready as his apprehension\r\nwas quick, with high powers of detecting, mastering, arranging, and\r\nfusing his acquisitions, and of penetrating to the centre of\r\nhistorical characters and events,--it is not strange, though he may\r\nnot have been critically exact and nice in questions of quantity and\r\ncollege exercises, that his scholarship was large and available in\r\nall its higher aims and uses.\r\n\r\nIt will naturally be asked, how such qualities as we have described\r\nmanifested themselves in character, and in political and other fields\r\nof thought and exertion. Fair abilities, zeal, industry, a sanguine\r\ntemperament, and some special bent or fitness for the profession of\r\nthe law, will make a good and successful lawyer. Such a man's mind\r\nwill be entirely in and limited by the immediate case in hand, and\r\nvirtually his intellectual life will be recorded in his cases. But\r\nwith Mr. Choate, the dramatic genius and large scope and vision which\r\nmade him superior to other great advocates at the same time prevented\r\nhis overestimating the value of his work in kind or degree, showed\r\nhim how ephemeral are the actual triumphs and how small the real\r\nvalue of nearly all the questions he thus vitalized into artistic\r\nreality, when compared with the great outlying truths and principles\r\nto which he allied them. Feeling this all through his cases, at the\r\nsame time that he was moulding them and giving them dramatic\r\nvitality, they took their true position from natural reaction and\r\nrebound, with all the more sharpness of contrast, when he came out of\r\nthem. With such a nature, it could be assumed _a priori_ as a\r\npsychological certainty, at any rate it was the fact with him, that a\r\ncertain unreality was at times thrown over life and its objects, that\r\nits projects and ambitions seemed games and mockeries, and \"this\r\nbrave o'erhanging firmament a pestilent congregation of vapors,\" and\r\nthat grave doubts and fears on the great questions of existence were\r\never on the horizon of his mind. This gave perpetual play to his\r\nirony, and made it a necessity and a relief of mind. Except when in\r\nearnest in some larger matter, or closely occupied in accomplishing\r\nsome smaller necessary purpose or duty, his imagination loved the\r\ntricksy play of exhibiting the petty side of life in contrast to its\r\nrealities, just as in his cases it found its exercise in lifting them\r\nup to relations with what is poetic and permanent. But, though irony\r\nwas thus the natural language of his mind, it did not pass beyond the\r\nlimits of the mischievous and kindly, because there was nothing\r\nscoffing or bitter in his nature. It was fresh and natural, never\r\nstudied for effect, and gave his conversation the charm of constant\r\nnovelty and surprises. He loved to condense the results of thought\r\nand study into humorous or grotesque overstatements, which, while\r\nthey amused his hearers, conveyed his exact meaning to every one who\r\nfollowed the mercurial movement of his mind. It will readily be seen\r\nhow a person with neither insight into his nature nor apprehension of\r\nhis meaning should, without intending it, misinterpret his life and\r\ncaricature his opinions,--blundering only the more deeply when trying\r\nto be literally exact in reporting conversations or portraying\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt has been shrewdly said, that, \"when the Lord wants anything done\r\nin this world, he makes a man a little wrong-headed in the right\r\ndirection.\" With this goes the disposition to overestimate the\r\nimportance of one's work and to push principles and theories towards\r\nextremes. The saying is true of some individuals at or before certain\r\ncrises in affairs; it is not true of the great inevitable historical\r\nmovements, any more than the history of revolutions is the history of\r\nnations. Halifax is called a trimmer. William Wilberforce was a\r\nreformer. Each did a great work. But it would be simply absurd,\r\nexcept in the estimation of the moral purist, to call Wilberforce as\r\ngreat a man or as great an historical and influential person as\r\nHalifax. Halifax saw and acted in the clear light and large relations\r\nin which the great historian of our own times wrote the history of\r\nthe Stuarts. Wilberforce was a purer man, who acted more\r\nconscientiously and persistently within his smaller range of life and\r\nthought. It would have been inconsistent with Mr. Choate's nature for\r\nhim to have been \"wrong-headed\" in any direction. Such largeness of\r\nview, such dramatic and interpretative imagination, such volatile\r\nplay of thought and fancy, and such perception of the pettiness and\r\nhollowness of nearly all the aims and ambitions of daily life we\r\ncannot expect to find coexisting with the coarser \"blood-sympathies,\"\r\nthe direct passion, and the dogged and tenacious hold of temporary\r\nand smaller objects and issues, which distinguish the American\r\npolitician, or with the narrowness of view, the zeal, and the moral\r\npersistency which characterize the practical reformer. There was,\r\ntherefore, in his nature a certain want of the sturdier, harder, and\r\nmore robust elements of character, which, though commonly manifesting\r\nthemselves in connection with self-assertion and partisan zeal, are\r\nindispensable to the man who, in any large and political way, would\r\ntake hold of practical circumstances and work a purpose out of them.\r\nWe admire him for what he was. We do not condemn him for the absence\r\nof qualities not allied to such delicacy and breadth of nature. It is\r\nsimply just to state the fact.\r\n\r\nHe had too little political ambition to seek his own advancement. He\r\nnever could have been a strictly party man. His interest in our\r\npolitics was a patriotic interest in the country. While he recognized\r\nthe necessity of two great parties, he despised the arts and\r\nintrigues of the politician. His modesty, sensibility, large views,\r\nand want of political ambition and partisan spirit prevented\r\ninterest, as they would have precluded success in party management.\r\nHad he spent many years instead of a few in the national Senate, he\r\nnever could have been a leader in its great party struggles. He had\r\nnot the hardier personal and constitutional qualities of mind and\r\ncharacter which lead and control deliberative bodies in great crises.\r\nHe would not have had that statesmanlike prescience which in the case\r\nof Lord Chatham and others seems separable from great general scope\r\nof thought, and which one is tempted to call a faculty for\r\ngovernment. But he must have been influential; for, besides being the\r\nmost eloquent man in the Senate, his speeches would have been\r\ndistinguished for amplitude and judgment in design, and for tact and\r\npersuasiveness in enforcement. They might not have had immediate and\r\ncommanding effect, but they would have had permanent value. His\r\nspeech upon the Ashburton Treaty indicates the powers he would have\r\nshown, with a longer training in the Senate. More than ten years had\r\npassed between that speech and his two speeches in the Massachusetts\r\nConstitutional Convention, upon Representation and the Judiciary, and\r\nin that time a great maturing and solidifying work had been going on\r\nin his mind. Indeed, it was one sure test of his genius, that his\r\nintellect plainly grew to the day of his death. We would point to\r\nthose two speeches as giving some adequate expression of his ability\r\nto treat large subjects simply, profoundly, artistically, and\r\nconvincingly. Many of his earlier and some of his later speeches and\r\naddresses, though large in conception and stamped with unmistakable\r\ngenius, want solid body of thought, and are, so to speak, too fluid\r\nin style. This obviously springs from the qualities of mind and from\r\nthe circumstances we have indicated. In court, the necessities of his\r\ncase and the determination and shaping of all his argument and\r\npersuasion to convincing twelve men, or a court only, on questions\r\nrequiring prompt decision, kept his style free from everything\r\nforeign to his purpose. But, released from these restraints, and\r\ncalled upon for a treatment more general and comprehensive than acute\r\nand discriminating, his style often became inflamed and decorated\r\nwith sensibility and fancy. His mind, moreover, was overtasked in his\r\nprofession. His unremitting mental labor in the preparation and trial\r\nof so many cases was immense and exhausting. It shortened his life.\r\nThat his genius might have that free and joyous exercise necessary to\r\nits full use and exhibition in literary or political directions, an\r\nabandonment of a great part of his professional duties was\r\nindispensable. This was to him neither possible nor desirable. The\r\nmental heat and pressure, therefore, under which he wrote his\r\nspeeches and addresses, and the necessity for the exercise of\r\ndifferent methods of thought and treatment from those called into\r\nplay at the bar, explain why (with a few noble exceptions) they do\r\nnot give a fair or full exhibition of his genius and accomplishments.\r\nBut in them his judgment never lost its anchorage. Unlike Burke, who\r\nwas the god of his political idolatry, his sensibility never\r\novermastered his reasoning. Through a style sometimes Eastern in\r\nflush and fervor, and again tropical in heat and luxuriance, were\r\nalways seen the adjusting and attempering habit of thought and\r\nargument and the even balance of his mind.\r\n\r\nWe have said that his interest in politics was a patriotic interest\r\nin the nation. He knew her history and her triumphs and reverses on\r\nland and sea by heart. Though limited by no narrow love of country,\r\nhe felt from sentiment and imagination that attachment to every\r\nsymbol of patriotism and national power which makes the sailor suffer\r\ndeath with joy when he sees his country's flag floating in the smoke\r\nof victory. \"The radiant ensign of the Republic\" was to him the\r\nliving embodiment of her honor and her power. He had for it the pride\r\nand passion of the boy, with the prophetic hopes of the patriot. Men\r\nof genius are ever revivifying the commonplace expressions and\r\nvisible signs of popular enthusiasm with the poetic and historic\r\nrealities which gave them birth. He felt the glow and impulse of the\r\ngreat sentiments of race and nationality in all their natural\r\nsimplicity and poetic force. It is not now the time to discuss Mr.\r\nChoate's political preferences and opinions. No one who knew him well\r\ncan hesitate to pronounce his motives pure and patriotic. We could\r\nnot come to his conclusions on the policy and duty of our people at\r\nthe last Presidential election. Our duties to the Union forced us to\r\nregard as paramount what he regarded as subsidiary. Our fear for the\r\nUnion sprang from other sources than his. But we believe he acted\r\nfrom the highest convictions of duty, and he certainly exposed\r\nhimself with unflinching courage to obloquy and misinterpretation\r\nwhen silence would have been easy and safe.\r\n\r\nIn what we have said of him as a lawyer we are sure that in every\r\nessential respect we have not overstated or misstated his powers and\r\ncharacteristics as they were known and conceded by lawyers and judges\r\nin Massachusetts. We have confined ourselves mainly to his\r\njury-trials, because into them he threw the whole force and vitality of\r\nhis nature, and because we could thus more completely indicate the\r\nvariety of his accomplishments and the essential characteristics of\r\nhis genius and individuality. A knowledge of them is indispensable to\r\na just estimate of the man, and it must die with him and his hearers,\r\nexcepting only as it may be preserved by contemporaneous written\r\ncriticism and judgment, and by indeterminate and shadowy tradition.\r\n\r\nThe labors of so great a lawyer are as much more useful as they are\r\nless conspicuous than those of any prominent politician or\r\nlegislator, unless he be one of the very few who have high\r\nconstructive or creative ability. There is little risk of\r\noverestimating the value of a life devoted to mastering that complex\r\nsystem of jurisprudence, the old, ever-expanding, and ever-improving\r\ncommon law which is interwoven with our whole fabric of government,\r\nproperty, and personal rights, and to applying it profoundly through\r\ntrial by jury and before courts of law, not merely that justice may\r\nbe obtained for clients, but that decisions shall be made determining\r\nthe rights and duties of men for generations to come. And when such a\r\nlife is not only full of immense work and achievement, but\r\nis penetrated and informed with genius, sensibility, and\r\nloving-kindness, it passes sweetly and untraceably, but influentially\r\nand immortally, into the life of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGICIDE COLONELS IN NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the restoration of Charles the Second, in 1660, to the throne\r\nof his ancestors, he had issued a \"Declaration,\" promising to all\r\npersons but such as should be excepted by Parliament a pardon of\r\noffences committed during the late disorderly times. In the\r\nParliamentary Act of Indemnity which followed, such as had been\r\ndirectly concerned in the death of the late King were excepted from\r\nmercy. Colonel Whalley and Colonel Goffe were members of the High\r\nCourt of Justice which convicted and sentenced him. It was known that\r\nthey had fled from England; and one Captain Breedon, lately returned\r\nfrom Boston, reported that he had seen them there. The Ministry sent\r\nan order to Endicott, the Governor of Massachusetts, for their\r\napprehension and transportation to England.\r\n\r\nThe friendly welcome which had in fact been extended to the\r\ndistinguished fugitives cannot be confidently interpreted as an\r\nindication of favorable judgment of the act by which their lives were\r\nnow endangered. No one of the New-England Colonies had formally\r\nexpressed approval of the execution of King Charles the First, nor is\r\nthere any other evidence of its having been generally regarded by\r\nthem with favor. It is likely that in New England, as in the parent\r\ncountry, the opinions of patriotic men were divided in respect to the\r\ncharacter of that measure. In New England, remote as it was from the\r\nscene of those crimes which had provoked so extreme a proceeding, it\r\nmay be presumed that there was greater difficulty in admitting the\r\nforce of the reasons, by which it was vindicated. And the sympathy of\r\nNew England would be more likely to be with Vane, who condemned it,\r\nthan with Cromwell. But the strangers, however one act of theirs\r\nmight be regarded, had been eminent among those who had fought for\r\nthe rights of Englishmen, and they brought introductions from men\r\nvenerated and beloved by the people among whom a refuge was sought.\r\n\r\nEdward Whalley, a younger son of a good family, first cousin of the\r\nProtector Oliver, and of John Hampden, distinguished himself at the\r\nBattle of Naseby as an officer of cavalry, and was presently promoted\r\nby Parliament to the command of a regiment. He commanded at the storm\r\nof Banbury, and at the first capture of Worcester. He was intrusted\r\nwith the custody of the King's person at Hampton Court; he sat in the\r\nHigh Court of Justice at the trial of Charles, and was one of the\r\nsigners of the death-warrant. After the Battle of Dunbar, at which he\r\nagain won renown, Cromwell left him in Scotland in command of four\r\nregiments of horse. He was one of the Major-Generals among whom the\r\nkingdom was parcelled out by one of the Protector's last\r\narrangements, and as such governed the Counties of Lincoln,\r\nNottingham, Derby, Warwick, and Leicester. He sat as a member for\r\nNottinghamshire in Cromwell's Second and Third Parliaments, and was\r\ncalled up to \"the other House\" when that body was constituted.\r\n\r\nWilliam Goffe, son of a Puritan clergyman in Sussex, was a member of\r\nParliament, and a colonel of infantry soon after the breaking out of\r\nthe Civil War. He married a daughter of Whalley. Like his\r\nfather-in-law, he was a member of the High Court of Justice for the\r\nKing's trial, a signer of the warrant for his execution, a member of the\r\nProtector's Third and Fourth Parliaments, and then a member of \"the\r\nother House.\" He commanded Cromwell's regiment at the Battle of\r\nDunbar, and rendered service particularly acceptable to him in the\r\nsecond expurgation of Parliament. As one of the ten Major-Generals,\r\nhe held the government of Hampshire, Berkshire, and Sussex.\r\n\r\nWhen Whalley and Goffe, upon the King's return, left England to\r\nescape what they apprehended might prove the fate of regicides, the\r\npolicy of the Court in respect to persons circumstanced as they were\r\nhad not been promulgated. Arriving in Boston, in July, and having\r\nbeen courteously welcomed by the Governor, they proceeded the same\r\nday to Cambridge, which place for the present they made their home.\r\nFor several months they appeared there freely in public. They\r\nattended the public religious meetings, and others held at private\r\nhouses, at which latter they prayed, and _prophesied_, or preached.\r\nThey visited some of the principal towns in the neighborhood, were\r\noften in Boston, and were received, wherever they went, with\r\ndistinguished attention.\r\n\r\nAt the end of four months, intelligence came to Massachusetts of the\r\nAct of Indemnity, and that Whalley and Goffe were among those\r\nexcepted from it, and marked for vengeance. Three months longer they\r\nlived at Cambridge unmolested; but in the mean while affairs had been\r\ngrowing critical between Massachusetts and the mother country, and,\r\nthough some members of the General Court assured them of protection,\r\nothers thought it more prudent that they should have a hint to\r\nprovide for their safety in some way which would not imply an affront\r\nto the royal government on the part of the Colony. The Governor\r\ncalled a Court of Assistants, in February, and without secrecy asked\r\ntheir advice respecting his obligation to secure the refugees. The\r\nCourt refused to recommend that measure, and four days more passed,\r\nat the end of which time--whether induced by the persuasion of\r\nothers, or by their own conviction of the impropriety of involving\r\ntheir generous hosts in further embarrassment, or simply because they\r\nhad been awaiting till then the completion of arrangements for their\r\nreception at New Haven--they set off for that place.\r\n\r\nA journey of nine days brought them to the hospitable house of the\r\nReverend Mr. Davenport, where again they moved freely in the society\r\nof the ministers and the magistrates. But they had scarcely been at\r\nNew Haven three weeks, when tidings came thither of the reception at\r\nBoston of a proclamation issued by the King for their arrest. To\r\nrelease their host from responsibility, they went to Milford, (as if\r\non their way to New Netherland,) and there showed themselves in\r\npublic; but returned secretly the same night to New Haven, and were\r\nconcealed in Davenport's house. This was towards the last of March.\r\n\r\nThey had been so situated a month, when their friends had information\r\nfrom Boston that the search for them was to be undertaken in earnest.\r\nFurther accounts of their having been seen in that place had reached\r\nEngland, and the King had sent a peremptory order to the Colonial\r\ngovernments for their apprehension. Endicott, to whom it was\r\ntransmitted, could do no less than appear to interest himself to\r\nexecute it; and this he might do with the less reluctance, because,\r\nunder the circumstances, there was small likelihood that his\r\nexertions would be effectual. Two young English merchants, Thomas\r\nKellond and Thomas Kirk, received from him a commission to prosecute\r\nthe search in Massachusetts, and were also furnished with letters of\r\nrecommendation to the Governors of the other Colonies. That they were\r\nzealous Royalists, direct from England, would be some evidence to the\r\nhome government that the quest would be pursued in good faith. That\r\nthey were foreigners, unacquainted with the roads and with the habits\r\nof the country, and betraying themselves by their deportment wherever\r\nthey should go in New England, would afford comfortable assurance to\r\nthe Governor that they would pursue their quest in vain.\r\n\r\nFrom Boston, the pursuivants, early in May, went to Hartford, where\r\nthey were informed by Winthrop, Governor of Connecticut, that \"the\r\nColonels,\" as they were called, had passed thence immediately before,\r\non their way to New Haven. Thither the messengers proceeded, stopping\r\non the way at Guilford, the residence of Deputy-Governor Leete. Since\r\nthe recent death of Governor Newman, Leete had been Chief Magistrate\r\nof the Colony of New Haven, which was now, and for a few years later,\r\ndistinct from Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Governor received them in the presence of several other\r\npersons. He looked over their papers, and then \"began to read them\r\naudibly; whereupon we told him,\" say the messengers, \"it was\r\nconvenient to be more private in such concernments as that was.\" They\r\ndesired to be furnished \"with horses, &c.,\" for their further\r\njourney, \"which was prepared with some delays.\" They were accosted,\r\non coming out, by a person who told them that the Colonels were\r\nsecreted at Mr. Davenport's, \"and that, without all question, Deputy\r\nLeete knew as much\"; and that \"in the head of a company in the field\r\na-training,\" it had lately been \"openly spoken by them, that, if they\r\nhad but two hundred friends that would stand by them, they would not\r\ncare for Old or New England.\"\r\n\r\nThe messengers returned to Leete, and made an application for \"aid\r\nand a power to search and apprehend\" the fugitives. \"He refused to\r\ngive any power to apprehend them, nor order any other, and said he\r\ncould do nothing until he had spoken with one Mr. Gilbert and the\r\nrest of his magistrates.\" New Haven, the seat of government of the\r\nColony, was twenty miles distant from Guilford. It was now Saturday\r\nafternoon, and for a New-England Governor to break the Sabbath by\r\nsetting off on a journey, or by procuring horses for any other\r\ntraveller, was impossible. An Indian was observed to have left\r\nGuilford while the parley was going on, and was supposed to have gone\r\non an errand to New Haven.\r\n\r\nMonday morning the messengers proceeded thither. \"To our certain\r\nknowledge,\" they write, \"one John Meigs was sent a-horseback before\r\nus, and by his speedy and unexpected going so early before day was to\r\ngive them an information, and the rather because by the delays was\r\nused, it was break of day before we got to horse; so he got there\r\nbefore us. Upon our suspicion, we required the Deputy that the said\r\nJohn Meigs might be examined what his business was, that might\r\noccasion so early going; to which the Deputy answered, that he did\r\nnot know any such thing, and refused to examine him.\" Leete was in no\r\nhaste to make his own journey to the capital. It was for the\r\nmessengers to judge whether they would use such despatch as to give\r\nan alarm there some time before any magistrate was present, to be\r\ninvoked for aid. He arrived, they write, \"within two hours, or\r\nthereabouts, after us and came to us to the Court chamber, where we\r\nagain acquainted him with the information we had received, and that\r\nwe had cause to believe they [the fugitives] were concealed in New\r\nHaven, and thereupon we required his assistance and aid for their\r\napprehension; to which he answered, that he did not believe they\r\nwere; whereupon we desired him to empower us, or order others for it;\r\nto which he gave us this answer, the he could not, or would not, make\r\nus magistrates... We set before him the danger of that delay and\r\ntheir inevitable escape, and how much the honor and service of his\r\nMajesty was despised and trampled on by him, and that we supposed by\r\nhis unwillingness to assist in the apprehension he was willing they\r\nshould escape. After which he left us, and went to several of the\r\nmagistrates, and were together five or six hours in consultation, and\r\nupon breaking up of their council they told us they would not nor\r\ncould not to anything until they had called a General Court of the\r\nfreemen.\"\r\n\r\nThe messengers labored with great earnestness to shake this\r\ndetermination, but all in vain. For precedents they appealed to the\r\npromptness of the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut, \"who,\r\nupon the recite of his Majesty's pleasure and order concerning the\r\nsaid persons, stood not upon such niceties and formalities.\" They\r\nrepresented \"how much the honor and justice of his Majesty was\r\nconcerned, and how ill his Sacred Majesty would resent such horrid\r\nand detestable concealments and abettings of such traitors and\r\nregicides as they were, and asked him whether he would honor and obey\r\nthe King or no in this affair, and set before him the danger which by\r\nlaw is incurred by any one that conceals or abets traitors; to which\r\nthe Deputy Leete answered, 'We honor his Majesty, but we have tender\r\nconsciences'; to which we replied, that we believed that he knew\r\nwhere they were, and only pretended tenderness of conscience for a\r\nrefusal.... We told them that for their respect to two traitors they\r\nwould do themselves injury, and possibly ruin themselves and the\r\nwhole Colony of New Haven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finding them obstinate and pertinacious in their contempt of his\r\nMajesty,\" the messengers, probably misled by some false information,\r\ntook the road to New Netherland, the next day, in further prosecution\r\nof their business. The Dutch Governor at that place promised them,\r\nthat, if the Colonels appeared within his jurisdiction, he would give\r\nnotice to Endicott, and take measures to prevent their escape by sea.\r\nThereupon Kellond and Kirk returned by water to Boston, where they\r\nmade oath before the magistrates to a report of their proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives had received timely notice of the chase. A week before\r\nKellond and Kirk left Boston, they removed from Mr. Davenport's house\r\nto that of William Jones, son-in-law of Governor Eaton, and\r\nafterwards Deputy-Governor of Connecticut. On the day when the\r\nmessengers were debating with Governor Leete at Guilford, Whalley and\r\nGoffe were conducted to a mill, at a short distance from New Haven,\r\nwhere they were hidden two days and nights. Thence they were led to a\r\nspot called Hatchet Harbor, about as much farther in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, where they lay two nights more. Meantime, for fear of the\r\neffect of the large rewards which the messengers had offered for\r\ntheir capture, a more secure hiding-place had been provided for them\r\nin a hollow on the east side of West Rock, five miles from the town.\r\nIn this retreat they remained four weeks, being supplied with food\r\nfrom a lonely farm-house in the neighborhood, to which they also\r\nsometimes withdrew in stormy weather. They caused the Deputy-Governor\r\nto be informed of their hiding-place; and on hearing that Mr.\r\nDavenport was in danger from a suspicion of harboring them, they left\r\nit, and for a week or two showed themselves at different times at New\r\nHaven and elsewhere. After two months more of concealment in their\r\nretreat on the side of West Bock, they betook themselves, just after\r\nthe middle of August, to the house of one Tomkins, in or near\r\nMilford. There they remained in complete secrecy for two years, after\r\nwhich time they indulged themselves in more freedom, and even\r\nconducted the devotions of a few neighbors assembled in their\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nBut the arrival at Boston of Commissioners from the King with\r\nextraordinary powers was now expected, and it was likely that they\r\nwould be charged to institute a new search, which might endanger the\r\nfugitives, and would certainly be embarrassing to their protectors.\r\nJust at this time a feud in the churches of Hartford and Wethersfield\r\nhad led to an emigration to a spot of fertile meadow forty miles\r\nfarther up the river. Mr. Russell, hitherto minister of Wethersfield,\r\naccompanied the new settlers as their pastor. The General Court gave\r\ntheir town the name of Hadley. In this remotest northwestern frontier\r\nof New England a refuge was prepared for the fugitives. On hearing of\r\nthe arrival of the Commissioners at Boston, they withdrew to their\r\ncave; but some Indians in hunting observed that it had been occupied,\r\nand its secrecy could no longer be counted on. They consequently\r\ndirected their steps towards Hadley, travelling only by night, and\r\nthere, in the month of October, 1664, were received into the house of\r\nMr. Russell.\r\n\r\nThere--except for a remarkable momentary appearance of one of them,\r\nand except for the visits of a few confidential friends--they\r\nremained lost forever to the view of men. Presents were made to them\r\nby leading persons among the colonists, and they received remittances\r\nfrom friends in England. Governor Hutchinson, when he wrote his\r\nHistory, had in his hands the Diary of Goffe, begun at the time of\r\ntheir leaving London, and continued for six or seven years. They were\r\nfor a time encouraged by a belief, founded on their interpretation of\r\nthe Apocalypse, that the execution of their comrades was \"the slaying\r\nof the witnesses,\" and that their own triumph was speedily to follow.\r\nLetters passed between Goffe and his wife, purporting to be between a\r\nson and mother, and signed respectively with the names of Walter and\r\nFrances Goldsmith. Four of these letters survive; tender,\r\nmagnanimous, and devout, they are scarcely to be read without tears.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth year of his abode at Hadley Whalley had become extremely\r\ninfirm in mind and body, and he probably did not outlive that year.\r\nMr. Russell's house was standing till within a little more than half\r\na century ago. At its demolition, the removal of a slab in the cellar\r\ndiscovered human remains of a large size. They are believed to have\r\nbelonged to the stout frame which swept through Prince Rupert's lines\r\nat Naseby. Goffe survived his father-in-law nearly five years, at\r\nleast; how much longer, is not known. Once he was seen abroad, after\r\nhis retirement to Mr. Russell's house. The dreadful war, to which the\r\nIndian King Philip bequeathed his long execrated name, was raging\r\nwith its worst terrors in the autumn of 1675. On the first day of\r\nSeptember, the people of Hadley kept a fast, to implore the Divine\r\nprotection in their distress. While they were engaged in their\r\nworship, a sentry's shot gave notice that the stealthy savages were\r\nupon them. Hutchinson, in his History, relates what follows, as he\r\nhad received it from the family of Governor Leverett, who was one of\r\nthe few visitors of Goffe in his retreat. \"The people were in the\r\nutmost confusion. Suddenly a grave, elderly person appeared in the\r\nmidst of them. In his mien and dress he differed from the rest of the\r\npeople. He not only encouraged them to defend themselves, but put\r\nhimself at their head, rallied, instructed, and led them on to\r\nencounter the enemy, who by this means were repulsed. As suddenly the\r\ndeliverer of Hadley disappeared. The people were left in\r\nconsternation, utterly unable to account for this strange phenomenon.\r\nIt is not probable that they were ever able to explain it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first years of the retirement of the Colonels at Hadley, they\r\nenjoyed the society of a former friend, who did not feel obliged to\r\nuse the same strict precautions against discovery. John Dixwell, like\r\nthemselves, was a colonel in the Parliamentary service, a member of\r\nthe High Court of Justice, and a signer of the death-warrant of the\r\nKing. Nothing is known of his proceedings after the restoration of\r\nthe monarchy, till he came to Hadley, three or four months later than\r\nWhalley and Goffe. After a residence of some years in their\r\nneighborhood, he removed to New Haven, where, bearing the name of\r\nJames Davids, and affecting no particular privacy, he lived to old\r\nage. The home-government never traced him to America; and though,\r\namong his acquaintance, it was understood that he had a secret to\r\nkeep, there was no disposition to penetrate it. He married twice at\r\nNew Haven, and by his second nuptials established a family, one\r\nbranch of which survives. In testamentary documents, as well as in\r\ncommunications, while he lived, to his minister and others, he\r\nfrankly made known his character and history. He died just too early\r\nto hear the tidings, which would have renewed his strength like the\r\neagle's, of the expulsion of the House of Stuart. A fit monument\r\ndirects the traveller to the place of his burial, in the square\r\nbounded on one side by the halls of Yale College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CAT-BIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  You, who would with wanton art\r\n  Counterfeit another's part,\r\n  And with noisy utterance claim\r\n  Right to an ignoble name,--\r\n  Inharmonious!--why must you,\r\n  To a better self untrue,\r\n  Gifted with the charm of song,\r\n  Do the generous gift such wrong?\r\n\r\n  Delicate and downy throat,\r\n  Shaped for pure, melodious note,--\r\n  Silvery wing of softest gray,--\r\n  Bright eyes glancing every way,--\r\n  Graceful outline,--motion free:\r\n  Types of perfect harmony!\r\n\r\n  Ah! you much mistake your duty,\r\n  Mating discord thus with beauty,--\r\n  'Mid these heavenly sunset gleams,\r\n  Vexing the smooth air with screams,--\r\n  Burdening the dainty breeze\r\n  With insane discordancies.\r\n\r\n  I have heard you tell a tale\r\n  Tender as the nightingale,\r\n  Sweeter than the early thrush\r\n  Pipes at day-dawn from the bush.\r\n  Wake once more the liquid strain\r\n  That you poured, like music-rain,\r\n  When, last night, in the sweet weather,\r\n  You and I were out together.\r\n  Unto whom two notes are given,\r\n  One of earth, and one of heaven,\r\n  Were it not a shameful tale\r\n  That the earth-note should prevail?\r\n\r\n  For the sake of those who love us,\r\n  For the sake of God above us,\r\n  Each and all should do their best\r\n  To make music for the rest.\r\n  So will I no more reprove,\r\n  Though the chiding be in love:\r\n  Uttering harsh rebuke to you,\r\n  That were inharmonious, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCURIOSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople will talk. _Ciascun lo dice_ is a tune that is played oftener\r\nthan the national air of this country or any other.\r\n\r\n\"That's what they say. Means to marry her, if she _is_ his cousin.\r\nGot money himself,--that's the story,--but wants to come and live in\r\nthe old place, and get the Dudley property by-and-by.\"--\"Mother's\r\nfolks was wealthy.\"--\"Twenty-three to twenty-five year old.\"--\"He\r\na'n't more'n twenty, or twenty-one at the outside.\"--\"Looks as if he\r\nknew too much to be only twenty year old.\"--\"Guess he's been through\r\nthe mill,--don't look so green, anyhow,--hey? Did y' ever mind that\r\ncut over his left eyebrow?\"\r\n\r\nSo they gossipped in Rockland. The young fellows could make nothing\r\nof Dick Venner. He was shy and proud with the few who made advances\r\nto him. The young ladies called him handsome and romantic, but he\r\nlooked at them like a many-tailed pacha who was in the habit of\r\nordering his wives by the dozen.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the young man over there at the Venners'?\" said\r\nMiss Arabella Thornton to her father.\r\n\r\n\"Handsome,\" said the Judge, \"but dangerous-looking. His face is\r\nindictable at common law. Do you know, my dear, I think there is a\r\nblank at the Sheriff's office, with a place for his name in it?\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge paused and looked grave, as if he had just listened to the\r\nverdict of the jury and was going to pronounce sentence.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard anything against him?\" said the Judge's daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. But I don't like these mixed bloods and half-told stories.\r\nBesides, I have seen a good many desperate fellows at the bar, and I\r\nhave a fancy they all have a look belonging to them. The worst one I\r\never sentenced looked a good deal like this fellow. A wicked mouth.\r\nAll our other features are made for us; but a man makes his own\r\nmouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the person you sentenced?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a young fellow that undertook to garrote a man who had won\r\nhis money at cards. The same slender shape, the same cunning, fierce\r\nlook, smoothed over with a plausible air. Depend upon it, there is an\r\nexpression in all the sort of people that live by their wits when\r\nthey can, and by worse weapons when their wits fail them, that we old\r\nlaw-doctors know just as well as the medical counselors know the\r\nmarks of disease in a man's face. Dr. Kittredge looks at a man and\r\nsays he is going to die; I look at another man and say he is going to\r\nbe hanged, if nothing happens. I don't say so of this one, but I\r\ndon't like his looks. I wonder Dudley Venner takes to him so kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all for Elsie's sake,\" said Miss Thornton; \"I feel quite sure\r\nof that. He never does anything that is not meant for her in some\r\nway. I suppose it amuses her to have her cousin about the house. She\r\nrides a good deal since he has been here. Have you seen them\r\ngalloping about together? He looks like my idea of a Spanish bandit\r\non that wild horse of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly he has been one,--or is one,\" said the Judge,--smiling as\r\nmen smile whose lips have often been freighted with the life and\r\ndeath of their fellow-creatures. \"I met them riding the other day.\r\nPerhaps Dudley is right, if it pleases her to have a companion. What\r\nwill happen, though, if he makes love to her? Will Elsie be easily\r\ntaken with such a fellow? You young folks are supposed to know more\r\nabout these matters than we middle-aged people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can tell. Elsie is not like anybody else. The girls that have\r\nseen most of her think she hates men, all but 'Dudley,' as she calls\r\nher father. Some of them doubt whether she loves him. They doubt\r\nwhether she can love anything human, except perhaps the old black\r\nwoman that has taken care of her since she was a baby. The village\r\npeople have the strangest stories about her: you know what they call\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\nShe whispered three words in her father's ear. The Judge changed\r\ncolor as she spoke, sighed deeply, and was silent as if lost in\r\nthought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I remember her mother,\" he said, \"so well! A sweeter creature never\r\nlived. Elsie has something of her in her look, but those are not the\r\nDudley eyes. They were dark, but soft, in all I ever saw of the race.\r\nHer father's are dark too, but mild, and even tender, I should say. I\r\ndon't know what there is about Elsie's,--but do you know, my dear, I\r\nfind myself curiously influenced by them? I have had to face a good\r\nmany sharp eyes and hard ones,--murderers' eyes and pirates',--men\r\nthat had to be watched in the bar, where they stood on trial, for\r\nfear they should spring on the prosecuting officers like tigers,--but\r\nI never saw such eyes as Elsie's; and yet they have a kind of drawing\r\nvirtue or power about them,--I don't know what else to call it: have\r\nyou never observed this?\"\r\n\r\nHis daughter smiled in her turn.\r\n\r\n\"Never observed it? Why, of course, nobody could be with Elsie Venner\r\nand not observe it. There are a good many other strange things about\r\nher: did you ever notice how she dresses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, handsomely enough, I should think,\" the Judge answered. \"I\r\nsuppose she dresses as she likes, and sends to the city for what she\r\nwants. What do you mean in particular? We men notice effects in\r\ndress, but not much in detail.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never noticed the colors and patterns of her dresses? You never\r\nremarked anything curious about her ornaments? Well! I don't believe\r\nyou men know, half the time, whether a lady wears a ninepenny collar\r\nor a thread-lace cape worth a thousand dollars. I don't believe you\r\nknow a silk dress from a bombazine one. I don't believe you can tell\r\nwhether a woman is in black or in colors, unless you happen to know\r\nshe is a widow. Elsie Venner has a strange taste in dress, let me\r\ntell you. She sends for the oddest patterns of stuffs, and picks out\r\nthe most curious things at the jeweller's, whenever she goes to town\r\nwith her father. They say the old Doctor tells him to let her have\r\nher way about all such matters. Afraid of her mind, if she is\r\ncontradicted, I suppose.--You've heard about her going to school at\r\nthat place,--the 'Institoot,' as those people call it? They say she's\r\nbright enough in her way,--has studied at home, you know, with her\r\nfather a good deal,--knows some modern languages and Latin, I\r\nbelieve: at any rate, she would have it so,--she must go to the\r\n'Institoot.' They have a very good female teacher there, I hear; and\r\nthe new master, that young Mr. Langdon, looks and talks like a\r\nwell-educated young man. I wonder what they'll make of Elsie, between\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nSo they talked at the Judge's, in the calm, judicial-looking\r\nmansion-house, in the grave, still library, with the troops of wan-hued\r\nlaw-books staring blindly out of their titles at them as they talked,\r\nlike the ghosts of dead attorneys fixed motionless and speechless,\r\neach with a thin, golden film over his unwinking eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, everything went on quietly enough after Cousin\r\nRichard's return. A man of sense,--that is, a man who knows perfectly\r\nwell that a cool head is worth a dozen warm hearts in carrying the\r\nfortress of a woman's affections, (not yours, \"Astarte,\" nor yours,\r\n\"Viola,\")--who knows that men are rejected by women every day because\r\nthey, the men, love them, and are accepted every day because they do\r\nnot, and therefore can study the arts of pleasing,--a man of sense,\r\nwhen he finds he has established his second parallel too soon,\r\nretires quietly to his first, and begins working on his covered ways\r\nagain. [The whole art of love may be read in any Encyclopaedia under\r\nthe title _Fortification_, where the terms just used are explained.]\r\nAfter the little adventure of the necklace, Dick retreated at once to\r\nhis first parallel. Elsie loved riding,--and would go off with him on\r\na gallop now and then. He was a master of all those strange Indian\r\nhorseback-feats which shame the tricks of the circus-riders, and used\r\nto astonish and almost amuse her sometimes by disappearing from his\r\nsaddle, like a phantom horseman, lying flat against the side of the\r\nbounding creature that bore him, as if he were a hunting leopard with\r\nhis claws in the horse's flank and flattening himself out against his\r\nheaving ribs. Elsie knew a little Spanish too, which she had learned\r\nfrom the young person who had taught her dancing, and Dick enlarged\r\nher vocabulary with a few soft phrases, and would sing her a song\r\nsometimes, touching the air upon an ancient-looking guitar they had\r\nfound with the ghostly things in the garret,--a quaint old\r\ninstrument, marked E.M. on the back, and supposed to have belonged to\r\na certain Elizabeth Mascarene, before mentioned in connection with a\r\nwork of art,--a fair, dowerless lady, who smiled and sung and faded\r\naway, unwedded, a hundred years ago, as dowerless ladies, not a few,\r\nare smiling and singing and fading now,--God grant each of them His\r\nlove,--and one human heart as its interpreter!\r\n\r\nAs for school, Elsie went or stayed away as she liked. Sometimes,\r\nwhen they thought she was at her desk in the great school-room, she\r\nwould be on The Mountain,--alone always. Dick wanted to go with her,\r\nbut she would never let him. Once, when she had followed the zigzag\r\npath a little way up, she looked back and caught a glimpse of him\r\nfollowing her. She turned and passed him without a word, but giving\r\nhim a look which seemed to make the scars on his wrist tingle, went\r\nto her room, where she locked herself up, and did not come out again\r\ntill evening,--old Sophy having brought her food, and set it down,\r\nnot speaking, but looking into her eyes inquiringly, like a dumb\r\nbeast trying to feel out his master's will in his face. The evening\r\nwas clear and the moon shining. As Dick sat at his chamber-window,\r\nlooking at the mountain-side, he saw a gray-dressed figure flit\r\nbetween the trees and steal along the narrow path that led upward.\r\nElsie's pillow was impressed that night, but she had not been missed\r\nby the household,--for Dick knew enough to keep his own counsel. The\r\nnext morning she avoided him and went off early to school. It was the\r\nsame morning that the young master found the flower between the\r\nleaves of his Virgil.\r\n\r\nThe girl got over her angry fit, and was pleasant enough with her\r\ncousin for a few days after this; but she shunned rather than sought\r\nhim. She had taken a new interest in her books, and especially in\r\ncertain poetical readings which the master conducted with the elder\r\nscholars. This gave Master Langdon a good chance to study her ways\r\nwhen her eye was on her book, to notice the inflections of her voice,\r\nto watch for any expression of her sentiments; for, to tell the\r\ntruth, he had a kind of fear that the girl had taken a fancy to him,\r\nand, though she interested him, he did not wish to study her heart\r\nfrom the inside.\r\n\r\nThe more he saw her, the more the sadness of her beauty wrought upon\r\nhim. She looked as if she might hate, but could not love. She hardly\r\nsmiled at anything, spoke rarely, but seemed to feel that her natural\r\npower of expression lay all in her bright eyes, the force of which so\r\nmany had felt, but none perhaps had tried to explain to themselves. A\r\nperson accustomed to watch the faces of those who were ailing in body\r\nor mind, and to search in every line and tint for some underlying\r\nsource of disorder, could hardly help analyzing the impression such a\r\nface produced upon him. The light of those beautiful eyes was like\r\nthe lustre of ice; in all her features there was nothing of that\r\nhuman warmth which shows that sympathy has reached the soul beneath\r\nthe mask of flesh it wears. The look was that of remoteness, of utter\r\nisolation. There was in its stony apathy, it seemed to him, the\r\npathos which we find in the blind who show no film or speck over the\r\norgans of sight; for Nature had meant her to be lovely, and left out\r\nnothing but love. And yet the master could not help feeling that some\r\ninstinct was working in this girl which was in some way leading her\r\nto seek his presence. She did not lift her glittering eyes upon him\r\nas at first. It seemed strange that she did not, for they were surely\r\nher natural weapons of conquest. Her color did not come and go like\r\nthat of young girls under excitement. She had a clear brunette\r\ncomplexion, a little sun-touched, it may be,--for the master noticed\r\nonce, when her necklace was slightly displaced, that a faint ring or\r\nband of a little lighter shade than the rest of the surface encircled\r\nher neck. What was the slight peculiarity of her enunciation, when\r\nshe read? Not a lisp, certainly, but the least possible imperfection\r\nin articulating some of the lingual sounds,--just enough to be\r\nnoticed at first, and quite forgotten after being a few times heard.\r\n\r\nNot a word about the flower on either side. It was not uncommon for\r\nthe schoolgirls to leave a rose or pink or wild flower on the\r\nteacher's desk. Finding it in the Virgil was nothing, after all; it\r\nwas a little delicate flower, that looked as if it were made to\r\npress, and it was probably shut in by accident at the particular\r\nplace where he found it. He took it into his head to examine it in a\r\nbotanical point of view. He found it was not common,--that it grew\r\nonly in certain localities,--and that one of these was among the\r\nrocks of the eastern spur of The Mountain.\r\n\r\nIt happened to come into his head how the Swiss youth climb the sides\r\nof the Alps to find the flower called the _Edelweiss_ for the maidens\r\nwhom they wish to please. It is a pretty fancy, that of scaling some\r\ndangerous height before the dawn, so as to gather the flower in its\r\nfreshness, that the favored maiden may wear it to church on Sunday\r\nmorning, a proof at once of her lover's devotion and his courage. Mr.\r\nBernard determined to explore the region where this flower was said\r\nto grow, that he might see where the wild girl sought the blossoms of\r\nwhich Nature was so jealous.\r\n\r\nIt was on a warm, fair Saturday afternoon that he undertook his\r\nland-voyage of discovery. He had more curiosity, it may be, than he\r\nwould have owned; for he had heard of the girl's wandering habits, and\r\nthe guesses about her sylvan haunts, and was thinking what the chances\r\nwere that he should meet her in some strange place, or come upon\r\ntraces of her which would tell secrets she would not care to have\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe woods are all alive to one who walks through them with his mind\r\nin an excited state, and his eyes and ears wide open. The trees are\r\nalways talking, not merely whispering with their leaves, (for every\r\ntree talks to itself in that way, even when it stands alone in the\r\nmiddle of a pasture,) but grating their boughs against each\r\nother, as old horn-handed farmers press their dry, rustling palms\r\ntogether,--dropping a nut or a leaf or a twig, clicking to the tap of a\r\nwoodpecker, or rustling as a squirrel flashes along a branch. It was\r\nnow the season of singing-birds, and the woods were haunted with\r\nmysterious, tender music. The voices of the birds which love the\r\ndeeper shades of the forest are sadder than those of the open fields:\r\nthese are the nuns that have taken themselves away from the world and\r\ntell their griefs to the infinite listening Silences of the\r\nwilderness,--for the one deep inner silence that Nature breaks with\r\nher fitful superficial sounds becomes multiplied as the image of a\r\nstar in ruffled waters. Strange! The woods at first convey the\r\nimpression of profound repose, and yet, if you watch their ways with\r\nopen ear, you find the life which is in them is restless and nervous\r\nas that of a woman: the little twigs are crossing and twining and\r\nseparating like slender fingers that cannot be still; the stray leaf\r\nis to be flattened into its place like a truant curl; the limbs sway\r\nand twist, impatient of their constrained attitude; and the rounded\r\nmasses of foliage swell upward and subside from time to time with\r\nlong soft sighs, and, it may be, the falling of a few rain-drops\r\nwhich had lain hidden among the deeper shadows. I pray you, notice,\r\nin the sweet summer days which will soon see you among the mountains,\r\nthis inward tranquillity that belongs to the heart of the woodland,\r\nwith this nervousness, for I do not know what else to call it, of\r\nouter movement. One would say, that Nature, like untrained persons,\r\ncould not sit still without nestling about or doing something with\r\nher limbs or features, and that high breeding was only to be looked\r\nfor in trim gardens, where the soul of the trees is ill at ease\r\nperhaps, but their manners are unexceptionable, and a rustling branch\r\nor leaf falling out of season is an indecorum. The real forest is\r\nhardly still except in the Indian summer; then there is death in the\r\nhouse, and they are waiting for the sharp shrunken months to come\r\nwith white raiment for the summer's burial.\r\n\r\nThere were many hemlocks in this neighborhood, the grandest and most\r\nsolemn of all the forest-trees in the mountain regions. Up to a\r\ncertain period of growth they are eminently beautiful, their boughs\r\ndisposed in the most graceful pagoda-like series of close terraces,\r\nthick and dark with green crystalline leaflets. In spring the tender\r\nshoots come out of a paler green, finger-like, as if they were\r\npointing to the violets at their feet. But when the trees have grown\r\nold, and their rough boles measure a yard through their diameter,\r\nthey are no longer beautiful, but they have a sad solemnity all their\r\nown, too full of meaning to require the heart's comment to be framed\r\nin words. Below, all their earthward-looking branches are sapless and\r\nshattered, splintered by the weight of many winters' snows; above,\r\nthey are still green and full of life, but their summits overtop all\r\nthe deciduous trees around them, and in their companionship with\r\nheaven they are alone. On these the lightning loves to fall. One such\r\nMr. Bernard saw,--or rather, what had been one such; for the bolt had\r\ntorn the tree like an explosion from within, and the ground was\r\nstrewed all around the broken stump with flakes of rough bark and\r\nstrips and chips of shivered wood, into which the old tree had been\r\nrent by the bursting rocket from the thunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n----The master had struck up The Mountain obliquely from the western\r\nside of the Dudley mansion-house. In this way he ascended until he\r\nreached a point many hundred feet above the level of the plain, and\r\ncommanding all the country beneath and around. Almost at his feet he\r\nsaw the mansion-house, the chimney standing out of the middle of the\r\nroof, or rather, like a black square hole in it,--the trees almost\r\ndirectly over their stems, the fences as lines, the whole nearly as\r\nan architect would draw a ground-plan of the house and the inclosures\r\nround it. It frightened him to see how the huge masses of rock and\r\nold forest-growths hung over the home below. As he descended a little\r\nand drew near the ledge of evil name, he was struck with the\r\nappearance of a long narrow fissure that ran parallel with it and\r\nabove it for many rods, not seemingly of very old standing,--for\r\nthere were many fibres of roots which had evidently been snapped\r\nasunder when the rent took place, and some of which were still\r\nsucculent in both separated portions.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard had made up his mind, when he set forth, not to come back\r\nbefore he had examined the dreaded ledge. He had half persuaded\r\nhimself that it was scientific curiosity. He wished to examine the\r\nrocks, _to see what flowers grew there_, and perhaps to pick up an\r\nadventure in the zoölogical line; for he had on a pair of high, stout\r\nboots, and he carried a stick in his hand, which was forked at one\r\nextremity, so as to be very convenient to hold down a _crotalus_\r\nwith, if he should happen to encounter one. He knew the aspect of the\r\nledge, from a distance; for its bald and leprous-looking declivities\r\nstood out in their nakedness from the wooded sides of The Mountain,\r\nwhen this was viewed from certain points of the village. But the\r\nnearer aspect of the blasted region had something frightful in it.\r\nThe cliffs were water-worn, as if they had been gnawed for thousands\r\nof years by hungry waves. In some places they overhung their base so\r\nas to look like leaning towers that might topple over at any minute.\r\nIn other parts they were scooped into niches or caverns. Here and\r\nthere they were cracked in deep fissures, some of them of such width\r\nthat one might enter them, if he cared to run the risk of meeting the\r\nregular tenants, who might treat him as an intruder.\r\n\r\nParts of the ledge were cloven perpendicularly, with nothing but\r\ncracks or slightly projecting edges in which or on which a foot could\r\nfind hold. High up on one of these precipitous walls of rock he saw\r\nsome tufts of flowers, and knew them at once for the same that he had\r\nfound between the leaves of his Virgil. Not there, surely! No woman\r\nwould have clung against that steep, rough parapet to gather an idle\r\nblossom. And yet the master looked round everywhere, and even up the\r\nside of that rock, to see if there were no signs of a woman's\r\nfootstep. He peered about curiously, as if his eye might fall on some\r\nof those fragments of dress which women leave after them, whenever\r\nthey run against each other or against anything else,--in crowded\r\nballrooms, in the brushwood after picnics, on the fences after\r\nrambles, scattered round over every place that has witnessed an act\r\nof violence, where rude hands have been laid upon them. Nothing.\r\nStop, though, one moment. That stone is smooth and polished, as if it\r\nhad been somewhat worn by the pressure of human feet. There is one\r\ntwig broken among the stems of that clump of shrubs. He put his foot\r\nupon the stone and took hold of the close-clinging shrub. In this way\r\nhe turned a sharp angle of the rock and found himself on a natural\r\nplatform, which lay in front of one of the wider fissures,--whether\r\nthe mouth of a cavern or not he could not yet tell. A flat stone made\r\nan easy seat, upon which he sat down, as he was very glad to do, and\r\nlooked mechanically about him. A small fragment splintered from the\r\nrock was at his feet. He took it and threw it down the declivity a\r\nlittle below where he sat. He looked about for a stem or a straw of\r\nsome kind to bite upon,--a country-instinct,--relic, no doubt, of the\r\nold vegetable-feeding habits of Eden. Is that a stem or a straw? He\r\npicked it up. It was a hairpin.\r\n\r\nTo say that Mr. Langdon had a strange sort of thrill shoot through\r\nhim at the sight of this harmless little implement would be a\r\nstatement not at variance with the fact of the case. That smooth\r\nstone had been often trodden, and by what foot he could not doubt. He\r\nrose up from his seat to look round for other signs of a woman's\r\nvisits. What if there is a cavern here, where she has a retreat,\r\nfitted up, perhaps, as anchorites fitted their cells,--nay, it may\r\nbe, carpeted and mirrored, and with one of those tiger-skins for a\r\ncouch, such as they say the girl loves to lie on? Let us look, at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard walked to the mouth of the cavern or fissure and looked\r\ninto it. His look was met by the glitter of two diamond eyes, small,\r\nsharp, cold, shining out of the darkness, but gliding with a smooth,\r\nsteady motion towards the light, and himself. He stood fixed, struck\r\ndumb, staring back into them with dilating pupils and sudden numbness\r\nof fear that cannot move, as in the terror of dreams. The two sparks\r\nof light came forward until they grew to circles of flame, and all at\r\nonce lifted themselves up as if in angry surprise. Then for the first\r\ntime thrilled in Mr. Bernard's ears the dreadful sound that nothing\r\nwhich breathes, be it man or brute, can hear unmoved,--the long,\r\nloud, stinging whirr, as the huge, thick-bodied reptile shook his\r\nmany-jointed rattle and flung his jaw back for the fatal stroke. His\r\neyes were drawn as with magnets toward the circles of flame. His ears\r\nrung as in the overture to the swooning dream of chloroform. Nature\r\nwas before man with her anesthetics: the cat's first shake stupefies\r\nthe mouse; the lion's first shake deadens the man's fear and feeling;\r\nand the _crotalus_ paralyzes before he strikes. He waited as in a\r\ntrance,--waited as one that longs to have the blow fall, and all\r\nover, as the man who shall be in two pieces in a second waits for the\r\naxe to drop. But while he looked straight into the flaming eyes, it\r\nseemed to him that they were losing their light and terror, that they\r\nwere growing tame and dull; the open jaws closed, the neck fell\r\nbackward and downward on the coil from which it rose, the charm was\r\ndissolving, the numbness was passing away, he could move once more.\r\nHe heard a light breathing close to his ear, and, half turning, saw\r\nthe face of Elsie Venner, looking motionless into the reptile's eyes,\r\nwhich had shrunk and faded under the stronger enchantment of her own.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFAMILY SECRETS.\r\n\r\nIt was commonly understood in the town of Rockland that Dudley Venner\r\nhad had a great deal of trouble with that daughter of his, so\r\nhandsome, yet so peculiar, about whom there were so many strange\r\nstories. There was no end to the tales that were told of her\r\nextraordinary doings. Yet her name was never coupled with that of any\r\nyouth or man, until this cousin had provoked remark by his visit; and\r\neven then it was rather in the shape of wondering conjectures whether\r\nhe would dare to make love to her, than in any pretended knowledge of\r\ntheir relations to each other, that the public tongue exercised its\r\nvillage-prerogative of tattle.\r\n\r\nThe more common version of the trouble at the mansion-house was\r\nthis:--Elsie was not exactly in her right mind. Her temper was\r\nsingular, her tastes were anomalous, her habits were lawless, her\r\nantipathies were many and intense, and she was liable to explosions\r\nof ungovernable anger. Some said that was not the worst of it. At\r\nnearly fifteen years old, when she was growing fast, and in an\r\nirritable state of mind and body, she had had a governess placed over\r\nher for whom she had conceived an aversion. It was whispered among a\r\nfew who knew more of the family secrets than others, that, worried\r\nand exasperated by the presence and jealous oversight of this person,\r\nElsie had attempted to get finally rid of her by unlawful means, such\r\nas young girls have been known to employ in their straits, and to\r\nwhich the sex at all ages has a certain instinctive tendency, in\r\npreference to more palpable instruments for the righting of its\r\nwrongs. At any rate, this governess had been taken suddenly ill, and\r\nthe Doctor had been sent for at midnight. Old Sophy had taken her\r\nmaster into a room apart, and said a few words to him which turned\r\nhim as white as a sheet. As soon as he recovered himself, he sent\r\nSophy out, called in the old Doctor, and gave him some few hints, on\r\nwhich he acted at once, and had the satisfaction of seeing his\r\npatient out of danger before he left in the morning. It is proper to\r\nsay, that, during the following days, the most thorough search was\r\nmade in every nook and cranny of those parts of the house which Elsie\r\nchiefly haunted, but nothing was found which might be accused of\r\nhaving been the intentional cause of the probably accidental sudden\r\nillness of the governess. From this time forward her father was never\r\neasy. Should he keep her apart, or shut her up, for fear of risk to\r\nothers, and so lose every chance of restoring her mind to its healthy\r\ntone by kindly influences and intercourse with wholesome natures?\r\nThere was no proof, only presumption, as to the agency of Elsie in\r\nthe matter referred to. But the doubt was worse, perhaps, than\r\ncertainty would have been,--for then he would have known what to do.\r\n\r\nHe took the old Doctor as his adviser. The shrewd old man listened to\r\nthe father's story, his explanations of possibilities, of\r\nprobabilities, of dangers, of hopes. When he had got through, the\r\nDoctor looked him in the face steadily, as if he were saying, _Is\r\nthat all?_\r\n\r\nThe father's eyes fell. That was not all. There was something at the\r\nbottom of his soul which he could not bear to speak of,--nay, which,\r\nas often as it reared itself through the dark waves of unworded\r\nconsciousness into the breathing air of thought, he trod down as the\r\nruined angels tread down a lost soul trying to come up out of the\r\nseething sea of torture. Only this one daughter! No! God never would\r\nhave ordained such a thing. There was nothing ever heard of like it;\r\nit could not be; she was ill,--she would outgrow all these\r\nsingularities; he had had an aunt who was peculiar; he had heard that\r\nhysteric girls showed the strangest forms of moral obliquity for a\r\ntime, but came right at last. She would change all at once, when her\r\nhealth got more firmly settled in the course of her growth. Are there\r\nnot rough buds that open into sweet flowers? Are there not fruits,\r\nwhich, while unripe, are not to be tasted or endured, that mature\r\ninto the richest taste and fragrance? In God's good time she would\r\ncome to her true nature; her eyes would lose that frightful, cold\r\nglitter; her lips would not feel so cold when she pressed them\r\nmechanically against his cheek; and that faint birth-mark, her mother\r\nswooned when she first saw, would fade wholly out,--it was less\r\nmarked, surely, now than it used to be!\r\n\r\nSo Dudley Venner felt, and would have thought, if he had let his\r\nthoughts breathe the air of his soul. But the Doctor read through\r\nwords and thoughts and all into the father's consciousness. There are\r\nstates of mind that may be shared by two persons in presence of each\r\nother, which remain not only unworded, but _unthoughted_, if such a\r\nword may be coined for our special need. Such a mutually\r\ninterpenetrative consciousness there was between the father and the\r\nold physician. By a common impulse, both of them rose in a mechanical\r\nway and went to the western window, where each started, as he saw the\r\nother's look directed towards the white stone that stood in the midst\r\nof the small plot of green turf.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor had, for a moment, forgotten himself, but he looked up at\r\nthe clouds, which were angry, and said, as if speaking of the\r\nweather, \"It is dark now, but we hope it will clear up by-and-by.\r\nThere are a great many more clouds than rains, and more rains than\r\nstrokes of lightning, and more strokes of lightning than there are\r\npeople killed. We must let this girl of ours have her way, as far as\r\nit is safe. Send away this woman she hates, quietly. Get her a\r\nforeigner for a governess, if you can,--one that can dance and sing\r\nand will teach her. In the house old Sophy will watch her best. Out\r\nof it you must trust her, I am afraid,--for she will not be followed\r\nround, and she is in less danger than you think. If she wanders at\r\nnight, find her, if you can; the woods are not absolutely safe. If\r\nshe will be friendly with any young people, have them to see\r\nher,--young men, especially. She will not love any one easily, perhaps\r\nnot at all; yet love would be more like to bring her right than anything\r\nelse. If any young person seems in danger of falling in love with\r\nher, send him to me for counsel.\"\r\n\r\nDry, hard advice, but given from a kind heart, with a moist eye, and\r\nin tones that tried to be cheerful and were full of sympathy. This\r\nadvice was the key to the more than indulgent treatment which, as we\r\nhave seen, the girl had received from her father and all about her.\r\nThe old Doctor often came in, in the kindest, most natural sort of\r\nway, got into pleasant relations with Elsie by always treating her in\r\nthe same easy manner as at the great party, encouraging all her\r\nharmless fancies, and rarely reminding her that he was a professional\r\nadviser, except when she came out of her own accord, as in the talk\r\nthey had at the party, telling him of some wild trick she had been\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\n\"Let her go to the girls' school, by all means,\" said the Doctor,\r\nwhen she had begun to talk about it. \"Possibly she may take to some\r\nof the girls or of the teachers. Anything to interest her.\r\nFriendship, love, religion,--whatever will set her nature at work. We\r\nmust have headway on, or there will be no piloting her. Action first\r\nof all, and then we will see what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nSo, when Cousin Richard came along, the Doctor, though he did not\r\nlike his looks any too well, told her father to encourage his staying\r\nfor a time. If she liked him, it was good; if she only tolerated him,\r\nit was better than nothing.\r\n\r\n\"You know something about that nephew of yours, during these last\r\nyears, I suppose?\" the Doctor said. \"Looks as if he had seen life.\r\nHas a scar that was made by a sword-cut, and a white spot on the side\r\nof his neck that looks like a bulletmark. I think he has been what\r\nfolks call a 'hard customer.'\"\r\n\r\nDudley Venner owned that he had heard little or nothing of him of\r\nlate years. He had invited himself, and of course it would not be\r\ndecent not to receive him as a relative. He thought Elsie rather\r\nliked having him about the house for a while. She was very\r\ncapricious,--acted as if she fancied him one day and disliked him the\r\nnext. He did not know,--but (he said in a low voice) he had a\r\nsuspicion that this nephew of his was disposed to take a serious\r\nliking to Elsie. What should he do about it, if it turned out so?\r\n\r\nThe Doctor lifted his eyebrows a little. He thought there was no\r\nfear. Elsie was naturally what they call a man-hater, and there was\r\nvery little danger of any sudden passion springing up between two\r\nsuch young persons. Let him stay awhile; it gives her something to\r\nthink about.--So he stayed awhile, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nThe more Mr. Richard became acquainted with the family,--that is,\r\nwith the two persons of whom it consisted,--the more favorably the\r\nidea of a permanent residence in the mansion-house seemed to impress\r\nhim. The estate was large,--hundreds of acres, with woodlands and\r\nmeadows of great value. The father and daughter had been living\r\nquietly, and there could not be a doubt that the property which came\r\nthrough the Dudleys must have largely increased of late years. It was\r\nevident enough that they had an abundant income, from the way in\r\nwhich Elsie's caprices were indulged. She had horses and carriages to\r\nsuit herself; she sent to the great city for everything she wanted in\r\nthe way of dress. Even her diamonds--and the young man knew something\r\nabout these gems--must be of considerable value; and yet she wore\r\nthem carelessly, as it pleased her fancy. She had precious old laces,\r\ntoo, almost worth their weight in diamonds,--laces which had been\r\nsnatched from altars in ancient Spanish cathedrals during the wars,\r\nand which it would not be safe to leave a duchess alone with for ten\r\nminutes. The old house was fat with the deposits of rich generations\r\nwhich had gone before. The famous \"golden\" fireset was a purchase of\r\none of the family who had been in France during the Revolution, and\r\nmust have come from a princely palace, if not from one of the royal\r\nresidences. As for silver, the iron closet which had been made in the\r\ndining-room wall was running over with it: tea-kettles, coffee-pots,\r\nheavy-lidded tankards, chafing-dishes, punch-bowls, all that all the\r\nDudleys had ever used, from the caudle-cup that used to be handed\r\nround the young mother's chamber, and the porringer from which\r\nchildren scooped their bread-and-milk with spoons as solid as ingots,\r\nto that ominous vessel, on the upper shelf, far back in the dark,\r\nwith a spout like a slender italic S, out of which the sick and\r\ndying, all along the last century, and since, had taken the last\r\ndrops that passed their lips. Without being much of a scholar, Dick\r\ncould see well enough, too, that the books in the library had been\r\nordered from the great London houses, whose imprint they bore, by\r\npersons that knew what was best and meant to have it. A man does not\r\nrequire much learning to feel pretty sure, when he takes one of those\r\nsolid, smooth, velvet-leaved quartos, say a Baskerville Addison, for\r\ninstance, bound in red morocco, with a margin of gold, as rich as the\r\nembroidery of a prince's collar, as Vandyck drew it,--he need not\r\nknow much to feel pretty sure that a score or two of shelves full of\r\nsuch books mean that it took a long purse, as well as a literary\r\ntaste, to bring them together.\r\n\r\nTo all these attractions the mind of this thoughtful young gentleman\r\nmay be said to have been fully open. He did not disguise from\r\nhimself, however, that there were a number of drawbacks in the way of\r\nhis becoming established as the heir of the Dudley mansion-house and\r\nfortune. In the first place, Cousin Elsie was, unquestionably, very\r\npiquant, very handsome, game as a hawk, and hard to please, which\r\nmade her worth trying for. But then there was something about Cousin\r\nElsie,--(the small, white scars began stinging, as he said this to\r\nhimself, and he pushed his sleeve up to look at them,)--there was\r\nsomething about Cousin Elsie he couldn't make out. What was the\r\nmatter with her eyes, that they sucked your life out of you in that\r\nstrange way? What did she always wear a necklace for? Had she some\r\nsuch love-token on her neck as the old Don's revolver had left on\r\nhis? How safe would anybody feel to live with her? Besides, her\r\nfather would last forever, if he was left to himself. And he may take\r\nit into his head to marry again. That would be pleasant!\r\n\r\nSo talked Cousin Richard to himself, in the calm of the night and in\r\nthe tranquillity of his own soul. There was much to be said on both\r\nsides. It was a balance to be struck after the two columns were added\r\nup. He struck the balance, and came to the conclusion that he would\r\nfall in love with Elsie Venner.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent reader will not confound this matured and serious\r\nintention of falling in love with the young lady with that mere\r\nimpulse of the moment before mentioned as an instance of making love.\r\nOn the contrary, the moment Mr. Richard had made up his mind that he\r\nshould fall in love with Elsie, he began to be more reserved with\r\nher, and to try to make friends in other quarters. Sensible men, you\r\nknow, care very little what a girl's present fancy is. The question\r\nis: Who manages her, and how can you get at that person or those\r\npersons? Her foolish little sentiments are all very well in their\r\nway; but business is business, and we can't stop for such trifles.\r\nThe old political wire-pullers never go near the man they want to\r\ngain, if they can help it; they find out who his intimates and\r\nmanagers are, and work through them. Always handle any positively\r\nelectrical body, whether it is charged with passion, or power, with\r\nsome non-conductor between you and it, not with your naked\r\nhands.--The above were some of the young gentleman's working axioms;\r\nand he proceeded to act in accordance with them.\r\n\r\nHe began by paying his court more assiduously to his uncle. It was\r\nnot very hard to ingratiate himself in that quarter; for his manners\r\nwere insinuating, and his precocious experience of life made him\r\nentertaining. The old neglected billiard-room was soon put in order,\r\nand Dick, who was a magnificent player, had a series of games with\r\nhis uncle, in which, singularly enough, he was beaten, though his\r\nantagonist had been out of play for years. He evinced a profound\r\ninterest in the family history, insisted on having the details of its\r\nearly alliances, and professed a great pride of race, which he had\r\ninherited from his father, who, though he had allied himself with the\r\ndaughter of an alien race, had yet chosen one with the real azure\r\nblood in her veins, as proud as if she had Castile and Aragon for her\r\ndower and the Cid for her grandpapa. He also asked a great deal of\r\nadvice, such as inexperienced young persons are in need of, and\r\nlistened to it with great reverence.\r\n\r\nIt is not very strange that Uncle Dudley took a kinder view of his\r\nnephew than the Judge, who thought he could read a questionable\r\nhistory in his face,--or the old Doctor, who knew men's temperaments\r\nand organizations pretty well, and had his prejudices about races,\r\nand could tell an old sword-cut and a bullet-mark in two seconds from\r\na scar got by falling against the fender, or a mark left by king's\r\nevil. He could not be expected to share our own prejudices; for he\r\nhad heard nothing of the wild youth's adventures, or his scamper over\r\nthe Pampas at short notice. So, then, \"Richard Venner, Esquire, guest\r\nof Dudley Venner, Esquire, at his elegant mansion,\" prolonged his\r\nvisit until his presence became something like a matter of habit, and\r\nthe neighbors settled it beyond doubt that the fine old house would\r\nbe illuminated before long for a grand marriage.\r\n\r\nHe had done pretty well with the father: the next thing was to gain\r\nover the nurse. Old Sophy was as cunning as a red fox or a gray\r\nwoodchuck. She had nothing in the world to do but to watch Elsie; she\r\nhad nothing to care for but this girl and her father. She had never\r\nliked Dick too well; for he used to make faces at her and tease her\r\nwhen he was a boy, and now he was a man there was something about\r\nhim--she could not tell what--that made her suspicious of him. It was\r\nno small matter to get her over to his side.\r\n\r\nThe jet-black Africans know that gold never looks so well as on the\r\nfoil of their dark skins. Dick found in his trunk a string of gold\r\nbeads, such as are manufactured in some of our cities, which he had\r\nbrought from the gold region of Chili,--so he said,--for the express\r\npurpose of giving them to old Sophy. These Africans, too, have a\r\nperfect passion for gay-colored clothing; being condemned by Nature,\r\nas it were, to a perpetual mourning-suit, they love to enliven it\r\nwith all sorts of variegated stuffs of sprightly patterns, aflame\r\nwith red and yellow. The considerate young man had remembered this,\r\ntoo, and brought home for Sophy some handkerchiefs of rainbow hue,\r\nwhich had been strangely overlooked till now, at the bottom of one of\r\nhis trunks. Old Sophy took his gifts, but kept her black eyes open\r\nand watched every movement of the young people all the more closely.\r\nIt was through her that the father had always known most of the\r\nactions and tendencies of his daughter.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the strange adventure on The Mountain had brought\r\nthe young master into new relations with Elsie. She had saved him in\r\nthe extremity of peril by the exercise of some mysterious power. He\r\nwas grateful, and yet shuddered at the recollection of the whole\r\nscene. In his dreams he was pursued by the glare of cold glittering\r\neyes,--whether they were in the head of a woman or of a reptile he\r\ncould not always tell, the images had so run together. But he could\r\nnot help seeing that the eyes of the young girl had been often, very\r\noften, turned upon him when he had been looking away, and fell as his\r\nown glance met them. Helen Darley told him very plainly that this\r\ngirl was thinking about him more than about her book. Dick Venner\r\nfound she was getting more constant in her attendance at school. He\r\nlearned, on inquiry, that there was a new master, a handsome young\r\nman. The handsome young man would not have liked the look that came\r\nover Dick's face when he heard this fact mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn short, everything was getting tangled up together, and there would\r\nbe no chance of disentangling the threads in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF GALLERIES OF ART.\r\n\r\nIt is barely fifty years since England refused the gift of the\r\npictures that now constitute the Dulwich Gallery. So rapidly,\r\nhowever, did public opinion and taste become enlightened, that\r\ntwenty-five years afterwards Parliament voted seventy-three thousand\r\npounds for the purchase of thirty-eight pictures collected by Mr.\r\nAngerstein. This was the commencement of their National Gallery. In\r\n1790 but three national galleries existed in Europe,--those of\r\nDresden, Florence, and Amsterdam. The Louvre was then first\r\noriginated by a decree of the Constituent Assembly of France. England\r\nnow spends with open hand on schools of design, the accumulation of\r\ntreasures of art of every epoch and character, and whatever tends to\r\nelevate the taste and enlarge the means of the artistic education of\r\nher people,--perceiving, with far-sighted wisdom, that, through\r\nimproved manufacture and riper civilization, eventually a tenfold\r\nreturn will result to her treasury. The nations of Europe exult over\r\na new acquisition to their galleries, though its cost may have\r\nexceeded a hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWe are in that stage of indifference and neglect that one of our\r\nwealthiest cities recently refused to accept the donation of a\r\ngallery of some three hundred pictures, collected with taste and\r\ndiscrimination by a generous lover of art, because it did not wish to\r\nbe put to the expense of finding wall-room for them. But this spirit\r\nis departing, and now our slowness or reluctance is rather the result\r\nof a want of knowledge and critical judgment than of a want of\r\nfeeling for art.\r\n\r\nTo stimulate this feeling, it is requisite that our public should\r\nhave free access to galleries in which shall be exhibited in\r\nchronological series specimens of the art of all nations and schools,\r\narranged according to their motives and the special influences that\r\nattended their development. After this manner a mental and artistic\r\nhistory of the world may be spread out like a chart before the\r\nstudent, while the artist with equal facility can trace up to their\r\norigin the varied methods, styles, and excellences of each prominent\r\nepoch. A gallery of art is a perpetual feast of the most intense and\r\nrefined enjoyment to every one capable of entering into its phases of\r\nthought and execution, analyzing its external and internal being, and\r\ntracing the mysterious transformations of spirit into form. It has\r\nbeen well said, that a complete gallery, on a broad foundation, in\r\nwhich all tastes, styles, and methods harmoniously mingle, is a court\r\nof final appeal of one phase of civilization against another, from an\r\nexamination of which we can sum up their respective qualities and\r\nmerits, drawing therefrom for our own edification as from a perpetual\r\nwellspring of inspiration and knowledge. But if we sit in judgment\r\nupon the great departed, they likewise sit in judgment upon us. And\r\nit is precisely where such means of testing artistic growth best\r\nexist that modern art is at once most humble and most aspiring:\r\nconscious of its own power and in many respects superior technical\r\nadvantages, both it and the public are still content to go to the\r\npast for instruction, and each to seek to rise above the transitory\r\nbias of fashion or local passions to a standard of taste that will\r\nabide world-wide comparison and criticism.\r\n\r\nAn edifice for a gallery or museum of art should be fire-proof,\r\nsufficiently isolated for light and effective ornamentation, and\r\nconstructed so as to admit of indefinite extension. Its chief feature\r\nshould be the suitable accommodation and exhibition of its contents.\r\nBut provision should be made for its becoming eventually in\r\narchitectural effect consistent with its object. The skeleton of such\r\na building need not be costly. Its chief expense would be in its\r\nultimate adornment with marble facings, richly colored stones,\r\nsculpture or frescoes, according to a design which should enforce\r\nstrict purity of taste and conformity to its motive. This gradual\r\ncompletion, as happened to the mediæval monuments of Europe, could be\r\nextended through many generations, which would thus be linked with\r\none another in a common object of artistic and patriotic pride\r\ngradually growing up among them, as a national monument, with its\r\nfoundations deeply laid in a unity of feeling and those desirable\r\nassociations of love and veneration which in older civilizations so\r\ndelightfully harmonize the past with the present. Each epoch of\r\nartists would be instructed by the skill of its predecessor, and\r\nstimulated to connect its name permanently with so glorious a shrine.\r\nWealth, as in the days of democratic Greece and Italy, would be\r\nlavished upon the completion of a temple of art destined to endure as\r\nlong as material can defy time, a monument of the people's taste and\r\nmunificence. There would be born among them the spirit of those\r\nAthenians who said to Phidias, when he asked if he should use ivory\r\nor marble for the statue of their protecting goddess, \"Use that\r\nmaterial which is most _worthy_ of our city.\"\r\n\r\nUntil recently, no attention has been paid, even in Europe, to\r\nhistorical sequence and special motives in the arrangement of\r\ngalleries. As in the Pitti Gallery, pictures were generally hung so\r\nas to conform to the symmetry of the rooms,--various styles, schools,\r\nand epochs being intermixed. As the progress of ideas is of more\r\nimportance to note than the variations of styles or the degree of\r\ntechnical merit, the chief attention in selection and position should\r\nbe given to lucidly exhibiting the varied phases of artistic thought\r\namong the diverse races and widely separated eras and inspirations\r\nwhich gave them being. The mechanism of art is, however, go\r\nintimately interwoven with the idea, that by giving precedence to the\r\nlatter we most readily arrive at the best arrangement of the former.\r\nEach cycle of civilization should have its special department,\r\nPaganism and Christianity being kept apart, and not, as in the\r\nFlorentine Gallery, intermixed,--presenting a strange jumble of\r\nclassical statuary and modern paintings in anachronistic disorder, to\r\nthe loss of the finest properties of each to the eye, and the\r\ndestruction of that unity of motive and harmonious association so\r\nessential to the proper exhibition of art. For it is essential that\r\nevery variety of artistic development should be associated solely\r\nwith those objects or conditions most in keeping with its\r\ninspirations. In this way we quickest come to an understanding of its\r\noriginating idea, and sympathize with its feeling, tracing its\r\nprogress from infancy to maturity and decay, and comparing it as a\r\nwhole with corresponding or rival varieties of artistic development.\r\nThis systematized variety of one great unity is of the highest\r\nimportance in placing the spectator in affinity with art as a whole\r\nand with its diversities of character, and in giving him sound\r\nstand-points of comparison and criticism. In this way, as in the Louvre,\r\nfeeling and thought are readily transported from one epoch of\r\ncivilization to another, grasping the motives and execution of each\r\nwith pleasurable accuracy. We perceive that no conventional standard\r\nof criticism, founded upon the opinions or fashions of one age, is\r\napplicable to all. To rightly comprehend each, we must broadly survey\r\nthe entire ground of art, and make ourselves for the time members, as\r\nit were, of the political and social conditions of life that give\r\norigin to the objects of our investigations. This philosophical mode\r\nof viewing art does not exclude an æsthetic point of view, but rather\r\nheightens that and makes it more intelligible. Paganism would be\r\nsubdivided into the various national forms that illustrated its rise\r\nand fall. Egypt, India, China, Assyria, Greece, Etruria, and Rome,\r\nwould stand each by itself as a component part of a great whole: so\r\nwith Christianity, in such shapes as have already taken foothold in\r\nhistory, the Latin, Byzantine, Lombard, Mediæval, Renaissant, and\r\nProtestant art, subdivided into its diversified schools or leading\r\nideas, all graphically arranged so as to demonstrate, amid the\r\ninfinite varieties of humanity, a divine unity of origin and design,\r\nlinking together mankind in one common family.\r\n\r\nBeside statuary and paintings, an institution of this nature should\r\ncontain specimens of every kind of industry in which art is the\r\nprimary inspiration, to illustrate the qualities and degrees of\r\nsocial refinement in nations and eras. This would include every\r\nvariety of ornamental art in which invention and skill are\r\nconspicuous, as well as those works more directly inspired by higher\r\nmotives and intended as a joy forever. Architecture and objects not\r\ntransportable could be represented by casts or photographs. Models,\r\ndrawings, and engravings also come within its scope; and there should\r\nbe attached to the parent gallery a library of reference and a\r\nlecture- and reading-room.\r\n\r\nConnected with it there might be schools of design for improvement in\r\nornamental manufacture, the development of architecture, and whatever\r\naids to refine and give beauty to social life, including a simple\r\nacademic system for the elementary branches of drawing and coloring,\r\nupon a scientific basis of accumulated knowledge and experience,\r\nproviding models and other advantages not readily accessible to\r\nprivate resources, but leaving individual genius free to follow its\r\nown promptings upon a well-laid technical foundation. As soon as the\r\nyoung artist has acquired the grammar of his profession, he should be\r\nsent forth to study directly from Nature and to mature his invention\r\nunfettered by authoritative academic system, which more frequently\r\nfosters conventionalism and imposes trammels upon talent than endows\r\nit with strength and freedom.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief sketch of institutions feasible amongst us from\r\nhumble beginnings by individual enterprise. Once founded and their\r\nvalue demonstrated, the countenance of the state may be hopefully\r\ninvoked. Their very existence would become an incentive to munificent\r\ngifts. Individuals owning fine works of art would grow ambitious to\r\nhave their memories associated with patriotic enterprise. Art invokes\r\nliberality and evokes fraternity. The sentiment, that there is a\r\ncommon property in the productions of genius, making possession a\r\ntrust for the public welfare, will increase among those by whose\r\ntaste and wealth they have been accumulated. Masterpieces will cease\r\nto be regarded as the selfish acquisitions of covetous amateurs, but,\r\nlike spoken truth, will become the inalienable birthright of the\r\npeople,--finding their way freely and generously, through the\r\nmagnetic influences of public spirit and pertinent examples, to those\r\ndepositories where they can most efficaciously perform their mission\r\nof truth and beauty to the world. Then the people themselves will\r\nbegin to take pride in their artistic wealth, to honor artists as\r\nthey now do soldiers and statesmen, and to value the more highly\r\nthose virtues which are interwoven with all noble effort.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, when the National Gallery of England was founded, the\r\nEnglish were nearly as dead to art as we are now. A few amateurs\r\nalone cultivated it, but there was no general sympathy with nor\r\nknowledge of it. Yet by 1837, in donations alone, the gallery had\r\nreceived one hundred and thirty-seven pictures. Since that period\r\ngifts have increased tenfold in value and numbers. Connected with it,\r\nand a part of that noble, comprehensive, and munificent system of\r\nart-education which the British government has inculcated, are the\r\nBritish and Kensington Museums. Schools of design, with every\r\nappliance for the growth of art, have rapidly sprung into existence.\r\nPrivate enterprise and research have correspondingly increased.\r\nBritish agents, with unstinted means, are everywhere ransacking the\r\nearth in quest of everything that can add to the value and utility of\r\ntheir national and private collections. A keen regard for all that\r\nconcerns art, a desire for its national development, an enlightened\r\nstandard of criticism, and with it the most eloquent art-literature\r\nof any tongue, have all recently sprung into existence in our\r\nmotherland. All honor to those generous spirits that have produced\r\nthis,--and honor to the nation that so wisely expends its wealth! A\r\nnoble example for America! England also throws open to the\r\ncompetition of the world plans for her public buildings and\r\nmonuments. Mistakes and defects there have been, but an honest desire\r\nfor amendment and to promote the intellectual growth of the nation\r\nnow characterizes her pioneers in this cause. And what progress!\r\nBetween 1823 and 1850, in the Museum alone, there have been expended\r\n$10,000,000. Within twelve years, $450,000 have been expended on the\r\nNational Gallery for pictures, and yet its largest accession of\r\ntreasures is by gifts and bequests. Lately, beside the Pisani\r\nVeronese bought for $70,000, eight other paintings have been\r\npurchased at a cost of $50,000. In 1858, $36,000 were given for the\r\nchoice of twenty, of the early Italian schools, from the Lombardi\r\nGallery at Florence,--not masterpieces, but simply characteristic\r\nspecimens, more or less restored. The average cost of late\r\nacquisitions has been about $6,000 each. In 1858, there were 823,000\r\nvisitors to both branches of the National Gallery. Who can estimate\r\nnot alone the pleasure and instruction afforded by such an\r\ninstitution to its million of annual visitors, but the ideas and\r\ninspiration thence born, destined to grow and fructify to the glory\r\nand good of the nation? At present there are seventy-seven schools of\r\nart in England, attended by 68,000 students. In 1859, they and\r\nkindred institutions received a public grant of nearly $450,000. The\r\nappropriation for the British Museum alone, for 1860, is £77,452.\r\n\r\nTo the Louvre Louis XVIII. added one hundred and eleven pictures, at\r\na cost of about $132,000; Charles X., twenty-four, at $12,000; Louis\r\nPhilippe, fifty-three, at $14,500; and Napoleon III., thus far,\r\nthirty paintings, costing $200,000, one of which, the Murillo, cost\r\n$125,000. Russia is following in the same path. Italy, Greece, and\r\nEgypt, by stringent regulations, are making it yearly more difficult\r\nfor any precious work to leave their shores. If, therefore, America\r\nis ever to follow in the same path, she must soon bestir herself, or\r\nshe will have nothing but barren fields to glean from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDARWIN ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovelties are enticing to most people: to us they are simply\r\nannoying. We cling to a long-accepted theory, just as we cling to an\r\nold suit of clothes. A new theory, like a new pair of breeches, (\"The\r\nAtlantic\" still affects the older type of nether garment,) is sure to\r\nhave hard-fitting places; or even when no particular fault can be\r\nfound with the article, it oppresses with a sense of general\r\ndiscomfort. New notions and new styles worry us, till we get well\r\nused to them, which is only by slow degrees.\r\n\r\nWherefore, in Galileo's time, we might have helped to proscribe, or\r\nto burn--had he been stubborn enough to warrant cremation--even the\r\ngreat pioneer of inductive research; although, when we had fairly\r\nrecovered our composure, and had leisurely excogitated the matter, we\r\nmight have come to conclude that the new doctrine was better than the\r\nold one, after all, at least for those who had nothing to unlearn.\r\n\r\nSuch being our habitual state of mind, it may well be believed that\r\nthe perusal of the new book \"On the Origin of Species by Means of\r\nNatural Selection\" left an uncomfortable impression, in spite of its\r\nplausible and winning ways. We were not wholly unprepared for it, as\r\nmany of our contemporaries seem to have been. The scientific reading\r\nin which we indulge as a relaxation from severer studies had raised\r\ndim forebodings. Investigations about the succession of species in\r\ntime, and their actual geographical distribution over the earth's\r\nsurface, were leading up from all sides and in various ways to the\r\nquestion of their origin. Now and then we encountered a sentence,\r\nlike Professor Owen's \"axiom of the continuous operation of the\r\nordained becoming of living things,\" which haunted us like an\r\napparition. For, dim as our conception must needs be as to what such\r\noracular and grandiloquent phrases might really mean, we felt\r\nconfident that they presaged no good to old beliefs. Foreseeing, yet\r\ndeprecating, the coming time of trouble, we still hoped, that, with\r\nsome repairs and make-shifts, the old views might last out our days.\r\n_Après nous le déluge_. Still, not to lag behind the rest of the\r\nworld, we read the book in which the new theory is promulgated. We\r\ntook it up, like our neighbors, and, as was natural, in a somewhat\r\ncaptious frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWell, we found no cause of quarrel with the first chapter. Here the\r\nauthor takes us directly to the barn-yard and the kitchen-garden.\r\nLike an honorable rural member of our General Court, who sat silent\r\nuntil, near the close of a long session, a bill requiring all swine\r\nat large to wear pokes was introduced, when he claimed the privilege\r\nof addressing the house, on the proper ground that he had been\r\n\"brought up among the pigs, and knew all about them,\"--so we were\r\nbrought up among cows and cabbages; and the lowing of cattle, the\r\ncackling of hens, and the cooing of pigeons were sounds native and\r\npleasant to our ears. So \"Variation under Domestication\" dealt with\r\nfamiliar subjects in a natural way, and gently introduced \"Variation\r\nunder Nature,\" which seemed likely enough. Then follows \"Struggle for\r\nExistence,\"--a principle which we experimentally know to be true and\r\ncogent,--bringing the comfortable assurance, that man, even upon\r\nLeviathan Hobbes's theory of society, is no worse than the rest of\r\ncreation, since all Nature is at war, one species with another, and\r\nthe nearer kindred the more internecine,--bringing in thousand-fold\r\nconfirmation and extension of the Malthusian doctrine, that\r\npopulation tends far to outrun means of subsistence throughout the\r\nanimal and vegetable world, and has to be kept down by sharp\r\npreventive checks; so that not more than one of a hundred or a\r\nthousand of the individuals whose existence is so wonderfully and so\r\nsedulously provided for ever comes to anything, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances; so the lucky and the strong must prevail, and the\r\nweaker and ill-favored must perish;--and then follows, as naturally\r\nas one sheep follows another, the chapter on \"Natural Selection,\"\r\nDarwin's _cheval de bataille_, which is very much the Napoleonic\r\ndoctrine, that Providence favors the strongest battalions,--that,\r\nsince many more individuals are born than can possibly survive, those\r\nindividuals and those variations which possess any advantage, however\r\nslight, over the rest, are in the long run sure to survive, to\r\npropagate, and to occupy the limited field, to the exclusion or\r\ndestruction of the weaker brethren. All this we pondered, and could\r\nnot much object to. In fact, we began to contract a liking for a\r\nsystem which at the outset illustrates the advantages of good\r\nbreeding, and which makes the most \"of every creature's best.\"\r\n\r\nCould we \"let by-gones be by-gones,\" and, beginning now, go\r\non improving and diversifying for the future by natural\r\nselection,--could we even take up the theory at the introduction of the\r\nactually existing species, we should be well content, and so perhaps would\r\nmost naturalists be. It is by no means difficult to believe that\r\nvarieties are incipient or possible species, when we see what trouble\r\nnaturalists, especially botanists, have to distinguish between\r\nthem,--one regarding as a true species what another regards as a\r\nvariety; when the progress of knowledge increases, rather than\r\ndiminishes, the number of doubtful instances; and when there is less\r\nagreement than ever among naturalists as to what the basis is in\r\nNature upon which our idea of species reposes, or how the word is\r\npractically to be defined. Indeed, when we consider the endless\r\ndisputes of naturalists and ethnologists over the human races, as to\r\nwhether they belong to one species or to more, and if to more,\r\nwhether to three, or five, or fifty, we can hardly help fancying that\r\nboth may be right,--or rather, that the uni-humanitarians would have\r\nbeen right several thousand years ago, and the multi-humanitarians\r\nwill be a few thousand years later; while at present the safe thing\r\nto say is, that, probably, there is some truth on both sides.\r\n\"Natural selection,\" Darwin remarks, \"leads to divergence of\r\ncharacter; for more living brings can be supported on the same area\r\nthe more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution,\" (a\r\nprinciple which, by the way, is paralleled and illustrated by the\r\ndiversification of human labor,) and also leads to much extinction of\r\nintermediate or unimproved forms. Now, though this divergence may\r\n\"steadily tend to increase,\" yet this is evidently a slow process in\r\nNature, and liable to much counteraction wherever man does not\r\ninterpose, and so not likely to work much harm for the future. And if\r\nnatural selection, with artificial to help it, will produce better\r\nanimals and better men than the present, and fit them better to \"the\r\nconditions of existence,\" why, let it work, say we, to the top of its\r\nbent. There is still room enough for improvement. Only let us hope\r\nthat it always works for good: if not, the divergent lines on\r\nDarwin's diagram of transmutation made easy ominously show what small\r\ndeviations from the straight path may come to in the end.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of the future, accordingly, is on the whole pleasant and\r\nencouraging. It is only the backward glance, the gaze up the long\r\nvista of the past, that reveals anything alarming. Here the lines\r\nconverge as they recede into the geological ages, and point to\r\nconclusions which, upon the theory, are inevitable, but by no means\r\nwelcome. The very first step backwards makes the Negro and the\r\nHottentot our blood-relations;--not that reason or Scripture objects\r\nto that, though pride may. The next suggests a closer association of\r\nour ancestors of the olden time with \"our poor relations\" of the\r\nquadrumanous family than we like to acknowledge. Fortunately,\r\nhowever,--even if we must account for him scientifically,--man with\r\nhis two feet stands upon a foundation of his own. Intermediate links\r\nbetween the _Bimana_ and the _Quadrumana_ are lacking altogether; so\r\nthat, put the genealogy of the brutes upon what footing you will, the\r\nfour-handed races will not serve for our forerunners;--at least, not\r\nuntil some monkey, live or fossil, is producible with great toes,\r\ninstead of thumbs, upon his nether extremities; or until some lucky\r\ngeologist turns up the bones of his ancestor and prototype in France\r\nor England, who was so busy \"napping the chuckie-stanes\" and chipping\r\nout flint knives and arrow-heads in the time of the drift, very many\r\nages ago,--before the British Channel existed, says Lyell[1],--and\r\nuntil these men of the olden time are shown to have worn their\r\ngreat-toes in a divergent and thumb-like fashion. That would be evidence\r\nindeed: but until some testimony of the sort is produced, we must\r\nneeds believe in the separate and special creation of man, however it\r\nmay have been with the lower animals and with plants.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the full development and symmetry of Darwin's hypothesis\r\nstrongly suggest the evolution of the human no less than the lower\r\nanimal races out of some simple primordial animal,--that all are\r\nequally \"lineal descendants of sense few beings which lived long\r\nbefore the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited.\" But, as\r\nthe author speaks disrespectfully of spontaneous generation, and\r\naccepts a supernatural beginning of life on earth, in some form or\r\nforms of being which included potentially all that have since existed\r\nand are yet to be, he is thereby not warranted to extend his\r\ninferences beyond the evidence or the fair probability. There seems\r\nas great likelihood that one special origination should be followed\r\nby another upon fitting occasion, (such as the introduction of man,)\r\nas that one form should be transmuted into another upon fitting\r\noccasion, as, for instance, in the succession of species which differ\r\nfrom each other only in some details. To compare small things with\r\ngreat in a homely illustration: man alters from time to time his\r\ninstruments or machines, as new circumstances or conditions may\r\nrequire and his wit suggest. Minor alterations and improvements he\r\nadds to the machine he possesses: he adapts a new rig or a new rudder\r\nto an old boat: this answers to _variation_. If boats could engender,\r\nthe variations would doubtless be propagated, like those of domestic\r\ncattle. In course of time the old ones would be worn out or wrecked;\r\nthe best sorts would be chosen for each particular use, and further\r\nimproved upon, and so the primordial boat be developed into the scow,\r\nthe skiff, the sloop, and other species of water-craft,--the very\r\ndiversification, as well as the successive improvements, entailing\r\nthe disappearance of many intermediate forms, less adapted to any one\r\nparticular purpose; wherefore these go slowly out of use, and become\r\nextinct species: this is _natural selection_. Now let a great and\r\nimportant advance be made, like that of steam-navigation: here,\r\nthough the engine might be added to the old vessel, yet the wiser and\r\ntherefore the actual way is to make a new vessel on a modified plan:\r\nthis may answer to _specific creation_. Anyhow, the one does not\r\nnecessarily exclude the other. Variation and natural selection may\r\nplay their part, and so may specific creation also. Why not?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vide _Proceedings of the British Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science_, 1859, and London _Athenæum_, passim. It\r\nappears to be conceded that these \"celts\" or stone knives are\r\nartificial productions, and of the age of the mammoth, the fossil\r\nrhinoceros, etc.]\r\n\r\nThis leads us to ask for the reasons which call for this new theory\r\nof transmutation. The beginning of things must needs lie in\r\nobscurity, beyond the bounds of proof, though within those of\r\nconjecture or of analogical inference. Why not hold fast to the\r\ncustomary view, that all species were directly, instead of\r\nindirectly, created after their respective kinds, as we now behold\r\nthem,--and that in a manner which, passing our comprehension, we\r\nintuitively refer to the supernatural? Why this continual striving\r\nafter \"the unattained and dim,\"--these anxious endeavors, especially\r\nof late years, by naturalists and philosophers of various schools and\r\ndifferent tendencies, to penetrate what one of them calls \"the\r\nmystery of mysteries,\" the origin of species? To this, in general,\r\nsufficient answer may be found in the activity of the human\r\nintellect, \"the delirious yet divine desire to know,\" stimulated as\r\nit has been by its own success in unveiling the laws and processes of\r\ninorganic Nature,--in the fact that the principal triumphs of our age\r\nin physical science have consisted in tracing connections where none\r\nwere known before, in reducing heterogeneous phenomena to a common\r\ncause or origin, in a manner quite analogous to that of the reduction\r\nof supposed independently originated species to a common ultimate\r\norigin,--thus, and in various other ways, largely and legitimately\r\nextending the domain of secondary causes. Surely the scientific mind\r\nof an age which contemplates the solar system as evolved from a\r\ncommon, revolving, fluid mass,--which, through experimental research,\r\nhas come to regard light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemical\r\naffinity, and mechanical power as varieties or derivative\r\nand convertible forms of one force, instead of independent\r\nspecies,--which has brought the so-called elementary kinds of matter, such\r\nas the metals, into kindred groups, and raised the question, whether the\r\nmembers of each group may not be mere varieties of one species,--and\r\nwhich speculates steadily in the direction of the ultimate unity of\r\nmatter, of a sort of prototype or simple element which may be to the\r\nordinary species of matter what the _protozoa_ or component cells of\r\nan organism are to the higher sorts of animals and plants,--the mind\r\nof such an age cannot be expected to let the old belief about species\r\npass unquestioned.\r\n\r\nIt will raise the question, how the diverse sorts of plants and\r\nanimals came to be as they are and where they are, and will allow\r\nthat the whole inquiry transcends its powers only when all endeavors\r\nhave failed. Granting the origin to be supernatural, or miraculous\r\neven, will not arrest the inquiry. All real origination, the\r\nphilosophers will say, is supernatural; their very question is,\r\nwhether we have yet gone back to the origin, and can affirm that the\r\npresent forms of plants and animals are the primordial, the\r\nmiraculously created ones. And even if they admit that, they will\r\nstill inquire into the order of the phenomena, into the form of the\r\nmiracle. You might as well expect the child to grow up content with\r\nwhat it is told about the advent of its infant brother. Indeed, to\r\nlearn that the new-comer is the gift of God, far from lulling\r\ninquiry, only stimulates speculation as to how the precious gift was\r\nbestowed. That questioning child is father to the man,--is\r\nphilosopher in short-clothes.\r\n\r\nSince, then, questions about the origin of species will be raised,\r\nand have been raised,--and since the theorizings, however different\r\nin particulars, all proceed upon the notion that one species of plant\r\nor animal is somehow derived from another, that the different sorts\r\nwhich now flourish are lineal (or unlineal) descendants of other and\r\nearlier sorts,--it now concerns us to ask, What are the grounds in\r\nNature, the admitted facts, which suggest hypotheses of derivation,\r\nin some shape or other? Reasons there must be, and plausible ones,\r\nfor the persistent recurrence of theories upon this genetic basis. A\r\nstudy of Darwin's book, and a general glance at the present state of\r\nthe natural sciences, enable us to gather the following as perhaps\r\nthe most suggestive and influential. We can only enumerate them here,\r\nwithout much indication of their particular bearing. There is,--\r\n\r\n1. The general fact of variability;--the patent fact, that all\r\nspecies vary more or less; that domesticated plants and animals,\r\nbeing in conditions favorable to the production and preservation of\r\nvarieties, are apt to vary widely; and that by interbreeding, any\r\nvariety may be fixed into a race, that is, into a variety which comes\r\ntrue from seed. Many such races, it is allowed, differ from each\r\nother in structure and appearance as widely as do many admitted\r\nspecies; and it is practically very difficult, perhaps impossible, to\r\ndraw a clear line between races and species. Witness the human races,\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\nWild species also vary, perhaps about as widely as those of\r\ndomestication, though in different ways. Some of them appear to vary\r\nlittle, others moderately, others immoderately, to the great\r\nbewilderment of systematic botanists and zoologists, and their\r\nincreasing disagreement as to whether various forms shall be held to\r\nbe original species or marked varieties. Moreover, the degree to\r\nwhich the descendants of the same stock, varying in different\r\ndirections, may at length diverge is unknown. All we know is, that\r\nvarieties are themselves variable, and that very diverse forms have\r\nbeen educed from one stock.\r\n\r\n2. Species of the same genus are not distinguished from each other by\r\nequal amounts of difference. There is diversity in this respect\r\nanalogous to that of the varieties of a polymorphous species, some of\r\nthem slight, others extreme. And in large genera the unequal\r\nresemblance shows itself in the clustering of the species around\r\nseveral types or central species, like satellites around their\r\nrespective planets. Obviously suggestive this of the hypothesis that\r\nthey were satellites, not thrown off by revolution, like the moons of\r\nJupiter, Saturn, and our own solitary moon, but gradually and\r\npeacefully detached by divergent variation. That such closely related\r\nspecies may be only varieties of higher grade, earlier origin, or\r\nmore favored evolution, is not a very violent supposition. Anyhow, it\r\nwas a supposition sure to be made.\r\n\r\n3. The actual geographical distribution of species upon the earth's\r\nsurface tends to suggest the same notion. For, as a general thing,\r\nall or most of the species of a peculiar genus or other type are\r\ngrouped in the same country, or occupy continuous, proximate, or\r\naccessible areas. So well does this rule hold, so general is the\r\nimplication that kindred species are or were associated\r\ngeographically, that most trustworthy naturalists, quite free from\r\nhypotheses of transmutation, are constantly inferring former\r\ngeographical continuity between parts of the world now widely\r\ndisjoined, in order to account thereby for the generic similarities\r\namong their inhabitants. Yet no scientific explanation has been\r\noffered to account for the geographical association of kindred\r\nspecies, except the hypothesis of a common origin.\r\n\r\n4. Here the fact of the antiquity of creation, and in particular of\r\nthe present kinds of the earth's inhabitants, or of a large part of\r\nthem, comes in to rebut the objection, that there has not been time\r\nenough for any marked diversification of living things through\r\ndivergent variation,--not time enough for varieties to have diverged\r\ninto what we call species.\r\n\r\nSo long as the existing species of plants and animals were thought to\r\nhave originated a few thousand years ago and without predecessors,\r\nthere was no room for a theory of derivation of one sort from\r\nanother, nor time enough even to account for the establishment of the\r\nraces which are generally believed to have diverged from a common\r\nstock. Not that five or six thousand years was a short allowance for\r\nthis; but because some of our familiar domesticated varieties of\r\ngrain, of fowls, and of other animals, were pictured and mummified by\r\nthe old Egyptians more than half that number of years ago, if not\r\nmuch earlier. Indeed, perhaps the strongest argument for the original\r\nplurality of human species was drawn from the identification of some\r\nof the present races of men upon these early historical monuments and\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nBut this very extension of the current chronology, if we may rely\r\nupon the archæologists, removes the difficulty by opening up a longer\r\nvista. So does the discovery in Europe of remains and implements of\r\npre-historic races of men to whom the use of metals was unknown,--men\r\nof the _stone age_, as the Scandinavian archæologists designate them.\r\nAnd now, \"axes and knives of flint, evidently wrought by human skill,\r\nare found in beds of the drift at Amiens, (also in other places, both\r\nin France and England,) associated with the bones of extinct species\r\nof animals.\" These implements, indeed, were noticed twenty years ago;\r\nat a place in Suffolk they have been exhumed from time to time for\r\nmore than a century; but the full confirmation, the recognition of\r\nthe age of the deposit in which the implements occur, their\r\nabundance, and the appreciation of their bearings upon most\r\ninteresting questions, belong to the present time. To complete the\r\nconnection of these primitive people with the fossil ages, the French\r\ngeologists, we are told, have now \"found these axes in Picardy\r\nassociated with remains of _Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros\r\ntichorhinus, Equus fossilis_, and an extinct species of _Bos_.\"[1] In\r\nplain language, these workers in flint lived in the time of the\r\nmammoth, of a rhinoceros now extinct, and along with horses and\r\ncattle unlike any now existing,--specifically different, as\r\nnaturalists say, from those with which man is now associated. Their\r\nconnection with existing human races may perhaps be traced through\r\nthe intervening people of the stone age, who were succeeded by the\r\npeople of the bronze age, and these by workers in iron.[2] Now,\r\nvarious evidence carries back the existence of many of the present\r\nlower species of animals, and probably of a larger number of plants,\r\nto the same drift period. All agree that this was very many thousand\r\nyears ago. Agassiz tells us that the same species of polyps which are\r\nnow building coral walls around the present peninsula of Florida\r\nactually made that peninsula, and have been building there for\r\ncenturies which must be reckoned by thousands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Correspondence of M. Nicklès, in _American Journal\r\nof Science and Arts_, for March, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Morlet, _Some General Views on Archæology_, in\r\n_American Journal of Science and Arts_, for January, 1860, translated\r\nfrom _Bulletin de la Société Vaudoise_, 1859.]\r\n\r\n5. The overlapping of existing and extinct species, and the seemingly\r\ngradual transition of the life of the drift period into that of the\r\npresent, may be turned to the same account. Mammoths, mastodons, and\r\nIrish elks, now extinct, must have lived down to human, if not almost\r\nto historic times. Perhaps the last dodo did not long outlive his\r\nhuge New Zealand kindred. The auroch, once the companion of mammoths,\r\nstill survives, but apparently owes his present and precarious\r\nexistence to man's care. Now, nothing that we know of forbids the\r\nhypothesis that some new species have been independently and\r\nsupernaturally created within the period which other species have\r\nsurvived. It may even be believed that man was created in the days of\r\nthe mammoth, became extinct, and was recreated at a later date. But\r\nwhy not say the same of the auroch, contemporary both of the old man\r\nand of the new? Still it is more natural, if not inevitable, to\r\ninfer, that, if the aurochs of that olden time were the ancestors of\r\nthe aurochs of the Lithuanian forests, so likewise were the men of\r\nthat age--if men they were--the ancestors of the present human races.\r\nThen, whoever concludes that these primitive makers of rude flint\r\naxes and knives were the ancestors of the better workmen of the\r\nsucceeding stone age, and these again of the succeeding artificers in\r\nbrass and iron, will also be likely to suppose that the _Equus_ and\r\n_Bos_ of that time were the remote progenitors of our own horses and\r\ncattle. In all candor we must at least concede that such\r\nconsiderations suggest a genetic descent from the drift period down\r\nto the present, and allow time enough--if time is of any account--for\r\nvariation and natural selection to work out some appreciable results\r\nin the way of divergence into races or even into so-called species.\r\nWhatever might have been thought, when geological time was supposed\r\nto be separated from the present era by a clear line, it is certain\r\nthat a gradual replacement of old forms by new ones is strongly\r\nsuggestive of some mode of origination which may still be operative.\r\nWhen species, like individuals, were found to die out one by one, and\r\napparently to come in one by one, a theory for what Owen sonorously\r\ncalls \"the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living\r\nthings\" could not be far off.\r\n\r\nThat all such theories should take the form of a derivation of the\r\nnew from the old seems to be inevitable, perhaps from our inability\r\nto conceive of any other line of secondary causes, in this\r\nconnection. Owen himself is apparently in travail with some\r\ntransmutation theory of his own conceiving, which may yet see the\r\nlight, although Darwin's came first to the birth. Different as the\r\ntwo theories will probably be in particulars, they cannot fail to\r\nexhibit that fundamental resemblance in this respect which betokens a\r\ncommunity of origin, a common foundation on the general facts and the\r\nobvious suggestions of modern science. Indeed,--to turn the point of\r\na taking simile directed against Darwin,--the difference between the\r\nDarwinian and the Owenian hypotheses may, after all, be only that\r\nbetween homoeopathic and heroic doses of the same drug.\r\n\r\nIf theories of derivation could only stop here, content with\r\nexplaining the diversification and succession of species between the\r\ntertiary period and the present time, through natural agencies or\r\nsecondary causes still in operation, we fancy they would not be\r\ngenerally or violently objected to by the _savans_ of the present\r\nday. But it is hard, if not impossible, to find a stopping-place.\r\nSome of the facts or accepted conclusions already referred to, and\r\nseveral others, of a more general character, which must be taken into\r\nthe account, impel the theory onward with accumulated force. _Vires_\r\n(not to say _virus) acquirit eundo_. The theory hitches on\r\nwonderfully well to Lyell's uniformitarian theory in geology,--that\r\nthe thing that has been is the thing that is and shall be,--that the\r\nnatural operations now going on will account for all geological\r\nchanges in a quiet and easy way, only give them time enough, so\r\nconnecting the present and the proximate with the farthest past by\r\nalmost imperceptible gradations,--a view which finds large and\r\nincreasing, if not general, acceptance in physical geology, and of\r\nwhich Darwin's theory is the natural complement.\r\n\r\nSo the Darwinian theory, once getting a foothold, marches boldly on,\r\nfollows the supposed near ancestors of our present species farther\r\nand yet farther back into the dim past, and ends with an analogical\r\ninference which \"makes the whole world kin.\" As we said at the\r\nbeginning, this upshot discomposes us. Several features of the theory\r\nhave an uncanny look. They may prove to be innocent: but their first\r\naspect is suspicious, and high authorities pronounce the whole thing\r\nto be positively mischievous.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma we are going to take advice. Following the bent of\r\nour prejudices, and hoping to fortify these by new and strong\r\narguments, we are going now to read the principal reviews which\r\nundertake to demolish the theory;--with what result our readers shall\r\nbe duly informed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we call attention to the fact, that the Appletons have\r\njust brought out a second and revised edition of Mr. Darwin's book,\r\nwith numerous corrections, important additions, and a preface, all\r\nprepared by the author for this edition, in advance of a new English\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVANITY (1).\r\n\r\n(ON A PICTURE OF HERODIAS'S DAUGHTER BY LUINI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, Salome!

A Concise Elementary Treatise on the Sun,\r\nPlanets, Satellites, and Comets_. By O.M. MITCHELL, Director of the\r\nCincinnati and Dudley Observatories. New York. 1860.\r\n\r\nIn this volume Professor Mitchell gives a very clear, and, in the\r\ngeneral plan pursued, a very good account of the methods and results\r\nof investigation in modern astronomy. He has explained with great\r\nfulness the laws of motion of the heavenly bodies, and has thus aimed\r\nat giving more than the collection of disconnected facts which\r\nfrequently form the staple of elementary works on astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, however, he has fallen into errors so numerous, and\r\noccasionally so grave, that they are difficult to be accounted for,\r\nexcept on the supposition that some portions of the work were written\r\nin great haste. Passing over a few mere oversights, such as a\r\nstatement from which it would follow that a transit of Venus occurred\r\nevery eight years, mistakes of dates, etc., we cite the following.\r\n\r\nOn page 114, speaking of Kepler's third law, the author says, \"And\r\neven those extraordinary objects, the revolving double stars, are\r\nsubject to the same controlling law.\" Since Kepler's third law\r\nexpresses a relationship between the motions of three bodies, two of\r\nwhich revolve around a third much larger than either, it is a logical\r\nimpossibility that a system of only two bodies should conform to this\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nOn page 182, it is stated, that Newton's proving, that, if a body\r\nrevolved in an elliptical orbit with the sun as a focus, the force of\r\ngravitation toward the sun would always be in the inverse ratio of\r\nthe square of its distance, \"was equivalent to proving, that, if a\r\nbody in space, free to move, received a single impulse, and at the\r\nsame moment was attracted to a fixed centre by a force which\r\ndiminished as the square of the distance at which it operated\r\nincreased, such a body, thus deflected from its rectilinear path,\r\nwould describe an ellipse,\" etc. Not only does this deduction, being\r\nmade in the logical form,\r\n\r\nIf A is B, X is Y;\r\nbut X is Y;\r\ntherefore A is B,\r\n\r\nnot follow at all, but it is absolutely not true. The body under the\r\ncircumstances might describe an hyperbola as welt as an ellipse, as\r\nProfessor Mitchell himself subsequently remarks.\r\n\r\nThe author's explanation of the manner in which the attraction of the\r\nsun changes the position of the moon's orbit is entirely at fault. He\r\nsupposes the line of nodes of the moon's orbit perpendicular to the\r\nline joining the centres of the earth and sun, and the moon to start\r\nfrom her ascending node toward the sun, and says that in this case\r\nthe effect of the sun's attraction will be to diminish the\r\ninclination of the moon's orbit during the first half of the\r\nrevolution, and thus cause the node to retrograde; and to increase it\r\nduring the second half, and thus cause the nodes to retrograde. But\r\nthe real effect of the sun's attraction, in the case supposed, would\r\nbe to diminish the inclination during the first quarter of its\r\nrevolution, to increase it during the second, to diminish it again\r\nduring the third, and increase it again during the fourth, as shown\r\nby Newton a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XV. we find the greatest number of errors. Take, for\r\nexample, the following computation of the diminution of gravity at\r\nthe surface of the sun in consequence of the centrifugal force,--part\r\nof the data being, that a pound at the earth's surface will weigh\r\ntwenty-eight pounds at the sun's surface, and that the centrifugal\r\nforce at the earth's equator is 1/289 of gravity.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if the sun rotated in the same time as the earth, and their\r\ndiameters were equal, the centrifugal force on the equators of the\r\ntwo orbs would be equal. But the sun's radius is about 111 times that\r\nof the earth, and if the period of rotation were the same, the\r\ncentrifugal force at the sun's equator would be greater than that at\r\nthe earth's in the ratio of (111)^2 to 1, or, more exactly, in the\r\nratio of 12,342.27 to 1. But the sun rotates on its axis much slower\r\nthan the earth, requiring more than 25 days for one revolution. This\r\nwill reduce the above in the ratio of 1 to (25)^2, or 1 to 625; so\r\nthat we shall have the earth's equatorial centrifugal force (1/289) ×\r\n12,342.27 ÷ 625 = 12,342.27/180,605 = 0.07 nearly for the sun's\r\nequatorial centrifugal force. Hence the weight before obtained, 28\r\npounds, must be reduced seven hundredths of its whole value, and we\r\nthus obtain 28 - 0.196 = 27.804 pounds as the true weight of one\r\npound transported from the earth's equator to that of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nIn this calculation we have three errors, the effect of one of which\r\nwould be to increase the true answer 111 times, of another 28 times,\r\nand of a third to diminish it 10 times; so that the final result is\r\nmore than 300 times too great. If this result were correct, Leverrier\r\nwould have no need of looking for intermercurial planets to account\r\nfor the motion of the perihelion of Mercury; he would find a\r\nsufficient cause in the ellipticity of the sun.\r\n\r\nConsidered from a scientific point of view, some of the gravest\r\nerrors into which the author has fallen are the suppositions, that\r\nthe perihelia and nodes of the planetary orbits move uniformly, and\r\nthat they can ever become exactly circular. At the end of about\r\ntwenty-four thousand years the eccentricity of the earth's orbit will\r\nbe smaller than at any other time during the next two hundred\r\nthousand, at least; but it will begin to increase again long before\r\nthe orbit becomes circular. Astronomers have long known that the\r\neccentricity of Mercury's orbit will never be much greater or much\r\nless than it is now; and moreover, instead of diminishing, as stated\r\nby Professor Mitchell, it is increasing, and has been increasing for\r\nthe last hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\nFinally, the chapter closes with an attempt to state the principle\r\nknown to mathematicians as \"the law of the conservation of areas,\"\r\nwhich statement is entirely unlike the correct one in nearly every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we have criticized this work from a\r\nscientific rather than from a popular point of view. As questions of\r\npopular interest, it is perhaps of very little importance whether the\r\nearth's orbit will or will not become circular in the course of\r\nmillions of years, or in what the principle of areas consists or does\r\nnot consist. But if such facts or principles are to be stated at all,\r\nwe have a right to see them stated correctly. However, in the first\r\nnine chapters, which part of the book will be most read, few mistakes\r\nof any importance occur, and the method pursued by Newton in deducing\r\nthe law of gravitation is explained in the author's most felicitous\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_El Fureidîs_. By the Author of \"The Lamplighter\" and \"Mabel\r\nVaughan.\" Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 16mo.\r\n\r\nThat large army of readers whose mere number gave celebrity at once\r\nto the authoress of \"The Lamplighter\" will at first be disappointed\r\nwith what they may call the location of this new romance by Miss\r\nCummins. The scene is laid in Syria, instead of New England, and the\r\n\"village\" known to New Yorkers as Boston gives way to \"El Fureidîs,\"\r\na village in the valley of Lebanon. But while so swift a transition\r\nfrom the West to the East may disappoint that \"Expectation\" which\r\nFletcher tells us \"sits i' the air,\" and which we all know is not to\r\nbe balked with impunity, there can be no doubt, that, in shifting the\r\nscene, the authoress has enabled us to judge her essential talent\r\nwith more accuracy. Possessing none of the elements which are thought\r\nessential to the production of a sensation, \"The Lamplighter\" forced\r\nitself into notice as a \"sensation book.\" The writer was innocent of\r\nall the grave literary crimes implied in such a distinction. The\r\nfirst hundred and fifty pages were as simple, and as true to ordinary\r\nnature, as the daisies and buttercups of the common fields; the\r\nremaining two hundred pages repeated the stereotyped traditions and\r\ncustomary hearsays which make up the capital of every professional\r\nstory-teller. The book began in the spirit of Jane Austen, and ended\r\nin that of Jane Porter.\r\n\r\nIn \"El Fureidîs\" everything really native to the sentiment and\r\nexperience of Miss Cummins is exhibited in its last perfection, with\r\nthe addition of a positive, though not creative, faculty of\r\nimagination. Feeling a strong attraction for all that related to the\r\nEast, through an accidental connection with friends who in\r\nconversation discoursed of its peculiarities and wonders, she was led\r\nto an extensive and thorough study of the numerous eminent scholars\r\nand travellers who have recorded their experience and researches in\r\nSyria and Damascus. Gradually she obtained a vivid internal vision of\r\nthe scenery, and a practical acquaintance with the details of life,\r\nof those far-off Eastern lands. On this imaginative reproduction of\r\nthe external characteristics of the Orient she projected her own\r\nstandards of excellence and ideals of character; and the result is\r\nthe present romance, the most elaborate and the most pleasing\r\nexpression of her genius.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly anything in the work which can rightfully be called\r\nplot. The incidents are not combined, but happen. A shy, sensitive,\r\nfastidious, high-minded, and somewhat melancholy and dissatisfied\r\nEnglishman, by the name of Meredith, travelling from Beyrout to\r\nLebanon, falls in love with a Christian maiden by the name of\r\nHavilah. She rejects him, on the ground, that, however blessed with\r\nall human virtues, he is deficient in Christian graces. One of those\r\nrare women who combine the most exquisite sensuous beauty with the\r\nbeauty of holiness, she cannot consent to marry, unless souls are\r\njoined, as well as hands. Meredith, in the course of the somewhat\r\nrambling narrative, \"experiences religion,\" and the heroine then\r\nfeels for him that affection which she did not feel even in those\r\nmoments when he recklessly risked his life to save hers. In regard to\r\ncharacterization, Meredith, the hero, is throughout a mere name,\r\nwithout personality; but the authoress has succeeded in transforming\r\nHavilah from an abstract proposition into an individual existence.\r\nHer Bedouin lover, the wild, fierce, passionate Arab boy, Abdoul,\r\nwith his vehement wrath and no less vehement love, passing from a\r\nfrustrated design to assassinate Meredith, whom he considered the\r\naccepted lover of Havilah, to an abject prostration of his whole\r\nbeing, corporeal and mental, at the feet of his mistress, saluting\r\nthem with \"a devouring storm of kisses,\" is by far the most intense\r\nand successful effort at characterization in the whole volume. The\r\nconclusion of the story, which results in the acceptance by Meredith\r\nof the conditions enforced by the celestial purity of the heroine,\r\nwill be far less satisfactory to the majority of readers than if\r\nHavilah had been represented as possessed of sufficient spiritual\r\npower to convert her passionate Arab lover into a being fit to be a\r\nChristian husband. By all the accredited rules of the logic of\r\npassion, Abdoul deserved her, rather than Meredith. Leaving, however,\r\nall those considerations which relate to the management of the story\r\nas connected with the impulses of the characters, great praise cannot\r\nbe denied to the authoress for her conception and development of the\r\ncharacter of Havilah. Virgin innocence has rarely been more happily\r\ncombined with intellectual culture, and the reader follows the course\r\nof her thoughts--and so vital are her thoughts that they cause all\r\nthe real events of the story--with a tranquil delight in her\r\nbeautiful simplicity and intelligent affectionateness, compared with\r\nwhich the pleasure derived from the ordinary stimulants of romance is\r\npoor and tame. At least two-thirds of the volume are devoted to\r\ndescriptions of Eastern scenery, habits, customs, manners, and men,\r\nand these are generally excellent. Altogether, the book will add to\r\nthe reputation of the authoress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Life and Times of General Sam. Dale, the Mississippi Partisan_. By\r\nJ.F.H. CLAIBORNE. Illustrated by John M'Lenan. New York: Harper &\r\nBrothers.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of General Dale, Mr. Claiborne tells us, were taken\r\nfrom his own lips by the author and two friends, and from the notes\r\nof all three a memoir was compiled, but the MSS. were lost in the\r\nMississippi. We regret that Dale's own words were thus lost; for the\r\nstories of the hardy partisan are not improved by his biographer's\r\nwell-meant efforts to tell them in more graceful language. Mr.\r\nClaiborne's cheap eloquence is perhaps suited to the unfastidious\r\ntaste of a lower latitude; but we prefer those stories, too few in\r\nnumber, in which the homely words of Dale are preserved.\r\n\r\nDale does not appear to have done anything to warrant this \"attempt\r\non his life,\" being no more remarkable than hundreds of others. He\r\nsaw several distinguished men; but of his anecdotes about them we can\r\nonly quote the old opinion, that the good stories are not new, and\r\nthe new are not good. As there is nothing particularly interesting in\r\nthe subject, so there is no peculiar charm thrown around it by the\r\nmanner in which Mr. Claiborne has executed his task. A noticeable and\r\nvery comic feature is presented in the praises which he has\r\ninterpolated, when ever any acquaintance of his is referred to. We\r\nreadily acquiesce, when we are told that Mr. A is a model citizen,\r\nand that Mr. B is alike unsurpassed in public and private life; but\r\nthe latter statement becomes less intensely gratifying when we learn\r\nthe fact that Mr. C also has no superior, and that there are no\r\nbetter or abler men than D, E, F, or G. We were aware that\r\nMississippi was uncommonly fortunate in having meritorious sons, but\r\nnot that so singularly exact an equality existed among them. Are they\r\nall best? It is like the case of the volunteer regiment in which they\r\nwere all Major-Generals. Occasional eminence we can easily believe,\r\nbut a table-land of merit is more than we are prepared for; and we\r\nare strongly led to suspect that praise so lavishly given may be\r\ncheaply won.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Money-King and Other Poems_. By JOHN G. SAXE. Boston: Ticknor &\r\nFields. 16mo.\r\n\r\nWe regret having overlooked this pleasant volume so long. In a\r\nprevious collection of poems, which has run through fifteen editions,\r\nMr. Saxe fully established his popularity; and the present volume,\r\nwhich is better than its predecessor, has in it all the elements of a\r\nsimilar success. The two longest poems, \"The Money-King\" and \"The\r\nPress,\" have been put to the severe test of repeated delivery before\r\nlyceum audiences in different parts of the country; and a poet is\r\nsure to learn by such a method of publication, what he may not learn\r\nby an appearance in print, the real judgment of the miscellaneous\r\npublic on his performance. He may doubt the justice of the praise or\r\nthe censure of the professional critic; but it is hard for him to\r\nresist the fact of failure, when it comes to him palpably in the\r\nsatire that scowls in an ominous stare and the irony that lurks in an\r\naudible yawn,--hard for him to question the reality of triumph, when\r\nteeth flash at every gleam of his wit and eyes moisten at every touch\r\nof his sentiment. Having tried each of these poems before more than a\r\nhundred audiences, Mr. Saxe has fairly earned the right to face\r\ncritics fearlessly; and, indeed, the poems themselves so abound in\r\nsense, shrewdness, sagacity, and fancy, in sayings so pithy and wit\r\nso sparkling, are so lull of humor and good-humor, and flow on their\r\nrhythmic and rhyming way with so much of the easy abandonment of\r\nvivacious conversation, that few critics will desire to reverse the\r\nfavorable decisions of the audiences they have enlivened.\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous poems, there are many which, in brilliancy,\r\nin keen, good-natured satire, in facility and variety of\r\nversification, in ingenious fancy, in joyousness of spirit and pure\r\nlove of fun, excel the longer poems to which we have just referred.\r\nWe have found the great majority of them exceedingly exhilarating\r\nreading, and, if our limits admitted an extended examination, we feel\r\nsure that the result of the analysis would be the eliciting of\r\nunexpected merits rather than the detection of hidden defects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Say and Seal_. By the Author of \"Wide, Wide World,\" and the Author\r\nof \"Dollars and Cents.\" In Two Volumes. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nAnother story from \"Elizabeth Wetherell\" is a welcome addition to our\r\nscanty stock of American, novels. Our real American novels may be\r\ncounted on our fingers, while the tales that claim the name may be\r\nweighed by the ton. At the present time, we count Hawthorne among our\r\nnovelists, and Mrs. Stowe, and perhaps Curtis, since his \"Trumps\";\r\nbut as for our thousand and one unrivalled authors, \"whose matchless\r\nknowledge of the human heart and wonderful powers of delineation\r\nplace them far above Dickens or Thackeray,\" they are all, from\r\nSylvanus Cobb, Junior, down to Ned Buntline and Gilmore Simms,\r\nbeneath serious notice, and may be left to the easy verdict of the\r\nreaders of the cheap magazines and illustrated newspapers, in whose\r\ncolumns they have gained a world-wide obscurity. Miss Warner's books\r\nhave always a genuine flavor of originality, and an acute, living\r\nappreciation of Yankee character, that give them a right to rank,\r\nunchallenged, as real and valuable novels. In their simplicity, their\r\nfreshness, their quiet humor and not less quiet fun, their frequent\r\nnarrowness and stiffness, and their deep and true religious\r\nsentiment, they have the real essence of the New England character.\r\n\r\nIn every novel there are three principal elements,--the Hero, the\r\nHeroine, the Villain,--all three gracefully blending, in the Plot. We\r\ncannot especially congratulate our authors upon their Hero. In a\r\nfavorite farce, the slightly bewildered Mr. Lullaby observes\r\nmusingly, \"Brown? Brown? That name sounds familiar! I must have heard\r\nthat name before! I'll swear I've heard that name before!\" We have a\r\ndim consciousness of having met \"Mr. Linden\" before, albeit under a\r\ndifferent name. A certain Mr. Humphreys, whom we remember of old,\r\nstrongly resembles him: so does one Mr. Guy Carleton. We were very\r\nwell pleased with our old friend Humphreys, (or Carleton,) and would\r\nby no means hint at any reluctance to meet him again; but a new\r\nnovel, by its very announcement, implies a new hero,--and if we come\r\nupon a plain family-party, when fondly hoping for an introduction to\r\nsome distinguished stranger, we may be excused for thinking ourselves\r\nhardly treated. Is it so infallible a sign of superiority, moreover,\r\nto speak constantly in riddles? This Sphinx-like style is eminently\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Linden. Then again, our authors have been too\r\nambitious. They laboriously assert Mr. Linden to be a marvel of\r\nlearning,--a man of vast and curious literary attainments: but all\r\nthat their hero does to maintain this reputation and vindicate their\r\nopinion is to quote trite passages of poetry, which are all very\r\nwell, but which every gentleman of ordinary cultivation is expected\r\nto know, and which no gentleman of ordinary cultivation is expected\r\nto quote,--things that are remembered only to be avoided as utterly\r\nthreadbare. One unfortunate instance may be found at the beginning of\r\nthe second volume. Mr. Linden's acquirements are to receive peculiar\r\nlustre from a triumph over no ordinary competitor,--over the\r\nintelligent and well-read Doctor Harrison. Naturally, we expect\r\nsomething recondite, and are by no means satisfied with the trite\r\n\r\n  \"Cupid and my Campaspe played\r\n  At cards for kisses,\" etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Linden might as well have astonished the company by such a\r\ntranscendent proof of erudition as\r\n\r\n      \"All the world's a stage,\r\n  And all the men and women,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOr, passing \"from grave to gay, from lively to severe,\" (for novelty\r\nin quotations we find to be contagious,) have recounted the wildly\r\nerratic history \"of that false matron known in nursery rhyme,\r\nInsidious Morey,\" or quoted\r\n\r\n  \"How doth the little busy bee.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he might have soared into unapproachable heights of\r\nsurpassing literary erudition, by informing his awe-struck hearers\r\nthat the latter poem was written by Doctor Watts! The fact is, any\r\nattempt to give the novelist's characters a learning which the\r\nnovelist does not possess is always hazardous.\r\n\r\nThe Heroine, Miss Faith Derrick, is a pretty, but not remarkably\r\noriginal creation, who taxes our magnanimity sorely at times by her\r\nblind admiration of her lover when he is peculiarly absurd, but whose\r\ndumb rejection of Doctor Harrison, though a trifle theatrical, is\r\nreally charming. Faith is better than Linden: Linden is _\"superbe,\r\nmagnifique\"_; but Faith is \"pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nBut the conception of the Villain is very fine. In Doctor Harrison we\r\nhail a new development of that indispensable character. Of course,\r\nthe gentlemanly, good-humored Doctor is not to be considered a\r\nvillain in the ordinary acceptation of the word; he is only a\r\ntechnical villain,--a villain of eminent respectability. It is almost\r\nunnecessary to add, that he is immeasurably more attractive than the\r\nreal hero, Mr. Linden.\r\n\r\nWe regret to say that the conception is not carried out so well as it\r\ndeserves to be. Doctor Harrison descends to some low business, quite\r\nunworthy of him, such as tampering with the mails. This is not only\r\nmortifying, but entirely unnecessary; inasmuch as Doctor Harrison has\r\na subordinate villain to do all the low villany, in the person of\r\nSquire Deacon, who shoots at Mr. Linden from behind a hedge (!), and\r\nis never called to account therefor,--a strange remissness on the\r\npart of everybody, which seems to have no recommendation except that\r\nit leaves him free to do this very work of robbing the mails, and\r\nwhich, by his failure to do it, is left utterly unexplained and\r\nprofoundly mysterious. All this is very bad. The Doctor's meanness is\r\nutterly inconsistent; and the bare thought of a sober and uncommonly\r\nawkward Yankee, like Squire Deacon, deliberately making _two_\r\nseparate attempts at assassination, is unspeakably ludicrous.\r\nMoreover, we are hopelessly unable to see the need of having the\r\nunfortunate Mr. Linden shot at all. Everything was going on very well\r\nbefore, as nearly as we could see, and nothing appears to come of it,\r\nafter all,--not even the condign punishment of the incongruous and\r\nnever-to-be-sufficiently-marvelled-at assassin, who is suspected by\r\nseveral people, and yet remains as unharmed as if murder on the\r\nhighway were altogether too common an occurrence in New England to\r\nexcite more than a moment's thought.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to speak of the Plot; and we are constrained to say\r\nthat a more inartistic, unfinished piece of work we cannot remember.\r\nThere is a lamentable waste of capital on Squire Deacon's\r\nsportsmanlike propensities. Why not have something come of them? We\r\nare not anxious to have the man hanged, or even indicted; but we did\r\nexpect a magnanimous pardon to be extended to him by Mr. Linden; and\r\nalthough that gentleman was altogether too magnanimous before, we\r\nshould have acquiesced mildly. And what becomes of Mrs. Derrick?\r\nThere we are in earnest; for Mrs. Derrick is an especial favorite\r\nwith us. It seems as if our authors had become bewildered, and,\r\nfinding themselves fairly at a loss what to do with their characters,\r\nwho drift helplessly along through a great part of the second volume,\r\nhad seized desperately on the hero and heroine, determined to save\r\nthem at least, and, having borne them to a place of refuge, had\r\nconcluded to let the others look after themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat redeems the novel, and gives it its peculiar and exquisite\r\ncharm, is the execution of certain detached passages. We have never\r\nseen the drollery of a genuine Yankee to more advantage than in \"Say\r\nand Seal.\" An occasional specimen we venture to quote.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Linden's first appearance at Mrs. Derrick's house, where he is\r\nknown only as the new teacher, nobody knows and nobody dares ask his\r\nname; and recourse is accordingly had to the diplomacy of the \"help.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Child,' said Mrs. Derrick, 'what on earth is his name?'\r\n\r\n\"'Mother, how should I know? I didn't ask him.'\r\n\r\n\"'But the thing is,' said Mrs. Derrick, 'I _did_ know; the Committee\r\ntold me all about him. And of course he thinks I know,--and I\r\ndon't,--no more than I do my great-grandmother's name, which I never\r\ndid remember yet.'\r\n\r\n\"'Mother, shall I go and ask him, or wait till after supper?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, you sha'n't go,' said her mother. 'Wait till after supper, and\r\nwe'll send Cindy. He won't care about his name till he gets his tea,\r\nI'll warrant... Faith, don't you think he liked his supper?'\r\n\r\n\"'I should think he would, after having no dinner,' said Faith.\r\n\r\n\"'There's Cindy, this minute! Run and tell her to go right away, and\r\nfind out what his name is,--tell her _I_ want to know,--you can put\r\nit in good words.'\r\n\r\n\"Cindy presently came back, and handed a card to Faith.\r\n\r\n\"'It's easy done,' said Cindy. 'I jest asked him if he'd any\r\nobjections towards tellin' his name,--and he kinder opened his eyes\r\nat me, and said, \"No.\" Then I said, says I, \"Mis' Derrick do' know,\r\nand she'd like ter.\" \"Miss Derrick!\" says he, and he took out his\r\npencil and writ that. But I'd like ter know _what_ he cleans his\r\npencil with,' said Cindy, in conclusion, for I'm free to confess _I_\r\nnever see brass shine so in my born days.'\"\r\n\r\nCindy's \"free confessions\" are an important feature of the book.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI, Squire Deacon and his sister hold a brief Yankee\r\ndialogue, of which this is a sample:--\r\n\r\n\"'Sam! what are you bothering yourself about Mr. Linden for?'\r\n\r\n\"'How long since you was made a trustee?' said the Squire, beginning\r\nhis sentence with an untranslatable sort of grunt, and ending it in\r\nhis teacup.\r\n\r\n\"'I've been _your_ trustee ever since you was up to anything,' said\r\nhis sister. 'Come, Sam,--don't you begin now! What's made you so\r\ncrusty?'\r\n\r\n\"'It a'n't the worst thing to be crusty,' said the Squire. 'Shows a\r\nman's more'n half baked, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, what has he done?'\r\n\r\n\"'Sure enough!' said the Squire, 'what _has_ he done? That's just\r\nwhat I can't find out.'\r\n\r\n\"'What do you want to find out for? What ails him?'\r\n\r\n\"'Suppose he hasn't done nothin'. Is that the sort o' man to teach\r\nlitteratur in Pattaquasset?'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Sam Deacon, what do you expect to do by all this fuss you're\r\nmaking?' said his sister, judicially.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the use of cross-examining a man at that rate? When I do\r\nanything, you'll know it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe characters are all invested with reality by skilfully introduced\r\nanecdotes, or by personal traits carelessly and happily sketched. But\r\nit is a costly expedient to give this reality, when our authors bring\r\nin pet names, and other \"love-lispings,\" which are sacred in privacy\r\nand painfully ridiculous when exposed to the curious light. Many of\r\nus readers find all this mawkish and silly, and others of us are\r\npained that to such scrutiny should be exposed the dearest secrets of\r\naffection, and are not anxious to have them exposed to our own gaze.\r\nIt is too trying a confidence, too high an honor, to be otherwise\r\nthan unwelcome. With this criticism we close our notice of \"Say and\r\nSeal,\" in which we have been sparing neither of praise nor blame,\r\nearnestly thanking the authors for a book that is worth finding fault\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_How Could He Help It? or, The Heart Triumphant_. By A.S. ROE. New\r\nYork: Derby & Jackson.\r\n\r\nA fair representative of a class of books that are always pleasant\r\nreading, although written without taste, cultivation, or\r\noriginality,--because they are obviously dictated by a kind heart and\r\ngenuine earnestness. In this volume the numerous heroes (so similar\r\nin every respect that one might fancy them to be only one hero\r\nmysteriously multiplied, like Kehama) and the fair heroines (exactly\r\nequalling the heroes in number, we are happy to assure the\r\ntenderhearted reader) are not in the least interesting, except for\r\nsheer goodness of heart. This unaided moral excellence, however,\r\nfairly redeems the book, and so far softens even our critical\r\nasperity that we venture only to suggest,--first, that the utterly\r\nunprecedented _patois_ of Mrs. Kelly is not Irish, for which a\r\ncareful examination of the context leads us to think it was\r\nintended,--secondly, that \"if he had have done it\" is equally\r\nguiltless of being English,--thirdly, that, if our author, desiring to\r\ndescribe the feelings of a lover holding his mistress's hand, was\r\ninspired by Tennyson's phrase of \"dear wonder,\" he failed, in our\r\nopinion, to improve on his original, when he substituted \"the fleshy\r\ntreasure in his grasp.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The New Tariff-Bill_. Washington. 1860.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to submit the English of this new literary effort\r\nof the House of Representatives at Washington to a critical\r\nexamination, (though it strikingly reminds us of some of the poems of\r\nMr. Whitman, and is a very fair piece of descriptive verse in the\r\n_b'hoy_-anergic style,) or to attempt any argument on the vexed\r\nquestion of Protection. But there is a section of the proposed act\r\nwhich has a direct interest not only for all scholars, but for that\r\nlarge and constantly increasing class whose thirst for what may be\r\ncalled voluminous knowledge prompts them to buy all those\r\nshelf-ornamenting works without which no gentleman's library can be\r\nconsidered complete. Though in the matter of book-buying the\r\ncharacters of gentleman and scholar, so seldom united, are\r\ndistinguished from each other with remarkable precision,--the desire\r\nof the former being to cover the walls of what he superstitiously\r\ncalls his \"study,\" and that of the latter to line his head, while the\r\nresultant wisdom is measured respectively by volume and by mass,--yet\r\nit is equally important to both that the literary furniture of the\r\none and the intellectual tools of the other should be cheap.\r\n\r\nThe \"Providence Journal\" deserves the thanks of all students for\r\nhaving called attention to the fact, that, under the proposed tariff,\r\nthe duties will be materially increased on two classes of foreign\r\nbooks: the cheap ones, like \"Bohn's Library,\"--and the bulky, but\r\noften indispensable ones, such as the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" The\r\nnew bill, in short, proposes to substitute for the old duty of eight\r\n_per cent. ad valorem_ a new one of fifteen cents the pound weight.\r\nCould we suspect a Committee of Members of Congress of a joke\r\nappreciable by mere members of the human family, could we suppose\r\nthem in a thoughtless moment to have carried into legislation a\r\nmildened modicum of that metaphorical language which forms the staple\r\nof debate, we should make no remonstrance. We recognize the severe\r\njustice of an ideal avoirdupois in literary criticism. We remember\r\nthe unconscious sarcasm of the Atlantic Telegraph, as it sank\r\nheart-broken under the strain of conveying the answer of the Heavy Father\r\nof our political stage to the graceful \"good-morning\" of Victoria.\r\nThe enthusiastic member of the Academy of Lagado, who had spent eight\r\nyears in a vain attempt to extract sunbeams from cucumbers, might\r\nhave found profitable employment in smelting the lead even from light\r\nliterature, not to speak of richer deposits. Under an act thus\r\ndubiously worded, and in a country which makes Bancroft a collector\r\nof the customs and Hawthorne a weigher and gauger, the works of an\r\nAlison and a Tupper would be put beyond the reach of all but the\r\nimmensely rich. The man of moderate means would be deprived of the\r\nexhaustless misinformation of the Scottish Baronet, who has so\r\ncompletely disproved the old charge against his countrymen of\r\npossessing an _ingenium perfervidum_, (which Dr. Johnson would have\r\ntranslated by _brimstone temperament_,) and of the don't-fail-to-\r\nspread-your-umbrella-when-it-rains-or-you'll-spoil-your-hat wisdom of\r\nthe English Commoner, who seems to have named his chief work in a\r\nmoment of abnormal inspiration, since it has become proverbial as the\r\nseverest test of human philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot suspect the Congressional Committee of a joke, still\r\nless of a joke at the expense of those anglers in the literary\r\ncurrent whose tackle, however bare of bait, never fails of a sinker\r\nat the end of every line. They have been taught to look upon books as\r\nin no wise differing from cotton and tobacco, and rate them\r\naccordingly by a merely material standard. It has been the dealers in\r\nbooks, and not the makers of them, who have hitherto contrived to\r\ndirect public opinion in this matter. We look upon Public Opinion\r\nwith no superstitious reverence,--for Tom's way of thinking is none\r\nthe wiser because the million other Toms and Dicks and Harries agree\r\nwith him,--nevertheless, even a fetish may justly become an object of\r\nrespectful interest to one who is to be sacrificed to it.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be with iron, wool, and manufactured cotton, it is\r\nclear that a duty on books is not protective of American literature,\r\nbut simply a tax on American scholarship and refinement. The\r\nimperfectness of our public libraries compels every student to depend\r\nmore or less upon his own private collection of books; and it is a\r\nfact of some significance, that, with the single exception of\r\nHildreth, all our prominent historians, Sparks, Irving, Bancroft,\r\nPrescott, Ticknor, Motley, and Palfrey, have been men of independent\r\nfortune. If anything should be free of duty, it should seem to be the\r\nmaterial of thought.\r\n\r\nIf Congress be really desirous of doing something for the benefit of\r\nAmerican authors, it would come nearer the mark, if it directed its\r\nattention to the establishment on equitable grounds of some system of\r\nInternational Copyright. A well-considered enactment to this end\r\nwould, we are convinced, be quite as advantageous to the\r\nmanufacturers as to the producers of books. We believe that a\r\nmajority of the large publishing houses of the country have been\r\ngradually convinced of the inconveniences of the present want of\r\nsystem. Many of them have found it profitable to enter into an\r\nagreement with popular English authors for the payment of copyright,\r\nand works thus reprinted cost the buyer no more than under the\r\nprivateering policy. But without some definite establishment of legal\r\nrights and remedies, the publisher is at the mercy of a dishonorable,\r\nsometimes of a vindictive competition, and must run the risk of\r\nhaving the market flooded within a week with a cheaper and inferior\r\nedition, reprinted from the sheets of his own which had been\r\nhonorably paid for. We do not pretend to argue the question of\r\nliterary property, the principle of it being admitted in the fact\r\nthat we have any copyright-laws at all. Our wish is to show, that, in\r\nthe present absence of settled law, the honest publisher is subjected\r\nto risks from the resultant evils of which the whole reading\r\ncommunity suffers. The publisher, to protect himself, is forced to\r\nmake his reprint as cheaply as possible, and to hurry it through the\r\npress with the disregard of accuracy inseparable from hasty\r\npublication,--while the reader is put in possession of a book\r\ndestructive of eyesight, crowded with blunders, and unsightly in\r\nappearance. Maps and plates are omitted, or copied so carelessly as\r\nto be worse than useless; and whoever needs the book for study or\r\nreference must still buy the original edition, made more costly\r\nbecause imported in single copies, and because taxed for the\r\nprotection of a state of things discreditable in every way, and not\r\nonly so, but hostile to the true interests of both publishers and\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWe do not claim any protection of American authorship from foreign\r\ncompetition, but we cannot but think it unfair that British\r\nauthorship should be protected (as it now practically is) at the cost\r\nof our own, and for the benefit of such publishers as are willing to\r\nconvey an English book without paying for it. The reprint of a\r\nsecond-rate work by an English author has not only the advantage of a\r\nstolen cheapness over a first-rate one on the same subject by an\r\nAmerican, but may even be the means of suppressing it altogether. The\r\nintellectual position of an American is so favorable for the\r\ntreatment of European history as to overbalance in some instances the\r\ndisadvantages arising from want of access to original documents; yet\r\nan American author whose work was yet in manuscript could not\r\npossibly compete with an English rival, even of far inferior ability,\r\nwho had already published. If, within the last few years, a tolerably\r\npopular history of France had been published in England, and cheaply\r\nreprinted here, (as it surely would have been,) we doubt whether Mr.\r\nGodwin would have undertaken his laborious and elaborate work,--or,\r\nif he had, whether he would have readily found a bookseller bold\r\nenough to pay an adequate price for the copyright. And it is to be\r\nremembered that an American publisher gives this preference to an\r\nEnglish over an American book simply because he can get it for\r\nnothing, by defrauding its author of the just reward of his industry\r\nor genius. That an author loses his equitable claim to copyright for\r\nthe simple reason that by publication he has put himself in our power\r\nis an argument fit to be used only by one who would make use of a\r\nprivate letter that had accidentally come into his possession to the\r\ndamage of the writer.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some kind of equitable arrangement was so strongly\r\nfelt by American publishers that a kind of unwritten law gradually\r\nestablished itself among them. It was tacitly understood, that, when\r\na publisher had paid an English author for advance sheets, no rival\r\nAmerican edition should be published. But it already appears too\r\nplainly that an arrangement with no guaranty but a private sense of\r\nhonor is liable to constant infringement for the gratification of\r\npersonal enmity, or in the hope of immediate profit. The rewards of\r\nuprightness and honorable dealing are slow in coming, while those of\r\nunscrupulous greed are immediate, even though dirty. Under existing\r\ncircumstances, free-trade and fair-play exist only in appearance: for\r\nthe extraordinary claim has been set up, that an American bookseller\r\nhas an exclusive right to all the future works of an English author\r\nany one of whose former productions he has reprinted, whether with or\r\nwithout paying for it; so that, however willing another publisher may\r\nbe to give the author a fair price for his book, or however desirous\r\nthe latter may be to conclude such a bargain, it is practically\r\nimpossible, so long as privateering is tolerated in the trade.\r\n\r\nWe have said nothing of the advantages which would accrue to our own\r\nauthors from a definite settlement of the question of international\r\ncopyright between England and America. How great these would be is\r\nplain from the fact that the editions of American books republished\r\nin England are already numbered by thousands. With the growth of the\r\nEnglish Colonies the value to an American author of an English\r\ncopyright is daily increasing. Indeed, it is a matter of\r\nconsideration for our publishers, whether Canada may not before long\r\nretaliate upon them, and by cheaper reprints become as troublesome to\r\nthem as Belgium once was to France.\r\n\r\nIt is not creditable that America should be the last of civilized\r\nnations to acknowledge the justice of an author's claim to a share in\r\nthe profits of a commercial value which he has absolutely created.\r\nEngland is more liberal to our authors than we to hers, but it is\r\nonly under certain strictly limited contingencies that an American\r\ncan acquire copyright there. Were all our booksellers as scrupulous\r\nas the few honorably exceptional ones among them now are, there would\r\nbe no need of legislative regulation; but, in the present condition\r\nof things, he who undertakes to reprint an English book which he has\r\nhonestly paid for is at the mercy of whoever can get credit for poor\r\npaper and worse printing. There is no reason why a distinction should\r\nbe made between copy-right and patent-right; but, if our legislators\r\nrefuse to admit any abstract right in the matter, they might at least\r\ngo so far as to conclude an international arrangement by which a\r\npublisher in either country who was willing to pay for the right of\r\npublication should be protected in its exercise. No just objection\r\ncould be made to a plan of this kind, which, if not so honest as a\r\ngeneral international law of copyright, would be profitable to our\r\npublishers, and to such of our authors at least as had acquired any\r\nforeign reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AMERICAN PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nRECEIVED BY THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of the First Three Centuries; or, Notices of the Lives and\r\nOpinions of Some of the Early Fathers, with Special Reference to the\r\nDoctrine of the Trinity; illustrating its Late Origin and Gradual\r\nFormation.
